I just watch this movie last night and I could not speak or express any type of feeling because this film was so brilliant, also I never understood this film for a second but that is what I think that Stanly wanted. The First 25 minutes not one word is said and you just watch how maybe man came into being because of this big black block. I don't know what that block is it could be god or maybe it's something that will never be understand and maybe it's the key to everything we need to know about life, space and everything we hold dear, but I think thats what started the first intelligence in man. that block could hold all of our future and that black block could be flying in space as we talk and sleep creating life on other planets, it could be aliens spying on us since it's buried and humans uncover it what would happen? Maybe it created everything that exist and thing that we don't exist yet. I could go on forever on the possibility's if that black block does exist but what if it does and then my entire life could change for ever. Hal is portably the best voice over acting I have ever heard and is provably the best villain ever created. The acting is superb for a film were not one word is said for more than half of the movie. This film has with out a dought one of the best special effects and it's about 40 years old. This Film has made me question what I think about in a good way. I always new that the universe goes on forever but this film made understand how we know nothing about space. This Film has bought so many question that I dought I will never understand them all before I die. This film has probably one of the best special effects ever. The music of this movie is great and it fit the movie like no other. I liked that when ever the film goes out of the space shuttle there's no sound or music and it creates a scary and makes you feel alone and that really feat the movie. This is probably the best movie I have ever seen and probably the best I will ever see.I have heard that you will understand this movie better if you see this movie a lot of times, but I'm scared to see this film more times cause I might not like this movie once I understand, But I will see this movie again cause it's probably my new all favorite film.

Well, I just recently saw it again, after years of not watching it. I must say that this time around I found the story more interesting and the effects hold amazingly well for a 26 year old movie. The main problem with DRAGONSLAYER is that none of the characters are strong enough or well developed and I didn't feel anything for the character's, except maybe Caitlin Clarke (which I thought she was hot!). I get the impression that the movie is one big set up for the climatic battle with the dragon, and in this respect, I thought that scene was very anti climatic. DRAGONSLAYER begged to have a better direction and a better editing. Alex North's score is richly symphonic but is criminally misplaced all over the film. You get supposedly quiet scenes and the music playing behind is fast paced and furious. There's no sense of timing with the music. It's as if though North composed the soundtrack regardless of what went on in the film. And Ralph Richardson's character as sorcerer Ulrich is a great waste of talent. What could have been a great mix of Kenobi\/Merlin\/Gandalf\/Yoda was rendered poorly, I think. In short, DRAGONSLAYER is a fun movie to watch that had all the potential to be as good and as big as 1981's true blockbuster RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.

Meanwhile boxing promoter Turkish (Jason Statham) & his mate Tommy (Stephen Graham) are in big trouble as they have let down a vicious crime boss named Brick Top (Alan Ford), throw in some Irish pikey's, unlicensed boxing matches, dead bodies, betting shop hold ups & add hard as nails Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) hired to sort everything out as everyone's problems become connected...This British American co-production was written & directed by Madonna's other half Guy Ritchie & I'll say it straight away, Snatch is one of my favourite films of all time, period. I must admit after watching it again last night I wasn't looking forward to looking it up on the IMDb for fear of a horribly low score & lots of complaints from people about not understanding or getting it, particularly Americans, so imagine my surprise & delight when I discovered that Snatch is in fact in the IMDb's Top 250 films list (currently #183 but this will change sooner or later) & it certainly isn't a film which I thought would come into most people's heads when talking about the best 200 odd films ever made so I guess it's a testament to just how good Snatch is in that after 7 years from it's original release it still holds a place in the IMDb's Top 250 films of all time. A place, I might add, that I think it fully deserves. 'Who took the jam outta your doughnut?', 'You took the f*cking jam outta my doughnut!'. The script by Ritchie is quite simply the funniest thing ever put to film, I have seen Snatch several times & I still p*ss myself laughing at some of the one-liners, sarcastic jokes, humour, twists, character's & events. Snatch has more quotable lines of dialogue in it than any other film I've seen, I myself have used the 'how did you lose it, it's hardly a set of f*cking car keys' line so many times & never miss an opportunity to use it! The whole film maybe gets a little bit too silly at the end but who cares when it's this clever, this fun, this hilarious & this entertaining? 'What's in the car?', 'Seats and a steering wheel'. I'm sorry, I just love the one-liners in this & can just quote them all day long & not get bored. I love Snatch, I thinks it is absolutely brilliant in every single way from the character's to the clever plot which keeps you on your toes to the hilariously funny dialogue. Snatch is one of the few films about which I simply can't find anything negative to say at all, the absolutely perfect film to watch with some mates on DVD.Director Ritchie pulls out all the stop with an incredibly stylish & fast moving comedy crime thriller, the editing, the camera moves & the dull colour schemes which sum up the British weather perfectly just work like a dream in every respect. There's not much graphic violence although there's loads of profanity & bad language. There's plenty of clever visual gags as well as the funny one-liners & Snatch is just great to both listen to & watch. 'There are two types of balls. There are big brave balls & there are little mincey faggot balls.'With a modest sounding budget of about $10,000,000, well by Hollywood standards it's modest, Snatch has a perfect gloomy British look to it & there's some nice location shooting in & around London. The acting is brilliant from a great cast, everyone plays their roles straight & it's just so funny.Snatch is just about the perfect film, still being in the IMDb Top 250 films is by no means a guarantee of quality but it proves it has legs across a broad range of people most of who I'm pleased to discover get it & love it as much as I do. Guy Ritchie will never make another film as good as Snatch (just look at his next full feature film Swept Away (2002) staring his wife Madonna) & you will never see as good a comedy crime thriller as Snatch, that I promise you.

Meanwhile boxing promoter Turkish (Jason Statham) & his mate Tommy (Stephen Graham) are in big trouble as they have let down a vicious crime boss named Brick Top (Alan Ford), throw in some Irish pikey's, unlicensed boxing matches, dead bodies, betting shop hold ups & add hard as nails Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) hired to sort everything out as everyone's problems become connected...This British American co-production was written & directed by Madonna's other half Guy Ritchie & I'll say it straight away, Snatch is one of my favourite films of all time, period. I must admit after watching it again last night I wasn't looking forward to looking it up on the IMDb for fear of a horribly low score & lots of complaints from people about not understanding or getting it, particularly Americans, so imagine my surprise & delight when I discovered that Snatch is in fact in the IMDb's Top 250 films list (currently #183 but this will change sooner or later) & it certainly isn't a film which I thought would come into most people's heads when talking about the best 200 odd films ever made so I guess it's a testament to just how good Snatch is in that after 7 years from it's original release it still holds a place in the IMDb's Top 250 films of all time. A place, I might add, that I think it fully deserves. 'Who took the jam outta your doughnut?', 'You took the f*cking jam outta my doughnut!'. The script by Ritchie is quite simply the funniest thing ever put to film, I have seen Snatch several times & I still p*ss myself laughing at some of the one-liners, sarcastic jokes, humour, twists, character's & events. Snatch has more quotable lines of dialogue in it than any other film I've seen, I myself have used the 'how did you lose it, it's hardly a set of f*cking car keys' line so many times & never miss an opportunity to use it! The whole film maybe gets a little bit too silly at the end but who cares when it's this clever, this fun, this hilarious & this entertaining? 'What's in the car?', 'Seats and a steering wheel'. I'm sorry, I just love the one-liners in this & can just quote them all day long & not get bored. I love Snatch, I thinks it is absolutely brilliant in every single way from the character's to the clever plot which keeps you on your toes to the hilariously funny dialogue. Snatch is one of the few films about which I simply can't find anything negative to say at all, the absolutely perfect film to watch with some mates on DVD.Director Ritchie pulls out all the stop with an incredibly stylish & fast moving comedy crime thriller, the editing, the camera moves & the dull colour schemes which sum up the British weather perfectly just work like a dream in every respect. There's not much graphic violence although there's loads of profanity & bad language. There's plenty of clever visual gags as well as the funny one-liners & Snatch is just great to both listen to & watch. 'There are two types of balls. There are big brave balls & there are little mincey faggot balls.'With a modest sounding budget of about $10,000,000, well by Hollywood standards it's modest, Snatch has a perfect gloomy British look to it & there's some nice location shooting in & around London.

This was a theme which may well have raised some eyebrows in 1983, although, as Tom Cruise was actually 21 at the time, the film was spared the fate which befell all those Traci Lords films from around the same time.The teenager in question is Joel Goodsen, the son of a wealthy Chicago family who is left at home when his parents go away on holiday. The name Goodsen was presumably chosen as a pun, but young Joel does not turn out to be quite such a good son as his parents had imagined. Almost the first thing he does, egged on by his cocky friend Miles, is to ring up an escort agency to order the services of a hooker. As the law does not recognise contracts tainted by immorality, prostitutes cannot sue their clients over unpaid bills for services rendered, so I always assumed that they insist that the price be agreed and the money handed over before any sexual activity takes place. In this case, however, it is only after Joel has spent a night of passion with the lovely Lana that she informs him that he owes her $300 dollars, far more than he can afford. I won't go into all the complications of the plot which follow on from this point, but they involve the theft of a valuable ornament belonging to Joel's mother, his trying to rescue Lana from her killer pimp Guido and his accidentally driving his father's Porsche into Lake Michigan. As he has been specifically warned not to drive this car, he desperately needs funds to pay for the repairs before his parents get back, and comes up with the idea of turning the family home into a brothel where Lana and her friends can entertain his classmates.Joel is a member of Future Enterprisers, a scheme for young people to learn the ways of the commercial world by starting up their own mini-businesses. He claims his brothel enterprise as his entry in the scheme, stating that he has made his money by dealing in human fulfilment. These words give a clue as to the original idea behind the film, which seems to have been conceived as a curious hybrid, a mixture of teenage sex comedy and satire on the capitalist mentality of the yuppie eighties. (Think Porky's meets Wall Street). Paul Brickman's original idea was to end the film on a downbeat note, showing the adverse consequences of Joel's irresponsible behaviour. Unfortunately, this ending proved unpopular with the test audience, and so it was changed to bring the film into line with the conventions of the teenage comedy. Joel is accepted by Princeton (despite having an unspectacular academic record), Lana becomes his steady girlfriend, presumably on the understanding that she will give up her former line of work, and he avoids getting into serious trouble with his parents, other than having to pay for the ornament which has been recovered slightly damaged. Even Guido the killer pimp proves to be less dangerous than that description might suggest; his method of dealing with those who cross him is not murder or GBH but simply stealing their furniture.This was Tom Cruise's first starring role, but he does not give any real hint that he would go on to become a major Hollywood name. Joel comes across as an irritatingly smug and cocksure young man, and in his pretty boy phase of the mid-eighties few could do cocksure better than Cruise. (See Cocktail for a performance even more irritating than this one). Although Cruise was not actually a member of the Brat Pack of the eighties, he had a similar screen persona to some of the Brat Packers.The message of the film seems to be (to quote Miles) Every now and then say, 'What the heck'. 'What the heck' gives you freedom. Freedom brings opportunity. Opportunity makes your future. (I have substituted heck for Miles' rather earthier expletive). This message was presumably originally intended satirically, but the change of ending has robbed the film of any satirical integrity it might have possessed. The film in its present form does not enlighten us as to the mentality behind greed is good, the dot.com boom and bust or the Enron affair. Rather, it ends up as a smug, self-satisfied film which celebrates America's capitalist culture rather than satirises it.

But then we move into a bar where an aging Clint Eastwood is sharing a cocktail with a twenty-something colleague of the opposite sex. She's very attractive, and I'm not sure how much they paid her for her short part, but being forced to swap spit with someone old enough to be her great grandfather should have made her eligible for hazardous duty pay. I'm sure there are a few aging baby boomers who still find Clint sexy, but that scene was done better in Scary Movie 4, and much more appropriate in a comedy.Now who didn't see the car crash coming? A young lady has a few drinks, leaves the bar, the scene outside was heavy with fog and foreshadowing. Then we see her fiddling with the radio in pouring rain. We all know what's going to happen and thus the crash is absolutely gratuitous. Gratuitous and over the top what could have taken less than a second seems to go on forever and ever as the tires screech and car spins again and again and again. Later we learn that she died on Dead Man's Curve. Can you say cliché? The clichés don't end there. In fact, they just don't end. Eastwood plays a recovering drunk, on the way out, hoping to reclaim his lost reputation. Everywhere he turns, he finds brick walls. The district attorney is a cliché convinced that the person about to be executed is guilty. Eastwood's boss is a cliché on his case, wants him gone, sure he's back on the bottle. Eastwood is the only one convinced that the convict is innocent and he's got just a few hours to save him. The stuff exciting endings are made of.But then we see a flashback of the actual murder. The accused, played by Isaiah Washington, is in the store's bathroom, when the victim is shot. He runs out, drops to his knees, and panics. He calls for help and tries to give the girl mouth to mouth resuscitation, when in walks a customer wanting to make a phone call. He stands up and then suddenly remembers he's a cliché of a black man. We can almost hear his thoughts Oh geesus, I's be black. Dat white man gonna think I done killed dis white girl. Feet don't fail me now! and he runs from the scene of the crime.Good lord. Nobody, I repeat, NOBODY in the middle of a life or death crisis who is trying to save the life of another human being breaks out of that mode of thought to think about his own petty personal world. This was the bullcrap upon which this whole story turns? Well, at this point, they lost me entirely.I jumped ahead to the exciting final moments with Eastwood driving his beater recklessly to the Governor's house with his witness in the car with him.Just in the nick of time.Finally, to fulfill the cliché ridden beginning and middle, we end with a Christmas cliché. Eastwood is out shopping, he exits the store, looks up, and sees the convict whose life he saved out shopping with his family. Yes, two perfect strangers brought together by coincidence, with one alive only because of the hard work and determination of the other, will always meet later during the season of joy. Believe me, I did not get the warm and fuzzies.If I ever see this title listed in my television's guide, I will immediately say to myself I'd rather be waterboarded.

So when I picked up the DVD I had completely forgotten which Eastwood western this one was. As such I was expecting a classic Clint Eastwood western with the patented Eastwood glare radiating from his character.But the film is so much more than that. Unlike the plethora of other westerns this one has a definite Kurosawa influence. The themes and mythos employed are joined together with incredible editing and solid cinematography. To top it off the emoting by the cast is appropriately theatrical for the type of film this is. Plot, story, and general film movement come together to present a classic myth of biblical proportions in terms of theme.But like all great films there are a few flaws. Not many, but stand out ever so mildly. Some back-story needed explicit exposition. If I understand correctly it seems to have been intentionally left out, giving the film that much more of an artistic fog for the audience puzzle over. But, properly shot, the back-story may have offered a closure to some logical loopholes. That, and it may have added some needed gun-play to help set the stage for the film.The other quibble is with the final confrontation between the Marshal and Eastwood's character. Without unveiling a possible spoiler I'll say that it was needlessly over the top just prior to the climax, and again needed more gun-play before the moment of truth.Having ridden horses and fired guns when I was younger, and spent a good portion of my childhood in the Sierrra Nevadas, I can say that this film brought the mountainous border of California to life in this film.Now, my one real gripe is with the DVD transfer. I'd seen this a few times on TV on what used to be the independent KTVU Channel 2 (now regrettably a Fox affiliate), and the print they showed was always crisp and clear. The current DVD release needs a good deal of revamping. The color temperature is skewed in the opening, the film is dark much of the time, and the overall image is borderline grainy but just unimpressive overall. The film's actual content makes up for a lot of this, but it's somewhat hard to watch.A magnificent western that's not in the traditional western vein, and because of this, is so much more. But a few minor plot holes and poor DVD execution just make it merely an enjoyable experience. Then again that's all one can really ask for.If you're tired of a lot of the usual shoot-em-up bang-bang western with white hats and black hats, then check out Eastwood's classic. If you can over look the mediocre DVD transfer you should enjoy yourself.

It has plenty of moments that make you cringe at the bad acting and even worse attempts at spoofing the dozens of movies it takes aim at. Yet it has aged remarkably well and I'd rather watch this than a good number of the late-80s and early-90s movies it spoofs.Samuel L. Jackson and Emilio Estevez were very well cast for the lead roles. Imagining Jackson in a comedic role is a bit hard until you see how well he pulls it off in this movie, and he delivers some of the most memorable lines in the movie. Estevez is cast in a character that purposely requires a lot of over-acting and he does quite a good job at it. I think this is the most watchable of any movie where he is in a lead role.As others have mentioned, the number of recognizable names and cameos in this movie is pretty amazing for a movie that is pretty much a cheap shot at the movies that were popular when it was made. Charlie Sheen, Emilio Estevez's bother and a star of the Hot Shots! movies being made around the same time, appears in one scene. William Shatner, already known for being campy, puts his reputation to good use in playing General Mortars and makes the bad guy of the movie look absurd. Kathy Ireland just plain can't act although that may have been purposeful in this movie since it works for her role as Ms. Demeanor. James Doohan, Bruce Willis, Whoopie Goldberg, Dennis Leary, Joyce Brothers, and Phil Hartman are some of the other notable cameos and roles. Of course who could forget the lead characters from CHiPs appearing, too.I have to watch this at least a couple times a year and discover something new nearly every time I watch it. I can understand why it gets low ratings here, since if the movie is dissected enough it really doesn't stand up to much scrutiny, but as a whole it works very well as a spoof.

We're used to all its madcap editing and photography now thanks to television and music videos, and we can only sit back and imagine (or try to remember) what it looked like through eyes that had never seen anything like it before. Watching it today, A Hard Day's Night still seems fresh and original, because it's still different (we're used to music videos, but not feature-length music videos), but to the 1960's audience it would have seemed entirely different from anything they had previously seen (especially if they were expecting a traditional rock musical, considering that the only good one of those made prior to this which I've seen is Go Johnny Go).Lester infuses the film with nonstop quick cutting and energetic pacing, giving the film an almost documentary-like feel (and somehow managing to integrate the biggest pop band in the world into the French 'nouvelle vague' style of film-making). When Orson Welles was interviewed in Playboy magazine in 1967 he said that the film directors that appealed to him the most were 'the old masters- by which I mean John Ford, John Ford, and John Ford.

It seems absurd after Kubrick's long and distinguished career and Lester's career which while featuring some famously good films, also includes Butch and Sundance The Early Days (a cheap prequel with none of the original cast), and the notoriously horrible Superman III to compare the two directors, but looking at Welles' reasoning behind loving John Ford films, it all makes sense. A Hard Day's Night really does feel real, we are basically transported into a day in The Beatles' life and given a VIP pass to accompany them wherever they go. It's a fascinating adventure which the screenplay handles very well. The Beatles were not actors, but they really come off as themselves because all they have to be is the cocky, wisecracking, and rather charming men they were in real life. The screenwriter is smart enough not to provide them with any real acting, which really helps the film.

The film is effortlessly charming, relying on the Beatles' natural charisma to carry the film but also including enough wit to warrant comparisons to later great British comedies and also to the later Beatles films (including Lester's later, slightly funnier and more experimental Help!).

The rest of the larger than life over the top character's are fantastic too, from the criminally underused dominatrix played by Lucy Liu to the funny Fairfax played by James Coburn to the menacing Bronson played by Kristofferson. It moves along at a nice pace, it has a pretty clever & absorbing plot with some cool twists & turns along with a great ending.

It's a colour scheme which suits it down to the ground though & is very stylish, the recent director's cut is not tinted in this way & the colour is more vibrant. The violence isn't that excessive but it is fairly brutal at times, Gibson putting a cushion over someones face & shooting them in the head at point bland range for instance & there's a scene where Gibson is tortured which has a bit with a hammer which will make the squeamish amongst you wince. I didn't like the fact that the dog survived being shot in this version though & more realistically it dies in the director's cut. There are some good action scenes & set-pieces as well including some cool sequences with Pearl the dominatrix.With an estimated budget of about $50,000,000 this is very stylishly made, the production design is great & it's a cool film visually.

I know Carpenter cut several scenes in the final cut, which i seen photos of scenes are not in the movie from different magazines. Including an different ending wasn't used in the final cut. Which involved the character of Linda and John sitting in a dark movie theater. Probably one of few flaws of Carpenter's movie from being perfect. It's not very scary as it should have been or creepy but Carpenter's makes it up by giving it plenty of atmosphere, stylish sequences and good performances by the cast.The famous scene where Cane rips himself as a piece of paper was done by George Lucas' effects company Industrial, Light & Magic is one of the highlights. Which it was originally written as a scene, where everything in the fictional was supposed to be sucked back in the latest book of Cane. But that effect was too ambitious and probably didn't have enough money of effects budget. Which the budget of the movie was $10 million (The original budget was $15 million before New Line Cinema changed it). Although that sucked back in the book sequence was supposed to be filmed but the special effects company thought it would be great if Cane ripped himself instead.

Carpenter's does one of his best work as a filmmaker, which he gives plenty of suspense and it is probably the most stylish of his movies. This mysterious horror fantasy got mixed reviews back in 1995 and it didn't find an audience of this movie. Which it could have been Carpenter's comeback film and this film wasn't well marketed as well. It was released in the early winter of 1995.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.351) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also has an technical commentary track by the director and cinematographer Gary B. Kibbe (Escape from L.A., Vampires, Village of the Damned 1995). DVD also has the original theatrical trailer and cast & crew information. I know Carpenter cut several scenes in the final cut, which i seen photos of scenes are not in the movie from different magazines. Including an different ending wasn't used in the final cut. Which involved the character of Linda and John sitting in a dark movie theater. Probably one of few flaws of Carpenter's movie from being perfect. It's not very scary as it should have been or creepy but Carpenter's makes it up by giving it plenty of atmosphere, stylish sequences and good performances by the cast.The famous scene where Cane rips himself as a piece of paper was done by George Lucas' effects company Industrial, Light & Magic is one of the highlights. Which it was originally written as a scene, where everything in the fictional was supposed to be sucked back in the latest book of Cane. But that effect was too ambitious and probably didn't have enough money of effects budget. Which the budget of the movie was $10 million (The original budget was $15 million before New Line Cinema changed it). Although that sucked back in the book sequence was supposed to be filmed but the special effects company thought it would be great if Cane ripped himself instead. Which that similar sequence was never filmed was done later back in 1995 in a different movie called same year was Jumanji, where the game sucked back all the wild animals, the hunter and various poison plants back into the board game. In the Mouth of Madness asks the audiences more questions than by giving you answers. Which this keeps this movie mysterious. I felt it was an excellent movie, when i was younger. But once you are older, you could see certain flaws. But it doesn't keep from being a boring movie. I think, it's still a very good movie and i know, it has a huge cult following like many Carpenter's movies. Carpenter co-written the music score along with Jim Lang. Some familiar faces appears in Cameos. Don't miss this ambitious movie that mixes Horror, Suspense, Fantasy and Black Comedy as well. Written by Michael De Luca (Freddy's DeadThe Final Nightmare, Judge Dreed). Which De Luca and Carpenter were certainly inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Panavision. (****\/*****).

Even though film music buffs know that during the ghost scene Spielberg cut out a lot of the music that Jerry had written, still, the film stands well even though it is now over 20 years old. The music is stunning and beautiful.This was the era when Spielberg did serious movies that were much more enjoyable than he does now. He remembered that audiences want to be entertained and horrified but not be overwhelmed by special effects and nothing else. True, the special effects in the film were great, but they did not overshadow the storyline like War of the Worlds or Majority Report, Spielberg's modern BOMBS.Everyone can relate to the simple ghost story presented here. At least Spielberg seemed to know how to direct children in this movie. I don't know why he has failed in so many recent movies.

The first 4 minutes had mysterious back ground score with blank screen after which the movie started.The first chapter of the movie The dawn of man had 15 minutes sequence in a desert,which was supposed to be Africa 4 million years ago ,where we see various activity of historic apes .It had no conversation,just various visuals communicating evolutionary concepts,especially the usage of tool.We also see a black rectangular wall like thing(which is called as monolith in this story) which appears mysteriously on a overnight .We see fear,curiosity of apes on the mysterious monolith.The ape learns to use tool,the first turning point of mankind.I think the 15 minutes ape sequence is controversial especially for casual viewers of cinema.In fact it made me bored and also restless,irritating as we cannot understand what was happening in screen.By reading the story in internet websites,i came to know that visuals communicated evolutionary concepts,especially the usage of tooletc.But i was not very impressed of the ape sequence,because i feltthings explained in that 15minutes were not that important to story,as well as little boring.But i was really stunned by the subsequent 2 hours. Now we see the ape learning to use first ever tool and is been thrown which cuts to space ship, which indicates the progression of tool in the evolutionary process.and this happens in the year 1999.The stunning visuals show about space life like zero gravity toilet,pen flying away due to lack of gravity,food styles in space life,how people walk in space.The visual showing the space crafts,costumes,visual effects,set decoration were amazing and it made me feel that i am in space travel,especially the classic composition background score made me connect with visual with lot of joy.The importance of background score is understood through this movie.Such a great impact it had. The story now starts as an American scientist is on mission to moon, where through discussions with his friends and conference speech,we understand there is a mysterious monolith been planted on moon by E.T,millions of years ago.The substance it is made of remains mystery and the radiation it generates are extremely powerful.There is sense of mystery built on story about monolith through background score also.After that we see scientists go the place of monolith to research and as they try to take a photo,we hear a mysterious sound and scene cuts of to Jupiter mission chapter,which happen after 18 months.In this chapter,through visuals we see the space craft for Jupiter mission,which has 5 scientists.where three of them are in hibernation(in sleeping state with protection) to conserve energy for space mission.Through TV interview,we come to know that they are accompanied by HAL9000 computer(A.I),which controls the overall mission and it is an extremely efficient A.I,that thinks like human.There is a a question been raised about its emotion also.Suddenly the A.I questions about the picking of some scientists in last minute has some mystery of mission.Further it detects problem with AE35 unit in space ship,as a result one of the scientist decide to replace it.But from the space team of earth,who have the HAL9000 twin detects that information given by HALL9000 in space ship is wrong.HAL9000 gets confused after replacing the AE 35 unit and says the scientists to wait and let it fail to fix the problem,as they can afford to be out of communication from earth for sometime.Both scientist discuss on this crisis secretly getting away from HAL9000 and decide it to disconnect it.But HAL reads the lip movement and finds out that they are going to disconnect it.Now one of the scientist leaves the space ship through EVA pod and replace the original AE35 unit,but HAL kills the scientist who went to replace and also kills three of them who were in hibernation.Now the other scientist leaves space ship through EVA pod to survive the one who is flying in space.After surviving him he returns to space ship,but HAL refuses to open the door.And he uses emergency air lock and disconnects HAL,after which he gets message through TV that real mission is to find the mystery of monolith in moon,which causes radiations in Jupiter.Now,we come to the final chapter,Jupiter mission and infinity,where we see earth,Jupiter and monolith aligns in the space and the scientist travel through time and space through monolith and finally reaches a 4d room,where he ages and dies.Finally he becomes a embryo in the death bed.Now we see the monolith in front of bed generating light,energy and he becomes star child.This film is path breaking in all aspects,but there is one side of audience and critics blaming it to be dull,uninteresting, and slow.Only if you love to travel space with sense of adventure and having the passion explore the mystery of universe,you will be enjoying .Otherwise,it's going to be a nightmare.Stanley Kubrick has given new dimension to film making and it's scope.The movie is evident that he is put a great deal of thought and hard work,for which we must appreciate.
