Females who wanna see a woman kick a guy's ass, after he tortures here implausibly throughout the the whole f*****g flick?Oh s**t, I answered my own question.I was screaming the title out at the screen less than halfway through. And not in a good way. This movie represents cinematic s**t in it's purest form. This movie does not have viewers, only survivors.It's a stupid movie for stupid people. Very stupid. People who wouldn't be able to count to 10 if they didn't have that many fingers. For this movie to be worth watching, it should have been as short as it's trailer. J-Lo takes ten steps back.I mean, even Gigli was better than this crap. The movie is like watery broth with a single piece of meat floating in it... like a loan survivor lost at sea with no hope. To watch this putrid filth (or to at least enjoy it), you must love J-Lo (and I mean to the point where you'll gobble up anything she so much as peed on), you must be easily duped, preferably a woman... no, a young teenage girl who gets moist at the sight of watching a woman kick a guy's *ss... There are a lot of women out there like that... watching some chick kick a guy in the nuts. They'll see it and squeal, Right on, sister!You know what? To save you the trouble, here, let me just tell you the entire plot. Like the villain when everything has fallen in his favor They fall in love (he pulls something of a con), they get married.

Movie's over.Not soon ENOUGH, though.I know that the women out there looking for a positive female influence. A leader. Someone they can look up to. But to deal with themes like stalking and spousal abuse so routine... he tortures her to no end... just so she can beat the s**t out of him in the last couple minutes... I felt not so much sympathy for J-Lo's character Slim (by the way, it's J-Lo, so WHY would she honestly be named that??) as much as I felt hate for J-Lo herself and the rest of the filmmakers.

I think that's the reason why this movie is just special to me. But still I watch this movie and honestly it's not as bad as most people exaggerate it to be, granted it's not Citizen Kane, but it's still awesome to watch. I think people take the movie too seriously, first off look at the title, if you're expecting a duck to deliver an Oscar worth performance, get your head checked, second people make fun of the flirting between the duck and Lea Thompson, which was meant to be a joke, not real. Third, the ending, people make fun of it and it's being over the top, I personally found it to be so funny and still a ton of fun to watch, how could you not get a kick out of Jeffrey Jones' performance? He was awesome! If you wanna know what the movie is about, read on before you see the movie so you can get a good idea and judge for yourself.The film begins late at night in Duckworld, which is a version of planet Earth, but with talking ducks living there in place of human beings. As Howard tries to relax, his armchair begins to vibrate violently, and Howard and the chair are promptly yanked through outer-space, all the way to Cleveland on planet Earth. After ending up in an oil drum, Howard hears a fight involving a woman and two thugs pretending to be her fans. Howard uses his skills of Quack Fu to defend her. Intimidated by a talking duck, the thugs scamper. The woman, Beverly, thanks Howard and, feeling sorry for him because he has no warm and dry place to sleep, invites him to her apartment. The next day, Beverly takes Howard to see Phil Blumburtt , who she believes is a scientist that can help Howard get back to Duckworld. It turns out Phil is actually a janitor at a museum and Howard, infuriated with Phil's charade. A few days later, Dr. Walter Jenning , and Larry who explain to Howard that they were doing a routine procedure at the lab, only for the experiment to go out of control, causing the laser to hit Howard's planet instead. Howard suggests he can be sent back to Duckworld if the laser can be put into reverse. He is taken to the Dynatechnics lab alongside Beverly, only to find out on arrival that the laser is seriously damaged due to another explosion. The explosion brings down a Dark Overlord who is not seen by the audience at the time, and takes over Jenning's body. Howard and Beverly see Dr. Jenning, but he is in the process of being taken over by the Dark Overlord. With Howard and Beverly both unaware of this, they escape in Jenning's car onto the freeway with him driving dangerously due to his worsening possession. They stop outside a diner just before he is fully taken over. Inside the Diner, the Overlord explains his attempts to call forth his fellow aliens from the Nexus of Sominus so that they may take over the world.Honestly, yeah the plot is a bit much to grasp, but cut the movie some slack, it's about a duck for goodness' sake! For me, it still makes me laugh and I have a ton of fun watching it. I loved seeing Tim Robbins and Howard trying to get to the factory to destroy Jeffrey Jones before he could take over the world, Tim was absolutely hilarious! Yes there are a few things about this movie that are over the top but I still think that this movie is just mindless entertainment. Hey how many movies do we have where a duck saves Planet Earth? Hmm, I guess this is the only one; but give the movie a fair chance, it's a cute one.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 February 2004","score":"97 out of 148 people found the following review useful","review":" Howard the Duck is a film that I grew up with, I was only a 1 year old when it was released, but my mom and I would watch it together all the time.

I loved seeing Tim Robbins and Howard trying to get to the factory to destroy Jeffrey Jones before he could take over the world, Tim was absolutely hilarious! Yes there are a few things about this movie that are over the top but I still think that this movie is just mindless entertainment. Hey how many movies do we have where a duck saves Planet Earth?

I think that's the reason why this movie is just special to me. But still I watch this movie and honestly it's not as bad as most people exaggerate it to be, granted it's not Citizen Kane, but it's still awesome to watch. I think people take the movie too seriously, first off look at the title, if you're expecting a duck to deliver an Oscar worth performance, get your head checked, second people make fun of the flirting between the duck and Lea Thompson, which was meant to be a joke, not real. Third, the ending, people make fun of it and it's being over the top, I personally found it to be so funny and still a ton of fun to watch, how could you not get a kick out of Jeffrey Jones' performance? He was awesome! If you wanna know what the movie is about, read on before you see the movie so you can get a good idea and judge for yourself.The film begins late at night in Duckworld, which is a version of planet Earth, but with talking ducks living there in place of human beings. As Howard tries to relax, his armchair begins to vibrate violently, and Howard and the chair are promptly yanked through outer-space, all the way to Cleveland on planet Earth. After ending up in an oil drum, Howard hears a fight involving a woman and two thugs pretending to be her fans. Howard uses his skills of Quack Fu to defend her.

(The audience members should all take MMPIs and be sure to leave their limbic systems to science.)This isn't quite like that. I won't bother repeating the story. The movie does have two scenes of violence and blood, and both of them are unexpected and shocking, but there's more to it than that. The characters are more complex than the usual dull teens who tease each other about zits and have their brassieres cut off by flailing hatchets, possibly because the principals are adults. One is Shelly Hack, who is pretty but doesn't need to act. The other adult is Terry O'Quinn without whose performance this movie wouldn't be what is is. He's a real estate salesman who adores healthy families. That bland and putrid smile fits both attributes. He makes cracks too, at times of violence, but they're ironic as well as stupid. He bashes some nosey parker to death and before pushing him off a cliff in one of those cars that always explodes, he fastens the body's seat belt, advising it, Buckle up for safety. After murdering another guy who has surprised him at home, O'Quinn stands over the body and says, Next time call before dropping over, Jim. O'Quinn has two modalities of expression -- 95 percent tepid bourgeois and 5 percent enraged grizzly bear. He's always happiest when saying grace before Thanksgiving dinner, or hugging his wife and daughter so the neighbors can take pictures of them grinning together. But the bear is always there, rumbling and crashing about through the inner brush, and there are times when O'Quinn (Jerry Blake, could anyone pick a better name?) needs to let off a little steam and goes down to the basement workshop and starts growling loudy to himself about how we need a little order around here! He paces back and forth, occasionally loosing a volley of curses and smashing tools around.I don't want to make too much of this, but that basement is his room. It's where he builds an elaborate birdhouse which he sets up in the front yard. He stares admiringly up at the wretched thing and remarks how it sure will be nice to get a bird family in there. (He's already got his birds in a much bigger house.) I liked the idea of that birdhouse, sawed down at the end. I also appreciate the fact that the writer didn't bother to give O'Quinn any buried motive for his serial lives. We learn nothing of his past, and that's just as well, because any attempt at an explanation would cheapen the story.His daughter, Jill Schoelen, however, escapes O'Quinn's clutches, at least for a time, in the attic. (The attic is her sanctuary, see.) This is at the climax of the movie when it has already deteriorated thoroughly into a routine slasher scene. O'Quinn has already socked Hack and knocked her unconscious down the stares and now begins to stalk Schoelen, bloody knife in hand. Schoelen is a pretty, innocent, teenage girl who is nude and is taking a shower. All helpless female victims take showers and hide in dark rooms. A chase ensues, in the course of which -- let me count the ways -- O'Quinn gets stabbed through the brachial artery with a big slice of broken mirror, takes two bullets in the back, crashes through the floor down to the hallway beneath, tumbles down a flight of stairs once, or maybe twice, and is finally stabbed in the heart with a butcher knife before expiring with a puzzled look on his face, Rasputin the Mad Monk. The location shooting is evocative. Late Fall in the Pacific Northwest, erythritic trees frame the figures, shrubs are the color of goldenrod or gorse, the street appropriately rain slick and the skies suitably gray, until after O'Quinn is dispatched, when the sun finally breaks out of its prison.I wish the ending hadn't been so weak and ill-thought-out. Cripes, there's even a scene of a would-be rescuer racing his car towards the house, hoping to get there in time to prevent the final slaughter (which he has no idea is imminent). And he experiences the usual interruptions that slow him down -- including a school-crossing guard with a hand-held stop sign who permits a parade of nuns to plod slowly across the intersection while the driver pounds the steering wheel, muttering, Come on, Come ON. (I swear I'm not making that up.)It's O'Quinn's character that makes the movie, though. He has a good scene at a backyard party when someone hands him a newspaper account of a family that was butchered a year earlier (by O'Quinn himself under another identity), asking why the papers should bring all that up again. O'Quinn says, I don't think I ever heard about that, and he reads the item solemnly as if truly fascinated. A guest asks how any man could kill his own family. Without changing expression or looking up, O'Quinn says, Maybe they disappointed him. He plays the scene very well, not even making it clear that he remembers the incident. He could so easily have overplayed it -- the fleeting scowl, the furtive glance at the others -- right out of a high school play, but instead he keeps it straight.

Driven by the same jealousy that plagued him during their affair, Maurice poses as Sarah's husband and hires a private detective to follow her and find out what she's doing.  As his investigators probe Sarah's personal life, Maurice remembers back to his affair.Having seen the 1950's version of this book, I was interested to see a version that didn't have to worry about the heavy censorship of that period. Funnily though, it is not the nudity, passion or sex that adds to this version of the story; rather it is the ability of the film to show the strong feeling and emotion between the characters.  The plot is pretty true to the book and follows the same turns that are ultimately quite touching (even if their reliance on honour and promises to god seem out dated today). The film manages to evoke sympathy, pity and dislike for each of the three main characters - each is a victim here and the film allows us to see that and feel for each of them regardless of the rights and wrongs of their respective situations.It is difficult to describe but the film is very much of the period; it is very reserved and honourable considering the material, but yet it is deeply emotional and involving.  The only sticking point is the plot's reliance on Sarah's prayer; as I said, it seems difficult to accept in this age that this would have been held to - ironically the 50's version was more acceptable for some reason; maybe because I saw them having sex in this film, maybe then I found it harder to accept a `sinner's prayer' as it were. Besides this, it still does work well and is quite tragic as a love story - this is not a romantic date movie sort of thing!The main reason I was able to buy into the heart of the emotion was the performances.  Fiennes is so perfectly English in the role; he is restrained yet bursting with emotion.  He does a wonderful job of having his character eat away at himself with jealousy without ever seeming pathetic. Conversely Rea does a good job of making his character pathetic but still very much keeping the sympathy of the audience.  The fact that I get to see Moore in the buff (again!) is not a boost to this film, however her performance is. She is good in the role (better and freer than the 50's actress) even if I didn't feel she was as good as Rea and Fiennes - maybe because her character is less expressive and, simply, a `good' person I can only assume Greene was unable to look down on his lover even after the end of the affair.Overall this film has a few sticking points but it is a wonderful version of Greene's book of the same name.  Much was made of the nudity and such, but it is the rawer emotion of this telling that makes it work well.  The script puts them on the screen and the cast do well to bring them out as complex as they are in real life.

Much was made of the nudity and such, but it is the rawer emotion of this telling that makes it work well.  The script puts them on the screen and the cast do well to bring them out as complex as they are in real life.

Driven by the same jealousy that plagued him during their affair, Maurice poses as Sarah's husband and hires a private detective to follow her and find out what she's doing.  As his investigators probe Sarah's personal life, Maurice remembers back to his affair.Having seen the 1950's version of this book, I was interested to see a version that didn't have to worry about the heavy censorship of that period. Funnily though, it is not the nudity, passion or sex that adds to this version of the story; rather it is the ability of the film to show the strong feeling and emotion between the characters.  The plot is pretty true to the book and follows the same turns that are ultimately quite touching (even if their reliance on honour and promises to god seem out dated today). The film manages to evoke sympathy, pity and dislike for each of the three main characters - each is a victim here and the film allows us to see that and feel for each of them regardless of the rights and wrongs of their respective situations.It is difficult to describe but the film is very much of the period; it is very reserved and honourable considering the material, but yet it is deeply emotional and involving.  The only sticking point is the plot's reliance on Sarah's prayer; as I said, it seems difficult to accept in this age that this would have been held to - ironically the 50's version was more acceptable for some reason; maybe because I saw them having sex in this film, maybe then I found it harder to accept a `sinner's prayer' as it were. Besides this, it still does work well and is quite tragic as a love story - this is not a romantic date movie sort of thing!The main reason I was able to buy into the heart of the emotion was the performances.  Fiennes is so perfectly English in the role; he is restrained yet bursting with emotion.  He does a wonderful job of having his character eat away at himself with jealousy without ever seeming pathetic. Conversely Rea does a good job of making his character pathetic but still very much keeping the sympathy of the audience.  The fact that I get to see Moore in the buff (again!) is not a boost to this film, however her performance is. She is good in the role (better and freer than the 50's actress) even if I didn't feel she was as good as Rea and Fiennes - maybe because her character is less expressive and, simply, a `good' person I can only assume Greene was unable to look down on his lover even after the end of the affair.Overall this film has a few sticking points but it is a wonderful version of Greene's book of the same name.

This film had all the right elements a good solid plot\/storyline filled with scandal, deceit, horror and MURDER which was all backed up with excellent camera work, cinematography, and good old fashioned directing from the one and only, Alfred Hitchcock.Being a Hitchcock creation, there is much to be expected from the flick and needless to say, the man delivered to the fullest.  Well-choreographed camera movements strongly portrayed the emotion of each character within the shots and captured the audience's attention right from the get-go.  Every shot had life and individuality.  Creative camera angles and close-ups illustrated the characters' movements\/interactions with Swiss precision.  The shadows that were used in the murder scenes were a nice touch.  This gave away the premonition that obviously, something bad was about to happen, but was still very intimidating and spooky and worked well with the classic black and white tinge the film was presented in.The film's soundtrack did more than just add suspense.  The music made the scene a lot more believable and provided a brilliant hook for the viewer to latch onto.  The gut-wrenching stroke of each string given by Herrmann's mini orchestra brought out the obvious emotions in every scene it accompanied whether it was worry, fear, despair, etc.The inner monologues were another nice touch.  If the shots and the soundtrack weren't enough for the audience, Norman and Marion's inner monologues filled in the blanks.  They both showed not only their thoughts, but also, their persona.  It allowed the audience to tap into their minds and really see what was going on inside of them.Of course you can't talk about Psycho, without talking about the legendary shower scene.  Honestly, this reviewer got more than a few hearty laughs in when watching this `horrific' display of violence.  The scene was obviously needed, but could've been a lot more believable.  The sound effects were okay, but the actual knife slashing and the body contact were&#133;dare I say&#133;CHEAP!  This reviewer is fully aware that it was the 1960's, but come on!  Hitchcock was a cinematic genius!  He could've made the scene a little less comical and a lot more horrifying.  But hey, it was good, almost as good as the ending.  Now this reviewer doesn't like to reveal secrets, but would like to say that the ending may not have the same effect to a modern-day audience as it did to a 1960's audience, because inconceivable endings like this one have been duplicated and butchered by following directors over the past 40 years.  Just try to keep in mind that this film is an original masterpiece and maybe, you'll see a hint of Hitchock's creativity and brilliance.All in all, it was an superb film.  This psychological thriller undoubtedly deserves the prestige and positive reviews it has received from countless critics.  It has set the standard for what a good cinematic thriller should be.  Psycho is for anyone who loves a good mystery and\/or overall excellent film.  Do not let the black and white discourage you, instead, embrace it and welcome it.  You'll learn to appreciate it with this film.

I was at my Grandmothers watching TV in a big yellow swivel chair. I can't remember the particular show I was watching but during the commercial break a trailer for The Shining played. I slowly spun around in the chair, put my hands in front of my face and didn't move for about 10 minutes. I was terrified. I remember the music and a scene where a kid is running through what looked like a big tunnel and a crazed man chasing him with an axe. Forget about it, I was traumatized. Now, the other memories I have of that film happened a little later when it was released on video and my older cousin would watch it all the time, I was scared of it for most of my life but as I got older I began to appreciate how hilarious Jack Nicholson is in it, I mean, disturbingly hilarious.The Shining is a film that I can watch over and over again, mainly because of the humour, but there are other aspects of the film that definitely make it a classic, Kubrik's direction for one, his choice in camera angles and music set a very creepy and other worldly tone. I think that the opening tracking shot may be one of my favorites of all time. The art design is incredible and I can't imagine The Overlook, looking any different than Kubrik intended. Now speaking of overlook, I think that Shelly Duvall and Danny Lloyd get shadowed by Nicholson, but they are both incredible here, the focus on Shelly tends to be the way she looks, homely or ugly, but I think that she plays of Jack so perfectly and reflects the complete loss of control of someone that is in the middle of a real nightmare. Danny Lloyd was so good as the kid that I can't think of any other kid doing as good a job on another film, he wasn't an annoyingly cute toe head, he was real, and seemed to carry an old wisdom in his eyes. Anyway.Aside from all that, this film belongs to Jack and for my money he can do no wrong, I don't care if it comes out that he is a coke snorting jerk off I will always love the guy. Whenever I hear someone utter these words As Soon As Possible I think of Jack. It actually happened a couple of weeks ago, someone said it and I replied as Jack in the Shining Asss Sooon Asss Posseeebbullll they didn't get it.

Then I saw it again last night and I now hate it even more.So I tried to think of the absolute wackiest idea for a review, and I came up with thisA Conversation with the Shark from JAWS (1975).Not many people know this, but those sharks from the JAWS movies weren't real. Oh, no, they were actually animatronic machines--so when that Great White stood up on its tail in Jaws the Revenge, it wasn't real--it was a machine. Who would have guessed it? From such authentic realism, the first thing I said after watching that movie was, How'd they get the shark to do that?Yes, I was too foolish to realize that the animatronic puppet from JAWS was fake. I thought it was real. So, despite all my friends trying to persuade me from doing so, I laboriously researched hours on end, pouring over encyclopedias and the Internet, searching for ways to train a Great White Shark to stand on its dorsal fin and crash its stomach into a boat. Alas, there were no reasonable results--the closest I came to figuring out how they did it was this quote from Steven Spielberg I had nothing to do with this movie. Leave me alone.This led me into the dangerous underworld of stalking--first I stalked the director, then the writers and producers, then the chairman of Universal and all people that worked within fifty miles of the filming for Jaws the Revenge (I was only slapped with fifteen restraining orders!). My answers will still...uh...unanswered.And I was still haunted by the terrifying climactic showdown between Ellen Brody and the shark. I knew that my mind would not be clear unless I went straight to the person responsible for the stunt the shark himself. (This is when I found out for the first time that an animatronic puppet did it, and I cursed the world for tricking me once again. I raised my fist high into the air and shouted, It was fake! Curse them for making me believe otherwise!)But one of these sharks from the original JAWS was indeed a real fish, used in some underwater shots during the movie, particularly that of the Great White attacking Hooper's cage and various other faraway shots. I got to have a brief chat with this shark as part of his promotion for his new movie, Free Willy Goes to Hell The Final Willy, in which Gordo the Shark makes a brief cameo appearance during a scene where Free Willy and his new friend are eaten alive by a pack of hungry sharks.I was immediately taken aback by Gordo the Shark's giant size. He could barely fit in his water tank from where I sat fifty yards away with a jumbo-sized microphone equivalent to those giant Slurpee cups you get at 7-11. After the preliminary introductions we got straight to the point (note I had to interpret most of the clicking and clacking noises he made in response to my questions, but I translated as best as I could, and I honestly believe that this is what he said)JU How have you found your career so far?G Moonbesck.(I interpret this as shark talk for, Very good.)JU How was it working with Steven Spielberg on JAWS?G Moonbesck.(I interpret this as, He was an egotistical maniac.)JU What did you think of Renny Harlin's major knock-off, Deep Blue Sea?G Moonbesck. (I interpret this as, It sucked big time.)At this point in the interview, Gordo the Shark attempted to break free from his containment and devour the entire studio where the interview was being conducted. I managed to escape unscathed with only a few missing limbs.With blood pouring everywhere and major veins torn open, I decided to use the remaining moments of my life to write a review of Deep Blue Sea, one of the worst shark attack films of all time--perhaps even worse than Shark Attack itself (but that's pushing it). Forget the stupid stereotypical characters, exceedingly ridiculous dialogue, dumb ideas and idiotic in-joke references to Renny's other films (how many references to Die Hard 2 did I count? I wish I had written down all of them), this film just doesn't stay afloat. It's a big, boring B-movie with a large budget that still manages to have some of the worst special effects of all time. This stuff was done eight years prior in Terminator 2 Judgment Day.Take Gordo's advice and skip this one. It ain't too deep.

Forget the stupid stereotypical characters, exceedingly ridiculous dialogue, dumb ideas and idiotic in-joke references to Renny's other films (how many references to Die Hard 2 did I count? I wish I had written down all of them), this film just doesn't stay afloat. It's a big, boring B-movie with a large budget that still manages to have some of the worst special effects of all time.

Then I saw it again last night and I now hate it even more.So I tried to think of the absolute wackiest idea for a review, and I came up with thisA Conversation with the Shark from JAWS (1975).Not many people know this, but those sharks from the JAWS movies weren't real. Oh, no, they were actually animatronic machines--so when that Great White stood up on its tail in Jaws the Revenge, it wasn't real--it was a machine. Who would have guessed it? From such authentic realism, the first thing I said after watching that movie was, How'd they get the shark to do that?Yes, I was too foolish to realize that the animatronic puppet from JAWS was fake. I thought it was real. So, despite all my friends trying to persuade me from doing so, I laboriously researched hours on end, pouring over encyclopedias and the Internet, searching for ways to train a Great White Shark to stand on its dorsal fin and crash its stomach into a boat. Alas, there were no reasonable results--the closest I came to figuring out how they did it was this quote from Steven Spielberg I had nothing to do with this movie.

Psycho wasn't exactly a horrifying experience, however for its time is was quit a spooky film. The techniques used for lighting, camera angle, and music are absolutely phenomenal and very powerful.\tFor example&#133; in one scene of this film, the main character is driving her car and the camera is angled at her face head on. The lighting outside of the car is gloomy and somewhat dark, and the music was extremely intense. The entire mood and atmosphere of this scene made everyone migrate to the edge of their seat, and their knuckles white from gripping their arm rests.\tAlso very powerful, and wise, was the symbolism that Hitchcock used throughout this film. For example&#133; in the beginning we see the main character sleeping with a man in her hotel room. She is clothes with a white skirt, and a white bra. A few scenes later, after she has commited a robbery, she is back in her hotel room wearing a black skirt and a black bra. The fact that she has just commited a sin, and is now dressed in black, is a great example of powerful symolism. \tThe camera work was most definetly phenomenal. Part of the movie takes place in or at a hotel complex, and the house that the owner lives out is at the top of a little hill right behind the hotel. The house looks incredibly frightening but the angle that the camera shoots at makes it even more scary, and definetly gives you the chills. \tI do not wish to get into any more detail regarding this film, because I don't want to spoil it for the viewer. However, I would definitely suggest watching psycho. I have yet to hear of anyone who is not satisfied with this film, and I doubt that I ever will. I rate this movie at a 10 for being 100% extraordinary!!! I suggest it to anyone wanting a good spook, or even just someone who enjoys watching brilliant writing put into motion and displayed through this wonderful and enjoyable movie!

Alfred Hitchcock was very smart and creative about the techniques that he used which is why they have become a major part in filmmaking today.The movie starts out with Marion (Janet Leigh) and her boyfriend Sam (John Gavin) in a hotel room.  She wants to marry Sam, but neither of them have the money, especially Sam; he had to give most of his money away in alimony.  When Marion goes to work, her boss asks her to deposit $40,000.  Knowing that she could start a new life with the large sum of money, Marion takes off with it and the suspense begins. While she is driving down the road, the camera zooms in very close to her face, making it awkward for the audience and the screen seems to get tighter and tighter and with the terrifying music playing it has you on the edge of your seat.  Not all of the techniques that Hitchcock uses are technical; a lot of what makes this such a great movie is all the twists in the storyline.  When Marion arrives at the hotel she is staying at there is a huge mansion in the background that appears to be very spooky.  The camera shoots up at it making the viewer feel very small and intimidated.  The shadows that are seen behind the curtains were a great effect and added to the spookiness of the movie.  I thought that the music was one of the best techniques. A movie isn't scary unless it has the right music.  I'm sure the audience could tell that he must have been a perfectionist; there was so much effort put in to this movie beyond what most would expect.   There is so much to discuss about this movie, especially the end, but I don't want to give it away.  I would rate Psycho 10\/10.  It was truly a classic in it's time as well as it is today.

I was surprised to discover that this film wasn't too successful, because I believe Innerspace is good solid entertainment, albeit daft.The story begins when Lt Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid), an excellent pilot but an irresponsible hard drinker volunteers for a highly unusual experiment. He will be placed inside a submersible pod, and with the use of two microchips, be miniaturised and injected into a laboratory rabbit (called Bugs, what is it about Joe Dante and Looney Tunes characters anyway?).But just after Tuck has been shrunk, a group of Silicon Valley industrial spies break into the lab, and steal one of the microchips necessary to reverse the miniaturisation process. In desperation, one of the scientists (Ozzie) runs with the syringe Tuck is in, and injects him into the body of Jack Putter (Martin Short).Jack is a stressed out hypochondriac who is terrified of life, and learning that a shrunken human being is inside his body doesn't make him any less neurotic. With Tuck and Jack now having to depend on each other for survival, they team up with Tuck's ex girlfriend Lydia Maxwell (Meg Ryan) to recover the stolen chip before Tuck's air supply runs out.I must confess to being a sucker for these loser comes out on top stories, and this film is no exception. Jack is a man who has nothing going for him in life, but with Tuck urging him on, Jack manages to find inner confidence he never knew he had and takes control of his life.Both Tuck and Jack's characters go through changes in this film. Seeing the world through Jack's eyes, Tuck begins to reflect upon the mistakes he has made in his life. His irresponsible behaviour and heavy drinking was responsible for Lydia breaking up with him, and he wouldn't be in the situation he's in now if he hadn't recklessly gone through with this hare brained experiment.Dennis Quaid makes a likable character as Tuck, because although he is a wise guy, his pep talks to Jack are quite inspiring and how you can learn to take control of your own destiny.Martin Short is also a likable hero as Jack, although he does have a tendency to go over the top. Although he is supposed to be neurotic, his antics can grate on you a little on occasion. Some of his antics can be funny too, such as the crazy dance he does in Tuck's apartment, and yelling I'm possessed when he first hears Tuck's voice inside his head.The different scrapes they get into are quite exciting, such as Jack's hanging on for dear life at the back of a refrigerated truck (although it is a little overlong). Tuck's battle with one of the spies inside Jack's body is very well done, and the method of killing him is quite innovative too.One of the funniest scenes is when Tuck alters Jack's face to look like The Cowboy (Robert Picardo), someone who has come to buy the microchip off Scrimshaw (Kevin McCarthy), the man responsible for stealing the chip in the first place. The special FX for these scenes are pretty amazing, and the look on everyone's faces during these transformations are priceless.The FX used for inside Jack's body are incredible, and are totally realistic. One of the best scenes is when Tuck is nearly pulled into Jack's heart, and is very nail biting. Another good scene is when Tuck ends up in Lydia's body through a kiss with Jack, and sees his unborn child in her womb. That is a very awe inspiring scene, and is worthy of the same fascination that made Fantastic Voyage great.I believe this is a criminally underrated film. Admittedly, its a hard film to swallow, with things like altering Jack's face to look like someone else. How exactly could you do that? But this is a Joe Dante film, so you have to suspend disbelief a little. Meg Ryan isn't given enough to do, and its a pity her character couldn't have been given enough development.There are also a lot of things happening in this film, and not everything is tied up like it should have been. The way Innerspace ends, there could have been a sequel, but so far it hasn't been followed up. With Dennis Quaid's and Meg Ryan's divorce that doesn't seem very likely now.Still, Quaid has got a brilliant rapport with Short, and some (if not all) of the important matters are resolved. Its an entertaining film, and you find yourself being pulled along for the ride whether you like it or not. After Gremlins, Innerspace is my favourite Joe Dante film.
