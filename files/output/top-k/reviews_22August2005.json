Pretty standard blaxplotation. Quinn basically plays a racist police named Capt. Mattelli whose about as racist as they come beating up any black person in his path, unfortunately no one in this film gives him an equal amount of beatings.Kotto as Lt. Pope who is working the case with him involving stolen loot of the mafia from a couple of black criminals. Man all the characters in the movie are truly revolting black and white. Mattelli isn't the only racist cop, and in fact he's a hypocrite racist who is taking money from a black mafia kingpin!!!!!

Its not that one or two 'Hitchcockian' elements are missing but almost all are missing. JAMAICA INN is adapted from a Daphne Du Maurier novel and was his last English film. Hitchcock's next film and his first American film would be REBECCA also from a Du Maurier novel. He would later go on to direct another film from a Du Maurier original, THE BIRDS, so there is no incompatibility there. The writers were the usual Hitchcock suspects from his English period. Frequent collaborator Sidney Gilliat and long serving Joan Harrison, later the producer of Hitch's TV show, as well as wife Alma Reville, were credited along with J.B. Priestly who gets an additional dialogue credit.The villain of the piece, Charles Laughton, as the unlikely Sir Humphrey Pengallan, the local magistrate on the Cornish coast, is revealed almost immediately. The hero however is obscured for the first reel. The film is built around Laughton and he chews the scenery most wonderfully. It is essentially his picture, the producer, Erich Pommer, a German refugee and one of the founders of famous UFA studios, was Laughton's house producer. Priestly must have been brought in to goose up Laughton's dialogue. Another factor making this film sort of the anti-Hitchcock is the lack of humor whether provided by the situation or the mixing of classes. Laughton is funny, in a way, though he could have been funnier if he had gone completely over the top. As such there is a bit too much naturalism in Laughton's portrait of a Regency rake straight from the Hellfire Club, gone to seed and off his head with greed, rather like the last panel in a Hogarth series of etchings. While Hitchcock villains could be unspeakably cruel they always had a modicum of wit to go along with it.Think of Otto Kruger in SABOTEUR and most especially James Mason in NORTH BY NORTHWEST issuing the foulest threats is the most cultured and dulcet tones. Laughton never gets this type of exchange going  (from NORTH BY NORTHWEST) Roger Thornhill Apparently the only performance that will satisfy you is when I play dead. Phillip Vandamm Your very next role, and you'll be quite convincing, I assure you.For all his facial gymnastics Laughton is pretty straight forward a villain, with only his position to throw people off the scent, something else the real Hitchcock would have found very amusing.Hitchcock even uses terrible screen clichés without even a special twist or variation on them. Usually Hitchcock will use the audiences expectations to his own advantage. There is the one where some one is about to mention the name of the murderer\/villain-in-chief and just as they are about to speak the name a shot rings out and they fall over dead and mute forever. In this case it doesn't even make sense as everyone knows who the villain is but its used anyway because it is always used in this sort of picture. In Charlie Chan pictures it's usually preceded by Number one or number two son exclaiming Look pop, the lights are flickering and then blam! the stoolie doesn't get to spill the beans after all and we have another twenty minutes of film for sure. Its as if Hitchcock really just doesn't care.There is one moment where the film is lifted into the territory rare and wild that bears the special attentions of Hitchcock. I'm sorry to say that it concerns bondage and sadism. The scene has Laughton first gaging Maureen O'Hara and then tying her hands behind her back. It is so effective not because of its graphic nature but because Laughton tells O'Hara what he is going to do before he does it. With the white silken gage pulled taught in her mouth he drapes a hood over her head so that she begins to look like the Virgin Mary bound and gaged. The photography is particularly Germanic here (Pommer and Hitchcock had made THE PLEASURE GARDEN, his first complete film, together in the silent days) and I was reminded not only of the Virgin, but as a Munch like Virgin with her face frozen in anxiety and also the Good Maria from Metropolis. It is a scene which pops out from the rest of the hectic goings on of the rest of the film.Since its not very good Hitchcock it is rarely shown. Even in this sub genre it is outclassed by Fritz Lang's MOONFLEET or even De Mille's very silly REAP THE WILD WIND. JAMAICA INN was just, as John Ford used to put it, a job of work and Hitch was off to America. Seeing this film made me want to dig out one of my copies of Truffaut's extensive interview with Hitchcock to see what he had to say on the matter. He was usually brief when discussing terrible failures like JAMAICA INN. In sum, it is not a Hitchcock film but a Laughton one.

Classical because *High Noon* literally adheres to Aristotle's recommended unities of narrative, place, and time Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly get married just after 1030 on a Sunday; the showdown concludes just after noon on the same day. The chip on its shoulder is a result of the HUAC hearings, at which screenwriter Carl Foreman proved to be an unfriendly witness. This movie was made by folks in a high dudgeon. Foreman and director Fred Zinnemann lash out at the snitches in Hollywood, comparing them quite explicitly to the cowardly, equivocating, morally relativist citizens of Hadleyville.Fine, but we could have done without the lectures. They really mar this movie, preventing it, in my opinion, from being a masterpiece. Some 20 years after *High Noon* was made, Robert Aldrich's *Ulzana's Raid* -- to cite one brilliant example -- managed to be an allegory of the Vietnam War while keeping its mouth shut at the same time. Or, to view this movie's flaws from another direction, George Stevens' *Shane* (released around the same time, I think) managed to portray the loneliness of heroism without all the fuss. But in *High Noon*, we have to endure lectures from absconding judge Otto Kruger about the fickleness of the Athenian mob circa 400 B.C. Gary Cooper looks unimpressed, thank God.The fine folks of Hadleyville are portrayed as either decent-but-cowardly, or actively anticipating -- for unexplained pecuniary reasons -- newly-freed ex-con Frank Miller's arrival. Ah, the fickle Athenian mob. It's an obnoxious enough message as applied to terrified, snitching actors in Hollywood . . . but I got news for the right-wingers out there who took (brief) solace in *High Noon* a few years ago it's an even less applicable message to those who protested our current Arabian adventure. First, comparing the Hadleyvillains to the Sheehanites presumes that the War on Terror and the War on Iraq are one and the same (the proverbial Professor writes Prove? in red ink in the margin). Second, Bush's irremediable supporters tend to forget that Cooper's cause was just; the Administration's cynical, not to mention illegal, war, isn't.To quote Mercutio, A plague on both your houses! What's so often forgotten about *High Noon* is how excellently executed the movie is, aside from its lecturing tone. DP Floyd Crosby achieves a gritty, documentary brilliance with the black-and-white imagery, eschewing the usual travelogue prettiness of the typical Western for a dusty banality. Even the sky above Hadleyville seems soulless not a cloud in it. (The Fifties-L.A. haze was a considerable help, doubtless.) Editor Elmo Williams deservedly won an Oscar for his precise quick-cutting that jacks up the sands-down-the-hourglass suspense. As for Gary Cooper Marshall Will Kane was his apotheosis as an actor. No other actor of his time could have done this role better. Some have complained that Coop was too old for Grace Kelly, but it's more accurate to say that she was too young. His age conferred a sense of urgency to the part a younger man would have had less to lose, or at least he would have felt that way about it. Another great success in the acting department is earned by then-newcomer Katy Jurado as the fiercely independent, and independently wealthy, Mexican businesswoman, shadow partner of most of the business establishments in town. Her noble portrayal is worthy of the part, which, in the final analysis, is far more daring than the movie's picayune political commentary.Despite its unfortunate flaws, *High Noon* remains a gritty, ahead-of-its-time, downright indie film that holds up well today. 7 stars out of 10.

What's so often forgotten about *High Noon* is how excellently executed the movie is, aside from its lecturing tone. DP Floyd Crosby achieves a gritty, documentary brilliance with the black-and-white imagery, eschewing the usual travelogue prettiness of the typical Western for a dusty banality. Even the sky above Hadleyville seems soulless not a cloud in it. (The Fifties-L.A. haze was a considerable help, doubtless.) Editor Elmo Williams deservedly won an Oscar for his precise quick-cutting that jacks up the sands-down-the-hourglass suspense. As for Gary Cooper Marshall Will Kane was his apotheosis as an actor. No other actor of his time could have done this role better. Some have complained that Coop was too old for Grace Kelly, but it's more accurate to say that she was too young. His age conferred a sense of urgency to the part a younger man would have had less to lose, or at least he would have felt that way about it.

Classical because *High Noon* literally adheres to Aristotle's recommended unities of narrative, place, and time Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly get married just after 1030 on a Sunday; the showdown concludes just after noon on the same day. The chip on its shoulder is a result of the HUAC hearings, at which screenwriter Carl Foreman proved to be an unfriendly witness. This movie was made by folks in a high dudgeon.

As he explains later, this is where he lives and no band of mutates or any other son of a bitch will get him to leave. In this version of history, the world went all to hell about 1975, thanks to biological warfare; the buildings remain but most people are dead - circa 1977, when Heston, as Neville, seemingly rules the empty streets (a half-dozen years in the future to the audiences who originally saw this picture). Neville alternates his time between watching Woodstock in an empty theater, playing chess with a bust of Caesar, and hunting for the 'nest' where the mutated albinos hang out during daytime. His days aren't all that bad; sure he's lonely, but he still has a purpose - wiping out those 'vermin' as he calls them (with good reason; they are quite barbaric). Neville, the last real man, represents modern technology; the mutates (led by Matthias, an ex-newscaster played by Zerbe in a magnetic rendition) have embraced a pre-industrial position, resembling nothing so much as torch-waving witch-hunters from 300 years ago. This sets up a natural conflict, paving the way for some nice action; Heston's character is not one to sit around moping & crying, and he more than obliges 'the family' in battling back against them as they harass him with their braying, their clumsy attacks.When I was a teenager, I would often imagine what it would be like as the sole survivor of a holocaust, in an empty city; this was the film which promoted most of those daydreams. Neville's position as sole man shifts at the midway point, when he's rescued by a couple of other younger survivors (Cash as the last woman and Koslo as Dutch, the last college student). It turns out Neville is the only one truly immune to the bio-attack due to a lucky serum used in the 11th hour on himself. Now he switches from resourceful terminator to mankind's savior, even taking on non-too-subtle Christ connotations. This was to the detriment of the film, which is why it doesn't rate 9 or 10 stars from me. And it comes across as rather quaint and funky nowadays, but back then it seemed pretty radical, with Heston (the MAN as he's called at one point) getting down with a foxy African American chick (most racial problems go out the window when there's not enough people left). For trivia buffs, we all know there are a few scenes (too many) where you can see moving cars in the far distance as Heston drives in the foreground. Getting back to the credits sequence, just after Neville gets a flat tire, you can actually see someone on foot for half-a-second way in the background. But this could be one of the family braving daytime for a few seconds, or even Dutch sneaking around behind Neville's back. I'm also very fond of the musical score, and it's one of those I can't get out of my head on certain days. Based on Richard Matheson's 'I Am Legend' - remade in 2007 with Will Smith.

While George Miller is not remembered nearly as well as Mel Gibson, he is by a long road the better director. With car chase sequences that are equalled by few and surpassed by none, Mad Max 2 clearly shows why. Beginning with a narrative wrap-up (and explanation) of the events in the original film, Mad Max 2 soon shows that things have not improved since then. Things have become steadily worse. As fuel has become steadily more scarce, roving gangs have searched out any fuel source they can. You can see this difficulty when Max is trying to soak up the fuel from a crashed truck. After fighting off one gang of would-be thieves, he finds himself fighting and enslaving a somewhat eccentric helicopter pilot. The real fun begins when said helicopter pilot leads him out to a compound in the middle of the desert, where one small group has mastered refining fuel to the point where they have attracted the attention of some unsavoury types.Max, never one to pass on exploiting a situation to his benefit, watches as the refiners try sending out scouts to find a truck that will haul their big tank of fuel. When one of the scouts is left for dead, Max brings him back to his friends, hoping to trade his life for some fuel. When this scout dies, Max finds himself without a leg to stand on, in the figurative sense, until their leader finds himself arguing with his people about their worsening situation. When he hears about how they need a truck to pull the tank, a light goes on above his head, and he proposes to them that he take some of their fuel back to the tanker he spotted at the beginning of the film, then drive the truck back to them in exchange for all the fuel he can carry in his old interceptor. When they take him up on the offer, he literally smashes his way through the barricade, collects his car, and drives off into the sunset.It sounds like a pretty boring and straightforward plot so far, but wait, there is a lot more. When the bad guys intercept him and run him off the road, he finds himself badly broken. They kill his dog, but then they make the mistake of trying to rip off his fuel, which triggers the bomb set up in earlier chapters. Without his car and his dog, Max is left in the desert to die, until the eccentric helicopter pilot he has previous been so mean to rescues him and takes him back to the refiners' compound. Having a big change of heart, he volunteers to drive the massive tanker. The refiners are skeptical at first, but they divide their force in half, let the attackers go after their tanker, and send most of their non-combatants in the opposite direction. It still sounds very straightforward and non-layered, and it is, but what this amounts to is setup for around half an hour of the best car chases captured on film. The Blues Brothers and Ronin have scenes that compare well, but nothing compares for sheer cost-to-effect ratio.Once this final scene with the truck and more cares than one can shake a stick at gets underway, mayhem ensues. Grapping hooks, crossbows, spears, and any other weapon you can imagine that does not require gunpowder is used. There are even a few shots with weapons that do require gunpowder. Some of the photography is not entirely stable, but this is soon forgotten as most of the shots are composed in a fashion that gives the eye a million things to do. Every shot is dynamic and brilliantly composed. It is little wonder that among cinematographers, one of the least celebrated professions in film-making, Dean Semler is legend. While Mad Max 2 did not set a record for profit like the original, one will never guess that it was made for a mere four million Australian dollars. That it made more than five times its budget in the USA, as an independent release, is certainly a testament to the film's entertainment value. Yes, there is a lot of exposition in search of a massive chase scene, but there is not a single moment in the film where one can rightly claim to be bored.I gave Mad Max 2 a ten out of ten. It is probably the best thing I can ever recommend to car crash junkies, and stands as an excellent example of how one does not need to spend Africa's yearly food budget to make a good film.

Like 'Batman Returns', this is a dark film, but definitely not gloomy. In terms of introducing us to a new series of 'Batman films', Tim Burton does an excellent job of bringing Batman into Gotham City, were no-body knows who or what Batman is. Micheal Keaton does a great job of developing his Batman character from start to finish. His character had to be developed, after-all, no-one in Gotham City knows whether Batman should be trusted or not, and is therefore perceived as being a mysterious character. Keatons overall performance is great, he plays the best Bruce Wayne role out of all the actors that attempted, and his Batman role is solid enough to make sure you would never want to mess with him! He has a brilliant sense of security that makes you feel safe, even when your just watching him in this film. The acting is brilliant as he his able to give both characters a separate personality, each being unique and entertaining.Jack Nicholson also puts in a fantastic performance. I have always loved to watch Nicholson in comedies, and his 'Joker' role suits him down to the ground. After a steady start to the film, you will soon see how he becomes the Joker and just how funny he can be, with his words and props. What you can love about Nicholson in this film is that although he is Batmans main villain, you realise towards the end he is just a joker, and no match for Batman in a fight. Kim Bassinger plays Batmans 'lover' in this film, and does a good job of showing us just how nosey some photographers can be, but Batman makes sure she doesn't get in his way.. too much. Afterall, has their ever been a woman in Bruce Waynes life who has not had a good job, and become attracted to him? The atmosphere in Gotham City is brilliant and sets the scene very well for Batman, as the dark roof tops and roads of the city do far more justice than bright sunshine in hot weather. Tim Burton also used the idea here of a city with no time-scale. In other words, the buildings and dress styles look very 1930's, but the technology is can look futuristic with Batman at times. The quality is in the directing and the acting. It is not a fast paced film, but moves steadily. Their are no un-realistic special effects, but clever props. Many younger viewers may slag off this film, but they will never realise that the quality comes from the story, directing, and acting. Not from modern un-realistic special effects.

Like 'Batman Returns', this is a dark film, but definitely not gloomy. In terms of introducing us to a new series of 'Batman films', Tim Burton does an excellent job of bringing Batman into Gotham City, were no-body knows who or what Batman is. Micheal Keaton does a great job of developing his Batman character from start to finish. His character had to be developed, after-all, no-one in Gotham City knows whether Batman should be trusted or not, and is therefore perceived as being a mysterious character. Keatons overall performance is great, he plays the best Bruce Wayne role out of all the actors that attempted, and his Batman role is solid enough to make sure you would never want to mess with him! He has a brilliant sense of security that makes you feel safe, even when your just watching him in this film. The acting is brilliant as he his able to give both characters a separate personality, each being unique and entertaining.Jack Nicholson also puts in a fantastic performance. I have always loved to watch Nicholson in comedies, and his 'Joker' role suits him down to the ground. After a steady start to the film, you will soon see how he becomes the Joker and just how funny he can be, with his words and props. What you can love about Nicholson in this film is that although he is Batmans main villain, you realise towards the end he is just a joker, and no match for Batman in a fight. Kim Bassinger plays Batmans 'lover' in this film, and does a good job of showing us just how nosey some photographers can be, but Batman makes sure she doesn't get in his way.. too much.

This is not what we were formerly told. This is how the English poet Edmund Blunden addressed the philosophical question of why bad things happen to good people (and vice versa). Crimes and Misdemeanors represents Woody Allen's attempt to tackle the same issue. Like this year's Melinda and Melinda it combines humorous and serious stories, but is a far better work. Melinda and Melinda suffers because its related plot lines are artificially forced into the trite and over-schematic framework of a debate over dinner between two playwrights as to whether life is comic or tragic. Moreover, the supposedly tragic story seemed insufficiently serious to merit that description. Crimes and Misdemeanors has two plot lines; one, which may be thought of as Crimes tragic, the other, which may be thought of as Misdemeanors, tragi-comic. The first concerns Judah Rosenthal, a successful New York ophthalmologist. Judah (brilliantly played by Martin Landau) is well-respected and regarded as a pillar of the community, but his private life is a mess. Unknown to his wife and family, Judah has been having an affair with Dolores, an air hostess. Dolores wants him to leave his wife for her; when he refuses to do so, Dolores threatens not only to inform his wife but also to reveal certain financial irregularities in his practice which could ruin his reputation. In order to silence Dolores, Judah turns to his brother Jack, a gangster with underworld connections, who offers to have her murdered. The other plot line concerns Clifford Stern, an idealistic but unsuccessful director of documentary films. Clifford is offered the job of directing the filmed biography of his own brother-in-law Lester, a successful producer. Under pressure from his wife, Clifford accepts, but only reluctantly as he despises the shallow, conceited and Philistine Lester. Clifford's own marriage is in trouble and during the making of the film he meets, and begins an affair with, Halley, Lester's assistant. Halley shares Clifford's idealism and they plan to make a documentary about Louis Levy, a philosopher whose work Clifford admires. This is one of Woody's darkest films, both physically and morally. Most of the action takes place in darkened interiors, and the predominant tones- browns, greys and dull yellows and oranges- are sombre. Morally, the film seems (at least at first sight) to reflect a world in which evil triumphs over good. Judah, after agreeing to Jack's suggestion that they should have Dolores murdered, is initially plagued by feelings of guilt, but as time passes and he realises that the police do not suspect him of involvement in the crime, these feelings fade away and he resumes his old life. Louis Levy commits suicide, which causes Clifford to doubt the optimistic, life-affirming philosophy he had taught. On a less serious level, Clifford is sacked from his job by the odious Lester, who even manages to seduce Halley away from him. The mood is lightened by occasional touches of characteristic Allen humour, mostly from Woody himself as Clifford, but much of this is of a dark, cynical nature, more so even than in most of his movies. (I don't know from suicide, y'know. Where I grew up in Brooklyn we were too unhappy to commit suicide.) Yet the film is not, in my view, dominated by pessimism to the utter exclusion of all else. It is that rare thing, a Woody Allen film that takes a positive view of religion. Elsewhere, his attitude has generally been one of religious scepticism, such as in Hannah and Her Sisters where Woody's character, suffering from a crisis of existential angst, adopts several religions only to reject them all in favour of a live for today philosophy. Here, however, religious and secular views of life are contrasted, and not always to the detriment of the former. Woody has often used his Jewishness for comic effect; here he raises some more serious points about Jewish identity, as the religion-versus-secularism debate takes place in the context of Judaism rather than Christianity. Judah was brought up as an Orthodox Jew, but has rejected his religious faith in favour of a bleak, nihilistic world-view, unable to accept his father's idea that the eyes of God see everything. (Images of the eye and of sight are important in this film). Some of the most important scenes in the film are the conversations between Judah and one of his patients, a Rabbi named Ben. Although Ben (another very good performance from Sam Waterstone) is slowly losing his sight, his religious faith enables him to bear the prospect of blindness with stoicism and he never loses his belief in a higher power or in an essential moral order in the universe. He may lose his sight in a physical sense, but in a moral sense he can see more clearly than any other character in the film. This is not a religious film in the sense that, say, The Passion of the Christ is a religious film. Woody is always too much of a pessimist ever to echo Blunden's conclusion that Over there are faith, love, virtue in the sun. Nevertheless, it is a film which (like two other great Woody films of the late eighties, Hannah and The Purple Rose of Cairo) discusses themes of philosophical and theological import and one that acknowledges the power of faith in peoples' lives. What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul? It is those who have succeeded in worldly terms, Judah and Lester, who have, metaphorically if not literally, lost their souls, whereas Ben and Clifford, less blessed by worldly success, have retained their integrity. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 August 2005","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I have been young, and now am not too old; And I have seen the righteous forsaken, His health, his honour and his quality taken.

Elsewhere, his attitude has generally been one of religious scepticism, such as in Hannah and Her Sisters where Woody's character, suffering from a crisis of existential angst, adopts several religions only to reject them all in favour of a live for today philosophy. Here, however, religious and secular views of life are contrasted, and not always to the detriment of the former. Woody has often used his Jewishness for comic effect; here he raises some more serious points about Jewish identity, as the religion-versus-secularism debate takes place in the context of Judaism rather than Christianity. Judah was brought up as an Orthodox Jew, but has rejected his religious faith in favour of a bleak, nihilistic world-view, unable to accept his father's idea that the eyes of God see everything. (Images of the eye and of sight are important in this film). Some of the most important scenes in the film are the conversations between Judah and one of his patients, a Rabbi named Ben. Although Ben (another very good performance from Sam Waterstone) is slowly losing his sight, his religious faith enables him to bear the prospect of blindness with stoicism and he never loses his belief in a higher power or in an essential moral order in the universe. He may lose his sight in a physical sense, but in a moral sense he can see more clearly than any other character in the film. This is not a religious film in the sense that, say, The Passion of the Christ is a religious film. Woody is always too much of a pessimist ever to echo Blunden's conclusion that Over there are faith, love, virtue in the sun. Nevertheless, it is a film which (like two other great Woody films of the late eighties, Hannah and The Purple Rose of Cairo) discusses themes of philosophical and theological import and one that acknowledges the power of faith in peoples' lives. What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul? It is those who have succeeded in worldly terms, Judah and Lester, who have, metaphorically if not literally, lost their souls, whereas Ben and Clifford, less blessed by worldly success, have retained their integrity. 9\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"}]
