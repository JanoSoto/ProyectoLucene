I think that it was a great movie. It was funny when it had to be, but it was also somber. It wasn't a death or never-again kind of somber, but a maybe-if kind of somber.It was just that Holden still had some things to realize about himself. Even though at the convention he hadn't found them yet, he was telling Banky and Alyssa that he wasn't very far off. If you listen to and watch the ending close enough, it's obvious that Holden hadn't talked to either of them in that year-long span. And I think that Smith was wanting the audience to do a little soul-searching of their own after this movie.I'll admit, Holden talking about the three of them having sex together did seem a little out of character, but Adams' character brought the film back to the overall emotional tone of the second half of the film.Overall, it was one of Smith's best works, if not the best. It was classic Jay-and-Silent-Bob-funny in the beginning and unknowingly worked its way into this romantic-drama film that really captured the emotional relationship to its depths. He showed this same scheme of the emotional relationship in Clerks, but it was lost in between all the calamity and hilarity. Plus, you didn't get the background of the relationship. In Chasing Amy, he just let it be its own separate entity. I think that this movie will go down as one of the forgotten greats that will be overshadowed by the idiotic hilarity of Mallrats or Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and from what I've seen maybe even Clerks II.

All the employees quickly die. Then we are introduced to a young woman (Milla Jovovich) with amnesia who is somehow connected to the facility. Suddenly a young man bursts into her home, followed by commandos who are there to exterminate the employees who are now flesh-eating zombies. I found the film to be exciting, scary and well made. Jovovich is very good in the role of Alice, who discovers she has fighting skills that come in handy when battling the undead. (I love the scene where she climbs the wall and kicks the zombie dog in the head!) Be sure to pay attention to all the Alice in Wonderland references. The audio commentary from the cast and crew on the DVD is entertaining. Jovovich points out all of her nude scenes. She also mentions that the American distributor wanted to change the voice of the little girl (Michaela Dicker) who plays the Red Queen, but the American girl's voice was too sexy for a little girl!

I suppose I do have a biased opinion of the movie, as Quentin Tarantino was on my list of favorite directors from having seen his other movies (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Jackie Brown) but I also have legitimate reasons to have absolutely adored this one.There are seven main characters in all; Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), Eddie Nice Guy (the late Chris Penn) and finally, Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney).So here's the main summary Joe, the boss, has assembled all the other main characters to steal a bag of diamonds for him. He assigns them color-coded aliases to hide their identities from being known even to each other, just to avoid any slip-of-the-tongues with cops or maybe even a rat in the group. But something in their plan to steal the diamonds went very wrong. One by one, the surviving men find their way back to their warehouse hideout, which is where almost the entire movie takes place. There, they try to find the traitor among them who tipped off the police and chaos strikes. There's a lot of blood, sudden outbursts, confrontations, disloyalty, unexpected fights and a lot of dark humor during this time. In all, it is a violent movie with clever and funny dialog, and with a great Sounds Of 'Seventies soundtrack. The ending is also unexpectedly moving (well, I haven't really given anything away!). No one could ever get bored during this movie (or any other Tarantino movie for that matter) because the dialog is just so perfectly conversational and spot-on. I know that I said this before, but I had to say it again. The witty and realistic conversation in the first scene in which Tarantino's character, Mr. Brown, dissects Madonna's Like a Virgin is simply hilarious. You'll find yourself laughing smugly during the entire movie.Also, every single one of the actors portrayed their characters extremely well. Harvey Keitel really proved himself an amazing actor to me in this movie. I was never much of a fan of his until I'd seen Reservoir Dogs (his role in Taxi Driver wasn't too challenging and in Mean Streets he was just annoying really). His character was compassionate and bad-ass all at once, and both those adjectives are very contradicting so for him to have done the amazing job he did do by playing them at the same time, I would have to cheer loudly for Keitel. Tim Roth was also wonderful and I can't say why without having to give most of the movie away. But if you watch it, you'll know what I mean.To be honest, I don't have a single negative thing to say about this movie. (Okay, so seeing an ear being cut off wasn't exactly my cup of tea but that's probably the only criticism.) A definite favorite, and a classic.

This is the best of that duo with a lot of laugh-out loud scenes. There are tons of gags, both obvious and subtle. In fact, I think is one of Martin's funniest performances. Kathleen Turner, his co-star here, played a similar role in another black comedy Serial Mom. There, too, she played a woman who appeared to be nice on the outside but was evil inside.

It can be added to the very long list of films based on books which strip the original of every quality that made it a story worth telling to begin with. It's not only a rotten adaptation, it's a pretty dim excuse for a movie in its own right.Patrick Dennis's novel *Auntie Mame an Irreverent Escapade* is not only hysterically funny, it is also very sweet and touching. But -- and this is what the movie missed -- it never gets drippy or sentimental. In the book, Mame has a lot of good points, but she's also really rather wicked. Her relationship with her nephew is largely based on bribery, blackmail, and deceit, even though they really do love each other. They just express it in unconventional ways.For some reason the film makers decided to portray Gloria as unattractive -- beautiful, but insufferable -- making you wonder why Patrick fell for her to begin with. They also leave out his dalliance with a gold-digging prostitute while in college. I guess including that would have made him look like he had a sleazy side, which wouldn't fit with what the movie was going for.The movie also ends up making very little sense as a narrative, because it greatly compresses the plot, which should take place over the course of over twenty years, down to about nine years. The film begins, as it should, right before the 1929 crash, but since they rush everything else, it ends well before the war, instead of several years after. So Patrick is only about nineteen when he gets together with Pegeen. Plus, he and Pegeen fall for each other right away, instead of hating each other on sight, then grudgingly growing to like each other after a while. Pegeen's frank disapproval of Mame is also left out.Naturally films based on books need to do some streamlining and cutting and leaving out, but that's supposed to make the storyline hold together better, not make it fall utterly to pieces. And in this case, the film makers also cheated themselves and their audience out of the chance to dramatize some of the book's most entertaining plot situations.A complete list of things the film makers changed, left out, or watered down would be far too long for an IMDb review. But to my mind, the movie's chief sin is that all the lovable wickedness, all the depth, all the pathos, and all the personality has been removed from Vera, Pegeen, Brian, Agnes, and especially Mame and Patrick themselves. The political aspects have also been pretty much nixed.A great deal of effort went into sanitizing Mame and making her merely eccentric, rather than immoral. For instance, she doesn't actually have an affair with Brain -- instead, he hits on her and she heroically wards him off. And Brian turns out to have married Agnes when he runs away with her. Please.As for Patrick, they portray him as basically a sweet kid who at one point commits the forgivable transgression of dating a debutante. He's a far cry from the wise, perceptive, fallible, smarmy-yet-urbane narrator of the novel.Over all, this is Patrick Dennis's novel after having been chopped up with an axe and soaked in disinfectant. As other reviewers have noted, the film is dated. The novel, with its sophisticated and irreverent elegance, is timeless.

That's not to say that the film is terrible&#151;it's not&#151;or that you shouldn't watch it&#151;you should&#151;but rather that it has many flaws, some of them glaring.Ask most people why they saw the movie, and they'll say something like It has George Clooney and Brad Pitt in it, or It has Julia Roberts in it, or Stephen Soderbergh directed it. Ocean's Eleven is a People magazine reader's dream come true. So many celebrities in one movie what bliss! The point is that Ocean's Eleven is not meant to be strong on character or plot; it's meant to be strong on Star Power. In fact, it's surprising that there is a plot, such as it is. It follows the new Blockbuster code Hot Bad Guys who are actually Good Guys want to steal money from crooked, mean Big Businessman; they make elaborate plans, use fancy equipment, and ultimately&#133;but we all know the ending. Soderbergh may court the strange, the offbeat, the underbelly of society, but he also knows that when making an action movie one should not deviate too much from the tried-and-true. He gives us what we want, and more.George Clooney and Brad Pitt as Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan, respectively, are the most likable of the bunch. They have a rapport that either is natural, or was rehearsed so effectively and so well that it became natural. They're like Laurel and Hardy, only with stubble and expensive suits. They eat each other's lines, insult each other, show off in front of each other&#151;in some ways they're a more compelling couple than Clooney and Roberts.Incidentally, Julia Roberts, apparently confusing Tess Ocean with Erin Brockovich, gives an intensity to her role of The Chick that is entirely inappropriate. This is an action movie, not a chance to win another Oscar. She delivers lines like she's chopping onions short, quick, and full of force. Of course, her dramatic skill is unquestionable, but in this case a lighter touch would have been more fitting. I can understand her desire, if she had it, of wanting to give more weight to her role as Clooney's ex-wife and Andy Garcia's new girlfriend; it must be frustrating to be a piece of meat that men fight over. But she should have been more perceptive of the movie's genre and its requirements. In action movies, chicks should look hot and be tough; not much more is (usually) required.The fact is, we hardly ever think of Roberts, or any of the other Big Names, as anything but who they are off the set. Although Garcia calls Roberts Tess several times, somehow the name always rings false. The other cast members, being less famous, have the advantage of being able to play their characters more convincingly.This movie was a remake of another all-star movie made in 1960. (I've been unable to see more than snippets, and since I currently live out of the US I'm not able to rent it.) Most reviews refer to this previously made film, but the fact is that Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven is its own entity. We should judge it not based on its predecessor, but on its own merits&#151;unfortunately too few.When I first saw this movie, it was dubbed in Spanish, and I thought it was well made, well acted, and generally better than most action movies. (Of course, I was on a date at the time, so I wasn't scrutinizing every detail.) Upon subsequent viewing, however, this movie's imperfections only become more glaring. It's too bad. Although you won't think you've wasted two hours if you watch it for the first time, this movie is not one that you'll return to over and over again&#151;that kind of film where each time you see it you discover more of the director's ingenuity, or the actors' skill, or the screenwriter's craft.

That's not to say that the film is terrible&#151;it's not&#151;or that you shouldn't watch it&#151;you should&#151;but rather that it has many flaws, some of them glaring.Ask most people why they saw the movie, and they'll say something like It has George Clooney and Brad Pitt in it, or It has Julia Roberts in it, or Stephen Soderbergh directed it. Ocean's Eleven is a People magazine reader's dream come true. So many celebrities in one movie what bliss! The point is that Ocean's Eleven is not meant to be strong on character or plot; it's meant to be strong on Star Power. In fact, it's surprising that there is a plot, such as it is. It follows the new Blockbuster code Hot Bad Guys who are actually Good Guys want to steal money from crooked, mean Big Businessman; they make elaborate plans, use fancy equipment, and ultimately&#133;but we all know the ending. Soderbergh may court the strange, the offbeat, the underbelly of society, but he also knows that when making an action movie one should not deviate too much from the tried-and-true. He gives us what we want, and more.George Clooney and Brad Pitt as Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan, respectively, are the most likable of the bunch. They have a rapport that either is natural, or was rehearsed so effectively and so well that it became natural. They're like Laurel and Hardy, only with stubble and expensive suits. They eat each other's lines, insult each other, show off in front of each other&#151;in some ways they're a more compelling couple than Clooney and Roberts.Incidentally, Julia Roberts, apparently confusing Tess Ocean with Erin Brockovich, gives an intensity to her role of The Chick that is entirely inappropriate. This is an action movie, not a chance to win another Oscar. She delivers lines like she's chopping onions short, quick, and full of force. Of course, her dramatic skill is unquestionable, but in this case a lighter touch would have been more fitting. I can understand her desire, if she had it, of wanting to give more weight to her role as Clooney's ex-wife and Andy Garcia's new girlfriend; it must be frustrating to be a piece of meat that men fight over. But she should have been more perceptive of the movie's genre and its requirements. In action movies, chicks should look hot and be tough; not much more is (usually) required.The fact is, we hardly ever think of Roberts, or any of the other Big Names, as anything but who they are off the set. Although Garcia calls Roberts Tess several times, somehow the name always rings false. The other cast members, being less famous, have the advantage of being able to play their characters more convincingly.This movie was a remake of another all-star movie made in 1960. (I've been unable to see more than snippets, and since I currently live out of the US I'm not able to rent it.) Most reviews refer to this previously made film, but the fact is that Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven is its own entity. We should judge it not based on its predecessor, but on its own merits&#151;unfortunately too few.When I first saw this movie, it was dubbed in Spanish, and I thought it was well made, well acted, and generally better than most action movies. (Of course, I was on a date at the time, so I wasn't scrutinizing every detail.) Upon subsequent viewing, however, this movie's imperfections only become more glaring. It's too bad. Although you won't think you've wasted two hours if you watch it for the first time, this movie is not one that you'll return to over and over again&#151;that kind of film where each time you see it you discover more of the director's ingenuity, or the actors' skill, or the screenwriter's craft. This movie is good for a quick laugh and a thrill, but, like cake, it's not ultimately what will satisfy your hunger.

Speaking as a Brit with a lot of North American life experience, I would say that Ken understands and portrays British society brilliantly, however, he hopelessly misunderstands American society. At one point, for example, one of the evil company bosses is supposed to be excruciatingly shamed in public by the gutsy and imaginative union organiser who crashes his lunch meeting ... only, in America, this simply wouldn't work - at all - in a restaurant like that in the US the other patrons would respect someone for making money & not give a crap what some scrub had to say about the percentage rate of profit that went into x dental plan, or what have you (I'm not really sure that that would work in Britain or anywhere else either - but in any event, it seems to me, never in the US & especially never in LA). As such, all the fabulous nuance that invades Loach's British based films is starkly absent in this one. Consequently, watching Bread and Roses was quite literally an excruciating experience - like watching a childhood hero fail embarrassingly, & without grace. Ken creating wooden characters? How is it possible?? (See above). I don't consider myself political. I am someone interested in ideas, fairness and justice. I respect people who approach the world with those ideas in mind. On this basis I usually have all the time in the world for the films that Ken creates. But realistically, I can't recommend this one. In the end I gave this movie a 5 & a half (then rounded up) but all of its score comes from a particular realistic, powerful and highly revealing moment. There's too much of the remainder left over, however, for that single moment to carry the whole.
