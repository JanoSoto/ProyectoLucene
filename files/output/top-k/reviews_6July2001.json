Talk about pretentious, mechanical drivel (JACOB'S ending will forever be a cheap out, even to the most lame-brained b-movie hack writers who'd have sniffed such a metaphysical cop-out coming for half the movie). But enough about JACOB'S LADDER.LULU is written by a writer, directed by a writer, and features a male character, a directionless Jazz sax player whose life is scum-slathered, gray rest-rooms beneath dungeon-like clubs in NY; one night he sees the photograph of a beautiful woman he does not know taped to a wall while taking a leak. Harvey Keitel is nearly assassinated onstage by a demented shooter in the audience. After that, his entire life changes, he meets the beautiful girl, and he worships her.Here's the thing Keitel WORSHIPS her, this woman, her beauty, the preternatural immenseness. This young woman captures the hard face of Keitel in her hands and is fulfilled by him, a man like him with nothing to equal what she is, not even his music; in fact, his music means nothing, it is merely how he is able to elevate himself out of the thick dirty rest-room so that this woman can see him and (through a transcendental mutual encounter with a glowing rock, about the only way a man like Keitel might have a chance to be with her by pure coincidence) love him for his kindness and total devotion and loyalty.Auster's a novelist; he writes damn fine movies. He's not trying to mimic or reproduce real life. He's a writer who understands the power of a two-dimensional character or situation hit by a 3D meteor from beyond their understanding, and the character's emergence as a human being from that instant of understanding. LULU ON THE BRIDGE is a poignant, believable, and wrenching story of adoration for a woman who seems to drop down like a UFO, all mystery and the unknown (as the connection is made to Louise Brook's dark mistress from PANDORA'S BOX) to abduct Keitel and show him things he'd never know, in his lonely night world. It's pointed out that only once before did the man Keitel plays encounter glowing beauty, and desire it as a child,trying to catch fireflies and put them in a jar, to look at. He was never able to catch his own fireflies, and it is that haunting symbol of loss, that empty jar, that is the grown man who is filled by the beautiful woman from nowhere. And then the jar shatters. A great movie.

That simple. I've had other people's opinions thrown at me, and none have pointed this out. What I find too ridiculous (and depressing) is when I find myself going through those who say the film fails to achieve historical accuracy about Spain's past, and that the film is an insult to Basque national identity. That's just hilarious. The film has nothing to do with Spain's history, or anything like that, it's just a love story, told following a personal poetic style, that's all. Medem is perfectly conscious that the German airplane pilot is a Nazi, as he has one of the parents point out in the background. What he wants to reflect is how the teenage Ana accepts a childlike fantastic reality, and how the process of growing up involves a construction of realities that may not be completely true to physical or social realities, but nevertheless are to emotions.Other people talk about how Medem's telling of the story from different perspectives undermines the ultimate truth. What they fail to see is that this is just poetry, and that poetry sometimes isn't a search for this rational truth you'd look for in something like science. What's more, this film deals with human emotions, which are to my knowledge of the most irrational thing ever. Emotions are, just like this film, an intense accumulation of inexplicable wandering half-lost half-found images and words. We're not looking for the real truth, and even less from a normal perspective or linear narrative. It appears that those who protest about this film want a nice, and informed, objective view of a relationship. But where's the good in that? How can someone tell a love story from the outside if he hasn't lived it himself? The &#145;endless' repetitions just bring up an immensely fresh way of telling a love story, which I am more than willing to appreciate. The slipping in of the child Otto into the grown-up Otto is just as great as any others, despite what some people say. The scene where he discovers his dead mother, the grown-up Otto is the one who wants to leave and ignore the reality, but it's the child Otto, with his child-like curiosity, that turns round and heads for the kitchen where his dead mother lies. If you didn't like this slipping in of each actor into different phases of their lives, you failed to see that this is a mere reflection on how people don't change. If emotions haven't changed throughout human history, they're not likely to change now, are they? Every person always keeps a bit of their child feelings in them, precisely what a cold-blooded critic is just as likely to fail to see.Some think they can strengthen their argument by pointing out the absence of story-line, and what in their eyes would be a more conscious production of art. However, the immense strength of the film is in aspects that aren't in the writing, but rather in the direction. Just admit it, some great films have incredibly simple story-lines and this is one of them. It's as if you set out to define the word &#145;love'. While one person can come up with a dictionary definition, another does so with an infinite number of images. The first person would complain that the story-line is only about one word, and the artist who's translated the word into those thousand images gets no credit. Please&#133;I was thinking of a definition someone gave me once about the meaning of poetry, which was that it was about trying to give justice to every word. Image poetry, just this film, is the same; every image in the film tries to give justice to every word in the story. So what's more important for a film, the image or the word? It doesn't matter, not here at least, but just in this case it's the images. The film is about presenting the words, and then giving them the justice they deserve in images. Most of the time, in this film it's about giving justice to the image by itself, and forgetting about the words.Now, comparing this with another director, like Kieslowski, is also approaching the issue in the wrong way. Everyone's different.. Medem thinks his way, and Khrystzov his, and they're both great. The latter was a very unhappy guy who gave his films an ironic touch by looking for life's beauty, a concept he was constantly doubting in real life. The former believes that love stories like in his film don't exist, but that it's good to think they do. They're both subtle in their own ways. They both reflect things even we may not understand. What's more, this film would be inappropriate for Kieslowski, because it has too much movement, and this director had a more static way of presenting his poetry. So just let things like these be. Each auteur brings his own viewpoint, and however underrated many of them are, and ignored and insulted, they're what I'm in this thing called cinema for. Back in Theo and Cleopatra from 5 to 7, they discussed whether art was worth it. Is it? Thousands die everyday and art doesn't save them. But what it does do is immortalise a person, an emotion, a feeling, an attitude&#133; Its there so that when one dies his thoughts aren't forgotten. A photograph remains even if the person is dead. Otto and Ana will remain even if we all die. I say respect every artist in cinema, and learn to appreciate their effort. And with this film, Medem contributed to film and to emotions at the same time, I'm not sure to which of the two he's done most for. We're living on borrowed time, people, so all I can say is that I hope that the nightly wind Medem created in &#145;Los Amantes' blows forever!
