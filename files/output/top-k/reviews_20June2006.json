The other night I felt the urge to see it again, from beginning to end, after that fun compilation from the AFI, 100 movies, 100 Cheers. The most surprising thing about this perennial classic is that it's not just a good movie but a sort of miracle. Age has made it more relevant, more powerful. Frank Capra is, without question, its miracle worker. His narration style was a first and in a way unsurpassed. As you may very well know, the film wasn't an instant success. A peculiarity it shares with most of the great works of art. The truth is something that needs time to be confirmed even recognized. James Stewart's performance lived from a 2006 stand point is, quite simply, extraordinary. Capra's films were known as capracorn in their day. Strange to think about it now because its sentimentality wasn't really sentimental but a need to find goodness in the darkest places. The great Capra not only found it, it unmasked it with the same relish that he unmasked evil and greed. My only regret is that on this times of technical prowess we'll never see again the likes of It's Wonderful Life But, trying to look on the bright side in the most Capraesque kind of way.

The fact that Elia Kazan made On The Waterfront in the first place makes it fair game for reviewing the film from the point of view of a political statement.In case you aren't aware, Elia Kazan was already a renowned film director by the time he willingly went before the House Un-American Activities Committee&#151;the Witch Hunt Committee&#151;and ratted out his friends with whom he had attended meetings of the Communist party. He basically did this to save his own Greek behind; there is certainly no indication that Kazan at any time really had any great belief that Communists were infiltrating Hollywood and were hell-bent on destroying the American way of life you know, buying things you don't need and dying in faraway lands to contribute to a President's inferiority over the size of his own testicles.Having destroyed several lives with his testimony, Kazan came under attack from certain quarters for his cowardly action. His response was a film that is so highly regarded it verges on the nauseating. (I'm not even going to get into the almost campy melodrama and the hysterical acting. I know it verges on a sacrilege to suggest that Marlon Brando was ever anything but brilliant during the 1950s, but in my opinion you won't see a more affected piece of acting in any other movie released during that decade). Brando's character Terry Malloy is supposed to be a stand-in for Elia Kazan, you see, cleaning out the filth so that a bum can become a contender. Well, here's the problem The left-leaning writers, directors and actors whose careers Kazan helped to end weren't gangster or criminals. IT HAS NEVER BEEN ILLEGAL TO BE A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY.So the analogy doesn't fit. To paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen Elia Kazan is no Terry Malloy. Kazan wasn't bruised and beaten on his quest to become a hero by rooting out a criminal element. Kazan was a bum and a rat bastard who should have been strung up by his tongue instead of awarded Oscars. The fact that this piece of sludge won so many Academy Awards is itself a testament to the fact that the Communist element in Hollywood was minor at best.Hollywood and movies are a business. They are owned and operated not to make art, but money. They exist to fulfill an Althusserian delivery of America's prevailing ideology&#151;capitalism is the answer to all our society's ills and problems&#151;and it would take more than ten or twenty or a hundred writers and directors to make a dent in that. Kazan did nothing to protect the minds of America from being infected by communist doctrine. (You know the kind of stuff I'm talking about free health care, affordable higher education for everybody, higher wages for workers, and less inheritance for Paris Hilton.) It is unconscionable to reward Kazan and anyone else connected with this movie with Oscars or any other kind of award.Look at it from this point of view Do you think a movie that explains why Benedict Arnold betrayed his fellow countrymen would ever receive such adulation? What about a movie that explained the murder of Sharon Tate from Charles Manson's point of view? Ah, I know what you're thinking Who's making the fallacious analogy now? Not me. Manson and his freaky buddies ended Tate's life as well as several others and threw countless other lives into disrepair. Are you aware that many of those who were blacklisted committed suicide? Then there's John Garfield who died of a heart attack at the age of 39 after battling the stress of the blacklist. And those who didn't commit suicide had their careers taken away from them for no other reason than that they attended a perfectly legal meeting years before.I'll go further with my analogy Elia Kazan is worse than Charles Manson.

Once Upon A Time In America, on the other hand, was a story practically made for the man. Running at over three and a half hours in the most complete cut known to exist today, its pace might be leisurely and its action incidental, but one other thing it has in common with other Leone films is that it is never slow or boring. As a film about gangsters, it is a fine example. As a film about looking back upon the twists and turns life can take, it is a masterpiece. Although there are moments when its sets or props reveal the time the film was shot in, OUATIA is a timeless exploration of how the bonds between boys stretch, alter, and even break as they become men. The tagline (As boys, they said they would die for each other. As men, they did.) is surprisingly accurate in summarising the film in spite of the fact that it gives very little away. It was Leone's last film, and a more fitting memorial simply does not exist in the medium.Ironically, for a film directed by a man who has yet to be equalled for using the 2.351 frame in a dynamic fashion, Once Upon A Time In America is the first film Leone shot in the 1.851 ratio. I have to confess the cinematography disappointed me somewhat, with this narrower composition clearly allowing fewer opportunities for creative crowd shots. However, there still are fine examples abound of why a film should never be pared down to fit the box-like television that is now thankfully on its way into the kind of nostalgic past that this film spends a lot of its time depicting. Complementing the visuals is a score by Ennio Morricone that, while recalling shades of C'era Una Volta Il West, also provides a more subtle, emotional undercurrent for the visuals. The strings and choir heard when a rather young Jennifer Connelly is visible remind one of the haunting soloist heard when Jill McBain steps out into the train station being built at the end of the aforementioned C'era Una Volta Il West, only it is just as good and far more restrained.Of course, no film can be what it is without actors, and Once Upon A Time In America has some of the best. The featurette included with the DVD-Video edition features James Woods describing how privileged he feels to have worked with Leone, and his performance in the film indicates he felt that way from the first. De Niro is also impeccable as the adult Noodles, portraying a young man, a middle-aged man, and an elderly man filled with regret using equal levels of skill and artistry. But in a contrast to Leone's other films, the surprise here is in the bit parts, where even the small walk-ons are portrayed with aplomb. Also surprising are the performances of the youngsters who portray our heroes during the earlier stages of the story. The aforementioned Connelly is a delight to watch, but Scott Tiler and Rusty Jacobs excel as youthful versions of De Niro and Woods. Even if you dispute Leone's composition and writing skills, one thing this film erases all doubts about is his ability to choose the right actors for the roles. Or perhaps he just brought out the very best in people.Roger Ebert has said that editing is the soul of the cinema. He also said it was The Brown Bunny's salvation. In the case of Once Upon A Time In America, excessive editing was its damnation. For some reason too illogical to contemplate, the distributors chose to cut OUATIA from its intended length down to a little more than two hours. As Ebert has also mentioned, this decision, as well as that to arrange the scenes in a chronological fashion, made the film seem far longer than the more complete 229-minute cut, and also deprived it of that critical ability to make sense. If you hear someone telling you that this film is lousy or not well-paced, make sure to ask them which version they have seen. Leone has said that he would have liked the film to be anywhere from 250 to 265 minutes. One can only wonder what this other footage would have revealed, but alas, it is in a raw and possibly unusable state. Leone reportedly wished to finish these scenes for a future release, but we all know what happened next, sadly.The use of transitions is also nothing short of brilliant. Early in the film, we hear a telephone ringing quite persistently, and the first twenty or so minutes feel quite disjointed. It is a testament to how well the film comes together that not only do all the pieces fit together like a sports car, the sound of a telephone ringing later in the film feels quite ominous. It is also a testament to the makeup artists' skill that Robert De Niro and James Woods appear at the chronological end of the film looking so old and ragged. About the only slip-up is that several of the main characters change eye-colour when they switch from their adult to child incarnations, and vice versa. For a younger cinemaphile seeing the film for the first time, it can be fun simply to see actors we have been taught to revere in the roles they played before they made portraying mobsters seem routine.

Once Upon A Time In America, on the other hand, was a story practically made for the man. Running at over three and a half hours in the most complete cut known to exist today, its pace might be leisurely and its action incidental, but one other thing it has in common with other Leone films is that it is never slow or boring. As a film about gangsters, it is a fine example. As a film about looking back upon the twists and turns life can take, it is a masterpiece. Although there are moments when its sets or props reveal the time the film was shot in, OUATIA is a timeless exploration of how the bonds between boys stretch, alter, and even break as they become men. The tagline (As boys, they said they would die for each other. As men, they did.) is surprisingly accurate in summarising the film in spite of the fact that it gives very little away. It was Leone's last film, and a more fitting memorial simply does not exist in the medium.Ironically, for a film directed by a man who has yet to be equalled for using the 2.351 frame in a dynamic fashion, Once Upon A Time In America is the first film Leone shot in the 1.851 ratio. I have to confess the cinematography disappointed me somewhat, with this narrower composition clearly allowing fewer opportunities for creative crowd shots. However, there still are fine examples abound of why a film should never be pared down to fit the box-like television that is now thankfully on its way into the kind of nostalgic past that this film spends a lot of its time depicting. Complementing the visuals is a score by Ennio Morricone that, while recalling shades of C'era Una Volta Il West, also provides a more subtle, emotional undercurrent for the visuals. The strings and choir heard when a rather young Jennifer Connelly is visible remind one of the haunting soloist heard when Jill McBain steps out into the train station being built at the end of the aforementioned C'era Una Volta Il West, only it is just as good and far more restrained.Of course, no film can be what it is without actors, and Once Upon A Time In America has some of the best. The featurette included with the DVD-Video edition features James Woods describing how privileged he feels to have worked with Leone, and his performance in the film indicates he felt that way from the first. De Niro is also impeccable as the adult Noodles, portraying a young man, a middle-aged man, and an elderly man filled with regret using equal levels of skill and artistry. But in a contrast to Leone's other films, the surprise here is in the bit parts, where even the small walk-ons are portrayed with aplomb. Also surprising are the performances of the youngsters who portray our heroes during the earlier stages of the story. The aforementioned Connelly is a delight to watch, but Scott Tiler and Rusty Jacobs excel as youthful versions of De Niro and Woods. Even if you dispute Leone's composition and writing skills, one thing this film erases all doubts about is his ability to choose the right actors for the roles. Or perhaps he just brought out the very best in people.Roger Ebert has said that editing is the soul of the cinema. He also said it was The Brown Bunny's salvation. In the case of Once Upon A Time In America, excessive editing was its damnation. For some reason too illogical to contemplate, the distributors chose to cut OUATIA from its intended length down to a little more than two hours. As Ebert has also mentioned, this decision, as well as that to arrange the scenes in a chronological fashion, made the film seem far longer than the more complete 229-minute cut, and also deprived it of that critical ability to make sense. If you hear someone telling you that this film is lousy or not well-paced, make sure to ask them which version they have seen. Leone has said that he would have liked the film to be anywhere from 250 to 265 minutes. One can only wonder what this other footage would have revealed, but alas, it is in a raw and possibly unusable state. Leone reportedly wished to finish these scenes for a future release, but we all know what happened next, sadly.The use of transitions is also nothing short of brilliant. Early in the film, we hear a telephone ringing quite persistently, and the first twenty or so minutes feel quite disjointed. It is a testament to how well the film comes together that not only do all the pieces fit together like a sports car, the sound of a telephone ringing later in the film feels quite ominous. It is also a testament to the makeup artists' skill that Robert De Niro and James Woods appear at the chronological end of the film looking so old and ragged. About the only slip-up is that several of the main characters change eye-colour when they switch from their adult to child incarnations, and vice versa. For a younger cinemaphile seeing the film for the first time, it can be fun simply to see actors we have been taught to revere in the roles they played before they made portraying mobsters seem routine.

I am primarily of German descent, with some English, Swiss and Irish thrown in. But a good deal of my father's side is Scottish. I am descended from the Murrays, the Turnbulls and the Jacksons, and I am proud of it. This movie has only further cemented my pride. Mel Gibson (say what you want about his world-view, his directorial style, his factual accuracy) has created one of the greatest epics in cinema since Spartacus (I know, I know, usually it's Lawrence of Arabia, but I've never seen that. I have seen Spartacus, though, and loved it.) The story told is of one of the greatest national heroes of Scotland, William Wallace. He, like many, wanted a peaceful life; love, land, and a line, but he was willing to sacrifice that so that others may have that and something else as well freedom. He lead an army of commoners against the mighty armies of England and King Edward Longshanks the I, and struck fear in the heart of tyrants and those who blindly serve them. Gibson plays this hero with courage and passion, bringing to life this man whose real life is still shrouded in uncertainty and mystery. Ultimately, he dies (in a fashion reserved for the highest traitors, but Gibson goes light for the sake of those who have already weathered over two hours of the bloodiest 14th century combat.) but his death inspires the men of Scotland to fight and die for the one thing Wallace chose to cry out for in his last breath. There are great performances across the board by Patrick McGoohan, the pagan king of England, Peter Hanly, his weak, homosexual son, and Angus Macfadyen, as the powerful Robert the Bruce (who is not officially my namesake; my grandfather's middle name was Robert, but I would be proud if Bruce was my namesake.) Macfadyen portrays a man born to power and authority, torn between his conniving father and Wallace. Ultimately, he chooses to follow in the footsteps of the fallen Wallace, saying the film's most powerful line You have bled with Wallce, now bleed with me! Braveheart, though a hard film to watch due to it's sheer brutality, is now one of my favorite films. It makes me proud to be a (part) Scot, it makes me proud to be named Robert, and it makes me proud that my ancestor William of Rule (purportedly) saved Bruce from a raging bull, thus earning his clan their name.

It's a very good movie and I really think that the actors, the sets, the artistic vision of the project are absolutely amazing. I really think that the actors were well cast (especially Elijah Wood who suits perfectly for the main role). The trouble is in the special effects. Sometimes, it's so weird and ugly that it's hard to realize that a film like this can have such bad special effects. I think about the faces of Elijah Wood and Hugo Weaving on a white screen. The limits of their faces are fading. It's very very ugly. I also think about the moment when you see a black horse rider facing a beautiful and peaceful landscape. It looks like the landscape is painted (it's sure that it is, it's so beautiful and impossible to built as a set) and in front of that painted landscape, you see a little grass, which is supposed to show that the rider faces this landscape and that he is on a hill. It's also strange to see that when you have shots from the sky (I don't know what is the name of that in English words) showing the hobbits running through the forests, the color of the trees is not the same as when you see closer shots. It's also the same thing when you see Gandalf, the Grey on the high tower (where he is kept prisoner by Saroumane) and you have an impressing shot which goes directly to Gandalf like a traveling shot (although it's in the air). The camera comes to Gandalf and the shot starts with an ensemble shot, you see that, at one moment, the digital effects come to reality and it's a little bit disturbing.It really looks, according to me, like Star Wars  in fact, it's sometimes really ridiculous (the fight between Saroumane and Gandalf certainly is) but, you don't why, you like it and you can't prevent yourself from thinking that it's great.

'The Crimson Pirate' is joyous in how much fun that it has with both the swashbuckler genre and with itself. It was an absolute joy to watch it and for two weeks now, every time I think of it I just start to laugh. Besides, how can you resist any movie where manly man Burt Lancaster lampoons his own image ... by dressing up as the ugliest dancing girl you'll ever (hopefully!) see?Old circus buddies Burt Lancaster and Nick Cravat star and Lancaster is in probably the best of his acrobatic performances. Some of his dramatic work was stronger, but this is one of his best comedic performances. I think Burt Lancaster easily matches the swashbuckling charm of, say, Errol Flynn. This is escapist fare at its best with great potential for a wide audience. Great for kids and with more than ample humour for the parents too. Pirates, interestingly, aren't given a very dark treatment here as the focus tends to be more on the sense of adventure in sailing the seas. Capturing ships and treasure is more a celebration of playful trickery and impishness than combat and death. Enemies in this film are subdued by being tossed overboard -- pistols, swords and other assorted mêlée weapons are generally props.Lancaster and Cravat are great to watch together and Cravat very nearly steals the film form Lancaster as his mute sidekick (apparently his accent was distractingly thick so they opted to make him a mute who pantomimed instead). His ability to express things through the looks he create on his face are just wonderful. One of his best scenes is when he's trying to decide if he should stick with Lancaster or side with the mutinous crew.Humour abounds. I love that the highly mutinous and hilariously named crew is ready to rape, torture, pillage and murder anyone who gets in their way, but always speak with impeccable manners. The ringleader is constantly interrupting Lancaster by saying things like Begging your pardon Captain but I was just wondering ... and so on. Important lesson for the kids even pirates need to use their manners! For one of the best extended comedic pieces I've seen in a while too, how can anyone not enjoy the pursuit through the streets of Lancaster, Cravat and the scientist with the boat on their heads?

Capone, Luciano, Gotti&#133; You know the drill.This is probably why I wanted to love it, but the film just wouldn't allow me to. It never gets exciting enough.In Hoodlum the main characters; Johnson, Queenie, Hewlett, Schultz, Luciano; are all played just well enough to give you a basic outline of how the real life persons were related to one another. Otherwise they're basically stock representations of what Hollywood seems to always believe everyone wants to see in genre crime films, or maybe just something Dukes felt was necessary to make it fit the genre along with all the the typical gobbledy gook that's SUPPOSED to cause you to react in a certain way. Ewwww! He places a bit of human anatomy on the night club table! Oh my! The poor man has distanced himself from those closest to him in order to fulfill a noble, if cruel, mission!Yet it never gets horrible enough to really make you feel it. A woman is murdered, but you don't see anything beyond her fright. Even her boyfriend's reaction at finding her body isn't given enough attention for you to understand what he feels. You're always 'watching' other people react to situations&#133; You're never in a position to see their feelings or to truly feel anything yourself.Romance comes together weakly and ends weakly. Chattering tommy gun montages float but no bodies shiver. Death comes and goes like Spring rain.Roth's Schultz is, to my mind's eye, the only thing near a believable performance. He dresses, speaks and conducts himself much the way the real Schultz would've. The 'race' issue is weirdly half-hyped throughout this film though it is presented in a manner easily recognizable as commonplace during the period. The film makes the mistake of making this almost too important a part of the story by having it pop into the script when it hardly matters. That a corrupt 1930s chief of police is also a die-hard racist and some black doesn't like it and says so is not quite as cutting edge as it might've been 25 years ago.I'm no longer amused by Luciano being shown as the dapper smoothie. The real person wasn't as dapper as he was clever.All the same, it isn't likely that Luciano would've had a man shot in the back of his own limousine while he's sitting right next to him protecting his face from blood-splatter with his spotless Panama hat. Do you know how much a Panama hat cost? They should've thrown in a joke to help that scene along.The Dewey portrayal was totally ridiculous. His relationship to Luciano was never so chummy as the film wants to suggest. Far from it in fact.What the film did do is give me a thirst to learn more about the real people. It was nice to learn why Clarence Williams' Hewlett character stood so firmly with Schultz. (In real life Hewlett's operation had been knocked out of prominence by Queenie's gang); that Queenie had been attracted to Bumpy's style and bravado; that Queenie sent a message to Schultz while he lay dying in a hospital helps to lend some validity to this movie's suggestion of how some troubles may have been fomented between Schultz and Luciano.They skip over valuable and interesting detail in favor of weak emotional inference. Offering a a touch of supposedly, meaningful-to-blacks religious suggestion. An odd blend of Christianity and voodoo. Some grinning church toady at the start and finish of the story.

With a top notch cast including Temuera Morrison and Cliff Curtis, the acting is fantastic and goes hand in hand with the tightly scripted pace, which led to an thought-provoking one hundred and two minutes of film.Once Were Warriors tells a story familiar to many New Zealand families. Set in 1994, against the backdrop of Otara, Auckland, it tells the story of Beth and Jake Heke. Jake is an all round under achiever with a nasty temper and a fondness of beer. He likes to be the king of his state-house castle and his local pub, The Royal. Beth is the strong willed runaway who married Jake against her tribe's wishes. She loves Jake enough to forget the price he is having on her family - Nig, Boogie, Grace, Polly and Huata. Nig is the oldest boy, and hates his father for abusing Beth; his hate leads him to join the TOA gang. Boogie is also getting into trouble and Grace has turned to writing as an escape from her lout of a father. This story forces Beth to confront her husband's violence, and decide which is more important; his needs or her family.The performances in this movie were superb. Temuera Morrison is excellent as Jake Heke. He is convincing as both the lovable chap, when he and Beth sing 'The Nature of Love', and a frightening monster, when he beats Beth. In the final scene, he is incredible! Despite his violent words (he uses one expletive 17 times in less than 30 seconds), Morrison manages to display a kind of brokenness, that made me feel pity for him despite his previous actions, which most viewers would agree were appalling. Rena Owens was also extraordinary as the vibrant and resilient Beth Heke. She is totally believable. She is Beth. Her acting is incredibly varied. Owens shows Beth's vulnerability. After Jake's beating, she is weak and injured which is a total contrast to the last scene where she is strong even the face of Jake's fury, coming back with Our people once were warriors. But unlike you, Jake, they were people with mana, pride; people with spirit. If my spirit can survive living with you for eighteen years, then I can survive anything. The performances of Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell (Grace), Shannon Williams (Toot) and Sonny Arahanga (Nig) were also exceptionally moving. Basically, there were very few performances in this movie unworthy of a standing ovation.Another really positive aspect of Once Were Warriors was the setting. Tamahori's aim was to produce a tough, gritty, urban-based drama, which showed the destructiveness of urban life-style. You don't get much more urban in New Zealand than Otara. The film has amazing contrasts in it with setting. As a New Zealand movie, you expect beautiful mountains, hills, lakes, the clean and the green, and the beautiful first shot sets the scene for such things. When you see it's just a billboard and that the closest the Hekes have to that ideal is the dead-looking tree in their backyard, it reinforces that idea of the country as a nurturing place. Even the lighting and colors of the places help with this. Otara is dark, shabby, and gray. There's no color in their home or in their lives. The Marae, set in the country, by a beautiful lake, is bathed in golden light, symbolic of the joy and color within them at this time.There was a lot of good stuff about this movie but it also had its down points. There was a lot of violence which is important to the story, but was a little too graphic and hard to watch for some of the people in my class. It also tends to present the view that all Maori people are constantly drunk and swearing; that none have jobs or cars; and that all they do is drink, have parties and beat and rape people. The only ones that don't live on Maraes. This movie deals with the huge international issue of domestic violence, and although the Heke family is Maori, these are issues which affect all races and societies. It also shows the power and beauty of the Maori culture, and makes you understand that Jake is not the ideal role- model for any society.This movie IS good, but don't be under the impression it's a feel good favorite that you'd like to gather your family around for a light evening of entertainment. This movie is basically a tell-all on domestic violence. It shows violence as the ugly thing it is. Once Were Warriors is not for fun, this is a drama that really makes you think, discuss, confront and actually do something about problems in your society. It is a worthwhile watch, if you can approach the film with an open mind.

Despite his violent words (he uses one expletive 17 times in less than 30 seconds), Morrison manages to display a kind of brokenness, that made me feel pity for him despite his previous actions, which most viewers would agree were appalling. Rena Owens was also extraordinary as the vibrant and resilient Beth Heke. She is totally believable. She is Beth. Her acting is incredibly varied. Owens shows Beth's vulnerability. After Jake's beating, she is weak and injured which is a total contrast to the last scene where she is strong even the face of Jake's fury, coming back with Our people once were warriors. But unlike you, Jake, they were people with mana, pride; people with spirit. If my spirit can survive living with you for eighteen years, then I can survive anything. The performances of Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell (Grace), Shannon Williams (Toot) and Sonny Arahanga (Nig) were also exceptionally moving. Basically, there were very few performances in this movie unworthy of a standing ovation.Another really positive aspect of Once Were Warriors was the setting. Tamahori's aim was to produce a tough, gritty, urban-based drama, which showed the destructiveness of urban life-style. You don't get much more urban in New Zealand than Otara. The film has amazing contrasts in it with setting. As a New Zealand movie, you expect beautiful mountains, hills, lakes, the clean and the green, and the beautiful first shot sets the scene for such things. When you see it's just a billboard and that the closest the Hekes have to that ideal is the dead-looking tree in their backyard, it reinforces that idea of the country as a nurturing place. Even the lighting and colors of the places help with this. Otara is dark, shabby, and gray. There's no color in their home or in their lives. The Marae, set in the country, by a beautiful lake, is bathed in golden light, symbolic of the joy and color within them at this time.There was a lot of good stuff about this movie but it also had its down points. There was a lot of violence which is important to the story, but was a little too graphic and hard to watch for some of the people in my class. It also tends to present the view that all Maori people are constantly drunk and swearing; that none have jobs or cars; and that all they do is drink, have parties and beat and rape people. The only ones that don't live on Maraes. This movie deals with the huge international issue of domestic violence, and although the Heke family is Maori, these are issues which affect all races and societies. It also shows the power and beauty of the Maori culture, and makes you understand that Jake is not the ideal role- model for any society.This movie IS good, but don't be under the impression it's a feel good favorite that you'd like to gather your family around for a light evening of entertainment. This movie is basically a tell-all on domestic violence. It shows violence as the ugly thing it is. Once Were Warriors is not for fun, this is a drama that really makes you think, discuss, confront and actually do something about problems in your society. It is a worthwhile watch, if you can approach the film with an open mind.

As a teenager, young Quasimodo longs to be out of his bell tower and down with the normal people &#150; his statue friends just aren't cutting it anymore. Joining a carnival in disguise, Quasimodo is exposed and held up for ridicule by all in attendance and it is only the kindness of gypsy girl Esmeralda that spares him. This act of defiance against the mob sees Esmeralda targeted by Frollo, who already has made it his aim to take care of the gypsy problem, and sees her relying on Quasimodo to return her kindness.Although I'm not a massive fan of the all-singing, all-wholesome Disney cartoons I must confess that when I'm in the mood they can be good fun and quite engaging. And so it was with this film even if it wasn't that impressive. The basic story is one of the ugly outcast, tolerance and not judging books by covers &#150; all Disney staples in regards themes. It is engaging enough stuff and although it doesn't have a real depth to it, it does have a surprising amount of darker material and ideas within it. The characters are mostly well drawn and the film allows the comic sidekicks to be sidekicks and doesn't allow easy jokes to dominate the story (although they provide amusement when given the chance). The songs are quite grand and engaging (with the exception of the horrid syrup that plays over the final credits) and although none of them stuck in my mind they did the job.The animation is solid although it is hard for me to view fairly because I am watching it from ten years in the future after big leaps have been made. That said it all looks good and the attention to detail is impressive. The cast are mostly good. Personally I didn't like Hulce that much. I accept that he had to be a teenage boy but his voice is too soft and I didn't really buy the pain that was supposed to be in his character. Moore is a bit better mainly because her voice has more character. Jay is menacing and effective while Kline is pretty good in the hero role. Support from Alexander, Kimbrough, Clopin and others is mostly very good.Overall this is a fun family film that isn't as sharp or as deep as it could have been but pretty much does everything well. The story is good and engaging, the cast are mostly good, the songs are fitting and the animation is colourful and fun. Well worth seeing for Disney fans and a good film to watch with a young family.

Thereupon begins a character study of these two people, played by Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, and told in flashbacks from the POV of the woman's two grown children, after she has died.Streep's character leads a life of stability and bland security. For her, the stranger represents a more adventurous life, one of excitement and new experiences, and an escape from the mundane details of an ordinary, but stable, life. But whenever a person selects one path, he or she necessarily forgoes alternate paths. It's everyone's dilemma. As usual, Meryl Streep gives a wonderfully convincing performance. Also, I must credit makeup artist Roy Helland, who did a great job, especially at the film's end when Streep's character is made to look much older. And the film has a finale that is realistic, rather than cinematically predictable.This is the kind of story that needs to be told slowly. And it is. But it is way too slow. Several times, as when, for example, Eastwood and Streep are slow dancing around the breakfast table, the plot almost grinds to a halt. With a runtime of well over two hours, some of the more lethargic moments could have been edited out. I also did not like the casting of the two adult children whom I found irritating. And, with all those wrinkles, that frizzy gray hair, and that receding hairline, Eastwood was about twenty years too old for the role he plays, in my opinion.The Bridges Of Madison County has its good moments, especially when it is making some social commentary on nosy, small town America.
