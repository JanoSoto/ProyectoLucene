I respect the original for what it was but this version directed by Tim Burton is visually spectacular and exceeds expectations.Nobody creates a fanciful world like Burton can and there is no better duo than Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter. The costumes for the apes are incredible with intricate details that look very realistic. The sheer enormity of the sets makes you realise how much energy and passion went into creating this film.I love all the action, and the special effects still seem remarkable even after more than 10 years has past. Sometimes people can't move past the original but if you have never seen the 1968 version then I think you will enjoy this movie. Also it is perfect to watch again now that the new planet of the apes movie series has started to be released.

I wasn't familiar with her until a few years ago. The oddities I found in her music swept me into a strange state while the sudden power of her voice in the high range shattered all barriers that could have made the oddities relevant. She is unlike anything I've heard before.Bjork's character, Selma Jezkova, works in a factory and lives with her young son. She is slowly going blind and she tries very hard to hide it until the inevitable blindness takes hold. She is obsessed with musicals and loves to sing and dance.Someone very close to me always talks about how they live from event to event; looking forward to the next big thing helps them get through the boring nothingness of the day-to-day. These events can be things as simple as going out to dinner with friends, or a birthday party, or a vacation. If the event is a month or two, or even several months away, they still seem to be able to use that as a tool for escaping and speeding through the days in between. This strikes me as a little tragic. This method of speeding through life, and the more you build up the excitement for this upcoming event, the more crushing it feels when the night draws to a close and you must go back to work the next day. Selma Jezkova would reject this mindset in a heart beat, I think. Despite Selma's being deprived of the colloquial windows to the soul, the viewer can still see the aura of positivity, energy, and strength throughout the character's fight. Without her eyesight, she is hyper-sensitive to sound, but what's evocative to me is that she is even more sensitive to the lack of sound, to silence. In these moments, she takes advantage of the creative light inside her to transform her own reality, turning her increasingly challenging factory work into a stage for a big song and dance number. This happens at work, at the moment when the single potential love interest in her life Jeff, (Peter Stormare), discovers her blindness, and in a few more, much darker occurrences later on.To be conscious of life's rhythms, to learn to make music where there seems to be only darkness, these are just a few of the themes I personally took away from this film. One of the most poignant lines in the movie include when Selma talks about how she used to cheat the ending of a musical by leaving right after the second to last number. This way the musical never ends. I thought about being in a crowded lot for a show and my husband urging us to leave right before the last song to miss the crowds. I was really against the idea. In my mind we'd paid money to see the whole show, why would we skip what could potentially be the best part? To me, it was a way of cutting through the natural progression of an ending in order to try and escape from the pain of an ending that comes without your permission, or despite anything you would do to stop it from happening. Even through the course of her tragic crime towards the end of the film, Selma gets through by transforming her world into that of a musical, where loose ends tie up neatly and everything makes sense, where all is forgiven and forgotten. But this method of trying desperately to maintain her strength eventually comes crashing down, as though all of those endings she'd cheated in her life have come back to get her all at once. Bjork's performance throughout the ending of the film had me balling my eyes out. Her character was created and portrayed so solidly that every ounce of my being as a viewer struggled through those last scenes, waiting for a miracle.But then something happened that is just as incredible as if she'd been rescued by an angel in a chariot from heaven. In her last moments, Selma begins singing, fleeing the scene of her execution in a sense, her death interrupting her mid-song. The text at the end of the film exposes the words that were cut off They say it's the last song. They don't know us, you see. It's only the last song if we let it be. The morbid image of a curtain falling across the point where Selma left this world, like the ending of a musical, provokes the very silence which Selma had been so frightened of just a few minutes before, while a silent, motionless few in the audience stare, as if rapt in the memory of what they'd just been witness to. I wonder, where is the line that separates mind over matter and escapism? At what point does thinking positively towards a goal slip into disconnect between thought and action? I think that Selma's character demonstrates the strength of a spirit so passionate that it can't lie down and die quietly, even when every possibility of escape is closed off. I think that at the point where all hope is lost for her body, Selma is pushed to free her mind, elevating it above the body in that instant to escape the fear of death. Her body has failed her, first in losing her eyesight, and then in the panicked moments that push her into murder. She ultimately rejects the body and preserves to the very end the joy in her heart and mind, like an ember that slowly succumbs to the darkness. http\/\/funkyforestfirstcontact.wordpress.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"22 February 2014","score":"","review":" The first Bjork song that made me cry was Mutual Core from her 2011 album Biophilia.
