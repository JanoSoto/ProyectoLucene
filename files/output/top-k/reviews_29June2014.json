It appears to be a horror and a thriller but, while it does contain some guts and suspense, the film is much more than a generic horror. Ravenous has elements of adventure and some black comedy in quirky moments, more so in the first half, and thrills that are more-so concept and emotionally based rather than cheap adrenalin. The point is that it's a bad idea going into this film because you heard it was a picking-off-the-victims gore-fest.The film begins with events following soon after the Mexican-American War where Second Lieutenant (John) Boyd (Guy Pearce) is struggling after letting his unit down while they are massacred. He stumbled into the Mexican headquarters and, in a bout of bravery, managed to capture enemy command from within. He is haunted by images and flashbacks of the mass of deaths and aggression he has witnessed. Boyd is promoted to Captain for his heroism, but his commanding officer discovers the cowardly truth of this victory. Boyd is exiled to Fort Spencer in the Sierra Nevada. Boyd settles in with 7 interesting residents of Fort Spencer. Soon they're all introduced to a man who shows up in the night weak and injured. He proceeds to explain to them a disturbing account of his group turning to cannibalism having him flee in fear of his life and the Spencer team setting off with him venturing back in obligation to the cave which he has fled to save a woman he admits he has left alone in danger.Apart from the events that take place in the film, the situation John Boyd finds himself in is a reflection of honest morality with a front focus on temptation and the will power not to give in. It is really a matter of opinion whether this is appealing, which is is for me, but it really doesn't hurt for one to open their mind.Ravenous can get you to think if you let it do so.

It tells two stories that have a running theme and are connected by something that I suspect is a haunted library complete with floating books (remind you of anything?) and a pair of narrators that are heard but never seen.The stories are classics, kind of morality tales populated by colorful characters. The first &#x96; in spite of movie's title &#x96; is the tale of Mr. Toad, narrated by Basil Rathbone. It comes from Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows featuring the speed-loving Mr. Toad who is addicted to new inventions and anything that can satisfy his lust for extreme sports. He's got a lust for life but seems to be blind to the fact that he's a magnet for property damage. This concerns his friends Mr. Rat, Mr. Mole and Angus MacBadger. They try and talk their friend out of his addiction, but it's just at that moment that he has a near-orgasmic moment when he spots his very first motor car.He must have it, and he goes to such lengths as selling his manor Toad Hall to a crooked barkeep named Winkie. When Toad is arrested, Winkie claims that the car was stolen and Toad is sent off to prison. So, his buddies gather together to free their friend and expose Winkie as a fraud.One thing that I notice, first of all, is that Mr. Toad is not really likable. He's an addict, and only really learns his lesson when he neck is on the line. And even THAT doesn't last.I like the clean animation here and the voices aren't you typical cartoon voices. Too often you hear voices of animated characters that are so distracting that your mind fixates on the celebrity behind the microphone rather than the character and their motivation. Here they seem to fit perfectly, especially Rathbone who is quite a good storyteller.I like the characters but the one that stands out is Toad's horse friend Cyril Proudbottom who joins him in his escapades.The second story retells Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and is narrated by Bing Crosby. The difference here is that the narration tells the story rather than the characters. Here we meet Ichabod Crane, as a man of appetites. Despite his thin frame he's constantly eating and he's constantly has a lust in his heart for money. Actually, this Ichabod is kind of unlikeable. He begins a courtship with the farmer's daughter Katrina but his inner monologue tells us that he's looking forward to inheriting the farm. He constantly one-ups his rival Brom Bones, but as we see, Ichabod is a guy who doesn't know when the quit.I love the animation here. There are a lot of exaggerated motions, especially on Icabod, but of course, the best is saved for last, as Ichabod heads home and becomes the prey of The Headless Horseman. This scene is brilliant especially in the moments before the chase with those clouds closing in on the mood, the cat-tails thumping on the log &#x96; and THEN the headless horsemen, which is a terrifying sight.You wouldn't imagine that these two stories would fit together, but I think what we have are the stories of two guys who live by their appetites, with concern for little else. Both get their comeuppance but it's not really made clear that they learned anything. Personally, I like that approach.Now, when you see these stories on television their usually broken up into separate cartoons &#x96; no, I shouldn't soft-soap it, they're ALWAYS broken up into two stories. I don't think it works as well. Their effective separately but together there's a nice narrative arch between them. It's one of Disney's nice buried treasures.

Louis Gossett, Jr. certainly earned the Oscar he won for his performance as Foley and Gere is at his best as Mayo whose character develops from a selfish loner to that of somebody willing to help his classmates at his own expense.

The Legend of Drunken Master truly showcases just how flexible and high-flying Chan is in one of his best martial arts action films out there (even better than the Rush Hour series). You have to see this with your own eyes if you want to catch my drift. This movie has one enjoyable scene after another. The simplistic display of storytelling will keep you intrigued along with the heart-pumping action, wonderful comical moments and a very tantalizing plot. The characters are very rich and vibrant like the comical performance from Anita Mui as Wong's (Chan) step-mom Ling to the insanely antagonistic bad guy Ken Lo as Jon\/John. The casting decisions were well put together that adds dimension to the story and the characters. The story is about an iconic folk hero named Wong Fei Hung, a well- meaning, but naive student in the art of Drunken Boxing also known as Zui Quan. Even though he tries not to get involved when trouble is on the horizon, he becomes a witness to British thieves who are robbing rare priceless Chinese artifacts out of the country. Wong feels it his destiny to use his unorthodox fighting skills to prevent this happening.I know the concept of Drunken Boxing sounds utterly ridiculous, but it's anything but. When it comes to surreal fighting fight scenes, Jackie Chan is a master in this parameter. He makes these fight look real and very easy. And with all his movies, street-fighting appears all the time. But here, Chan's fighting is more aerial and flamboyant than compared to his other films and it's equally believable as the stuff he's done before in the past and present. The final showdown at the factory has lots of wonderful action, it's enough to make any action junkie's mouth water. Jackie Chan is not alone in this movie. The supporting cast turn in some very enthralling performances as well. Wong's parents Ling (Anita Mui) and Wong Kei Ying (Ti Lung) are exciting to watch because they are very contrary to one another. Ti Lung is loving and caring father who wants best for Wong, but still believes he must inflict tough love on him. Meanwhile Ling is the more spontaneous step-mother who has good sense of humour, while still protects her son from getting into trouble with his father. The polar opposites between each other balance the movie quite substantially. The fight scenes are some of the most intense I have scene in martial arts action films in cinematic history. One of the most memorable fighting scenes in this movie is when Wong and an associate take down every member of a large gang of hoodlums known as The Ax Gang. I could elaborate further with this scene, but it's the exciting climax at the factory that really cranks up the heat as Wong takes down an army of bad guys before taking down the main kingpin. Jon\/John is played by Ken Lo. This guy is equally talented of a fighter as Chan and was great formidable opponent for Wong. His kicking ability is enough to put his own arms out of commission. Most of the fight Lo is kicking Chan's can all over the place. At one point his kicks lands Chan into some flaming coals and like every time Chan succeeds in keeping it real.That scene along will likely make your jaw drop. Then like when Popeye eat spinach, Jackie consumes some industrial beverage and regains his composure and manages to finish off his evil adversary which makes you wonder if fighting dunk has a better advantage than when you are sober. The final scenes are just truly amazing and exciting. I guess the drunken fighting is to take your opponent off his mark but are at par with the drinker. Chan pulls this stunt off without a hitch. The fight scenes were beautifully crisp and well choreographed so much that you only wished those scenes lasted for days. If you like martial arts action movies and you have never seen this one, what the hell are you waiting for? This is a high-ranking action film up there with other action movies of this calibre like Enter the Dragon and Iron Monkey. Lots of well orchestrated stunts and fight sequences, this movie will keep you entertained the whole way through.

Most of the fight Lo is kicking Chan's can all over the place. At one point his kicks lands Chan into some flaming coals and like every time Chan succeeds in keeping it real.That scene along will likely make your jaw drop. Then like when Popeye eat spinach, Jackie consumes some industrial beverage and regains his composure and manages to finish off his evil adversary which makes you wonder if fighting dunk has a better advantage than when you are sober. The final scenes are just truly amazing and exciting. I guess the drunken fighting is to take your opponent off his mark but are at par with the drinker. Chan pulls this stunt off without a hitch. The fight scenes were beautifully crisp and well choreographed so much that you only wished those scenes lasted for days. If you like martial arts action movies and you have never seen this one, what the hell are you waiting for? This is a high-ranking action film up there with other action movies of this calibre like Enter the Dragon and Iron Monkey. Lots of well orchestrated stunts and fight sequences, this movie will keep you entertained the whole way through.

Beggar Su's techniques are harsh but very effective, so when an assassin named Thunderfoot (Hwang Jang Lee) is hired to kill Fei-Hung's father, the young man is able to step in and save the day.Jackie Chan's comedic style is very much in evidence here, with buffoonery, slapstick action, and fart and poo gags, plus quite a few characters with peculiar facial features (a hairy mole, a red nose, drawn on freckles and goofy teeth), and the humour will not appeal to all (I nearly always struggle with Chinese comedy). Thankfully, the excellent fighting more than makes up for the silliness, with Jackie performing some mind-bogglingly amazing feats of physical prowess, making the absolute most of his Chinese Circus training. He leaps, he flips, he tumbles, he kicks, and he punches, performing snake style, monkey style and&#x97;of course&#x97;drunken style, all with incredible energy, speed and split second timing; it's absolutely breathtaking to behold.Naturally, Beggar Su and Thunderfoot are no slouches in the chop socky department either, the old drunken beggar pulling off some very cool moves against a baddie called The Stick King (Hsia Hsu) and Thunderfoot more than living up to his title with his technique 30% hands and 70% legs, Hwang Jang Lee is given plenty of opportunity to show off his legendary kicking skills. Also very impressive in her small role as Wong Fei Hung's auntie is Linda Lin Ying I don't know much about her, but the one fight scene she shares with Jackie is quite stunning&#x97;her flexibility and leg control made my jaw drop (I must check out some of the other titles in her filmography&#x97;Dance of the Drunk Mantis also stars Hwang Jang Lee, so that would seem like an obvious place to start).

Film trailers were around to preview movies to the masses, but the likes of viral marketing campaigns, online speculation, and teasers for teaser trailers were rare, if existent at all. Instead, film's were marketed for what they were, no tricks involved. That's why the release of The Blair Witch Project in 1999 had such an impact on film marketing. Using a website that documented mythology of the titular Blair Witch, trailers that hinted at the film's footage being completely real, and reports that the actors in the film were missing and presumed dead, audiences were instantly attracted to the tiny indie film's mysterious nature and uncertainty regarding the reality of its story. This all goes without noting how utterly terrifying The Blair Witch Project truly is, using tactics that distance itself from most other horror movies, old and new.The Blair Witch Project follows the story hinted at throughout the film's massive marketing campaign planning on shooting a documentary about Burkittsville, Maryland's fabled Blair Witch, three film students, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams, set out to prove the existence of the Blair Witch in October of 1994. Interviews with locals before the actual search fare mixed opinions on the subject, ranging from citizens who completely deny the fable to locals who explain, in detail, how a hermit named Rustin Parr kidnapped, tortured, and murdered children.After wrapping up enough footage to use for the documentary's opening scene and introductory statements, the three students head into the woods of north Burkittsville to hopefully catch proof of the Blair Witch for their film. However, it doesn't take long for the three inexperienced hikers to find themselves lost and traveling in circles. Of course, it also doesn't help that an unseen entity continually harasses Heather, Josh, and Mike during the night, leaving only mysterious rock formations and stick figures as evidence. It's safe to say that the production of the harmless documentary soon turns into the worst experience of the three filmmakers' lives.While rumors of the film showing real footage were shot down, the movie creates an atmosphere that certainly accounts for the rumors. This mostly comes from the fact that the film had no script. In most cases, that would result in an instant failure, but in the case of The Blair Witch Project, it plays heavily in its favor. Using only a 68 page outline and a custom made mythology, devised from old history such as a 16th century mystic, the film's dialogue was completely improvised by the actors. This makes an already relatable concept of being lost in the woods with no sense of direction all the more realistic.Of course, a script that relies on improvisation requires strong improvisation skills from its actors, and in that regard, The Blair Witch Project succeeds masterfully. The actors, who all used their real names, all seem to have genuine reactions to the events around them as the horrors continuously escalate. When they finish filming their introduction, they seem genuinely happy; when they find themselves going in circles, they seem genuinely angry; when they stumble across the famous stick figures, they seem genuinely terrified. Easily the most well-acted scene comes in the instantly recognizable scene where Heather gives her famous monologue the fear is easily seen in her tear-filled eyes and stuttering voice as she struggles to apologize for her actions.Some of the credit for such genuine reactions has to go to the directors, Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick. Using various means, Sanchez and Myrick pushed their actors to their limits in order to get the best reactions possible. For example, when the actors slept, the two directors would purposely sabotage the actors food and create some strife among them, which played out in the next scene. The real directorial success, however, is how the titular Blair Witch is never actually seen on screen. The result is a much more horrifying film, forcing the viewer to use only the sounds around the characters and their own imaginations to realize just what is tormenting these three students. This tactic separates itself from most other horror movies quite successfully, especially in the heart-stopping finale.Filmed on a budget of less than $1 million, The Blair Witch Project went on to gross over $248 million worldwide, earning it a world record for top budget to box office ratio. Such a huge success is a bright spot in the film's life, as it stands as one of the most inventive, as well as one of the most terrifying, movies of all time. With interesting lore, extremely well-done improvised acting by the trio of actors, and smart directing choices, The Blair Witch Project is sure to change your mind about the woods behind your house, and what may be lurking within.

And it is one of the best musical films that you will ever see.9\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Musical"},{"date":"29 June 2014","score":"","review":" This hilarious gorefest begins on Skull Island and I prefer this Skull Island to Jackson's King Kong Skull Island. It's here the rat-monkey is captured and hauled away to civilization, but not before a man is bit and subsequently chopped into pieces. Our pathetic mama's boy of a main character sees his overbearing and downright horrible mother get chomped on by the rat-monkey at the zoo and takes her home to where she will wreck havoc as a zombie. The tone is basically slapstick and despite what could be the most bloodletting ever in a film, Jackson keeps his material comedic. The last act of the film is gleefully ridiculous as a giant uninvited party at our lead Lionel's home becomes a show stopping display of gore and off the wall manic filmmaking. The film reaches a fever pitch that is so over the top, it basically erupts into crimson.
