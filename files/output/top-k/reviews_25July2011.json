[{"date":"25 July 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" THE THIN MAN (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1934), directed by W.S. Van Dyke, from the novel by Dashiell Hammett, is a classic mystery-comedy that helped establish the careers of both its leading performers, William Powell and Myrna Loy, Powell especially, in a performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination. There have been mystery-comedies prior to this, A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT (Allied, 1933) with Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot as rival news reporters that immediately comes to mind, but THE THIN MAN stands in a class by itself.With the plot set in New York City at the start of the Christmas season, the ten minute prologue begins with Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), an absent-minded inventor, who discovers that his secretary, Julia Wolfe (Natalie Moorehead), with whom he has been carrying on a romancer, has stolen $50,000 worth of government bonds he's been saving for the upcoming wedding of his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan) to Andrew (Henry Wadsworth). Wynant confronts Julia with his accusations, and after learning the truth, he angrily walks out of the apartment down the dark streets alone. The story gets underway as Wynant's ex-wife, Mimi (Minna Gombell), in desperate need of money, comes to visit Julia to learn of Wynant's whereabouts. After entering the apartment, she finds her dead. Before the police are called, Mimi takes something from Julia's hand belonging to Wynant, and withholds the item as possible evidence. As for Dorothy, she suspects something terribly wrong when her father, away on a secret trip unknown even to his personal attorney, Herbert McCauley (Porter Hall), hasn't returned in time for the wedding. She soon takes her worries to Nick Charles (William Powell), a friend of the family having a time of his life drinking cocktails in a speakeasy. Nick, a former detective visiting from San Francisco with his wealthy wife, Nora (Myrna Loy), is asked to investigate. At first Nick declines, but after three additional murders take place, linking it all to gray-haired thin man, Wynant, now missing for three months, Nick, at Nora's urging, comes out of his four years of carefree living to look into the case. Along with Lieutenant John Guild (Nat Pendleton) and his dog, Asta, Nick stumbles upon some clues while investigating in Wynant's workshop, to surprising and unexpected results.Suspects in question include William Henry as Wynant's studious intellectual son, Gilbert; Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgensen, a lazy loafer living off Mimi; and Julia's gangster acquaintances played by Edward Brophy (Joe Morelli); and Harold Huber (Nunheimer), the latter being murder victim number three. Then there's Bert Roach being the overgrown crybaby guest at the Christmas Eve party wanting to use Nick's phone to call his maw long distance.The success or failure for any motion picture relies simply on fine scripting (Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich) and perfect casting. THE THIN MAN succeeds on those counts and chemistry by Powell and Loy. Having already some detective experience to his name, that of Philo Vance on three separate occasions, The Canary Murder Case 1929); The Benson Murder Case (1930 and The Kennel Murder Case (1933), Powell's Nick Charles, unlike any other detective commonly found in motion picture mysteries, is very much witty, down to earth, and of course, married. Rather than typically presenting a detective sleuthing with a male counterpart as comedy relief, a gal reporter, or very much alone, Nick Charles is assisted by Asta, his wire-haired fox terrier. Observant and clever with his deductions, Nick Charles is also quick with his responses, a fondness for liquor and fun at parties. His friends are usually ex-cons whom he's sent up the river,holding no grudge against him. Myrna Loy has found her true character in Nora Charles. Breaking away from the stereotype bossy spouse, she accepts her husband for what and whom he is, and equals with his enjoyment of fun and mystery combined. Great scene captures her sitting on the couch gowned in fur coat calmly watching her husband being a little boy at heart playing with the sling shot he's gotten for Christmas, shooting away the ornaments hanging on the Christmas tree one by one. As much as Nora would prefer sleuthing with him during his investigations, she seldom gets that chance. The climatic finish where Nick summons all connected with the case at the dinner gathering is well constructed in both humor and suspense.The success of THE THIN MAN not only brought forth many imitations, but five additional sequels starring Powell and Loy, along with the basis of a 1957-59 television series starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk, but nothing to compare with the 1934 original, being the most famous and revived of all the Thin Man presentations combined.Distributed to video cassette as early as the 1980s by MGM Home Video enclosed in plastic clam shells, cable television presentations on the Disney Channel's Best of Hollywood in the 1990s, Turner Classic Movies from 1994 onward, and finally DVD where this and others continue to acquire both a new audience along with those who know who the killer is but to just simply want to watch over and over again in the manner of Nick and Nora Charles, just for the fun of it.

It's such a nice sounding word for what it means a fortunate accident.¨ I never thought the time would come in which I'd see this movie because unfortunately I had caught the ending on cable and therefore spoiled the rest of the film. However, I happened to come across Serendipity again and decided to watch it from the beginning this time, and what a pleasure it was. Even though I knew how the story was going to end, it was a delight to watch the story unravel. We know how these romantic movies are going to end most of the time, but the important thing is the story and the chemistry between the lead characters; and Serendipity didn't disappoint me. I was hooked from the very opening scene in the store, and there seemed to be something magical going on. It didn't matter whether or not I had seen the ending because the important thing was seeing this romantic story come to life. The chemistry between the two lead roles was really believable. It's as if I was destined to watch this movie the way I did so that I wouldn't focus so much on how predictable the movie might be, but rather enjoy the love story and the chemistry between the actors. The dialogue in this film, written by Marc Klein, was also great and there were several memorable lines. In my opinion this is by far Peter Chelsom's best film thanks to a great dual performance from John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale who really shine together on screen.It all happens one magical night Jonathan (John Cusack) is doing some Christmas shopping for his girlfriend and while grabbing the last remaining pair of black gloves he runs into Sara (Kate Beckinsale) who is also thinking of buying them for her lover. Being the gentleman he is Jonathan insists that Sarah take the gloves, but he can't help but feel some magical connection between them. They decide to share a drink together at Serendipity and they spend the night getting to know each other, although Sara never reveals her last name to him. She says that if they are meant to be together then fate will make them cross paths again. She writes her full name and phone number on a book cover (¨Love in the Time of Cholera¨) and says she will give it away to a used bookstore. If they are meant to be together then he will be able to find the book; Jonathan does the same thing on a five dollar bill. Unfortunately fate doesn't give them a hand at first and each goes their separate way. Seven years later Jonathan, who still lives in New York and works for ESPN, is about to get married with Halley (Bridget Moynahan). His best friend, Dean (Jeremy Piven), gives a funny speech on their engagement night, but Jonathan begins to see some signals that remind him of that magical night he shared with Sara. Meanwhile, Sara is living in California and is also about to get married with a New Age musician named Lars (John Corbett). She also begins to get cold feet about the wedding and begins to see some signs that remind her of the night she spent with Jonathan. She decides to travel to New York for the weekend with her best friend, Eve (Molly Shannon), and see if she can find information on Jonathan. Thus the plot thickens and the fun begins.The chemistry between Beckinsale and Cusack is just unbelievable. Those few scenes they share together at the beginning of the film are so magical that we want the two of them to find their way back together. Somehow we want to believe in fate and soul mates, and these two characters represent just that because we want them to be together even though they both seem to have good relationships with their partners, who don't play the typical bad boyfriend\/girlfriend character. The movie is not all romance; there are also several funny scenes Piven and Shannon have some memorable comedic scenes. Beckinsale is as beautiful as ever in this film, and Cusack is at his best playing this sort of charismatic role. The entire cast really shines in this film making this love story all that more believable. Serendipity is one of those few romantic Hollywood movies that actually works thanks to a great love story, good performances, and memorable dialogues. We all want to believe in love and how fate can give us a hand when it comes to finding our soul mate; and Serendipity works so well at getting this point across that it can turn the most skeptic person into a believer. It doesn't matter if the ending is predictable or not, the most important thing about Serendipity is how we get to that finale; learning how to read those signs and enjoying the love story. In my opinion Serendipity will rank among those great romantic films.http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"25 July 2011","score":"","review":" ¨Serendipity, it's one of my favorite words.

Unfortunately, many of them are quite bad, fortunately this isn't one of those. I hadn't got round to reading the book before seeing this, but I don't think that affected my enjoyment of it. King invents such great characters and this is a case in point, some really well rounded characters and a mystery thriller to boot! Who couldn't ask for more? Here's a brief summary before I give you my take on it.We begin with the death of Vera Donovan, a rich old lady who lived alone with her carer, Dolores Claiborne. We find Vera at the bottom of the stairs with Dolores standing beside her, arms raised with a heavy rolling pin in her hands. She expires before Dolores uses it, but on that evidence, it doesn't look good for her. In New York, Dolores has a daughter, Selena, a journalist, who is faxed a copy of a local news report about the case. She arrives in the small town on an island off the coast of Maine to find her mother at the police station. Detective John Mackey, who is running the investigation is keeping here there because the house she was living in, Vera's, is now a crime scene. Dolores decides to stay in her own house, the one she had shared with her abusive husband, Joe St. George and Selena, before he died many years before. Detective Mackey had investigated that death too, and had been suspicious that Dolores was responsible, but couldn't prove it. There is a lot of tension between Dolores and Selena, both have secrets. Secrets that are about to be revealed&#x85; I'll leave it there so them Spoiler Police don't try to throw me down a well or something.This is a very well made film that obviously had a decent budget. The sets and locations match the mood perfectly. I admit I was a little disappointed at how dull it all looked at first, but I soon realised that all of the flashback scenes, and there's quite a few of those, are all in vivid colour. As far as performances go, well I can't fault Kathy Bates as Dolores Claiborne, she hardly put a foot wrong, a masterful performance! Jennifer Jason Leigh also put in a good turn as Selena St. George, as did Judy Parfitt as Vera Donovan. I should also mention Christopher Plummer as Detective John Mackey and David Strathairn as Joe St. George, both also put in fine performances. John C. Reilly had a minor role as Const. Frank Stamshaw and finally a special mention for Ellen Muth, who did an excellent job as Young Selena in some of the flashback scenes.I really enjoyed this film with its intriguing characters and a plot that always keeps you guessing. It has quite a slow pace and is quite melodramatic, but I didn't mind that particularly, I was more interested in the characters and the plot. If I have one criticism, it is that it is a little too long and, because of this, it does seem to drag on a bit towards the end. Over all though, a film I very much enjoyed and one I can recommend to you.My Score 8.4\/10 IMDb Score 7.3\/10 (14,832 votes when this review was written).

As far as performances go, well I can't fault Kathy Bates as Dolores Claiborne, she hardly put a foot wrong, a masterful performance! Jennifer Jason Leigh also put in a good turn as Selena St. George, as did Judy Parfitt as Vera Donovan. I should also mention Christopher Plummer as Detective John Mackey and David Strathairn as Joe St. George, both also put in fine performances. John C. Reilly had a minor role as Const. Frank Stamshaw and finally a special mention for Ellen Muth, who did an excellent job as Young Selena in some of the flashback scenes.I really enjoyed this film with its intriguing characters and a plot that always keeps you guessing. It has quite a slow pace and is quite melodramatic, but I didn't mind that particularly, I was more interested in the characters and the plot. If I have one criticism, it is that it is a little too long and, because of this, it does seem to drag on a bit towards the end. Over all though, a film I very much enjoyed and one I can recommend to you.My Score 8.4\/10 IMDb Score 7.3\/10 (14,832 votes when this review was written).

Unfortunately, many of them are quite bad, fortunately this isn't one of those. I hadn't got round to reading the book before seeing this, but I don't think that affected my enjoyment of it. King invents such great characters and this is a case in point, some really well rounded characters and a mystery thriller to boot! Who couldn't ask for more? Here's a brief summary before I give you my take on it.We begin with the death of Vera Donovan, a rich old lady who lived alone with her carer, Dolores Claiborne. We find Vera at the bottom of the stairs with Dolores standing beside her, arms raised with a heavy rolling pin in her hands. She expires before Dolores uses it, but on that evidence, it doesn't look good for her. In New York, Dolores has a daughter, Selena, a journalist, who is faxed a copy of a local news report about the case. She arrives in the small town on an island off the coast of Maine to find her mother at the police station. Detective John Mackey, who is running the investigation is keeping here there because the house she was living in, Vera's, is now a crime scene. Dolores decides to stay in her own house, the one she had shared with her abusive husband, Joe St. George and Selena, before he died many years before. Detective Mackey had investigated that death too, and had been suspicious that Dolores was responsible, but couldn't prove it. There is a lot of tension between Dolores and Selena, both have secrets. Secrets that are about to be revealed&#x85; I'll leave it there so them Spoiler Police don't try to throw me down a well or something.This is a very well made film that obviously had a decent budget. The sets and locations match the mood perfectly.

The movie, despite being in black & white, appears strikingly refreshing both to the eyes and the intellect. Primarily remembered as John Huston's directorial debut, the movie played a decisive role in giving Film-Noire its true identity as a genre. The Maltese Falcon also gave Humphrey Bogart his highly deserved super-stardom that had hitherto eluded him. Huston creates an environment of suspicion, doubt and uncertainty that is so convoluted that even Hitchcock would be proud of it. The movie has multiple layers of mystery and suspense that keeps the viewer engaged throughout. Sam Spade is a private detective who runs an agency with his partner Miles Archer. An ostensibly naive lady, Miss Wanderly offers them a task to pursue a man, Floyd Thursby, who has allegedly run off with her younger sister. The over-simplicity of task arouses Spade's suspicion, but Wanderly's lucrative offer makes the duo overlook it initially. Miles is killed during the pursuit and the police inform Spade of the mishap. Spade only discreetly tells the police that Miles was after a man named Thursby without disclosing anything about Miss Wandely. The police soon find Thursby dead as well and suspect Spade for killing him in an act of revenge. Soon Miles Archer's widow shows up at Spade's office and insinuates of her romantic involvement with Spade, who shuns her away after she tries to incriminate him for the murder. The police come across an anonymous lead and begin suspecting Spade for killing his partner, Miles. The plot thickens with the entry a couple of obscure characters including Joel Cairo, who happens be an acquaintance of Miss Wanderly. He is in pursuit of a highly precious, antique, gold statuette of Maltese Falcon and offers Spade five grands to help him find it. A game of cat and mouse soon ensues, between the various stake holders, which becomes deadlier as the stakes are raised. Humphrey Bogart perfectly fits into the shoes of Spade&#x97;a sleek and sharp sleuth&#x97;and makes it his own in a manner that only someone of his grit and caliber could. Bogart is in top form right from the inception to the finale, stealing the spotlight in almost every scene that is he is part of. Bogart could only demonstrate his prodigious talent and acting prowess in short bursts during his long B movie stint in which he was mostly type-casted as a gangster. The Maltese Falcon was Bogart's big break after years of anticipation and he didn't leave a single stone unturned to prove his mettle. Bogart shows his class and stamps his authority as a performer during the portrayal of Spade he is ever so quick-witted thanks to his sublime articulacy and his prowess at repartee seems unparalleled; the inherent cynicism in Spade and the perspicacity with which he operates soon became Bogart's trademark and catapulted him to super-stardom. Many regard Bogart's performance in Casablanca as his absolute best, but I rate his portrayal of Spade second only to his supernal portrayal of Dobbs in The Treasure of Sierre Madre, where he took acting to hitherto unattainable and unforeseeable heights. John Huston uses the Midas touch he had as a screenwriter to strike all the right cords in his directorial debut. Almost everyone in the supporting cast gives a memorable performance with special mention of Peter Lorre as the deceptive Joel Cairo, Sydney Greenstreet as the witty yet dangerous Kasper Gutman and Mary Astor as the scheming Brigid O' Shaughnessy. The taut plot of the movie, which is masterfully adapted from the novel of the same name by Huston himself, is well complemented by the impressively written dialogs that are delivered with an equal prowess. Amidst the everlasting suspense the movie has an obvious undertone of dark humor that adds great value to the movie. The cinematography undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the time.The Maltese Falcon is not merely a Noire masterpiece but also a testament to the true spirit of cinema that has kept itself alive despite decades of relentless mutilation and sabotage in the name of commercial movie-making. Despite being devoid of modern-day gimmicks the movie is incredibly high on suspense and holds the viewer in a vice-like grip throughout its runtime. It's a real shame that movies like these are seldom made these days. The tone of the movie is such that it makes suspense thrillers of today appear like kids cartoon. PS. The movie is an ode to Bogart, Huston and all those who made it a reality. It's suspense cinema at its absolute best with a completely different treatment to themes propagated by the likes of Hitchcock. It's a must for all the Bogart fans worldwide, and absolutely essential for all those who have a penchant for Film-Noire as a genre. 10\/10http\/\/www.apotpourriofvestiges.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"25 July 2011","score":"30 out of 35 people found the following review useful","review":" Seven decades have passed but the suspense and thrill of The Maltese Falcon still reign supreme.

One was Rising Sun, a messy wasted potential of a movie, the other was Disclosure, a zeitgeist snatcher that seized the moment. The topic, and the novelty of flipping the gender aggressor, was always going to make Disclosure of much interest, thus the film and the novel made big money aided still further by the hot casting of Douglas and Moore, who were still draw cards in the early 90s. Crichton, after being displeased with other adaptations of his work, got big say on the screenplay as a written project.

There's a trio of interesting and differing female characters at the front of the narrative, even if Moore's stair-master vixen isn't exactly developed beyond being a bitch, and the virtual reality sequences have an appealing charm about them. The cast are turning in good ones, with a notable shout out to Caroline Goodall who wisely underplays it as the wife.

Substituting the old, hoary clichés were films about Mankind's past, present and future. One such film of this kind was, ironically enough, a film that marked the directing debut of 2001's principal special effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull--SILENT RUNNING. Done on a fairly modest budget of just slightly over $1 million, SILENT RUNNING inevitably will seem dated to some after four decades; its message, however, remains all too timely.Set in a far distant future, where Earth's ecology has become a permanent train wreck, SILENT RUNNING generally takes place in the deepest and most isolated part of the Solar System onboard the American Airlines-sponsored deep-space freighter Valley Forge, which houses three different types of what is left of Earth's greenery in geodesic domes, all of which are tended to by a very dedicated scientist (Bruce Dern). But then comes the news that Valley Forge is being ordered back to Earth; and while that prospect pleases Dern's three human cohorts (Cliff Potts; Ron Rifkin; Jesse Vint), the fact that part of those orders also include nuking the geodesic domes and the remaining plant and animal life doesn't sit at all well with Dern. With the help of two drone robots, and even after Potts, Rifkin, and Vint blow two of the three domes up, Dern takes control of the 2000 foot-long freighter, leaving the one remaining domed example of Earth life attached to the main body of the ship, and putting the ship on a course that will take it around the planet Saturn and its glorious ring system and back to Earth. Having jettisoned his human companions, who showed utter indifference to the conservation project from the beginning, he then instructs the drones in how to maintain these last remnants of Earth life.Having achieved a lot as a special effects supervisor, first on 2001 and then on THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN in 1970-71, Trumbull managed to wangle his way into the director's chair for Silent Running, which was loosely based on an idea he himself had written a treatment for just after 2001 and which then was shaped into a screenplay by Deric Washburn, Mike Cimino (later to direct the 1978 Vietnam War epic THE DEER HUNTER), and Steven Bochco. The elaborate nature of the story, dealing with futuristic ecology and conservation, would seem to have been hemmed in by the film's rather low budget and a shooting schedule of just over a month; but Trumbull managed to pull this off by shooting all of SILENT RUNNING on location, both on the real-life, decommissioned aircraft carrier Valley Forge in Long Beach and at a hangar at Van Nuys Municipal Airport in the spring of 1971. Trumbull also had the task, of course, of supervising the special effects, along with good friends Richard Yuricich and John Dykstra (both of whom he would reunite with on STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE), and, given the relative paucity of the budget, they still managed to work. As this is also a character-driven piece, it is up to Dern to largely carry the film as the ambitious botanist; and while his penchant for vituperative acting erupts at times, he does a solid job of playing somebody who is not an over-the-top nut case.

One such film of this kind was, ironically enough, a film that marked the directing debut of 2001's principal special effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull--SILENT RUNNING. Done on a fairly modest budget of just slightly over $1 million, SILENT RUNNING inevitably will seem dated to some after four decades; its message, however, remains all too timely.Set in a far distant future, where Earth's ecology has become a permanent train wreck, SILENT RUNNING generally takes place in the deepest and most isolated part of the Solar System onboard the American Airlines-sponsored deep-space freighter Valley Forge, which houses three different types of what is left of Earth's greenery in geodesic domes, all of which are tended to by a very dedicated scientist (Bruce Dern). But then comes the news that Valley Forge is being ordered back to Earth; and while that prospect pleases Dern's three human cohorts (Cliff Potts; Ron Rifkin; Jesse Vint), the fact that part of those orders also include nuking the geodesic domes and the remaining plant and animal life doesn't sit at all well with Dern. With the help of two drone robots, and even after Potts, Rifkin, and Vint blow two of the three domes up, Dern takes control of the 2000 foot-long freighter, leaving the one remaining domed example of Earth life attached to the main body of the ship, and putting the ship on a course that will take it around the planet Saturn and its glorious ring system and back to Earth. Having jettisoned his human companions, who showed utter indifference to the conservation project from the beginning, he then instructs the drones in how to maintain these last remnants of Earth life.Having achieved a lot as a special effects supervisor, first on 2001 and then on THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN in 1970-71, Trumbull managed to wangle his way into the director's chair for Silent Running, which was loosely based on an idea he himself had written a treatment for just after 2001 and which then was shaped into a screenplay by Deric Washburn, Mike Cimino (later to direct the 1978 Vietnam War epic THE DEER HUNTER), and Steven Bochco. The elaborate nature of the story, dealing with futuristic ecology and conservation, would seem to have been hemmed in by the film's rather low budget and a shooting schedule of just over a month; but Trumbull managed to pull this off by shooting all of SILENT RUNNING on location, both on the real-life, decommissioned aircraft carrier Valley Forge in Long Beach and at a hangar at Van Nuys Municipal Airport in the spring of 1971. Trumbull also had the task, of course, of supervising the special effects, along with good friends Richard Yuricich and John Dykstra (both of whom he would reunite with on STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE), and, given the relative paucity of the budget, they still managed to work. As this is also a character-driven piece, it is up to Dern to largely carry the film as the ambitious botanist; and while his penchant for vituperative acting erupts at times, he does a solid job of playing somebody who is not an over-the-top nut case.

Essentially, the film imagines what a top-secret spy's domestic life would be like. Harry Tasker loves his wife, Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), but he lies through his teeth to her all the time; kind of hard to avoid when some days you're trying to make it home from Switzerland in time for dinner.True Lies opens in pure James Bond fashion. Harry swims his way into a well-guarded estate where a party is being held, rips off his wetsuit to reveal a tuxedo and walks in to the mansion where he pretends to know everyone and then steals some key files related to potential Middle East terrorists. His escape involves explosions, a chase down a mountainside with bad guys on snowmobiles and skis and a license to kill. Schwarzenegger manages to exude some suave here and continues to prove why he was simply born an action hero.Tasker works for Omega Sector, self-touted as the last line of defense. They're basically the CIA. Tasker works closely with Albert (Tom Arnold), kind of his intel guy and a dry-humored pessimist. They're hardly the best duo of the '80s\/'90s, but they're different. Together, they go after terrorists.The film has a distinct three-act structure. The first introduces spy Harry and Omega Sector and develops the terrorist plot. The second starts when Harry tries to make up for never being home and discovers that his wife is meeting some kind of mystery man, which spins into something absurd. That diversion really kills the film by making it seem schizophrenic until the third act brings it all together and ups the stakes tremendously and in redeeming fashion. Cameron's a gift action director, but the film walks a weird line between action and humor. Much of the humor works, but the second-act, which houses most of it, goes on for too long. There are memorable moments with Harry and a used-car salesman and most famously Jamie Lee Curtis doing a little dance in lingerie, but those seem much better in retrospect once you've seen the entire film.

I could not totally commit myself into the narrative, judging by De Niro's character Rodrigo, since killing his brother during an unexpected duel, until the redemption in the midway, the performance is paper-thin and maybe director Roland Joffé didn't intend to dig into a deeper ground to elaborate on his character, which is a common measurement here, only Ray McAnally survives as the Cardinal Aktanurabo, not an arresting role, but the late McAnally owns every scene he presents.

Some older movies, such as Alien or E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial for example, are much more appealing to modern audiences. This being said, I still do appreciate some 80s Carpenter movies, and Starman was entertaining enough, although somewhat silly in it's execution. I don't know if it looked silly to audiences back when it was released (I was minus 2 years old in the making at the time), but my feeling is that if it were screened today in 2011, audiences would laugh at many parts of the movie. Starman does have an intended comedic element, since the visitor obviously struggles with cultural misunderstandings which leads to awkward situations, yet I believe modern audiences would more likely laugh at the ridiculousness of it, and not because it's clever comedy.Starman was released two years after Spielberg's E.T., and follows loosely the same plot. A friendly extraterrestrial comes to earth and is helped to go home (he'll die if he stays) by one or more initially frightened humans, while the aggressive government and military want to capture him. The fact that Starman seems to plagiarize E.T. can't be a held against it, since the scripts for both movies were written at the same time. Unfortunately for Starman, E.T. is a much superior movie, whether it is in plot, acting, suspense or wonder.Karen Allen is both beautiful and simple, thus she fits perfectly for her role as a lonely and sensitive widow. Her acting is sufficiently good, not praise-worthy, but very acceptable. Jeff Bridges was nominated for an Oscar for best actor with his role as the extraterrestrial, and honestly, I don't see why. I think Bridges is a phenomenal actor, and he played his role accordingly in Starman, which means he stays pretty much passive throughout the story, with a few eccentricities when he tries to imitate human facial expressions. Thus his role wasn't difficult in my opinion, and was certainly playable by any low-level actor. Hence the Oscar nomination for such an easy role is surprising to me.One particularly interesting and original moment in Starman is at the beginning, when the extraterrestrial transforms into human form by imitating (cloning) the DNA from a man's lock of hair which was kept by the man's widow (Allen). In front of a terrified widow, the extraterrestrial progressively (monstrously) grows from the shape of a baby to a fully adult and naked Jeff Bridges, this in a matter of minutes. I thought that was pretty cool since it looked fairly good and the idea of it is somewhat unsettling.Starman as a whole is very watchable and entertaining, but lacks in originality and atmosphere, which explains, I guess, why it didn't really stand the test of time and stays relatively overlooked when it comes to 80s sci-fi movies.

It was a tough sell to studios back in the 1960s, not only was the premise that formed Pierre Boulle's novel a tricky one, but the technical aspects, cost and quality of, also had the men in suits backing away from producer Arthur P. Jacobs and beefcake actor Charlton Heston. Eventually Dick Zanuck over at Fox nervously agreed to make it as long as significant tests ensured that farce would not follow. Stumping up $50,000 for John Chambers to develop the ape make up and masks, and a successful test run acted out by Edward G. Robinson as Dr Zaius opposite Heston, Planet of the Apes was given the green light. The script went through a number of changes as Serling and Wilson tossed around ideas to improve on Boulle's page turner-Heston himself felt that the novel as written was unfilmable-and when director Schaffner came on board, he himself went for a more primitive ape world as opposed to the one under consideration that featured futuristic high rises and super advanced technology. What came out at the end of it all is one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time.What would follow the success of the film is well known, a number of inferior sequels, a TV series, a remake and even a prequel in 2011. Then of course there was the toys, models, comics, cartoons and T shirts; it at times felt in the 70s that there really was a Planet of the Apes, only this one was driven by commerce. The aftermath of the original film has not done it any favours, the lines have become blurred, with so much muck and tack about, it often gets forgotten just how clinically great Schaffner's movie is.

Olivia deHavilland was superb here, as well, although she had many fine roles in her career. Thomas Mitchell is excellent as Pa, even more so after he lost his mind...the best role of his career. And then there are the supporting actors who lend something special to this film -- Aunt Pittypat (Laura Hope Crews in a classic role), Hattie McDaniels, Butterfly McQueen, and a long time favorite -- Harry Davenport.Dr. Zhivago and Ben-Hur are 9s, but GWTH is still the gold standard!

War is organic, you feel it, you smell it, breath it, the nose drown in an ocean of dirty mud, and praying your divine power that it would be quick, while watching the guts of your friend splattering in your uniform or a strident gurgle piercing your ears. During the film, two soldiers discuss which death would be less painful, as each one examines the effect of a bayonet, gas or a gunshot in the body. Speak about torment, fear or anguish, we're scared because whatever we're taught in class, in catechism, in history, we're afraid to leave the Earth, because we're afraid to live our body. We don't care for the other, this is OUR country, but this is MY body, and it makes a whole lot difference in the Army when the individual doesn't count, one death is tragic, one thousand is statistics. In one scene, one of the three soldiers condemned for 'cowardice in the face of the enemy', envies the cockroach that'll still be alive on the day he'll be dead, his unfortunate companion stamps on the insect, to give him 'the edge' not realizing that he just 'killed to make a point', his own condition in microcosm.So, talk about courage, about heroism, these are such great words, but ultimately, while facing death, even the bravest man can collapse and bawl like a little girl.

There are moments when both the real and the pretend are quite thrilling, but they end up detracting from each other so much the film is left flatfooted at its conclusion. Based on a novel by Richard Harris, too many essential details of the book are awkwardly crammed in during the last half hour. Watching Enigma is like taking an enjoyable car ride but then realizing you're late and rushing the final few miles to your destination.The historical aspect of the tale concerns the small group of British geniuses enlisted to crack the Nazi's infamous Enigma code. As the movie begins, the Germans have changed the code and left the British completely in the dark just as three huge supply convoys set out from the U.S. to Britain. The codebreakers have 4 days to crack Enigma to prevent U-boats from destroying one or all of those convoys.The fictional element of the story is Thomas Jericho (Dougray Scott), the leading genius among the codebreakers who's returned to work after a stint in an asylum. The intense but halting Jericho fell in love with the beautiful and mysterious Claire (Saffron Burrows), who drove him to a nervous breakdown when she sought out and then spurned his advances. Jericho is still obsessed with Claire, but finds she's disappeared without a trace or explanation. In his efforts to discover what happens to Clarie, Jericho is ably assisted by the almost irresistibly cute and spunky Hester Wallace (Kate Winslet), a secretary at the codebreakers' military base. Jericho is also confounded and harassed by Wigram (Jeremy Northram), a smilingly hard British intelligence agent who has multiple agendas.Both parts of Enigma are fairly good on their own merits, though the struggle to solve the Nazi code and win the war is understandably more compelling than the mystery of a missing woman, no matter how involved it may be. The difficulty is that by splitting its attention, the movie is never able to fully commit to either piece of itself. Though Enigma admirably tries to weave the two together and have them mirror each other, the on screen time spent with each dilemma inevitably gives short shrift to the other. As a viewer, you want to spend more time with the codebreakers AND you want to spend more time with the slowing budding romance of Jericho and Hester AND you want to spend more time on the conflicts between the intellectual men of science and the practical men of war AND you want to spend more time with the subtly blunt confrontations of Jericho and Wigram AND you want to spend more time with Jericho's memories of Claire. This is a case where you're left wanting more, but it's not a pleasant sensation.And as Enigma winds to a finish and the story starts throwing new things at you to set up and explain its big ending, it confirms the imbalance you've been feeling is the real product of a script that needed some things cut out and other things expanded to take their place.While legitimate, that complaint should not distract from the reality that this is a pretty good and entertaining production. It's well acted, well directed and the individual scenes are well written. While not a modern classic of the WWI genre, it's well worth it to spend a couple hours wrapped up in this Enigma.

Partly that's because its descendants and imitators have grown more and more cartoonish over the years. Partly that's because it represents a sort of cinema storytelling that's been subsumed by cultural and economic changes. Partly its because John Carpenter was so excited to have a decent budget to work with that he was damn sure it was all going to get shown on screen, even if it tended to slow the action down to a crawl. But if you're not a member of today's ADHD movie going audience, this is still a pretty cool flick.In the far flung future of 1997, New York City has been transformed into a giant prison surrounded by a 50 foot high concrete wall. For years, prisoners have been dumped inside and left to fend for themselves while the U.S. Police Force stands guard on the perimeter. The unavoidable complaints of the ACLU apparently don't bother anyone, but the crash of Air Force One inside the city does. Police Commissioner Hauck (Lee Van Cleef) mounts a rescue mission, only to find the President (Donald Pleasance) has been taken prisoner by the Duke of New York (Isaac Hayes).Unable to launch a direct assault without risking the President's life, Hauck send legendary outlaw Snake Plissken (Kurt Russel) into the prison to retrieve the President and a tape cassette of nuclear secrets. If Snake doesn't get the job done in 22 hours so the President can address a summit meeting with Russia and China, tiny explosives in his neck will go off and kill him. With the help of an old partner who now calls himself Brain (Harry Dean Stanton), Brain's girlfriend (Adrienne Barbeau) and a cabbie (Ernest Borgnine) who's way too happy-go-lucky for a guy who's been living inside a violent hellhole of murder and deprivation, Snake has to battle his way through sewer crazies, the Duke's army of thugs and pro wrestler Ox Baker to save himself, the President and the United States. Of course, Snake isn't really all that interested in saving those last two.As I mentioned, there are three basic problems with Escape From New York and only one of them has anything to do with the movie itself.First, even though this is a sci-fi, dystopic action film, it was made at a time when even these sorts of dramas were expected to adhere as close to reality as possible. So, Snake Plissken isn't some superhuman killing machine who slaughters scores of people while making clever quips and sprinting headlong from one kinetic madhouse of violence to another. He mainly sneaks around superior forces and has only one really big fight scene. The whole thing is rather restrained by modern standards, especially for such an over the top premise.Secondly, this film reflects and projects 1970's attitudes about urban decay and societal disintegration that don't resonate all that well after decades of gentrification and falling crime rates. Oddly enough, some viewers might still respond to the surface politics of the story, but I don't believe it can truly connect in a deeper, instinctual way as it could in the early 80s.Thirdly, director John Carpenter wanted every single person who watched Escape From New York to notice the wonderful and expansive scenery that he could afford when he made it. You can understand why a guy from the world of low budget filmmaking would get caught up in that, but the advances in special effects have eliminated how impressive such scenes would have been to people who had never seen that sort of thing in this sort of movie. Now, it only seems like the camera lingers for an excessively long time on the desolate appearance of the Big Apple circa 1997.On the positive side, this film is a lot like Highlander. Even with its flaws, it creates an incredibly interesting reality populated with compelling characters. If it had been made a few years later when the infrastructure of geek culture was more established, this thing might have spawned an immediate series of sequels and a long running TV show, instead of a big budget sequel too long delayed to have any relevance to the cultural zeitgeist.Snake Plissken is cool.

Tinman is a human tin without a heart, though is still sentimental and compassionate. The Cowardly Lion is a hilarious Lion who's...well, a coward. And The Wicked Witch is a symbol of childhood fears. Man I remember how much she scared me when I was a child. That black attire, green skin and cackling voice would have kids running for their moms. What else is there to say. The music is done very well and the musical numbers are great. My favorite is when the lion sings about what his life would be if he had the nerve to become king of the forest. Then there's one of the most memorable songs ,sung by Judy Garland, that will live in all our hearts and never be forgotten from time to time.This film will go on and on for generations to come. If you have kids of your own, give yourself the time to introduce this film, they might have the same effect for their childhoods as ours did. If I have kids, this will be the first film I will introduce them to. It's a timeless gem that will never grow old, it's one of my all-time favorite films. One of the best movies ever made.
