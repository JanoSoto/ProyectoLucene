Based on the letters of the lead character, Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) of the Federal Army during the American Civil War volunteered to lead the first company of black soldiers. In this company included Shaw's right hand, Maj. Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), Sgt. Maj. John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman), Pvt. Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy), and of course, Pvt. Trip (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Denzel Washington). Shaw was forced to deal with prejudices from both the enemy (who had orders to kill commanding officers of blacks), and of his own fellow officers. Also starring Andre Braugher as Cpl. Thomas Searles, John Finn as Sgt. Maj. Mulcahy, Donovan Leitch as Capt. Charles Fessenden Morse, John David Cullum as Henry Sturgis Russell, Alan North as Gov. John Albion Andrew, Cliff De Young as Col. James M. Montgomery, Bob Gunton as Gen. Charles Garrison Harker and Jane Alexander as Sarah Blake Sturgis Shaw. Broderick's performance may be slightly woody, but its still substantial, Freeman and Washington obviously have no problem proving themselves worthy actors, and Washington certainly deserved his Oscar. The battle scenes are all very watchable, and the premise of the film is very appealing to see the history of who was allowed to fight in future wars change. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score for James Horner and Best Screenplay. Denzel Washington was number 28, and Morgan Freeman number 27 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Washington was also number 40 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 68 on The 100 Greatest War Films, and it was number 31 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers.

Well, try this one on for size, the most beloved icon of 80's B-cinema, and, not to mention, Lloyd Kaufman's first good idea. This is The Toxic Avenger.The Only super-hero, before, or since, that isn't completely ridiculous. This is exactly what Troma needed in the mid-80's, not necessarily a super-hero, but just edgier films, in general. Although, within a decade's time, for Troma, edgy would lead to seriously out of control, but, that's another story.This epic begins in a health club, in Tromaville, N.J. Melvin Ferd is a 98 pound mop boy, who appears to be slightly retarded, as opposed to just being a scrawny nerd, but, I suppose, retarded-looking was all Lloyd could find. Accident prone Melvin has recently got under the skin of the town bad boy, Bozo, and his posse, a foursome that takes great (drunken) pleasure in running over small children, and minorities, so, you know little Melvin is in for it. Bozo, Slug, Julie, and Wanda all put their heads together to concoct the most diabolical scheme in B-cinema history. Get this, Julie convinces Melvin that she has a crush on him, and will act on this, but, only if Melvin puts on a pink tutu, and meets her by the pool, where it happens to be dark. Once this happens, the lights are turned on, poor Melvin is mortified to find half of Tromaville pointing, and laughing at the fact that he is holding, and showing his affection for a sheep. The poor little guy is chased out of the building, out the window, into a barrel of Toxic Waste, that was only there because it was such a nice spot for using cocaine.Julie I think he's in trouble!.Bozo Julie, this guy, if he can't take a joke, he stinks!with Melvin's skin now sizzling, and gradually catching fire, the poor little fellow runs home, takes a hot bath after a long day at work, and transforms into The Toxic Avenger, the first, and (apparently) the last super-hero not targeted towards 5 year olds. And now, it's on. Now is the time to make them all pay!! Not only the tormentors, but, all of those in Tromaville, who are evil, and that's a lot of evil . Now is the time to restore peace in Tromaville!! Perhaps, the only reason our beloved Troma exists today. Toxie really put these guys on the map. The Toxic Avenger contains many scenes of extreme gore, and cruelty, which would, eventually, become Troma's trademark, that would set the standard for B-cinema in the coming years. Toxie has spawned three sequels (with one on the way), Beware of the first two, although, they really should be viewed, just so that you get your mind fully blown while viewing part four, but I'm just saying, beware. Like many Troma's after it, Toxie focuses, mainly, on entertaining us, and not on meaningless issues, like continuity, or passable acting. Forget about it, The Toxic Avenger is pure entertainment. As we all know, The 60's gave us Blood Feast, the 70's gave us Pink Flamingos, and in a decade where mainstream garbage like John Rambo, and Jason Vorheese were shoved down our throats, we, the Troma universe know who the real icon is.

Sadly for him he lands right in the middle of Manhattan Island, when an armed unit lands inside the walls they are told that the president has been taken hostage and they must get out of their prison ASAP. At a loss what to do, the authorities decide to send one man in alone, ex war hero turned criminal, Snake Plissken, not only does he have to contend with surviving the incredibly hostile prison, he also has a time bomb implanted in his body that, should he not get the president out safely within 24 hours, will explode and mean no more Snake Plissken!.Made in 1981 and set in 1997, it's safe to say John Carpenter is not the best predictor of the future around. However his vision of a future where America has thrown all it's criminals on one island, where they create their own society out of harms way, has to rank as an incredibly adroit piece of work. This place is grim and deadly, the flotsam and jetsam of society thrust together in this bleak and desolate place of class separation. What Carpenter has achieved with his usual minimal budget allowance is a smouldering sci-fi classic that may be as daft as they come, but it pulses with cool and cheekily slaps you round the face with its cheeky satirical edginess. I must give kudos at this point to the great production design from Joe Alves, who along with Carpenter has crafted this brilliantly dirty netherworld of crime.Our anti-hero of the piece, Snake Plissken, is superbly played by Kurt Russell, the original choice interestingly was Tommy Lee Jones, but Russell fuels Plissken's mantra to make him one of the eighties coolest grumpy bastards!, and his work here is first class in terms of the films apocalyptic structure. Surroundning Russell is a wealth of quality performers each adding their personal bits to this tick-tock stew, Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasance, Harry Dean Stanton, Adrienne Barbeau and Isaac Hayes all earn their money and flesh out the story to the end.Calling Escape From New York an action picture would be setting first time viewers up for a real let down, what action there is is minimal but highly effective, the machismo flourishes acting more as a point of reference to the pictures time bomb urgency. I like to think of the film as more a sci-fi adventure yarn laced with darkly comic humour, with of course machismo thrown in as a side salad to accentuate the bleakness of it all, wonderful. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 October 2008","score":"29 out of 34 people found the following review useful","review":" It's 1997 and Manhattan Island is a walled off prison, during the flight of Air Force One, the president's plane is taken over by a terrorist and the president ejects out in the safety pod.

Surroundning Russell is a wealth of quality performers each adding their personal bits to this tick-tock stew, Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasance, Harry Dean Stanton, Adrienne Barbeau and Isaac Hayes all earn their money and flesh out the story to the end.Calling Escape From New York an action picture would be setting first time viewers up for a real let down, what action there is is minimal but highly effective, the machismo flourishes acting more as a point of reference to the pictures time bomb urgency. I like to think of the film as more a sci-fi adventure yarn laced with darkly comic humour, with of course machismo thrown in as a side salad to accentuate the bleakness of it all, wonderful. 9\/10 ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"16 October 2008","score":"29 out of 34 people found the following review useful","review":" It's 1997 and Manhattan Island is a walled off prison, during the flight of Air Force One, the president's plane is taken over by a terrorist and the president ejects out in the safety pod. Sadly for him he lands right in the middle of Manhattan Island, when an armed unit lands inside the walls they are told that the president has been taken hostage and they must get out of their prison ASAP. At a loss what to do, the authorities decide to send one man in alone, ex war hero turned criminal, Snake Plissken, not only does he have to contend with surviving the incredibly hostile prison, he also has a time bomb implanted in his body that, should he not get the president out safely within 24 hours, will explode and mean no more Snake Plissken!.Made in 1981 and set in 1997, it's safe to say John Carpenter is not the best predictor of the future around. However his vision of a future where America has thrown all it's criminals on one island, where they create their own society out of harms way, has to rank as an incredibly adroit piece of work. This place is grim and deadly, the flotsam and jetsam of society thrust together in this bleak and desolate place of class separation.

Thornton's character seems to hold a mysterious strength to remain optimistic about his future even when his past holds no evidence of increased success around the next corner. I really liked Fargo and have to compare this Coen Brothers production to what I think was a very entertaining movie through to the end. I also kept wishing the movie was in color (similar to the Aviator) even if very muted, and feel the significant extra effort could have been worthwhile & innovative.Although I can appreciate experimenting with script ideas, I was disappointed with the ending of this story just as with No Country for Old Men, because I enjoyed the rest of both movies. I would like to see a return to a more traditional (Fargo style) endings, because I can't see this flat, pointless ending style ever living up to the rest of the story. Even the Fargo ending was a stretch with a pregnant Margie approaching a secluded house alone with potentially two cold blooded killers inside, and armed with only a .38, but it was within the realm of possibility and somehow put the killers in their place as common criminals, while Margie just did her job. Film noir usually ends with some form of justice, even if the hero is not better off than where he started. Thornton's character was neither very heroic or very guilty, just a regular bored guy who tried to gain some justice for himself in a convoluted way, but never deserved the death penalty he was dealt.In this case, I want to root for the movie, but I do not get any satisfaction from finding that, in the end, any sense of justice is denied, ignored, or completely fouled up. The ending seems truncated in a strange place, that feels very wrong and flat to me, instead of adding a convincing life is never fair element that I think was the goal. For most of the viewers, the facts that life is not fair and boring much of the time, is not news, and what we are trying to escape thinking about for a couple of hours.

Thornton's character seems to hold a mysterious strength to remain optimistic about his future even when his past holds no evidence of increased success around the next corner. I really liked Fargo and have to compare this Coen Brothers production to what I think was a very entertaining movie through to the end. I also kept wishing the movie was in color (similar to the Aviator) even if very muted, and feel the significant extra effort could have been worthwhile & innovative.Although I can appreciate experimenting with script ideas, I was disappointed with the ending of this story just as with No Country for Old Men, because I enjoyed the rest of both movies. I would like to see a return to a more traditional (Fargo style) endings, because I can't see this flat, pointless ending style ever living up to the rest of the story.

It's almost impossible to grasp how could such a gaffe occur on such a well produced project. Obviously, whoever was in charge was asleep at the wheel, and then they dropped the ball.Too bad, because the movie in its first 30 - 40 minutes promised top-notch entertainment. The dialogs were witty and pithy, the acting was right on the money, the pace was brisk and airtight. Alas, all that fell by the wayside the moment the movie turned into a romance- wannabe. The main female protagonist is as sexy as a cold dead fish, and the aging male protagonists (Grant) is barely plodding along.Another huge opportunity missed. Anyway, watch it for the opening 40 minutes, enjoy the excellent cabaret music in the pass the orange sequence, and then push the eject button.
