It's still a 3-character film that revolves around the same setting--most of the time.  But when you see great acting like this, how can you complain??  Dustin Hoffman is great at whatever he does, and he's perfectly believable as the foul-mouthed Teach.  He has some of the greatest lines.  My favorite is Guys like that, I'd like to f**k their wives.  He is rude and obnoxious with barely a sympathetic quality, but he's the guy you love to hate.  I just recently started watching NYPD Blue and just from watching a few episodes, I can say that Dennis Franz is one of the best actors I've ever seen.  He deserves to be on the big screen a lot more, because he has abilities as an actor that only few TV actors also possess.  He delivers every line and every emotion with such power that your eyes are wide open with amazement every minute he's on screen.  Even young actor (I assume he's now in his late teens) Sean Nelson is perfectly cast, blowing me away with a performance I'm sure very few young actors can pull off just as effectively.  He only has about 20 or 30 minutes of screen time, yet he's the character you most feel sorry for at times, despite the fact that he lives an unclean life, dealing with thugs and earning his money via dishonest methods.  You can just sense that he didn't have any parental leadership, and he wasn't sure what path in life to take, so he took the most easy one--and also the most dangerous one.  In a way, the two guys are like his surrogate parents.  I've never seen the play, but when I see the name David Mamet under the writing credits, I immediately know that I'm gonna hear some priceless dialogue.  I don't know how he does it, but he just has a relentlessly quick wit when it comes to creating dialogue.  Like a play, this movie is composed of 80 % dialogue, but the dialogue is so great that I don't really care if there's no exciting visuals.  And last but no least, I loved the opening and closing theme song.  It just has that grungy quality that perfectly fits the tone of American Buffalo.

I understand that this film has received quite a number of bashings (not like Pearl Harbor, but even those criticisms weren't that necessary) and an equal amount of praise as well. This is definitely a thinking persons kind of film, though not on the level of something say The Usual Suspects but is close to being there with an ending where all the missing pieces fall right in. I've never seen the original Spanish film that Vanilla Sky was based on, so I'm not even going to waste my time making comparisons. I will say that judging from the reviews and the films story, that Cameron Crowe was not trying to outdo that film, but was trying make something close to it that all audiences, not just American could understand. Secondly, there is nothing wrong with the characters in the story. David Aames (Tom Cruise) is not a yuppie jerk, Sophia (Penelope Cruz) is acting no matter what people say, and Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) is not a total nut job because it takes a lot to tell someone that you love them THAT much. For me, the characters make Vanilla Sky what it is, which is an alternative piece of film, which is what I wanted it to be. The two main female characters in this film, to me, are both direct opposites of each other. They both love David Aames, but in different ways. Sophia loves David only after he has the reconstructive surgery that restores his former beauty. Julie loves him because of who he is on the inside, not because of what his face looks like although ironically she made him like that. There is nothing wrong with the story either. If there are any faults in the story, it's that the science fiction elements in the story aren't that well thought out and that's it. Also, many people are overlooking the fact that as one previous viewer already mentioned, the story is just a series of nightmares and the ending proves this David was just dreaming. So before you go making snap judgments, sit down and actually watch this movie. Who knows, you may just understand it. I know I do.

In a nutshell, three beings called Precogs (short for Precognitive) are able to foresee all killings, usually a day (or less) before they occur. They can identify the killer and the victim, as well as the time of the murder (to the second); it's up to the Precrime team to figure out exactly where the murder will occur based on the Precog visions.It's a system that's never wrong. The Precogs only see crimes that WOULD have happened, not murders that might have happened. In other words, premeditative killings. (Why can't the Precogs see other crimes, such as rapes? Because of, as Anderton put it, the nature of murder; that is, murder is an act unlike any other crime.)As a result of Precrime's efforts, murder in Washington, DC has diminished rapidly - down by 90%. People don't even think about committing murders anymore; the system is that much of a deterrant.Which makes it ripe for a setup, doesn't it?Enter Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell). He's with the Justice Department, on orders from the Attorney General, and he wants to examine Precrime a little more closely. He knows no mistakes are made, but he wants to know why. He's reluctantly given a tour of the facilities by Anderton, and he's even allowed to see the three Precogs.Shortly thereafter, the red ball that indicates the name of the guilty rolls a familiar name - Anderton himself. The next ball, showing the victim, reveals a name unknown to Anderton himself. He doesn't recognize the name, but he's supposed to kill the man in less than three days.  Needless to say, he runs; needless to say, his Precrim teammates follow.This much you would have gathered from the endless promos for the film. It looks, on the surface, like a standard Tom Cruise they're-out-to-get-me movie. In fact, when I saw previews of this movie, that's exactly what I thought. The man's been set up like a bowling pin in movie after movie.But hold on! It's a lot more complicated than that. Anderton's task is not only to find out the connection between him and the victim but also to find out who would want him to kill the man - and why. It's a trip that takes him through some of his own darkest memories (his son was kidnapped, never to be seen again, as a young boy at a public pool).Anderton is not your typical hero figure, either. He's hooked on the new drug of choice, which is consumed in the same way an asthmatic would breathe on an inhaler. He tortures himself nightly by viewing old discs (home movies) of his son and his wife, who left him after the boy's disappearance.Luckily, though, it's not a movie that leans heavily on making things up as it goes along, much like Cruise's last opus, Vanilla Sky. It's full of twists, torturous but not murky. Characters from John's past figure prominently into the plotline, but it's up to him to decide how much importance any one person has in resolving his inner and outer conflicts.The movie is also filled with wonderful special effects, the kind that enhance a film, rather than simply detract from its essence. It doesn't depend on these effects to pull it out of illogical missteps, either. Director Steven Spielberg, with this movie, rebounds nicely from the travesty of A.I. to produce what that alternate-reality movie failed miserably to provide a real, believable plot powered by appealing, plausible characters. The story, based on a Philip K. Dick short story, keeps Anderton on his toes, and the audience along with him. The difference between this movie and many other pretenders is that Minority Report makes the audience care what happens to Anderton at each step of the movie. With many other films, the viewer sort of gives up on the character, either because they can't relate to him or her or because the pacing of the movie is so turgid as to prevent anything but ennui.And Cruise is perfect in the role. Absolutely perfect. When I saw the preview for this film, I thought the movie was trying to turn Tom into another Arnold-like sci-fi hero (Schwarzenegger's Total Recall was also based on a Dick story). I doubted seriously Cruise's ability to get down and dirty with a role, and pull it off. You may recall he was disfigured in Vanilla Sky; here he goes along a similar route, but his motivations and nuances are perfectly captured. The atmosphere created by the elite cinematography and the dazzling characterization from Cruise himself were the highlights of the movie.

","genre":"Action, Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"24 June 2002","score":"","review":"  John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the chief of Precrime, a futuristic law-enforcement program that allows authorities to stop murders - before they occur. In a nutshell, three beings called Precogs (short for Precognitive) are able to foresee all killings, usually a day (or less) before they occur. They can identify the killer and the victim, as well as the time of the murder (to the second); it's up to the Precrime team to figure out exactly where the murder will occur based on the Precog visions.It's a system that's never wrong. The Precogs only see crimes that WOULD have happened, not murders that might have happened. In other words, premeditative killings. (Why can't the Precogs see other crimes, such as rapes? Because of, as Anderton put it, the nature of murder; that is, murder is an act unlike any other crime.)As a result of Precrime's efforts, murder in Washington, DC has diminished rapidly - down by 90%. People don't even think about committing murders anymore; the system is that much of a deterrant.Which makes it ripe for a setup, doesn't it?Enter Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell). He's with the Justice Department, on orders from the Attorney General, and he wants to examine Precrime a little more closely. He knows no mistakes are made, but he wants to know why. He's reluctantly given a tour of the facilities by Anderton, and he's even allowed to see the three Precogs.Shortly thereafter, the red ball that indicates the name of the guilty rolls a familiar name - Anderton himself. The next ball, showing the victim, reveals a name unknown to Anderton himself. He doesn't recognize the name, but he's supposed to kill the man in less than three days.  Needless to say, he runs; needless to say, his Precrim teammates follow.This much you would have gathered from the endless promos for the film. It looks, on the surface, like a standard Tom Cruise they're-out-to-get-me movie. In fact, when I saw previews of this movie, that's exactly what I thought. The man's been set up like a bowling pin in movie after movie.But hold on! It's a lot more complicated than that. Anderton's task is not only to find out the connection between him and the victim but also to find out who would want him to kill the man - and why. It's a trip that takes him through some of his own darkest memories (his son was kidnapped, never to be seen again, as a young boy at a public pool).Anderton is not your typical hero figure, either. He's hooked on the new drug of choice, which is consumed in the same way an asthmatic would breathe on an inhaler. He tortures himself nightly by viewing old discs (home movies) of his son and his wife, who left him after the boy's disappearance.Luckily, though, it's not a movie that leans heavily on making things up as it goes along, much like Cruise's last opus, Vanilla Sky. It's full of twists, torturous but not murky. Characters from John's past figure prominently into the plotline, but it's up to him to decide how much importance any one person has in resolving his inner and outer conflicts.The movie is also filled with wonderful special effects, the kind that enhance a film, rather than simply detract from its essence. It doesn't depend on these effects to pull it out of illogical missteps, either. Director Steven Spielberg, with this movie, rebounds nicely from the travesty of A.I. to produce what that alternate-reality movie failed miserably to provide a real, believable plot powered by appealing, plausible characters. The story, based on a Philip K. Dick short story, keeps Anderton on his toes, and the audience along with him. The difference between this movie and many other pretenders is that Minority Report makes the audience care what happens to Anderton at each step of the movie. With many other films, the viewer sort of gives up on the character, either because they can't relate to him or her or because the pacing of the movie is so turgid as to prevent anything but ennui.And Cruise is perfect in the role. Absolutely perfect. When I saw the preview for this film, I thought the movie was trying to turn Tom into another Arnold-like sci-fi hero (Schwarzenegger's Total Recall was also based on a Dick story). I doubted seriously Cruise's ability to get down and dirty with a role, and pull it off. You may recall he was disfigured in Vanilla Sky; here he goes along a similar route, but his motivations and nuances are perfectly captured. The atmosphere created by the elite cinematography and the dazzling characterization from Cruise himself were the highlights of the movie.

If it werent for Britney Spears, the obsessive teens that saw this movie wouldn't have seen it, the media wouldn't have noticed it; come to think of it, nobody would have been foolish enough to direct such a poor movie off of such an absurd script.Predictability is the thing that stands out in my mind.  As I watched this movie on a plane ride from Hawai'i to LAX, I think I could have written the story out from the very beginning of the movie.  Every scene is so obvious and contrived from the previous ones that I feel like i'm watching a movie that was written by a High School Freshman Dance class.  Not only is the whole linear and boring plot predictable, but individual scenes are just as predictable.  This movie throws no surprises, curves, or has anything of interest.  From begining to end, this movie sloths forward to what would seem like a climax, but after an hour (two thirds of the movie) into the movie, its realized that there won't be a climax.  Three immature and childish (although all looking 20+) highschool girls go off on a roadtrip with some guy, and by the end of the movie the writers and directors must have realized that nothing was coming of the movie.  As such, they simply took all three character's shallow and contrived stories and wound them all together in a total writing-cop out.  The movie could have ended after the first scene, the second, or any other scene there after right up until the end and I don't think I would have noticed.The dialogue is miserable and the environments boring and have already all been done.  Britney's character, lucy, and her boyfriend\/nerdy lab partner (whos name is forgotten after the second or third) decide to Do it after prom.  This never happens, because Lucy has doubts.  Are you sure you want to do it? she nervously asks, clad in bra and panty. The guy then proceeds to actually pull out a LIST of reasons WHY they should.  What planet are these people from?  The best part is that Lucy, after hearing the list, composed of such winners as Because we're lab partners, and I can't go to college a virgin, is actually temporarily convinced!  But, alas, Lucy is a smart girl and decides to wait for love. How thoughtful.  What depth.Britney, the typical amazingly-beautiful-yet-brilliant-nerd-gets-pushed-around-in-highschool, walks around highschool with her head hung low with her nerdy boyfriend\/labpartner and plays pretty-made-fun-of-nerd-virgin-in-pink.  Speaking of Ms. Spears, I once heard someone say that this was a foray into new territory for Britney or a step in a new direction.  Folks, watch this movie and look at britney's character.  Britney's character, Lucy, is a nerd for the first part of the movie but all too soon, lucy turns into Britney Spears. She's an amazing singer, seductive dancer, cute little school girl charm and sexy blonde.  Britney Spears plays the same person she is in real life!  A move in another direction?  This whole movie is about her - its like a little biography or tribute, or even a music video with a few extra added in blocks of unused time.  Her acting is just like her music videos; dancing around like a blond fool with a great body.  To her credit, I've seen much worse acting.  She wasn't all that bad.  But, it wasn't hard.  SHE WAS PLAYING HERSELF.  Everyone else was just filler. As a matter of fact, any character at any given time could be replaced with any random person, or wholly taken out for that matter, and it would have little or no effect on the story.While watching this movie, we dont' care at all about the characters or what happens to them, but rather when Britney is going to get cherry picked.  It sounds lewd, but its true.  A few minutes into the movie, we already see Britney in JUST her bra and underwear, and shortly thereafter she almost has sex with some idiot.  The rest of the movie does a miserable job of portraying her budding romance with this guy she takes this absurd trip with, and of course at the end, they decide to do it.   Are you sure you're ready? he so kindly asks.  Yes, I want to do it.  Cry.  Tear. How great.This tribute to Britney's sex appeal and singing talent (which I very much hesitate to call it talent) is nothing more than throwing a pretty face into a shallow and aimless plot with a few other pretty faces.  Had I been given a full frontal lobotomy or had my ears surgically removed, I might have been able to sit through this movie without thinking I was being tortured or as Mystery Science theater 3000.Now, directors and writers out there, lets not make this mistake again.  If theres one thing this movie can do (besides bolster Britney record sales and worldwide appeal), its show future directors and writers what not do.  Lets not let this happen again.Meanwhile, I hope I'll see this on MST3k, or maybe on TV in a room full of drunk people.  Lets see Britney in a movie where she doesn't play an innocent yet sexy and attractive singer\/dancer trying to find her self, and maybe then we can gauge her (lack of?) acting skills.

After all Fincher did `Fight Club', which is in my personal top three movies of all time, as well as `Se7en' which is in my top ten. He's got a lot to live up to and yet this concept, a sort of adult `Home Alone' had me wary. could he pull it off? Almost, but he was let down by a poor script by David `Spiderman' Koepp.The plot's nice and simple. Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) has moved into a huge New York home with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart), using money gained from her divorce. One of the house's features is a panic room - a room cut off from the outside world which you can lock yourself into in times of trouble. Guess what? Trouble arrives in the form of three burglars intent on stealing something. The problem? What they want is in the panic room, and the Altman's, terrified, have now locked themselves in.The script is where things get let down. It's obvious. You can generally predicate what's going to happen and are left unsurprised then when it does. The burglars feel very much like stock characters - there's the I-am-not-so-bad-just-down-on-my-luck type (Forrest Whittaker), the crazy-wild-guy (a disappointing Jared Leto), and the cold-psychotic-guy (Dwight Yoakam). They thus feel one dimensional, not helped by Leto's manic, over-the-top performance that almost renders them comically inept. This isn't good for a thriller. Fortunately Jodie Foster puts in a fine performance as the strong, concerned mother who genuinely emotes fear, love, and hate on screen and Kristen Stewart is a welcome new addition for teenage actors by virtue of not being loathsome as most are.It's up to David Fincher to save the movie, and he mostly succeeds. He's the current maestro of atmosphere and visuals in Hollywood, using innovative techniques to help otherwise staid scripts rise over their limitations. Here he doesn't get quite as creative as he does with `Fight Club', both because it's a more mainstream picture and because the movie doesn't require it. Nevertheless his camera work is superb. It roams from room to room, and yet also is able to enter keyholes, or examine minute particles of dust in incredibly fluid transitions. Naturally, with Fincher at the helm, there's a great use of lighting and shadows - one of his goals was to achieve a `realism' in this movie, in that the viewer would be no more privy to what a character could see than that character. This works excellently, allowing him to crank up the tension by suffocating the viewer in the same closed universe as the protagonists. The use of a relatively small set, notches up the claustrophobic angle, accentuated by the aforementioned lighting. The music scheme to the movie is typically subdued, never overwhelming but creating a linger sense of fore boding in the viewer's head - Howard Shore's work is again appreciated by me for not having the full on effect of a James Horner piece.Despite Fincher and Foster's work here, I can't help but feel disappointed by `The Panic Room' because of the oft-flimsy screenplay that failed to fully realise the movie's potential. The visuals and acting were good enough to distract me and let me gawp at their prettiness, but afterwards I was left a bit cold feeling Fincher's creative talents could be better spent on material that allowed him to expend all his energies. It's his work alone here that makes me add a few marks on to the movie to give it a 7.8\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 June 2002","score":"","review":"  I had high hopes for this movie.

The story revolves around a mysteriouswatch with the power to speed the wearer's molecules and allow him to move faster than anything around him does. Scientist Earl Dopler sent a prototype of the device to friend and college professor George Gibbs to help him perfect the device. One afternoon, the watch accidentally falls into a broken toaster where George's son Zak picks up to take with him.Zak has been trying to get a new foreign exchange student to go out with him. She finally agrees after he goes out of his way to stop some bullies from harassing her and agrees to have him come over to her house to help rake the lawn.When he activates the watch, thinking it's a stopwatch, time slows suddenly and while taking the bag of leaves to the garbage can comes across a hissing possum. He pokes it and thinks it's dead and waltzes into Francesca's house to show her what he found that was invading the trash cans and his watch suddenly ends its time and everything goes back into standard motion. The possum isn't really dead and when he tries to explain, things get out of hand.After figuring out what the watch does, Zak and friends go on the lam trying to escape the organization that's trying to get it back. They use similar watches, preventing him from using the watch as an escape mechanism.Nickelodeon films, one of the production companies behind the film, have been known for good and bad movies throughout their feature film career and have managed to stumble across both an idea and a director that works. Frakes proved his capabilities with the feature film Star Trek First Contact, a terrific film that shines among its fellow Star Trek films. Now, Frakes has branched further into the science fiction genre, stepping away from his small screen productions. He takes a potential childish and unemotional film, blends in the right amount of scientific explanation, avoids paradoxes adroitly and keeps the film excellently paced with plenty of room for enjoyment.The performances are probably the weakest part of the film.

Cain novel (`The Postman Always Rings Twice') on which this movie was based, so I cannot compare this film version to it, but I have seen and love the 1946 US version (also entitled `Postman').Even better is this gem from Italy, which, I have read, was `mutilated' in editing because of too many blatant references to the Fascist regime.  Well, no matter &#150; what is left is a fine piece of cinema, apparently the forerunner of the neo-realist movement in film-making.  One can certainly see why &#150; despite whatever harsh editing did go on, a pervading sense of societal and cultural, as well as personal oppression remains, hanging heavy over the protagonists, who therefore face many limits in life.Consider Gino, the young drifter, not well educated, unemployed, and resorting to stowing away, stealing and conning people in order to get by, his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless.In Giovanna, he sees a way out, yet he should have kept going, as Giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money, her job (working at the trattoria for her husband, slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen), and her sex.  In the past, she had limited options, and decided to marry the restaurant\/gas station owner (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa) anyway, knowing that he would not make her happy.  She tells Gino that she feels sick every time Bregana touches her.On the pretext of helping Bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part (which he has in fact pocketed), Gino wins Bregana's favor (promising also to fix the broken water pump &#150; water symbolizing life, or lack thereof) and is left alone with Giovanna.  They immediately start a heated, passionate, yet volatile love affair.Gino soon feels stifled by the relationship, and feels the need to move on again when Giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband.  Wanting no part of it, Gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford, kindly paid for him by another gypsy-type man named Spagnolo, a fellow train passenger.  To Gino, Spagnolo represents a sort of freedom, and they become friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes Gino's morality and conscience), traveling and finding work at a carnival together. Finally Gino has steady employment.  To his dismay (he is not yet over his love for Giovanna), a month has passed when Bregana and his wife go to the carnival and Bregana persuades Gino to go `back home' to live and work with them again, as he is handy to have around.Too weak-willed to resist, knowing this will reunite he and Giovanna, Gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple.  After a while he gives in to Gina's demands to get rid of her husband.   Once the evil deed is done, Giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than ever, seeming to have very little conscience, while guilt and shame eat away at Gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm.  As much as he wants to leave her &#150; he does again briefly, they are now inextricably linked, and must face the consequences.I liked the way the Spagnolo character came back into Gino's life to act as a judge of his misdeeds &#150; that was very good, and interesting, adding another dimension to the story.While the '46 U.S. version with Lana Turner and John Garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters, especially the cops and the lawyers, Ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone.  This gives the final outcome even more potency, and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live.A minor quibble  The amount of time (hardly any) that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers, how quickly they kill the husband (there is no botched first attempt as in the U.S. version); Gino's very quick-to-escalate relationship with the dancer\/hooker &#150; they quickly profess their love as well, and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met! &#150; all rather unrealistic, isn't it?  I found this time-frame problem quite distracting &#150; it made me think that I must have missed something somewhere.  Otherwise, well worth the viewer's time.  The acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout.  Recommended.

Cain novel (`The Postman Always Rings Twice') on which this movie was based, so I cannot compare this film version to it, but I have seen and love the 1946 US version (also entitled `Postman').Even better is this gem from Italy, which, I have read, was `mutilated' in editing because of too many blatant references to the Fascist regime.  Well, no matter &#150; what is left is a fine piece of cinema, apparently the forerunner of the neo-realist movement in film-making.  One can certainly see why &#150; despite whatever harsh editing did go on, a pervading sense of societal and cultural, as well as personal oppression remains, hanging heavy over the protagonists, who therefore face many limits in life.Consider Gino, the young drifter, not well educated, unemployed, and resorting to stowing away, stealing and conning people in order to get by, his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless.In Giovanna, he sees a way out, yet he should have kept going, as Giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money, her job (working at the trattoria for her husband, slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen), and her sex.  In the past, she had limited options, and decided to marry the restaurant\/gas station owner (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa) anyway, knowing that he would not make her happy.  She tells Gino that she feels sick every time Bregana touches her.On the pretext of helping Bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part (which he has in fact pocketed), Gino wins Bregana's favor (promising also to fix the broken water pump &#150; water symbolizing life, or lack thereof) and is left alone with Giovanna.  They immediately start a heated, passionate, yet volatile love affair.Gino soon feels stifled by the relationship, and feels the need to move on again when Giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband.  Wanting no part of it, Gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford, kindly paid for him by another gypsy-type man named Spagnolo, a fellow train passenger.  To Gino, Spagnolo represents a sort of freedom, and they become friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes Gino's morality and conscience), traveling and finding work at a carnival together. Finally Gino has steady employment.  To his dismay (he is not yet over his love for Giovanna), a month has passed when Bregana and his wife go to the carnival and Bregana persuades Gino to go `back home' to live and work with them again, as he is handy to have around.Too weak-willed to resist, knowing this will reunite he and Giovanna, Gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple.  After a while he gives in to Gina's demands to get rid of her husband.   Once the evil deed is done, Giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than ever, seeming to have very little conscience, while guilt and shame eat away at Gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm.  As much as he wants to leave her &#150; he does again briefly, they are now inextricably linked, and must face the consequences.I liked the way the Spagnolo character came back into Gino's life to act as a judge of his misdeeds &#150; that was very good, and interesting, adding another dimension to the story.While the '46 U.S. version with Lana Turner and John Garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters, especially the cops and the lawyers, Ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone.

It is a wonderful feel-good light drama about the good and bad of what Hollywood gives to America, and the games the power people play freely with the lives of others (on this note, the two studio conferences actually voiced by accomplished directors, are utterly hysterical gems). The Majestic is also a marvelous depiction of the great American small town, and a realization of just how much we have give up in the name of progress -- the cast, led by vets Whitmore, Landau, Stiers, and DeMunn are just wonderful in this regard.  As a romance, it gets an incomplete.  Laurie Holden is never particularly convincing in her character despite great support from Papa Stiers, so the director wisely lets the true romance be between Carrey and the town, with Holden reduced to suitable window dressing.  The nice try is the attempted lesson to be learned when America turns into a bully.  I must assume that the film was already filmed when the War Against Terrorism broke out, but the lesson of not allowing our fears to turn America into a police state has never been more appropriate.  But Balaban plays the Roy Cohn surrogate so broadly and ineptly that the menace never seems to have enough teeth.  Also, from a pacing standpoint, I think we spent too much time watching Carrey feel out the town before he mistakenly accepted his new identity enough to put his heart and soul into rebuilding the Majestic -- a nostalgic valentine well-deserving to be the American equivalent of Cinema Paradiso. This movie is not for the hard-edged, hyper-critical, and misanthropic -- they are welcome to watch Requiem For A Dream or Traffic again if they wish.

Amélie's little schemes are NOT the work of an angel they're not motivated by altruism, most cause at roughly as much misery as they do happiness, one comes to a bad end and another of them was just plain nasty.  That's the POINT.  The film's mostly happy ending is meant to come across like the happy ending to Emma - good fortune rather than good management, and more than the heroine deserved.About the McDonalds criticism Yes, no doubt the real Montmarte has McDonalds outlets in it.  That's no reason at all to put such things in the movie.  They don't make Montmarte any better and they wouldn't make the movie any better.  This is an important point.  When we find ourselves tolerating the presence of McDonalds outlets even in our fantasies, the battle against them will have been lost what we have trained ourselves to tolerate in fantasy we cannot help but tolerate in real life.

During the press junkets for this film, so many fluff entertainment reporters would question Mel, so what DO women want? The actor would laugh, the reporter would smile, and Entertainment Tonight would lead off with a cute story. It is obvious that the marketing department for the studio thought they knew what women wanted and gave it to them. Just look at the poster and video box- 'WHAT WOMEN WANT,' and a picture of an adorable Mel grinning from ear to ear. This film plays it so safe, I thought a minor trims could have turned this into a G-rated film.Mel Gibson plays perhaps the nicest, sweetest, most likeable womanizer in film history. I was ready to see Mel treat women like cr@p, and get his comeuppance when he began to know what they were really thinking, but I was wrong. He stretches credibility by trying on women's products on the orders of his new boss Helen Hunt, and electrocutes himself in a bathtub with a hair dryer. Suddenly, he can hear what women are thinking. He uses this to begin to take down Hunt, who got the job he wanted, and beds the pathetic Tomei, knowing her every sexual wish. He also begins to read the mind of his daughter, Ashley Johnson, who is blossoming into womanhood (and he cannot do anything about it), and the mind of a suicidal mousy worker at his ad agency. You would think this kind of can't-miss set up would really score some points for relevance. I was wrong. Helen Hunt plays the exact same role she played on Mad About You. I kept expecting everyone to call her Jamie before she went home to Paul Reiser. She comes to the agency with b!tch on wheels rumors swirling about her, but she turns out to be nice. So nice. Too nice. Couldn't we see some kind of emotion from this character besides sheepish smiles?Mel beds down Marisa Tomei's character in one embarassing scene. He has been asking her out for months, gets her into bed, decides he loves Hunt, so he gets rid of Tomei by telling her HE IS GAY. Where was the outcry from the homosexual community over this little bit of stupidity? Here is Mel, using an easy out (so to speak) to dump a character the writers should have trimmed in the first place. And why would a gay man spend months asking a woman out, sleep with her, and then admit he's gay? Does anyone else see the logic behind this, much less the fact that Tomei buys it and promptly removes herself from the film? I kept hoping she would pop up later and tell Hunt this little gay fact, but nope.Ashley Johnson is wonderful as Mel's daughter who has obviously picked the wrong guy she plans to lose her virginity to on prom night. Thank God some casting director did not go cast Denise Richards or Jessica Biel in a role that required a substantial amount of teen awkwardness, and Johnson is great here. Bette Midler also has a completely unnecessary role here, in a cameo as a psychiatrist. Her role also seemed to be cast, and then written. If you are a known womanizer who can suddenly read the thoughts of the very women you pursue, do you really need Midler to tell you that you can use this power to get more women into bed? That would be my first thought! Midler also disappears, and I also kept waiting for her to pop up later. Never did.Finally, the mousy suicidal clerk. Mel reads her mind. She is unhappy at work, no one would notice if she just died. Mel gets this constant vibe, is nice to her a couple of times, realizes he is partly to blame for her depression, and goes to see her when she does not show up for work one day- something she has been promising to do through the whole movie. Mel goes to her back alley apartment, gets showered in sparks, and loses his ability to read thoughts. He goes up to mousy girl's place anyway, breaks in, and finds an empty pill bottle and a suicide note! Oh, no, Mel's too late! The film does have an edge!...no, mousy girl pops out of the bathroom, Mel offers her a copywrighting job, and he leaves to win back Hunt, who was fired by sensitive Alan Alda, and the job given to Mel. I thought, well, what about the empty pill bottle? After Mel left did she dial 911, tell them about her fabulous new job that cured her suicidal depression, and request a stomach pump?The finale, involving Mel and Helen reciting what seems to be rejected Hallmark cards to each other is a letdown. When Mel is alone onscreen, he does that irritating habit where he has complete conversations with himself, like the dolt he played in Conspiracy Theory. I wanted him to just shut up so often. Well, one of my longest reviews concludes, but there was a lot wrong with this film. This really is not a film, it is the result of test audience samplings and opinion polls. This is easy film making by committee, guaranteed to make money and not harm anyone's career, although if you have an inkling what Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine's purposes were here, you are smarter than I.

","genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"24 June 2002","score":"","review":"  The year is 1982, and Disney, still in the grip of its what would Walt have done? era under then-Chairman and Executive Producer Ron Miller, has, in a rare fit of innovation, hired Boston-based animator\/director Steven Lisberger to create a spectacular sci-fi revolution. It will eventually be titled TRON.At its core, the basic plot of TRON is a standard right-the-wrong story. Kevin Flynn, the film's central character (Jeff Bridges), is an up-and-coming videogame-arcade owner, recently fired from his job at a top electronics conglomerate named Encom. Flynn, however, has reason to believe that his firing was unjust; and the story follows his bid to correct that error. As we hear him tell his former co-workers, Dr. Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) and his girlfriend\/colleague, Laura (Cindy Morgan), Flynn had been part of Encom 3 years earlier, and had hoped to launch his own game-making enterprise on the strength of the game Space Paranoids, which he himself had designed. Fate, however, intervened --- and his name turned out to be Ed Dillinger (David Warner). It is Dillinger, Flynn explains, who was responsible for stealing the original Paranoid program; the problem is, Encom's all-powerful --- and power-hungry --- Master Control Program (MCP) has shut down access to the entire system, preventing Flynn from obtaining the evidence he needs to prove Dillinger's treachery.To secure that evidence, Flynn must journey into the heart of the MCP itself.... and what a journey that is! We are taken into an electronic society whose inhabitants --- exact doppelganers of the humans who programmed them --- wage intense video-battles for the right to survive and flourish. This, I think, would say something about the career of Steven Lisberger himself. Many of those responsible for TRON came from Lisberger's Boston-based animation studio --- among them, producer Donald Kushner and supervising animator Roger Allers. They had just come off of filming the 1980 feature Animalympics, and were all set to sell the rights to that film's characters to NBC, the idea being to use said characters as Saturday-morning hosts for the duration of the Summer Olympic Games. Alas, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and President Jimmy Carter's boycott of the Moscow games put the kibosh on those plans (even now, Lisberger's Animalympic characters are gaining a rebirth of sorts on the web); so now, two years later, they hoped to have better luck with the Mouse Factory.While the visuals of TRON were fairly exciting, the film was a limited sort of success when it was originally released; indeed, it did little to boost director Lisberger's subsequent career. He claims to be in negotiations with Disney to conceive, direct and supervise an alleged sequel, to be called TRON 2.0 --- but, as always, I'll believe it when I see it. Still, there can be no denial that TRON was the first movie to really fuse together the worlds of motion pictures and computer technology. I watched an excerpt from a retrospective making-of documentary on TRON in which it was revealed that the Academy refused to even nominate the film for a Visual Effects Oscar because neither models on hand-drawn animation was used in creating TRON's visuals. This got me to thinking Were we all that nearsighted, even in a post-Star Wars generation? Perhaps we did not know it at the time, but I would imagine that some of us believed we had reached the future of special-effects based movies. Wrong. It would be up to Pixar and Toy Story some 15 years later to raise the bar in terms of the future of the marriage of computer and film. John Lasseter hit the nail on the head Without TRON, he said, there would be no 'Toy Story'. And even today, there are some who have no choice but to agree. I happen to be one of those people.In fact, I for one would not only like to see a renaissance of TRON, but also a renaissance of the original legacy of director Steven Lisberger, in the form of his characters from Animalympics. If Disney secures the rights to that property, and hires him to supervise and direct a new version, that likewise would be the coolest thing of all! Hopefully, those who are now re-embracing TRON will let the Mouse Factory know.In closing, though, just this there will always be controversies in films and filmmaking --- spearheaded by men and women who are more than willing to think outside the normal way of filmmaking. Such a person, I think, is Steven Lisberger ..... and his epic saga called TRON was, and is, among the first pioneer films to represent this small breed of controversies.

Fate, however, intervened --- and his name turned out to be Ed Dillinger (David Warner). It is Dillinger, Flynn explains, who was responsible for stealing the original Paranoid program; the problem is, Encom's all-powerful --- and power-hungry --- Master Control Program (MCP) has shut down access to the entire system, preventing Flynn from obtaining the evidence he needs to prove Dillinger's treachery.To secure that evidence, Flynn must journey into the heart of the MCP itself.... and what a journey that is!

The key plot concept is beautifully simple - machines take over the earth in the future. Machines are eventually over thrown by one man. Machines travel back in time to kill man's mother, thus preventing him being born and stopping their own defeat.  One human also travels back to stop the machines from killing his leader's mother.`The Terminator' is a classic good versus evil struggle, with little in the way of greys clouding the issue. The terminator is an unstoppable brutal remorseless killer, and it perfectly suits Arnold Schwarzenegger's limited acting abilities. His few lines, including the infamous `I'll be back' are all well judged and timed, and give a great feeling of precision and inhumanity to his character. Coupled with his chiselled features, he's the best choice for the role. Michael Biehn is playing a character type that he'd reprise two years later in Cameron's `Aliens' - the human tough guy he's got the fight, but still the ability to love and care for people. His features are well chosen for this and although his delivery of lines is hardly exceptional - they tend to come out in the same tone of voice - he's able to carry his part. Linda Hamilton is the woman-thrown-into-chaos, somewhat reminiscent of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character in `Alien', although Hamilton doesn't have Weaver's strength of presence. All the actors are, for an action science fiction, above average and so never distract.It's the script, with Cameron's force behind it that lifts the movie from mediocrity. Yes, there's a certain amount of corniness - the `we loved a life time' element for example - but the movie has a real sense of conviction present. The movie believes in itself and, through its passion, will make you believe too. There's a general sense of darkness in the movie - rarely do we see daylight, and, when we do, it's often the soft light of dawn. There's a nice sense of tension in the action scenes, helped not only by Cameron's camera work but also by an excellent electronic score (including a fantastic brooding credit sequence). Sure some of the SFX look clunky in these days of `Attack of the Clones' and `The Fellowship of the Ring', but they still work. There's a certain sense of inevitability, intertwined with hope, permeating the picture that creates a mood I particularly enjoyed and that's harder to find in the current crop of science fiction movies.`The Terminator' is not a perfect picture. The movie lags in some parts, and the romance element is fairly contrived. Despite all that the movie brims with energy and promise, a script that mostly delivers, characters you can enjoy, and the ultimate Arnie role. Well worth catching. 8\/10.
