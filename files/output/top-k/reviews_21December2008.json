The look of the movie is gorgeous. Every detail seems to have been addressed. The forest looks alive and full of wonder whereas Darkness's abode looks dark and dangerous (yet mesmerizing). The movie also deals with several themes such as temptation and love. It also has the usual theme of good verses evil but it is handled with expert care. The acting is very good too. Tim Curry is fantastic as Darkness. He delivers his lines perfectly. It is a wonderful performance that makes that character stand the test of time. Now Tom Cruise as Jack and Mia Sarah as Lily are a little more straightforward but they fit in the overall context of the story.Now the two different versions are different. The U.S. version is superior in my opinion. The tangerine dream score fits the movie better. It gives it a dream like quality, almost haunting. Whereas the longer director's cut has a Jerry Goldsmith score which in my opinion is not as good (especially when you hear the tangerine dream's score). The U.S. version is also shorter (about 90 min.) but it seems to work. The director's cut runs almost 2 hours and there are places where it drags and has singing and an ending that is not really satisfying when you consider all the characters have been through. There are a few scenes from the director's cut that should have stayed in the U.S. version (especially the scene with the swamp witch Meg) but it does not detour you from the overall viewing experience.My score is for the U.S. version alone. It is a fantastic movie. Yes there are a few flaws and character development is not as strong with some characters but all in all it is a great movie. I would love to see a sequel or a reboot of this. A PG-13 rating would not hurt either. I am surprised no one has even thought of doing it (especially with the success of Lord of The Rings). There is a audience for good fantasy films if done right. This movie is a good place to start especially since it has a heart to its story that a lot of films seem to lack.

However as far as '40's screwball comedies are concerned; this really isn't the best movie that the genre has to offer. Sure, it's all good and fun but it's just lacking this bit of cleverness and true hilarity.Blame the script for this. Mostly these type of movies are brilliantly constructed story-wise and its main characters stumble from the one odd and hilarious situation into the other. Same is also the case with this movie but it just isn't quite all as hilarious and well flowing as you would expect.Some sequences are too long and too often the movies stays too much at the same place. This is the foremost reason why it feels as if this movie isn't always flowing that well. As an indirect result of this, some characters feel like they are being used, while others feel like they are being overused. The story often feels like it could had made its point earlier and reached what it tried to achieve much earlier. Because of this it takes awhile for the story to really get off the ground.Sure, it's still a fun and entertaining movie to watch though. It's nothing too hilarious but good enough nevertheless for more than a couple of laughs. The fans of the genre will therefore also not be disappointed with this movie. Guess I'm just not Preston Sturges' biggest fan when it comes down to his screwball comedies. I also thought his other acclaimed screwball comedy Sullivan's Travels, which he made one year prior to this movie, is a tad bit overrated.Both movies also star Joel McCrea, who wasn't the biggest actor within the game but he nevertheless is a great leading man, with also the right psychics. Not really sure why he never really truly broke through like an actor. He's mostly known for his work in some early westerns.It's all good and fun but there are some better genre movies to watch out there in my opinion.7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"21 December 2008","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" This type of movies were very popular in the late '30's and early '40's.

Same is also the case with this movie but it just isn't quite all as hilarious and well flowing as you would expect.Some sequences are too long and too often the movies stays too much at the same place. This is the foremost reason why it feels as if this movie isn't always flowing that well. As an indirect result of this, some characters feel like they are being used, while others feel like they are being overused. The story often feels like it could had made its point earlier and reached what it tried to achieve much earlier. Because of this it takes awhile for the story to really get off the ground.Sure, it's still a fun and entertaining movie to watch though. It's nothing too hilarious but good enough nevertheless for more than a couple of laughs. The fans of the genre will therefore also not be disappointed with this movie. Guess I'm just not Preston Sturges' biggest fan when it comes down to his screwball comedies. I also thought his other acclaimed screwball comedy Sullivan's Travels, which he made one year prior to this movie, is a tad bit overrated.Both movies also star Joel McCrea, who wasn't the biggest actor within the game but he nevertheless is a great leading man, with also the right psychics. Not really sure why he never really truly broke through like an actor. He's mostly known for his work in some early westerns.It's all good and fun but there are some better genre movies to watch out there in my opinion.7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Romance, Comedy"},{"date":"21 December 2008","score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) returns from the American Civil War to the home of his brother Aaron (Walter Coy) in Texas.The year is 1868, three years after the war ended.What he has been doing for the past three years, no one knows.Shortly after his arrival the Comanches come and kill his brother and sister-in-law Martha (Dorothy Jordan), his nephew, Ben (Robert Lyden).His nieces Lucy (Pippa Scott) and Debbie (Lana Wood, later sister Natalie Wood) are missing.Ethan and Aaron's adopted son Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), who has a little Cherokee blood in him find the place all burned down.A group goes after these Indians with a revenge on their mind.The acclaimed director John Ford directed this western masterpiece, The Searchers in 1956.Ford liked to cast John Wayne to play the leading men.He certainly is the right man to play Ethan Edwards.He was underrated as an actor.In this movie he's the hero who has some unheroic qualities.Wayne makes this man likable.The Duke liked the character Ethan so much he even named his youngest son after him.His son Patrick Wayne plays Lt.

As a biography however, which is supposed to tell you the truth about a person, I think it's simply a piece of blatant propaganda. I see it as a lost chance to do the man Malcolm X Little justice, and also to show up the critical aspects of his persona.The acting is great, I particularly enjoyed Angela Bassett as Malcolm X's wife Betty Shabazz, as well as director Spike Lee playing Malcolm's zoot era friend, the wily Shorty. Overall this movie is well made, as can be expected of a great director such as Spike Lee.OK, let's focus on content, then. Malcolm X wasn't Martin Luther King, but this movie portrays him like he had been King's ghetto version. In his autobiography, Malcolm X describes himself as having started as a street thug, although one who was driven to this life by racism, who was transformed in prison to a black minister and leader. An alternative but possibly more enlightened way to describe his career would be that he took up the same profession as his father, that of a black separatist minister (his father had followed Marcus Garvey, Malcolm followed Elijah Muhammad instead).Another fact that the movie didn't bring out is that the Nation Of Islam are no Muslims. They were an idiosyncratic black American sect which borrowed some formal aspects from Islam, and sold Elijah Muhammad instead of adhering to his prophet namesake. One interesting question to ask yourself about Malcolm X is, when did he figure out that the NOI were about as halal as ham hock? If he really only became wise to the game after Muhammad had kicked him out, that would have made him seem a bit dim in the intellectual department (and I don't think that he was anything but sharp). But if he found out before then why didn't he leave the sect by himself? Does anyone really buy his magic transformation into a proper Muslim and non-racist on the hadj he went on after he had been forced to leave NOI? In the movie, Malcolm starts to doubt Elijah Muhammad pretty abruptly when he finds out that he has fathered children with his -- very much younger -- secretaries. This is shown melodramatically where the mothers are dressed up in their full freaky NOI costume, have their darling children playing around their feet and profess that they are only worried about their toddlers' wellbeing, i. e. present the picture of purity. I didn't buy that either, neither in the film nor in Malcolm X's life.There are simply some aspects this movie should have addressed, some questions it should have raised. Instead it cultivates and adulates Malcom X. Apart from being a fierce speaker and writer, what actual plans did Malcolm X have? Did he implement them, did they work out, did they fail? How serious was he about separating the races, or was that just rhetorics? Did he actually further or hinder the Civil Rights movement? Didn't he, especially in the light of Obama, fail quite badly by his own standards? One scene I didn't buy at all was when Malcolm liberates a black man from racist police imprisonment. He threatens the officer in charge by telling him to look out of the window, through which we see a thin row of NOI goons standing before the police precinct. Somehow the captain freaks at the sight of 20 dudes in suits and ties and immediately gives in. In the following scene, Malcolm gives them a sign and they turn around like robots and march off. Wow, that's how the NOI fought? Too bad Martin Luther King hadn't thought of that. Although I'd advise anyone not to don suit and tie and descend on the local police outpost yet. Spike Lee feeds us off with simple cinematic razzle-dazzle.Spike Lee also tells us quite unambiguously that Malcolm's father was murdered by the KKK, where this is at best highly speculative.Another point were the NOI with their guru, their uniforms, their sex separation and their bodyguards not perhaps a pretty scary outfit? Scary not only in the KKK had finally met their match-sense but more as in made the KKK seem like a regular bunch of guys with a hood fixation, and the John Birch Society like a bunch of hippies? Just a thought.Then in the final scene Spike Lee serves up a I'm Malcom X scene which wouldn't have looked out of place in a Stalinist propaganda film.Malcolm X once said that all his achievements should be blamed on Allah, and only his failings on himself. Spike Lee should have taken his word. If you want to learn more about Malcolm X, then even his autobiography is a better choice.

From the moment the film opens you see this terrifying black pot with this deep dark voice over which is then contrasted with the introduction of Taren, the central character and his pig, Hen.It turns out the horned king is searching for the black cauldron which will give him the power to raise an army from the dead and to find the black cauldron the king will come looking for Hen, a pig with strange divining powers so Taren (who dreams of adventure and the like) must take Hen to the cottage on the other side of the wood and keep her hidden there.On the way however Hen is stolen by some terrifying flying dragon monster things and Taren had to follow them to the horned kings castle and get hen back.The Horned King is as frightening as for once he should be and voiced by the immensely talented John Hurt. He is the most affective animated villain ever on screen and i say that with confidence. However to lighten the mood a little he is accompanied by a delightful but much abused little green goblin who is great fun as well as sweet and quite charming even if he is a little mischievous.Also along the way Taren comes across a sweet but strong minded princess, a highly dishonest but charming bard and the most irritating character ever put on screen. I can't remember his name but it's irritating. He is the one thing i am afraid the brings down the entire film in Disney's lame attempt to introduce comedy into the mix.The film closes with a dramatic and thrilling climax and does not disappoint. It was a welcome relief and change from every other Disney movie and a great success as far as i'm concerned. you might not like it but i always will.the Animation is poor and so is the script but the story and the characters shine though and will remain one of my favourite cartoons of all time whatever anyone else says about it.

It's maybe easy in the case of Cabaret, easier than say All That Jazz. But then again, Cabaret was already written and a big hit on Broadway, and Fosse's task was to make it feel real and vibrant in a cinematic setting (unlike All That Jazz, which had the super-ambition of being an original 8 1\/2 type of project). After finally seeing the film, it's perhaps not surprising that he won the Oscar that year; this is the kind of craftsmanship that Hollywood was used to, even if it wasn't quite as iconic as the Godfather, which ultimately got picture anyway. It's a musical that *moves* incredibly when it needs to, but also stays close to the chest(s) of its characters, their little dramas played out against the slowly building scale of the Third Reich.It's a story we all know, sort of American girl finds British boy in late 30s Germany, boy grows attached to girl over some friendly time, boy and girl grow friendly also with German boy hiding fact he's Jewish even from his beloved Jewish girl, American girl may be pregnant with a child that she doesn't know, so on and so forth. Actually, a lot of this is just the stuff of apple-ripe melodrama, full of the little twists and motivations and outbursts and, thankfully in this case, subtleties that make it all so palpable and fresh for audiences. The dialog is also perfectly witty for a movie musical (not quite Singin' in the Rain, but close enough), and ingrained in the setting of a cabaret there's some raunch to be had... within the realm of PG for 1972 of course.But back to the direction for a moment, since there's enough that's already been written about how wonderful Liza Minelli is and how awesomely flamboyant Joel Grey is or how restrained Michael York can be- all terrific in their juicy parts. Two scenes and a shot should be looked at for interest points when Minelli's Sally and York are under the train tracks, we see Sally scream out, and begs York to scream out too in sync with the train going by above. Just as he's about to scream, which would be the typical thing to see (i.e. Garden State), Fosse suddenly cuts to a man being beaten, this inter-cut with a warped musical number with Master of Ceremonies and his gaggle of girls. It's a sharp cut but it's smart and concise and one is not only not confused but it's refreshing. Another scene is when Minelli is in the woods relaxing with York, him miles away in thought and she trying to sound optimistic as an expecting mother - she then flashes to some moments, visions of the future, of coming home to a kid on the stairs, still with her fur coat, still performing from the past, so on. Then it cuts to her without the coat. This, too, is jarring, but the narrative freedom that Fosse takes advantage of is uncommon in musicals, not just from the period.And one last shot to mention the final one, as Grey finishes with his Goodbye bit, and the camera goes by in a slow, deliberate pan actors a scrambled mirror, looking out at the placid faces of the Nazis in the audience. This is, simply, just good artistry of a variety that in other hands might lead to pretension, but for Fosse is meant for any audience member to conceive of and understand. Overall Cabaret works for those expecting the pleasures of a movie musical and film buffs looking for something more turbulent love and relationships done to some imaginative direction that keeps things surprisingly grounded in reality.

But being just the well-done even original horror, doesn't make it outlive all the other works of the genre as sure it did. What I loved about Psycho (regarding that I don't love the Horror genre in the first place !) else being a brilliant case of Jekyll and Hyde as son and mother, or being that awesomely suspenseful and highly creepy, is that it got unique interpretation, and one talented inner meaning of its own that will give it the immortality it deserves. In short, this genre movie.. Got brains !Norman Bates is nothing but a rare perfect type of a person who lives the past and can't let it go. He is a clear proof that the strong clinging to the past, with losing the contact with the present, makes you a monster indeed ! Look at him, lost it after the murder of his mother, the time stopped in that sick point, and also him. So when he couldn't utterly face the truth, the reality, he had to continue living yesterday endlessly and dopily, which led him to be the freak he was. He managed to kill his days by killing his best dreams\/the nice girls, because he was a slave of his fear to face the world with his desires. Transforming into the most ravenous, as well as the most alive, stuffed animal in the house. Norman buried his mother so himself into this motel where only his demons were being comfortable. This old palace illustrated perpetually the dark bygone (the importunate sins) when we don't have the ability to break it away to become our chosen big tomb, and our dreams' slaughterhouse. Strange that nobody ever helped Norman, but since when anybody ever thinks of a troubled person like him in a greedy world runs after the money and the money only. Actually, it could be the reason why Norman Bates pulled off murdering whoever came to the damn motel, as he was stronger than them all since he doesn't want the money.I loved the classic bathtub's crime; it was new, frightful, and Hitch enjoyed handling it cinematically. However I adore the brief yet marvelously clever zoom-in on Norman's face while (John Gavin)'s character was beside the motel, yelling Arbogast..Arbogast after the latter's death, aside from being darkly expressing and distinctive at the 1950s' end, it's a slight touch confirms how Hitch was madly in love with the art of cinema. (Bernard Herrmann) is the best when it comes to create great horror music; I read once about making his music for black and white films into black and white feel too by his own special orchestration, this man got both the eloquent style and the commercial captivity superbly. I'm obsessed with the opening credits' hot score, it said it all, and it can infiltrate into your deepest nastiness, or deal with what's under your skin of the most awful thoughts ever. There is a historically sexual boldness in it, but unfortunately through Hitch's twisted mind, where sex means simply and eternally  Death ! (Just imagine a version of Psycho starring Marilyn Monroe. Mother must love this one !). I liked the idea of suppressed kid in Norman and how that could make him a serial killer in a way. The dialog was plain and deep if you catch on the film's main motif, and interesting also with its sarcastic indications at the second watching (Mother didn't feel like herself tonight!). For me, the most terrifying moment was when we have the chance finally to meet Mrs. Bates' face, but as for now, it's definitely the moment after when Norman as Mrs. Bates smiles at the camera's eye refusing to harm a fly and in one split second we saw the ghost of the real mother's empty skull while the mix of the lifted car\/the film's last shot; I believe Hitchcock made it confident that someone will see it as well as enjoy it in the assured next watching.

I'm sorry, but I can't stand them. Most of them (for me) have the same tiresome plots, the basis of which are always some so-called good character goes out to kill some so-called bad character (both characters are, on an added note, incredibly unlikeable). The whole movie is often tied together by scenes of unending gunfire, in which people (who you think are important but you can't be sure) are shot dead without ceremony and left there while the good character reaps the reward. I cannot abide westerns. So, when my mum finally convinced me to see Young Guns, I was (despite the presence of Keifer Sutherland) determined to despise it.Well, I finally found the best western. And it is this.Young Guns follows the story of William Billy the Kid Bonny (Emilio Estavez) and the gang of Regulators he was the pseudo-leader of during the Lincoln County War. The Regulators, which include(d) Josiah Doc Surlock (Keifer Sutherland), Richard Dick Brewer (Charlie Sheen), and Jose Chavez Y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), all wanted revenge for the cold-blooded murder of their friend and mentor, John Tunstall. Having been deputized via a friend of Tunstall's, Alex McSween, the Regulators were admitted to kill certain men in their vendetta. After Billy's reckless slaughtering of folk not permitted to be slaughtered, the Regulators were branded outlaws, and became part of a county-wide manhunt that eventually led them to a final showdown with Tunstall's killers.A movie that is about friendship and politics just as much as it is about gunslinging, Young Guns is touching, exciting, and much more humorous than any western I've ever seen. It's the kind of movie that makes you smile at the end of it, an ending which is bittersweet and moving. Estavez's Billy the Kid is a slightly psychotic, annoying yet strangely likable anti-hero with a strong sense of loyalty that makes him the most interesting character in the movie. The Regulators, though coarse and somewhat awkward in their social abilities, are all quite affable in their own way, and you really get to care about them.Overall, Young Guns is not only a terrific western, but a terrific movie. While riddled with clichés and deep-down-but-not-so-far-from-the-surface messages, it still retains enough dignity to have true heart.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 December 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Let it be known that I hate westerns as a rule.

The whole movie is often tied together by scenes of unending gunfire, in which people (who you think are important but you can't be sure) are shot dead without ceremony and left there while the good character reaps the reward. I cannot abide westerns. So, when my mum finally convinced me to see Young Guns, I was (despite the presence of Keifer Sutherland) determined to despise it.Well, I finally found the best western. And it is this.Young Guns follows the story of William Billy the Kid Bonny (Emilio Estavez) and the gang of Regulators he was the pseudo-leader of during the Lincoln County War. The Regulators, which include(d) Josiah Doc Surlock (Keifer Sutherland), Richard Dick Brewer (Charlie Sheen), and Jose Chavez Y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), all wanted revenge for the cold-blooded murder of their friend and mentor, John Tunstall. Having been deputized via a friend of Tunstall's, Alex McSween, the Regulators were admitted to kill certain men in their vendetta. After Billy's reckless slaughtering of folk not permitted to be slaughtered, the Regulators were branded outlaws, and became part of a county-wide manhunt that eventually led them to a final showdown with Tunstall's killers.A movie that is about friendship and politics just as much as it is about gunslinging, Young Guns is touching, exciting, and much more humorous than any western I've ever seen. It's the kind of movie that makes you smile at the end of it, an ending which is bittersweet and moving. Estavez's Billy the Kid is a slightly psychotic, annoying yet strangely likable anti-hero with a strong sense of loyalty that makes him the most interesting character in the movie. The Regulators, though coarse and somewhat awkward in their social abilities, are all quite affable in their own way, and you really get to care about them.Overall, Young Guns is not only a terrific western, but a terrific movie. While riddled with clichés and deep-down-but-not-so-far-from-the-surface messages, it still retains enough dignity to have true heart.9\/10 ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"21 December 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Let it be known that I hate westerns as a rule.

It is a powerful, character driven film about the relationship of these three sisters (or lack there of) and their struggle to communicate. It's about the difficulty in letting yourself be touched by others, and the vulnerability that comes from opening yourself up.Maria and Karin are emotionally crippled characters; Maria is an adulteress who hides behind her flirtations and is unable to handle any sort of confrontation and Karin is a sadomasochist who is completely unable to express herself. They are different and alienated sisters who have not had any real communication since they were children. Even after a night of bonding and talking heart to heart, things seem to go back to the way they were before, as if Bergman were saying that opening up and touching (both emotionally and physically) are important first steps, but don't seem to actually solve anything in the long run by themselves.Anna is a character in contrast to these two sisters. She seems to be the only one who is capable of unconditional love and provides the most warmth and comfort for Agnes as she is dying, despite the fact that she has arguably suffered the most from loss in her life.I found Agnes to be the most interesting character. She took pleasure in the littlest things in life, such as a stroll through the garden with her sisters at the onset of her illness or later simply gazing out the window when she has the strength. She seems to be the only sister who takes complete solace and refuge in the presence of the other two (I sometimes got the feeling that Maria and Karin wanted Agnes to die a bit faster). The final line in the movie, a quote from Agnes' journal, shows her appreciation and love for those around her and for what life has given her, stating she is thankful for the presence of her sisters. I found this particularly bittersweet it is good to know Agnes felt so good around her sisters but I seriously doubt her sisters ever really felt the same about her. The question I always have about Agnes is whether she had this profound love and appreciation for love before she got sick, or if this love came because she got sick. I like to think that it was the former (based, for instance, on the priest's words about her) but people do tend to feel this towards the end of their lives more. Most likely, it is a combination of the two.The film is beautifully shot, with deep tones of red complementing the rest of the rather white and monotonous backdrop. The film is beautiful and will leave you thinking about life and meaning and love and alienation as only a Bergman film can. A very powerful film.

Lord Hidetora is superiorly awesome (especially when he turns mad) and Lady Kaede at times seems to be even more ruthless than Nurse Ratched (was in One flew over cuckoo's nest). Also, so many subtle and some not so-subtle references to Buddha are timely and apt. However, I would confess that movie is not perfect - the attack on the third castle is more or less ordinary, and I do wonder how even in that wilderness, Kyoami was able to maintain squeaky clean clothes for himself and his master.

'Slow' is how many reviewers describe the pace, but 'slow' implies that the pace could have been improved by a speeding up of the scenes. However, the pace is perfect. Rather than 'slow', I like to describe the scenes as being 'extended' (as opposed to exaggerated, extreme, or protracted, which, like 'slow', are words that imply imperfection). In Once Upon A Time In The West the action is extended over time intervals that allow the viewer to think and reflect and ponder on what is being observed. It's as if Leone has slowed down time, and what we reflect and ponder about is more than just the scene, which reflect an America that we never knew.

","genre":"Western"},{"date":"21 December 2008","score":"","review":" Don't get me wrong, this is an entirely entertaining movie, but by the time this one came out, the Rocky series was definitely running out of steam. Once again we find our lovable protagonist in the fight of his life going up against a villain of super-human proportions. And once again he must overcome insurmountable odds to reclaim victory. This time Rocky isn't just battling for personal glory, but for freedom and democracy through-out the globe. The Cold War is an obvious inspiration for this derivation of the Rocky formula.In this outing, Rocky must face his greatest foe yet a seven-foot tall Russian of unimaginable strength, Ivan Drago. You see, Drago visits the United States to begin his career in professional boxing and desires to begin with the reigning champ, Rocky Balboa. However, Apollo Creed, thirsting for another bout in the ring, jumps at this chance to rekindle his warrior's fire. So, after reluctantly agreeing to help his friend prepare for this seemingly easy exhibition match, Rocky watches in horror as Apollo is brutally cut down by the Russian. So now the rather thin plot of the movie unfolds. Rocky must face his inner demons and journey to Russia and defeat his friend's killer.It's pretty much by the numbers, not really straying from the Rocky formula. Nonetheless, Stallone is still able to produce a film that is watchable. He has basically taken the same concept of the original three movies and stripped it down to the bare bones, replacing cheesy montages for characterization and broad themes for introspection. One example of gloss over substance is a montage of Rocky dealing with his feelings after Apollo's death. It's like five minutes of clips from previous Rocky movies, even interspersing footage from earlier in Rocky IV! Did they really think that a overly long montage could replace some seriously needed emotional depth? I guess they saved a few bucks not having to film any original material. But somehow it all still works. There are two training montages, both with Rocky in the unforgiving Russian wilderness, paralleled with Drago's training sessions in laboratories with high tech machinery. They are both pretty effective. Yes, the symbolism in this film are like broad paint brush strokes of two contrasting colors. Rocky is pretty straight ahead with little growth going on here. Yeah, he has to deal with his friend's death, but it's not like we hadn't seen this somber, sobering side of Rocky in the other three movies. Rocky and Creed's friendship was basically reduced to watching old reels of their fights together and calling each other by their nicknames. I couldn't count how many times Apollo referred to Rocky simply as Stallion. Adrian's role in this movie was basically reduced to the disapproving then supportive spouse who gives Rocky that final push of inspiration to overcome. Gone is the affable wall flower of the earlier movies. She is basically a cardboard version of her earlier incarnations. Paulie is there to basically complain about everything.Stallone also missed a chance with his villain, in my opinion. Drago, portrayed well by Dolph Lundgren, is a physically impressive heavy, but that is about it. He has a few lines, though they are some pretty good one liners, but other than that Rocky could have just been fighting a Kodiak bear for all that it mattered. There are hints that this character is more than just a brutish fighting machine. Perhaps Stallone left this up for the viewer to decide if Ivan Drago is really evil, unlike Mr. T's Clubber Lange from the earlier movie who was overtly so, but in the end he seems as flat and uninspired as the rest of the film.The final fight is rather anticlimactic. The actual choreography is pretty shoddy as you can tell some of the hits aren't even close to connecting. No one ever blocks a punch, except maybe with their face, and there is no emotion here. Yeah, their corners are screaming at their respective fighters, and Rocky and Drago exchange some intense looks from across the ring, but it really adds up to not much as we know that Rocky isn't going to lose. In fact, after taking a beating from a fighter who registers 2000 psi per punch, and killed Creed in less than two rounds, Rocky seems less beat up than he did from his first fight with Apollo. Whatever.As I was watching this movie again recently, I was wondering what exactly the final message was. It starts off like a pretty straight forward revenge flick of sorts, but near the end, Rocky is giving a speech to the entire USSR about change and brotherhood or something. I guess on further exploration, it could be trying to say that in the end, our emotions shouldn't rule our decision making and that we all have room to change, e.g. Apollo trying to regain his glory and impulsively entering a fight he couldn't win, Rocky pursuing revenge even though it wouldn't bring his friend back, and I guess even to a lesser extent Drago desiring to demolish his enemies in a sport that doesn't necessarily warrant it. But who am I kidding. This film doesn't require or even request its' viewers to think that deep, unlike the original. It thrives on pure adrenaline, with a pumping sound track and fast paced montages. All in all, there is about half of a real movie here. Stallone should have stopped right here, but I guess if people still love watching the underdog movies, even at the most superficial level, why end a sure thing?One last thought Wouldn't it have been cool if Rocky went into the fight sporting that sweet beard he was growing there while training? Would have shown how raw he got out there in Siberia or wherever the hell he was. Now that would have been change we all could agree on!
