Voight was 30 and unknown, while  Dustin Hoffman (Rico Ratzo) was 31 when it was filmed, just coming off The Graduate. I was 23 when it came out and recall seeing a more mature Voight. Today, viewing the 1998 VHS re-issue I see a very young Voight. Only now, with his film history established, can we see what a fine actor he already was, perfectly characterizing a simple and naive dishwasher from Big Spring, Texas, who goes to NYC to become a hustler, cashing in on all the rich women there who are willing to pay for 'IT', he tells a fellow dishwasher.Joe is admitedly not very smart, almost a 'Forrest Gump', and grows up around his grandmother who calls him lover boy and always tells him he is the best-looking guy around. Flashback images even hint that he may have been sexually abused, but that is not clear nor necessary to explain his formation. As a young adult he declares, The only thing I've ever been good at is loving, meaning the sex act which rhymes with his last name.Dressed in a cowboy outfit, boots, colorful shirt, and his portable radio as his constant companion, his bus trip to NYC is used to display total lack of sophistication, radio constantly at his ear. Finally getting a NYC station fills him with visions of beautiful, rich women just waiting for him, willing to enrich him in return for his 'services.'  Having a bit of money saved, and thinking he will strike it rich, he eagerly spends it on others around him, drinks for everyone, and my friend here. But Joe gets a quick wake-up call, doesn't realize that he is being hustled by others, including the sick and homeless 'Ratzo', soon finding himself broke, locked out of his hotel room, without even being able to get his suitcase that looked like a former-time Gateway Computer box with a handle.Joe and Ratzo become an unlikely pair, Ratzo owing him for having cheated Joe out of $20, Joe needing a place to stay, ending up in the ratty unheated apartment in a condemned building. Ratzo coughs a lot, sweats, can hardly walk, it is obvious that he can't last too much longer. He only dreams and longs to go to Florida and, in a funny and whimsical dream scene we see him and Joe running on the beach. Not only is Ratzo running without a limp, he runs faster than Joe, as they are laughing and having a great time. There are several other funny scenes, which fit perfectly into the story and are not forced at all. In one, Joe kicks open a lock on a street shoeshine stand, and gets into the chair as Ratzo begins to shine his boots. Soon a pair of shoes appear next to the boots, the camera pans and we see a police officer. As Ratzo works on the second pair, another client shows up. In another, during the winter, ice coming out of the faucet, and Joe and Ratzo have to do a little dance in the apartment to keep from freezing too!Ratzo says, Frankly, you're beginning to smell, and for a stud in New York that's a handicap. Joe was getting near the bottom. He found a little mnoney by selling his blood. He had to hock his radio for $5. This metaphorically represented his finally severing any connection with the real world which he imagined, and then could he complete his journey into a personal hell, from which he might seek redemption. In the ugliest scene in the movie he is in a hotel room with a man, desperately needs money for bus tickets to get his sick friend, Ratzo, to Florida. He hits the old man, then stuffs and turns the black phone into the man's mouth, which is one of the very few scenes I remember from 30+ years ago. It isn't totally clear, but we feel that he killed the man, the deepest and darkest point of his desperate young life.Joe and Ratzo finally get to Florida, buy some tropical clothes, Joe stuffs all his cowboy getup into a trash can, and Joe tells Ratzo, I don't think I'm really cut out to be a hustler. I'm going to get a real job, something outdoors. Joe is growing up. He still has to live with his errors, he still has to make his new dreams happen, but the film is about the chapter in his life that had just concluded with his awakening.Ratzo becomes unresponsive, as Joe talks to him in the adjacent bus seat. As they are arriving into the Miami area, Ratzo has died. But he got to Florida first. Joe can only put his arm around Ratzo, while his eyes reveal a thousand things going on inside.

As for the TV series terrible! Don't waste your time on that. But the movie is a different story. It is really nice to see so many talented young actors together, especially because most of them were new to the public and had not (yet) made a name for themselves. Most of the comments on this movie have focused on C. Thomas Howell, Rob Lowe and Matt Dillon, so I will not comment on them. They are great, don't get me wrong, but I feel that everything has been said already. The most beautiful performance (in my opinion) is given by Ralph Macchio, who seems to get a little forgotten in most reviews. It is hard to believe he was really 21 and 22 years old when the movie was made. He is usually one of those actors of whom people would think he can't do anything besides look cute and play some kind of kid, but trust me, he can really act. He plays Johnny Cade, a scared and troubled 16-year-old who is not wanted at home and who is a member of the Greasers, one of the 2 gangs. The other gang are the Socs, the rich boys who are from the other side of town. Some of Macchio's best scenes are actually the ones in which he is not the key figure. For example, the scene in the movie drive-in where his fellow Greaser Dallas is bothering the 2 girls and the scene in which the Socs follow Johnny, Ponyboy, one of their friends and the 2 girls after they leave the drive-in and Ponyboy and the other Greaser prepare to fight the Socs with a knife and a piece of glass. The part of the movie where Ponyboy and Johnny are staying at the abandoned church is really nice too. The most memorable scenes by Macchio are naturally the ones in which Johnny is the main character, like the scene in which Johnny talks about committing suicide and the scenes that deal with the confrontation with the Socs, Johnny killing one of them and Johnny telling Ponyboy that he killed that boy. The fire scene seems a little odd, but that is just because it is unlogical for it to be in the movie and that has more to do with the script than with any of the boys's acting. Macchio clearly shows he can do more than just be cute.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"5 February 2003","score":"22 out of 33 people found the following review useful","review":"  The Three Amigos is one of those movies that can be hugely entertaining and amusing but only if you keep in mind that it is not a serious film. Chevy Chase, Martin Short, and Steve Martin, some of the funniest men ever to work in comedy, all team up here as The Three Amigos, a group of out of work actors in early Hollywood cinema. The unfortunate thing is that this is not a movie that is greater than the sum of its parts, since I would expect more from actors with the caliber of Martin, Chase, and Short, even working individually, but even the fact that they are all not used to their full potential is not enough to bring down the rest of the comedy here.The story involves the three out of work silent film actors, who suddenly find themselves unemployed and broke when they receive a telegram from a small village in Mexico desperately asking their assistance. I liked how clever the ploy was where the woman who sent the message was so poor that she could not afford enough words to make her desires clear, so the Amigos read the message and think that they are about to be paid a fortune just to make an appearance in this village. Naturally they jump at the chance since they have nothing better to do.Most of the rest of the film deals with their adventures in this village, which they are supposed to be protecting from an evil villain but do not realize that this is real life until one of them gets shot. You would think that they would have caught on sooner, but on the other hand, they DID happen to stumble into the only tiny village in Mexico where no one speaks Spanish, so it's not hard to understand why they thought the whole thing was a set up. If I went to Mexico and was walking around a dusty village with nothing but endless desert on every side and every single person was speaking only English, I would also wonder what movie set I had just wandered onto.

There's no showy Pick up the gun..., Garciella is a woman stuck in a bad situation and Eastwood's entire life history isn't picked apart for the benefit of one final kill.Eastwood plays his character very well; a guy recently out of a heart transplant and very much in his later years, who you can feel for and really don't want him to push it too much.  He probably didn't find this part too taxing, frankly, but excellent actors don't need to push their limits to make us believe them.The plots links work reasonably well - the clues in the crime don't appear to lead anywhere helpful and there's no real major revelations.  Again, it comes across as believable.Parts where it approaches unbelievable are kept well-balanced; the follow-up from the 'intimate scene' is good because too many films have done it the other way (you'll see what I mean).It's a good story, well told, for (as one reviewer said here) the adult audience, and well directed.What I didn't like The 'intimate scene' between Eastwood and the woman (won't tell you who).  A little cringe-worthy and just beyond believable because you're pretty much expecting it - every hollywood movie has it.  But they kept it to a minimum.I (being a pessimistic movie-goer) was expecting the killer to be who he\/she\/it\/they was from around half-way.  Before that and anyone who says they know who did it is purely speculating, there is nothing approaching concrete to substantiate it.  Though it was kind of good to realise it early.I think they could have traded the Russian character (being somewhat superfluous, IMHO) with some time showing that it should be harder for an ex-agent to get at sensitive files, but I understand the decision because it may have got simply tiring.All in all, a good movie if you want a bit of Eastwood and tension and maybe you're feeling old today.

I mean, let's be honest, the acting and dialog in the Star Wars series has always been more a matter of competence than brilliance, it was the wonderful imagination and groundbreaking visual effects that made them great.That said, my feelings about the new films are thus The Phantom Menace is definitely underrated, sure Jar Jar is annoying and Lucas was a fool to throw in those references to the Midicloridians sp? and Annakin's `virgin' birth, but these can be easily overlooked (as Lucas himself seems to have done, since nowhere in this film are they mentioned). Phantom Menace has the same epic quality that made the other three great - sweeping vistas, beautiful scenery, and a plot that takes its time developing; after all, there's a lot of background to establish. And when I saw this in the theater, I was most pleased, figuring it would finally shut up all the critics who hated TPM. But, truth be told, after buying it on DVD, my enthusiasm has waned. Giving credit where due, the effects are still outstanding and so are the action scenes, but the `epic' quality is lacking. Lucas seems much too eager to show off his technical skills, and too much effort was put into developing great action sequences at the expense of basic plot and character development. For example, it is crucial for the plot for Annakin and Padme to fall in love, but in this movie they just don't have any chemistry. Put aside the problem of the fact that he ages over a decade while she barely ages at all, I can willingly suspend some belief here, but their basic characters just don't gell. She is dignified and wise beyond her years, and would surely see that Annakin, despite his talents and good intentions, is seriously unbalanced. To be fair, I don't think it's either actor's fault, in fact, the `clunky' dialog between them struck me as refreshingly realistic, the way real first time lovers speak, awkward and tongue-tied as opposed to the usual slick Hollywood product of highly paid professional writers, but no amount of acting or writing can save a romance that seems as forced and unrealistic as this one does.As for the rest, the pairing of Annakin and Obi Wan is quite good; the former clearly respects his mentor but also resents his often-domineering manner and it's fairly obvious that there will be a violent falling out between these two in Episode III. There are a number of memorable scenes, including the one on the water planet where we first meet Boba Fett and his father, a beautifully filmed space dogfight in an asteroid belt, and of course the climactic final battle scene. No question but that Lucas has not lost his touch for SFX laden action scenes, although I personally found the fight between Yoda and Count Dooku to have been a bit silly, like watching an attack hamster on speed. The problem is Lucas seems to have lost sight of the larger story. While Annakin and Padme are frolicking on Naboo and Obi Wan is chasing after a mysterious assassin, in the background the Republic is faced with division as thousands of star systems threaten to secede. Why? Who knows, Lucas is far too busy on scenes like the one in which Annakin and Padme have to fight off a bunch of bug people to explore this seemingly vital matter more fully. And the Clone Army, we are shown in much detail how they are made, but not why, which is surely the more important issue. In short, the problem with this movie is the story simply takes a back seat to the action, and what we get is a highly competent piece of entertainment, but an effort that doesn't quite measure up to the standard of being a truly epic film like the others in the series.

Now it's Burkitsville. With two video cameras they head out into town to interview the townspeople on what they knew about the Blair Witch. Some people knew nothing, others, like an old lady that lived outside of town, had an encounter with her! They talked about how many children were kidnapped and killed back in the 1940s. What's more, some say the Blair Witch still haunts the Black Hills woods. That evening, Heather, Josh and Michael kick back in their hotel room awaiting the next day when they'd trek into the woods and visit Coffin Rock and the cemetary. Little did they know that the next day would start the most terrifying chain of events either of them had ever anticipated!The three drive out to the woods, load up their limited camping gear and head off. Little did they know they would never see the car again. Heather leads the way because she knew the way. Or so she said. She videotaped the entire hike. They taped Coffin Rock and the child cemetary then they camp out for the night. They hear some odd noises in the night. Next day, they tape some more and would start home the following day. They argue a little. That night, they hear more creepy sounds. Was somebody out there? Nobody responded to their shouts. The next day, they awaken and find piles of rocks around their tent. They weren't there when they pitched it. Who put them there? Also, Heather finds her map missing. Who took it? Josh and Michael deny accusations but Michael later confesses that he kicked it into the river. What compelled him to do such a stupid thing? He thought the map was doing them no good. Heather and Josh freaked out. They then began wandering around, going the way they thought was the right way, quarreling every step of the way. Heather still had her camcorder fired up. They continue walking until nightfall. It seemed as though the woods went on forever. They found some weird figures made from sticks hanging from trees. Like voodoo signs made from sticks. It was all too creepy and what's more, that night, they heard more creepy sounds. They didn't sound like ordinary animal sounds! They even heard children shouting! The next day, they continued to try and find a way out of the woods but with no such luck. The morale dropped even more so and the next day, Michael and Heather awaken to find Josh missing! They looked all over and couldn't find him.Heather found what she thought were...Parts of Josh wrapped in a bunch of sticks wrapped with shreds of Josh's jacket! She and Michael keep going. The two were now suffering hunger and complete fright. They wandered around aimlessly and passed the same river twice. Were they going in circles. No, that wasn't possible because they headed south all day. Something strange was going on! At night, Heather videotaped herself apologizing to her family, Josh's family and Michael's. She was too scared to close her eyes or even open them for they were being hunted by someone...Or something! Later that night, they hear a man shouting for help so they follow the cries to an old run-down house in the middle of the woods! They run upstairs then run downstairs and fall prey to someone...Or maybe worse someTHING!Quite possibly the scariest movie ever made! It's done in a different fashion where we see what the characters see so we are afraid of what they're afraid of. This new technique might very well revolutionize the way we view horror movies in the future! There was one part of the film I didn't understand right after the Blair Witch attacked the tent, one of them runs off and Heather is running after him. The one she's chasing, either Josh or Michael, picks up a strange object which was something Heather was obviously afraid of because she shouts, Oh my God! What the **** is that??!! Now please help me, WHAT WAS THAT OBJECT SHE WAS SO AFRAID OF?! For the life of me, I can't figure it out; Was followed by Book of Shadows Blair Witch 2 which was really stupid, DESPITE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK!!

Now it's Burkitsville. With two video cameras they head out into town to interview the townspeople on what they knew about the Blair Witch. Some people knew nothing, others, like an old lady that lived outside of town, had an encounter with her! They talked about how many children were kidnapped and killed back in the 1940s. What's more, some say the Blair Witch still haunts the Black Hills woods. That evening, Heather, Josh and Michael kick back in their hotel room awaiting the next day when they'd trek into the woods and visit Coffin Rock and the cemetary. Little did they know that the next day would start the most terrifying chain of events either of them had ever anticipated!The three drive out to the woods, load up their limited camping gear and head off. Little did they know they would never see the car again. Heather leads the way because she knew the way. Or so she said. She videotaped the entire hike. They taped Coffin Rock and the child cemetary then they camp out for the night. They hear some odd noises in the night. Next day, they tape some more and would start home the following day. They argue a little. That night, they hear more creepy sounds. Was somebody out there? Nobody responded to their shouts. The next day, they awaken and find piles of rocks around their tent. They weren't there when they pitched it. Who put them there? Also, Heather finds her map missing. Who took it? Josh and Michael deny accusations but Michael later confesses that he kicked it into the river. What compelled him to do such a stupid thing? He thought the map was doing them no good. Heather and Josh freaked out. They then began wandering around, going the way they thought was the right way, quarreling every step of the way. Heather still had her camcorder fired up. They continue walking until nightfall. It seemed as though the woods went on forever. They found some weird figures made from sticks hanging from trees. Like voodoo signs made from sticks.

That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Don't listen to the people on the message board. Blue Crush isn't the best movie of 2002 but it definitely isn't the worst. Kate Why in the world did I do Rules of Attraction? Bosworth plays Anne Marie, a young girl who is forced into the role of mother to her younger sister (played quite well by Mika Boorem) when her mom runs off to Vegas with a man. Michelle Rodriguez plays Eden, Anne Marie's coach who lives vicariously through her when it comes to surfing. Surf star Sanoe Lake makes a convincing debut as a surfer girl and this is the inner circle of friends for the movie. Most of the surfing footage is edited quite well and the only thing I found to be really cheesy is the end shot (if you've seen Blue Crush you know what I mean). Rodriguez once again plays a tough girl (can she play anything else?) who is more driven by Anne Marie's goals than Anne Marie. I could've done without the love interest side story between Anne Marie and Matt, the NFL quarterback in Hawaii for what I presume is the Pro Bowl. I get that they were drawing parallels between Anne Marie and her mother (both have men wanting to whisk them away). Extras are cast quite well and you really get to appreciate the gorgeous scenery that is Hawaii throughout the movie. On the level of a surfing movie this works. The huge waves, competition, and girls in bikinis were all quite enjoyable. The side stories weren't as good although I did enjoy the football players and their antics. In the end you really felt for Anne Marie and Bosworth does a great job carrying off the character. There was great chemistry between the 3 surfer girls and that really showed in the movie. Props for most of the cast doing as much of their own stunts as possible as well. If you like good looking kids in paradise, this is the movie for you. Some of the unneeded cheeseyness takes points away but for a mindless summertime flick, I have to endorse Blue Crush.*DVD includes loads of extras including commentary by Bosworth, Rodriguez, and Lake who arrives late (must have been surfing) and commentary by Stockwell. Music videos, surfing terms, a behind the scenes look at the making of the film makes the extras strong.* ***7\/10 stars***      ","genre":null},{"date":"5 February 2003","score":"","review":"  Ok, going into this movie, I did not have the highest of expectations.

And especially if it could be the day he takes off from school, with friends Cameron and Sloane, journeying into downtown Chicago impersonating the rich and famous while capturing the hearts of an entire city? Ferris represents everything all high school boys want to be funny, good-looking, quick, charming, conniving yet smart, and popular. Having a girlfriend as hot as Sloan Peterson doesn't hurt either. And driving a Ferrari helps. What really won me over about his character was Ferris' ability to talk his way through conflicts and problems. Perhaps it is his strategic way of thinking I envy. When faced with similar confrontations (i.e. the restaurant scene with the `snooty' host), I'd probably crack and then wet my pants. Ferris was able to, though non-violently and painlessly, deceive people, achieve his goal, and make himself look like the good guy all while doing so. It's this ability I find so intriguing and sexy. In a way, yes, this movie told kids it's okay to lie and do the wrong thing. But it also taught kids not to give up in the face of opposition. But who really cares what the underlying message is? Movies are made to help one escape miserable reality for 2 hours. In those two hours I imagined myself as Ferris Bueller, conquering the world, singing in a parade, being ogled by beautiful dancers, and tooling around in a Ferrari. This life is a dream come true- as long as you ignore the final scene, which I suppose the director\/writer John Hughes included to help movie-goers prepare for re-entry back into their pathetic and dreary lives.

This one was set in Iran, but presumably thousands of American women married to men in these countries are virtually imprisoned, not allowed basic freedoms, including the freedom to return to the USA. Or perhaps other western countries. I was in one of the Arab countries for a week in 1991 and what is depicted in this film is very accurate.The story - SPOILERS FOLLOW - it is 1984 and Betty is happily married to an Iranian-born doctor, and they have a 5-year-old daughter. We see them as a typical well-off American family, fishing in the lake in Michigan (filmed in Georgia) and having a family outing with the in-laws. At the hospital fellow doctors are making uncomplimentary remarks about Iranian doctors, and kids at school to the daughter. Plus, his large extended family back in Iran (formerly Prussia) are putting pressure on him to return. Betty is afraid to go for a short visit, but her husband swears on the Koran that he will see that they remain safe, and they will return home in the US after a two-week visit.When they arrive in Iran, the large family celebration looks more like a grand homecoming, which is what it was. After two weeks he told Betty they weren't going back, in Iran she is his property and she has no independent rights. When she argued, he hit her in the face with his fist. At one point, when her father was ill back in the states, and she wanted to travel to visit him, she would not be allowed to bring her daughter. She said, Not without my daughter will I leave, thus the title.  Betty and her daughter were there for almost two years before they finally escaped, taking a dangerous route across one border, risking their lives for freedom.  She had spent most of that two-year period constantly trying to find a way to escape. Angered by her attempts at one point he told her, Try this again and I will kill you.  That coming from  her husband with whom she lived such a normal life just months earlier. All in the name of his religious beliefs.The DVD is relatively sharp, but not reference quality. There is only one short extra of note, and it is a making of which also includes some comments from the real Betty.  Good film, still can't figure out why it has a relatively low IMDb rating.

Confidential may very well be the best detective\/crime film of all time.1950s Los Angeles is a city gripped by organized crime.  And when reputed mob boss Mickey Cohen is imprisoned, a dangerous and mysterious battle begins amongst those who vie to replace him.  Detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce), a rising (yet unpopular) young star in the L.A. police force, volunteers to investigate a grizzly multiple homicide at a local café, and ends up right smack in the middle of the crime war.  With the aid of fellow officers like wise guy Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) and brutish Bud White (Russell Crowe), Exley sets a course to unravel the truth behind the mystery and settle the score...even if it means not playing by the rules.Director Curtis Hanson (Eight Mile) and writer Brian Helgeland (Conspiracy Theory) combined their talents wonderfully to create a movie that is very fun and riveting, yet they avoided the rampant sensationalism that usually characterizes films of this genre.  So the final product is realistic and believable, but at the same time, surprisingly exclusive of dull scenes and useless, boring chatter.  Its success in this matter qualifies L.A. Confidential as an excellent start-to-finish film because it is enjoyable all the way through.Despite its commendable writing, commanding performances given by a great group of actors (most of whom were just hitting their stride) make the film. Spacey plays the self-sustaining Hollywood Cop to perfection and Pearce is incredible in the lead (his performance in this movie rivals the one he gave in Memento).  I consider this movie to be Russell Crowe's breakout performance--his thuggish yet sensitive role as Bud White was probably the film's most powerful, and may have set the course for some of his future casting.  Kim Basinger won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as primo prostitute Lynn Bracken, and was quite deserving. Other strong performances were given by James Cromwell, Danny DeVito and David Strathairn.L.A. Confidential is a classic in its time and a must-see for all movie fans who can expect to have a great time watching a great film.
