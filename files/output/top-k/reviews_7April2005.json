I first came to know the rather unique director from his infamous DRILLER KILLER... Which is really 90 minutes of my life I'd like to have back. It's the one DVD I own that I'd love to not own. The one DVD I don't even CONSIDER rewatching. And with good reason. It's a jackass of a film. I can't go into it any more without swearing, and then my review won't get put up. Anyway, years after watching that...movie, I began to wonder how Ferarra is so known among film fans. Nobody likes The Driller Killer, so that can't be it. I looked him up here, and saw that such noted actors as Christopher Walken and Harvey Keitel have worked with him!! I was quite surprised and then I came across this one rather cheap. And I love gangster films so maybe I'm being a bit biased here.But this one was rather interesting. These aren't Scorsese style gangsters. They're guys in black suits but their life is much less glamarous. There is much rape and violence and little laughs or friendship. The film focuses on three brothers.. Christopher Walken is legendary in his role as wise but aging family head Ray. Chris Penn plays his rather temperamental (surprise surprise, it being Chris Penn) brother, and Vincent Gallo plays young foolish brother Johnny.The film opens with the recently deceased Johnny lying in his coffin and everyone gathered around crying. How did he get to be there? The film tells this through flashbacks which occur every few minutes throughout the film, and we also see a part from Ray's youth. Very skilfully done! The time switching happens without us noticing, the film flows so well that we're not in the least bit distracted.Christopher Walken is Christopher Walken in a Christopher Walken role, Ray... He's taking the Michael Corleone route here, the wise guy, the darker older brother who makes all the decisions for the family. And he's great at it... Chris Penn is Chris Penn in another Chris Penn role. He's completely insane. A brutal, angry man who loses it over nothing and spends his time on screen shouting and swearing at those around him. Chris Penn is really good at this, but I'd like to see him take on an emotional character... He's just doing Nice Guy Eddie over and over again. Vincent Gallo does the Freddie Corleone of the family well, but he's a bit unbelievable as a gangster and the camera has too many close ups on him. Also present in a supporting role is John Ventimiglia, who plays Artie Bucco from The Sopranos! Just thought I'd mention him, brilliant man. There's Benicio Del Toro as the rival gangster boss. He's pretty creepy but doesn't have a big enough part to do the character justice. Overall, the acting out of the two leads - Walken and Penn - is excellent. Typical, but excellent.Ferarra's been known to be violent and disturbing. Maybe if I'd watched this film a few years back it might have affected me, but it didn't in the least. I am now immune to offense by violence. Some of the film's violent highlights, though, include a stabbing in the heart with a butcher knife, shooting two innocent truck drivers with a shotgun, raping a teenage prostitute (who sold her soul) and an ending pistol massacre.Despite all this, however, it's an excellent if depressing picture, with many deep and dark performances. The violence is not over the top compared to the likes of De Palma or Scorsese, and it is not disturbing, or maybe that's just me.I will definitely be seeing more Ferarra movies!

I've always been interested in history and that murder is of course an important event in the twentieth century.It seems to me that Oliver Stone has made his trademark of making movies about historically important people or events and conspiracy theories. His latest movie of that kind was Alexander, but he also made movies about Nixon and John F. Kennedy and produced many others. I've always been an admirer of his work. I liked The People vs. Larry Flynt, I appreciated Nixon and Natural Born Killers and saw many others like Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July. But J.F.K may well be the best movie he has made so far.It gives a good idea of everything that happened the 22nd November, 1963. It is a mixture of actual facts and speculations, but it is all done in such a way that it is very believable. Of course, there isn't any proof of what is sometimes said, but this isn't a documentary either, it's a movie, so there doesn't always have to be proof of all that is stated.It's a movie that is full of drama and suspense, but it is a lot more than some cheap entertainment. It gives us the story of New Orleans District Attorney, Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), who re-opens the files on the investigation and takes a critical look at the facts given by the F.B.I. Because of the fact that he keeps asking questions and keeps poking his nose where it shouldn't be, the people who had something to do with the murder get anxious. His own life and that of his family is at risk, but he keeps looking for the truth and finally finds a trail...Normally I'm not a fan of movies that mix facts and fiction, but when it is done in such a way as it was done in this movie, than I can only admire the good work. It's very clear that everything that is stated in the movie may not be certain, but that it's all very plausible. The people who wrote this story didn't just want to make some easy entertainment, they tried to give their vision on the truth.

You could say it is the sickest thing ever being recorded and no-one would say you're wrong and yet it's also so incredibly funny and interesting at the same time that it keeps you watching until the end.In this movie we see Ben whose every move is being followed by a camera crew. But Ben isn't an ordinary man. He's a serial killer who makes a living by killing mailmen, old and lonely people (Let's call them the easy targets), not just for the money, but also because of the fun of it. He never works in a neighborhood full of villa's, but only in social housing complexes. Why that is? Well, his philosophy is if you kill a wale, Greenpeace and all other 'tree huggers' will condemn you, but if you catch some sardines, they will help you to put them in tins... At first the camera crew has a lot of difficulties to cope with all the violence, but as longer as they stay with Ben, they not only get immune for all the violence, but become more violent themselves.This isn't just an excellent and ultra-dark satirical movie about a serial killer. If you look a bit closer you'll understand that the director gives us a more profound message with his film we all get more and more immune to violence and we don't seem to care about other people anymore. And to make things worse, the media will do anything to give us the goriest pictures we all seem to want. The rape scene is a good example of that statement. Many people don't understand why it was in the movie, but in the mean time they kept watching, didn't they? In my opinion, people who don't see this message, haven't understood anything about the movie and I guess that's the main reason why so many people seem to hate it. Something else that might confuse the audience is the documentary style of filming. Don't be mistaken, this isn't a documentary, this is a fictive story that could have been based on actual events, but that really isn't.What makes me proud is the fact that this is one of ours. I'm Belgian myself and I can tell you that, despite the fact that many Belgian directors have filmed several movies, almost none of them has been able to make such a great movie.

Being one of the earlier scripts penned by John Hughes, who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of his work Weird Science as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great Gary U.S Bonds.What more can i say, it's a movie just waiting to be rediscovered, time and time again.

As a priest, Father Delaney (Rod Steiger), blesses the home, he realizes with horror that something evil is lingering there. The dream house is turning into a nightmare.Sometimes our affection for or aversion to an artwork that we've been exposed to a number of times over the years is inextricably enmeshed with our historical, emotional experiences, whether we admit this or not. For example, I strongly dislike soap operas, or indeed any dramas that resemble soap operas. This is probably due to the fact that for years my only exposure to soap operas was when I was home sick from school as a kid. These were the days before cable television and home video. In the middle of a weekday afternoon, you either watched soap operas or you didn't watch television. Subconsciously, I associate soap operas with a feeling of illness.Likewise, Jay Anson's Amityville Horror novel appeared when I was still a teen. I loved it. I can still remember reading it in one long sitting--something I rarely did--in the family car as we drove from Florida to Ohio to visit relatives. I was excited when the film appeared, and liked it a lot at the time.So although I can see many faults with Amityville Horror now, I still have a deep affection for it that triggers my brain to go into an apologetic mode and defend the film. I just can't bring myself to give it lower than an 8 out of 10, and even that seems low to me. But I can easily see how audiences lacking a history with the film might dislike it. It is relatively slow, uneventful and meandering--with a modern perspective, the pacing and subtlety are reminiscent of some recent Asian horror. At the same time, maybe paradoxically, scenery chewing has only rarely had a greater ally.Just a couple days ago MGM released newly remastered widescreen versions of Amityville 1, 2 and 3. I haven't seen the film look this good since seeing it in the theater in 1979, and it probably didn't even look this good then. The first thing that struck me was how incredible much of the cinematography is. Director Stuart Rosenberg had an amazing knack for finding intriguing angles for shots and imbuing them with beautiful colors.Unlike recent trends, Rosenberg's colors are not narrowed down to a single scheme. For example, in some shots, such as some of the interiors of the famed Amityville house, we get fabulous combinations of pale greens and yellows. In others, such as many exterior shots near the house, we get intense combinations of fall foliage colors. There are also a number of beautiful shots of the famed eye window exterior of the house in differently tinted negative colors.Rosenberg evidences a great eye for placing his cast in the frame and shooting scenes to create depth and symbolism via objects that partially block or surround the frame. He also has a knack for creating winding, receding patterns of objects that enhance depth through perspective. My affection for this aspect of the film has little nostalgic attachment, as I didn't pay attention to such things as a kid (I didn't start noticing them more until I started painting, far into my adult years), and the positive aspects of the cinematography were hardly discernible on the previous, ridiculously bad pan & scan VHS release.Of course, most people aren't watching a film like this for the aesthetics of the visual composition. This is one of the most famous haunted house films, after all. The horror is handled somewhat awkwardly, occasionally absurdly, but it still works well enough for me, as understated as it is (I'm not referring to the acting, just the horror objects). Aspects such as the ubiquitous flies reminded me of similar motifs, such as water, in Hideo Nakata's horror films (such as Ringu, 1998 and Dark Water, 2002). The beginning of the film, showing the Defeo murders, still has a lot of shock value, despite its relative post-Tarantino tameness. Most of the horror elements are more portentous, but they're regular and interesting enough to hold your attention, as long as you don't mind subtlety.Subtlety, however, was the furthest thing from the cast's minds. Brolin, Kidder and especially Steiger shout their lines more often than they speak them. Overacting is not in their vocabularies. Kidder comments on an accompanying documentary that the horror genre walks a fine line between intensity and camp. That may or may not be true in general, but in Amityville Horror, camp is frequently broached. For me, it has a certain charm. I'm a fan of camp and so bad it's good; Amityville's performances often attain both.The commentary on the new DVD is amusing given the 1970s publicity that the book and film depicted a true haunting and the subsequent, thorough debunking by persons such as Stephen Kaplan. Hans Holzer, a parapsychologist who has been involved with the story since the early days, and the author of a book upon which Amityville II was based, provides the commentary. He presents himself as an academic, but he obviously seems to have little concern for objectivity or skepticism. He not only still talks about the story as true, he invents supernatural excuses for the DeFeo murders and then some, barely mentioning detractors such as Kaplan.If you haven't seen the film yet, you should base your viewing decision on whether you have a taste for deliberately paced horror as well as a tolerance for extremely over-the-top performances.

I never was that fan of comic books or super heroes, never even read those books or watched the animated series. So this review is based on a writer who is making a review of the movie alone with no references at all to the comic books or animated series. Well, maybe, just a bit.When X-Men came out to the theaters, I remember people were really excited. There was a boy who was almost dying in his chair before the movie even began, because of the excitement he was having and he even said This movie is gonna explode! Well, the movie began. In the first movie, we see characters like Wolwerine, Cyclops, Storm, Prof. Xavier, Magneto and some others, just to name the most famous ones. I really liked the cast of the movie, Halle Berry is not that bad as Storm as she is in other movies, but even so, Storm was a very easy role she took. Special effects add a lot to her performance, as she stroked Toad (Ray Park) with a thunder while her face was built on glowing white eyes and wind blowing through her hair. In this movie, we may say that Berry is not that bad, but it's not that great. The others are much greater. Starting with Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen), these two really perform seriously like they were the same characters from the novel. Magneto may not be looking physically the same way as in the comic books or the animated series, but still, the performance was what count the most. And the special effects and costumes a lot also. Oh, I almost forgot about Rogue (Anna Panquin). The screams she was known for to win the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role in The Piano (1993) are here in this movie too, in the beginning of it, when she first meet with her special powers. Wolwerine (Hugh Jackman) is great also, but I still think that his hair in the movie is horrible. It was a great hair for the animated series, but for the movie, it just seems a little weird and ugly. The only time his hair is actually good (or as we may say, natural) is when he wakes up from the bed in the scene where Jean Grey (Fanke Janssen) is about to give him a shot. She's also great in the movie and beautiful the same way she is in GoldenEye (1995).Well, all performances were great, special effects and all too. So, what am I complaining about? Well, I liked the plot and the school introduction too, even so, the plot seems to have been a little simple and the action is not that great. Maybe it was, but I really guess that the second movie was much greater. There are many more action sequences, the movie is longer, and more characters are introduced. It was a nice start for a marvel movie. But you should really watch X-Men, maybe if you are an X-Men fan, or maybe if you just want to see the movie, but the main reason in my opinion is that you should watch it just to watch X2 later on.

Well, I liked the plot and the school introduction too, even so, the plot seems to have been a little simple and the action is not that great.

I never was that fan of comic books or super heroes, never even read those books or watched the animated series. So this review is based on a writer who is making a review of the movie alone with no references at all to the comic books or animated series. Well, maybe, just a bit.When X-Men came out to the theaters, I remember people were really excited. There was a boy who was almost dying in his chair before the movie even began, because of the excitement he was having and he even said This movie is gonna explode! Well, the movie began. In the first movie, we see characters like Wolwerine, Cyclops, Storm, Prof. Xavier, Magneto and some others, just to name the most famous ones. I really liked the cast of the movie, Halle Berry is not that bad as Storm as she is in other movies, but even so, Storm was a very easy role she took. Special effects add a lot to her performance, as she stroked Toad (Ray Park) with a thunder while her face was built on glowing white eyes and wind blowing through her hair. In this movie, we may say that Berry is not that bad, but it's not that great. The others are much greater. Starting with Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen), these two really perform seriously like they were the same characters from the novel. Magneto may not be looking physically the same way as in the comic books or the animated series, but still, the performance was what count the most. And the special effects and costumes a lot also. Oh, I almost forgot about Rogue (Anna Panquin). The screams she was known for to win the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role in The Piano (1993) are here in this movie too, in the beginning of it, when she first meet with her special powers. Wolwerine (Hugh Jackman) is great also, but I still think that his hair in the movie is horrible. It was a great hair for the animated series, but for the movie, it just seems a little weird and ugly. The only time his hair is actually good (or as we may say, natural) is when he wakes up from the bed in the scene where Jean Grey (Fanke Janssen) is about to give him a shot.

And yet I must admit that this movie was actually not that bad, even though I feared the worst.When Gabe (Stallone) fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top, he can't possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger. For almost a year he doesn't set a food in the reserve, but than he returns. Soon after he's back, they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm. At least, that's what the rangers believe. In reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed. The cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them...This is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever, but in its genre it's an enjoyable one. I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers. I know him best from the TV-series 3rd Rock from the Sun, but I enjoyed his performance in this movie as well. Overall the acting is OK, it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one-liners, but it also offered a very nice decor. This movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment.

While I didn't doubt that the film would be good, I had my doubts if it could match the greatness of the novel, which I was truly blown away by. Needless to say... the movie is easily as good as the book, if not better, which is an occurrence that seems to happen less and less in movies these days. But with the Green Mile, director Frank Darabont and a superb cast have put together a truly touching and affecting story. Darabont, who also transferred the novel to a screenplay, is wise enough to know that Stephen King's original works are good enough without changing, and so he keeps virtually all spoken lines and events EXACTLY (and I'm not exaggerating) the same as in the novel, except for the odd time when he adds an extra line of dialogue or two to help clarify something the narrator originally said. This approach actually works out really well; it might have seemed patchy and awkward in a worst case scenario. Fortunately, the excellent cast is too experienced to let that happen. Tom Hanks, in one of his best performances yet, is wonderful as Paul Edgecomb, a prison guard on death row who comes across events he was by no means ready for. But it is safe to say that he is overshadowed (in more ways than one) by the simply wonderful performance given by Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, Edgecomb's prisoner who turns out to have 'special gifts'. It's a complex enough role as is, but Duncan brings so much more to Coffey than just crying and acting dim. Beneath Coffey's outward simple mindedness, (The name's John Coffey. Like the drink, 'cept not spelled the same.) there is a searing intelligence waiting just under the exterior, just enough for us to notice. Duncan really turns Coffey into a sympathetic character, and from the beginning, it is impossible to believe that Coffey was capable of raping and murdering two little girls - so much are we compelled to care about him. It is beyond me how Duncan could have lost out at the Oscars that year, one of the most potent examples, in my opinion, of how the Academy is more about politics than artistic merit.David Morse is terrific as 'Brutal' Howell, another guard and close friend of Edgecomb's. Morse perfectly personifies the character from the novel, and perfectly plays the role of the kind and sensitive man beneath a huge, tough exterior. Doug Hutchison is wonderfully despicable as Percy Wetmore, the spoiled brat of a prison guard, who no one can complain about, because of his political connections. So evil is Percy to all the helpless prisoners (who we care for a lot more than him) that we can't help but hate him, and feel truly satisfied when he is confined to a mental hospital at the end from being touched by Coffey, who referred to him as a 'bad man'. Sam Rockwell plays a wonderful psycho as 'Wild Bill' Wharton, going gleefully over the top, and still not seeming out of place. I was also very impressed by the performance of the late Michael Jeter as french prisoner Eduard Delacroix, he gave an excellent performance, and had exactly the same appearance and mannerisms as the character did in the novel. All around, highly impressive performances.The only noticeable flaw in The Green Mile is that with it's lengthy running time, the story seems a little slow paced at times, and too quickly paced at others. Arlen Bitterbuck, (played by Graham Greene) who was a significant character in the novel, is reduced to only once scene of dialogue, and two quick shots of him sitting in his cell in earlier scenes. The only possible reason I could find for shortening Bitterbuck's screen time so significantly would be to quicken the pace of the movie more, but since other parts drag, this intent doesn't exactly work. It's not a huge issue, but it's one that was bothering me as I watched the film. There's no doubt that The Green Mile is a highly impressive piece of work, or that it carries heavy emotional impact. An excellent storyline from the excellent Stephen King novel is updated into a truly excellent movie.

Needless to say... the movie is easily as good as the book, if not better, which is an occurrence that seems to happen less and less in movies these days. But with the Green Mile, director Frank Darabont and a superb cast have put together a truly touching and affecting story. Darabont, who also transferred the novel to a screenplay, is wise enough to know that Stephen King's original works are good enough without changing, and so he keeps virtually all spoken lines and events EXACTLY (and I'm not exaggerating) the same as in the novel, except for the odd time when he adds an extra line of dialogue or two to help clarify something the narrator originally said. This approach actually works out really well; it might have seemed patchy and awkward in a worst case scenario. Fortunately, the excellent cast is too experienced to let that happen. Tom Hanks, in one of his best performances yet, is wonderful as Paul Edgecomb, a prison guard on death row who comes across events he was by no means ready for. But it is safe to say that he is overshadowed (in more ways than one) by the simply wonderful performance given by Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, Edgecomb's prisoner who turns out to have 'special gifts'. It's a complex enough role as is, but Duncan brings so much more to Coffey than just crying and acting dim. Beneath Coffey's outward simple mindedness, (The name's John Coffey. Like the drink, 'cept not spelled the same.) there is a searing intelligence waiting just under the exterior, just enough for us to notice. Duncan really turns Coffey into a sympathetic character, and from the beginning, it is impossible to believe that Coffey was capable of raping and murdering two little girls - so much are we compelled to care about him. It is beyond me how Duncan could have lost out at the Oscars that year, one of the most potent examples, in my opinion, of how the Academy is more about politics than artistic merit.David Morse is terrific as 'Brutal' Howell, another guard and close friend of Edgecomb's. Morse perfectly personifies the character from the novel, and perfectly plays the role of the kind and sensitive man beneath a huge, tough exterior. Doug Hutchison is wonderfully despicable as Percy Wetmore, the spoiled brat of a prison guard, who no one can complain about, because of his political connections. So evil is Percy to all the helpless prisoners (who we care for a lot more than him) that we can't help but hate him, and feel truly satisfied when he is confined to a mental hospital at the end from being touched by Coffey, who referred to him as a 'bad man'. Sam Rockwell plays a wonderful psycho as 'Wild Bill' Wharton, going gleefully over the top, and still not seeming out of place. I was also very impressed by the performance of the late Michael Jeter as french prisoner Eduard Delacroix, he gave an excellent performance, and had exactly the same appearance and mannerisms as the character did in the novel. All around, highly impressive performances.The only noticeable flaw in The Green Mile is that with it's lengthy running time, the story seems a little slow paced at times, and too quickly paced at others. Arlen Bitterbuck, (played by Graham Greene) who was a significant character in the novel, is reduced to only once scene of dialogue, and two quick shots of him sitting in his cell in earlier scenes. The only possible reason I could find for shortening Bitterbuck's screen time so significantly would be to quicken the pace of the movie more, but since other parts drag, this intent doesn't exactly work. It's not a huge issue, but it's one that was bothering me as I watched the film. There's no doubt that The Green Mile is a highly impressive piece of work, or that it carries heavy emotional impact.

From an historical point of view, the movie treated Patton very favorably indeed, not surprising since the screenplay came largely from Ladislas Farrago's hagiography Patton, Ordeal & Triumph which almost deifies Patton - later histories and biographies are more honest, more accurate and reveal the seamier side of the Patton story including the fact that he was far from the gifted general that the movie would have one believe. Regretfully, Scott was unable to reprise his triumphal portrayal in Patton when he, unwisely, made The Last Days of Patton in 1986 - in some ways that disaster detracts from his original performance. Patton hasn't aged well. Thirty-five years down the track the use of the Spanish Army (and its equipment) as extras, poor continuity and patriotic hyperbole - which, no doubt, was stirring in 1970 when the US military was getting an ignoble beating in Vietnam - now grate, severely, on the viewer's nerves.

I got a kick out of the flying disc that captured General Zod (Terrance Stamp) and his cohorts to send them to their punishments, even though it looks really silly (as a kid, it really freaked me out). On the positive side for special effects, I must say that the film does a pretty convincing job with Superman's flying, especially for the time.But, special effects and aging aside, I was shocked at how utterly and completely boring the movie was. Booooooooooorrrring. The first 45 minutes, focusing on the destruction of Krypton, baby Kal's trip to Earth, Clark Kent as a teenager in Smallville (who doesn't look anything like the man he'll grow up to become), the death of Pa Kent, and Clark's time in the Fortress of Solitude were the most boring 45 minutes of a comic book movie I've ever seen. It literally put me to sleep. I couldn't believe how much it all sucked. To make things worse, scenes were added to this snooze-fest for the DVD release, making it all longer than the original.I'm assuming they spent so much time indulging in Superman's origin to A) make the movie feel more epic, and B) to get Marlon Brando (who plays Jor-El) more screen time. I hung in through this because I knew it got better. Then the Smallville stuff happened, which was beyond lame. You'd think the parts where Clark showed his powers would at least be cool, but it only made things worse. I've never seen a more gay run than the one teenage Clark exhibits when racing alongside a train. Seriously, he looked like a marionette (which, you will note, is a much gayer word than puppet).But, I persevered (after a night's sleep), and continued watching, knowing that the movie would get better once it headed to Metropolis. Of course, when the first third of a movie is terrible, it's already not a good movie. But, I had to see it through, if for no other reason that my home city, Calgary, doubles as Metropolis, and its always fun to see your own city on film (well, unless your own city is Los Angeles or New York, then its old hat). And you know what? The film did get better when it shifted to Metropolis, and the reason why can be summarised in two words Christopher Reeve.Christopher Reeve's portrayal of the bumbling Clark Kent, juxtaposed with the confident and heroic Superman, is spot-on. Perhaps the best portrayal of a comic book character ever. It's pretty fun the first time you see each side of Supes portrayed on screen, and Reeve manages to maintain his solid performance throughout. The problem is that almost everything that surrounds his performance sucks. Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is terrible, made even worse by his bumbling sidekick played by Ned Beatty. Margot Kidder is fine as Lois Lane, but nothing special. She has a nice scene when she meets Superman at her apartment, after he saved her life, but it's completely ruined by her god-AWFUL mental poetry while flying with Superman. Seriously, it sounded like it was written by a seven year old girl.Skip to the big exciting climax, which is one of my favourite bad movie moments of all-time. Lex Luthor is successful in detonating a nuclear missile along the San Andreas faultline, leading to an earthquake that should swallow up the entire west coast. Superman fights to stop it, but fails to prevent Lois Lane's death from being swallowed and crushed by the torn-apart Earth. Here's the best part mourning the loss of Lois, Supes does the only thing he can-- he flies around the Earth so fast that it reverses the rotation of the planet. Forget whether or not such a thing is even within Superman's capabilities, I'll allow that it is. What's awesome about this (and by awesome, I mean awesomely horrible) is that reversing the Earth's rotation causes time to move backward. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Why the screenwriters (amongst whom is The Godfather scribe Mario Puzo) thought this would lead to time travel, instead of say, causing everything on Earth that is not apart of the ground to fly off into space, is beyond me. And even if you do except the time travel, why on Earth would Superman not travel back in time long enough to prevent the nuclear bomb to go off? He only travels back far enough to prevent Lois' death, says hi to her, then leaves her and Jimmy Olson in the desert with a car with no gas (which makes you think that he thought her initial death was just too quick-- I guess he prefers starvation and dehydration). How did this even save Lois? Wouldn't the earthquake swallow her up again once Superman left? The movie then ends with Superman bringing Luthor and Beatty to prison, without ever showing how Superman captured them, because, really, who wants to see a guy defeat his archnemesis in action movies anyway? These things are best left to the imagination. I was shocked and dumb-founded at how overwhelmingly bad this movie was, absolutely terrible. I'd rather watch Batman & Robin. 2 stars out of 10, with Christopher Reeve being the only thing keeping this from getting a zero.

Story is about Dr. Bill Cortner (Jason Evers) who is with his girlfriend Jan Compton (Virginia Leith) and they are headed to his house in the country when they are involved in a car crash that decapitates Jan. Doctor Cortner brings her head to his laboratory where he has invented a serum that can connect lymphoid tissues and he keeps her head alive in a pan with electrodes and tubes that keep both blood and serum circulating but when she wakes up she wants to die!*****SPOILER ALERT*****Dr. Cortner is helped by his assistant Kurt (Leslie Daniels) who has a mangled and deformed arm (thanks to the good doctor!) and while he tends to things in the lab Dr. Cortner immediately heads to the local strip clubs in search of the perfect body for Jan's head. He runs into a sexy model named Doris (Adele Lamont) who has a bad scar on her face and he plans to lure her back to his lab and use her luscious body for the transplant. Meanwhile, Jan has been using telepathy to communicate with the hideous mutant (yep, thanks to the good doctor again!) that's locked in the closet and she manages to get him (or it) to grab Kurt and rip off his good arm.This was directed by Joseph Green who only made one more film after this and I guess it's hard to keep a directing career going when your the one responsible for this. This is very low budget and it looks as if most of it was shot and filmed in someone's basement which would account for the echo that is heard in certain scenes. I did manage to notice little things that I found interesting like in the beginning of the film Evers is smoking in the ER after performing an operation! Isn't that a tad unsanitary? Also, the country house that Dr. Cortner owns is gigantic and resembles an English castle! It must be nice to be a well paid doctor. I found it very amusing that Dr. Cortner wasn't going to be satisfied with any female body for Jan and didn't waste any time heading to strip joints and cajoling with sexy models. The guy was definitely horny! The film manages to get two strippers to start fighting and wrestle to the ground and as this takes place the camera zooms up to the pictures of cats on the wall...Meow!!! This does manage to do two things that are still quite effective and the first is the gore in the scene where Kurt has his arm ripped off.

The second thing is the casting of Eddie Carmel as the mutant which is still pretty gruesome to watch and I can perfectly understand a young kid being effected by his 7 foot stature and the make-up that's applied on him isn't that bad either. This does have it's share of unintended laughs (the tape over Jan's mouth!) but I found this to be an entertaining exploitation horror flick from the early sixties when these types of films were just a few years away from being really graphic and it's something that all lovers of cult (and camp) should definitely view.
