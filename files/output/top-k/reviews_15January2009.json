He gave us such films like Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space. Such great classics and other all rightfully gave him the tittle of the world's worst dirctor of all time. He was not only the worst but also the weirdest. He even makes director Tim Burton, the master mind behind this film, look rather sane. With his bizarre cross-dressing life style and collection of odd friends one could easily mistake him as a fictional character made by Burton him self. But no! Ed Wood really did make some of the most painfully bad movies of all time and haunted movie goers through out his life.Unlike Ed woods Films this movie is actually really good. I think it's my favorite Burton film. Once again Tim Burton cast his good friend Jonny Depp as the lead. Depp performance as Ed wood is really entertaining. In spite of the fact Wood is screwed up in the head, has no talent and is destined to fail one cant help but find him self liking this weirdo. Depp is not the only the great performance in this movie. Martin Landua dose a really great job as the has been Bela Lougsi. For those of you not familiar with Lougsi he only played Dracula and his performance has made him a horror icon to this day. However in this film we see him after his fame has ran its course. Now he is a grumpy drug addicted has been in his old age that no one will heir. No one but his number one fan Ed Wood. Bill Murry plays one of Ed's most bizarre friends. An overly depressed man who keeps moping about how much he wants to become a Women. Sara Jessica Parker also appears as Ed Woods's girl friend who he is keeping in the dark about his wardrobe. Not my favorit actress but it worked out. So we have an interesting cast of people playing a very strange cast of characters.The first thing to be noted about the film is that it is filmed completely in black and white. In fact the film is made to look similar to what Ed Woods's movies were like. The only difference is that this one is decent. So we are not just seeing a retelling of Woods life, we are also seeing how he may have seen the world and the people in it. So thought out the movie we get a few moments that are much like the things you find in Ed's films but its place in just right. The movie is quite humors to. The things Wood would do to get his horrible film together, the dialogue and Woods film making had me chuckling. There is also some emotion found in the film, most notably in Woods friendship With Bela. This on screen drama earn actor Martin Landua an Oscar for his performance. To bad the real Ed Wood never got one of these. His movie probably could not earn a razy award in any age.Tim Burton's odd Gothic style of filming some how works really well in the retelling of the life of such an odd man. Pluse he catchs that feeling of b-rated 50 scifi movies. After watching this I can safely say this is his most underrated movie. The only real thing that bothers me about this movie was when it neared the end. It's not much but I was hopping we could of seen a little more of what happen after the release of the last movie.

Gods and Monsters has little to do with the process of making films, but it does contain an interesting look at one of cinema's most memorable contributors. Though it is flawed, it is nonetheless interesting.There's really not much story. James Whale (Ian McKellan) is a retired film director, living out the rest of his days in peace and solitude with his housekeeper, Hanna (a delightful Lynn Redgrave). Enter a new gardener named Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser), and the homosexual Whale is immediately interested (You have the most architectural skull...). Thus begins an examination of the tortured James Whale, which we get mostly through his interaction with Clayton.Most film goers know Ian McKellan as Gandalf the Grey. While that may have been the role that made him famous to mainstream viewers, his portrayal of James Whale is his best performance. Everything from his mannerisms to the randomly vacant expression, it works. Lynn Redgrave is delightful as his housekeeper, but Redgrave seeks to develop a character instead of someone who is on hand for comic relief.Brendan Fraser may be known as the guy heading The Mummy franchise (the modern one, not the original), but every now and then he takes a role like this to remind us he's an actor, not someone who can just run and shoot mummies all day. Clayton Boone may seem like a dumb jock at first, but there's more to him than meets the eye. He develops a friendship with Whale (it's clear he's not gay), and Fraser and McKellan have great chemistry together.I like Bill Condon's work. He adds a richness to the characters and the story that is totally his own. Most significantly, however, is how he addresses weighty topics with a lighter tone, while still respecting the material. His first major effort behind the camera is not as successful as his later film, Kinsey, in this respect. Condon doesn't allow any connection between the cast and the audience, and that limits the involvement of the audience, thus robbing it of much of its power. Still, he wrote a strong script that allows the actors to create unique, three-dimensional individuals, even though we don't exactly feel it.There are some major flaws with Gods and Monsters, but overall, I liked it. The whole doesn't live up to the sum of its parts, but the pieces of it are strong in and of themselves.

I recently re watched TCM 2 on DVD and, in possession of many elements of comparison between the 2 films, I am not afraid to put it on an equal level of quality next to its predecessor for the followings 1) It is a motivated and consistent sequel  the murderous and cannibalistic family is still on the loose. An atrocious series of crimes remained unpunished, which justifies the part of Dennis Hopper, uncle of the Hardestys. 2) The way he accomplishes his vengeance brings laugh, the lone and mystic ranger way, like an angel of retribution with God and saws on his side. The change of tonality was severely criticized but let's face it, had Tobe Hooper filmed the same first-degree tale of horror, fans would have been much harsher. This mixture of western and horror makes it an original and entertaining sequel. So please don't crucify the creator too much ! 3) As in the first one, analysis can be added to pleasure. No matter what savagery the Sawyers commit, they are still victims of recession, unemployment and automation, not just plain psycho-killers. The introduction of Chop Top, Viet Nam veteran brother to Leatherface, constitutes a real point of interest  the superimposition of one tale of historic horror to another one in film. This, in my opinion, refutes any accusation of trivialized violence.

An atrocious series of crimes remained unpunished, which justifies the part of Dennis Hopper, uncle of the Hardestys. 2) The way he accomplishes his vengeance brings laugh, the lone and mystic ranger way, like an angel of retribution with God and saws on his side. The change of tonality was severely criticized but let's face it, had Tobe Hooper filmed the same first-degree tale of horror, fans would have been much harsher. This mixture of western and horror makes it an original and entertaining sequel. So please don't crucify the creator too much ! 3) As in the first one, analysis can be added to pleasure. No matter what savagery the Sawyers commit, they are still victims of recession, unemployment and automation, not just plain psycho-killers. The introduction of Chop Top, Viet Nam veteran brother to Leatherface, constitutes a real point of interest  the superimposition of one tale of historic horror to another one in film. This, in my opinion, refutes any accusation of trivialized violence. Last but not least, the impossible romance of Leatherface simulating a penetration with his saw rather turns him more into a pathetic than crude individual. We would almost sympathize. 4) Some touches of macabre and amoral humor are really enjoyable  the chili contest won by a certain Sawyer. Would we realize it if we were fed human flesh ? Would we savor it if we were told it was a secret of longevity (cf 137 years old Granpa Sawyer) ? This disturbs and amuses at the same time the horror fan that I am. As a conclusion, in spite of its commercial failure of the time, this film deserves reconsideration in memory of an age long forgotten, when horror films were not all merely franchises targeted to sex freak teenagers. Ever since what has followed TCM 2, there has not been a single ounce of creativity or interest, apart from a few gore novelties and demonstrations of free sadism  TCM 3 is not about the same family, TCM 4 is just terrible, the 2003 remake and its prequel do not mention cannibalism and clumsily try to tell the youth of Leatherface without any explanation about how he came to be what he is, pointless. TCM and TCM 2 form an efficient diptych to spike a night of boredom or weary tranquility. If you have not seen the others yet, don't waste your time trying !

I didn't love Coeurs, but thought it was technically impressive and admired most of all Resnais' mise-en-scene, and it thankfully made me interested in seeing more Resnais films. On the other hand, Mystery Train, which coincidentally also has interconnecting stories, was a real disappointment. I'll say this right now I didn't 'get' this movie, I don't understand why it's acclaimed, and it didn't exactly make me want to see more Jarmusch films, especially as he is supposedly an auteur, suggesting that his writing for other films, or at least most of his other films, would be similar to this.I didn't think this film was impressive at all on any technical scale. It's not 'simple' or 'understated', it's borderline simplistic, or at least seemed so to me. Jarmusch's approach to the film is thoroughly conventional and expected in every scene, there was nothing interesting about the mise-en-scene, nothing special about his approach whatsoever. Moreover, it's not even an especially well-shot film by normal Hollywood standards, just 'solid'. My real problem with the film however was the writing. I found it to be truly poor for much of the film. The opening segment with the Japanese couple is the epitome of pretentious quirk, something which is only emphasized by the lead actor's awful stare-and-pause-between-words approach, which I'd also blame on Jarmusch. I don't even think there should be a 'point' to things necessarily, but I've rarely seen anything so self-congratulatory and for what? Wow, you wrote a silly story about Japanese caricatures in Memphis filled with borderline racist jokes which have been used in movies for decades! Whoop-de-doo! The second story is better, but still undeserving of the film's reputation. An Italian tourist in Memphis is tricked into buying a stack of magazines, a con-man attempts to cheat her out of 20 bucks with an Elvis ghost story, then she ends up at the hotel which connects the three stories, shares a room with an annoying American, and sees Elvis' ghost. At least it's entertaining. The third story should've been better, but again, the caricatures get progressively more annoying and the quirky, self-congratulatory, 'clever' humor is just unbearable. This isn't far removed from the sort of 'indie comedy' which is ruining the movies for anyone with a sense of humor, and it has made further adventures in Jarmusch-land a worrying prospect. Ugh. I'm pretty sure this movie's reputation is almost entirely built on it being 'cool' due to the soundtrack, Screamin' Jay Hawkins (who IS cool), etc, but you know what? The billionth time that Japanese idiot mentioned Carl Perkins I wished I was listening to Carl Perkins. If this is the work of a great director... Godard did make King Lear, that gives me some hope.

It was fun, fast, and fantastic. Explosions, lasers, spaceships, what else could a kid ask for? Then I grew up. I watched the movie again when I was seventeen, and all I could do was gape in horror. I could have sworn I saw a different movie as a child, but going back through it, I couldn't believe that I had liked it so much. It really reminds me as to how my tastes have changed and how what I look for in a movie has changed. As an addition to the Star Wars saga, I didn't begrudge it at the time simply because it was, well, another chapter in the Star Wars saga. I loved watching one of my favorite film franchises play out on the big screen. But frankly, in retrospect, I think (right now at 20 years old) it should have been avoided entirely.Where to start? The writing of this story was abysmal. The writers were looking for some sort of main bad guy, so they concocted the Trade Federation, a corporate conglomerate of evil. A good idea in principle, but terrible in execution. Instead of being composed of a variety of aliens, humans, etc. it's composed of a single type of alien who seem so stereotypically modeled after the greedy Asian model that it would make the person who designed the pathetic Klingon stereotype for Star Trek The Original Series cringe. The fact that they all had thick Japanese accents didn't really help. So point one was that Lucas apparently didn't know how to write a good story without including some bad stereotypes.The second point was the introduction of the Jedi. Liam Neeson's role as Qui-Gon Jinn was perhaps the high point of the film, since he's already known for his acting prowess; in fact, it's hard to find talent like his. The problem is that everything Liam Neeson brings to the screen is offset by the horrible dialogue scripted by Lucas. As Yoda would perhaps say, stilted one-liners and poorly written expository statements a Jedi does not make. Ewan MacGregor didn't bring much to the role either, although I will admit, his character is far more in keeping with his elderly Alec Guinness counterpart.The third and worst clincher is, of course, Jar Jar Binks. This godawful Caribbean-stereotyped character whose sole purpose is to fall on his face and annoy the characters at every turn seems to try the patience of every person who is sitting in the theater. He not only is unfunny, but all of his scripted lines consist of making stupid noises and funny (not) faces. The reason people connected with Chewbacca even though his entirety of dialogue was in growling was due to his interaction with Han Solo. Jar Jar Binks' interaction with the other characters makes people want to slice his head off.And last but not least, Anakin Skywalker. Seriously. What kind of whiny runt of a kid grows up to become a Dark Lord of the Sith? Granted, the actor was something like 13 years old, but his acting was atrocious. Lucas decided to conceive him as some sort of virgin birth in order to give him some sort of mystical quality and that quickly backfired when we find out that he complains ALL THE TIME. He also manages to end up being the hero because he randomly shot off a couple of torpedoes... what? The reason Luke was able to fire off torpedoes and destroy the Death Star was because of his attunement to the Force. Anakin just fired like a blind idiot. Out of character and out of whack.I can't give this film a lower rating than it already has because, frankly, it's got better writing than the other two prequel trilogy films, which just shows you the abysmal depths to which Lucas has sunk the franchise.

Which that film fooled many audiences and film critics thinking it was an true-life documentary. Which the town of Burkittsville, Maryland is filled with die-hard fans of the movie. Which the town's people are not happy about it. Now five die-hard fans of the movieKim (Kim Director), Jeffery (Jeffery Donovan), Erica (Erica Leerhsen), Tristine (Tristine Skyler) and Stephen (Stephen Baker Turner) are visiting the woods. Where the original film is set-up but after an night of partying and drinking too-heavily. The five strangers found their stuff destroyed and having no real memory of what they done that night. Slowly these five people find themselves seeing visions or ghostly presence that haunts them and there's nothing what it seems from these people or the things they experienced.Directed by documentary filmmakerJoe Berlinger (MetallicaSome Kind of Monster, Paradise Lost) made an interesting although flawed and not very scary loose sequel of The Blair Witch Project. Berlinger isn't very happy how Artisan (now Lions Gate Films) re-cut his version, which could have been much better. Which the Director explained in the entertaining audio commentary track. Die-Hard fans of the original were truly disappointed that The Blair Witch Project was only an movie and this one takes an different style of modern film-making. Book of ShadowsBlair Witch 2 did make an small profit at the box office, it is probably completely forgotten now but the movie does have an small loyal of fans. Which some people will say Book of ShadowsBlair Witch 2 is a minor cult film.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.851) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an filmmaker commentary track, an selected scene commentary by music composerCarter Burwell (Psycho 3, In Bruges, No Country for Old Men) and more. DVD also has CD Side with an few songs from the film and the entire soundtrack from the movie. Director Berlinger did really try to make this an scary movie with an few jabs at satire but it doesn't always work. The cast do give their 110 % (especially Donovan is terrific) but only Larry Flaherty as Sheriff Cravens gives an laughable amateurish performance that hurts the movie, when he is on-screen. Otherwise... that's one of the few minor flaws of Book of ShadowsBlair Witch 2. I doubt, we will see Berlinger's true director's cut one day but it is certainly an underrated film with some occasional cleverness. Worth a look. (****\/*****).

So much of the novel had been left out and I considered William Hurt to be terribly miscast as Rochester. Since then I have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel, the three short versions of '44, '70 and '97 and the three mini series of '73, '83 and 2006, and I have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse Rochesters.This is without doubt the most exquisite Jane Eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned. Director Franco Zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky, of lonely Rochester standing on a rock, and of Jane looking out of the window - but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life. In addition, his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes. As a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between Jane and Rochester, and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse. There are a number of short conversations between Rochester and Jane, each of them beautifully staged, but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other. We know that they are supposed to fall in love, but we never see it actually happen. The scene in which Rochester wants to find out Jane's reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded Mason has left the house is completely missing, and the farewell scene, the most important scene - the climax - of the novel is reduced to four sentences. Zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for Brontë's superb lines, neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten, but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out. What remains is just a glimpse of the novel, which does no justice to Charlotte Brontë's masterpiece.The cast is a mixed bag While Fiona Shaw is an excellent Mrs Reed, Anna Paquin's young Jane is more an ill-mannered, pout Lolita than a lonely little girl, longing for love. The ever-reliable Joan Plowright makes a very likable, but far too shrewd Mrs Fairfaix, and one cannot help feeling that Billie Whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain-looking, hard-working Grace Poole. Charlotte Gainsbourgh as the grown-up heroine, however, is physically a perfect choice for playing Jane Eyre. Looking every bit like 18, thin and frail, with irregular, strong features, she comes closest to my inner vision of Jane than any other actress in that role. And during the first 15 minutes of her screen time I was enchanted by her performance. Gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask. But unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of Jane's character any further. As a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues, Gainsbourgh's portrayal of Jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory. This is a pity, as with a better script Charlotte Gainsbourgh might have been as good a Jane as Zelah Clarke in the '83 version.But while it is still obvious that Gainsbourgh is trying to play Jane, there is no trace whatsoever of Rochester in the character that William Hurt portrays. Hurt, who has proved himself to be a fine actor in many good movies, must have been aware that he was physically and type-wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the Rochester of the novel. His Rochester, besides being blond and blue-eyed, is a soft-spoken, well-mannered nobleman, shy and quiet, slightly queer and eccentric, but basically good-natured and mild. He is so far from being irascible, moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous. Additionally, during many moments of the movie, Hurt's facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness. Particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open. If you compare his Rochester to the strong-willed and charming protagonist of the novel, simply bursting with energy and temperament, it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in Hurt's performance. Still, he offends me less than the Rochesters in the '70, '97 and 2006 versions and I would in general rank this Jane Eyre higher than these three other ones. Hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the Rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so, whereas George C. Scott, Ciaràn Hinds and Toby Stephens thought they could, but failed miserably, and I'd rather watch a character other than Rochester than a Rochester who is badly played. And I'd rather watch a Jane Eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a today's couple in a Starbucks café. Of course this Jane Eyre is a failure, but at least it is an inoffensive one, which is more than one can say of the '97 and 2006 adaptations. I would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation You will not find Jane Eyre, but at least you will find a beautifully made movie.

His Rochester, besides being blond and blue-eyed, is a soft-spoken, well-mannered nobleman, shy and quiet, slightly queer and eccentric, but basically good-natured and mild. He is so far from being irascible, moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous. Additionally, during many moments of the movie, Hurt's facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness. Particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open. If you compare his Rochester to the strong-willed and charming protagonist of the novel, simply bursting with energy and temperament, it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in Hurt's performance. Still, he offends me less than the Rochesters in the '70, '97 and 2006 versions and I would in general rank this Jane Eyre higher than these three other ones. Hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the Rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so, whereas George C. Scott, Ciaràn Hinds and Toby Stephens thought they could, but failed miserably, and I'd rather watch a character other than Rochester than a Rochester who is badly played. And I'd rather watch a Jane Eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a today's couple in a Starbucks café. Of course this Jane Eyre is a failure, but at least it is an inoffensive one, which is more than one can say of the '97 and 2006 adaptations. I would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation You will not find Jane Eyre, but at least you will find a beautifully made movie.

So much of the novel had been left out and I considered William Hurt to be terribly miscast as Rochester. Since then I have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel, the three short versions of '44, '70 and '97 and the three mini series of '73, '83 and 2006, and I have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse Rochesters.This is without doubt the most exquisite Jane Eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned. Director Franco Zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky, of lonely Rochester standing on a rock, and of Jane looking out of the window - but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life. In addition, his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes. As a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between Jane and Rochester, and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse. There are a number of short conversations between Rochester and Jane, each of them beautifully staged, but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other. We know that they are supposed to fall in love, but we never see it actually happen. The scene in which Rochester wants to find out Jane's reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded Mason has left the house is completely missing, and the farewell scene, the most important scene - the climax - of the novel is reduced to four sentences. Zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for Brontë's superb lines, neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten, but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out. What remains is just a glimpse of the novel, which does no justice to Charlotte Brontë's masterpiece.The cast is a mixed bag While Fiona Shaw is an excellent Mrs Reed, Anna Paquin's young Jane is more an ill-mannered, pout Lolita than a lonely little girl, longing for love. The ever-reliable Joan Plowright makes a very likable, but far too shrewd Mrs Fairfaix, and one cannot help feeling that Billie Whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain-looking, hard-working Grace Poole. Charlotte Gainsbourgh as the grown-up heroine, however, is physically a perfect choice for playing Jane Eyre. Looking every bit like 18, thin and frail, with irregular, strong features, she comes closest to my inner vision of Jane than any other actress in that role. And during the first 15 minutes of her screen time I was enchanted by her performance. Gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask. But unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of Jane's character any further. As a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues, Gainsbourgh's portrayal of Jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory. This is a pity, as with a better script Charlotte Gainsbourgh might have been as good a Jane as Zelah Clarke in the '83 version.But while it is still obvious that Gainsbourgh is trying to play Jane, there is no trace whatsoever of Rochester in the character that William Hurt portrays.

In 1962 Kirk Douglas made his one and only return to Broadway to star as Randall P. McMurphy on stage with Joan Tetzel as his nemesis, nurse Ratched. Douglas bought the screen rights, but by the time anyone was interested in doing the film version, Kirk was too old for the part.That may have been a break for the movie fans because as much as I like Kirk Douglas, I can't see anyone but Jack Nicholson doing this role as the free spirited McMurphy. McMurphy's a low level career criminal type who statutorily raped a girl as he put it '15 going on 35'. He decides to fake a crazy act while in prison to get out of the work farm he's assigned to.So Nicholson's goes to the mental hospital where he meets an odd assortment of people whom he discovers voluntarily checked themselves in there, mainly because it's easier to stay there and not take all your psychological baggage into society. That's a crucial difference that Nicholson finds out the hard way, his new friends most of them can pack up and leave anytime they want. He's sent there by the state and the state determines when he's ready to go even if it's past the allotted jail time he was sentenced to.The state in this case is Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, one of the great Dickensian names ever given a movie character. Louise is the ultimate control freak and these people who've shut themselves away from life are her ultimate tools. When Nicholson comes in, he hasn't given up on life like the rest of these poor souls, he becomes a threat to Fletcher's little empire.It's hard to believe that such a smart guy like McMurphy would not have known the rules about commitment. Still it doesn't detract a bit from the overall quality of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.Though the topic is not a fixed one to any era, the script does leave many oblique references to the Sixties in the film. The electroshock treatment and the lobotomy operations depicted here were by 1975 no longer in use. They were pretty barbaric and the mental health profession discarded these, but not before too many lives were shattered with them. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest swept the main Oscar categories, it won for Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman, Best Actor for Jack Nicholson, Best Actress for Louise Fletcher and Best Adapted Screenplay to Lawrence Hauban and Bo Goldman. Brad Dourif was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but he lost to George Burns in The Sunshine Boys.Louise Fletcher never got the career mileage she should have for playing Nurse Ratched.

There are lots of silly plot twists and lines, but the whole thing has the look of an in-joke--one that the film makers thought was absolutely hilarious but only some audience members will enjoy. I can almost guarantee that you'll either love it or dislike it. I could tolerate it but felt that the comedy just too often fell flat.

I like his earlier movies where he was simply funny and not trying to figure out the meaning of life or display the ennui of rich Manhattanites. I find those films incredibly ponderous and self-indulgent. But stuff like 'Play it Again Sam' (even though it has the equally whiny Diane Keaton), or 'Take the Money and Run' were his best films.This film is a return to simple funny. One thing that happened while watching this movie about 20 minutes into the movie I felt something about this movie was strange, but I couldn't figure out what. Then it hit me no swearing. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie directed at adults that didn't have swearing. I'm not against swearing in movies by any means, but I have to say, I found it really refreshing. The script was forced to find the funny for real, rather on shock value. Needless to say, it also thankfully doesn't have any of the gross-out humour that passes for comedy in most films these days either. In the hands of most writers, it's not about pushing boundaries, but simply revealing the lack of genuine talent.Although Ullman does a very good job, and Allen is at his comedic best, Elaine May really shines through in her role and is the one that makes me smile the most. It's a shame that she doesn't get, or take, more roles.

Sadly, I was disappointed, as this film is awful.I know it is an old film but, even making allowances for that, the special effects look truly awful. The back of the video claimed that it was shot on-location, this was obviously untrue; White borders are visible around some of the characters and the backgrounds look like they were painted on canvas.It's not just the special affects, either, the majority of the story is told for narration. The acting is nonexistent because the narrator frequently reports character speech in third person rather than the actors speaking. This is a film, so why do we need a running audio description of what's being shown on this screen? In summary If you want to listen to a reading of The Old Man and The Sea with some pretty pictures to look at then this is the film for you. Otherwise, just read the book.

It was a long time since I saw a such a good movie. First when I heard about this movie I thought that is another 'gangsta movie' with a boring story, a gang war or something like that, in the first 15 or 20 minutes I was a bit disappointed but after this I've realized that is a great movie. I thought at this movie o hole day after I saw it,is so close to reality, it is like a reality show or a flagrant made by police with a hidden camera, i never thought a movie like this is possible,makes us think at the life we livin', at the society as it is, naked, without any clothes on it. The movie has a few errors, but at a movie with such a story does not matter a few issues, practically the story and the mode the movie is made repairs the issues keeping you close to screen that you can't see them. Denzel Washington plays awesome, I haven't seen somebody playing so good in this kind if role since Al Pacino in Scarface, I'm sure that if a person that doesn't know Denzel Washington as an actor, watches how he plays, that person will probably tel you that is a men taken from the streets, not an actor. Ethan Hawke plays great to, he was probably deserving an Oscar at the time but perhaps it was just bad luck.It's an excellent movie with a great story that is waiting for entering Top 250, if you wanna see an exceptional movie you should watch this, I can't find my words to describe it so I probably have to end my comment here.
