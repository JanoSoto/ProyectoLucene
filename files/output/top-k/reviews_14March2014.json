The astronaut soon leads the humans to revolt.I don't think there's any question that Tim Burton really knows how to make a film look great. And so it is with this remake of Planet of the Apes. The locations, sets, ape make-up, costumes, cast, score (Danny Elfman) and direction are all outstanding. Just as good as the original film and, in many cases, even better. Unfortunately, the overall results are a mixed bag.WHAT DOESN'T WORK The biggest problem with this remake is that there is no build-up of mystery. Wahlberg crashlands to the planet very early on in the story, just like in the original film. Unfortunately, as soon as he lands he's IMMEDIATELY thrust into the ape\/human conflict, captured and taken to the ape city. This flashes by so quickly that the viewer could easily MISS IT ALL if s\/he got up for a few minutes to get something from the kitchen!! The original took its time in this matter; Taylor (Heston) and his fellow astronauts obviously crashland in the middle of nowhere and explore the planet for a long period of time before eventually encountering the inhabitants of the planet. It's all very mysterious, and there's a lot of build-up to the ape revelation.It's also highly unbelievable that Wahlberg would crashland right into the midst of the human\/ape conflict. The planet is the size of Earth, so what are the chances that he'd land right in the middle of the fray? I suppose Burton and the writers didn't want the film to bog down once Wahlberg crashlands, but couldn't they have at least given us FIVE MINUTES of exploration time, giving the impression that Wahlberg searches for a fairly long period of time before encountering the humans and apes? As it's presented it's simply too unbelievable.This is a major misstep; and because it happens so early in the film it strongly tempts most intelligent viewers (who naturally MUST have some reasonable amount of believability to enjoy sci-fi) to lose faith in the picture and tune out or, at least, become excessively critical of the remainder of the film.Another problem with the picture is that I just simply failed to really get caught up in the characters and their story. There needed to be more character-defining dialogue. A well written script causes the viewer to be CAPTIVATED by the storyline. Well, I never fully got captivated.These factors explain why I was severely let down when first viewing the film at the theater in 2001.WHAT WORKS Seeing the film again recently, I was braced for these flaws and willing to suspend disbelief to (try to) enjoy the story. I now conclude that there are numerous worthwhile qualities to the remake.For one thing, although Mark Wahlberg is no Charleton Heston (Taylor was Heston's greatest role and performance IMHO), I think he does a great job as the protagonist. Helena Bonham Carter is also fabulous in the Zira-like role of Ari; she really brings Ari to life and makes her unique. And as beautiful as Linda Harrison was as Nova, Estella Warren pretty much blows her out of the water in the counterpart role of Daena. Unfortunately her character is shallow and we never get a satisfyingly good look at Estelle in all her voluptuous glory. But, no matter, what we DO see is breathtaking.Tim Roth is utterly evil as the villainous Thade. This is very much in contrast to Dr. Zaius in the original, who was actually a very noble character. Lastly, the giant Michael Clarke Duncan is magnificent as the gorilla general, Thade's friend.As to be expected, the ape make-up is WAY better than the original, even though I still love the job they did in the earlier film. The ape characters don't only look more like highly evolved apes compared to the original, they walk, talk, howl, grunt, jump, fight and climb more like real apes.The ape city sets are fabulous too, albeit a bit too dark for my tastes. I find this unbelievable and verging on cartooney. I know Burton is into Goth and therefore prefers dark lighting, but it would be nice to actually SEE the wonderful sets made for the film (or perhaps he doesn't want the viewer to get too good a look and see how artificial they really are? I don't know, I'm just guessing).I also liked all the homages to the original film -- the various lines, Linda Harrison, Charleton Heston as Thade's dying father, etc.Although numerous people had a problem with the ending, I think they did a good job. How else better to end it? Notice how the camera mysteriously shoots from behind the Lincoln Memorial just like the original does with the Statue of Liberty.FINAL ANALYSIS Despite a couple major flaws there's a lot to appreciate in Burton's remake. It's not as good as the original or Beneath, but it's, at least, on a par with Escape. And it's certainly better than Conquest and, especially, Battle.The bottom line is that Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes is a worthwhile addition to your apes film collection.

Next in that line up was this action film. It's also probably the last time Dolph Lundgren ever played a Russian character. Good thing too because being typecast as a certain character frequently doesn't give the viewer something more to look forward too. Here, he plays a devoted Russian soldier who is trained and highly skilled in the art of killing. But as the story continues, he realizes maybe he's not seeing the whole picture.With a screenplay written by first timer Arne Olsen, it isn't great nor is it terrible. The story does contain some meaningful moments, but most of them are frequently overshadowed by scenes that are predictable enough that regular viewers could see it coming a mile away. There are also some points in the film that would make the viewer question How does this pertain to the development of the character?. It can be far fetched at times. Like how is learning the way of a hunter open one's eyes to reality? Is it really that powerful of a activity?That's not to say the actors perform badly though. Dolph Lundgren portraying a Russian is accurate. He's a blonde, large, hulking mass of muscle and can speak with the basic accent.

My question is though, how did an American reporter get caught in the middle of this? Lastly, Brion James makes an appearance too, who would play the British character, Requin in Tango & Cash (1989) a year later. It's an alright cast for this movie.However, the way the action is executed reminds me of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Commando (1985). There's lots of explosions and plenty of shootings.

But perhaps what helped this movie to excel further than Commando (1985) was the human aspect of it. Al White's character leads a bunch of poor followers who seek freedom from the Russian oppression. And when the audience sees them fall, it's hard to watch. Assisting those particular segments was Jay Chattaway's music to the film. In some places it worked but the rest didn't.

Fernandes was able to get nice shots of the arid terrain, which at least allows the audience to believe the place Lundgren was set in wasn't forgiving. In the end, it's not great or terrible. It's just average film making.As Dolph Lundgren's last film to play a Russian character, it comes off as a better rip-off of Commando (1985) but doesn't take the story in any direction that hasn't been explored.

Joseph Zito, the man behind Chuck Norris' Missing in Action (1984), Friday the 13th The Final Chapter (1984) and The Prowler (1981) knew what he was doing. Also accompanying him is cinematographer João Fernandes who has also worked with Zito in the past. Fernandes was able to get nice shots of the arid terrain, which at least allows the audience to believe the place Lundgren was set in wasn't forgiving. In the end, it's not great or terrible. It's just average film making.As Dolph Lundgren's last film to play a Russian character, it comes off as a better rip-off of Commando (1985) but doesn't take the story in any direction that hasn't been explored. Just average on the whole.

When I was at Antietam one of the eye-witness quotes was Bodies filled the entire field with every imaginable wound. I was so overwhelmed tears flowed from my eyes.Why do I bring all this up? I just want you to know how INTO the Civil War I was (and still am, to a lesser degree), not just on an intellectual level, but an emotional one as well.So in December 1993 my then-fiancé and I went to the theater to see the over-four-hour-long Gettysburg with much interest. All I can say is it was VERY DIFFICULT to sit through this entire film in one sitting.Gettysburg has a lot going for it an all-star cast, including Tom Berenger (Longstreat), Martin Sheen (Robert E. Lee), Jeff Daniels (Chamberlain) and Sam Elliott (Buford); great authentic Gettysburg locations; good battle scenes; a commitment to historical accuracy; and thousands upon thousands of Civil War reenactors.The subjects of the Civil War and Gettysburg are immensely interesting. You would think, therefore, that Gettysburg would be overflowing with life, but that's hardly the case. It takes FOREVER for things to get going. Plus there's an undeniably lazy and unexciting feel to the settings and dialogue when the forces aren't actually fighting. One has to REALLY CONCENTRATE to listen to and get through the interminable dialogue. Plus the mawkish melodrama factor is high.Part I is highlighted by Chamberlain's defense of Little Round Top and his mad bayonet charge while Part II ends with the South's infamous Pickett's Charge. Both of these sequences are great and they give the viewer a good feel of what it must have really been like, which is one of the reasons I enjoy seeing historical films.The score is only half good. You'll definitely hear spots of brilliance but way too often it's sickeningly ultra-heroic or melodramatic.One aspect I liked was seeing the officers and soldiers pray while standing in line right before significant engagements. Yeah, it's hard to be an atheist when you're about to walk straight into friggin' cannon fire.BOTTOM LINE There's a lot to respect about Gettysburg. It's a story about war and the men who engage in it, pure and simple. There's no female cast members, no forced romances. Unfortunately it's bloated, melodramatic and just plain lazy. Trust me, the REAL Gettysburg battle was anything BUT lazy and uninteresting. Still, if I concentrate hard to pay attention to the dialogue and non-action events in the film, I get a lot out of it. In other words, if you're braced for its shortcomings it's worth owning or renting. I'm glad I own it. But don't expect something great like, say, Glory. The battle of Gettysburg took place July 1-3, 1863 and was a huge victory for the North, the turning point of the war, in fact (along with Grant's simultaneous siege of Vicksburg). After the failure of Pickett's Charge, General Lee and his troops retreated back to their own territory. The war would go on for another two long years (almost) as the Confederates continued to put up an incredible and courageous fight, but the odds were against them. Gettysburg and Vicksburg were the seeds of their impending doom.General Meade congratulated his men for driving the Confederate invaders from the North's turf. But President Lincoln was upset because he wanted Meade to DESTROY Lee's army, not allow them to safely retreat back to their Southern sanctuary. Lincoln groaned  'Drive the invader from our soil'? My God! is that all? Four months after the battle of Gettysburg, on November 19th, Lincoln came to the small town and gave his potent 'Gettysburg Address' to honor the fallen soldiers and motivate continued Northern commitment and victory.

I can't say I have watched many films that have done that. At first, I was reluctant to watch the film because I find most black and white films to be slow paced and quite boring. I know, unpopular opinion, but I am a mere sixteen year old boy and have grew up with all the newer stuff. But I digress, I watched the film because I came across the train station scene by accident on YouTube, which may have spoilt it a bit but it left me shattered and I knew that I had to watch the entire film. Knowing it was in fact a 1980 film, I assured myself that it wouldn't be like the black and white films I have watched. I was beyond correct.I thought I'd feel sorry for John Merrick (John Hurt) and have a respect for him, but it was more than that. I found myself connected to John Merrick and to Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins). The characters were not only wonderfully wrote, but were also wonderfully acted. I was literally clenching my fist when the mob attacked Merrick wrecked his room. And that single tear running down Treves' cheek at the beginning of the film when he first saw Merrick was just so heartbreakingly perfect; you can see his feelings towards this new discovery without him saying anything at all.Before watching the film, I found out that most of the film is in fact fictional, and that the name of the character was changed from Joseph Merrick to John Merrick (possibly due to it being in Treves' diary). This originally put me off slightly as I expected The Elephant Man to get everything wrong and send the wrong message. But I came to learn that that didn't matter at all. If this film were entirely fictional, it'd still be absolutely brilliant.Every scene of The Elephant Man was essential, I believe. We slowly began to love and feel happy for Merrick, before he's chucked back into chaos and we're thrown into a state of both sadness and anger for the character we had grown to love and care about. The entire thing came together perfectly, thanks to the writers, Christopher De Vore, Eric Bergren and the great David Lynch, who also directed this brilliance of a film. Another powerful thing to note is John Morris' amazing, perfectly suitable circus music. Each time it is used is in the perfect scenes where Merrick is being used like a circus freak. For example, the scene where Merrick is being thrown around and played with by the mob has this great music in the background. The harsher the mob gets, the more intense the music gets, which just adds to your anger at the people using Merrick for fun.I like to imagine that the scene where Merrick dies isn't merely sad because he's trying to be like everyone else. It left me happy. Merrick didn't know whether he'd survive sleeping like that. He died believing that he was loved by so many. He was so happy. The only person I feel sad about in the end was Treves, because he'd have to continue living knowing that his friend was dead. Merrick died a happy, hopeful death.This masterpiece of a film left me filled with so many different emotions. I swear I came out of this wiser and more fulfilled. It made such an impact on me, an indescribable impact. Not once did I find myself turning away, I was enthralled by it. I knew what I was going to see before watching it and knew of what basically happens in the film, but somehow it still left me amazed and touched. I never expected it to be this great. I would say more, but I think other reviewers have said everything else I have to say already. What a truly remarkable masterpiece.
