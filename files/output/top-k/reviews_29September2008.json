This question has been explored for its significance in metaphysics in other movies as well. The Thirteenth Floor is one of them and the other is Dark City.

Advertisements have been created based on the themes of this movie. Most people seem to have heard of the movie if not seen it. The Matrix enjoys a prominent position in the top 50 on the IMDb. Even a list of 100 best movies of all times as compiled by a documentary on the Discovery Channel mentioned this movie as among the top 100. The key to the enormous success of the Matrix is the symbiotic combination of two opposing elements. The first one being metaphysics or philosophy and the second element being intense amount of action. The Dark City is limited in its action and stresses more on the metaphysics aspect and so does the Thirteenth floor. When you see The Matrix, you see that there is far more metaphysics and philosophy in this movie when compared to the other two. And when you see the action sequences of the movie, the two movies fade into oblivion. There is so much for the intellectual to busy himself with in this movie. There is a reference to so many mythological places and figures. The character Neo is an anagram of One signifying the One Absolute many cultures believe in and then there is Trinity, an obvious reference to the Holy Trinity. The names of the ships, the numbers on the door, the name of the book Neo takes his CD out from all have a significance, a clue, if that is what one wants to call it. This movie gives enough to the intellectual to study and talk about. And yet the movie does not fail to capture the attention of the average movie goer. The average movie goer does not want to search for hidden symbols, he does not want to discuss the movie for hours and hours. He wants some action and some fun. The movie gives that as well. The movie has a lot of guns, a lot of chases and a lot of fighting. The average movie goer can appreciate the main aspect of this movie without bothering about all the hidden symbols which the intellectual chooses to see in the movie. Yet, he apparently does not deny himself the spirit of the movie and enjoys it. And I believe this is what has made the movie successful - the reconciliation between action and thrill and metaphysics and philosophy. This movie deserves all the praise and success that it has got. My personal all-time favorite. I never get tired of talking about it till date and love to see it with my friends if I get the chance.

Some people do not like it because it is an action movie. Some people do not like it because it takes a well established, tried and tested plot of hostile aliens, rather than the friendly alien like ET. Some people have a problem because of the eventual method that is used by one of the lead characters of the movie in order to bring down the defense system of the aliens. But I do not find any of this too objectionable to down rate this movie as much as I have seen it has been. The story starts with alien space ships taking strategic positions across the various major cities of the world. We see an amazing effect of the city being engulfed by the shadow of the mammoth space ship hovering over it. And then, people are divided in opinions about the intention of these spaceships. Of course, it is clear from the kind of positions the ships take that the intentions are more hostile than friendly. But yet people literally throw a welcoming party for the aliens and of course pay a price for it. Some of these things have led to severe criticism from many viewers and critics. But let us put these aside for a while and see what happens next. The alien ship fires an incredibly powerful weapon that leaves the city in wreck. The sound and sight of this destruction is the strength of the movie. The movie is about war and it is war that this movie shows beautifully. And the next thing you have is an attempt by the best fighter planes trying to take the ship out. But they realize that there is a computerized shield that protects the ship. The movie follows through and finally shows the computer wizard realizing that a computer virus can disable the ship's shields for enough time so as to allow an obliteration of the ships. Again, many people have criticized this. Well, the argument goes that a civilization so advanced could not be weak enough for a virus. But there are many things we do not know about this civilization. Let us not forget that it our tendency to think in a certain way that eventually led to the creation of viruses. Did the aliens think in the same way? Mostly not! Thoughts, ideas and civilization, in general, would have advanced completely differently for them and they surely would not have even heard of a computer virus. So, I personally feel that this idea is not as bad as people are calling it. For smooth fight sequences and computer graphics, this movie is in a different league altogether. I cannot think of a better way of doing all the action sequences. Critics may argue that there are loop holes in the plot and yes, some of these loop holes are strong enough to ensure the movie does not go down in cinematic history, but I still would like to give it a ten on ten for I have found the merits overwhelmingly more striking than the demerits.

What if someone could actually pull this off? Would the world really be that much better off than what it was previously? These were some of the question I was asking myself after I saw this movie for the first time. It was a captivating movie that made me really wonder if what I saw was possible. The movie is Boondock Saints (1999), one of the greatest action thrillers I have every seen. Troy Duffy, the movies producer and writer, combined a cast and crew that formulated a perfect story of two Irish Boston brothers who find themselves at the center of Boston's crime scene. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus play Irish brothers, Connor and Murphy MacManus and David Della Rocco plays the brother's best friend, the funny man. The movie is rated R for strong violence, language and sexual content. This movie was even banned from some theaters due to the graphic nature of the film. The movie begins in Boston on Saint Patrick's Day and for most Irish men, St. Patty's Day is a big event. However, for these two Irish brothers, this holiday will be one they will never forget. It starts when they get in a bar fight with two members of the Russian Mob. The MacManus brothers make it back to their apartment safely that night, but in the morning the Russian Mobsters track the brothers down and break into their apartment. They're looking to kill. The brothers however, turn the tables on the mobsters and violently slay them with what seems to be a little help from a higher being. They turn themselves into the police but are let go, since, in most people's eyes, what they have done has been a good thing for the society. The brothers see this as a sign from God and begin roaming the city and killing all criminals that are causing harm to the citizens of Boston. They massacre several groups of criminals in a violent and bloody fashion that captivates the audience. With a twist at the end that no one sees coming, this movie gets a rating of four stars out of five. The only thing I would have liked to see was more plot detail and better Irish ascents. However, the good outweighs the bad just like the bullets fly just as easy as people breathe.The main characters are identified early, being the MacManus brothers, The Funny Man, the FBI agent, and all the criminals the brothers intend to slaughter. The plot is simple and straightforward. It has one twist but not until the end, however, it is a twist that leaves the viewer a little stunned. The setting, Boston, Massachusetts, is an appropriate city for the shooting of this movie. With ties to the Russian Mob, Boston was the right pick. This gives the movie a little more authenticity and realism. Authenticity also comes through in the form of symbols, including the pennies, which are symbols of currency so the dead have something to offer to get into the afterlife and the rope, which symbolizes irony and struggle between the brothers. The costumes of the mob members are perfect to what the common person thinks a Russian Mobster should wear, including flashy white suits with gold chains and chest hair sticking out the top of the collar. And the color black, which the brother's wear, is perfect for the dark and suspicious roles that they play. Makeup also plays a major role in this movie. With all the blood shed, someone has to make it look real. Mario G. Cacioppo did just that as the films makeup artist. Especially, when the brothers and The Funny Man had to iron their wounds shut since they could not go to the hospital due to the fear of getting caught. The music used gives the viewer a sense that they are watching something so dramatic that anything could happen at anytime and gives it a true dramatic movie feel. The music has almost a religious tone to it that make it seem like they are performing Gods work. Along with the music, the camera angles also show that the brothers are empowered. They are often shown with close up shots and shots with the camera down below as if they have a lot of power. They also use aspects like slow motion to make the scenes more dramatic and commanding. Boondock Saints obviously displays many literary, theatric, and cinematic elements within the movie that make it a stellar film. However, one of the most powerful parts of the movie is a simple prayer the brother's say every time they execute one of their victims. Sheppard's we shall be, For thee, my Lord, for thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand, Our feet may swiftly carry out Thy commands. So we shall flow a river forth to Thee, And teeming with souls shall it ever be. In Nomeni Patri Et Fili Spiritus Sancti. I found this prayer very powerful and, oddly, I got goose bumps every time I heard it.

It has all the right elements in it. A good plot, a good cast, good action sequences and a wonderful director in the form of James Cameron. The story is about a machine that looks like a human being, a cyborg, who has been sent back in time in order to kill a certain lady named Sarah Conner. She has to be killed so that John Conner, who is her son, does not exist. His birth has to be prevented because John Conner is going to lead the human resistance against the machines. Needless to say, it is the machines that have sent back this machine to do the job. But the human resistance is well aware of this mission and plot. So, the human resistance sends a noble warrior to aid Sarah Conner. And no, this warrior is not a machine too. He is a human being but someone who comes from a time where he has seen enough of these machines to know how to possibly take care of one to some extent. And the chase is on. The Terminator hunts down Sarah and tries to do his job. And of course, there is someone who is going to prevent that from happening. Arnold has a perfect physique and the right face to play the role of the cyborg. It is not that easy to be expressionless like a cyborg and Arnold convinces us thoroughly that he indeed is a machine who just happens to look like a human being. Sarah's protector does a wonderful job as the human warrior that he is. Linda Hamilton, playing Sarah also brings about the right range of expressions to suit her role. All in all, the cast is fantastic. And add to this, the beautiful and clean direction of Cameron and the wonderful special effects, this movie becomes what it is - a great masterpiece. There are some people of course who find this movie a little dull compared to the second part of the movie i.e. Terminator 2  Judgment Day. There is no doubt about the fact that T2 is indeed a wonderful movie but at the same time one must not forget that this movie comes out way before T2 and considering the time in which the movie was made, what has been showcased in this chapter of the Terminator story, is simply amazing.

It has all the right elements in it. A good plot, a good cast, good action sequences and a wonderful director in the form of James Cameron. The story is about a machine that looks like a human being, a cyborg, who has been sent back in time in order to kill a certain lady named Sarah Conner. She has to be killed so that John Conner, who is her son, does not exist. His birth has to be prevented because John Conner is going to lead the human resistance against the machines. Needless to say, it is the machines that have sent back this machine to do the job. But the human resistance is well aware of this mission and plot. So, the human resistance sends a noble warrior to aid Sarah Conner. And no, this warrior is not a machine too. He is a human being but someone who comes from a time where he has seen enough of these machines to know how to possibly take care of one to some extent. And the chase is on.

The Houseman family traveled to New York for a family vacation, and came home with a well-matured daughter and a closer relationship as a family. Dirty Dancing opens with the family driving through the mountains to their vacation destination. Upon arriving at the resort, the owner, Jack Weston, tries to put his matchmaking skills into practice and attempts to set up Baby, an ambitious, daddy's little girl who wants to join the Peace Corps, with his selfish, cocky grandson. Fortunately, Baby sees right past Mr. Weston's plan and discovers how much of a spoiled brat his grandson really is. Plus, she has her eyes on someone else and that is Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), the best-looking and top dancer at the entire resort.In search of adventure and a fun vacation, Baby discovers one night in the staff's dormitories a whole different world in contrast to that of the structured, resort atmosphere. Rock'n'roll music is blaring from the stereo and the entire staff is inside dancing in a way Baby had never seen before. This is the first night Johnny saw her. Initially, he does not care about her in the least, but he soon starts falling for her when Baby fills in for Johnny's dance partner, Penny, after she becomes pregnant and cannot dance. Complications from Penny's abortion cause Baby to ask her medical doctor dad to help Penny and he assumes it was Johnny's baby. Her dad forbids Baby from seeing Johnny, but do teenage girls listen to their parents? That answer is a clear No. Baby continues seeing him, learning how to dance and falling more and more in love with him. Inevitably, turmoil occurs on several fronts. For the much anticipated last dance of the season, Johnny chooses Baby to be his partner. After all, as Johnny so aptly puts it, No one puts Baby in a corner. There are many cinematic, theatrical, and literary elements that enhance this movie. The director does a good job of casting Johnny as a god-like figure to Baby by using low angles when the camera is on him. This is especially noticeable at the beginning of the movie when Baby sees him as a powerful, strong, and untouchable being. In addition, Baby is cast in some high angles at the beginning of the movie, where she is portrayed to be an innocent, powerless daddy's girl. By the end of the movie, she breaks out of this role. In the dancing scenes, there are many close-up and medium shots that portray the emotion of the dancers about what they are doing and how they feel about each other. The set, at Kellerman's summer resort, is a perfect place. It is out away from the busy cities and allows the characters to interact with each other. The two main settings &#150; the dance floor and the rest of the resort &#150; allow the audience to see Baby's struggle of discovering herself. The dance floor can be a symbol of what Baby becomes at the end of the movie, a strong-willed, free-spirited young lady, while the rest of the resort can be the symbol of the life that Baby is leaving behind. The resort represents Baby's innocence and her sheltered life.The summer of 1963 changed Baby's life forever. She became a mature young lady in the setting of her former innocent, sheltered world. Dirty Dancing portrays the trials and tribulations that every girl faces while growing up and becoming her own person. Although this movie is predictable in its conclusion, I personally love watching it whenever possible. I highly suggest it for any young girl dreaming of what she will become as she grows up.

My favorite scene was where Stallone gets completely angry with a guy who blocks a seat of an old lady and teaches him a nice lesson. And there is a scene where Stallone and Stone get to be in the shower together but that is more like an example of how not to pair up someone. Perhaps a major drawback in the movie is this pairing of Stallone and Stone.Sylvester Stallone was either given an incomplete character or Stallone simply chose to play him as a silent man with no expressions. It is difficult to tell whether the role became what it was because of Stallone or was it some fault in the creative path of the director and the story writer. But this character neither inspires nor does he invoke any sympathy from the viewers. You can identify with Rocky and Rambo and be inspired by them or feel sorry for them but not this character. The character is too lifeless.But there are some really decent effects in the movie. The action may seem extravagant at times but considering this is meant to be an action film, this aspect can always be excused.

Huw's brains and his temporary physical disability set him apart from his brothers and consider a future out of coal-mining. That also makes him a better observer of the changes that would happen to his land along the years.What I have written above is pretty much what happens in the movie too, naturally but as someone who always tries to read the book first before seeing an adaptation I did not find the same flavor in the movie.

In the movie there is an impression that as if Angharad was forced to marry him though she only met the local minister. While the movie focuses on Angharad and her dysfunctional family relationships it never mentions the relationship between Margen and Owen and his giving her away to his brother. Because of this very focus, you would think, Angharad is the only daughter in the family because Ceridwen does not exist in the movie either. Besides, Huw sounds more like a challenging boy no matter how vulnerable he may seem. In the movie one won't see it. For instance, in the book it is How himself who jumps and shout back at Mr. Parry in the meeting of deacons for Meillyn Lewis.

It feels as if the two knew each other since childhood, almost as if they were like brothers; they hug, they argue, they throw insults at one another, but most of all, they stick by each other especially when one or both are in danger. Most reviewers will tell you everything you need to know about Running Scared, but I'll just make it short and straight to the point. Ray Hughes (Hines) and Danny Costanzo (Crystal)are a pair of devoted cops who are willing to sacrifice their own lives and maybe even their own jobs thanks to their reckless ways and their rule-breaking tactics. After spending a quiet time from the mean streets of Chicago, to the sunny skies in Florida,by order of their boss, a major drug ring operation is in tact. A familiar face named Julio Gonzales (Jimmy Smits) who has tried to kill them before, puts our two heroes in danger who try to play it safe and to avoid being killed. In an unorthodox manner, they call for backup and start sporting bulletproof vests. From other reviewers, many like me, compare this movie to Lethal Weapon, and Die Hard which is a good comparison, but the genre is more reliant on action rather than comedy. Beverly Hills Cop is in the right direction, but the best connection to Running Scared is Stakeout starring Emilio Estevez and Richard Dreyfus which a buddy-cop comedy, with plenty of exciting comedy but the chemistry between Dreyfus and Estevez is very much like the chemistry Hines and Crystal depict here. But overall Running Scared has the chemistry between the two cops that can't be compared which is what makes this buddy-cop movie extraordinary. It deserves at least one look.

Although it's not the greatest buddy-cop film ever made, but it still ranks high in entertainment, witty dialog and to top it all off, the wonderful chemistry between the two leads (Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines). It feels as if the two knew each other since childhood, almost as if they were like brothers; they hug, they argue, they throw insults at one another, but most of all, they stick by each other especially when one or both are in danger. Most reviewers will tell you everything you need to know about Running Scared, but I'll just make it short and straight to the point. Ray Hughes (Hines) and Danny Costanzo (Crystal)are a pair of devoted cops who are willing to sacrifice their own lives and maybe even their own jobs thanks to their reckless ways and their rule-breaking tactics.

Yet there is a third who by rights should join them. This actor made but one film, yet his ability to project bravery, loyalty, compassion and the boisterous joy of living through his acting was, many believe, without parallel. He died at the height of his fame, a mere three years after his triumphant success in this film. Let there now be three stars in that tragic but noble pantheon...Dean, Mineo and Beasley. And let it be recognized, without envy or jealousy, that Beasley's ability to project drool was far greater and more accurate than Dean and Mineo combined. Turner & Hooch is a low key, modest comedy crime caper with a heavy dose of light romance thrown in. Tom Hanks plays Detective Scott Turner, a young man who is far too neat for his own good. He's about to transfer from his small town of Cypress Beach to the big city when a friend, an old man played by that great character actor John McIntire, is murdered. Turner delays his move and pleads with his police chief to be given the case. He's sure the old man's dog, a big, slobbering French Mastiff named Hooch (Beasley) saw what happened and can help identify the killer. Turner agrees to have Hooch live with him while he's on the case. Not to cut the plot to short, Turner and Hooch solve the case, but not without wild car chases, tense shoot-outs, money laundering, veterinary examinations, furniture chewing, refrigerator raiding and a lot of slobber. The movie's plot, of course, is just an excuse to allow two actors with great likability to do their stuff. Hanks had by now already proved how skilled a light comedy actor he was. More to the point, he had the sort of personality and slightly goofy looks that created instant empathy with an audience. Beasley, however, was the surprise. A novice actor, he was an unknown without even off-Broadway experience. He carried out his role with the skill and subtlety of a pro. Just as some actors can cause real tears to run down their faces at the command of a director, Beasley was uncanny in his ability to generate, as needed, drool. His resourcefulness also has become legend. In one scene, the sight of Hanks prancing around his apartment wearing a pair of tighty-whities (black ones) threatened to derail Hollywood's gay fashion industry. Fortunately, Beasley suggested quietly to the director that some amusing antics on his part might distract the audience from the odd awfulness of Hank's appearance. He was right. Yet the scene where Hanks and Beasley are on the pier and Scott Turner must wrestle Hooch to the police car is a fine example of ensemble acting by two talented and unselfish actors, each totally into their characters and yet giving fully to the other. At the end of the movie the murder has been solved, the mastermind unmasked and young Turner has become chief of police. He has a wife, the veterinarian Dr. Emily Carson (played winningly by Mare Winningham). They have a baby on the way. They will remember Hooch in many ways, and so will Emily's collie. I like Turner & Hooch a lot. It's pleasant entertainment with two likable and skilled actors and a story that hangs together. Wherever in that pantheon they reside, I'm sure Dean and Mineo are working with Beasley, now all of them close friends, to perfect slobber on command.

But it meshes everything. Frankly, I know a way to sum up the film in a way that demonstrates its appeal How many movies have you seen or will you ever see that take place in rural post-apocalyptic 1950s France? OK, a few. Wow. You really know your movies. Well just how many of them have involved cannibalism? I didn't think so, Leonard Maltin.Consider a plot in which food is a stunted resource, in which grain is used as legal tender. The landlord of a dilapidated apartment building runs a butcher shop within, posting job opportunities attract people whom he butchers as an economical source of meat that he sells to his tenants.The protagonist is an out-of-work circus clown played by the very strange Dominique Pinon who arrives for an available job. Taking up residence, he gradually falls in love with the bookish daughter of the landlord. Alert to her father's intentions and Pinon's pending murder, we of course anticipate the story's progression. Delicatessen rewards us at a much fresher degree than most movies, even ones better than this, as she goes down into the sewers to get in touch with a notorious vegetarian subgroup of rebels whom she convinces to help rescue our hero.One reason I enjoyed the film is because, being a movie called Delicatessen with a picture of a pig on what is portrayed as a hanging butcher shop sign as the film's poster and DVD case image, it is in fact endearing for animal lovers like me. By the era depicted by the story, by the time the movie opens, animals have been hunted to extinction, and humans must suffer the consequences of such excesses at the expense of fellow creatures. Pinon's character mourns for his dead circus partner, his best friend, his monkey. The movie has a lightness of touch and does not intend to brandish a message at the viewer regarding a dystopian future, and we may accept the film however we wish.This tongue-in-cheek Gothic fantasy is directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and the same collaborator with whom he made The City of Lost Children, a similar film with incredible imagination and flair.

He is introduced as a seemingly average individual; one who does not attract much attention let alone curiosity. In fact, my attention was originally geared heavily towards Watanabe's story simply because his struggle to choose a favorite memory evoked a lot of interest and mind participation. Contrariwise, Mochizuki seemed to possess no inner conflict that was worthy of inquiry, although his outer conflict, too, at first seemed mildly intriguing (i.e. having to help Watanabe find a memory). Ironically, however, as the beauty of Watanabe's character unraveled, it carefully led to the discovery and beauty of Mochizuki's character.Both of their worlds merged together during private interview sessions, creating long awaited answers and long lost harmonies between their pasts. They learn in one particular session that they both share the same dilemma the battle to choose a perfect memory. In addition to sharing the same dilemma, they also share the same generation as well as lover (Kyoko). With these discoveries, they both become, in a sense, the symbol of overlapping ovals portrayed on the institution's flag; a metaphor for how it takes two people earnestly involved in the other's life to discover self-identity. Each needs the other and each becomes part of the other person's discovery of happiness.Given these revelations into Mochizuki's past, his character suddenly becomes incredibly dynamic and provocative; one who is on the same empathetic level as Watanabe. We learn that he is not simply at the institution to help others find their memories, but that the entire staff, including himself, is placed in counseling positions because they themselves never chose a memory to live with for eternity. It would seem, then, that the staff is being poetically revealed by the director as restless beings living in purgatory.The idea of restlessness and inner turmoil (in the staff) is illustrated by the contrasts of camera movement. In the beginning, most of the shots are static and evenly framed. We are observing the majority of shots through the staff's eyes, which gives the film a documentary type lens (especially during the interviews). As a result, this type of camera-work creates the illusion of making the audience think that the staff is well-balanced and in control, both internally and externally. After all, they are the ones with the camera and choose how to focus the shots during interviews. The irony of this, however, is later exposed when we learn that each staff member's progression towards heaven is stultified because they never chose a memory&#151;hence their positions as staff members. As soon as we learn this (which if I recall happens on Thursday) the camera-work becomes more hand-held, shaky and off kilter.This contrast in camera-work becomes even more beautiful and poignant because it also reflects the two stages that the staff undergoes during both preproduction and production of those whose lives they wish to change. In preproduction, they gather all the material they need from the recently deceased (via interviews) in order to recreate their memories on film. The preproduction sequences (the interviews) are shot with well balanced and controlled frames (perhaps an expression of the more controlled side of film-making). As the staff travels into the actual production of recreating their guests' memories, the camera-work then turns towards the more shaky and imbalanced frames (perhaps an expression of the more difficult and chaotic part of film-making the actual shooting itself).It was as if the camera was making a philosophical commentary on the nature of freewill and its relation to heaven and hell. That is, to choose explicitly one's destiny (or in this case, one's memory) means to live a well balanced, evenly framed existence; and contrariwise, to explicitly not choose one's destiny, but to neutrally balk on the sidelines means to live an existence of uncertainty and imbalance.This leads now to the reason I chose Mochizuki. Unlike most who surround him, he willingly chooses to end his inner pain by realizing (with the help of others) that true happiness is not found by dwelling upon one's own memories, but by being a part of some else's memories. When asked about his earliest memory, he recalls an intense and vivid memory of snow. Snow is a symbol of his rebirth; the delicate and soft coat that whitens out his previous life and gives birth to his new life&#151;a life that he was only able to discover through the people he met at the institution, and more especially his relationship with Watanabe. The memory he chooses, then, becomes his realization into the insight of what happiness is; a simple moment that came full circle into his mind as he sat on a nostalgic park bench thinking about those in whom he loved.

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"29 September 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I would like to observe the character arc of counselor Mochizuki and how he grew within the one week period at the afterlife institution. He is introduced as a seemingly average individual; one who does not attract much attention let alone curiosity. In fact, my attention was originally geared heavily towards Watanabe's story simply because his struggle to choose a favorite memory evoked a lot of interest and mind participation. Contrariwise, Mochizuki seemed to possess no inner conflict that was worthy of inquiry, although his outer conflict, too, at first seemed mildly intriguing (i.e. having to help Watanabe find a memory). Ironically, however, as the beauty of Watanabe's character unraveled, it carefully led to the discovery and beauty of Mochizuki's character.Both of their worlds merged together during private interview sessions, creating long awaited answers and long lost harmonies between their pasts. They learn in one particular session that they both share the same dilemma the battle to choose a perfect memory. In addition to sharing the same dilemma, they also share the same generation as well as lover (Kyoko). With these discoveries, they both become, in a sense, the symbol of overlapping ovals portrayed on the institution's flag; a metaphor for how it takes two people earnestly involved in the other's life to discover self-identity. Each needs the other and each becomes part of the other person's discovery of happiness.Given these revelations into Mochizuki's past, his character suddenly becomes incredibly dynamic and provocative; one who is on the same empathetic level as Watanabe. We learn that he is not simply at the institution to help others find their memories, but that the entire staff, including himself, is placed in counseling positions because they themselves never chose a memory to live with for eternity. It would seem, then, that the staff is being poetically revealed by the director as restless beings living in purgatory.The idea of restlessness and inner turmoil (in the staff) is illustrated by the contrasts of camera movement. In the beginning, most of the shots are static and evenly framed. We are observing the majority of shots through the staff's eyes, which gives the film a documentary type lens (especially during the interviews). As a result, this type of camera-work creates the illusion of making the audience think that the staff is well-balanced and in control, both internally and externally. After all, they are the ones with the camera and choose how to focus the shots during interviews. The irony of this, however, is later exposed when we learn that each staff member's progression towards heaven is stultified because they never chose a memory&#151;hence their positions as staff members. As soon as we learn this (which if I recall happens on Thursday) the camera-work becomes more hand-held, shaky and off kilter.This contrast in camera-work becomes even more beautiful and poignant because it also reflects the two stages that the staff undergoes during both preproduction and production of those whose lives they wish to change. In preproduction, they gather all the material they need from the recently deceased (via interviews) in order to recreate their memories on film. The preproduction sequences (the interviews) are shot with well balanced and controlled frames (perhaps an expression of the more controlled side of film-making). As the staff travels into the actual production of recreating their guests' memories, the camera-work then turns towards the more shaky and imbalanced frames (perhaps an expression of the more difficult and chaotic part of film-making the actual shooting itself).It was as if the camera was making a philosophical commentary on the nature of freewill and its relation to heaven and hell.

It does not, by any means, signify that Brooks and Williams actually collaborated on the screenplay.That being said, I am writing this the week of Paul Newman's death from cancer, the week of all those heartfelt tributes, the week of all those in memoriam videos everywhere.If you ever read any honest autobiographies by Hollywood actors, you will find that all of them, including Laurence Olivier by the way, once they have reached the pinnacle of fame, eventually conclude that their 'career' was a sham, a put-on, something which accomplished nothing in the world at all except giving people temporary emotional highs, a life of 'work' which would be something a healthy adult would be ashamed of as infantile. Olivier described the 'art' as being a prostitute, since the common denominator of film is the audience's lust for one star or another.So Paul Newman in Cat On A Hot Tin Roof delivers a performance which is carefully tuned to stir both women and men, even though the homosexual content of Williams' original play is consigned to a subtext. The motivation for Newman's sexual estrangement from Elizabeth Taylor simply doesn't exist in the movie. Who needs valid motivation, Brooks must have thought, if you can distract the audience with gorgeous Taylor and her failed attempts at seduction? The story of Skipper is a convoluted mess I dare anyone to really make sense of in any way, and that goes for both the heterosexual and homosexual versions. Somebody would have flunked Screen writing 101 if they had turned this in, but with Williams' name on the page, and the director Brooks putting in his two cents, we get stuck with it. What we have here is a totally inept adaptation of the play, which leaves the audience to flounder around trying to get some kind of satisfaction out of lecherous eying of the leads, as well as the trite treatment of yet another whining 'unloving father' saga, and the trite treatment of yet another 'death comes to all' pseudo-revelation.Rather than great drama, Cat On A Hot Tin Roof is reduced to 'dime-a-dozen' clichés. No wonder Tennessee Williams told people not to go to see it.Paul Newman gives a shallow performance. As other commentators have noted, he does not portray an alcoholic, but a pretty boy having a few drinks, and the drinks never affect his movements or his speech. If you want to see a portrayal of an alcoholic, watch Ray Milland in The Lost Weekend. Or watch Clark Gable in The Misfits. Newman can't hold a candle to either performance, and he doesn't even try!To excuse this by considering Taylor's remark that Newman hasn't lost his looks even though he drinks, doesn't help the case. A handsome man who is an alcoholic wreck is still handsome and still desirable. Brooks' allowing Newman to take a pass like this, just so he can look like a matinée idol, proves the director had no intention whatever of doing right by the play.Newman gets to lose his temper, flail his cane around, smash some pottery. This is not acting.However, in today's bland movie culture, I suppose young people are impressed by this. It used to be called chewing up the scenery.Newman's legacy is his charitable work. He realized better than anyone that his acting career for over 40 years gave him wealth and fame he had never really earned. And so he tried to redeem himself with 'good works'. I believe Newman also had a death wish, but he didn't die driving a race car, although this was his 'second' career. He eventually looked to helping children, and thank God for that.As for the 'famous marriage' of Newman and Joanne Woodward, whose movies together were one soft porn piece after another, one interview they did together in their old age really tells the full story. In New Orleans, in the early years of their marriage, Woodward had spotted an extremely large bed in an antique store. She said she just had to buy it, once she found out that due to its 'extra-large size,'it had been used in a downtown brothel. Both Newman and his wife smiled for the camera as she shared, with a laugh, that the bed was still upstairs in their master bedroom. Consider that story a fitting metaphor for the whole Hollywood travesty.There is such a thing as a good play. Drama can indeed provide an experience which develops personal maturity and a heightened appreciation of human values. As for myself, I don't accept counterfeits.

In Jackie Brown, Tarantino pulled off from that very sentence what he set out to do. The film is a quite simplistic and laid back experience for most of the time, only branching off at certain points with that distinct flair Tarantino brings to his films when it needs to. This is most evident during the actual trading of bags in the shopping mall, something Tarantino announces is about to happen with a title card and a cheeky fourth wall breaking comment 'For real this time'.But leading up to this heist or exchange or whatever is a thoroughly rewarding and distinct journey littered with realism; menace; great dialogue; great acting and individual personas for each of the characters. Given that Tarantino includes characters in Jackie Brown of the stoner, surfer bimbo and flight attendant variety and for him to make them come across as anything but the clichés and caricatures we have become to associate with them is a triumph in itself. Part of this is down to casting; having De Niro play Louis, a bank robber recently out of jail and addicted to drugs is one thing but resisting casting a young man in the role and resisting having him talkative and naïve in that 'stoner' caricature we could all associate with him is another. If anything, Louis could take the drugs to keep him calm since the instant we see him spending long amounts of time away from the pad and away from the drugs, he becomes very irritable and somewhat dangerous.Then you have the other 'types' that could so easily have been typecast but people like ATF enforcer Ray Nicolette (Keaton) is more than a typical policeman or agent with a badge and an ego, he wants to help Jackie and at certain points wants to get to know her whilst carrying a certain quirkiness attributed to Keaton's approach to the character. So if Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs were all about breaking down stereotypes in a well worn genre then Jackie Brown is the continuation of this, albeit on a lower scale. The film could fall into crime, possibly even neo-noir and quite possibly romance. There are some blurry lines as to who is playing the protagonist in the noir-inspired sense as bail bondsman Max Cherry (Forster) could clearly be given the 'down on his luck' lead role and Jackie the femme fatale or Cherry could simply be labelled an ally and Jackie (who's equally down on her luck) is the anti-hero playing everyone off against each other. The film is named Jackie Brown after all, but if we can learn anything from the final scene and garner anything from the film overall then it's feasible Max is the best and most interesting character.Jackie Brown is perhaps the most conventional of Tarantino's films; certainly at the time and certainly with hindsight also. It adopts a straight and linear path that only become complicated when it branches off to show its several primary characters' actions. In terms of manipulating the linear passage of things, Jackie Brown rarely toys with formula until it is absolutely necessary to drop the viewer into chaos of the mind as they frantically backtrack and work out who's where and why they might be. This is done during the most important scene in the film and feels like the climactic heist as everything comes together and fits into place but really, Tarantino is using it as a set up for the bigger picture; the attempted acquiring of a gun runner.At the core of the film is a strong female character and how often can you come away saying there is such a thing in a film that contains gun runners; stoners and could quite feasibly fall into the noir genre? Incidentally when Max first sees Jackie, played by Pam Grier, leaving the jail house his look is constructed around the gaze theory but one thing I noticed that may be deliberate by Tarantino is that she isn't fetishised or presented in an objective fashion. This is down to two things; firstly Tarantino places her about two dozen feet away from the watching Max and secondly, given the dystopian locale of the jail house we've previously been presented with, Jackie has this aura about her that does not demand an attractive labelling. She is a mess, with scraggly hair; well worn clothes; air miles under her belt for that particular day and generally unglamorous.Following her brush with death at the hands of gunrunner Ordell Robbie (Jackson), who is equally brilliantly set up in all his ruthless glory, the film divulges into the seedy world of apartments bought with blood money, malls, mall car parks and police station offices. The splashes of Tarantino are evident in random flashes of violence; eventual non-linear story telling and a mock cartoon bird's eye view of a flight from Mexico to America. The soundtrack of light, mellow love songs adds a depth to Jackie Brown as Max gently eases his way into feeling for the woman as the meetings escalate between the two. The manner in which each character is fleshed out in their own retrospect's and the efficiency of most scenes involving Jackson's Ordell Robbie as well as Cherry's gradual relationship with Brown are some of the reasons Jackie Brown goes down as and will remain as one of my favourite films.

If anything, Louis could take the drugs to keep him calm since the instant we see him spending long amounts of time away from the pad and away from the drugs, he becomes very irritable and somewhat dangerous.Then you have the other 'types' that could so easily have been typecast but people like ATF enforcer Ray Nicolette (Keaton) is more than a typical policeman or agent with a badge and an ego, he wants to help Jackie and at certain points wants to get to know her whilst carrying a certain quirkiness attributed to Keaton's approach to the character. So if Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs were all about breaking down stereotypes in a well worn genre then Jackie Brown is the continuation of this, albeit on a lower scale. The film could fall into crime, possibly even neo-noir and quite possibly romance. There are some blurry lines as to who is playing the protagonist in the noir-inspired sense as bail bondsman Max Cherry (Forster) could clearly be given the 'down on his luck' lead role and Jackie the femme fatale or Cherry could simply be labelled an ally and Jackie (who's equally down on her luck) is the anti-hero playing everyone off against each other. The film is named Jackie Brown after all, but if we can learn anything from the final scene and garner anything from the film overall then it's feasible Max is the best and most interesting character.Jackie Brown is perhaps the most conventional of Tarantino's films; certainly at the time and certainly with hindsight also. It adopts a straight and linear path that only become complicated when it branches off to show its several primary characters' actions. In terms of manipulating the linear passage of things, Jackie Brown rarely toys with formula until it is absolutely necessary to drop the viewer into chaos of the mind as they frantically backtrack and work out who's where and why they might be. This is done during the most important scene in the film and feels like the climactic heist as everything comes together and fits into place but really, Tarantino is using it as a set up for the bigger picture; the attempted acquiring of a gun runner.At the core of the film is a strong female character and how often can you come away saying there is such a thing in a film that contains gun runners; stoners and could quite feasibly fall into the noir genre? Incidentally when Max first sees Jackie, played by Pam Grier, leaving the jail house his look is constructed around the gaze theory but one thing I noticed that may be deliberate by Tarantino is that she isn't fetishised or presented in an objective fashion. This is down to two things; firstly Tarantino places her about two dozen feet away from the watching Max and secondly, given the dystopian locale of the jail house we've previously been presented with, Jackie has this aura about her that does not demand an attractive labelling. She is a mess, with scraggly hair; well worn clothes; air miles under her belt for that particular day and generally unglamorous.Following her brush with death at the hands of gunrunner Ordell Robbie (Jackson), who is equally brilliantly set up in all his ruthless glory, the film divulges into the seedy world of apartments bought with blood money, malls, mall car parks and police station offices. The splashes of Tarantino are evident in random flashes of violence; eventual non-linear story telling and a mock cartoon bird's eye view of a flight from Mexico to America. The soundtrack of light, mellow love songs adds a depth to Jackie Brown as Max gently eases his way into feeling for the woman as the meetings escalate between the two. The manner in which each character is fleshed out in their own retrospect's and the efficiency of most scenes involving Jackson's Ordell Robbie as well as Cherry's gradual relationship with Brown are some of the reasons Jackie Brown goes down as and will remain as one of my favourite films.

In Jackie Brown, Tarantino pulled off from that very sentence what he set out to do. The film is a quite simplistic and laid back experience for most of the time, only branching off at certain points with that distinct flair Tarantino brings to his films when it needs to. This is most evident during the actual trading of bags in the shopping mall, something Tarantino announces is about to happen with a title card and a cheeky fourth wall breaking comment 'For real this time'.But leading up to this heist or exchange or whatever is a thoroughly rewarding and distinct journey littered with realism; menace; great dialogue; great acting and individual personas for each of the characters.
