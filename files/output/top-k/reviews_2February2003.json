As far as I can tell, Adrian Lyne had one hit film.  That was FATAL ATTRACTION in 1987.  That was a long time ago and with LOLITA being so bad it didn't even get released, he must have decided to simply re-work the formula from FATAL ATTRACTION in hopes of rescuing his career.  Here is a formula for making Adrian Lyne Movies.  First of all, cast only good-looking people...no normal people allowed.  No love handles, male pattern baldness or big noses or anything remotely resembling reality.  In this case, we have Diane Lane and Richard Gere (Michael Douglas must have wanted too much money).  Also, they can't just be good-looking.  They must be rich as well.  This couple must be related to the Kennedys somehow.  They are filthy rich and neither of them ever really seems to have to break a sweat or even go to work.  I think the wife is on her way to work (or a fundraiser...is that work?) when she is flattened by a monsoon but she is late to work so she just decides never to go back and it's never mentioned again.  Must be nice and I want a job doing whatever it is Richard Gere is doing in this film...it's easy money for sure.  He yells at someone on the phone and fires someone for no particular reason (other than to keep the plot moving)but otherwise never does anything.  Second rule, hire only cinematographers with plenty of experience shooting shampoo commercials to give the inevitable sex-scenes an artsy look.  Third rule, one member of the good-looking and rich couple must have an affair on the other for no particular reason.  Fourth, there will be soft-core sex scenes.  There will be not one but about 3 sex scenes in every Adrian Lyne movie I ever saw.  The last piece of the formula is the ever-present, unending music score.  I can't remember who did it but it sounds about like a Maurice Jarre or John Barry score imitation.  The rich, good-looking couple is happily reunited and loves each other boundlessly only after the homewrecker is dead, usually with a lot of blood-spilling.  Hey, it worked for FATAL ATTRACTION.  Just make the woman the one to have an affair this time around.  The homewrecker even has a New York studio apartment just like the homewrecker in FATAL ATTRACTION.  I thought this movie would never end.  Things start to look up after gallons of blood are spilled from someone who must not have skin any thicker than toilet tissue.  My theory is that he must have been on blood-thinning medication since his head flows like a busted water main.  A couple of taps to the noggin and he's pretty much room temperature and best of all, he just stands there and lets it happen.  I admire someone who faces his mortality without question.  He could have been a suicide bomber since he doesn't even flinch when someone tries to kill him.  Finally, it looks like the movie will get interesting but fear not, unlike the reasonably exciting climax to FATAL ATTRACTION, this film pretty much just stops as if the filmmakers couldn't think of a good way to end this so they ended it in a really lame way.  I was really rooting for them by the end too.  I mean, they're young, they're in love, they're rich and they kill people.  They're the modern day equivalent to Ward and June Cleaver except Ward and June don't kill people.  Maybe they are planning a sequel...UNFAITHFUL 2 RETURN OF THE HOMICIDAL, RICH, GOOD-LOOKING COUPLE.  UNFAITHFUL?  A more descriptive title would either be UNWATCHABLE or FATAL ATTRACTION 2.

Its a somber look at a man so traumatized by heart breaking loss and scarred by the world around him that he has turned into a bitter cold shell. It could be viewed as a scathing political\/social commentary. And finaly its merely a darkly poetic film about the struggle of existence.First off the acting was superb. A lot of people at first glance might right this off as another stupid action movie. My friends that would be a travesty. EVERYONE involved, from Max, to the gyro captain, to the kid, to the evil gang, to the Leader of the Oil clan gives a believable wonderful performance. Even the mohawked biker bad guy does a great job despite never really uttering a sensible word. Its all about facial expressions and conveyance of emotion in The Road Warrior. A fine job by everyone envolved. Much better than Mad Max and the eventual Beyond Thunderdome.The music was simply the BEST I've ever heard for an action movie. Period. Moody, fitting, exhilirating. For every situation in the film, the music was like a character in itself.  Especially the opening and final closing seconds of the movie. I got goosebumps.

Incredible camera work to boot.The story was simple and to the point. In this case it was a good thing. Forget movies like XXX or The Scorpion King or any other ambiguous action yarn. The simple subtleness of The Road Warrior is what made the action even more heart racing.Well what else can I say? The best of the Mad Max trilogy without doubt, and in my opinion the best action movie ever made. You owe it to yourself to see this movie.

It could have been great, but some aspects of it, degrade it- The story is good, but it lacks 'feeling', the feeling that, Star Wars, ESB and Return of the Jedi have, you care more for the story and characters, in these new Star Wars films you simply give a damn.- The casting for the Anakin character was not the best, the actor Hayden Christensen performs his acting like he is in a N'Sync or Westlife video! He even looks like a member of those terrible groups. I still cannot see with the bad acting he did, that his Anakin character and Darth Vader are the same person.- The excesive computarized FX, in some parts they are very good, but in much others they simply don`t look real.

Ray and the much younger Gerry start to fall for each other as they work causing splits and disharmony within the crew.I vaguely remember hearing reviews of this film when it was released but it didn't do well and was hardly in the cinemas for a week before it vanished.  It popped up recently on TV and I gave it a go despite not hearing much good about it.  It is actually not that bad but it is a long way short of The Full Monty.The film seems to want to have some sort of gritty social dimension about it  but this is no Ken Loach film and it doesn't come off.  I didn't get any wider point about the class of these men that ran through the story.  The serious side to the work that comes in later is not as strong as it needs to be and didn't carry enough weight.  The main thing here is the confused romance between Ray and Gerry that didn't quite come off.  The reasons for the difficulties in the relationship are not totally clear and the way it goes is not convincing, rather a bit dull and pedestrian.  It has it's moments of potential beauty such as the cooling tower scene and tender moments between the pair, but these don't come off as well as they should.I found this to be partly the fault of the cast.   Postlethwaite is a reasonably good actor and Griffiths can be very good (check out HBO's 6ft Under) but they lack a real sense of chemistry that was needed to be realistic.  The crew are all pretty good despite having not well formed characters.  Postlethwaite needed to be stronger but he is a little lo-key when really he should have commanded the screen more, although his tact does work in the quiet moments.The direction is good and Miller seems to like the wide Northern landscapes with all his swirling helicopter shots and fancy shots through the pylon structures.  Add to this the haunting score and the film has a sort of other-worldly feel to it that the material can make good on.  Maybe I just didn't get it and others may find this to be very touching, however I must admit that I never got emotionally involved in any of it and it left me feeling a bit dry more than anything else.

Up to a point, it's a more than adequate thriller. A corrupt Atlantic City cop (Nicholas Cage) investigates the assassination of a respected politician at a boxing match. The more he looks, the more obvious it is that there was a conspiracy and cover-up. But who is behind it? And for what purpose? His only clue is a mysterious woman in white. His best friend is a naval officer (Gary Sinise) who is the only one he can trust (or can he?). The storyline is--quite frankly--pretty standard. There have been numerous other books and films dealing with government conspiracies and rouge members of the military and intelligence communities. Nothing special here. But the director's visual style makes it interesting--Brian DePalma doesn't let us down in this area. He employs some excellent camerawork to draw us into the story. The film begins with an unbroken, fifteen-minute shot that even its detractors have praised. The director made use of splitscreen in a memorable way when he did Dressed to Kill, and he puts it to good use here; along with flashbacks, multiple perspectives are shown, and at least one of them is unreliable (but who?)Alas, after a while, it runs out of steam. I can determine with certainty that neither DePalma or screenwriter David Koepp could decide on an appropriate ending for the story. The climax is completely strained and contrived, leaving us unsatisfied with the film as a whole. Also, much of the moral ambiguity is defused. When the film opens, we see a protagonist who is corrupt and opportunistic, having accepted many bribes in the past. However, by the time the movie ends, what was once drawn in shades of gray is polarized between bright white and pitch black. It's still watchable, but it makes you think, is that it? After the setup, it is not unreasonable to expect more, especially from the talent involved.Nicholas Cage is fun to watch, though he really overdoes it at first, threatening to turn his character into a cartoon. Later, though, he settles down and gets serious. Gary Sinise is adequate, but I never really found his character particularly interesting. The supporting performances are solid. John Heard plays an opportunistic reporter, Stan Shaw a prizefighter who has been manipulated by the conspirators. Likewise, Carla Gugino is good as the mystery woman whose motives (and loyalties) are not immediately revealed. Luis Guzmán has a bit part as a hood.

One is that, like Mississippi Burning, it gives us white men as heroes.  But that's not particularly bothersome.  African-Americans in the South and elsewhere provided most of the leadership in the civil rights movement, and they did almost all the bleeding, but as been argued insistently political and social power has traditionally been vested in whites.  So it's kind of interesting when an agent of social change comes from the very class that is liable to have to give up some of its power if that change occurs.  We want our share of the pie is a perfectly reasonable argument.  A reply like, Here, take some of ours, draws attention to itself.The movie itself isn't badly done.  Events follow one another logically.  We get to know the characters a little bit.  The score isn't overdone, though it's perfunctory.  But it's as if the film were a six pack with all the cans there but without the plastic thing that holds them all in place.  Like many recent works from Rob Reiner, James Bridges, and Ron Howard, it leaves a viewer feeling good but also sensing opportunities that have been lost somewhere. The problems aren't with the acting.  Alec Baldwin is such an unpretentious guy, for a leading man, that it's hard not to like him whatever he appears in.  (On a TV talk show he once made fun of himself by describing how his high school classmates on Long Island humiliated him and called him Baldy.)  He may never give a bravura performance but he doesn't fail to deliver the goods.  The other cast members are at least adequate with the exception of James Woods, who rises distinctly above adequacy.  Yes, it's a variation of his usual cocky and dominating character, but here he gives it a twist that smacks of red eye gravy, to such an extent that at time we can believe this is Byron de la Beckwith being arrogant, not just James Woods.  Whoopy Goldberg is stiff.  And therein lies a large part of the problem.The characters inhabit, at best, a kind of two-dimensional flatland.  Baldwin is driven by a desire to shake himself and his community of the past and has problems at home.  Goldberg is proud and suspicious of whites.  Woods has only one dimension to play with.  The script and the direction doesn't really give anyone a chance to do much more than enact the simplest of character traits.  Goldberg suffers most.  Her widow speaks in starchy tones -- Perhaps, she says, when all the other characters are saying, Maybe.  Good afternoon, Gentlemen.  Her expression hardly wavers from one scene to the next.  And her finally turning over the transcripts of the first trial to Baldwin is a no-brainer.  It's presented to us as a triumph for her and for the story and for justice.  She finally overcame her suspicion of Baldwin, see.  But nothing is made of the fact that for the first ninety percent of the film's time she is torpedoing the second trial by holding the documents back.  (Why didn't she Xerox them and give them a copy?)  Her saintly status is an assumption made by the director, the writers, and the actress.  What a burden it must be to represent an entire race of people and be plugged into a role that must radiate sanctity. Still, it's a feel-good movie and it's usually nice to feel good.  The injustices of the past can never be rectified but sometimes corrective adjustments can be made in our current social worlds.  And it still takes guts to take a position like DeLaughter and Morris Dies do in this film, even if the film itself goes down as smoothly at Metamucil.  I wonder how many people watching this movie find this all to be ancient history -- the segregation, the intolerance, the hatred.  It must be rather like watching the corrupt and perverted politicians in Gladiator.  Did people really act that way?  Yup.  They did.  And it's not ancient history either.  I was refused service in restaurants in three locations in the South during the 1960s because of my accent, a beard, and because a companion was wearing a sweatshirt with the name of a Northern college on it.  (I'm guessing at the reasons because no one ever handed us a note beginning, These are the reasons you are being politely ignored.)There are times when I think of how far the South has come from such traditions -- and in such a relatively short time -- that I believe Southern whites should be congratulated for having come around, not without resistance and not without violence, but without guerilla warfare anyway.  There are certain lifestyles that we can now rejoice are all gone with the wind.  Not a bad movie.  It's a fascinating story and I wish it had been done better.

There are certain lifestyles that we can now rejoice are all gone with the wind.  Not a bad movie.  It's a fascinating story and I wish it had been done better.   ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"2 February 2003","score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  SPOILERS.The movie has been criticized for a number of reasons.  One is that, like Mississippi Burning, it gives us white men as heroes.  But that's not particularly bothersome.  African-Americans in the South and elsewhere provided most of the leadership in the civil rights movement, and they did almost all the bleeding, but as been argued insistently political and social power has traditionally been vested in whites.  So it's kind of interesting when an agent of social change comes from the very class that is liable to have to give up some of its power if that change occurs.  We want our share of the pie is a perfectly reasonable argument.  A reply like, Here, take some of ours, draws attention to itself.The movie itself isn't badly done.  Events follow one another logically.  We get to know the characters a little bit.  The score isn't overdone, though it's perfunctory.  But it's as if the film were a six pack with all the cans there but without the plastic thing that holds them all in place.  Like many recent works from Rob Reiner, James Bridges, and Ron Howard, it leaves a viewer feeling good but also sensing opportunities that have been lost somewhere. The problems aren't with the acting.  Alec Baldwin is such an unpretentious guy, for a leading man, that it's hard not to like him whatever he appears in.  (On a TV talk show he once made fun of himself by describing how his high school classmates on Long Island humiliated him and called him Baldy.)  He may never give a bravura performance but he doesn't fail to deliver the goods.  The other cast members are at least adequate with the exception of James Woods, who rises distinctly above adequacy.  Yes, it's a variation of his usual cocky and dominating character, but here he gives it a twist that smacks of red eye gravy, to such an extent that at time we can believe this is Byron de la Beckwith being arrogant, not just James Woods.  Whoopy Goldberg is stiff.  And therein lies a large part of the problem.The characters inhabit, at best, a kind of two-dimensional flatland.  Baldwin is driven by a desire to shake himself and his community of the past and has problems at home.  Goldberg is proud and suspicious of whites.  Woods has only one dimension to play with.  The script and the direction doesn't really give anyone a chance to do much more than enact the simplest of character traits.  Goldberg suffers most.  Her widow speaks in starchy tones -- Perhaps, she says, when all the other characters are saying, Maybe.  Good afternoon, Gentlemen.  Her expression hardly wavers from one scene to the next.  And her finally turning over the transcripts of the first trial to Baldwin is a no-brainer.  It's presented to us as a triumph for her and for the story and for justice.  She finally overcame her suspicion of Baldwin, see.  But nothing is made of the fact that for the first ninety percent of the film's time she is torpedoing the second trial by holding the documents back.  (Why didn't she Xerox them and give them a copy?)  Her saintly status is an assumption made by the director, the writers, and the actress.  What a burden it must be to represent an entire race of people and be plugged into a role that must radiate sanctity. Still, it's a feel-good movie and it's usually nice to feel good.  The injustices of the past can never be rectified but sometimes corrective adjustments can be made in our current social worlds.  And it still takes guts to take a position like DeLaughter and Morris Dies do in this film, even if the film itself goes down as smoothly at Metamucil.

We couldn't understand all the fuss and high user ratings. I liked Unbreakable much more, and even The Sixth Sense.  For me, the extras on the Signs DVD are much more interesting than the film itself, a fairly simple alien story that moves along very deliberately. But the extras give a superb glimpse into Night's film-making process, how he writes, how he directs, the building of the farm set in an experimental corn field, and how the CGI alien was done. However, there's a bit much mutual admiration comments at times by the actors and crew. And Night's comment, regarding design of various trailers to advertise Signs, We're going to show you one of the best movies ever seen, gives us an insight into the perhaps inflated view Night has of his own work.some SPOILERS follow - don't read further if you haven't seen Signs yet, unless you don't mind spoiling some of the surprise.A key theme running through Signs and uttered more than once is, Is it possible that there are no coincidences? It is said at the end, by Gibson's character, when the young boy is spared the alien's poisonous gas because his lungs are temporarily incapacitated from his asthma. We are shown a drawing in a book of aliens where the house looks exactly like the one in this movie. The film gets its title from crop signs, made by alien beings as directions for other aliens to follow them, but also has the meaning of Gibson's character, an Episcopal priest, to get a sign from God regarding his faith, lost when his wife was killed by a car. It turns out that the aliens here are not kind aliens, they want something which is never directly revealed.What did I not like about this movie? I find the dialog unbelievable much of the time. Also, Night wanted to inject humor into the script, which he did, but for me it did ring true in relation to what was happening on-screen. For example, near the end when the alien was in the attic, his brother got on a chair and was holding the attic door shut by extending his arms to the door, as the alien tried to push it open. He says, This is only a temporary solution. Gibson asks, How temporary and the answer is About 22 more seconds.  I don't really believe this is the dialog two adult brothers would have during a life-threatening situation, unles you are simply making a broad comedy. Signs is not a broad comedy, it examines what could happen if crop signs really were made by dangerous aliens, and also how a fallen away priest might regain his love for God. I believe Night tried too hard in filming Signs to come up with some grand moments. There is no doubt he is strongly influenced by great directors like Hitchcock, and artists like Norman Rockwell, because he mentions these in the DVD extras. However it seems that he tries too hard to make emotional things happen instead of letting them simply be a result of really good directing and acting of a really good script.  I believe he failed for the most part in Signs when he tried to create these grand moments. And for me, the film failed to create the mood of terror at any time.Night takes much care to set up the premise of crop signs made by aliens, and the idea that they are dangerous, maybe even threatening the very existence of life as we know it on Earth. But he gets rid of that threat with one simple statement over the news, In the middle east using an ancient method the aliens have been chased away. No other details are available.  As I watched the film I thought, What the heck is that? Sure seems like a giant cop-out in the story line. It was as if he didn't know how to handle this grand premise he had created, so he just invented some quick resolution.In summary, I like Night and his method of making films. I especially like Unbreakable with its good vs evil theme residing in the two main characters. I own the DVD and watch it periodically, I admire how well it was done. While I enjoyed Signs I don't think it rises above average, and certainly not in the category of the better films I have seen over the past few years. Night is still a very young film maker and I look forward to what he may offer in the future. However, for him to continue his success I believe he needs to move away from his boyish fascination with himself, which I think dilutes his ideas, and re-focus on what he does best, create fascinating new themes for films.
