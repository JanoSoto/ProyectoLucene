In this love triangle with a `twist,' Ben Stiller, Edward Norton and Jenna Elfman portray a trio of best friends who grew up together on the streets of New York City, but who were separated in adolescence when Anna moved away with her family to California.  The unique aspect of this particular triumvirate is that, while Anna has been away on the west coast forging a lucrative career in business for herself, Brian has become a priest and Jake has become a rabbi.  Now all three are in their '30 and Anna has decided to pay her `buddies' a visit &#150; a move that sets the story up for all the interpersonal and emotional complications that are practically de rigueur for a `Jules and Jim' scenario of this sort. Given the rather incredible nature of the premise, `Keeping the Faith' still manages to generate some interest with the uniqueness of its religious context.   Like most American movies that attempt to deal with issues of spirituality and religion, `Keeping the Faith' spends most of its time batting away at the edges of the topic rather than getting right in there and really opening up the subject for us.  Indeed, very few commercial American films are even willing to tackle or explore in any great depth the role that religion and spirituality play in the lives of people, so we should at least give `Keeping the Faith' credit for trying. Of course, much of the tension in the film is supposed to be generated by the fact that one point of this triangle (the priest, Brian) has pulled himself out of the equation &#150; or has he?  But if the truth be told, the love triangle, which takes center stage in the film, is actually far less interesting than the issues of faith, of tradition vs. relevance, of spiritual commitment on the part of both clergy and laypeople that the film at least sporadically addresses.  Almost inevitably, with a film this lightweight in tone, `Keeping the Faith' seems from time to time to be afflicted with a severe case of the `cutes,' particularly when it succumbs to the `golly gee, people of the cloth are just regular folk like the rest of us' syndrome that seems somehow unavoidable in films like this.  Thus, despite their clerical status, Jake and Brian cuss, drink alcohol, play basketball, sing karaoke etc. just to show us what regular guys they are.  We've seen this sort of religious iconoclasm used for comic effect so many times before that it has long since lost the ability to amuse.Where the film does excel, though, is in its exploration of the issue (faced by many churches and synagogues, no doubt) of whether tradition alone can sustain a viable congregation or whether unorthodox methods may be needed to reach and retain a more `entertainment-oriented' generation of worshippers.  Many times in the film, I found myself wishing that the story would concentrate less on the rigmarole surrounding the love triangle itself and more on issues like these.  However, even within the confines of the romantic nature of the story, the filmmakers do manage to touch, if only superficially, on the issues of Catholic priest celibacy and interfaith marriages.  Stiller, Norton and Elfman give generally naturalistic performances, though none of them are forced to stretch their talents too much in these roles.   Interestingly, famed director Milos Forman shows up as a wise old priest who sets Brian straight on the thorny issue of celibacy.  `Keeping The Faith' probably would have been a better film had it dealt with the same issues in a less frivolous and trivial context than is provided for them here.  Still, we should, I suppose, be thankful that any American film is willing to acknowledge religion and spirituality as part of our lives at all.  `Keeping the Faith' is, therefore, well worth checking out.

Although the story uses some cliches, it uses them well, and so it's not really a problem. The three main characters (Duchovny, Jones, and Scott) are fairly typical underdog hero types. However they are all very funny, and some of the comedy is far better that a lot of recent comedies. Going in, you're going to have a pretty good idea how it ends, of course, it's getting to that ending that makes this movie good. For instance, you know that our heroes will come up with some ingenious method to stop the aliens, but in Evolution, they come up with an idea (which I won't spoil) that is also very funny. The script for Evolution is far better than many recent comedies. There are quite a few witty conversations between the characters that go beyond the typical slapstick, shock-oriented humor that has become popular of late. That said, the film does occasionally lapse into some gross-out humor (like an extended fart gag near the end), but fortunately there's not too much of it, and there's enough of the more intelligent comedy to make up for it.The acting in Evolution was also quite good. David Duchovny proves that he can do comedy, and in a way, almost mocks his X-Files character in this movie. He deadpans many of his lines, but his timing is good, and so this works for great comedic effect, instead of being boring. I was especially impressed with Orlando Jones, who was not only very funny, but proved that he could be serious at times. Jones actually had some of the lines that made me laugh the most. He's one of the few comedians who's acting skills constantly impress me. Seann William Scott is pretty good as well, though he does play basically play the same character he's played in many of his films. He seems like he could be a pretty good actor, I'd love to see him try something different. Julianne Moore is, of course, a very talented actress, and brings as much to her role as she can. Her character is, however, the least developed of the four, and so she doesn't really shine here, but she at least manages to keep her character from seeming too one dimensional.Overall, I enjoyed Evolution. It's not perfect; there's a few plot holes and a few of the jokes misfire. Most of them, however, do not, and the movie manages to become an entertaining, well-acted, summer comedy. And even if you DON'T like the movie, you'll still love the special effects.

Boy, what a great spoof this is!  Lone Starr (Bill Pullman) is really good in this as the hero of the picture.  Lone Starr...notice the first two letters of each?  Remind you of Luke Skywalker?  Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) is really excellent in the film also.  She is an absolute stuck-up brat, but begins to fall for Lone Starr.  Barf (John Candy) is a mog, half-human, half-dog in the movie.  He adds some great comedy in many of the scenes.  Joan Rivers plays the voice of the robot, Dot Matrix.  Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis) is unbelievably funny with the deep voice with the mask on and the light-nerd voice with it off!  But my favorite has to be Mel Brooks...he was President Skroob (Get it?) and Yogurt.The plot may be incredibly full of holes and very very silly but you must take into account that this is a spoof comedy.  It's not all supposed to make sense, if it did then it wouldn't be as funny!There are just so many funny moments in the movie.  I remember discussing the film several times in grade school, laughing at the Spaceball salute, the whole ludicrous speed thing, and the deep\/light voice Rick Moranis did!I highly suggest that you purchase this on DVD.

And after seeing it a couple hours ago, I am not at all disappointed.  It's been awhile since I've seen a truly enjoyable, mature action movie.  With the slew of PG-13 action movies of recent years, it's refreshing to see one that at least acknowledges that many intense situations do involve language, sex, and mixed character reactions - it wasn't just another black and white, good and bad movie where the good guy does only good things and the bad guy has only evil intentions.  The good guy (Jackman) didn't always do the right thing, and the bad guy (Travolta) could hardly be accused of sinister motives.The film starts off with a bang ... literally.  A big-time action sequence to get out attention, then a flashback to show how the climax of the film came to pass.  The out-of-order editing was actually effective and interesting, rather than seeming like yet another failed attempt to mimic Pulp Fiction and those other movies that brought attention to the idea of showing a film out of chronological order.Jackman was great as computer hacker Stanley Jobson, devoted father who just happened to get brought down for computer-related felonies after hacking into and making public an FBI e-mail surveillance operation.  Forbidden to even touch a computer for the rest of his days, he is lured back into the life by Travolta, who offers him $100,000 just to meet him (and take an interesting version of an initiation).  Jackman is quickly becoming Hollywood A-list material, and with his performance in Swordfish, it's easy to see why.  He can keep up with the smooth-talking, fast-moving Travolta as well as show enough emotion to make him seem like a real person and not just a run-of-the-mill action hero.The plot of the film is fantastic.  It's not just a typical heist film, or action plot where the hero has to save the hostages, blowing the hell out of the bad guys in the process.  The plot is complex, interwoven, and has a point.  The plot was crucial to keeping interest during the slow parts of the film.  Starting out with an action sequence carries the danger of losing audience interest if not followed up by more and more action.  Thankfully, the plot manages to retain interest during those points in the film where things aren't exploding and buses aren't flying through metropolitan airspace, suspended from a heavy loading chopper.The best part about this film was the interractions between the characters. Stanley is a smart guy, and Gabriel's smarter.  Just when Stanley (and the audience) thinks they have Gabriel in a tight spot, he'll surprise everyone with some improvised ingenuity.  There are so many films in the action genre that result to dumbing down the smart villains, just so the hero of the story will look good when he comes up with a relatively weak solution to the complex plot.  The villains often slip up or make some kind of fatal faux pas in judgment that allows the hero to triumph.  There's none of that here. The hero and villain are both smart, and both stay that way until the very end.This is a great summer movie.  See it.  See it twice or three times, even. If you're looking for high art or something that really speaks to you and changes the way you see the world, don't see it.  But if you want to see a movie for the sake of entertainment and having a good time, Swordfish is the movie to go to.

It lacks the fast pace and action packed, horse-chasing, bullet-riddled scenes that encompass most westerns of the time. Most of the cliches, both in dialogue and scene, aren't apparent. And most of all it examines the interplay between characters, each character had character...no one-dimensional cowboys and outlaws here.The dialogue is clever and often witty, the plot isn't predictable or full of holes, and most of all there isn't a proud, evil-fighting cowboy hero. In fact, the world is all grey, no black and white.

The story is like a beefed-up remake of the Nausicaa movie (sans flying) and Shuna's Journey (sans flying saucer-like god machine).  The characters are complex, with no one acting out of evil (though there are scenes of violence that culminated out of anger, usually Ashitaka's).The best part, though, is when San kisses the food into Ashitaka's mouth, which works for me on two levels.  First, this is the first real act of kindness anyone has directed towards Ashitaka since his own sister broke the ancient customs to give him her jeweled dagger. Secondly, the Japanese are a really restrained society, and, supposedly, traditional parents won't kiss or embrace in public or even in front of their children (trivia the concept of kissing was imported to Japan by Dutch missionaries (don't ask me why they showed them) in the 1500's--before that, the Japanese did not kiss).I have only two complaints about Mononoke Hime, one major and one minor. The minor one is that, as with kissing, gunpowder (and by proxy guns) was introduced to Japan by European travelers (which shows just how isolated a culture Japan was at the time), not by the Chinese.

Meanwhile he inadvertently gets his future mother interested in him, jeopardizing the future relationship of his parents. The old newspaper accounts of the lightning strike of the clock tower is used as a source of energy to get Marty back home. His fight with Biff in 1955 has altered history and his 1985 family is apparently much better off as a result.#2 hinges on Biff inadvertently getting a copy of an almanac for future events and he dishonestly uses future sports results to gain fortune and power, and drastically change the future. Marty and Doc have to retrieve the almanac before Biff uses it, to restore history to its proper order. It ends in a way that sets up the #3 sequel.In #3 Marty gets a Western Union letter that Doc Brown had actually written in 1885 and requested delivery at the specific time in the future. Doc has ended up in 1885, is content, and insists that Marty not try to interfere. However, Marty discovers a tombstone and historical account of Doc being shot in the back over an $80 issue.
