Redford showed himself too much and the movie could have been edited down to about half its length.  This one doesn't have Redford in it, so he does a pretty good job of keeping the pace moving.  Matt Damon is a great actor, but only good here. As an avid golfer I would have to say his swing is fairly flawed and the way he leaves his hips out means there is absolutely no way he could hit a golf ball 300 yards.  However, his swing was perfect for the scenes where he was shanking the ball left and right. So I will give him a C grade on the golfing portion of his acting.  Damon pulled off everything thing else with an A-. He was very good and had great chemistry with Charlize Theron.  Her accent was off a bit, but not bad for someone from South Africa. Charlize gets a B.Will Smith was a natural in his role and the highlight of the movie.  Every moment he spent on the screen was perfect. A+ for Will.Redford's direction was pretty good, but there were a few gaffes which are worth mentioning.  Golf balls from the 20's did not have dimples. The close-ups of the balls showed 90's style golfs balls. This was quite lame. They were not made from polymers which made dimples possible until the late 40's.  The balls were rubber on the outside and they would not have flown 300 yards if King Kong were hitting them with a wooden shafted club. These technical glitches can be put aside because this movie wasn't really about golf they say.  Well I say don't put golf in the story if you aren't going to do it right.  Redford gets a B-.

He prefers to entertain his audience of college students and teenagers with a cornucopia of absurdities and toilet jokes.  Little Nicky is much the same, but with two major differences.There is a heavy dependance on special effects in this film.  Nicky, as the Devil's son, obviously resides in Hell and Sandler's version of Hell is pretty impressive looking, at least in wide, panoramic shots of the geography.  The special effects are put to good use here, but it isn't very scary.  Hell looks like a fine place to live, and as the Devil,   Harvey Keitel seriously downplays both the Devil's evil side and his funny side, doing little to add to the film.  There is little to be scared of in this Hell. Except for the occassional gross-out gag.Nicky goes to Earth to prevent his brothers, the two most evil characters, from corrupting the souls on earth and thereby, in a convuluted and pointless plot, killing Nicky's beloved father.  While on earth, Nicky is aided by a talking bulldog, a couple of metalheads looking for some cred, and a shy but sweet girl played by Patricia Arquette.Sandler always has a love story in his films, but never has one been so juvenile.  Nicky is little more than a shy teenager, new to earth and awkward in expressing himself, and the scenes where he falls for Arquette are ineffective and cloyingly sensitive.  Hearing the Devil's son talking about butterflies in his stomach, in a film that features a character sprouting breasts on his head, struck me as an odd juxtaposition.  10 year olds will love some of the jokes and they might even enjoy the cheesy romance, G-rated as it is, but would you want your 10 year-old going to a movie that features an enormous bird attempting to copulate with Jon Lovitz?Sandler needs to choose an audience, this movie is splintered down the middle as he attempts to appeal to 5th graders with his goofiness and to college kids with his scatalogical side.  It never reaches any level of cohesiveness, though it remains entertaining in fits and starts.  Between the special effects, the sap and the raunch, the movie gets lost in the mix. Next time, Sandler should choose one audience and ride it all the way through.

It never reaches any level of cohesiveness, though it remains entertaining in fits and starts.  Between the special effects, the sap and the raunch, the movie gets lost in the mix.

","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"20 November 2000","score":"","review":"  We all know by this point that Adam Sandler is not one to go for high-brow humor.  He prefers to entertain his audience of college students and teenagers with a cornucopia of absurdities and toilet jokes.  Little Nicky is much the same, but with two major differences.There is a heavy dependance on special effects in this film.  Nicky, as the Devil's son, obviously resides in Hell and Sandler's version of Hell is pretty impressive looking, at least in wide, panoramic shots of the geography.  The special effects are put to good use here, but it isn't very scary.  Hell looks like a fine place to live, and as the Devil,   Harvey Keitel seriously downplays both the Devil's evil side and his funny side, doing little to add to the film.  There is little to be scared of in this Hell. Except for the occassional gross-out gag.Nicky goes to Earth to prevent his brothers, the two most evil characters, from corrupting the souls on earth and thereby, in a convuluted and pointless plot, killing Nicky's beloved father.

I wanted to see this movie, but went in unenthusiastically, due to the poor advertising campaign.  The promotion surrounding this film made it look like it was about a killer robot, who turns on the crew, but this turned out to be only a small part of the story.  I also thought that the astronauts' spacesuits looked more retro (ie, Alien) than futuristic. However, RP turned out to have it's share of positives, and I enjoyed it much more than I expected.Mars is astoundingly convincing in this film.  It looks exactly like the pictures sent here from the Sojourner back in 1997, and the director thankfully takes his time showing us the caverns, rocks, and landscapes of the planet, much more so than 2000's earlier Mars-movie, Mission to Mars. It is very believable--if we didn't know better we'd think that the movie was shot there.  The colors and tint from the surrounding atmosphere are also quite accurately portrayed, according to what we know, of course. People might complain that there isn't much characterization in this movie, since the characters have standard motives and backgrounds.  But at least they have different and believable personalities, accompanied by decent performances.  This is especially true of Val Kilmer and the always reliable Tom Sizemore.SPOILER WARNING;SKIP THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!I was at first disappointed when the astronauts removed their helmets, and found the air breathable, as a result of the algae growing portion of the terraforming process.  Terraforming is a fascinating and possible concept that is extremely complicated.  It would probably take hundreds of years at the least to even get it started.  And even if there was oxygen on Mars, it would be too thin for humans to breathe.  The removal of space helmets also poses another serious danger--Mars' insubstantial ozone layer.  Standing on the surface of Mars, an unprotected human would freeze to death at the same time his blood boiled, or something to that effect.  It sure wouldn't be pretty (although it probably wouldn't be TOTAL RECALL either.)  However, I soon forgot about this falsity as the plot progressed, and the characters met the living inhabitants of the planet--insect-like animals, creatively and believably constructed.  They looked real, and seemed to fit our description of the organisms that could possibly live on Mars.The presence of some true science in Red Planet at least excuses some of the film's fictional liberties--scientific facts aren't altogether blatantly disregarded and ignored here.  They are disguised and hidden when they interfere with the film's drama.  The film does, for example acknowledge the length of time the voyage to Mars would take, and (humorously) the effect of Mars' low gravity on human visitors (something that M2M again failed to do.)Red Planet is interesting and entertaining, even if it isn't the cosmic action film that some may have hoped for, or avoided because it apparently wasn't.
