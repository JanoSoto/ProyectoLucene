While clearing a Vampire nest out Crow is disappointed that they didn't find the Master Vampire, while celebrating their kills the Vampire Master pays them a visit & kills the entire team save for Crow, his second in command Anthony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin) & a prostitute named Katrina (Sheryl Lee) whom he bites. Knowing that any Vampire victim has a telepathic link with it's Master Crow decides to use Katrina to get to him, upon further investigation it turns out that the Vampire Master in this case is Jan Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), the very first Vampire ever who is now on a mission to find the Brezier Cross which will let him & his kind walk in sunlight...Directed & scored by John Carpenter this film was apparently originally slated to be directed by Russell Mulcahy & star Dolph Lundgren! Thank God that never came to pass, also just before production began the studio cut the budget by two thirds, so instead of an eighty million dollar flick Carpenter had to rework it for a twenty million dollar budget. Anyway, the script by Don Jakoby was based on the novel 'Vampire$' by John Steakley (I have never read the novel but according to Steakley in interviews the finished film contains much of his books dialogue but none of his books plot) & is an entertaining action horror film that isn't up there with Carpenter's best it's one of his better efforts from more recent years. The character's are a mixed bag, the intense Crow played by the always watchable James Woods is a great character & you end up liking the guy but his second in command Montoya is very unlikable while Katrina the prostitute is given next to no development & it doesn't feel right when the two fall in love at the end, nothing that has happened in the film to that point indicates why the two would fall in love & it just doesn't work. Also the main Vampire villain is given very little to do, apart from two lines of dialogue & lots of dark Gothic posturing he might as well not be there. At over 100 minutes Vampires is quite a long film but it doesn't feel like it, it moves along at a good pace, it can be a bit repetitive at times but it does provide good solid gory horror themed entertainment. The twists are a little easy to predict, there's the clichéd 'forget what you've seen in the movies' type speech in regards to Vampires (every modern Vampire flick has to have one) & while it's certainly good it's not a film which will linger that long in the memory.Director Carpenter needed a hit after his previous films Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1992), In the Mouth of Madness (1995), Village of the Damned (1995) & Escape from L.A. (1996) all flopped at the US box office & as such he goes back to basics with Vampires, it has a fairly straight forward story, plenty of action & gore as well as a nice modern clean look about it. There's a fair amount of style here, the opening scene when all the Vampire slayers get ready & strap on all their gear complete with huge weapons & sunglasses is all about cool macho posturing. I wouldn't say it's particularly scary but it does deliver on the gore front, from slashed throats to decapitated heads to burning Vampires to someone being vertically sliced in half & separating down the middle.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 Vampires is well made with glossy big budget Hollywood production values, the special effects are all of the real on set rubber & latex variety rather than CGI which is pleasing. Actually filmed in New Mexico. The acting is good & James Woods is just a great actor & is in top form here.Vampires is a good solid big budget Hollywood horror film with plenty of gore, special effects & action. While it's not classic Carpenter since he has made better films it's right up there with his best. Well worth a watch. Followed by two sequels, Vampires Los Muertos (2002) with Jon Bon Jovi & Vampires The Turning (2005) without Jon Bon Jovi.

Basically Jack Crow (James Woods) is a vampire slayer on the Vatican payroll, and accompanied by others, including Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), he is obviously on the lookout for the vampires, but the only things that can kill them are stakes in the heart and sunlight, forget garlic, crosses\/the crucifix and the bible, they don't help. The big threat of the film is mastermind vampire Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) who needs a black cross or something to be able to walk in sunlight from then on. Also starring Sheryl Lee as Katrina, Maximilian Schell as Cardinal Alba, Tim Guinee as Father Adam Guiteau, Boone Junior as Catlin Mark and Gregory Sierra as Father Giovanni. The main reason to see this film form me, besides a good performance (with little dialogue) by Woods, is the gore, some good amounts. Worth watching!
