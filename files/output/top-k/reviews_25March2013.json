It had twice the budget, it got nominated for 11 Oscars like the original and it won twice the Oscars with 6 wins Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro), Best Art Direction - Set Decoration (Dean Travoularis, Angelo P. Graham), Best Music, Original Dramatic Score (Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola), Best Adapted Screenplay (Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo), Best Director (Francis Ford Coppola) and Best Picture (Francis Ford Coppola, Gray Frederickson and Fred Roos). The movie didn't bring in as much money as the original, though. Many people see this as better than the original, and even the best movie of all time. For the time being, I actually prefer this movie over the original. Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Gazale and Diane Keaton returned to star, and new actors were brought in, including Michael V. Gazzo and Lee Strassberg.The Godfather Part 2 would carry on the legacy of perfection that The Godfather presented to the world. One of the reasons being is the second spectacular screenplay by Coppola and Puzo! The movie is straightforward, and even though it's a more complicated plot than the first, it's not THAT hard to follow. Many iconic lines are introduced once again, and the idea of making this movie a prequel as well of a follow-up seems unique. Al Pacino delivers an even more complex and disturbed performance as the now chilling and psychotic Michael Corleone. The Michael Corleone in the original movie was relaxed and could act human, whereas he (in this movie) coldly kills anyone, and I repeat, ANYONE who stands in his way. Pacinos performance is believable all the way, and the relaxed attitude he expresses on-screen, echoes back to the permanently relaxed Michael we saw in the original. He can talk almost robotic and give a cold stare to a man, and explode with rage in the next second, and Pacino sells it. Pacino delivered one of the greatest, if not the greatest villainous performance of all time, and possibly THE greatest performance of all time. Robert De Niro is one of the other stars in the movie! He plays the part of the young Vito Corleone with finesse and a nice calmness, all the while maintaining the virtues that made Brandos's first performance so special. His performance stands as one of the best supporting ones, and he isn't even my favorite supporting character in the movie. Michael V. Gazzo's aging and hot-headed Frankie Pentangeli is a joy to watch on-screen, although his performance is significantly weaker when compared to some of the other performances in this movie. Lee Strassberg delivers yet another spectacular and moving performance as the long-time gangster Hyman Roth. But the one supporting performance that really shined for me (more than in the original), John Gazale as the brother Fredo Corleone. His performance was delicately layered and moving all the way, and by the end of the film I felt such pity for the guy. Shoulda' been nominated for an Oscar.The musical score in this movie is very much the same, and therefore as brilliant and as memorable as the first. The cinematography, the sound and the set decoration are spectacular, and makes the movie feel more epic.I prefer this movie to the original for a number of reasons For what seemed to be an impossible goal to make the movie better than the first for some, for the stronger characters, the stronger performances, the epic feel to it, the perfection carried on, the more complex plot and the magnificent ending. This movie must never be deemed a sequel! It carries on the perfection of the first already perfect movie.

Woody and the gang are back in one of the best sequels ever made Pixar's Toy Story 2. Here's something interesting. This film was originally a direct to video movie. But while in the process of making it, they realized how good it was turning out and decided to make it an theatrical movie. Thank Goodness, Pixar saw something in it, rather than continue the Disney's awful sequels cycle. The Pixar folks didn't want drop everything for the direct-to-video version. They make a brand-new story for the theatrical release because they wanted to; there was pressure from Disney to do a direct to video due to save money. The Pixar folks were sensing impending doom because they didn't know what to do, and as a last resort John Lasseter was called in from his long overdue vacation to fix the movie in time for its release. The process was rushed, messy, and nerve-wracking. But by God did it all pay off in the end!! Who knew that Toy Story 2 would partially lead to Disney's fall out with Pixar a few years later. Anyways the idea for the opening of this film was the original idea for the opening of Toy Story, only instead of a video game, it's a TV show. But the makers decided to scrap that idea and open the movie with play action with Andy, because they wanted to establish the bond between Andy and Woody in Toy story. Then when they made Toy story 2, they decided to bring back that idea only make it a video game. Still, that one impression video game for an early 2000's video game. My N64 and Playstation couldn't even be that good. The toys in Andy's room has just witness Woody (Tom Hanks) getting stolen by toy collector Al (Wayne Knight). Now Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) must sent a rescue mission to save him. While at the same time at Al's penthouse, Woody finds out how much he is value, and thinks about being display in a toy museum along with Woody's Roundup pals Jessie (Joan Cusack) and Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammar). The reasons is that, he knows deep inside of him that Andy will grow up one day and forget about him. The dilemma that Woody has, is a good dilemma and makes sense. In a way, foreshadowing Toy Story 3 so rather than being forgotten, he along with his new friends can be loved forever if he takes this chance with the museum in Japan. In the movie we get all the old characters of the first movie, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn), and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney in his last movie) as well as new characters such as Bulleye, and Weezy. I don't like how they forced feed us, Weezy. His character really came out of nowhere. Where was he in the original movie? Also check out, the scene was when Woody was being fixed up by the toy repairman, you might notice the toy repairman from the short film, Pixar's Geri's Game. The acting was pretty good, but Joan Cusack can be a bit annoying with her character. The story was well-written. The dramatic and emotional feel of the film has gotten better. The highlight back-story of Jesse just put you into tears, and that whole montage is told by one of the best songs in Disney's history. When somebody love me sung by Sarah McLachlan. I might not be a huge Randy Newman's fan, but the song works here. The humors works and I like how the film mocks old films and TV Shows like Star Wars and Howdy Dowdy. Pop culture references allow adults to get some jokes that kids might miss, but the kids will have a blast watching this animated adventure. This movie is more plot-oriented than the first--which kids will love and is hence more fun. The visuals are break taking and the action is challenging to the eyes. I actually really liked the secret villain. I certainly didn't see it coming the first time I saw the movie, and I thought his motivation made sense, and kinda made me feel sorry for him. The fact that he never been loved and played with gave him a very different psychology from the other toys. The museum would be the closest thing to love he felt he'd ever have, so of course he's going to do anything for that, and isn't going to have much sympathy for Woody wanting to return to Andy. This movie isn't for toddlers. Let me get that straight for any first time parent. Its better off, when the child has mature enough aged to the point where it's can be deemed right to watch due to the large noises, large yelling and visual effects that can hurt a toddler's eyes. It's PG rating, people, not G. I really can't find much that was wrong with this film. It's just a great watch. So check it out if you haven't watch it already.

Also, in 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list.Most interestingly, is that the film is partially inspired by Hammett's Glass Key, the same book that inspired Kurosawa's Yojimbo and Sergio Leon's Fistful of Dollars. While the themes here are much closer to the original Hammett novel, it is interesting to see the parallels in these three (or four) works, and watching the films back to back would bring a whole new outlook on their plots and characters.How the film failed to make back at the box office half of what it cost to make is beyond me... this is truly among the Coens' best work.

The results varied from the very good to the downright abysmal, and more often than not efforts were much closer to the latter. But with Tobe Hooper's pedigree including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist, expectations for Lifeforce would have been generally optimistic. However, hopes would soon have been dashed.The fairly standard plot takes elements from both the sci-fi and horror classic film staples - creature from outer space and vampires - to produce this latest entry into what would become the Sci-Fi channel's catalogue. A space shuttle investigates a ship that is discovered floating inside the core of Hailey's Comet, and discover 3 human-looking life forms in suspended animation, two male and one female - naked obviously! Ignoring every horror cliché in the book, the crew decide to bring them back to the ship. Inevitably, the ship returns to earth - but is now apparently abandoned - and the life forms are brought in for study. The female - played by Mathilda May - escapes and proceeds to wander around London -still naked of course - sucking the life force out of victims rather than blood (perhaps too cliché even for this work?) and chaos, death and zombies ensue. The story then plods along diligently, joining all the dots but seemingly devoid of any actual life force of its own.The cast is a veritable who's who of B- and C-list actors, with the interesting exception of a pre-Star Trek Patrick Stewart in an extended cameo, which perhaps makes this film valuable as a historical curiosity if nothing else. Unfortunately, with the vast number of sci-fi, horror and combination films that filled cinemas in the late 70s and into the 80s, something special would be needed to make a film such as this stand out, and Lifeforce doesn't have it, and it merely comes across as a cheap exploitation flick - which is ironic considering it was at one point shut down for running out of money, and was nearly named 'Space Vampires'! The cast in general seem devoid of inspiration, and stage and small-screen stalwarts such as Frank Finlay and Peter Firth appear to be merely there for the pay cheque.Next to films such as Star Wars and Alien, Lifeforce looks exactly what it was intended not to be - a cheap exploitation flick. The space scenes in particular (many of which were cut before release) look positively dated when placed next to the works of George Lucas and Ridley Scott, and Henry Mancini's score (which was partially re-edited and replaced with another composer's work upon US release) certainly doesn't measure up to his previous work, filled with toneless cues and un-atmospheric phrases that don't come close to his iconic work on films such as Breakfast at Tiffany's and The Pink Panther.Wooden acting, lousy special effects, a dull story and atonal music combine to make this nothing more than just another sci-fi cash-in from the mid 1980s. Seeing a young French actress spend an entire film naked may be a novelty for a scene or two, but this crass exploitation gimmick is certainly not enough to save Lifeforce from, at best, mediocrity.

After hearing the above lines in Kevin Smith's Clerks, I had no ambition to seek out the series because of the fact that I already knew all, or most, of the major, visceral plot points in the second installment, The Empire Strikes Back. But even knowing these details going in, I still emerged as enthralled and as taken as ever. It's one of the most awe-inspiring, gripping sequels I've ever seen.My love for the series of Star Wars, so far, has likely been because I don't try to understand it all. I allow myself to sink into the films, letting the film's imagination, and my own, take me on a cinematic Odyssey. The less I look into the meaning of it all and the interworkings of the characters and series, the more, I feel, I see in terms of vision, writing, atmosphere, and style. Thank goodness I took this approach to The Empire Strikes Back, which employs all these elements with slick, constant entertainment. It abandons the cheery, free-spirited style of its predecessor in favor of a much dark enigma. Never before have I seen a film go from comforting entertainment to sheer calamity within one sequel.Perhaps much of this is thanks to Irvin Kershner, who takes over for Lucas in the directing department. After achieving monstrous success with the original Star Wars, against all conceivable odds, Lucas, who was perplexed at how to follow up the hit, sidelined himself to executive producer and hired Kershner to lend his vision with the screen. New writers by the names of Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan were hired to continue the harrowing tales of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). I couldn't imagine the hesitation amongst fans when these creative decisions were made. They must've expected the absolute worst from a sequel to an explosive hit. Could it be like the extreme hesitation the Star Wars fanbase currently has now with J.J Abrams manning the camera and Michael Ardnt writing the script for the forthcoming Star Wars Episode VII in 2015, or should I not even mention that? The wonderful thing about these new faces being the driving forces behind this film is that we get a different spin on these characters and their lives that isn't drab, redundant, or contrived. Had The Empire Strikes Back adopted the same sort of easy-going charisma of its predecessor, this could've easily been a cheap rehash of previously successful material. Instead, Kerschner, Brackett, and Kasdan wisely choose to further develop these characters, making their problems more three-dimensional, their personalities more vivid, and their biographies more interesting.Again, there are some terrific and grandiose special effects put to use here. The effects on the Millennium Falcon and the exterior shots of a galaxy far, far away is just marvelous and very appealing on the eyes. I'm always amazed at the naturalism of these effects, even for the late seventies\/early eighties. Despite being largely products of computers and other visual mediums, they still possess an authentic and wonderfully realistic look to them.One particular instance is when Han, Leia, and the rest of the gang fly their ship into the asteroid farm, which is exactly what it sounds like. Dozens of asteroids hurl themselves at the ship at breakneck speeds, leaving Han (the driver) with little time to react and dodge them. The animation and visual technique of the asteroids is astonishing, and every moving object adopts gorgeous fluency and technical precision. It's a visual wonder to say the very least.The Empire Strikes Back beautifully carries the Star Wars franchise further than it might've even gone under the intense and uncompromising care of Lucas himself. The new faces delightfully provide us with more entertaining adventures and more eccentric characters such as Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), consistently keeping us in-tuned and intrigued with the limitless possibilities of this creative world. Like before, Hamill, Fisher, and Ford provide the most likable of chemistry, and the scenes of intensity and peril do not fall short of enthralling, even if one is aware of the outcome. There are many directions Return of the Jedi can take, but if it shows the gripping intensity of its predecessor and the truly mysterious nature of its original, then the possibilities are as endless as the galaxy the series inhabits.Starring Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, James Earl Jones, Frank Oz (voice), and Billy Dee Williams.

Firstly - the acting is good, for the most part. Freeman is good as the Dashiell Hammet\/Raymond Chandler inspired cynical old cop. Brad Pitt overacts every time he is on screen, making his unbearable character even more unbearable. Kevin Spacey does a suitably creepy (albeit cliché) job of portraying a sadistic, masochistic serial killer.However, my main beefs with the film lies not in the acting, but in the plot. There are plot holes abound (I encourage you to read the review se7en problems with se7en) but this isn't the only place where the film falls short. The entire story is predictable - as soon as we are introduced to Paltrow's character we know that she's going to be the subject of some nasty work. The final scene has to be one of the biggest anti-climaxes in film history...The religious fundamentalist angle.

The final scene has to be one of the biggest anti-climaxes in film history...The religious fundamentalist angle. Not that I'm overtly sensitive to negative portrayals of religion, but it's getting a bit trite, don't you think? John Doe (And yes, that's the name of the antagonist in this film...) killing so-and-so because the Big Man Upstairs told him so. I mean, why can't we have a serial killer inspired by Nietszche or Stephen Hawkings or Isaac Newton? Why does it always have to be religion? The tributes to film noir include the colour palette used (yup, you guessed it, if you were to compress the film into a single frame, then that frame would be mostly black and white), the fashion, the typewriter that Freeman's character uses, the taxis, the rain, the smog, the is-it-New-York-or-Chicago-nameless-city, the well-spoken and well-read central protagonist & antagonist, the endless references (atypical to noir and pulp) to literature such as Dante's Inferno But this doesn't come across as some new and profound take on it - as say Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs) or the Coenn Brothers (The Big Lebowski, Fargo) managed to do at a similar time, but it just comes across as a constant rehash of lamentable pulp and noir tropes that we've all seen before. It doesn't come across as engaging, entertaining, though provoking or cool - it's boring.Seek out films such as The Missing Person or Brick for a much more engaging take on neo-noir.

Die Hard really is action film-making at its best, and began a new type of actioner - the everyman caught in a unique situation - that many films would try to copy; some more successfully than others, but none would ever measure up to the original. That even includes the 4 (and counting) sequels! It would launch the careers of Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman skyward - admittedly on different trajectories - and even become a bizarrely popular choice for a seasonal festive film each December! John McClane (Willis) is a New York cop who has travelled to Los Angeles to reunite with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at a Christmas party in a city skyscraper, when an armed band of villains march in with machine guns and take over, led by Alan Rickman's evil Hans Gruber, holding the partygoers to ransom. McClane must then work his way through the building, picking off the terrorists one by one, fighting a one-man war while the LAPD pontificates impotently on the doorstep.The recipe is incredibly simple, yet brilliantly effective; the ludicrous situation is tempered by the Regular Joe nature of Willis's character, allowing the audience to identify wholeheartedly with his efforts and motivations, while hissing at the Machiavellian machinations of arch-criminal Gruber. The action itself is replete with some superb and exciting shootouts, spectacular set pieces and a new level of violence not often seen in such a mainstream action film before now - just watch for the scene with the broken glass, and you'll be wincing for weeks! Bruce Willis so perfectly captured the essence of his character, that the image, hair and even name have become synonymous with action heroes for all movies hereafter. The iconic shaved head and dirty white vest perfectly captured the feel of the right man caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, but it was not just Willis's physique and wardrobe that made John McClane such a hero. His fight scenes are brutally brilliant, and his delivery of both threats and sarcastic one-liners will have audiences punching the air and chuckling in equal measure. His radio exchanges with Rickman's Gruber are superb, and his charming banter with Sgt Al Powell on the outside - also over radio - lend the character an extra warmth that could easily have been missed, which would have made the character slightly less sympathetic.But every great hero needs a villain, and Alan Rickman produced a performance of a lifetime; one which would lead him to being pigeonholed as a great British 'character actor' - Hollywood code for 'plays great villains!'. Admittedly this would lead him to even further success, most notably as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, and of course Professor Snape in the Harry Potter films, but it was unquestionably this role that set him on the role to a reputation as one of the greatest villainous actors of the twentieth century. His performance is never overstated, and without resorting to scenery-chewing, makes every single line positively drip with threat and menace. But he is also allowed a few light moments of his own in between his shooting of innocent bystanders - darkly comic interplay with the FBI outside in particular. His arrogant dismissive nature of the FBI while reeling off a list of names the group want freed is particularly black - his request for one group that he then mouths to his associate that he 'read about them in Time Magazine' a standout. His ability to produce a villain who is both positively loathsome and yet darkly charismatic makes Die Hard just as much Rickman's film as it does Bruce Willis's. Jeremy Irons' attempt to reproduce this balance in the film's third entry pales in comparison, producing a villain that is fun, but unfortunately occasionally too camp to be truly hissable.The majority of the other characters are generally rather 2-dimensional, in particular McLane's estranged wife Holly, whose character is unfortunately lacking much in the way of back-story that could have made Willis's mission even more effective, whilst the henchman are as typically anonymous as you might expect from such an actioner. The rest of the attendees at the party are also mostly anonymous, making it difficult for the audience to truly get invested in their fate.But such quibbles are unquestionably minor next to the brilliance of the whole, and such was the film's success that virtually every action film of its type would thus be labelled as the 'new Die Hard' or the even more derivative 'Die Hard on a plane\/train\/boat\/submarine' (delete as applicable). So to see how films like Die Hard actioners should be done, it can only be Die Hard itself. A true era-defining film, one that even gained numerous name-checks in 'Friends' to demonstrate its iconic nature, that became a perfect template for all subsequent action films to follow.

While there, he steps over the line of himself by smuggling huge cartels of hashish out of the country. Without hesitation by the Turkish officials, Billy is sentenced to four years in prison.At first glance I had absolutely no sympathy for Billy as I felt the Turkish government was more than fair in Billy's sentencing. But as the movie progressed I started to take pity for Billy when the Turkish officials decided to expand his sentence to thirty years instead. The worst part is that they changed their minds after Billy was near to being discharged.At that moment I really thought hard and felt that though Billy committed a crime and should face some jail time, but I didn't think it was that bad that he should be jailed for thirty years.Sadly, Billy is very vulnerable. Even people who are fighting to get him out of prison like his father (Mike Kellin) and his Turkish lawyer had made the effort, but couldn't convince the Turkish authorities to get Billy out. So while on the topic of Turkish prison life, Midnight Express exhibits what goes on behind the walls in it's most graphic depictions you will ever see in your lifetime. The raping, the beatings prisoners endure and the #$%$ food are just some of the nasty routines that prisoners in Turkey face everyday of their lives. While in jail, Billy makes friends with some inmates like a frantic American named Jimmy, a gay Swede named Erich (Norbert Weisser) and a perpetually doped up Englishman named Max (John Hurt). The trio is seen together quite frequently, but violence rages on when Billy with the instincts like a wolf, actually annihilates another prisoner and literally rips the flash off the man's face.A lot of scenes are quite offencive and definitely not for the faint of heart. In one such case is when Billy's girlfriend (Irene Miracle) comes to pay him a visit. Though they were glassed apart from each other, Billy asks her to do remove her shirt so that he can bate the bishop. Nudity comes sporadically in the scene but it's only from the woman. The prison scenes feature more exposed nudity. The fighting displayed in the movie are quite graphic and at times over-the-top barbaric in its content. As you would expect in prisoner stories the language and profanity is often times gratuitous. In a rather disturbing scene that might not be for everyone involves Billy and Erich as they're in the shower together and they engage in the kiss, but you could clearly see that Erich wants to go beyond just a friendly kiss. Billy rebuffs the idea of taking it beyond. I for one don't have a problem with homosexuality, but for those who do might be disturbed by that scene.There are a lot of good thing about Midnight Express that make this movie special. The script was brilliantly written by Oliver Stone who won an Oscar for his achievement, and the movie was very impressive at the box office, but still I feel doubtful that this movie should be recommended. If you have never seen the movie and are curious about it don't let me stop anyone. I just felt very uncomfortable the whole time sitting through and was taken back at how cruel humanity can really be especially to those who go punished. Just be advised to those who would like to see Midnight Express, there are images that are graphic to the max.

With a $350,000 budget and eye-popping make-up effects from Tom Sullivan, director Sam Raimi unleashed a film that would change modern American horror forever. And that film I'm talking about is The Evil Dead.Five college-age friends spend the weekend at a deserted mountain cabin. In the dark basement they find and play recordings of mystical incantations, which elevate an angry group of hell demons intent on devouring their souls. One by one the luckless students are controlled by the demons except the mild-mannered and deviant Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell). Thus, Ash has no other choice but to mutilate the living corpses of his sister (Ellen Sandweiss), girlfriend (Betsy Baker) and two of his friends (Sarah York & Hal Delrich).While overcoming the problematic shoot for the cast and crew, Raimi unwittingly made horror film history in making the final survivor a male instead of the typical female victim in most '80s slashers. And Bruce Campbell is seemingly perfect for the role of Ash Williams. With his blue work shirt and all-American looks, Campbell played Ash as the average Joe who is not a jock or a ladies man but as someone whom we can root for. Stylistically, Raimi balances slow-moving suspense with his signature brand of humor more understated than the over-the-top aesthetic of the later sequels. Unfortunately, the filmmakers would soon find themselves in hot water.When The Evil Dead hit movie screens in the United Kingdom, the film received an X rating and being named as a video nasty mainly because of the notorious tree-rape scene. I found the whole video nasty controversy to be ridiculous because Sam Raimi was out to create a horror film he wanted to make without executive interference and egotistical actors.

Unfortunately, as awful as the Michael Keaton Batman films were, Batman Forever qualifies as infinitely worse. This incredibly far-fetched adventure seems less contrived than Batman and Batman Returns, but it suffers primarily from the shoddy screenplay writing skills of Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler , and Akiva Goldsman. Handsome Val Kilmer looks better suited to play the vigilante crime fighter, but his Batman behaves like a complete bimbo. He does so many idiotic things that you just want to throw up your hands in frustration. He allows himself to be trapped early on in a safe bursting with boiling acid. Not long thereafter as millionaire Bruce Wayne, he smashes his way without solicitation into the heroine's apartment because he fears that she is being assaulted. Later, the two villains waltz into Wayne Manor with comparable ease and then invade the Batcave to wreck havoc. Despite all these dreadful mistakes, Batman Forever looks much better than its predecessors. Lethal Weapon lenser Stephen Goldblatt makes this outing look exceptional and Schumacher maintains a swift pace. Schumacher must have been channeling the 1966 Batman because the palette of colors appears brighter and less film noir-like that the Burton Batman epics. The production designs of Barbara Ling, Christopher Burian-Mohr and Joseph P. Lucky's art direction, and Ingrid Ferrin & Bob Ringwood's costume designs distinguish this flawed film. One of the biggest problems with Batman Forever is that Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey chew the scenery with such maniacal relish that Kilmer's Batman seems hopelessly dull by comparison. One of the few things that Schumacher manages to do with some success is replicate the death of Bruce's parents on a dark street. Since Batman Forever is a reboot, virtually all the equipment has been redesigned, such as the Batmobile. This exotic looking car looks like a souped-up sneaker. The Batwing and the Batboat look cool, but they aren't around long. Nevertheless, when the Batwing is blown out of the sky, it takes more than The Joker's well-aimed, .22 caliber long rifle bullet to do the job. The thing that sets this Batman outing apart from the two earlier examples is the inclusion of Robin the Boy Wonder. Chris O'Donnell appears almost too old to play the acrobatic Dick Grayson. If you're a Batman fanatic, you know that the death of the Flying Graysons was scrubbed from the first Keaton Batman with The Joker responsible for their deaths. The scenarists do a better job with the warped psychological problems that Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson suffer from than the outrageous plot that piles one dumb exploit on top of another. Although it is a comic book opus, Batman Forever looks more realistic than the Burton Batman movies because the physical sets have a great sense of authenticity.

Jessup in A Few Good MenThere ain't nothing' more powerful than the odor of mendacity! ~Burl Ives as Big DaddyLast week I watched Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor and Burl Ives in the powerful Tennessee Williams drama Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Whoa, what a scorcher.THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSBurl Ives is Big Daddy, and he's coming home to celebrate his 65th birthday.. He's just finished having a medical exam to find out what was ailing him, and lo, he got a clean bill of health, so now he's smiling. He's ready to live large once again. The problem, from the start, is a problem of mendacity.Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is one of numerous Hollywood productions of Tennessee Williams plays and Williams introduces its theme early.Mendacity the quality of being mendacious; untruthfulness; tendency to lie.Brick (Paul Newman) is an alcoholic failed football star who has gone away and remained distant from his family; Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) the wounded wife pushed away by consequences she'd never anticipated. Newman had big time written all over him, but it wasn't to be as he now deals with his disillusionments. Gooper, his brother, became a lawyer and did all the right things to earn Big Daddy's blessing, but the story is complicated and Williams is brilliant at skimming off the layers of the onion to reveal the story's heart.Big Daddy is a self-absorbed, insensitive modern day (1950's) plantation owner who has more wealth than he knows what to do with. The situation that takes place in the space of a day tells the story of all their lives. Brick, who seems despicable at the first, is actually sees clearly how distorted the family dynamics are, and he wants nothing to do with any of it. His brother Gooper and his wife Mae are determined, as the good son and daughter-in-law, to get the blessing and all the goods that come with it. They've been faithfully producing potential heirs to the Big Daddy throne and waste no amount energy kowtowing and sucking up.In contrast, Maggie's womb is barren, though not because of her desire that it be so. Brick has emotionally cast her away because of an incident that occurred in a hotel room involving Maggie and his best friend Skipper, who committed suicide afterward. Brick shuts her out so that Maggie never has a chance to tell her side of what happened. The root incident, in keeping with the theme, turns out to be that Skipper couldn't face the truth either.The pivotal theme is mendacity. Big Daddy is definitely going to die and he doesn't know it, yet. This fact, which initially only the doc is aware of, begins to seep through the family and we see, one by one, the various ways in which the characters respond. Ultimately Brick lets it slip. Big Daddy is stunned.The film sets up Brick's character in the opening scene where at three in the morning he tries to run the hurdles, while booze-plastered. We see a brash young man who drinks too much, is careless and breaks his ankle in a foolish manner. The broken ankle serves as an external metaphor for the internally crippled man who deals with his pain through rivers of whiskey.As the film progresses the scales begin to come off the characters' eyes. What Williams does so effectively is to enable the audience to see who these characters are before they each discover for themselves who they really are. It's a Hitchcock device, except instead of a gun in the drawer that only the audience is aware of, it's our knowledge that at some point Big Daddy's going to discover the truth (that his cancer is incurable) that creates tension. Like Brick's broken ankle, Big Daddy's cancer is likewise symbolic of his inner condition. Unlike Brick, whose ankle will heal, Big Daddy's condition is terminal.They've all been living lies in one way or another. Ultimately we learn the root beliefs that formed the motivational drive in each character, with the ultimate revelation coming in the final basement scene with Brick and Big Daddy. It's a moment of truth that flows from the story yet of which the audience has know foreknowledge.This is not a film formulated strictly to entertain. It is a story designed to unveil uncomfortable truths, to enlighten. I have no doubt Williams' aim is for viewers to leave the theater introspectively, asking themselves how much mendacity and self-deceit they themselves live with.If you hear echoes of the parable of the prodigal son, you're probably not far off from the impetus for the original play.As for the acting, it's first-rate throughout.

Why? Basically, once Paul Newman gives up his former career to take up pool hustling, the movie slows to a crawl. We watch very long scenes of pool playing, very long scenes of him and his girlfriend...and everything moves so slowly, I lost interest and dozed off.The concept was good, but it needed more than long pool-playing sequences. The scenes continued longer than they needed to, and we never learn much about the protagonist or what motivates him to want to be a big-time pool hustler. We see what he does, but never come to learn why he is doing it. Disappointing.

Gordon's task? Strip a disused mental asylum of all harmful asbestos. The problem? Someone or something is killing Gordon's crew.Though initially confusing, Session 9 develops into a fairly straightforward horror-mystery. Due to stress, and possibly mental illness, Gordon kills his wife and child at home. These traumatic events lead to Gordan developing dissociative disorders and several split personalities. These split personalities are responsible for systematically killing Gordan's crew. Gordan's breakdown is then mirrored to the breakdown of a patient who attended the mental asylum decades ago. She, like Gordan, developed split personalities and was responsible for murder. Whilst the film implies that Gordan is suffering from a natural, psychological disorder, it is equally possible that a demon, called Simon, has taken possession of Gordan because he is weak and so able to be controlled. Some prefer to view Simon as a metaphor for Gordan's own fragilities and psychoses, others view Simon as a literal supernatural creature. The film supports both views.At its best, Session 9 maintains an air of tantalising ambiguity, Anderson constantly misleading or suggesting but never clarifying key ideas. For example is Gordan himself an ex member of the asylum? Was Gordan related to a girl whose psychoanalysis sessions play throughout the film? How much of the film is a hallucination? Are Gordan's co-workers figments of his imagination? Do the crew members conform to the split personalities introduced during the film's recording sessions? And so on and so on.Like Anderson's Vanishing on 7th Street, Session 9 makes great use of its low budget, and Anderson creates some effective, classy horror sequences. Unfortunately all ambiguity is ruined by the film's climax, which contain 2 large segments rife with flashbacks and explanations. The film is also a raging rip-off of The Shining, complete with title cards, a murderous husband, a wife named Wendy and numerous similar aural and visual cues. Thematically the films differ significantly; Kubrick's film is very much an anti Session 9.Session 9 was one of the first feature films to be shot with an HD camera. It co-stars the serpentine David Caruso.8\/10 - Worth one viewing.

On TV in the 1970's, they became respected oil sheiks who walked out of negotiations with the western world with confident smiles born of their new-found power and wealth. Perhaps they had just watched The Road to Morocco and were musing upon how the wheel of fortune had turned in their favour. The depiction of the women of the Middle East has also made a U-turn. They were once exotic bellydancing nyphs, now a set of black mailboxes. Arab leaders like Mullay Kasim as played by Anthony Quinn looked a bit dangerous but were easily outwitted by Bing and Bob. Mullay confronts the pair with Do you dare oppose the will of Mullay Kasim? to which Bing's character repliesOppose it! I'll have you writing one. Today's Arab leaders have at worst been transformed into evil fanatics to be feared and hated and at best to be shifty and potentially treacherous.The Road to Morocco is fun and makes fun of all stereotypes and customs - east and west. Bing selling Bob into slavery could be seen as a comment on the rapaciousness of capitalism or just another bit of outrageous fun. The best thing about watching it is that like Bing and Bob, we are all just along for the ride. Their Road characters are comic existentialists of the highest order - they appear from nowhere, live in the moment and fade out in a finale that underscores the fact that it has all just been a film. I know that the world has serious problems but it doesn't do us any harm to remember that like Bob and Bing, we need to get as much as we can out of our adventure while we can. It's also good to be able to share it with a friend. Thanks go to my dad who went through The Great Depression and fought in WW2 and who introduced me to the Road movies.
