To borrow a line from crazy Dennis Hopper in 'Apocalypse Now' you either love it or hate it. I can't see someone reaching a middle ground here. When I describe it as non linear I mean that it doesn't follow some standard young kid falls for an older women crap. It goes off on funny tangents.

It is a memorable musical with tunes to remember and an atmosphere to be charmed by. Not only is this a good movie, but one worth the price of a theater ticket (even though it is now available on home video and DVD, and no longer at the multiplex). I liked it---and I recommend it!The film's title, Why Do Fools Fall In Love, comes from the name of a song sang by the 1950's rock and roll group called The Teenagers. A key member in that band is Frankie Lymon, who was 13 when he had his big record hit and 25 when he committed suicide. The record had success beyond imagination for his band. Propelling them into the world of greed, fame, and confusion as gradually their team began to break apart and turn on each other, causing Frankie to turn to a life of drugs, the army, and sex, with his wife, of course...but did I mention he had three of them.Why Do Fools Fall in Love tells the inspiring story of how musical legend Frankie Lymon married three separate women without any of them having any knowledge of the other. The movie does not tell its story through the eyes of Frankie Lymon, however, but with the three women who all claim to be the wife of the late Frankie Lymon squabbling in court over the estate Zola Taylor (Halle Berry) who is a glamorous singer with the Platters, Elizabeth Waters (Vivica A. Fox), a crook who supported him so much that she took he love to the extreme to pay the money in which needed to be used for his drug rehab, and Emira Eagle (Lela Rochon), a religious school teacher who was always there for him after he was part of the Army and sent to Georgia for training. They each argue that they deserve the four million that Frankie held in his estate.The premise is informational and well structured. We learn who the main characters are, what we are dealing with here, and a clear problem. Although the emotional view point of this film is constantly changing, making it hard to root for anyone in the cast, for a long period of time the emotional side of the story stands out of the picture, because most of the story is told through flashbacks of the Spouses, and when in trial, the emotional point of view varies from person to person, making any of the flashback scenes irrelevant. Yes, the subject madder of the film is a little ridiculous, but I think the point of view that the director chose to use here is quite effective, nonetheless. One of the witnesses, Little Richard, provides cute comic relief in the middle of the dramatic heat.Much of this film is full of style and glamour. The singing scenes with Frankie are so inspiring and energetic it is hard not to want to clap for him at the end of his performance. Speaking of performances, Larenz Tate acts creatively and hip as Frankie himself. Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and Lela Rochon are all perfect in their roles as well. All of their characters discharge chemistry from one another.Around mid-point in Why Do Fools Fall In Love the hard truth sets in. Frankie Lymon becomes a has-been and discovers the world of crime and drugs. The movie losses its energy, becomes dark and goes down hill. Frankie gets in fights with druggies, his wife, his agents, and in an emotionally disturbing scene he even has the gull to throw his wife's pet dog out the window. This movie beings as a charm feast and turns into a profanely fueled, hard core slice of street life. This concept does not work, and in some ways, ruins the production. I think the filmmakers should have focused a little bit more on Frankie's successes than his failures, then we may have had a lot here.Even so, the last twenty minutes of the film we just great, and we leave the movie with a happy feeling inside knowing forever about the successes and disappointments of Frankie Lymon. Isn't that what this kind of movie exists for, informing us about somebody in an entertaining way. In that case, this is an imaginative gem of truth and lies.

Because in high school, sometimes it's not about what you look like or how smart or how nice you are, it's just about getting accepted.  That's why this movie stood out to me, because it's a true loser in high school getting a chance at what she always wanted-popularity.Watching Drew's character Josie go from a geek to pathetic to the most popular girl in school is both entertaining and true to life.  I assure you that if an old friend of mine had transfered to my school, become popular and built me up like Josie was built up, I would too become popular.In the end, when Josie talks about the different groups in high school, tears came to my eyes.  Tears remembering the people who impacted my life, never knowing that they did.  What we all wouldn't give to, six years later, go back to high school.  Being better looking, smarter and more prepared. But the truth is, some people are cruel in high school.  Those are the people who will always rememeber high school as the best years of their lives.

The plan is to harvest the altered tissue and use it to regenerate human brain cells.  Uh huh.  Sounds like McAlester could use a few more brain cells her own damn self.  This is not so much the plot of Deep Blue Sea as it is an excuse for a series of action set pieces involving humans and killer sharks.  Naturally the malevolent meanies escape from their pens and storm Aquatica, the floating science lab where McAlester performs her experiments with the aid of shark wrangler Carter Blake (Thomas Jane,) cook Sherman Preacher Dudley (LL Cool J,) and millionaire businessman Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson.)  Also assisting in the experiment are scientists Jim Whitlock and Janice Higgins (Stellan Skarsgard and Jacqueline McKenzie,) along with technician Tom Scoggins (Michael Rapaport.)The mayhem is helmed by director Renny Harlin, who is no stranger to the action sequence.  (For proof, I refer you to Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, Cutthroat Island, and The Long Kiss Goodnight.)  Harlin's ability to construct a thrilling scene cannot be disputed.  Unfortunately, his penchant for completely ignoring plot and character also cannot be argued. Technically this film is well mounted.  And the actors do an adequate job with what they are given.  But the screenplay simply does not allow for any real character development or involvement.  Jackson, Skarsgard, and Rapaport all do their usual top notch work, but in small and uncomplicated roles. LL Cool J is adequate in his comic relief function.  But what about the leads? Certainly Saffron Burrows is easy enough to look at, but can she really be believed as a genetic scientist?  No.  It is evident that the filmmakers realized this, for they managed to write in a scene whereby McAlester must strip down to her skivvies to escape from one of the sharks.  (A writer myself, I can admire the ingenuity which this required.)  As Blake, I initially feared that Thomas Jane was cast merely because he looked good in the bathing suit.  But I was pleased to find that he delivered a surprisingly sympathetic and well-rounded performance.  More than any other, I wanted his character to survive.Which brings me to the true fun of this movie - guessing who will die next, and how, and when.  What this film lacks in depth and insight, it makes up for in body count.  If you are familiar with the genre and think you already know all of the cliches, you will enjoy Deep Blue Sea.  It takes relish in subverting those standard cliches, in killing off characters in an unlikely order, and in surprising ways.  Indeed, the final action scene is practically groundbreaking in what it asks the audience to accept.The sharks are scary enough, I suppose, but I found them a bit disappointing.  Perhaps this is because we are simply allowed to see too much of them.  The reason that Jaws was so terrifying was because the shark remained a mystery.  We did not get a good look at the beast until the end. It left a great deal to the imagination.  Deep Blue Sea makes the unfortunate mistake of taking an omniscient point of view, frequently showing the sharks beneath the surface of the water.  Wouldn't it have been scarier to see the sharks only when the human characters see them?  I suppose the filmmakers were too impressed with their CGI effects to let that happen.  It is telling that the most riveting scene in the film is one in which characters are suspended from a great height, trying to climb skyward as the water level below rises, bringing a shark with it.  It is the fear of the shark, not the shark itself, which thrills.

Anyone with an open mind and any mind at all should be able to like this film, if not for the bizarre story for Michele Soavi's incredible visual style, the perfect performances by Everett and Lazaro, or just as a plain, good old time.Dellamorte Dellamore begins like a fun B-horror movie telling us of the care-taker of th Buffalora cemetery, Francesco Dellamorte.  In the cemetery some dead people come back to life 7 days after burial, but, Dellamorte isn't too bothered by this, he just takes it as part of his job to put the dead back in the ground, answering his door with a gun in hand, ready to dispense some Grim Reaper-type justice.  But, within the first three minutes we know from the visual complexity of the film that this won't be just any B-horror movie, and within the first ten minutes we get a glimpse of what is to come - a fascinating meditation on the difference (if any) between life and death, a philosophical look at insanity and loneliness, a recurring love story that grows more bizarre with each telling, and eventually a big old representation about how life is just what we make of it.  The dead returning and the whole zombie thing is just a doorway into Dellamorte's world.  Fortunately, it never takes itself too seriously, if it had it would be a dull bore, but thankfully Romoli throws in lots of wit and dark humor (I'd give my life to be dead), and Soavi never lets us get bored with his always moving, floating camera and elaborate but never over-done sets.Everett gives one of the best performances in film history because it is so subtle, he delivers his lines with just the right amount of sarcasm, cynicism, and un-emotionalism (is that a word?) to pull off what was probably an incredibly difficult performance - but he does it perfectly. Francois Hadji-Lazaro, playing Dellamorte's mute and retarded assistant manages to build more of a character with his simple one word vocab of Nyah and his facial expressions than most big over-done actors\/actresses in movies now-a-days.  Anna Falchi is mainly there to provide mysteriously beautiful looks, which she does, in all three of her roles and all of her many lives and unlives.  Soavi was the protogé of Italian horror-stylist Dario Argento, but in Dellamorte Dellamore he comes fully into his own with his own bizarre and incredible style.  This isn't just a case of the student copying the teacher, in this case the student might have even surpassed the master.  Ah, if only you could see one movie this life time.

Slater - the unlikely misfit becomes an anonymous pirate radio shock-jock and is quickly elevated to a benign cult hero (take note Cahrles Manson). He is loved by the young and hated by the old, including his totally unobservant, unaware parents who it is clear he will eventually become.His idolising students at the school rise up at his unwitting command and fight back against a system that didn't really deserve such a fuss being made over it. The kids triumph, DJ Harry Hardon goes mobile to avoid the cops, Slater gets laid and all this to a wicked soundtrack.Utterly, irritatingly daft, in fact dire. It may have been redeemed as a film if Slater's character was fat, ungly, pimple-riddled and a genuine nerd but his flimsly pretence doesn't fool anyone for a second.The aptly rebellious songs he plays as his DJ alter ego Harry Hardon are pretty good (Leonard Cohen, Sonic Youth, Rollins Band and the Pixies) but a good soundtrack a film doesn't make.

However, since my sophomore year I have been a fanatic.  Why?  Because Star Wars actually helped me through one of the more difficult parts of my life by giving me a positive message a feeling every time I viewed the trilogy.A New Hope, the first in the Star Wars saga, is perhaps the best of the trilogy (although I think Empire is a better motion picture) because it was a visionary breakthrough.

All of this is layered in with a classic story of a simple boy who rescues a princess with the aid of a pirate and a wizard.

George Lucas created a living, breathing universe while telling his story, giving others a chance to play around in it.  All of these traits give A New Hope the title of one of the greatest movies ever made.The acting in A New Hope is adequate.  I admit that some lines of dialogue are cheesy, but I have never encountered a movie that has had perfect dialogue.  Mark Hamill got better as time went on, but he did a good job as a wide eyed farm boy.  Harrison Ford did a good job as a nervous, but seemingly self-assured smuggler.  Carrie Fisher was good as a strong princess.  Alec Guinness, well, his acting is always excellent.  David Prowse and James Earl Jones create a menacing Darth Vader.

The special effects help tell the story in A New Hope, and they do the same thing in all the other Star Wars movies.  All of the machines and aliens were things that I had never seen before, yet seemed familiar.  They help to create the illusion of a living, breathing universe, with things happening elsewhere.

Because I am such a fan, I probably will not see anything wrong with any of the stuff that comes out on Star Wars that some outsiders do.

It doesn't have a lot of scenes where you know what was going to happen. And the acting was much better than the Jennifer Love Hewitt\/Neve Campbell movies nowadays.

The real reason this movie has its high ranking is that it grapples with hope - and hope, like all abstract notions, becomes concrete with introspection, and introspection takes time. This is not a prison escape movie.See this movie. Think about this movie. Talk about this movie.

A look at IMDBs top 10 shows several entirely different movies, from Star Wars to Schindler's List and The Godfather. The only characteristic shared by all 10 is that they are worth watching. So, since Shawshank held the #1 slot for many months, it received plenty of ranting, illogical, completely undue criticism* That its characters were static - Simply not true. They do become moral icons by the end of the movie, but they evolve into their parts.* That there is too much preaching\/narration\/babying - There is nothing out of place in this movie. Red doesn't labor his narration because he's pedantic, he does it because he's straightforward - this isn't a college professor speaking - and absolutely, astoundingly beautiful. Yes, there is the panoramic shot of the azure pacific at the end - but it dovetails neatly with the story - Something that big would scare me. (Not verbatim).* That there are perhaps 15 minutes at the end of the movie in which the fate of the characters is clear and 5 after questions have been resolved - This is absolutely necessary.

But keeping in mind that people didn't think he could do it back then, why are people surprised to now see him playing a more intelligent role (ala Moonlighting)?Willis' portrayal of Dr. Malcomb Crowe was flawless. With a depth of character rarely seen by action movie actors, Willis manages to be a fully believable average guy in The Sixth Sense, giving what may be his finest performance to date. Accepting this role may surprise people as much as Mel Gibson playing Hamlet, but he plays the part with no less style or skill than Gibson used in the Shakespearian classic.Having said that, Willis does NOT put on the best performance in this movie. (Sorry Bruce) Haley Joel Osment, who plays Cole Sear, is astounding. Child Actors do not typically have the experience to play the role of someone as psychologically disturbed as Cole. Not so in this case. Haley makes you believe that he has experienced everything his character has with every tear shed and look of horror on his face. If there was ever an actor who deserved recognition in the form of an Oscar, Osment is in the running.Some critics claim the movie is slow moving, and in a way it is. At least if you can consider starting a movie with a madman breaking into the house and shooting the leading man in the gut as slow moving. The Sixth Sense is not as fast paced as some movies, but in that is much of the movie's appeal.

You are lulled into complacency and then brought to the edge without a moments warning, and all with a class and style that lets you know the Hitchcock style of film making is still very much alive.This movie wraps itself up neatly with a plot twist to make the writers and producers of The Game green with envy. The final scene answers questions you did not even know needed asking.

They both, it transpires, have potentially murderous secrets in their past involving the incineration of unwanted relatives (a child and a father). After a roundabout, deliberately vague confession to each other they erupt into childish laughter and it seems their relationship is cemented in their mutual utter lack of remorse.There is no guilt felt by either woman for any of their crimes be it spite, neglect, theft, opening other's mail, arson or even murder. This is because, primarily though Jeanne's obsessive class angst and Sophie's obsessive paranois, they justify their stance and actions with an us against them the world self-righteous fervour. Jeanne describes all her - increasingly erratic - behaviour as a good deed and the equaly unstable Sophie believes her.Every role is acted impeccably by some of the leading lights of French cinema. Along with Bonnaire and Huppert, arguably the best French actresses working today,  Jacqueline Bisset plays the bourgeouse lady of the house for whom Jeanne works.

This is also the opening week of Dick the first film to look at the Watergate scandal with a comedic slant. A good friend once gave me a quote which I think applies to perfectly to the film, Tragedy plus time equals comedy. I suppose it was only a matter of time before someone decided to make a comedy about one of the worst constitutional crisis the United States has ever faced. Thankfully, Dick is a beautifully written film which pulls big laughs from the situation without being trite or demeaning to the historical importance of the event.The film introduces us to two girls Betsy, and Arlene who find themselves unwittingly involved in the Watergate scandal. The girls end up being key players in the eventual resignation of President Nixon through a series of coincidences and missteps. Betsy, played by Kirsten Dunst, is the attractive dumb one. Arlene, played by Michelle Williams is the slightly less attractive slightly less dumb one. If the basic plot of Dick sounds contrived that's because it is. However this basic plot is executed very well, and the laughs in this film are the result of intelligent writing and excellent acting. One thing is for sure, I will never be able to listen to Hello Dolly again without thinking of Soviet Prime Minister Leonid Brezhnev.All the bigger players from the Nixon Administration are on hand for this film all played by classic character actors. Harry Shearer plays G. Gordon Liddy with the perfect combination of paranoia, while Saul Rubinek, who looks nothing like Kissenger, nonetheless gives a spot on performance as Kissenger with subtle mannerisms and that classic Kissenger celebrity craving. Of course the biggest kudos must go to Dan Hedaya who portrayed Nixon not as a caricature, but as a real man embroiled in a scandal he cannot stop no matter how hard he tries. I have always liked in Hedaya in almost anything he is in, I also used to think he was a one trick pony since he was so often cast in roles similar to his Nick Tortelli character from Cheers. Dick proves that the man has incredible range as an actor Hedaya's Nixon is the best portrayal of the man Hollywood has attempted. I believed I was really watching President Nixon talking to two 15 year old girls by the end of the first scene.Only two characters in Dick are played solely for laughs and funnily enough it is Woodward and Bernstein. Woodward is played by Will Ferrell of SNL fame. He is portrayed as a  self-absorbed jerk who is only interested in furthering his career off the Watergate scandal.  Bruce McCulloch from The Kids in The Hall plays Bernstein as a no-talent hanger on who desperately attaches himself to Woodward's coat-tails for a shot at the big Pulitzer roller coaster ride. Both men dislike each other intensely in this film, and it is played for excellent comic effect. This is not the Woodward and Bernstein we saw in All the President's Men, and quite frankly I enjoyed Ferrell and McCulloch's portrayal more than I did Redford and Hoffman's.One of the most remarkable aspects of Dick is how well the film incorporates actual historical events surrounding the Watergate fiasco into the film to help advance the plot. All the unanswered questions of Watergate are answered in the ingenious script by Andrew Flemming. Flemming also takes the helm and directs the film with a subtle touch, His recreation of famous film clips with his actors is incredibly realistic and at the same time tinged with a dark wit and classic political satire. I have not seen any of his previous work, but I believe Flemming will be one to watch in the future.This film will play well for most anyone who sees it, but people who have some previous knowledge of the Nixon administration and The Watergate affair will enjoy it much more. For real film\/history buffs a repeat viewing of All the President's Men before watching Dick will heighten the experience tremendously. The word on the street is that Dick is getting killed at the box-office mainly because of all the big budget new releases which have come out in the last few weeks. This is a real shame since Dick is easily one of the funniest films of the year so far, and it seems that this brand of political humor is almost extinct from American Cinema.Overall score A  ","genre":null},{"date":"10 August 1999","score":"","review":"  Today marks the 25th anniversary of the resignation of President Richard Nixon.

Crowe's big romantic pick-up in the first half founders on the claustrophobia of his overly cosy domestic arrangement - a plot point engineered only by pushing Thompson's well-meaning intrusiveness beyond all reasonable limits; but this is as nothing compared to the contrivance of having Thompson suffer a debilitating stroke just as his girlfriend walks out on him.
