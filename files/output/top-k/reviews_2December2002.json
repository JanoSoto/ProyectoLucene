And for the ladies really cute guys that kick ass!Annoying overuse of slow motion. High on visual style, but WAY too long and full of plot holes and absurdities likeSPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!How in the heck did a Mohawk Indian (who looks quite Asian) become a martial arts master? For that matter how did a naturalist become a martial arts master? What was the whole point of the secret society controlling the beast? What the heck was the beast? A beast from Africa, what, a lion? I've never seen any lion move like that thing could. It sure didnt look like a lion, although we never see it without it's suit of armor on. And the number one absurdity (common to all martial arts films) when five or more people, all holding sticks, swords or other sharp pointy objects have the hero surrounded, WHY do they always insist on standing there and taking him one at a time, so he can kick their butts singly, instead of all just rushing him and making a human pincushion out of him? It's silly.END SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IMHO Brotherhood of the Wolf is over-rated. Put some Matrix style fight scenes in and people seem to think you have a good movie. Don't get me wrong, I like action and horror films, but this was not a good one. Even my wife, who likes martial arts films more than I, thought this was way too over the top. But my niece pretty much summed it up with I don't care about the stupid story, the indian guy looks great with his shirt off, and he kicks ass. Well there you have it...

Aliens was at the time, my favorite movie ever, and I wanted to see a much better follow up to it and Alien than the mostly mediocre Alien 3.  The result? An okay film that could have been better (aren't most films like this nowadays?)***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***I won't reveal the plot, except that Ripley has been cloned by the evil 'Corporation', and yes, once again, the Corporations' own greed backfires on them.  We get some cool characters, nice sets and plenty of action...so what went wrong?First, before I go into that, I'll go into more detail with the good points. I loved the setup, like Alien, straight and to the point.  I thought the atmopshere at the beginning was very creepy and very claustrophobic, especially with the musical score.  The beginning (before everything gets FUBAR), is well done, well directed and most importantly, well lighted. The atmosphere is dark and creepy, just what we need to get into our fantasy\/horror film mode.  The characters are cool, but not nearly as cool as the seasoned hombres we saw in Aliens.  Michael Wincott (The 'bad guy' actor with that incredibly cool voice from Robin Hood and The Counte of Monte Cristo), Ron Perlman and some others you know you've seen before on tv make up a pretty good supporting cast\/alien fodder.  Sigourney Weaver, as usual, really shines as she resumes her role as Ellen Ripley, this time, as an Alien hybrid.  The movie sports some good action scenes, and a few scares, though mostly for shock value (loud sound effects mixed with buckets full of gore).  There are some creative scenes given the time period and the setting (a cube of whiskey being heated in a shot glass, the futuristic weapons, the alien labs...etc).  As for the special effects, not too shabby, especially the part where we see the camera go down inside a screaming man's throat to see an alien chest burster about to make it's appearance. Okay, now comes the part I'm sure will be ubiquitous for those who read other reviews on this one on this site...so far, I've given this one so pretty good reviews to be fair and give credit where credit is due, but like everyone else on this site, I just have to vent my frustrations now on the bad parts of Alien 4...First, did I like this one better than Alien 3?  That's a tough one since all four Alien films have different directors and look and feel differently from one another.  But did I like it over the often visually stunning, yet ultimately disapointing sequel directed by Fight Club director David Fincher?  Yes, but not by much (what can I say?  I'm a sucker for 'survival horror' with plenty of guns and ammo).  Alien 3 suffered from too many underdeveloped characters that we couldn't give a damn about (a la Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None) and just one slaughter scene after another.  This one is a little different in that most of the characters are developed, at least minimally, yet, they are still picked off in pretty much the same way as Alien 3.  The thing that frustrated me the most was that Michael Wincott and Dan Hedaya's characters, both pretty well developed at the beginning, make you think that they will be really important to the storyline, but no, they are among the first to be killed off...though I was looking for another 'Hicks' in Wincott who is a great actor, I may have to give a few props to the writer in that noone truly expects both the leader of the mercenaries and the leader of the marines to die before the movie hits it's 3rd chapter.  Besides that, there are some stupid deaths (especially the last, and truly unnecessary death aboard the space ship...that one made me groan so much, it was so obvious that it was tacked on for no good reason), some stupid decision making and totally unrealistic scenes.  There are scenes that make you go, that makes no sense at all, just like when the mercs. kill off a squad of marines...were they asking for it? No, they were just doing their job, but what do we care?  The only reason I bring these frustrations up is not b\\c I don't like violence (Evil Dead 2 and Dead Alive are amongst my favorite 'Over the top' films), I think it can be done well for camp or horror purposes, but b\\c I can't stand when filmmakers put such stupidity on the screen (from characters, and the plot) and think that noone in the audience will think otherwise.  That really insults my intelligence, and I know others.  I have to agree, Alien 4 plays like a video game, which is mostly bad than good b\\c we don't want to see this in an Alien movie.  The Alien movie (1-3) all based their horror elements on the human psyche...how given people would react to a given situation, and they all suceeded.  Alien 4 doesn't give a crap about the human psyche or that inner fear inside, instead, it relies on visuals (though, it does have some impressive ones at that) and a fast-paced (almost Jerry Bruckheimer-like) plot that goes from one scene of impending doom to the next.  I have to agree with many posters on this site...the aliens are just overexposed...the real fear in the others was the clandestine nature of the aliens; the sounds they made, the motion sensors used to track their movements, the looks of fear of the trapped victims' faces.  All of these made us jump out of our seats after the suspense had been built up for so long.  This one goes for a newer generation I guess, one that likes quick thrills and not much else.  I thought the alien hybrid at the end was so stupid, almost comical looking, though brutal (Brad Dorif's death was classic...if only he would have shut his stupid mouth...LOL...if you have seen it then you'll know what I mean).  Which goes to show you, just because a plot idea may be new, it is not necessarily a good idea.  In a weird way, I almost wish that the ending to Alien 3 was the grand finale (though from a rather weak film at that).All in all, not too bad.  It is entertaining at times, but it just doesn't give the true fans what we crave, true survival horror.  I don't think any sequel will top Alien or the much better in terms of horror and excitement, Aliens.  Aliens was such a good film, filled with action, suspense and characters you rooted for towards the end (and for the person on this site who called Aliens a Vietnam Revenge allegory that is a disgusting NRA wet-dream, I have to say that you are totally wrong...just because a film has violence, or even in this case, marines who crack under the pressure and go nuts given the situation, does not make it symbolic of the vietnam war, nor does it excite those of us who happen to support the NRA and the right to bear arms.  Aliens is simply entertainment at its finest, and truly embraces the human condition as most characters reach an epiphany of courage at the end as they've had to change over the course of the movie.  It is not a generation flick for blood thirsty 'cowboys' who grew up watching Rambo and Arnie blow people away).  Aliens truly was a film that was almost flawless, in my opinion, in terms of what it was aiming to accomplish. What was Alien Resurrection trying to accomplish?  $$$$.  Plain and simple. Anyways, I would only recommend this one for die-hard fans, but even most of them will range from somewhat to incredibly disapointed by this one, but yet, not as disappointed as they were with Alien 3 (though I know that opinion will vary).  Yet, it is still entertaining, and a good way to kill a couple of hours.  Not the worst movie I have ever seen, but definitely not the best.  Overall, I did like it, and think it has more pluses for the sake of entertainment than negatives.  I add one more star to my rating just b\\c of Sigourney Weaver doing a kick @ss job this time around, and of course, seeing the silver screen's best 'creatures from another planet' return once again.  Though this one was almost a 6, I give it my slightly above average rating of 7\/10 stars.

Overall, I did like it, and think it has more pluses for the sake of entertainment than negatives.  I add one more star to my rating just b\\c of Sigourney Weaver doing a kick @ss job this time around, and of course, seeing the silver screen's best 'creatures from another planet' return once again.  Though this one was almost a 6, I give it my slightly above average rating of 7\/10 stars.

I was certainly thinking about this film after it ended - what had happened? Had the schizophrenice Donnie imagined the evetns of had he travelled back in time to make the ultimate sacrifice?This film is both excellently written and directed by Richard Kelly, some of the highlights of the script include a discussion of the sex-life of smurfs and a scene in which one of the characters gives Donnie a cigarette and says 'good s***, huh?' To which Donnie replies ' Its a f***ing cigarette.' The film's dark atmosphere is reflected in the filming techniques, casting a lot of the screen in shadow.The characters are all believable and identifiable. In particular, Beth Grant's psychotically conservative, god-loving Mrs Farmer. One of her best lines is when she tells Donnie's parents during a meeting with the principal that 'he told me to forcefully place it in my anus!' and Donnie and his father find it hard not to laugh. Again, Donnie's mother's frustration as she deals with this woman is fun to watch. Donnie's guardian angel, Frank the Bunny is chilling, from his terrifying mask to his rough voice. 'why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?' 'why do you wear that stupid man suit?' Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle convey their characters well as great teachers struggling to teach their kids something beyond the prescribed syllabus and risking their jobs in the process and Patrick Swayze as an oh-so-eighties self-help guru with a chilling secret. Finally, the performance from Jena Malone as Donnie's bored, depressed girlfriend Gretchen Ross is excellent.The story begins when Donnie is guided away from his house by an apparition called Frank the Bunny on the second of October 1988 and is told that there are 28 days left before the world ends. He returns home to find that the engine of a plane has fallen in to his bedroom. The bunny has saved his life. From them on, he does what his guardian angel tells him to do and tries to discover as much about himself and about time travel as he can before the world ends.After the credits had rolled, I interpreted this film as the opposite of 'its a wonderful life'. I can not go into any more detail about this without spoiling the movie for me. What I will say is, do yourself a favour and see this film. It is one of the year's best.

My Mum had told me not to watch it, but as I was a typical 16 year old it made me want to watch it more. The first time I watched the film I was at school and it was too noisy to hear and follow the story as anyone will know due to it's non-linear narrative. I borrowed the film and watched it at home, again and again and again. I was hooked. After watching Pulp Fiction I bought Reservoir Dogs and was once again met with the feeling that this guy, the director is a genius. Since then I have seen Natural Born Killers, Four Rooms and From Dusk Till Dawn. I have unfortunately not yet got round to seeing True Romance or Jackie Brown but believe me they will be worth the wait I'm sure.Returning to Pulp Fiction I can without a doubt say that this is my favourite movie in the whole world, although every film by Quentin Tarantino is to me breathe taking in some way, the cast, stories, direction and overall look of a film, to me make it the best of his work and anyone else's. John Travolta is a winning star in my eyes and when paired with the stunning cool of Samuel L. Jackson, the die hard persona that is Bruce Willis, the over powering presence of Ving Rhames and other cast members such as Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken and Tim Roth to name a few all add to the fascinating insight into life as a gangster. The dialogue is quick witted, cool and intelligent yet is so powerful with extracts from the bible placed perfectly in order to change murder into a scene as close to beauty as such a scene can be.I would recommend for anyone who has even a half a brain cell to see this film, even if it is just so they turn around and say I don't like it it is the sort of film that will eat away at you until you finally admit that there is something within it that you love.

Well, perhaps HOOK is Spielbergs worst movie, or maybe THE LOST WORLD.  Here's a directer whose imagination can make us laugh, cry, or be thrilled, sometimes all in the same movie. Yet brings to every sequel  a feeling of claustrophobia mixed with unexpected boredom.  I include HOOK here not only because it was a complete mess, but because it is, indeed, a sequel. Like all of Spielberg's sequels, INDY 2 takes place largely indoors.  The first scenes (unlike the terrific RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC) show INDY in a nightclub, then he continues to the backseat of a car, and then boards an airplane, all at night!  Likewise, both HOOK and LOST WORLD were filmed largely indoors, and in stuffy, nighttime scenes that seem to be shot in a studio.  HOOK's Never-neverland never looked like it was really outside, even (or especially!) when the scenes took place in the daytime. But back to INDY 2.  During the all too short journey to the TEMPLE, there is absolutely no character development, nor is there any progression of the plot.  Indy was not assigned to this job, nor does he need to bring along Willie Scott at all.  Indy knows nothing about her, and this is still true by the end of the movie.  Once the film enters the TEMPLE, there are very few scenes where daylight can be seen.  There is even a scene near the end, where the slave-children run out of their prison into the courtyard, and they have to shield their eyes from the sun.  The audience has to do this too!  In an adventure film, there should not be such a scene. Anyway, I still respect Mr. Spielberg's work, and I love many of his movies.  Minority Report was a delight, as were his earlier Sci Fi movies.  His historical films like Private Ryan and Amistad were also well made, as was, of course, Schindler's Liste.So, my message to Spielberg is this  You don't need the money anymore, so make movies that are original and good.

The plot is very simple and has often been imitated and the tone of the movie is said in its tagline the snobs against the slobs.  Who are the snobs?  The men of Bushwood country club, the snobby Bishop, Dr. Beeper, who never seems to be at his office and the obnoxious leader of the pack Judge Smails, played by Ted Knight.Who are the slobs?  There is Ty Webb, a wealthy man who plays without keeping score.  Carl Spackler is a groundskeeper that smokes a little too much.  And of course the biggest snob of them all, developer Al Czervik, outspoken, obnoxious and completely out of place in a country club. Rodney Dangerfield plays him, Ty Webb is played by Chevy Chase and Bill Murray plays Carl Spackler.These characters rub together uncomfortably in various forms to create all-time great comedy moments.  What makes this movie so good is there is no star that dominates the movie.  Everyone dominates the stage equally. They all have great lines and they work very well together.This comedy is extremely dirty and raunchy even by today's standards.  The raunchiness has worn off with time and some of the take-offs are not so obvious to future generations but some of these lines have become well known jokes among some.  Part of the reason this movie works so well is the jokes are rapid fire.  They just hit you with one line after another.One thing I noticed watching this movie is that these characters pop out at you.  These people are incredible snobs, incredible sluts, extremely insulting, or just weird.  There are no really neutral characters.  Every character in this movie does something that makes them stand out if not for a few seconds.  This can be accredited to the great writing and directing by Harold Ramis one of the great comedians of our day despite the fact he is very underrated and is mostly these days behind the cameras.Another thing about these characters is that they seem so real.  Today a lot of characters in comedy films are cardboard characters.  All of the characters here are written so nicely and believably and this is something very rare in modern comedy.  And there are so many classic scenes in this movie.  Among my favorites is the boating scene, the swimming pool scene, and when we see Rodney Dangerfield's golf bag phone.And there are many great small parts by people like Albert Salmi, who plays Danny Noonan's father, Brian Doyle-Murray, who plays Lou Loomis, Scott Colomby who plays a troublemaking Caddy named Tony D'Annunzio, and Sarah Holcombe plays Maggie O'Hooligan, Noonan's girlfriend, Cindy Morgan plays the niece of Judge Smails, Lacey Underall, Henry Wilcoxon plays a rather bigoted Bishop Fred Pickering, Dan Resin plays a rather uncaring Dr. Beeper and there are many other great small parts.  All of these small parts are very good.  But one thing to notice is all of the ironic names like Lacey Underall, Maggie O'Hooligan, Dr. Beeper and plenty of other funny names.The movie is a bit dated.  Everyones hair is very long, the segway music seems heavily disco influenced, there are a lot more people wearing plaid, and there are jokes about people like Dick Cavett when so few people today know who he is.  I love some of the more pointed humor in this movie, but I like the effect of the age of the movie.  The movie makes some rich people look like callous uncaring bigoted fools and has some not too king rich people talk very bluntly (such as Smails' nephew say he knows some drugs are good because he got it from a Negro) Be forewarned this could be an offensive movie to some.My hat is off to the two leads, Rodney Dangerfield and Chevy Chase.  Bill Murray is funny too but his part is very small and this is not the best showcase of his talents.  But Chase is goofy to no end.  In this part he always manages to say the most off the wall comments that are hysterical. Dangerfield uses his patented rich obnoxious out-spoken character and make it fit this movie so perfectly.  His insults are classic.Unfortunately after this movie Chevy Chase made few quality movies.  These days he prefers to do mostly family oriented movies that are mostly not funny.  It is sad he has chosen to do so few straight comedies.  He has essentially been a comedy legend based on some raunchy movies like this one and Vacation but chooses not to star in these kinds of movies anymore.  It is sad.  He is one of the funniest people in my generation and he probably could have been even funnier.And I love the soundtrack.  The song by Kenny Loggins, I'm Alright is great and more songs by Eddie Cochran and Earth Wind and fire are great as well. And who could forget that little gopher?  He was actually created by George Lucas.  Some of the funniest scenes in the movie involve that little gopher. Overall this is a funny movie that has withstood the test of time and will probably be funny to future generations as well.

The chemistry between Chris Farley and David Spade is excellent, more so than in Black Sheep. Chris Farley's physical comedy and David Spade's sarcasm gives their characters great depth. Their characters are very believable and consistent with the type of roles they play on tv's Saturday Night Live. The supporting roles were very believable as well. Rob Lowe does a good job as the bad guy. I saw Tommy Boy before Black Sheep- I didn't care for Black Sheep. I think Black Sheep fails in comparison because the characters in tommy Boy are much stronger. It was hard for me to believe their characters in Black Sheep- I was expecting more of their characters from Tommy Boy because what they exhibited in Tommy Boy is in fact much like themselves. I recommend viewers watch Black Sheep first and then watch Tommy Boy. Overall I think that the movie is one of the best comedies of the '90s. The jokes in this movie are very funny- the I'm a maniac... scene is classic Farley. This movie has high replay value so it worth having a copy of. Whenever you're in the mood to laugh- you can count on this film for comic relief.

Rob Lowe does a good job as the bad guy. I saw Tommy Boy before Black Sheep- I didn't care for Black Sheep. I think Black Sheep fails in comparison because the characters in tommy Boy are much stronger. It was hard for me to believe their characters in Black Sheep- I was expecting more of their characters from Tommy Boy because what they exhibited in Tommy Boy is in fact much like themselves. I recommend viewers watch Black Sheep first and then watch Tommy Boy. Overall I think that the movie is one of the best comedies of the '90s. The jokes in this movie are very funny- the I'm a maniac... scene is classic Farley. This movie has high replay value so it worth having a copy of. Whenever you're in the mood to laugh- you can count on this film for comic relief.

I really did, for my ex-boyfriend's sake, and for the fact that David Lynch is apparently considered a genius.  But the movie was just dreadfully boring.  I don't know how it made the imdb's top 150 because it seems like the general consensus here was that  it wasn't particularly good.As I recall, the acting was sort of lackidasical, as if the actors wanted to be somewhere else.  The lesbian scene seemed awkward and out of place...it didn't belong in the movie, it seemed like Lynch just put it there just for the sake of arousing the male viewers.  It lended nothing whatsoever to the plot.  I never did finish watching the movie, because the lesbian scene fueled a fight between my boyfriend and I when I told him that I thought it had nothing to do with the plot and was, in a way sexist.  I now cringe whenever I hear the name David Lynch and I don't think I'll be viewing any of his other movies.  Unless someone could convince me that his other movies are more worth my while.

Don't get me wrong, I knew it was a crime\/action movie. Does this mean, no criticism needed? It claims to be neutral in the end, but through the hole story it sympathizes with the poor handsome men who kill for a better world. My first opinion was, it is intended to see the main actors with sympathy, I waited for these guys to turn bad. Instead you watch them enjoy it to kill, still they are cool, funny, loving brothers and we should be entertained. I liked the nonlinear storytelling, but what does it help with this stupid story? Even Defoe looks awful in such a dumb role with this senseless habits and disgusting opinion. Create a REALLY bad character, let him be executed and let people watch it in fact, many of us are enjoying this, there is no other reason for black and white hollywood. No other reason for high ranking of The Boondock Saints either. At least, quite a BAD right-party propaganda movie.

It is truly one of the greatest horror movies ever made.Horror films can be seperated into two types in my opinion. You have the horror films that depend on blood and gore to tell a story but then you have horror movies like this that depend on subtle shocks and the anticipation of terror to scare an audience.Edward Woodward plays Police Sergeant Howie who lives in Scotland but travels to an island off the coast to investigate the disappearance of a girl (without arming himself with a truncheon or handcuffs). At first, the islanders seem normal enough, aloof more than anything. However, gradually Sgt. Howie faces hostility and as a devout Christian, he is horrifed by some of the pagan practices on this island. He meets the Island Lord played by Christopher Lee who seems a nice chap at first...This is quite a realistic film. Even today in the UK, pagan rituals are practised in certain parts such as the south of England and Scotland. Those who practise pagan rituals believe that their way is right and do not take kindly to those who would try to change their way of life.Back to the film, Sgt. Howie becomes stranded on the island and because he foolishly didn't bother packing a truncheon or handcuffs, he has to depend on his wits to stay alive as the locals become more and more hostile.I will not give away the ending of this film because if you haven't seen it and I give it away, it's power to shock will be diminished. It is a truly horrible ending that sticks in your mind for days. I watched this film again at New Years Eve 2001 and the ending still shocked me, it's image ingrained on my mind for days.The truly scary thing about the activities of the pagans is that they do not actually believe that what they do is wrong. A conventional person may look at their practices and think that they are evil but a pagan will look at his\/her rituals in an entirely different manner. Nothing is black and white.I believe there is going to be a remake of this film but nothing could ever match up to this masterpiece.
