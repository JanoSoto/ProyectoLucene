Ephron was among the best we've ever had. And her work in 'You've Got Mail' is a gentle reminder to the statement I just wrote before. The Screenplay blends romance with humour, admirably. And there is a certain sweetness to this story, which adds freshness to the tale. Ephron's Direction is excellent, as always. Performance-Wise Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan are lovely here. They sparkle magic & sustain it till the very end. Also in superb form is Greg Kinnear, who despite having a very brief role, leaves a mark.On the whole, 'You've Got Mail' is a must watch for all the romantics out there. Recommended!

It inspires excellence in the film craft, both in terms of its excellent production quality from the crew and the beautiful performance by the cast of the movie. The fact that the movie is based on true events inspires me even more. For me, Brave Heart is the greatest patriotic movies of all times. I never get tired of watching it, and every time I watch it I'm doubly inspired; first it makes me reaffirm my decision to live my life a dedicated patriot of my country, and secondly to dedicate myself as a filmmaker to producing movies that will impact positively on humanity. I love the great plot of the story, the amazing epic setting, and my most thrilling of all; the perfectly choreographed BATTLE OF STERLIN BRIDGE. It has also inspired a couple of my works as a filmmaker. It's a must watch for every filmmaker!

Except for a brief men-in-waders scene, this verbose exercise in talking sex to death might as well have been filmed on Broadway. Sure, there's a few touches of window dressing with have-and-have-not automobile comings and goings, as well as a walk-through of a couple high-ceilinged rooms. However, these scant minutes' worth of real life hardly provide an adequate antidote for what seems like hours of grueling repartee that may have sounded scintillating in a playwright's mind, but generally fall flat on stage, and pancake to paper thinness on a Big Screen. As a supposedly accommodating husband, Cary Grant looks particularly long-in-the-tooth, making his willingness to settle for his wife's sloppy seconds entirely reasonable (if not very convincing). However, Deborah Kerr's wayward wife Hilary character comes off as more gauche than a family's new mutt, who debuts by humping everyone's leg at an important dinner party. Any right-thinking household immediately would have such a nuisance pet fixed, which is what most GRASS IS GREENER viewers will be hoping for Hilary.

The answer is often the same for nuns. Although many today believe that anyone, no matter how poor, can become president or a doctor, there are still many others who think it isn't realistic to do that in one generation. For them the church offers much more interesting and rewarding jobs than the secular world. They don't become forceful, but they do become respected and consulted. As a project for a journalism class several people who had become priests or nuns were interviewed in order to find out why they did that. None gave the expected answer that they were called by the Holy Spirit. They were just poor people whose best opportunity for interesting work was offered them by the church. If in history rich families often considered it a blessing to give one child over to such work, that was not seen in the recent limited survey. Although none mentioned witnessing spiritual phenomena, it is often the case that people who have witnessed it avoid public discussion of it since it is usually not accepted or understood by the public. Although I believe the movie would work fine without the vile and disgusting language and recommend an edited for television version, there is a case made for its socially redeeming value. The movie paints a clear picture of the poverty that Karras left for his prestigious job in the church. It seems real priests and nuns have that much in common with the fiction.

I'm not rating this film based on the age of the film which is pushing 90 years old - I'm rating this film based on how good it is all the way around (acting, casting, script, special effects, cinematography, etc...) and the film is good.I've seen other films from around 1927 and Metropolis is one of the best films of that time era. The movie is one of the earliest films that I would call an Epic even though it might not be considered an Epic.Some people are tired of dystopian types of films - and that is OK but this is one of the earliest films in that category so it's a terrible reason to knock the film. Also if one does not like dystopian films then they simply need not watch them. Metropolis is set in a dystopian futuristic world so if you do not like these types of films then don't watch Metropolis; if you do like them then you might enjoy this movie.It is a silent film and one of the best silent films you will ever see. It is a top class classic movie for a reason.I am giving the film 7.5 stars because there are scenes that seem to drag on forever - very slow scenes that could have been filmed at a quicker pace.
