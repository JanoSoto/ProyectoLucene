Sean Connery is Robert MacDougal a jewel thief; Catherine Zeta-Jones is Virginia Gin Baker, an insurance investigator sent to capture him. As the movie evolves, it becomes apparent that not everything is what it seems. Entrapment is movie that people will enjoy since it keeps them on the edge of their seats and keeps them guessing whether or not certain characters are on the level. The plot includes trying to capture Robert MacDougal while he tries his hand at a theft of mask. The movie doesn't end there, not only does it have one robbery but there a two; the second is an offer by a mystery person who can only be revealed when it is seen. I liked how this movie dealt with other facets than just its main plot. Entrapment kept me guessing throughout to who might be on the level, wondering who might be the real thief. Along with the suspense, Entrapment includes underlying but clear sexual tension and chemistry between Connery and Zeta-Jones. I also loved Entrapment because it had a lot of high- tech gadgets used by Connery and Zeta-Jones; furthermore, I loved the way that they used them. There was one scene that I enjoyed to death and, which involved Catherine Zeta-Jones practicing her moves through security lasers. It is almost a fatherly love that Connery has for Zeta-Jones and it is proven in several scenes throughout the film. Entrapment also includes great support from its co-stars Will Patton and Ving Rhames. Patton and Rhames are so good it is difficult to tell whether or not they are part of a conspiracy to steal the mask or they are really tracking Connery and Zeta-Jones. Entrapment is a movie for people who like a good suspenseful thriller that really makes you think and does not have a resolution until the end; furthermore, it contains a surprise ending that will the audience will enjoy. Entrapment works for me because it shows me Sean Connery at his best and Catherine Zeta-Jones as a star on the rise. Entrapment deserves to be seen.

One can almost believe he was there in person and lived through those years in the 40's.Schindler's List works like magic on the screen. Of course the actors, Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes in particular are tremendous, but what really makes this one the milestone that it is, is the fact that it is shot entirely (except a couple of min. at the very start of it) in black and white. This makes the viewers completely captivated on what's going on on the screen. It's almost as if we are being held in a state of believing we are in the movie ourselves. No other movie I've seen can I say have made me feel that way. Steven Spielberg finally got the reviews and critics he deserved for Schindler's List. He is truly the greatest Director of today.

The story seems simple nearly everyone thinks it's a movie about running.  But there's so much more to it than that.  For every character in the movie, running accomplishes some goal.  Yet each character approaches running in a different way.  Eric Liddell, one of the two main characters, runs for God. 'When I run, I feel His pleasure,' he says, and as he runs, the viewer gets caught up in this belief.  I am not a religious person, but watching Eric run, I too feel pleasure.  Emotion swells up as he runs around the track. And how could it not, with Vangelis' brilliant soundtrack playing in the background? For Harold Abrahams, the other main character, running also has to do with religion, but Harold runs not to become closer to God but to combat the anti-Semitism he feels wherever he goes.  Harold is Jewish, and he runs to show the world that he can outrun anyone else. Great as the racing and training scenes are, what makes this movie memorable are the little touches.  Each character is a little miracle unto himself.  There are no weak links in the chain.  Watch this movie once, then watch it again.

The comraderie at the helm is balanced with a shark-like betting on one another's success \/ failure behind the back of whom ever is down.The rest of the film is centered around the occurrences when an over-achieving, enigmatic controller and his strange wife upset the balance of the group status quo with their odd ways.Billy Bob Thornton as Russell Bell makes the picture, with his character inspiring a curious reaction to everyone around him. Just when we thought he couldn't come up with another bizarre portrayal of a loner (Sling Blade, U-Turn, A Simple Plan), he does so brilliantly.  His dark mystery, his motorcycle, and his wife cause everyone to get curious, especially the Falzones, played by John Cusack and Cate Blanchett.Cusack acts exactly like he does in every film, and this is one storyline where it's appropriate.  Nick Falzone is stirred not only to wonder about Russell Bell and to compete with him, but to become obsessed with him.  I found this to be the strength of the film - a relationship so layered and full of mixed emotions that it brings the viewer discomfort at times.The first act is passable; it does it's job of setting up the premise, albeit with extra baggage, like the scene of the controllers eating breakfast and asking two women to sit with them - what was that for, other than to show that Falzone has a wandering eye?  It was unnecessary.The second act is the best - the relationship between the Falzone couple is warm, sexy, and believable.  Which makes it all the more upsetting to see their relationship get knocked off kilter by the presence of Russell Bell, and his drunken bombshell wife. Several of the subplots and twists challenge the willing suspension of disbelief, and possibly they could have been pared down to make the second act move along at a pace more indicative of the controller's job.  The film keeps everything from the Falzone's perspective, putting us in the same position as they are, watching the Bells but never seeing what is behind their weird, mysterious curtain.The final thirty minutes are difficult to analyze; I have read that there was a different, darker ending, and this makes sense.  The film's ending is like a rabbit running in front of a car in the dark, darting this way and that, not sure where to go or how to get out of the way.  Even the production values changed here; in one scene by a river the exposure is poor and the filmic quality is noticably different.While the ending was not a thrill, it was not a disappointment, and overall my biggest criticism is that the film could have easily been 40 minutes shorter without losing anything. If anything, the filmmakers could have added a scene or two developing the bizarre Russell Bell even further.It's understandable that some viewers have been disappointed with this film; however, it is worth seeing in the theatre, in my opinion, and will be remembered for its chemistry between the main four characters, and for its successful portrayal of the industry.

We have pretty much the entire script memorized and have found a whole bunch of odd things that happen during the show.Originally when I saw this at the age of 6 it disturbed me.  I had no idea or concept of the comedy, all I knew was that there were people getting killed and my parents were laughing about it.Then, about four years ago, my best friend bought a copy and we watched it. By the end of the movie we were in tears over Mrs. White's antics and the strange gravel-y voice of Eileen Brennan as Mrs. Peacock.

There's the protagonist who once lost  something to a huge mindless force of nature  and who has been obsessed (to put it mildly)  with getting revenge on it ever since.  There  is the protagonist's crew, who spend their days  scanning the horizon for any sign of the monster,  which inhabits a vast medium (the sea, the sky).  When they spot one, they set off in excited pursuit.   (You almost expect the crew in Twister to shout  Thar she blows!)  Their object is to catch the  monster.  The monsters are all big and brutal,  but there's a REALLY big, brutal one out there.   That's the one the protagonist is after.  There are some scenes in Twister that match  Moby Dick beat for beat.  Moby Dick The whale  disappears, leaving only its retinue of seabirds  whirling eerily over the water.  Where is it?  It's  right under us!  Twister  The tornado disapears,  leaving only its image whirling eerily on the radar.   Where is it?  It's right above us!Helen Hunt is Ahab, Bill Paxton is a cross between Ishmael and Starbuck.  The F5 is you-know-who.Over all, and despite the wonky science, Twister is a good movie.  It grabs your attention at the outset, and never lets go.  The only really bad part is Philip Seymour Hoffman's extremely annoying character, whose mouth you want to cover with duct tape.

The violence serves no point in the narrative other than saying these men are monsters.  We already know that after they kill the first person.This is no Tarantino film.  His violence is suspenseful, exciting and crucial his films' themes.  I'm sure he regrets putting money into this exercise.  Killing Zoe has no main themes either.  Zed is foreign to the country and to the group but that is the only reason I can think of as to why this was made in Paris.  It's not that I want a moral to the story but some themes that drive the characters and the story would be nice.Rent it for curiosity value only.

The second is that some are made into movies - which, by and large, haven't all been that well received. Apt Pupil, on the other hand, falls into a different category. Based on one of King's novellas, this little story translates quite well onto the big screen - helped out by fine acting and inspired  direction.Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a bright youth with a kinky mind who begins to suspect that a particularly heinous kind of evil resides in his white-bread suburban neighborhood. It turns out that one of the community's senior citizens, Kurt Dussander, is actually a Nazi war criminal. Instead of telling the authorities however, the boy decides to blackmail the old guy and, with Nuremberg-like zeal, he collects enough historic and forensic data to convince Dussander he knows his true identity. Then, perhaps motivated by an evil that lurks in his own heart, the kid proceeds to pump the ancient monster for detailed accounts of his atrocities.The disturbing relationship between old man and boy is compelling enough by itself to sustain our interest. But as the two begin to engage in a psychological dance of wills, we start to grasp that the stakes in this mind game may be higher than we first supposed. When the balance of power between the two begins to shift, Todd realizes that the price of the knowledge he seeks may be his very soul.Part of the film's chill is generated by director Bryan Singer's knack for showcasing a King trademark - the frightening juxtaposition of true evil with the seemingly prosaic quality of everyday life. With the additional support of a well-crafted screenplay, Singer maintains a surprising amount of tension throughout, with adept manipulation of scenes revealing the story's twists and turns. Credit for this also goes to the actors - McKellan's goose-stepping scene develops an especially goose-bumpy frisson, showing us the unspeakable evil lying behind his character's watery old eyes. And Renfro is both photogenic and effective as a disturbed adolescent with more brains then conscience.If there is a problem with Apt Pupil, it is that the film is mildly in love with itself - becoming especially drawn out near the end. Some might also find the ending a bit anticlimactic.Overall though, you won't be disappointed - and might even develop a tendency to gaze a bit longer than usual at the next old man you see on a bus.
