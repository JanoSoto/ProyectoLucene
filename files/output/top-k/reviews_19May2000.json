In one scene the child comes through the front door just home from school. Yet, it is dark outside the front door. The child in the film has a 6th sense but totally fails to use it on Willis. I don`t want to list other goofs because I don`t want to give away the plot but once you have seen it you will see them.In England Blockbuster video rental are giving cheap ice cream if you rent this title &#150; you can see why.

Unfortunately though, it turned out to be pretty much a nothing film.It dragged on and was pretty darn boring really.  Matt Damon didn't make me care about his character, in fact neither did any of the characters.  This was pretty darn bad as all the movie seemed to be was characterisation, with no action (and by that I mean any point in the movie where something interesting happened) in sight.It billed itself as a Drama\/Thriller.  I'd be far more inclined to go with a Confused\/Attempt\/At\/Drama.  I can't see there was anything much thrilling about it at all.One thing that really bugged me above all else though.  Italy is a big place, given it's not as big as the USA, but does that really mean that everyone bumps into each other where-ever they go?  Even so far as the boat trip back to America, is there only one boat that every single person uses at exactly the same time?In summary, I found this to be an out-and-out boring film.  Characterisation is fine, but I watch a film for entertainment\/suspense\/action\/to be moved, etc., not to get to know a character intimately and still not care about them at all!  The acting from Matt Damon was poor at very best.  The others weren't so bad, but weren't all that good either.  I definitely wouldn't recommend it as one to watch.

His performance sadly overcomes the performances of other actors in key roles, but this for me did not present a problem, as I viewed the film as being very lead role centric, anyway.Although compared to the book the gore factor was downplayed in the movie, it was depicted in a way that conveyed well the essence of Bateman's character yet kept the movie in a class that doesn't end up being raped by censors.All in all, I was very pleased by the adaptation, and can even recommend it to anyone not having read the book itself as a truly chilling horror comedy \/ satire.
