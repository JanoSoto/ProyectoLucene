While he is in there he finds out that he can turn illness into humor. So he leaves the hospital to be a doctor. I like the turning the movie takes, because it show that if you want something you can achieve it. The period after he starts on Virgina medical University to become a doctor, is a turning point for Patch, you can see that he is struggling with different issues. Having a roommate who does not like him, and chasing after a girl named Carin, who does not show him any affection in the beginning. It gives a good insight in the reality, that you don't get everything in the beginning.I love the part where he is fooling around in the hospital, to make children happy. you can see that he is committed to what he does. He meets a lot of resistance from the dean, but it does not knocks him out. He fights for it. I also really like the part where he gets the house and start the Gesundheit institute, his dream is starting to be a realize. I also like the passion that occurs between Patch and Carin, the passion that goes from no affection, to totally affection is lovely to see, you can see how Carin gives herself to Patch, and that is very touching to see. You can see that they really love each other. Robin Williams acting in this movie is marvelous. He plays the role so amazing, I felt captured from the start to the beginning.

Would you like to have one at home? Chris Columbus gives his own answers to these questions in the film Bicentennial Man. This film is based on a book, written by Isaak Azimov, who is famous for his stories about robots. The topics which the film brings up, are simple and clear even for a child. But it doesn't mean that the story itself is simple, the other way round, the story tells us about things which are considered to be the main morality, love, family. We cannot but feel all the emotions which are expressed in the film, because all of them are quite familiar to us. The story of a robot who spent 200 years to become a simple man seems to be very strange in some way. Many people would give everything to be immortal, but not Andrew. For me, this robot is more humane then any human and through the entire story I waited for him to understand it and accept himself. The actor, who played the main part, is Robbin Williams. His portrayal of a robot can be called even genial. Every scene, where he appeared, is full of humour, charm and positive. This is one of my favorite actors because of his ability to express different emotions with his eyes and smile and this film can serve as a perfect example. Another thing I like about this film is music. It helps us to feel all the emotions, to understand characters. I think here I can say only one name to make everything clear. Celine Dion. Her song is perfect for this film and now it is one of my favorite. You know, I'm always skeptical t the films about future, it always seem artificial or exaggerated, but Bicentennial Man is a different one. Being a sci-fi this film, it tells us a story of a man, of his dreams, and for me it is more drama, then film about robots. Of course, there are no sufferings or complicated lives, everything is quite simple, but it makes this film suitable for everyone.

It has managed to stay on top as one of the best, iconic high school films of all time to this day, tackling the rebellion of youth, and social problems still faced today. Why? Because it so accurately portrays the life of teenagers. Capturing the classic stereotypes of the brain, the athlete, the basket case, the princess and the criminal. But through this film, you see who they really are, that they are not just stereotypes, they all have problems in their lives and hardships. It proves that we all hide behind these masks, or personas, we feel that's all we can be, and we can't step out of that box, and be with other, different people or who we really are. Anyone who has made it through high school and lived to tell the tale, can relate to this movie, feel their pain, laugh, cry; cause really, aren't we all hiding behind these masks placed on us by society. One of my favourite lines of all time, is when you grow up, your heart dies, from Allison (the basket case), as the group frets about turning out like their parents, which by the end of the film, the group reluctantly defies that fate. Their principle, Vernon, is also portrayed as the classic, hard-ass authority figure. But is he really a bad guy? It is revealed half way through the film during a conversation between Vernon, and the janitor (the eyes and ears of the school), that it's not the kids who have changed, it's him. Abuse of authority comes as no surprise, and you can see clearly through Vernon's character that's exactly what's happened. Personally I think, he isn't a bad guy, underneath his hard exterior, but that is in fact what he has become, and perceived as by the students. In conclusion, the Breakfast Club will live on in our hearts for a long long time.

This film is widely considered to be a comedy movie, the very one that you can watch with your family seating in front of the TV-set and eating pop-corn. Looking more deeply, I think it can be named drama as well as comedy. This film is unusually harmonious in spite of the fact that we are shown a very technological and affluent society in future with all those magnetically levitated trains,personal robots and smart systems surrounding people. Moreover, future in this film does not seem to be scaring. When you watch this particular film you simply plunge into the world of future that gives you so many philosophic topics to think over. So the plot is rather thought-provoking. A robot that is supposed to be responsible for household chores and carry out orders of members of the Martin family turned out to possess human emotions and even art abilities. While the story progresses Andrew, the robot, gets more and more human features. Sometimes you can even find him more humane and emotional then people. The main character Andrew is unique, it was said in the film a number of times. He is a robot with a human soul, sensitive to other people and the world itself. During two centuries of his life he faces a lot of problems starting from people's misunderstanding and continuing to loneliness and despair of a lover. This role was brilliantly played by Robin Williams. As a true fan of Robin William I am sure to say that this is one of his best roles. I really appreciate his talent and I think anyone would feel the same feeling watching this film. The acting is astonishing. In the first part of the film he managed to reveal the character of Martin without being able to show his mimicry. I was able to understand the emotions clearly and become involved into the atmosphere of the film. I can't mention the other actors. On the whole, I can say, they were cast approximately. Their acting was quite convincing. But Hallie Kate Eisenberg, the girl that played Little Miss Amanda, is my favorite in this film. I wonder, how it was possible for a little girl to reveal the character so perfectly. The thing I not quite satisfied with is special effects. It seems, that in a movie about future we need more details about technology to plunge into the atmosphere fully. In the first part of the film almost all event took place in the Martin's house. I wonder, why not show us something interesting about the future. So the beginning was rather boring and tedious. Though the proper acting saved the beginning. Nevertheless, the messages of this film play the most important role. While watching the film, many philosophic topics come to our mind, such as love, friendship, humanism, death, sense of life and many other. This film helps people to think a little about their life, about their relationships with the world and with their close people. After watching the film, I couldn't even talk, because I was so much impressed by it. I thought about the future, it doesn't scare me if we talk about technology. The thing I'm worried about is the human nature of people. I think a lot of people no longer take care of others. They think about themselves only, there is too much ego in their life. I wish it changed. I strongly recommend everyone to watch Bicentennial Man. It is certainly one of the best ways to spend your time. I hope, the film will make you think your life over and start to change our future from now.

While the story progresses Andrew, the robot, gets more and more human features. Sometimes you can even find him more humane and emotional then people. The main character Andrew is unique, it was said in the film a number of times. He is a robot with a human soul, sensitive to other people and the world itself. During two centuries of his life he faces a lot of problems starting from people's misunderstanding and continuing to loneliness and despair of a lover. This role was brilliantly played by Robin Williams. As a true fan of Robin William I am sure to say that this is one of his best roles. I really appreciate his talent and I think anyone would feel the same feeling watching this film. The acting is astonishing. In the first part of the film he managed to reveal the character of Martin without being able to show his mimicry. I was able to understand the emotions clearly and become involved into the atmosphere of the film. I can't mention the other actors. On the whole, I can say, they were cast approximately. Their acting was quite convincing. But Hallie Kate Eisenberg, the girl that played Little Miss Amanda, is my favorite in this film. I wonder, how it was possible for a little girl to reveal the character so perfectly. The thing I not quite satisfied with is special effects. It seems, that in a movie about future we need more details about technology to plunge into the atmosphere fully. In the first part of the film almost all event took place in the Martin's house. I wonder, why not show us something interesting about the future. So the beginning was rather boring and tedious. Though the proper acting saved the beginning. Nevertheless, the messages of this film play the most important role. While watching the film, many philosophic topics come to our mind, such as love, friendship, humanism, death, sense of life and many other. This film helps people to think a little about their life, about their relationships with the world and with their close people. After watching the film, I couldn't even talk, because I was so much impressed by it. I thought about the future, it doesn't scare me if we talk about technology. The thing I'm worried about is the human nature of people. I think a lot of people no longer take care of others. They think about themselves only, there is too much ego in their life. I wish it changed. I strongly recommend everyone to watch Bicentennial Man. It is certainly one of the best ways to spend your time. I hope, the film will make you think your life over and start to change our future from now.

It is a wonderful movie continuing the story a total worth of time. It is an OK movie for me. Here are the reason why is my at least favorite Rocky film He earns a little money spends all what he earned, he stinks at the commercials, he can't read, he can't get a job, he is not allowed to fight anymore because Adrian is so selfish and doesn't let him. She is not trying to protect him, she is so selfish and she doesn't want him to fight. She is putting him down. Apollo Creed keeps insulting Rocky, Rocky starts working in the gym and he keeps getting humiliated him self twice. Once in the commercials and second in the gym. The first hour is getting boring and slowly goes , the second hour is paced when he starts training the rest sucks. He doesn't train hard over guilt of Adrian than she falls into coma and he doesn't train anymore. I am wondering how he even lasted 15.rounds and won the title if he stopped training. Everything that Apollo cared in this movie was to get a revenge. This movie is not inspiring it is a good sequel but it is just not inspiring. Rocky becomes a janitor in Mick's gym, Apollo keeps insulting Rocky with words like APOLLO CREED vs. THE Italian CHICKEN, with a cartoon picture of Creed grabbing and choking a Rocky-headed chicken. People from the gym was laughing at Rocky and he just ignored them. Adrian put down Rocky, even Mick put him down. Rocky asked him to train him again and Mick reject and put him down. Creed would have caved in the whole side of your face. Now, forget it, kid. You got the heart, but you ain't got the tools no more. Tool's no more? Rocky has a heart so stop putting him down. Apollo and his guy were keep insulting him with a bum.Mick keeps insulting him, finally against Adrian's will Rocky accept the fight, but he starts training over Adrian's quilt and than he quit training. Adrian fall's in come and he stop training that is stupid! He wanted to gave up Everything for Adrian! Trough whole film there are no boxing matches or any boxing fights, only the rematch between Rocky and Apollo that's it. In all Rocky's there are more boxing matches than one, in this we see only one fight. On the commercials the director keeps insulting Rocky because he can not read. He get's fired from his job as a meat packer. I am sorry people but Rocky II is my at least favorite sport drama film. Too much drama in it, slow pacing and field with boredom.Things I do like in the film I love the training and fight sequences. I love the music score by Bill Conti - Overture, the music that Bill Conti wrote was perfect and they fit to the film. I love the opening scene when, the story picks up where the first movie left off. Rocky goes to a hospital after his fight with Apollo and Apollo demands a rematch. I love the hospital scene, I really love how Rocky is praising Apollo and him, saying they both did great. The last fight between Rocky and Apollo was filed with heart. Stallone did not insult Carl Weathers character but he made both of the characters an equal opponents and Apollo lost for one second the title. The fight for the world champion ship was awesome. I love how Rocky was struggling and was trying to find a job, I love that. I love one man's real life human's drama portraying on screen. I love how Mick was training him. I love his methods of training. I love that film is set in the 70's and I love Apollo training sequences. I also love how Tony Duke motivated Apollo in the ring. I also love that no one dies in this movie and Rocky wins the title the champion of the whole world on the end of the movie.The are a lot of moments I love in this film and a lot of moments I despise and I don't like in this movie.In the aftermath of his bout with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) attempts to lead a peaceful life with his new bride, Adrian (Talia Shire). The fame and fortune from the match soon runs scarce and to make ends meet, Rocky agrees to a re-match with Apollo.That is the main plot.

I was more into Jackie Chan movies (I still love Jackie Chan's movies from the 80's. A lot.), so I thought Bruce Lee was wooden and I didn't think he was as skilled as Jackie Chan. But the older I got, the more I got fond of Bruce Lee movies and Bruce Lee himself. What I realized was what Bruce did in his movies were something that only a very few could match. He had charisma, great martial arts skills, great acting skills and one of the few actors who had an in your face performance. Many actors have tried to match him but they often got comical instead of intense as Bruce did. This movie is a real gem and it is underrated compared to 'Enter the Dragon' and I like 'Way of the Dragon' more since I feel you could feel more of Bruce and his philosophy here. I feel what he tried to communicate in this movie was more important than his previous and later martial arts movies.Now the movie itself it is made with a low budget so don't expect great production value. The script is good and actually well thought out, the fight scenes are still among the best I've seen and it has a bit of Bruce's humor here. It is not as big as 'Fist of Fury', meaning it is a bit more (if not a lot) realistic. Tang Lung (the main character) didn't fight 20+ martial artists at once, which in my opinion made the movie great since it wasn't exaggerated. It was humble in that sense. The fight scenes are much more realistic than most movies and more simpler so it is more down to earth than the other martial arts movies he's been in, less fantastic. Which in my opinion makes the movie better than most action movies. The acting in the movie was sufficient for me, but it is mostly due to the bad English dubbing the acting seemed unnatural.

I was more into Jackie Chan movies (I still love Jackie Chan's movies from the 80's. A lot.), so I thought Bruce Lee was wooden and I didn't think he was as skilled as Jackie Chan. But the older I got, the more I got fond of Bruce Lee movies and Bruce Lee himself. What I realized was what Bruce did in his movies were something that only a very few could match. He had charisma, great martial arts skills, great acting skills and one of the few actors who had an in your face performance. Many actors have tried to match him but they often got comical instead of intense as Bruce did. This movie is a real gem and it is underrated compared to 'Enter the Dragon' and I like 'Way of the Dragon' more since I feel you could feel more of Bruce and his philosophy here. I feel what he tried to communicate in this movie was more important than his previous and later martial arts movies.Now the movie itself it is made with a low budget so don't expect great production value. The script is good and actually well thought out, the fight scenes are still among the best I've seen and it has a bit of Bruce's humor here. It is not as big as 'Fist of Fury', meaning it is a bit more (if not a lot) realistic. Tang Lung (the main character) didn't fight 20+ martial artists at once, which in my opinion made the movie great since it wasn't exaggerated. It was humble in that sense. The fight scenes are much more realistic than most movies and more simpler so it is more down to earth than the other martial arts movies he's been in, less fantastic. Which in my opinion makes the movie better than most action movies. The acting in the movie was sufficient for me, but it is mostly due to the bad English dubbing the acting seemed unnatural.

It is not even a sport film to me! It is a sad satire story! What the hell happened in here? Rocky IV was such a Entraining Action sport film, this is a disaster and over long boring train wreck! It is just not the Rocky we grew up with it. This movie can't compare to the past Rocky movies. It seems to take everything Rocky worked hard for and throw it out the window. He loses all his money and he also seems to forget he has a son, even though that was a big event in Rocky II. Also, why is his son like 10 years older that he was in Rocky IV, wasn't Rocky only gone for a few months. Rocky quitting boxing, he suffered from brain damage I just hate that. Again I also had a major problem with Adrian's character. The same that I was angry on her in Rocky II for not been supportive, here is she even worse than ever! She was a completely different person and her chemistry with Rocky did not show in this movie. In Rocky V she suddenly becomes very assertive, even when dealing with the press and in public situations. This is totally contrary to the reserved, shy character we had known previously. I think this change in character was a big reason the chemistry between her and Rocky did not work.Then we get to Rocky V, and find that because of his incredibly stupid brother in law, Rocky ends up completely broke and destitute, ending right back where he started in his old neighborhood. As if it were all for nothing. Who really wants to see a study of a hero's fall into depravity? I don't. Ending the series at Rocky IV would have been the best decision. The things I liked in the movie was the opening scene, showing his match from Rocky IV and shows him in the Russia Moscow still showering and than he can't stop shaking his hands. I love the Rocky, Paulie attending press conference. I love that Rocky moves to a working-class Philadelphia neighborhood where he grew up as child. I love how Rocky Balboa Jr. fights off of two bullies and starts training by uncle Paulie I love that. Until he face them and fight's back, I love that scene. I love Elisebeth Peters as Jewel, Robert's Girlfriend she was so beautiful in the film. What happened to the actress who played Jewel where did she went?. I think the script and the changes of the fifth installment just really hurt the film so much. It is just a poor sad story of a depressed Drama that is just not Rocky! Anyway, I don't want to write anymore and leaving any more spoilers in here, and I don't want to insult the film, because I love Rocky. One last thing even Sylvester Stallone agrees that film is awful, the producers even wanted to kill the Rocky character off. Sly was very disappointed with the film's release and he waited 16. years until he made a successful sequel Rocky Balboa a big improvement over Rocky V.

There are some truths and some lies. The biggest truth is Isaac's love for the city, something that even passing time cannot erode - he intends to immortalise it in Willis' stunning black and white photography that captures a distant past, a nostalgic version of the skyscrapers, the ferries, the butcheries, the snowy parks, and of course the iconic shot of the Queensboro Bridge twinkling and silhouetting what seems to be a lovestruck pair. And then he is exaggerating in some instances; he maintains that he and will still have the coiled sexual power of a jungle cat even in his 70s, and remarks if there is anyone that he models himself after it is god. However when it comes time to break up with the 17 year-old Tracy, he subtly deflects the doe-eyed interrogation of love into an act for her own good - now he is 42, miserable, and his hair is falling out. He is self-righteous, but not on the same level of pretentiousness as Yale or Mary, who pride themselves in their 'Academy of Overrated' and disparage great artists from all areas. Watch how they and Isaac spar - well not spar, they laugh and snicker, while Isaac adamantly refuses their every suggestion. But one line from his ex-wife's memoir of their disastrous marriage seems to suggest he is not so different (and the group laugh out loud at this reading, but as ElMaruecan82 points out, Tracy would never have done so, and I agree); as much as he seems to despise these pseudo-intellectual New Yorkers, he chases eagerly after one and only succeeds in doing so on account of being one himself. He is disillusioned with his successful comedy show, so he quits without really thinking just how much of a downgrade he will have to suffer in his lifestyle - what is more important, his integrity, or the colour of his tap water? He complains at length about it, and in the next scene the cameras tracks him as he walks over to hand a crystal clear glass of water to Mary, but we already knew that it was her. He adjusts his personality depending on who he is trying to woo. He is also hypocritical. Watch how two grown men argue and bicker over a grown women like she is a toy. Yale spits out that he saw her first. Isaac is clearly bitter about being cheated on despite doing the same to Tracy. Yale childishly retaliates later and lies to his wife, solely pushing the blame on his dear friend. Earlier, they unexpectedly bump into Mary's ex-husband, and Isaac is pushed swiftly out of the frame, but it matters not, because Wallace Shawn as Jeremiah is his spitting image, middle-aged, balding, short (it's even suggested he used to be overweight). Isaac marvels that a man that looks like that could ever be a dominating, devastating sexual partner - but of course, he's assigned these roles to himself.Mariel Hemingway is Tracy, the 17 year old girlfriend, and hers is perhaps the best performance of them of all, quiet, assured, straight faced. It is a testament to her ability that I find myself with troubling thoughts, never once wondering about her attraction to the older Isaac, but questioning over and over how he managed to get her. This is the mindset of Isaac, who manages to convince himself and her that she is youthful beyond her pretty face, that she is inexperienced and precocious, that she has many lovers ahead, and that she does not yet know what love is. In short, that she is uncorrupted. Watch his little sly smile as Tracy answers I go to high school, clearly out of her element, and he loves this about her.

Willis frames the two close yet far apart in the stylish apartment, distant, as he once again lectures her on how to approach this relationship that seems a dying cause. She makes a joke about how little he thinks of her knowledge of the arts, and we cut away before he can respond, but we know it is a dismissive one. They take a horse drawn carriage through the glittering nightime skyline, and Isaac dubs the experience corny, saying he's done it all before as a kid, but deep down he treasures this little memory, and thinks himself lucky to be able to do it again with such a beautiful girl. He finally comes to his senses in the final scene. Once again we start with a voice-over, which quickly turns into something more immediate and genuine - he is not attempting to wittily open his biography, but quietly recording himself musing over life's wonders.

He runs her down, perhaps one of the first instances of this romantic comedy type confession. But here, although it is sincere (the most he has been the entire movie), it is also selfish, and he is sabotaging all his previous arguments and insistence on her naivety and youthfulness and boundless opportunities, but if he can have her again, it does not matter.

However when it comes time to break up with the 17 year-old Tracy, he subtly deflects the doe-eyed interrogation of love into an act for her own good - now he is 42, miserable, and his hair is falling out. He is self-righteous, but not on the same level of pretentiousness as Yale or Mary, who pride themselves in their 'Academy of Overrated' and disparage great artists from all areas. Watch how they and Isaac spar - well not spar, they laugh and snicker, while Isaac adamantly refuses their every suggestion. But one line from his ex-wife's memoir of their disastrous marriage seems to suggest he is not so different (and the group laugh out loud at this reading, but as ElMaruecan82 points out, Tracy would never have done so, and I agree); as much as he seems to despise these pseudo-intellectual New Yorkers, he chases eagerly after one and only succeeds in doing so on account of being one himself. He is disillusioned with his successful comedy show, so he quits without really thinking just how much of a downgrade he will have to suffer in his lifestyle - what is more important, his integrity, or the colour of his tap water? He complains at length about it, and in the next scene the cameras tracks him as he walks over to hand a crystal clear glass of water to Mary, but we already knew that it was her. He adjusts his personality depending on who he is trying to woo. He is also hypocritical. Watch how two grown men argue and bicker over a grown women like she is a toy. Yale spits out that he saw her first. Isaac is clearly bitter about being cheated on despite doing the same to Tracy. Yale childishly retaliates later and lies to his wife, solely pushing the blame on his dear friend. Earlier, they unexpectedly bump into Mary's ex-husband, and Isaac is pushed swiftly out of the frame, but it matters not, because Wallace Shawn as Jeremiah is his spitting image, middle-aged, balding, short (it's even suggested he used to be overweight). Isaac marvels that a man that looks like that could ever be a dominating, devastating sexual partner - but of course, he's assigned these roles to himself.Mariel Hemingway is Tracy, the 17 year old girlfriend, and hers is perhaps the best performance of them of all, quiet, assured, straight faced. It is a testament to her ability that I find myself with troubling thoughts, never once wondering about her attraction to the older Isaac, but questioning over and over how he managed to get her. This is the mindset of Isaac, who manages to convince himself and her that she is youthful beyond her pretty face, that she is inexperienced and precocious, that she has many lovers ahead, and that she does not yet know what love is. In short, that she is uncorrupted. Watch his little sly smile as Tracy answers I go to high school, clearly out of her element, and he loves this about her. He is babying her, but indulging in it at the same time. Willis frames the two close yet far apart in the stylish apartment, distant, as he once again lectures her on how to approach this relationship that seems a dying cause. She makes a joke about how little he thinks of her knowledge of the arts, and we cut away before he can respond, but we know it is a dismissive one. They take a horse drawn carriage through the glittering nightime skyline, and Isaac dubs the experience corny, saying he's done it all before as a kid, but deep down he treasures this little memory, and thinks himself lucky to be able to do it again with such a beautiful girl. He finally comes to his senses in the final scene. Once again we start with a voice-over, which quickly turns into something more immediate and genuine - he is not attempting to wittily open his biography, but quietly recording himself musing over life's wonders. Music (most of all Gershin, who serenades throughout), cinema, good food, and then he fixates on Tracy's face. He runs her down, perhaps one of the first instances of this romantic comedy type confession. But here, although it is sincere (the most he has been the entire movie), it is also selfish, and he is sabotaging all his previous arguments and insistence on her naivety and youthfulness and boundless opportunities, but if he can have her again, it does not matter. He pleads for her to not get corrupted, while she insists it is just a few months. Who is the kid here?

Several films such as Scarface, The Godfather Part 2, Bonnie and Clyde, and Pulp Fiction are rivals to that movie. To me, Goodfellas definitely ranks very high up there. I love both The Godfather and Goodfellas and I think that both films are masterpieces.This movie follows infamous gangster Henry Hill and his friends as they work their way up in the gangster world. It shows different people and different events he encounters in this film.I just want to start off this review by saying that this movie is incredibly entertaining. It keeps the movie going at an enjoyable pace and it makes the movie very easy to follow. The movie even draws you in right at the beginning with its brilliant opening scene which is now iconic.By far, Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) is my favorite character in this movie. He is threatening and he seems like the kind of guy that you don't want to mess with. He can lose his temper very easily and if someone annoys him even in the slightest way possible, they risk getting themselves shot and killed. The infamous Funny How? scene near the beginning is definitely one of the most tense scenes in all of cinema history. The audience is left wondering if he'll pop and the silence of the scene makes it more tense. In other words, he basically steals the show.Ray Liotta also gave a fantastic role as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a feeling of innocence all while having a feeling of violence to him. He also loses his temper easily and when he does, those scenes stick with you very long after viewing it.Also, Robert De Niro gave a great performance. Robert De Niro has always been one of if not my favorite actor of all time. I like him for his tough guy roles. In my opinion, his performances in Taxi Driver and Raging Bull are some of the best performances ever in cinema. He gave another phenomenal performance in this movie as well even though he's not in the movie as much as you'd expect him to be based on the DVD cover.This movie is based on the true story of Henry Hill and it is adapted from the best-selling book Wiseguy. The book is great but the movie blows it out of the water in every way imaginable. Also, Henry Hill himself actually stated that this movie is about 95% accurate.Also, the movie is very stylish with its dazzling cinematography. The cinematography looks so good mainly because of the lighting and realistic set design in it. On top of that, Scorsese's Copa Cabana shot is a fabulous shot and it has a lot going for it in terms of the long take.In conclusion, this movie hits all the right notes and it is contains everything which I think is mandatory in gangster films. It is easy to follow, it has enjoyable pacing, great acting, and memorable characters. This film is definitely a masterpiece and it definitely ranks up there with some of the best movies ever made.

The film opens with visions of a man walking through a field trying to get to his family on the other side. But we are soon whisked away from the serenity of the farm and into the harsh reality of a battlefield. Here, we meet Maximus (Russell Crowe) who is the well respected general of the Roman army.

From this point on the story unfolds into one of action, manipulation, trust, and dignity. The moral of the story starts to unveil itself throughout the story and even makes you question how you're living your own life. Overall the movie is one that pulls at the heart and though it is somewhat lengthy running at 2 hours and 35 minutes, it is definitely worth watching fully. Scott brings the glory of Rome to life through this movie, with the help of a little CGI of course.

Shawshank. Gump. The Lion King. If someone came up to me and started ranting about how this was the best cinematic year ever, I'd actually listen to them for awhile before asking them why they are getting in my face. Of those films, this and Shawshank stand out, because they were not pre-established blockbusters. Gump and Lion King were expected to be pretty big, and just turned out bigger than anyone could possibly imagine. But these films were smaller, more personal projects. They are also quite different from each other in almost every other way; a notable one being that while Shawshank barely made back its budget at the box office, this film took off. Over the last couple weeks, with Steve Jobs and the like, we have examples of platforming failing. But it can succeed this film is a prime example of that.This is important not just if you're incurably a nut about these sort of things, like am I. It means that this is the first exposure a lot of people had with a Tarantino film. I bet a lot of people became fans for life at some random matinée screenings some cloudy Tuesdays. This is one of those films that I would have loved to be there at one of its early screenings. A lot of minds were opened those days.I hope I'm not overselling this film, but it is one of those films that is so great that it is nearly impossible to oversell, which is a positive for me, as I love my gushing descriptions, as you might be able to tell if you read my review of Mad Max Fury Road.One thing that must be noted about this film is that it goes out of order, and not a semi-organized out of order like Memento. This does not make the film hard to follow- it is easier to follow than Memento, at any rate- but it does make you think on your feet. Sometimes, I think that this whole movie is a then-young Mr. Tarantino taking a hunk of dynamite to the usual three-act structure. And it is glorious. No film better encapsulates the rush of exciting new filmmakers that we had in the 90s than this one.The title describes this film so well. It's not based on the style of blockbuster films. This isn't Jaws or Indiana Jones. This is darker, dirtier, less-universally subject matter. This is the equivalent of those books you keep for a trip to the doctor's office or the DMV just so you can be pulled out of the doldrums of life. It's not trying to be one of those Great American Novels written by Fitzgerald or Steinbeck that is typically only read by 'normal people' when they are in an English class or when they feel particularly scholarly.Of course, most of those novels were not particularly good, even at being what they are. This film is. It's clever, action-packed, well-written, and so much more. It represents a stark change from the happy-go-lucky (sometimes), subtle (often), and averse from breaking new ground (usually) attitudes of eighties movies and holds up a banner for nineties film. In the nineties, the same techniques that were developed for dark and gritty and serious movies like The Godfather or Apocalypse Now were being played apart the fabric of the mainstream. Yes, kids movies got even cheesier and less legit. But they no longer defined the market like they did in the prior decade.Artistic exploration became the norm. And few did that more than Mr. Tarantino, particularly in this film. Yes, if pulp fiction is what people expected, pulp fiction is what they got. But they did not get it in the way that they expected. To once more go back to MMFR, I'm willing to be there were people who went into that film expecting to see just another action film in the style of the dime-a-dozen Die Hard and James Bond knock-offs that pop up so often every year. Their experience with that movie is probably on the level as anyone who came into this film expecting to see a mere piece of pulp fiction. This film is not a part of that 'genre', if you can call it that, but both an homage to it and its leading light. It transcends its grounds, its place in time, and perhaps even the medium of film itself. It is pure artistry.I cannot exaggerate how much of a breath of fresh air this was. Pretty much every problem with film in the eighties was given an antidote. It's also a good cure for everything from with major filmmaking today, though I argue that a more artsy version of the Hunger Games series would be a better one. But that's just me.As you might expect from a film that took off like this, it launched several careers and revived others, including that of John Travolta, who for once uses his overacting to his advantage. The soundtrack, of course, is phenomenal and iconic. Enough so that when I wrote the words Pulp Fiction down on the page, the first thing that popped into my mind was the title theme (Misirlou as covered by Dick Dale and the Daletones, in case you were wondering).Above all, when I watched this film, I felt a love for film and artistry, as well as a desire to build upon the works of the past while making a unique mark.

Sometimes, I think that this whole movie is a then-young Mr. Tarantino taking a hunk of dynamite to the usual three-act structure. And it is glorious. No film better encapsulates the rush of exciting new filmmakers that we had in the 90s than this one.The title describes this film so well. It's not based on the style of blockbuster films. This isn't Jaws or Indiana Jones. This is darker, dirtier, less-universally subject matter. This is the equivalent of those books you keep for a trip to the doctor's office or the DMV just so you can be pulled out of the doldrums of life. It's not trying to be one of those Great American Novels written by Fitzgerald or Steinbeck that is typically only read by 'normal people' when they are in an English class or when they feel particularly scholarly.Of course, most of those novels were not particularly good, even at being what they are. This film is. It's clever, action-packed, well-written, and so much more. It represents a stark change from the happy-go-lucky (sometimes), subtle (often), and averse from breaking new ground (usually) attitudes of eighties movies and holds up a banner for nineties film. In the nineties, the same techniques that were developed for dark and gritty and serious movies like The Godfather or Apocalypse Now were being played apart the fabric of the mainstream. Yes, kids movies got even cheesier and less legit. But they no longer defined the market like they did in the prior decade.Artistic exploration became the norm. And few did that more than Mr. Tarantino, particularly in this film. Yes, if pulp fiction is what people expected, pulp fiction is what they got. But they did not get it in the way that they expected. To once more go back to MMFR, I'm willing to be there were people who went into that film expecting to see just another action film in the style of the dime-a-dozen Die Hard and James Bond knock-offs that pop up so often every year. Their experience with that movie is probably on the level as anyone who came into this film expecting to see a mere piece of pulp fiction. This film is not a part of that 'genre', if you can call it that, but both an homage to it and its leading light. It transcends its grounds, its place in time, and perhaps even the medium of film itself. It is pure artistry.I cannot exaggerate how much of a breath of fresh air this was. Pretty much every problem with film in the eighties was given an antidote. It's also a good cure for everything from with major filmmaking today, though I argue that a more artsy version of the Hunger Games series would be a better one. But that's just me.As you might expect from a film that took off like this, it launched several careers and revived others, including that of John Travolta, who for once uses his overacting to his advantage. The soundtrack, of course, is phenomenal and iconic. Enough so that when I wrote the words Pulp Fiction down on the page, the first thing that popped into my mind was the title theme (Misirlou as covered by Dick Dale and the Daletones, in case you were wondering).Above all, when I watched this film, I felt a love for film and artistry, as well as a desire to build upon the works of the past while making a unique mark. It enraptures you in itself. Honestly, I'm kinda surprised that it took off like it did back then. But I'm not surprised that it's remembered today. It holds a unique place in society and is one of the definitive 90s films. Enjoy.

There's a lot going on in this film as we visit three time periods - future, alternate present and past again - and as a result its hard to pin down a single story like in the first or third films. The future storyline struggles to find purpose given Doc's repeated insistence that the future must not be meddled with. That being said its essential for the movie and its so much fun to watch 2015, both as a prediction over the last 30 years and as a bit of humour from now on. Its startling how accurate some things are - Skype, 3D films - while others are a great source of humour. I never realised until this watching that both Marty's son AND daughter are played by Fox. Production design does a great job being funny whilst also conceivable, but the film's makeup is absolutely appalling. If you're going to make Lea Thompson put on that stupid voice and cake her under 100 feet of makeup, just get a different actress. Michael J. Fox as future Marty looks like Bride of Chucky. A man comes up to Marty to ask to save the clock tower and he's clearly caked in makeup, but why? He's no recognisable character after all, they could've just got any old man. Thomas Wilson plays the utterly unbearable Griff, who feels the need to shriek every word like a mental werewolf android. Not a whole lot goes on here and we quickly get out so that the film can set up the dystopian alternate reality.In alternate 1985, Biff has stolen the DeLorean and made himself rich. This is the best plot line that Gale could ever have come up with, because who among us hasn't wished we could do that? Rick Carter and his team create a twisted and brilliant dystopian 1985, and Thomas F. Wilson is exceptional as the evil billionaire Biff. Doc quickly figures out what happened and explains to the audience in a way that is not overly expository because thanks to Lloyd's consistently wacky performance, it is actually a fun scene to watch. Finally we get back to 1955 where the film plays out. Marty and Doc need to get back everything while not tampering with the past AND avoiding their selves from the first movie. This is by far the best part of this movie. Zemeckis blows my mind when constructing scenes that have two Michael J. Foxs noticeably on screen, because it doesn't for a moment look like they've done it with cheap effects. Zemeckis creates an aura of crises by constantly throwing obstacles into Marty's way, so you'll watch Marty's quest for the Almanac on the edge of your seat. The film finishes with one of the most famous cliffhangers and utterly delightful conclusions I've ever seen. Michael J. Fox is older and a bit less enthusiastic about being this wacky kid again, but Marty is such a lovable character that it doesn't matter too much. I always get cheap entertainment out of the whole are you chicken thing with McFly that was introduced in this film, but objectively its stupid. Lloyd is just as good as in the first film, every bit the wacky mad scientist in his voice, demeanour and even posture. Elisabeth Shue is irrelevant as Jennifer, who is included in the film because Gale and Zemeckis made the mistake of taking her with them at the end of the first, but Thomas F. Wilson is delightful as the various Biffs throughout time. Not many people could play a character as a teen, a tycoon and an old codger with equal conviction.Back to the Future 2 has lots of omages to classic scenes in the first, but none of them feel forced or tacky - there's something delightful about watching Marty flee on a hoverboard instead of a skateboard. Its a great and worthy sequel and a heap of fun to watch.

Here is where the insanity all kicked off and in mediocre fashion, how this spawned so many sequels I'll never know although financially this was a massive success though. The film is about a new law where basically anyone can apply to be a Police Officer and go through training in the academy. Of course the law brings in many wacky people and those who don't even want to be there because they have to go, the film thrives on creating oddballs but really fails to get a lot of decent jokes out, squandering any chances this had at being at least satisfactory.The film stars people such as Steve Guttenberg, Kim Cattrall, Bubba Smith and for me and I think for many others the best person in this, Michael Winslow. Although the character of Cadet Eugene Tackleberry is close to being the best comedy performance in this, Winslow's character Larvell Jones another cadet is actually funny in this, the noises this guy makes are very memorable even from this film. The movie isn't bad in my opinion far from it, many critics in the day really hated this but it isn't really a movie so dumb you'll want to turn it off, it has it's moments and some are pretty good but I just felt it is a little too dumb to be anything but average.Hugh Wilson is the guy behind this directing and co-writing and he doesn't do so well, the moments in which the film could have been funny are squandered by bad choices direction wise and making some jokes just too crude. The movie could also be said to be misogynistic and homophobic which could be true, I heard many homophobic slurs and characters saying another is gay as an offensive term. The treatment of women in the film is questionable and although Cattrall's character Karen Thompson is a strong minded woman, many women in this are seen only in a sexual way.I think although the film can be backwards, some moments of this movie do have good humour and can be funny(it doesn't excuse the backward attitudes though). It mostly gets by in the laughing areas with physical humour and at times Commandant Lassard the man in charge of the academy has some great one liners. Lt. Harris played by G.W. Bailey is also pretty good in his role, he is easily dislikeable and so many things that happen to harm him or offend him are easily likable moments of this movie. Overall I can't really recommend Police Academy mostly because it's just not that good, I mean some people may really like it and it could right up you street but it's too silly for me and I feel for others too. So there you have it, the start to a long running series of films that just seemed to never stop, it did finally of course but even today they are talking about doing a reboot, I hope if they do then it can actually be a good film for once.
