You start the game, clear each n every obstacle, almost make it to the final mark but either the time is over or you're dead. So what do you do when it's already game over? You restart. And continue doing that until you finally make it through. And that's exactly how the events depicted in Run Lola Run unfold.Presenting 3 different alternatives of a single event, Run Lola Run begins with Lola receiving a phone call from her boyfriend Manny who lost 100,000 Deutschmark which belongs to a mob he was working for. Lola has 20 minutes to raise that money & meet him or else he goes to rob a store. As Lola starts her run, we see her bumping into different people & how their lives are changed for better or worse through this minor encounter with Lola.The direction by Tom Tykwer is as stylish as it is brilliant. The script has an engaging complexity & the lush cinematography plus clever editing makes the drama even more compelling. Plus, Lola is one hell of a character who can break glasses with her screams, has the running stamina of Forrest Gump & is superbly played by Franka Potente. Even the guy who plays Manny is good and the little animation present in the film is wonderfully carried out.Another amazing thing I loved about this film is the little flash-forward segments depicting the aftermath of the people's lives Lola keeps bumping into & how she has affected them all. On an overall scale, Run Lola Run is a wildly entertaining, exciting & energetic cinema from Germany that expertly blends its little spicy ingredients to deliver a a cinematic experience that's smart, mind-pleasing & immensely satisfying. This is passionate filmmaking at its best. ","genre":null},{"date":"4 May 2014","score":"","review":" How this film plays itself is the same way how you play a video game.

In fact, horror can stem from many different aspects, one of them being psychological, which is the subgenre that the film caters to. Through use of strong acting and an interesting story, the film manages to explain why it etched itself into the list of greatest American films ever made simply by existing and going what nobody thought its own genre could do.The film stars Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, who is pulled from her training at an FBI academy by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), who works for a unit in behavioral sciences. Jack grants Clarice the honor of meeting one-on-one with former psychiatrist and serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who is also known for cannibalistic crimes. Lecter's knowledge is requested because of a serial killer nicknamed Buffalo Bill currently running rampant in the streets, who is highly-publicized and known to skin the corpses of his female victims.Upon arriving at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Clarice meets a surprisingly mannered and well-articulate man that is Hannibal Lecter and not the psychotic murderer one would believe. What unravels is a strange relationship between an FBI trainee and an insane mental patient. Starling has to get close to Lecter for his knowledge and insight into the crimes of Buffalo Bill, but also must refrain from dangerously close connections which could instantly spark something detrimental to her well-being.The first thing to marvel at with this film is how it utilizes its talent, plunging Foster and Hopkins into a story and set of circumstances that need to be well acted in order to be believable and gripping; both veteran talents do not slump here. Foster gives a very solid performance as Clarice, that is mostly successful at avoided the often alienating tropes that result when we focus on cops or undercover investigators for two hours. Then there's Hopkins, in a role he has become known for for good reason. Hopkins instantly clicks here as Lecter, provoking fright and unsettled nerves with viewers. Rather than over-the-top zaniness, Lecter relies on quiet, mannered acting techniques that are all the more frightening because of how out of the ordinary and unexpected they are from a man of his caliber. This leads the viewer to ping-pong back and forth with the idea that Lecter is really a misunderstood victim or an amazingly talented con-artist.Then there's the mounting tension on display here, largely thanks to Jonathan Demme's direction and Ted Tally's screenplay. The film plays like a true detective story, utilizing slowburn and patient tension in order to achieve a great, suspenseful result. These kinds of films hold up because they deliver something new each time one sees them. This being my first time viewing The Silence of the Lambs one gets the idea that even after seeing it, watching it again would be a great experience because it would allow you to pay more attention to the serene details of the film and how the end result came to be.With strong work behind the camera, and equally strong work in front, there's really no shock that The Silence of the Lambs came out the way it did, a strong and capable psychological thriller\/horror film that beautifully relies on nuances and mannerisms rather than shock and awe. The fact that the film may have lead some to look at the horror genre with a bit more respect in the short-run would maybe be a stronger statement if horror didn't go south in the long-run. But that's another blog\/review for another time.Starring Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, and Ted Levine. Directed by Jonathan Demme.

It undoubtedly penetrates straight to the deepest insecurities of our childhood, stirs them and then, finally, reassures them. As adults, we love it because it reminds us of the journey we have taken since first viewing the film. The Wizard of Oz fills such a large space in our imagination. It somehow seems real and important in a way most movies don't. To this day, each time I watch The Wizard of Oz, I pick up on different small details that I had not previously noticed. The film takes us along on a journey that young Dorothy, played by actress Judy Garland, and her little dog Toto embark on after being swept away from her Kansas farm home in a twister. They are taken to the wonderful Land of Oz After having offended the Wicked Witch of the West, played by Margaret Hamilton, Dorothy is protected from her wrath by the ruby slippers that she obtains. At the suggestion of Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, played by Billie Burke, Dorothy heads down the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City, where dwells the all-powerful Wizard of Oz, who might be able to help the girl return to Kansas. On her journey, she befriends a Scarecrow, played by Ray Bolger, a Tin Man, played by Jack Haley, and a Cowardly Lion, played by Bert Lahr. The Scarecrow would like to have some brains, the Tin Man craves a heart, and the Lion wants to attain courage. In hopes that the Wizard might also be able to help them too, they accompany Dorothy on her journey to the Emerald City.Of all the years I have been watching The Wizard of Oz, I had never previously picked up on the importance of the change from black and white to color. The switch from black and white to color had a very important role back in 1939 when this film was first made. Up to this time-frame, films were still primarily done in black and white until the prior release of another classic. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was made in 1937 and it pioneered the idea of a color animation feature. With The Wizard of Oz following its release and combining both black and white and color filming, it was sure to be a classic. The Wizard of Oz began one way and ended in another completely. Richard Thorpe was the original director of the film but was fired after only 12 days on the job. Next came George Cukor, who lasted just three days. When Victor Fleming took over, things were finally progressing. Not only were there direction changes, but there were also cast changes that took place. The actor, Buddy Ebsen, who was originally the Tin Man, had to be replaced after having an allergic reaction to the silver makeup involved in the costume. He was replaced by Jack Haley. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic. How does it manage to still shine, when others falter year after year? It has a lot to do with the dynamic cast, heartfelt songs, and eye-catching special effects. The story of The Wizard of Oz shows us how young Dorothy is learning about evil, friendship, and fallibility. The message in this film along with its presentation is why people of all ages continue to view it time and time again all these years later. I don't see this changing any time soon.

From the writing of the screenplay to the cast and crew, this film is top caliber and worthy of all of the Oscar nominations and accolades bestowed upon it. This movie is at its best when viewed the first time, but each time after I seem to notice something that I had not before. That is the genius of this film.Director Ron Howard leads a talented team of actors and actresses to deliver one of my all-time favorite movies. John Nash (actor Russell Crowe) is a mathematician who is battling the debilitating mental illness, Schizophrenia. Alicia Larde (actress Jennifer Connelly) is a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T), where John Nash is a professor, who falls in love with and eventually becomes his wife.There actually two good stories intertwined to make A Beautiful Mind the classic that it is sure to be. The first is the life and accomplishments of Nobel Prize, for Economics, winner John Nash; the second is insight into the disease schizophrenia, and the effect it has on John and those closest to him. Similar to Teddy Daniels, Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the movie Shutter Island, this disease takes over their lives. Eventually removing the separation between reality and fantasy.My first insight into the quality of this film appeared when John Nash, a self-described loner, is attending Princeton for Graduate school; he is housed with a roommate named Charles, (actor Paul Bettany). Charles is boisterous and out-going, where Nash is the serious workaholic. Charles is also a delusion of John's mental illness. Throughout his time in the film, Charles is ingrained into the scenes, whether it is playing pool or standing outside the Helinger's office, Hellinger is played by Judd Hirsch. The nuance I did not notice until the second viewing is that Charles, and similarly with the other delusions, only interacted with John Nash. Even when Marcee, Charles' niece (actress Vivien Cardone), was running around the Princeton campus chasing birds, none of the pigeons took flight in fear of her. The timing and tempo of the movie, made these characters appear as they are the same as John and Alicia themselves. It made later characters, Dr Rosen, more difficult to discern as real or not.Another quality of the film that I enjoyed was the use of invisible sound. There is a point in the film where Alicia is gathering clothes from a clothes line, she hears what appears to be cryptic radio chatter. These noises appear to be coming from the inside of a small garage at rear of the property. When she goes to investigate, she discovers just how far along her husband's illness has progressed. He was supposed to be taking medication to keep his illness under control. With this discovery, she knows he has stopped taking his medications and that theirs sons life is in danger.One of the more memorable moments of the film is a conversation that John has with Charles atop the roof of their dormitory at Princeton. It happens the day they find out that they are roommates; John is explaining to Charles why he isn't good with people. John tells Charles, The truth is, I don't much like people&#x85; And they don't much like me. Later in the conversation, they delve into why John is so driven to work as hard as he does; John states, find a truly original idea. It's the only way to distinguish myself. Only way to truly matter. To me, those are very powerful insights about John Nash. The fact that he is having this conversation with a person created from his illness is telling to the seriousness of his disorder. John graduates Princeton and gets a job, teaching at the Wheeler Lab, on the campus of M.I.T. During his time there, he is contracted to do cryptography work for the Department of Defense (DoD). After finishing one of his jobs decrypting Russian code, John meets Parcher (actor Ed Harris). Parcher seeks Johns help decrypting more Russian code to help foil a plot to detonate a mobile nuclear device on US soil. Parcher, like Charles, is a product of John's schizophrenia. Where Charles seemed to befriend John, Parcher seemed to use patriotism and fear to get Nash to do what he needed him to do.Eventually, with the help of Alicia and Dr. Rosen (actor Christopher Plummer) John comes to realize that Chalres, Marcee and Parcher are not flesh and blood, but part of his illness. This is the turning point in the lives of John and Alicia. Up to this point, John has been in denial of the diagnosis from Dr. Rosen, even so far as to claim Dr. Rosen is a Russian doctor trying to silence him. John almost drowns his son in the bath tub, claiming that Charles was watching him; then he shows Alicia out of the way as he thinks Parcher is about to shoot her for treason. When faced with a return to the mental hospital for more treatment, John tells Alicia that he now knows that these people are not real, he explains to her, I know they are not real, Marcee never ages.Through all of the highs and lows that are John Nash's life, there is Russell Crowe giving a superb performance. All of the symptomatic subtleties, from the unusual walk to the way he talks and averts his eyes; Russell Crowe is most deserved of his Oscar nomination. His portrayal, of both, John Nash and of a man battling a mental illness would be worthy of a nomination for either performance.

John tells Charles, The truth is, I don't much like people&#x85; And they don't much like me. Later in the conversation, they delve into why John is so driven to work as hard as he does; John states, find a truly original idea. It's the only way to distinguish myself. Only way to truly matter. To me, those are very powerful insights about John Nash. The fact that he is having this conversation with a person created from his illness is telling to the seriousness of his disorder. John graduates Princeton and gets a job, teaching at the Wheeler Lab, on the campus of M.I.T. During his time there, he is contracted to do cryptography work for the Department of Defense (DoD). After finishing one of his jobs decrypting Russian code, John meets Parcher (actor Ed Harris). Parcher seeks Johns help decrypting more Russian code to help foil a plot to detonate a mobile nuclear device on US soil. Parcher, like Charles, is a product of John's schizophrenia. Where Charles seemed to befriend John, Parcher seemed to use patriotism and fear to get Nash to do what he needed him to do.Eventually, with the help of Alicia and Dr. Rosen (actor Christopher Plummer) John comes to realize that Chalres, Marcee and Parcher are not flesh and blood, but part of his illness. This is the turning point in the lives of John and Alicia. Up to this point, John has been in denial of the diagnosis from Dr. Rosen, even so far as to claim Dr. Rosen is a Russian doctor trying to silence him. John almost drowns his son in the bath tub, claiming that Charles was watching him; then he shows Alicia out of the way as he thinks Parcher is about to shoot her for treason. When faced with a return to the mental hospital for more treatment, John tells Alicia that he now knows that these people are not real, he explains to her, I know they are not real, Marcee never ages.Through all of the highs and lows that are John Nash's life, there is Russell Crowe giving a superb performance. All of the symptomatic subtleties, from the unusual walk to the way he talks and averts his eyes; Russell Crowe is most deserved of his Oscar nomination. His portrayal, of both, John Nash and of a man battling a mental illness would be worthy of a nomination for either performance.

From the writing of the screenplay to the cast and crew, this film is top caliber and worthy of all of the Oscar nominations and accolades bestowed upon it. This movie is at its best when viewed the first time, but each time after I seem to notice something that I had not before. That is the genius of this film.Director Ron Howard leads a talented team of actors and actresses to deliver one of my all-time favorite movies. John Nash (actor Russell Crowe) is a mathematician who is battling the debilitating mental illness, Schizophrenia. Alicia Larde (actress Jennifer Connelly) is a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T), where John Nash is a professor, who falls in love with and eventually becomes his wife.There actually two good stories intertwined to make A Beautiful Mind the classic that it is sure to be. The first is the life and accomplishments of Nobel Prize, for Economics, winner John Nash; the second is insight into the disease schizophrenia, and the effect it has on John and those closest to him. Similar to Teddy Daniels, Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the movie Shutter Island, this disease takes over their lives. Eventually removing the separation between reality and fantasy.My first insight into the quality of this film appeared when John Nash, a self-described loner, is attending Princeton for Graduate school; he is housed with a roommate named Charles, (actor Paul Bettany). Charles is boisterous and out-going, where Nash is the serious workaholic. Charles is also a delusion of John's mental illness. Throughout his time in the film, Charles is ingrained into the scenes, whether it is playing pool or standing outside the Helinger's office, Hellinger is played by Judd Hirsch. The nuance I did not notice until the second viewing is that Charles, and similarly with the other delusions, only interacted with John Nash. Even when Marcee, Charles' niece (actress Vivien Cardone), was running around the Princeton campus chasing birds, none of the pigeons took flight in fear of her. The timing and tempo of the movie, made these characters appear as they are the same as John and Alicia themselves. It made later characters, Dr Rosen, more difficult to discern as real or not.Another quality of the film that I enjoyed was the use of invisible sound. There is a point in the film where Alicia is gathering clothes from a clothes line, she hears what appears to be cryptic radio chatter. These noises appear to be coming from the inside of a small garage at rear of the property. When she goes to investigate, she discovers just how far along her husband's illness has progressed. He was supposed to be taking medication to keep his illness under control. With this discovery, she knows he has stopped taking his medications and that theirs sons life is in danger.One of the more memorable moments of the film is a conversation that John has with Charles atop the roof of their dormitory at Princeton.

It involves a guy who is just trying to get over his ex girlfriend finding a new guy. And even though he's an actor\/comedian he still comes off as relatable to us normal guys just trying to find somebody. Jon Favreau is great and plays well off the other few main cast members. It has its funny moments but isn't as humorous as advertised. Its well written and even has a real good ending that's ambiguous, which as a movie is extremely hard to do. I love the café seen where Vaughn thinks hes getting some weird vibe from the women, as being a fan of the Superhero Cafe on youtube is really cool to see.This movie even surprised me at some parts, because even when you think hes going to finally pull through and get a new girl the story turns and does something else. But i do think the whole story plot with the other group of guys who start a fight was a waste and not really needed for the overall story.

It was the first film I remember seeing, it stayed with me through my childhood and infused me with a passion for film that has never left me. To this day, I am a Star Wars fan and probably well remain forever after.Star Wars is a film that offers up a science fiction extravaganza containing elements we already know. Lucas offers a story that we can easily get comfortable with. He offers character types and gives them bold personalities The callow youth, the hot-shot, the wise old wizard, the beautiful princess (in need of rescue, of course) and the loyal support of the muscle and the bickering comic relief. He offers a villainous enterprise not a million miles removed from the Nazi regime. He places his heroes in the path of overwhelming odds so that tiniest dot in the universe ends up making a dent in the villain's evil plan.For better and for worse, Star Wars would change the direction of American cinema. The decade had been ushered in by a new breed of rebel filmmakers like Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola, Robert Altman, Steven Spielberg who made personal films, small intimate films that didn't need a large budget. But when Jaws and Star Wars both became a box office triumph, Hollywood saw the box office potential and turned their intentions toward a large scale entertainment.What Lucas had that other filmmakers in this genre did not was an eye for detail. It is easy to hammer together a series of cardboard sets and have actors stand in front of them but to create a desert town populated by humans, aliens, creatures and droids packed into the background so that entire frame feels populated was something unheard of. He also created what has been called the used future, realizing that automobiles in his fantasy world should look used and rusted and aged, not sleek and looking as it if were created before the camera was turned on. Note Luke Skywalker's Landspeeder which has a thick coat of rust and grime and a paint job that suggests it has spent it's entire existence sitting in the hot sun. Also note Han Solo's Millennium Falcon, a rusty hulk that seems hammered together from spare parts (the in-joke of the film is that the heroes keep noting how shoddy it looks even as it's saving their skins).As with all landmark films Star Wars was the right movie for the right time. It came along in the mid-seventies, in the midst of a wave of personal and gritty films like Taxi Driver, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now, movies that were born out of the decade after the production codes had collapsed and filmmakers were free to tell real stories without persecution and nullifying censorship. It was Star Wars that put that kind of film out to pasture and in it's wake came the era of the blockbuster, when films for profit became the mainstay. For well and for ill, it changed the Hollywood mindset and moved the industry toward more fantasy oriented fare, an era we are still experiencing.For Lucas, making the film was an uphill battle because, at the time, science fiction was considered box office poison. The most prominent sci-fi was Kubrik's 2001 A Space Odyssey, a film that had more detractors then fans. The studio feared that the same reaction would meet Star Wars and had so little confidence in it's success that they set up a tax shelter for when the film flopped. The distributor couldn't get theaters to buy the film unless they sold it as a package deal with a movie that they thought was destined to be a blockbuster - The Other Side of Midnight - Heard of it? Me neither.Yet the film did succeed, mostly due in part to Lucas' decision to make the film his own way. He broke the rules by eliminating traditional opening credits (he paid a fine for this and then dropped out of the Director's Guild). He announces that the story takes place in the past but look like the future. He starts in the middle of the series (this is Episode IV) progresses his saga forward then turns back and tells the preceding story up to the point where this film begins.  By starting in the middle he develops a story that already has a rich history with characters that are fleshed out to the point that we are always interested in their relationships. He develops a warrior spirit that is passed on from one generation to the next, from an old wizard Ben Kenobi, who is the keeper of a dying zen religion - The Force - that favors patience and a clear-head over mindless violence. He imparts it upon the young Luke Skywalker, a callow youth hungry for adventure that we only slowly understand is the one who will bring about the end of the Nazi-like Galactic Empire. The friends he takes along on his journey start as bold character types (a hotshot loner, a loyal dog-like companion, a feisty revolutionary and a pair of bickering robot who provide the comedy relief) but eventually their personality become more refined and we care about their journey. Lucas was generous in these details.Star Wars is a pure movie-going experience, a red-blooded adventure that takes the elements of it's genre seriously. Many films have matched it's success in dollar amounts but none has had the cultural impact. It has become part of our language. Like The Wizard of Oz, it propels us on a journey of such joy and imagination and has worked it's way so firmly into our popular imagination that we can hardly imagine our culture without them.

Wings of Desire is likely the greatest film that comes at it from an opposite angle, and is amazing in a whole new way. Yes, there are depressed characters, a prostitute, a suicide. This isn't a naive film. But the overall message overcomes it all- we can focus on the positive.As a story about an angel, Damiel, who longs to be human, Wings of Desire can open a viewer's eyes as to how the physical world is not a bad place to be. We see what the angels lack that we have- colour, touch, taste, freedom. We learn we can be amazed by these things, and should be. There is something mystical to the woman who folds up her umbrella and lets herself get soaked, to the child who describes how a fern grew from dirt to an astonished teacher, to the boy who listens to The Odyssey and stops blinking.

Along the way, Andy learns what it takes to live comfortably in prison and makes a few friends along the way. Andy's best friend becomes Ellis Redding (Red), played by Morgan Freeman. Eventually, Andy discovers that a man has admitted to killing his wife and her lover and becomes annoyed that he is forced to stay in prison. Andy then creates an elaborate plan of escape and a way to live well after that. The main theme to this film would be the importance of freedom and friendship. It was freedom that drove Andy. Andy missed the simpler things in life and tried to bring them to the prison. Andy missed being able to have a drink with his friends, he missed the sound of music, he missed making a difference in the world. As a high up banker, Andy had many responsibilities but in prison he started out as just he laundry guy. Later, Andy forced himself to be the warden's personal accountant. But it was friendship that helps push Andy along. Without the friends he makes along the way, Andy would have been all alone and would have probably died not much longer. Andy's best friend, Red, was his greatest point of motivation. Red was comfortable in prison and knew how to live well by prison standards. But Red also knew how to be a decent person after being in prison for so long. Red was Andy's escape from the savage ways of the other prison mates. A similar film with the same themes would be The Patriot. This film has the same freedom theme as Shawshank. The characters in The Patriot are all fighting for freedom. They feel as if England has oppressed them long enough and wish to be free men. The same feeling is felt in Shawshank. Andy is feeling oppressed by the guards and the sisters pushing him around that he wants a change. Andy's strategy is less dramatic because he is only one man, but the drive and emotional toll is still there. Shawshank Redemption is such a great film for many reasons. But the technique that makes it such a great film is the sound. It is so simple because there is no background sounds in this film. There are not any dramatic music scenes to help pull us in the film. The reason for this is because prison is a scary thing and to scare the audience more, all they had to do is let us listen to someone get beat up in the middle of a cold concrete floor. This helps us want freedom for Andy and Red. It wants us to help them escape.

I think the main theme of the film would be power and responsibility. We can see this throughout the film in the scenes with Michael and Vito talking in the hospital, Michael having the bosses killed off during the baptism, and finally the end of the film, when we see members of the family recognizing Michael as the new head of the family. In the beginning of the film, we see that Michael doesn't want anything to do with the organized crime side to his family. We see this when he is talking with Kay, he tells her that it's not who he is. As the film progresses, Michael slowly becomes entangled in the crime side to his family. After Vito is shot and is in the hospital, and Sonny is killed, Michael knows it's his responsibility to watch over his family. After Vito passes away we see Michael taking control and his rise to power. I think the best scene that shows this is the baptism scene. We see him sitting in the church listening to the baptism, then we cut away to the other bosses being killed off by the Corleone family. You know that Michael is the head of the family, but this is not confirmed until the final scene. As the camera pans out, you see members of the family kissing the hand of Michael, acknowledging that he is the new head Don of the family. Even though the film is about the Corleone family, the film focuses on Michael. This focus shows how he changes from a quiet soldier returning home from war, to the head of the top crime family in New York. Another movie where we see this kind of theme, would be the film Goodfellas. With Goodfellas, you see the rise to power of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and how he takes responsibility at the end to protect his family.I think the lighting plays a key role in the theme. Several scenes are shot with low-key lighting to bring the dramatic intensity of the scene. A great example of this would be when Michael, Sollozzo, and McCluskey are driving to the restaurant. The lighting is very low, focusing on the faces of the men. The scene shows Michael meeting on behalf of his family, taking responsibility and trying to stop the attempts on his father's life.Another technique that plays a key role would be the camera angle. A great example of this would be the subjective viewpoint at Louie's restaurant before Sollozzo and McCluskey are shot. The camera angle puts us in the conversation, showing the intensity of the situation. When Michael shoots both Sollozzo and McCluskey, it shows the power of the Corleone family and Michael taking responsibility to protect the family. As I watched The Godfather and recognized the theme, I could only sum up the move by saying that Power and responsibility can be a deadly combination ","genre":null},{"date":"4 May 2014","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" SpoilerThe film takes place in the 1940's Mafia era of New York as it follows the Corleone family and their rise to power.The movie has an award winning cast that includes Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone), Al Pacino (Michael Corleone), James Caan (Sonny Corleone), Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen), and Diane Keaton (Kay Adams&#x96; Corleone).

I think the main theme of the film would be power and responsibility. We can see this throughout the film in the scenes with Michael and Vito talking in the hospital, Michael having the bosses killed off during the baptism, and finally the end of the film, when we see members of the family recognizing Michael as the new head of the family. In the beginning of the film, we see that Michael doesn't want anything to do with the organized crime side to his family. We see this when he is talking with Kay, he tells her that it's not who he is. As the film progresses, Michael slowly becomes entangled in the crime side to his family. After Vito is shot and is in the hospital, and Sonny is killed, Michael knows it's his responsibility to watch over his family. After Vito passes away we see Michael taking control and his rise to power. I think the best scene that shows this is the baptism scene. We see him sitting in the church listening to the baptism, then we cut away to the other bosses being killed off by the Corleone family. You know that Michael is the head of the family, but this is not confirmed until the final scene. As the camera pans out, you see members of the family kissing the hand of Michael, acknowledging that he is the new head Don of the family. Even though the film is about the Corleone family, the film focuses on Michael. This focus shows how he changes from a quiet soldier returning home from war, to the head of the top crime family in New York. Another movie where we see this kind of theme, would be the film Goodfellas. With Goodfellas, you see the rise to power of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and how he takes responsibility at the end to protect his family.I think the lighting plays a key role in the theme. Several scenes are shot with low-key lighting to bring the dramatic intensity of the scene. A great example of this would be when Michael, Sollozzo, and McCluskey are driving to the restaurant. The lighting is very low, focusing on the faces of the men. The scene shows Michael meeting on behalf of his family, taking responsibility and trying to stop the attempts on his father's life.Another technique that plays a key role would be the camera angle. A great example of this would be the subjective viewpoint at Louie's restaurant before Sollozzo and McCluskey are shot. The camera angle puts us in the conversation, showing the intensity of the situation. When Michael shoots both Sollozzo and McCluskey, it shows the power of the Corleone family and Michael taking responsibility to protect the family. As I watched The Godfather and recognized the theme, I could only sum up the move by saying that Power and responsibility can be a deadly combination ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"4 May 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Story about three guys who are 19 or 20--Hans (Maarten Spanjer), Rien (Hans von Tongeren) and Eef (Toon Agterberg). They live in a small industrial town in Holland. They have nothing in common except for their love of motocross. Then sexy Fientje (Renee Soutendijk) moves to town and makes a play for each of them thinking they have (or will have) plenty of money and she can live off them.Great movie. It is vulgar and VERY sexually graphic--there's plenty of sex talk, full frontal shots of women AND men, simulated sex, a gay rape scene and a hardcore gay sex scene. Still they are all needed for the story and to understand the motivations of the guys. It's well-directed by Paul Verhoeven, has a pulsating soundtrack, moves quickly and has good acting--especially by Soutendijk and Agterberg. It has tragic and hopeful endings for all the guys done in a realistic and truthful manner. Also Rutger Hauer has a small role as a conceited motocross champion.Verhoeven (who also wrote the script) was attacked for this film. It was called anti-gay, anti-woman, anti-cripple and way too sexually explicit (I do wonder how he got some of the actors to agree to perform in some of these scenes--especially the gay rape). He only made one more film in Holland (The 4th Man) before coming to Hollywood and turning out one blockbuster after another. This was barely shown in the US and was put on cable in a horribly cut R rated print with dubbing! This review is based on the subtitled directors cut.

The concept of this film is really innovative and works perfectly in delivering a good amount of scare and action. The pace of the film is great, creating a lot of suspense and unexpected twists. The characters work well in the plot, they have interesting personalities (it's still a movie about sharks eating people, so don't expect them to be too deep and complicated). The cast was also very good and all the actors did great in their roles. Only the comic relief guy didn't quite work for me, I think he was a bit too much on Jar-Jar-Binkish side and didn't really fit in the general atmosphere of the film. I also liked the CGI and I think it was done really well, without overusing it. The moves of CGI sharks sometimes are a bit unrealistic, but the overall impression is quite good. The sharks are incredibly fast, agile and scary. However, there is one major drawback to the film. As I watched it, towards the end of the movie I've got really confused, as the characters suddenly started behaving like they either went crazy or got amnesia. When I checked the IMDb afterwards, it turned out the ending was completely changed in post-production. However they had no way of re-shooting these scenes, so they cut and edited the material they had to fit the new story. Still, it couldn't change the fact that actors were playing a different script. I'm not saying that one ending was better than the other, but in my opinion they should have just stick to the original idea since it was too late to change it. The way it was done, the ending left something of a really bad aftertaste (of a movie that was pretty nice apart from these last scenes). Another thing I didn't like was the amount of suspension of disbelief required to watch this movie. It's true that for films such as Jurassic Park or Resident Evil, the continuity, the logic and the laws of physics often have to sit in the corner and just shut up (often taking biology & genetics with them too). However, in this movie the amount of it leaves you often confused about how some things happened and disturbs the plot.Overall, I think it was worth seeing and really entertaining, and I would give it 7\/10 if it wasn't for that horrible, patched-up ending. As it is, I give it 4\/10.

The concept of this film is really innovative and works perfectly in delivering a good amount of scare and action. The pace of the film is great, creating a lot of suspense and unexpected twists. The characters work well in the plot, they have interesting personalities (it's still a movie about sharks eating people, so don't expect them to be too deep and complicated). The cast was also very good and all the actors did great in their roles. Only the comic relief guy didn't quite work for me, I think he was a bit too much on Jar-Jar-Binkish side and didn't really fit in the general atmosphere of the film. I also liked the CGI and I think it was done really well, without overusing it. The moves of CGI sharks sometimes are a bit unrealistic, but the overall impression is quite good. The sharks are incredibly fast, agile and scary. However, there is one major drawback to the film. As I watched it, towards the end of the movie I've got really confused, as the characters suddenly started behaving like they either went crazy or got amnesia. When I checked the IMDb afterwards, it turned out the ending was completely changed in post-production. However they had no way of re-shooting these scenes, so they cut and edited the material they had to fit the new story. Still, it couldn't change the fact that actors were playing a different script. I'm not saying that one ending was better than the other, but in my opinion they should have just stick to the original idea since it was too late to change it. The way it was done, the ending left something of a really bad aftertaste (of a movie that was pretty nice apart from these last scenes). Another thing I didn't like was the amount of suspension of disbelief required to watch this movie.
