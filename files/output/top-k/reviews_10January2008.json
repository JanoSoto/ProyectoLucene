These were my first thoughts when I heard that this film will be the next topic our English class has to deal with. But that is absolutely not the case! This film is a great enrichment for the viewer and it is no boring stuff at all.Ayub Khan-Din wrote a fantastic script which is perfectly put into action by Damien O'Donnell. The cast members did a good job by giving their characters influences to link them into the right direction. For example Om Puri who played his complex character George Khan with such a conviction and even the youngest cast member Jordan Routledge who has absolutely not to hide behind his co-cast members in his performance of &#132;Sajid Khan. Also the setting in the 70's is a big success so that you get the impression as if you are living within this time. Mostly I liked the way the writers handled the difficult topic of the different lifestyles of Pakistani and British people without speaking in favour for one group. They used a lot of prejudices about both cultures but they converted it into funny scenes everybody has to laugh about. So a good balance between comedy and tragedy is created because of the spontaneous comic relieves. The film gives a good opportunity for watching it for entertainment but also for talking seriously about it, like for example the two generations and their different points of view On the one hand we can see the young generation of Sajid who does not care if his friend Earnest is a Pakistani or not. And also Tariq who does not want to be a devout Pakistani and likes partying all night even if his father gets angry about it. But on the other hand, there is the older generation of immigrants George belongs to which is extremely influenced by their traditional values and it is hard for them to adapt to the British society. It seems as if especially George does not learn from his mistakes After the failed arranged marriage of eldest son Nazir, he tries to plan marriages for his sons Tariq and Abdul who are strongly against it. At the end, left alone from his family, George seems to be contemplative and Ella goes back to him for reconciliation. But the viewer does not get to know whether George changes his behaviour or not but you can still hope it! And that's why East is East is such an intoxicating movie Everybody can identify with one of the characters and so you suffer with Ella when she is beaten up by her husband, you laugh with the siblings when they are teasing each other, you want to give them good advices and most importantly, you think about what you would have done in their situation.So I can really recommend watching this movie because of the good balance of comical and tragically effects, the great actors and not to forget, the fantastic story written by a man who collected his first experiences by creating this script which was such a success.

Elinor is contrasted perfectly by Marianne's character, again a wonderful performance by Kate Winslet, even though you want to slap her at times. Like most people on this site I don't understand how Marianne could prefer Willoughby to Brandon. Alan Rickman is just scrummy and sexy and I would take him any day. You just know that he will love, worship and protect Marianne all their his lives and in the wedding scene they both look so happy and Marianne appears to have last grown up. My favourite scene is when Brandon walks in when she is singing and you can see him fall in love with her before your very eyes. I think that is her own voice because I have heard her singing voice before and she can definitely carry a tune. All the other performances are good but I especially love Hugh Laurie as Mr Palmer, but you can't help wondering why he married Charlotte as he appears to find her so irritating.

I saw it first in theaters when it was first released, in German with subtitles (great); saw it again in theaters, dubbed in English (awful); and then just saw it on the DVD director's cut with subtitles (excellent). The last was definitely the best.No war movie has ever captured the reality of the soldier's experience like this one. It's a submarine movie, so of course you're going to get the stock scenes of destroyers on the surface, tense men listening to the sonar ping, depth charges, diving deeper and deeper, etc. But it is so much more convincing in this movie than in any other in its genre (Run Silent, Run Deep and The Enemy Below come to mind).But don't expect non-stop wall-to-wall action; the realism of the movie comes through in depicting the long periods of time when there was nothing to do cruising through stormy seas, wandering about with no particular task or mission, the frustrations of the crew after weeks of inaction, etc. As a movie, this presents a problem because the viewer is taken through all that time in somewhat realistic fashion, which in turn makes the film long and not quite as gripping.The real punch of the movie, though, are the characters, their life on board, their hopes for a successful cruise and a return to normalcy. The actors do a fantastic job, all of them, but the captain and the chief engineer are probably the best, along with the journalist on board. The best scene, one which I remembered clearly ever since I first saw it in 1981, was the one where the sub crew goes on board the supply ship at Christmas time; the stark contrast between these rough, slimy, smelly crewmen and the polished, uniform-clad, hair combed and slicked officers on the supply ship, was just phenomenal. To think that some men went through the war in hell like the submariners, while others basically lived like kings, is just too painful to really comprehend.The ending is very creative, very surprising, and emotionally devastating. After seeing Das Boot, I can't ever bring myself to watch any other submarine movie.I give it 9.5\/10 stars; just barely on the edge of a perfect 10, but not quite.

And that's almost essentially what it is. This sequel follows the rules of sequels true to form. Increases the madness, increases the mayhem, increases the body count and does more spectacular explosions. Returning are most of the main players from Die Hard (some in minor roles), the yippy-kay-yay catchphrase and the surprisingly regular presence of black Americans (something I like).First of all, I have to say that Die Hard 2 is not a thinking person's movie. Think too much about what's going on and it will fall apart. The characterizations and decisions made by characters in the course of the film are not all that realistic and the sequence of events of the film doesn't hold up to much logical scrutiny. But despite this, Die Hard 2 has a surprisingly high entertainment factor and if studying film hadn't permanently turned on my ever present analytical side, I'm pretty sure I would've been able to fully ignore these issues and enjoy myself.You see, Die Hard 2 is, in some ways, like a really enthusiastic, but not too bright person. While, if you really listen to what the guy is saying, it's not going to come across as sensible or rational, his overall glee and rampant eagerness provides a kind of charm that might just win you over anyway. Die Hard 2 works really really really hard to make all those leaps in logic and giant plot holes palatable and works really really really hard to win you over with good natured entertainment.But this is not Die Hard one. The villains in this film don't have anyone as potent as Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber. There is no real solid supporting character like Reginald VelJohnson's Al Powell. On the plus side, although the bureaucrats in this film are a little ridiculous, they don't approach the total silliness of the FBI agents in Die Hard. Bruce Willis does manage to carry Die Hard 2, but without a worthy antagonist or strong supporting characters, it just seems emptier. Furthermore, the previous film had some notable personal issues that needed to be dealt with, this one really only has the issue of the terrorists, so it doesn't really have any real growth for the characters either, which further waters down the soup of Die Hard 2.Nonetheless, despite all these things counting against Die Hard 2, it still remains entertaining enough to not be a total waste of time. But this film is more lightweight than the last and certainly not mandatory watching. It holds together because John McClane is so much fun to watch (and the slight bits of reflexive humor thrown in do help to lighten the tone, making the silliness a little more acceptable). And so if all you're looking for is a night of good entertainment, watch the original Die Hard. If, afterwords, you want more of the explosions, ridiculous scenarios and the bad-ass John McClane, this is the next logical place to go. 7\/10.

The characterizations and decisions made by characters in the course of the film are not all that realistic and the sequence of events of the film doesn't hold up to much logical scrutiny. But despite this, Die Hard 2 has a surprisingly high entertainment factor and if studying film hadn't permanently turned on my ever present analytical side, I'm pretty sure I would've been able to fully ignore these issues and enjoy myself.You see, Die Hard 2 is, in some ways, like a really enthusiastic, but not too bright person. While, if you really listen to what the guy is saying, it's not going to come across as sensible or rational, his overall glee and rampant eagerness provides a kind of charm that might just win you over anyway. Die Hard 2 works really really really hard to make all those leaps in logic and giant plot holes palatable and works really really really hard to win you over with good natured entertainment.But this is not Die Hard one. The villains in this film don't have anyone as potent as Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber. There is no real solid supporting character like Reginald VelJohnson's Al Powell. On the plus side, although the bureaucrats in this film are a little ridiculous, they don't approach the total silliness of the FBI agents in Die Hard. Bruce Willis does manage to carry Die Hard 2, but without a worthy antagonist or strong supporting characters, it just seems emptier. Furthermore, the previous film had some notable personal issues that needed to be dealt with, this one really only has the issue of the terrorists, so it doesn't really have any real growth for the characters either, which further waters down the soup of Die Hard 2.Nonetheless, despite all these things counting against Die Hard 2, it still remains entertaining enough to not be a total waste of time. But this film is more lightweight than the last and certainly not mandatory watching. It holds together because John McClane is so much fun to watch (and the slight bits of reflexive humor thrown in do help to lighten the tone, making the silliness a little more acceptable). And so if all you're looking for is a night of good entertainment, watch the original Die Hard. If, afterwords, you want more of the explosions, ridiculous scenarios and the bad-ass John McClane, this is the next logical place to go. 7\/10.

The first time I watched Blue Velvet ages ago now, in the early 1990s, my reaction was pretty simple I really didn't like it all that much. I'd been a huge Twin Peaks fan, loved the funny-quirky characters and stylized-stiff acting, found myself mesmerized by all that weird dialogue and dark beauty. Blue Velvet had all this too, but it also made me deeply, deeply uncomfortable, graphic and Extremely disturbing. Its sadomasochistic, violent sex scenes and bizarre, fragile leading lady (Isabella Rossellini as Dorothy) on the verge of a breakdown -- all that strange freakiness made me squirm and cover my eyes. It took a long time before I could force myself to sit down and watch this supposed classic again. Whether it was just that I was better prepared to be disturbed or just that I'm a little older and no longer demand that all movies deliver barrels of ha-has, this time around, Blue Velvet drew me in. True, its subject matter makes it hard to watch, but its lush aesthetic beauty means you can't take your eyes away no matter how much you might think you want to. And this, of course, is the point the superficial pleasantness of suburbia has never been stripped away in quite so memorable and vivid a manner.In Blue Velvet, Lynch makes us look beyond the immaculate green lawns, tidy, cosy homes and apple-cheeked smiling neighbors, and question what all that bland niceness might be hiding - perverted evil. He and his fine cast &#150; notably a positively scary-loony Dennis Hopper (in his most famous role) and a campily wonderful Dean Stockwell &#150; do such a good job of getting us to dig beneath the surface that by film's end, it's those flawless lawns that start to look a little creepy they're so manicured, so fake, in their perfect prettiness. A lazy popcorn flick this certainly isn't, but there's no question Blue Velvet offers a truly different take on the same-old tired murder mystery genre, and serves up a thought-provoking skewering of small-town romanticism on the side...something that has spawned a heap of imitators.

But to say this is terrible and painful to watch would be untrue &#150; it's bad but it's that B-Movie bad that keeps the film on that thin line between watchable and un-watchable. Barb Wire is a film that is so audacious in its ideas and settings that it has to set itself further into the future to compensate for its obscure nature and content. What I'm referring to is the corrupt government run country that is the USA since they're into their second civil war It was the Second American Civil War and the world had gone to sh*t. says Barbara Kopetski (Anderson). Oh right, the 'world' has gone down the pan too has it? I shouldn't think anything was wrong with anything else elsewhere, love (or should that be 'babe'?) In this world, the government officials wear Nazi-like uniforms complete with caps and cloaks; all the civilians apparently wear bondage gear and I think I even spied some of the customs officers early on using AK47 machine guns a favoured gun\/symbol of guerrilla and communist warfare. I was puzzled about the bondage gear If Steel Harbour is the only free city left in America and people are walking around in clothing that signifies the pleasure of being restrained, then what are all the other 'un-free' cities like? I suppose they must be the sorts of places where murder is legal or something. Anyway, Barb Wire is a film that places itself in history. It's a story about a hard bodied female hero going mano-on-mano with other men in a violent nature. Reagan's term had ended; the cold war had finished we didn't need any more anti communist Rambo films; we didn't need any more films like Rocky IV where hard bodied American and Russian men beat the hell out of each other and we didn't need anymore western supremacy in the form of muscle man Schwarzenegger kicking arse in his films of the 1980s. No; Barb Wire is about a woman, written BY a woman but generally comes off as a bit of a dud.The actual idea for this film on paper is nothing more than a B-Movie action film wanting to get made. Its premise of a leather clad hero out 'kicking ass' and rounding up all the dregs whilst living in a sadomasochist's wet-dream is the general theme of the film &#150; it's so watered down and one dimensional in its premise that it needs to rip off Casablanca to get across any sort of plot. Barb Wire is a series of scenes from the beginning up until the forty minute mark consisting of Barb seducing, fighting, cuffing and knocking out men dressed in gimp suits with over-sized paddles - OK, well that last example only happens once but it's still there. Once it seems there is an actual narrative to be told in Barb Wire, the film cools down a bit and relies on Barb to narrate what's going on and how she's feeling in true noir style; needless to say it's more funny than entertaining. I don't usual write or talk about acting in a film because it's not something I usually notice; plus who am I to slate someone's acting? If I tried what they're doing I'd probably be awful but Pamela Anderson in this film deserves a special mention. Her eyebrows, eyes and lips do her acting here as she quivers and flexes these parts of her face in a vain and painful attempt to get across some sort of mood or emotion as to what Barb is actually feeling. Along with this, she talks in a low and gruff manner than just oozes the sort of accent you'd probably get on a phone sex line.I know you cannot take a film like Barb Wire seriously but usually when I get this feeling, it's because the film has been aimed at a child audience. This film is anything but aimed for a child audience Anderson struts around in a series of costumes; each one different as the settings change. There are extensive shots of her night club named 'Hammerhead' as Gothic bands and dancers hang out, have fights and dance. There is even room for some apparent squaddies dressed in their normal soldier gear to make an appearance but why they're there, I just don't know. While we are spared horrid, juvenile rock music that is being spurted out from the band (you'd think music would've evolved a little by 2017) for long enough; you cannot escape the obvious references to S&M as women walk around in corsets, boots up to their knees and wear sunglasses indoors. I was surprised there weren't a few scenes set in a makeshift dungeon inter-cut with these tracking shots. Maybe Barb could expand her business and set up some bondage facilities might earn her some money on the side. After all, why would everyone where what they wear in public anyway? Incidentally, when one woman in being 'tortured' by the government very early on via electric shocks; she is moaning in sheer delight, not pain, at the activity.But above all this, the film lets itself down on a technical level. The bad guy's target is right there in front of him and when the scanner fails, he lets them go despite up to this point checking everyone's I.D. card for good measure. He doesn't check these individual's cards because the film would've ended right there! The 'search' of Barb's club is also more of a ransack ale kegs are shot to bits and shelves housing glasses are crashed to the floor you never know, the missing thing could be there(!)

The interesting part is the conclusion, which could turn out in a myriad of ways. This premise reminds me of Lean's later epic, Dr. Zhivago (although the woman and men roles are reversed in it), but is much more centralized.The film's cast is very small, mainly focused on three characters. Laura Jesson is the woman in question, who is a completely typical person. The whole film is narrated by her and witnesses from her viewpoint. My favorite character is her husband, Fred Jesson. He is a trusting and laid back man, who is usually seen working on crossword puzzles. Laura realizes that she is not getting the satisfaction she wants from the marriage after meeting Dr. Alec Harvey at a train stop. He is a woman's man caring, handsome, intelligent, and personal. Throughout the film, we get to see Laura frequently visit Dr. Harvey, which puts her loyalty to Fred into question.The film started off slowly, but became much more interesting after the first twenty minutes or so. It is very dialog and narration heavy, which is hard to understand at first but gets clearer along the way. To add some flavor, classical music is often used to accompany the scenes.I was unsure if I would like Brief Encounter before watching it (and even as I started watching it), but I ended up liking it very much. The story is rather simple, but is fluently put together and interesting. It also helps that the characters are easy to relate to. If you don't mind a little older black and white film, then I would encourage you to watch it.

Thompson and Branagh are perfectly cast and just light up the screen.I am rather biased seeing as this is my favourite Shakespeare play - with the possible exception of The Taming of the Shrew - and i find the romantic plot line sensational. The chemistry between Beatrice and Benedick is wonderful; sparks really fly off one another when each is still in 'hatred' zone and when they finally confess their love they really seem to mean it. This is helped by the fact that Branagh and Thompson were actually married at the time of filming so one could truly imagine that these actors were passionate about each other.I agreed with previous comments about Keanu Reeves' poor performance when first watching the film; he was rather wooden; but having seen other productions of this play i have realised that Don John is a shallow and bland character and therefore Keanu's attempt wasn't too appalling.Overall a great effort and i think that this is just one of those films i will re-watch constantly and never get bored.If you're a fan of this play i do recommend the BBC updated version of it from the 2005 ShakespeaRetold series, because although it is nowhere near the quality of the Branagh version, it does maintain the spirit of the original play and is a really enjoyable watch.
