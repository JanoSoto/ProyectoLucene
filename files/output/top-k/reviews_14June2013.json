[{"date":"14 June 2013","score":"","review":" Firstly, I want to say this is a beautiful story, a interesting animation, a deep thinking with its lovely dubbing. The outline of this story is clear and ordinary, but it will not let you down at any moment. Due to its almost perfect continuity and obvious but not boring plot, it is easy for children to follow and to wet their eyes, especially when our iron giant said Superman and then took care the bomb; just like the plot in How to Train Your Dragon (2010), it is a sacrifice in the end, however, everything will be fine at the final end.Furthermore, with this simple story which is logical but not novel, The Iron Giant really teaches us something. The unknown things are always considered dangerous and scared, it is absurd and what the author wants to throw down by this film. When Hogarth helped the iron giant to get rid of the electric cable, the next day our giant show him the friendly. Him, not it, said by a little boy shows us a warm world although it is frozen winter in the film. He is like a baby, when he is hungry, he has only iron in his mind, when he find it is interesting to jump into the water, he plays like a children; You are not him (the machine killer), you are like superman, just like teaching a child, good teaching grows up a reasonable boy.Finally, the most worth thinking about is guns kill, is this a enlightenment telling giant you are a gun of killing, wake up, or a word to tell him do not be the gun killing innocence, even though you possess the power. Actually, clues for both of them can be found, but of course, the later one is what the film wants to say.Just an cute animation, too much thinking for it...... LoL!
