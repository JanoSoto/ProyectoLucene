Well yes it was folks, and to prepare for making their Jack the Ripper flick they watched Bram Stoker's Dracula about a million times, and ripped off almost everything but the plot.There is much poetic license taken here, apparently it is based upon a fictionalised comic book version that I have never heard of, but then realistically I haven't heard about any comic that hasn't already been made into a movie.What I like is that it opens with a quote from good ole Jack himself, considering no-one knows who he is that seems a huge leap of faith.So to summarise The Hughes Brothers' version, Jack is not a random hack'n'slash guy roaming the back streets, but a calculated intelligent and skilled surgeon hell-bent on killing specific targets. In this case a sextet of hookers led by Mary Kelly, played by Heather Graham, yup good 'ole Rollergirl herself.Now I've heard that Heather absolutely butchers the English accent in this, but as I am not especially familiar with the particulars of the dialect I can't be sure. As an Australian I can definitely tell when someone is massacring the Oz accent, so I guess the best people to ask would be British locals.Now these hookers owe some seedy guys from the Nicholls Street gang some cash, and more than 6 scrags can make in reasonable time at their trade. The boss of the gang McQueen is hanging around in menacing fashion, basically providing a nice red herring suspect for the early stages.This is sorta the first 10 minutes of the flick, and is real confusing, especially if you aren't paying attention, but in reality it matters not a zack, as aside from showing that the hookers are buddies it means nothing.Shortly after we have the first kill, one of the hookers is found minus some vital lady bits and a fair bit of blood. So we finally get to meet Johnny Depp as Inspector Abaline, and his Sergeant played by Robbie Coltrane.Now a digression I should hate Johnny Depp, he is pretty, bangs supermodels, is rich, and was famous and cocky when very young. I should hate and boycott Johnny Depp movies just like I hate Tom Cruise, Richard Gere and Hugh Grant. But I don't.Why? I tried to find out why by looking at his IMDb page, and what I came up with was that over his whole career he has never once made a film that was obviously just for the cash. Beside this he has latched on to Tim Burton, one of the most consistently interesting directors over the last 20 odd years, which means every few years he will have a film released that I will likely see.Back to Hell. Aberline is a little bit of an opium addict, and dabbles with other nasties too, so much so that he has visions of what is likely to happen in the future regarding the hookers. Now I drink - often to excess - and even though I am not fortunate enough to have visions (if anything I lose memories I already have) I would think it extremely fortunate to have visions of people I have never met, but will soon.More kills ensue and it's 3 down, 3 to go. Turns out that the hookers, being poor and unfortunate, cannot afford luxuries like fruit, so they are lured to their doom with the temptation of grapes. This works apparently on almost every occasion, so it is obvious too that they are poor, unfortunate&#x85; and stupid.So Aberline, working on a hunch, goes to meet some noted surgeons in the hope that they could enlighten his theory that an educated and trained man is doing the killing further. There he meets Bilbo Baggins, I mean the Royal surgeon and physician Dr Gull, who confirms and supports his theory.Without delving further and giving away too much there is a key subplot which eventually somewhat clumsily becomes intertwined with the key story, there are cover ups, secret orders and societies, red herrings and short-term suspects and corruption at the highest level. Basically everything a grown boy needs.Ultimately the film unmasks the real killer, or at least this version's killer, and while it is at least ballsy that they decide to name one guy and come up with a motive and backstory, it does feel very much like a flimsy attempt at a plausible story. There must have been hundreds of leaps of faith taken to piece the thing together from scratch, and if one or two of those aren't in fact true which is likely the case the whole house of cards falls.But did I like it? Not really, it was OK and vaguely interesting from start to finish, but I never really cared who lived or died, and there was no scene that was especially memorable over the whole 2 odd hours.Except&#x85; That I watched Bram Stoker's Dracula a few months back, and I tell ya From Hell has so many similarities in feel, tone and vision that if you watched them back to back you might think they were part of a series.Seriously, that's all I can remember, is someone asks me next week I'll say It reminds me of Bram Stoker's Dracula.

I honestly don't see what all the hubub is about. I'll try to keep the bashing to a minimum and say that I just didn't like this movie all that much, yet I am a fan of westerns and have seen my fair share of them. True Grit is about a fourteen year old girl named Mattie Ross (Kim Darby) who employs the hardboiled and drunken Marshall Rooster Cogburn, played by John Wayne in his only Oscar winning performance, to hunt down the killer of her father, Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey). They get the help of a Texas ranger named La Boeuf (Glenn Campbell) who has been chasing Chaney for nearly four months. What ensues is your typical adventure movie that is more focused on character than actual plot. I normally wouldn't have a problem with this, except John Wayne is the only interesting character of the bunch. I truly didn't feel anything for the other characters and Kim Darby annoyed the ever loving crap out of me. If you enjoy the obnoxious, spoiled, and rude brat character, you'll love True Grit.From a plot standpoint, True Grit has little going for it. The first hour and a half of the movie is basically just an annoying little kid demanding she get her way whenever she wants. At first I was amazed by how serious all the characters took such a little brat, but I came to realize that they only appeased her to shut her up. So really what I thought was ridiculous ended being a good choice between the lesser of two evils. True Grit is supposed to be a character study of sorts and the only place I really see this is John Wayne's character, Rooster Cogburn. He goes through a wholehearted character change through working with a girl who seems to point out all his flaws and doesn't back down because thats what she does. He begins the movie likable because of his hard-nosed and sarcastic attitude, displaying the traits of a grumpy old man who didn't care what other people thought about him, which is what John Wayne had become at this point (he was 63 when this was released and would pass away 10 years later). By the end of the film he learns a lot about himself, but still retains his all American likability. And, to me, that was the extent of the characterization, and there was only a sub-par story to back it up.All this being said, True Grit has its aspects that are great for entertainment value. It was shot in some very beautiful landscape out in Colorado, and the direction showcases this nicely. It is also an overall fun film. John Wayne displays a lot of great humor in his sarcastic western tone that he had perfected like no other. The character of Reuben J. 'Rooster' Cogburn is a fun character that is easy to enjoy on screen, especially when he's portrayed by one of the most beloved men in cinema history. That being said, I almost feel like Wayne's Oscar win was only to make up for all the times he was robbed of the Oscar in the past, because I can think of plenty of other films where he deserved the win more than True Grit (Stagecoach, The Searchers, and The Cowboys to name a few). Still, it would have been criminal for John Wayne to not win an Oscar in his lifetime, so better True Grit than nothing at all.True Grit's other Oscar nomination was for original score, and deservedly so. As per most classic westerns, True Grit has a fantastic score that heightens every moment of the film at least some. Overall this film isn't great. There are many other westerns I would recommend before watching this one, but I didn't hate it. I strongly disliked certain parts *ahemKimDarbyahem* but it definitely has its moments. John Wayne is fun and lovable as always, but again, there are many other John Wayne films I would recommend before this one.

He was great in Tremors, over the top but never less than interesting in Hollow Man, and terrific in the understated The Woodsman. So it should be no surprise here that he elevates Stir Of Echoes up a little more than perhaps is warranted.Stir of Echoes famously followed The Sixth Sense by a month in 1999, and by that stage the most famous twist since Luke met his Daddy had given Shamalangadingdong's film massive (and well deserved) momentum.But that's for another time. The upshot is that echoes was a little late to the party.The odd thing is that at its core this really is quite similar to The Sixth Sense. Without labouring the point this didn't help it too much critically and in the box office, when you've just seen one of the definitive psychological thrillers of all time, why check out something with less buzz and less critical acclaim? This is a minor shame, as Stir of Echoes is more than just OK and the good bits outweigh the bad.The film is set in Chicago, Kevin Bacon plays Tom, blue collar regular-guy husband to Maggie, in the early going we find out that Maggie is pregnant again, much to Tom's concern. Tom finds out when Maggie's sister Lisa blabs, I found Lisa annoying, (but I think you were meant to). The odd thing is that after the new baby is mentioned in the first few minutes of the film it never comes up again, so perhaps it was only introduced at all to convince the audience that Tom and Lisa don't like each other? Even though Tom is clearly in his late 30s and Maggie is pregnant, they get around like a young couple, house parties, baseball games and boozy evenings with friends, it is at one of these evenings in the early hours that Lisa is discussing her hobby, that of hypnotism.

There are a little too many convenient turns and Hollywood clichés for this to be a great movie, but there are certainly some chill inducing moments, and a couple of decent scenes. In retrospect though while one of the chills was good in isolation, after the movie finished I realised that it made no sense when considered in context.Maggie is way too accepting of the situation given the unbelievable circumstances going on around her with Jake and Tom, they see everything, she sees nothing and she just accepts this.Not being from America I have no idea how authentic Bacon's accent was, but to me it sounds incredibly thick and annoying.

Sure she is attractive in a Womanly way, as opposed to the million girl actresses that burst on the scene and vanish seemingly weeks later, but her decision making when saying yes to a movie is obviously abysmal.Thanks to IMDb I can say that these are Kidman's career highlights - Dead Calm (My initial typo said Dead Clam, which I hope to option and sell to Hollywood for a million bucks.) - The Others That's it. I've seen at least a dozen of her other flicks and have been underwhelmed every time. Kidman is good-looking without having that one thing that you remember, a good actress without ever being the most interesting character in any movie that she is in, yet she is critically lauded and extremely well paid.Another thing I am Australian and realise this is almost slanderous that I am fully bagging a fellow Australian success story, but it needs to be said that NICOLE KIDMAN IS INCREDIBLY OVERRATED.Late addition I subsequently checked out Rotten Tomatoes and found that Dead Calm and The Others are 2 of her higher ranked flicks, followed by Eyes Wide Shut, which I have seen but thought was nowhere near as good as it was made out to be.So back to The Others, which after my rant is actually pretty good, more thanks to the simplicity of the story than anything Kidman does though.Set in post-WW2 on a British island, Kidman plays a mother of 2 young kids named Grace living in a massive isolated manor that is seemingly eternally surrounded by fog. Her husband Charlie, was a soldier in the war and hasn't been heard from for some time - perhaps already dead. Her 2 kids are around 4 and 7, the younger a boy named Nicholas and the older a sister named Ann.Grace is understandably very protective of her two children, who apparently have an allergy to natural light (read sunshine), and must remain indoors during the day and behind thick drawn curtains. In fact Grace locks every room behind her to make sure they don't wander out, something that is a bit of a contrived plot device in retrospect.So one day three strangers roll up unannounced at the front door, Grace assumes that they have answered an ad offering work and employs them all instantly.They are Mr Tuttle &#x96; Gardener\/Handyman, perhaps 60. Mrs Mills &#x96; Nanny\/Cook, also about 60. And Lydia &#x96; Maid, around 30 ish and a mute.Grace explains that her previous help vanished, and she takes great pains going through the rules regarding her children to Lydia and Mrs Mills.So one day Grace hears a crying child and immediately assumes it is one of hers. Nuh-huh, they are both OK. Ann blames some other kid named Victor who Grace has never heard of so she punishes Ann for the perceived lie. After mutterings, random noises and scuttling upstairs, it seems evident that someone else is in the house, and after questioning Ann matter of factly explains that there are in fact 4 others including the afore-mentioned Victor.Of course Grace being proper and rational initially doesn't embrace this idea, only as the usual evidence of self closing and opening doors, footsteps, unmanned pianos that play and random voices sorta changes her tune somewhat. She demands that the three servants search the home and grounds for evidence.A bit of an odd turn of events happens about half way through that I won't ruin (though it makes little if any sense), Grace decides to go for help through the fog, but eds up becoming disoriented and lost, until she finds&#x85;..Again I can't say, but it does seem that the hired help know more than they are letting on, and that again someone else is in the house. Aside from Mrs Mills, the help seem to be around more to give the audience and Grace someone to be suspicious of, as elsewise she would be largely jumping at shadows.The Others finishes with a decent turn of events that makes sense given what precedes it, but unlike The Sixth Sense it does not reward repeat viewings for some reason. I had far fonder memories of this film from when I initially saw it in the early part of the decade than after watching it the other night. In essence I realised that it was a film with one scare, that wasn't really scary anyway, and two revelations that are both OK, but once you know 'em you know 'em. There is little joy in revisiting this flick.However&#x85; It does contain one of the (inadvertently I think) funniest lines in film history. Grace is once again seriously discussing things with her kids and in an attempt to comfort Nicholas says You'll never go to war., to which Nicholas in typical 4 year old fashion replies We never go anywhere. Dunno why, but it cracked me up enough to rewind it twice.Final Rating &#x96; 6.5 \/ 10.

I've seen at least a dozen of her other flicks and have been underwhelmed every time. Kidman is good-looking without having that one thing that you remember, a good actress without ever being the most interesting character in any movie that she is in, yet she is critically lauded and extremely well paid.Another thing I am Australian and realise this is almost slanderous that I am fully bagging a fellow Australian success story, but it needs to be said that NICOLE KIDMAN IS INCREDIBLY OVERRATED.Late addition I subsequently checked out Rotten Tomatoes and found that Dead Calm and The Others are 2 of her higher ranked flicks, followed by Eyes Wide Shut, which I have seen but thought was nowhere near as good as it was made out to be.So back to The Others, which after my rant is actually pretty good, more thanks to the simplicity of the story than anything Kidman does though.Set in post-WW2 on a British island, Kidman plays a mother of 2 young kids named Grace living in a massive isolated manor that is seemingly eternally surrounded by fog. Her husband Charlie, was a soldier in the war and hasn't been heard from for some time - perhaps already dead. Her 2 kids are around 4 and 7, the younger a boy named Nicholas and the older a sister named Ann.Grace is understandably very protective of her two children, who apparently have an allergy to natural light (read sunshine), and must remain indoors during the day and behind thick drawn curtains. In fact Grace locks every room behind her to make sure they don't wander out, something that is a bit of a contrived plot device in retrospect.So one day three strangers roll up unannounced at the front door, Grace assumes that they have answered an ad offering work and employs them all instantly.They are Mr Tuttle &#x96; Gardener\/Handyman, perhaps 60. Mrs Mills &#x96; Nanny\/Cook, also about 60. And Lydia &#x96; Maid, around 30 ish and a mute.Grace explains that her previous help vanished, and she takes great pains going through the rules regarding her children to Lydia and Mrs Mills.So one day Grace hears a crying child and immediately assumes it is one of hers. Nuh-huh, they are both OK. Ann blames some other kid named Victor who Grace has never heard of so she punishes Ann for the perceived lie. After mutterings, random noises and scuttling upstairs, it seems evident that someone else is in the house, and after questioning Ann matter of factly explains that there are in fact 4 others including the afore-mentioned Victor.Of course Grace being proper and rational initially doesn't embrace this idea, only as the usual evidence of self closing and opening doors, footsteps, unmanned pianos that play and random voices sorta changes her tune somewhat. She demands that the three servants search the home and grounds for evidence.A bit of an odd turn of events happens about half way through that I won't ruin (though it makes little if any sense), Grace decides to go for help through the fog, but eds up becoming disoriented and lost, until she finds&#x85;..Again I can't say, but it does seem that the hired help know more than they are letting on, and that again someone else is in the house. Aside from Mrs Mills, the help seem to be around more to give the audience and Grace someone to be suspicious of, as elsewise she would be largely jumping at shadows.The Others finishes with a decent turn of events that makes sense given what precedes it, but unlike The Sixth Sense it does not reward repeat viewings for some reason. I had far fonder memories of this film from when I initially saw it in the early part of the decade than after watching it the other night. In essence I realised that it was a film with one scare, that wasn't really scary anyway, and two revelations that are both OK, but once you know 'em you know 'em. There is little joy in revisiting this flick.However&#x85; It does contain one of the (inadvertently I think) funniest lines in film history. Grace is once again seriously discussing things with her kids and in an attempt to comfort Nicholas says You'll never go to war., to which Nicholas in typical 4 year old fashion replies We never go anywhere. Dunno why, but it cracked me up enough to rewind it twice.Final Rating &#x96; 6.5 \/ 10.

It's indescribably beautiful, one of the most gorgeous Westerns ever photographed, indeed a model for good visual directing and cinematography in any genre. That alone makes the almost three hours a pure pleasure.But it's not a fast movie in any other way. It can't be. It depends on lingering over delicious details, small ones, shot up close in startling detail and ever deadpan looks and steely eyes. Nothing is believable and it's not meant to be. It's not even a fable, quite, but more a celebration of being inside an incredible film, as strange as that sounds. Not that the scenes are not believable--even the very last shots of the makeshift town and the railroad being built is about as realistic as it gets. Great stuff.Plot? You might, at times, wonder where the plot went. There are lots of bad guys, and you're not totally sure there's a protagonist, unless the one woman in the movie is the center of our concerns, even if she is clearly a bystander to it all. When it gets clear, in the last twenty minutes, it's again archetypal (and has echoes of the over the tops showdown in Good Bad and Ugly). A small bit of slow motion (not needed normally in a movie where everything is slow already) makes clear this is the key moment in the film, the thing that made the rest of it, with all its confusing and violent layers, sensible.For my money, I'd love all this incredible visceral stuff, the sounds and sights, filled in with some kind of deeply felt conflict, not a purely dramatic one. I watch and am shocked, or swept away, or impressed, or dazzled, but I'm actually never moved, not from the heart. And there are plenty of aspects here that should really move us--including feeling for the woman's plight, rather than simply recognizing that it is, after all, quite a plight.Still, another landmark Sergio Leone movie.

It's got a mad villain with an insane looking undersea secret base, a sexy Russian spy called Agent Triple X, an unflappable silent movie giant henchman who bites through anything and anyone that gets in his way, a supercool Lotus Elise which turns into an underwater submersible, not one but two classic Hammer Films babes (Munro and Leon) and a humungous oil tanker which eats submarines. In terms of plausibility it may be a tad lacking, but for sheer jaw-dropping action entertainment it's rarely been topped, with a stunning ski-chase opening, a memorable fight in the Abu Simbel temples, a fantastic car\/motorbike\/helicopter chase along the Costa Smeralda and a huge finale dust-up in villain Stromberg's vast Atlantis base. Ken Adam's production design, particularly for the latter, is just breathtaking in its scope and grandiose comic-book stylings - Adam built the largest soundstage in the world, flooded with a million gallons of water, for the amazing sequences where the subs are captured by the Liparus. Okay so the movie may have a few too many jokes about sexual proclivity and the plot doesn't really bear much scrutiny, but it's everything a Bond movie should be; stylish, action-packed, exotic escapist fantasy, transporting you to some glamorous other-worldly universe of spies, arch-villains, wild gadgets, dangerous women and international intrigue. It's sensational, with a great cast, terrific photography, neato special effects (by Derek Meddings) and a goofily enjoyable string-disco score featuring one of the most memorable theme songs of the series (Nobody Does It Better). Everyone has their own favourite Bond films and eras, but I think this one is pretty undeniably one of the best (both Moore and producer Albert Broccoli cited it as a favourite). Some weird trivia; there is a gaffe in the end credits citing For Your Eyes Only as the next film in the series (it was actually Moonraker), Stanley Kubrick was an uncredited lighting \/ technical consultant on the big stage shots, and by most accounts this was the last movie Elvis Presley saw. Shot in Egypt, Canada, Scotland, Sardinia and at Pinewood Studios, this is blockbuster British action cinema at its best.

It's got a mad villain with an insane looking undersea secret base, a sexy Russian spy called Agent Triple X, an unflappable silent movie giant henchman who bites through anything and anyone that gets in his way, a supercool Lotus Elise which turns into an underwater submersible, not one but two classic Hammer Films babes (Munro and Leon) and a humungous oil tanker which eats submarines. In terms of plausibility it may be a tad lacking, but for sheer jaw-dropping action entertainment it's rarely been topped, with a stunning ski-chase opening, a memorable fight in the Abu Simbel temples, a fantastic car\/motorbike\/helicopter chase along the Costa Smeralda and a huge finale dust-up in villain Stromberg's vast Atlantis base. Ken Adam's production design, particularly for the latter, is just breathtaking in its scope and grandiose comic-book stylings - Adam built the largest soundstage in the world, flooded with a million gallons of water, for the amazing sequences where the subs are captured by the Liparus. Okay so the movie may have a few too many jokes about sexual proclivity and the plot doesn't really bear much scrutiny, but it's everything a Bond movie should be; stylish, action-packed, exotic escapist fantasy, transporting you to some glamorous other-worldly universe of spies, arch-villains, wild gadgets, dangerous women and international intrigue. It's sensational, with a great cast, terrific photography, neato special effects (by Derek Meddings) and a goofily enjoyable string-disco score featuring one of the most memorable theme songs of the series (Nobody Does It Better). Everyone has their own favourite Bond films and eras, but I think this one is pretty undeniably one of the best (both Moore and producer Albert Broccoli cited it as a favourite). Some weird trivia; there is a gaffe in the end credits citing For Your Eyes Only as the next film in the series (it was actually Moonraker), Stanley Kubrick was an uncredited lighting \/ technical consultant on the big stage shots, and by most accounts this was the last movie Elvis Presley saw.

A movie about Rocky as a father, trainer, with no fight in a ring at the end, only in the street, bringing back the champion to his roots, and his senses. But, it wasn't wholly flawless.There are too many bad performances; the real-life boxer (Tommy Morrison), as (Tommy Gunn), looked like a moving wall, with bad acting yet I can't blame him alone while the script gave him so little to be convincing as a character. (Richard Gant) as (George Washington Duke) was bad, just bad, he lacked the soul to be that mean talkative merchant. And (Sylvester Stallone) himself showed uneven efforts; sometimes he's so fine (as in the movie's start), and sometimes he's annoying, with exaggerated moving and talking (at one of the basement's scenes he delivered a perfect Razzie material !).The script was doing so well, mostly during the first half, however many forced matters hurt the final product. The way that newcomer boxer hated his mentor seemed fast. The way the reporters smashed his win into pieces as fixed looked highly fixed itself (hard to believe the line of one of them Fight your cheap lady in the front row better ?!!). Then the way he went to challenge his trainer ?? Obviously all of that was done by the writer, more than his characters. Therefore this is the first (Rocky) movie to lack persuasion.I don't buy for a second that the old bastard coach (Burgess Meredith as Mickey) says that long sentimental speech in the flashback. Not his stony personality, or his verbal dictionary. I even don't think that he, in his most intimate moments, talks for this long. He could have said all of that in one short line or eloquent gesture. And finally there are too many photomontages, and too many what's behind your ear? brinks as well ! Generally, while the script is smart at places, it's not in many other, and that's the main problem here.The good side contains the preferential soundtrack of (Bill Conti). It brings back a sensitive side to the characters. True it isn't that intensive unless in the last 10 minutes, but that's due to the nature of this sequel. Notice well the way Rocky's theme is heard at the climax, with techno\/Orchestral arrangement. That wasn't done only to avoid any bore out of reusing the old theme, but also to express that Rocky can be hip, and forever master, especially while he beats, rather chastises, a street kid who belongs to a more modern time than his.(Talia Shire) as (Adrian), and (Burt Young) as (Paulie) must have taken the Oscar. They don't act at all, being too realistic to scary extent. Watching them being their characters is one of a kind treat. Sorrowfully I can't say the same about the majority of that cast ! The climactic sequence really sums up the best of the movie, or it is the best of it indeed. Despite being based on dramatically weak start, its outcome is a classic piece of cinema which I enjoy apart. And on a deeper level it shows who the true (Rocky) is, as a very simple guy who wants to overcome the ugly circumstances, where his goal isn't money or fame; it is assuring his talent without questions, to defeat his shortcomings as not so bright man, and have the victory of the pure gift when it wants nothing but the pure recognition.(Rocky) here was sort of fighting an opposite young version of himself. The young (Rocky) was in love spiritually (his religiousness) and emotionally (his Adrian). However that young champ (Tommy Gunn) is in love materialistically only. And while (Rocky) was driven by the desire of being somebody matters with dignity, beating his dumb image, (Gunn) is driven by his anger and hate, beating the image of his dad endlessly. That's why that sequence for me is, somehow, the whole movie. It showcased the title character perfectly, along with &#x96; maybe &#x96; the new generation of the talented ones, being bewitched by the wrong lights. It's only the remark of the promoter George Washington Duke, Only in America, that seems irrelevant. As if it is only a way to assure the connection between such a character and the real-life promoter Don King, using his famous catchphrase.It has one of the most brilliant moments, where the movie deepens into his character to discover a gem of a meaning. I'm talking about the final scene in which (Rocky) goes with his son to watch a (Picasso), saying about that artiest I almost love everybody as if the simple human, that (Rocky) is, can be, with his pure nature, as great as Picasso, thinking the same way, saying the same quote, yet naturally and without much sophisticatedness. If only the rest of the movie was as good !Yes, not that classic as the first, without as effective story. But (Rocky V) managed to beat its shortcomings, to be 60% good vs. 40 % not good. Let alone being so nostalgic for any fan of the classic, first 2, (Rocky) movies.

This was his first film lead, and he possesses it like he'd been acting straight out of the womb. And the movie's closing shot is as brassy and lemon-tart as anything before it, a gutsy and magnetic two-minute close-up of Hoskins' contorting Chevy Chase as his mince pies avert back and forth, and his mouth fractures into a petrified roof tile. This full-on Monty is a right blinding time, not just for the Hoskins performance but also for the understated vim of Mackenzie's direction, the full-of-beans music, and, despite what you'd Adam-and-Eve, for the charming delicacy of when it occasionally decides to take the mickey bliss out of you.

Basically it has been six years since both psycho killer Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur) and his niece, daughter of the supposedly dead Laurie Strode, Jamie were seen in the town of Haddonfield, but they are very much alive. Now teenage Jamie Lloyd Carruthers (J.C. Brandy) was raped by a cult and gives birth to her baby boy on Halloween Eve, she manages to hide the baby, and alerts Dr. Sam Loomis (Pleasence), but suffers Michael pushing her into a corn thresher. Back in Haddonfield, Halloween is apparently banned ever since the horrible incidents involving Myers, but some people are still getting the pumpkins and costumes out, and the Myers house has a new family living in it. They are the Strode family, the ones who adopted Laurie, mother Kara (Marianne Hagan) with her teenage brother Tim (Keith Bogart), her son Danny (Devin Gardner), and her parents, doting mother Debra (Kim Darby) and abusive father John (Bradford English). The baby is eventually found by Tommy Doyle (The 40 Year Old Virgin's Paul Rudd), the little boy Laurie babysat for in the first film, now grown up, and he gets the help of the seemingly retired Loomis to help look after it. Tommy believes that he has an explanation for why Michael is killing people, specifically on Halloween and from his own family bloodline, apparently he is cursed by what is called the Thorn (which he has the symbol of scarred on him), with voices telling him to kill. Soon enough Michael is back in Haddonfield on Halloween to kill the Strodes and anyone else who gets in his way, and Dr. Terence Wynn (Liar Liar's Mitchell 'Mitch' Ryan) reveals himself as the man who wants to almost help him in his quest, he's the guy that was in black from the previous film. In the end, after a few chases and deaths, Michael is eventually stopped (for a while) with tranquilisers of corrosive chemicals and a lead pipe beating to the head, and Loomis is the final (overheard) victim from the still living killer. Also starring Mariah O'Brien as Beth. It is such a shame that Pleasence's time on screen is so short (the director removed some stuff claiming he was boring!), and of course his being in a rubbish film is tragic. Michael Myers may have a better mask and still be creepy, I may have jumped once, and enjoyed the death with a guy's head exploding, but we don't want explanation in a stupid storyline, it is just predictable and silly, like most of the sequels before it, a terrible horror.
