And while it's is not without flaw (and indeed, there are many), The Matrix is so refreshingly original and delightfully entertaining, that many problems can be overlooked. What cannot be overlooked, however, is the final 5 minutes, which is among the worst endings in memory.Spoiling as little as possible (though it's rare to find someone these days that haven't yet see this film), The Matrix creates the idea that the world we live in, is not real. It is, in fact, something called, The Matrix. The audience explores the true world with the protagonist, Thomas A. Anderson, as he struggles to comprehend the extent of this revolutionary discovery.The concept is terribly fascinating. It's hard to explain anything at all without spoiling things, but it is ingenious. Many have argued that it's not entirely original, and I agree, there are definitely elements lifted from other Sci-Fi films, but they're arranged in such a way (and given enough subtle changes) to make a satisfying and intriguing concept.The story is complex, and confusion is almost necessary. The film possesses an almost dream-like quality, in which little makes sense (likely intentionally). Scenes cut to and fro with little transition or fanfare, adding to the dream-like aesthetic of the film. One would be forgiven for criticizing the film for suggesting far too many questions (and supporting them with far too few answers). And while it is a tad irksome, many of these questions are probably better left to the imagination. Other notable flaws include some expository lines (that do a poor job of concealing themselves), and some weak writing at times.But the biggest problem with this film (and the only really significant detriment) is the ending; specifically the last 5 minutes. To explain everything that's problematic with the ending would take a far greater deal of time than anyone has to write nor read about. Never mind the fact that this is a spoiler-free review!To put it as simply and spoiler-free as possible, the ending is inconclusive. Not in the way that inspires sequels (though this film has spawned two add-ons to date), but rather, it doesn't resolve anything. The dilemma created at the beginning of the film is not dealt with, and the film doesn't acknowledge this. Even had it been left as a cliffhanger for a sequel, I might have forgiven it. But instead, it looks at the sky and whistles innocently, completely ignoring the fact that it's fascinating concept has been left alone. In fact, after the concept is established, The Matrix reverts to a high-level heist film - that is still engrossing, and smashingly put together, but it's lacking the brilliance that it initially promises.On top of that, the ending gives way to a lot of conveniences and cop- outs, and is both very un-cinematic, and highly anti-climatic. There are a good number of action sequences, and they are exceptionally crafted, though there are certainly too many of them. The Kung-Fu is cool, and even some of the shoot 'em ups are neat, but they become exhausting after a while. And one can only watch nameless henchmen miss the protagonists so much before becoming skeptical. Also, the gratuitous amount of slo-mo just comes across as dated, and the excessive amount of destruction in the last hour just makes the film seem like it's trying too hard; especially when there's a very interesting concept that feels like it's been ignored in favor of said action and destruction. Still, there's an excellent chase sequence at the very end that's among the best in recent memory.Keanu Reeves is engaging in the lead, and Laurence Fishburne is solid alongside Reeves (though he talks in an odd, robotic way - perhaps intentionally). Hugo Weaving also has an odd speech pattern in the role of the antagonist, though he pulls it off much better. He's as menacing as Sci-Fi villains get. The supporting cast is good, but not great (Matt Doran as Mouse fares the best).Don Davis' score does what a good score does; and that is improve the film. Many scenes are significantly improved through Davis' music, as it provides tension and texture. Though it occasionally gives way to too much drums and not enough melody, it's an admirable effort that gets the job done.The Matrix is the kind of film one can talk about for days. It has a lot of depth and substance, and the plot is hugely complex and open for interpretation. And yet, the pros and cons also merit discussion. The Matrix scores a lot of points by simply being entertaining, smart, and original. But the ending is so hugely unsatisfying that the 2 hours preceding the final five minutes is nearly undone as a result of its incompetence. The Matrix is a weird, wild ride. It's just a shame that the payoff (if it can be called that) is so abysmally weak.

It was too long, too ponderous, too interested in its dull new characters. The good news is that 'Star Trek II' fixes some of those mistakes. The bad news is - for me anyway, and I'm aware that this isn't the general consensus - I still find the film dull as hell.In the interest of full disclosure I should mention that I used to enjoy most iterations of 'Star Trek' but the whole thing bores the tits off me these days; that said, I never liked this movie even when I was the proud owner of a signed photo of Robert Beltran. The first few films are weirdly sterile, tucked in at the corners in terms of production design, plodding and self-conscious. They're frickin' tedious, is what. This one sequelises an episode of the TV show by bringing back one of its most famous villains it's Khan (Ricardo Montalban) from 'Space Seed', all wrathful because Kirk left him stranded on a planet years earlier. The planet was knocked out of orbit soon after Khan and his crew arrived, turning it into an inhospitable desert - and now Khan wants revenge.In an extraordinary stroke of luck for old Khan the only indigenous life on the planet is a mind-controlling worm, which comes in handy when a craft piloted by Chekov lands nearby; Khan plonks a worm in Chekov's ear and uses him to lure Kirk into a trap. Khan is also after the Genesis project, developed by Kirk's ex Carol and her son David (you probably know where this is going). And so the old adversaries face off and try to outwit each other in not very interesting ways, kicking off a three- movie arc that comes to a close in 'Star Trek IV'.Like the first movie, this spends far too much time making a meal out of scenes that could be told far more economically. Was it really necessary to spend the duration of an episode setting up Khan's plan and getting Kirk back on the bridge of the Enterprise? And like the first movie there's an emphasis on showing the Enterprise in the middle of shiny effects sequences without a strong plot to provide an interesting context. Ships shoot at each other a lot, yes yes. First Khan outwits Kirk and shoots at him. Then Kirk outwits Khan and shoots at him. Then Khan outwits Kirk and... you get the idea. Khan starts to look less like a fearsome adversary and more like a frustrated kid who isn't getting his own way, while Kirk's resolutions to every problem are too easy and limp. On the plus side, the regular cast get a lot more to do than in the first movie, and their characters are well written. The banter between Kirk, Spock and Bones livens things up a bit, and there are some nice moments between Spock and Vulcan trainee Saavik (Kirstie Alley). So it's a shame that the more interesting ideas in the movie don't really go anywhere, like the subplot with Kirk and David, which is so underwhelming they may as well not have bothered. And once Khan's plan gets underway, Montalban doesn't get much to do besides sit in a chair being so fiendish someone should have given him a waxed moustache to twiddle. It all does nothing for me at all. Sorry.

For a while, I didn't think much of the movie, as I didn't think it was supposed to be very good. However, after reading Roger Ebert's praising review, I decided to check it out. 2 hours and 20 minutes later, I was amazed. How is this movie not talked about more? This is easily one of Spike Lee's best films, along with Do the Right Thing and 25th Hour. A small detail that tells a lot about what to expect is the film's title. Most people expected a profile of the Son of Sam serial killer. However, the movie is called SUMMER of Sam, which tells what the film is about. It's about the time period and the paranoia that gripped New York during the killings, not the killer himself. There are several scenes showing the killer's life, who is played excellently by underrated actor Michael Baddalucco, but these scenes do not take up the majority of the film. Though he isn't the main character, the film belongs to Adrien Brody as wannabe punk rocker Richie, who is slowly believed to be the Son of Sam by his paranoid friends. His performance is eccentric, dramatic, and just close enough to over-the-top to be believable. The film's best sequence is about halfway through the film, in which Richie rocks out to The Who in his garage, and the scene is dazzlingly intercut with Richie moonlighting as a dancer in a sleazy club and the killer doing his business. I must also give a large applause to the film's top notch editing and soundtrack which play a big part in making the film unique. Despite any negative reviews you've heard, I highly recommend this film for any fan of unique thrillers and Spike Lee's other work.

However, after reading Roger Ebert's praising review, I decided to check it out. 2 hours and 20 minutes later, I was amazed. How is this movie not talked about more? This is easily one of Spike Lee's best films, along with Do the Right Thing and 25th Hour. A small detail that tells a lot about what to expect is the film's title. Most people expected a profile of the Son of Sam serial killer. However, the movie is called SUMMER of Sam, which tells what the film is about. It's about the time period and the paranoia that gripped New York during the killings, not the killer himself. There are several scenes showing the killer's life, who is played excellently by underrated actor Michael Baddalucco, but these scenes do not take up the majority of the film. Though he isn't the main character, the film belongs to Adrien Brody as wannabe punk rocker Richie, who is slowly believed to be the Son of Sam by his paranoid friends. His performance is eccentric, dramatic, and just close enough to over-the-top to be believable. The film's best sequence is about halfway through the film, in which Richie rocks out to The Who in his garage, and the scene is dazzlingly intercut with Richie moonlighting as a dancer in a sleazy club and the killer doing his business. I must also give a large applause to the film's top notch editing and soundtrack which play a big part in making the film unique. Despite any negative reviews you've heard, I highly recommend this film for any fan of unique thrillers and Spike Lee's other work.

I wanted to see Kids, however, because it sounded like one of those really screwed up films that's so bad you shouldn't watch it, yet you can't look away. Well, in a way, that is what Kids is. I finally rented the film a few weeks ago and watched it. Let me just say, with a single viewing, I had mixed feelings. I didn't expect what I saw. I am not a prude person by any means, but all the graphic sex talk between the teenagers was a bit much. It was so descriptive and realistic to the point that it was almost too realistic to be real, if that makes any sense at all. However, after some thinking, I realized this movie is depicting the way some kids really live. There are kids who talk about sex all day, come from really screwed up families, and sleep with everyone in sight. The sad truth is that this is one of the most realistic films you can find out there today. This may sound like a stretch, but I feel like it should almost be shown in schools (with permission slips, of course) because if you want a movie that can really scare the crap out of teenagers into using protection and not sleeping around, I feel like this movie can do it. Kids is shown more like a documentary than a work of fiction and is so realistic you feel like you're watching truth. 8 out of 10 stars.

Are we really supposed to be scared by such hackneyed routines as the hand-on-the-shoulder gag and the character-turns-round-and-bumps-into-someone bit? Are we really supposed to laugh knowingly at these fossilised scenes because of the movie's desperate attempts to emulate 'Scream'? Yes we are and yes we are, and screw you, movie.The kernel of a good idea is in there somewhere - a serial killer recreates urban legends - but other than that it's a creative dead zone. The clunky dialogue is spouted by a cast culled from small screen teen drivel, and the film is so idiotic that it can't even pull off a competent false scare. For instance, the killer wears a hooded parka - scary! - and in one scene one of the non-characters sees a parka-clad figure enter a swimming pool building, walk purposefully towards a swimmer and stand there menacingly... you could cut the tension with a spoon... but not to worry, it's just someone with a swimsuit under the coat and not the killer after all! Phew! But why in the name of holy hell would someone walk into a pool room on a hot day dressed in a parka?The film is littered with similarly pathetic red herrings and false accusations. Half the characters own a parka with a furry hood to put us off the scent, but the only scent is the reeking BS that permeates the entire movie. The direction is lacklustre and the editing sloppy and apathetic, resulting in a movie so poorly structured that one scene just flops into the next, with no kind of impetus or momentum. That's what really gets me about this film it's incredibly lazy, it doesn't try. The brief flashes of so-called post-modernism are there only because Kevin Williamson gave the writers of these films licence to crib from every one of their predecessors and dress it up as some kind of witty homage.So we have a bland young cast, killings-a-plenty, a few in-jokes (Joshua Jackson turns on the radio, hears the theme tune to 'Dawson's Creek' and switches it off again), an arbitrary unmasking and loads of stupid dialogue that doesn't so much advance the plot as send it plodding round in circles. As repetitive and shoddy and predictable as the original cycle of slasher movies was, at least those movies didn't maintain a smug sense of superiority while they were busy being rubbish.

Seeing as Jackson and the character are two badass mother-shut yo mouths. But the end result is disappointing.The plot revolves around Shaft, played by Jackson, seeking to take down the son of a wealthy and powerful man. The son is played by Christian Bale, and the reason Shaft is after him is because he murdered a black man out of racial hate. But he managed to escape prison time and fled to Switzerland. Shaft gets sick,of the injustice and hands in his badge, taking a vigilante approach. His only hope is finding the lone witness of the murder and convince her to take the stand.Here's the film's main problem. The actions he takes are not protected by the law. The cops are even helping him, and no consequences are paid. True, you want him to win, but you can't overlook he is breaking the law. The original Shaft was more of a lone wolf. Shaft here can't seem to do anything without help.The films villains are forgettable. As good as Bale is, he's hardly there and is out of the majority of the action. Jeffrey Wright as a Hispanic gangster emerges as the main villain and is utterly uninteresting. A great villain should make you like him, even if you hate him. I don't even remember the character's name.But I think the biggest downfall is casting Richard Roundtree in a reprisal of his original Shaft role and waste him.
