In fact, it's almost (I stress the word almost) a passable, entertaining sequel -- until the ridiculous ending. Kim Henkel, who co-wrote the original TCM returns to write & direct this remake\/sequel. Just like TCM 3, this one makes no effort to include events of the previous movie into it's story (except for a very brief mention in the introduction). Four teens get in an offroad accident after the prom and find themselves being hunted by Leatherface, and yet another horde of new family members. The movie moves at a nice speed and the plot takes many predictable turns and characters do extremely dumb things (i.e. a girl is locked in a trunk; driver pulls over at crowded fast-food area. Instead of screaming for help to the dozens of people around, she calmly pleads with her kidnapper I'll be quiet if you poke me an airhole).  Renee Zellweger stars as the mousy heroine (you know the cliche, ugly duckling until she lets her hair down and takes off her glasses) and Matthew McConaughey plays Vilmer, the handicapped leader of the family, whose intents don't appear to be of cannibalistic nature. The movie wasn't released until 1997, three years after production wrapped up -- due to the rising popularity of both of the leads at the time, and it's easy to see why the movie was held back and why a lot of people fought to stop it from being released. Sure, it serves as entertaining horror cheese, but the ending and the complete lack of gore, scares, excitement and logic completely flattens the experience. Kim Henkel should have been able to do better. The recent TCM remake is far superior and just embarrasses this farce. I only recommend this movie if you have seen the previous ones and want to say you saw them all, or if you do drugs. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 March 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  When you consider the sequels and the very loose timeline that came before this one, this movie didn't really screw things up that much.

Apocalypse Now for me wasn't just a film, it was an experience which I hold dear to my heart and always will.   It may have taken a long while for this to be made, but imagine what it would have been like if all the problems that occurred didn't happen, it wouldn't be the same film.  It was like it was meant to be a horrendous shoot to make it what it is and that is the great living film ever to be done.   If you take notice into every film Coppola has done since Apocalypse Now you see them as not bad or just good films, but he has accomplished something that is so harrowing and epic as this.  Coppola put so much into the movie based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness it was like he had no more vision left to put into his other projects.  Maybe Apocalypse Now was the film to blame for the not so good Godfather 3.  I enjoyed The Godfather 3 just as much the first two but  you could see something lacking from the third instalment that he didn't bring up like he did with the other two.  The story revolves around Captain Willard played by Martin Sheen who is an assassin travelling up a river with a small platoon to terminate a colonel who has gone insane.   That is the movie.  You live with these men for the first two hours of the film on this boat and the situations that happen throughout and then it comes to a halt when they arrive at Kurtz's camp where you finally get to see what you have imagined would look like.  I expected to just see a camp full of soldiers but you instead see a platoon of tribesmen and warriors who have no grip on reality and what is the difference between right and wrong.  The journey up the river starts off exciting with many things happening whether it would be the invasion on the beach with the crazy but commanding Kilgore or the playboy bunnies concert at the barracks.  The more it goes on the slower the plot is and the more relaxing it becomes.  The story begins to tire and so do you but not in a bad way.  It happens in a way where you just feel you know that these soldiers have travelled so far and tragedy has struck them one to many times and there is no reality in their minds anymore.Friends ask me what do I prefer, Redux or the original?  I say both as the original version of Apocalypse Now was just unspeakable of how good a film could be and when I saw Redux it was just a bonus and answered questions that I didn't have the answers to.   It is an emotional roller coaster ride of a movie and does depress you in a way.  You either come out of the film thinking `wow' or `What the hell was that'?   It scares me to think what George Lucas's version would have been like if he took the helm.  It would have been more commercialised  probably in my opinion and also under budget.  I think if Orson Welles went ahead with Heart Of Darkness then it would have been great and Coppola could have still made Apocalypse without much comparison to Welles's version as it would not have been set in the same backdrop of the Vietnam war.  But there is a part of me that is thankful for Welles not to direct Heart Of Darkness because it makes Apocalypse Now stand out more to the rest and that's what makes it so groundbreaking.   I remember seeing Redux in the cinema on release and the whole multiplex was packed and when Brando mutters the words `The Horror, The Horror, The Horror' and there are cross dissolves of Willard's painted face and the helicopters from the beginning flying In the background, the lights came on and everyone left in utter silence, and that's what makes Apocalypse Now so good even to this day, it silences everybody and doesn't make you think because there is no message here to read, just an experience of pure madness.   Even though Brando is only seen for at least a quarter of the of the picture, he is the man that steals the film under everybody's except Coppola's feet.  His ad libing of every scene is what an actor is really about.  He is without doubt the last great actor and no one apart from De Niro has been able to touch Brando for what he has achieved in his acting career.  He is not your average type an actor, he's your Jim Morrison of the movies who just doesn't seem all there but speaks words of beauty and terror through his words.   The music of The Doors is as haunting as any original movie score could ever be and comes in at the right time and Carmine Coppola just shines as more as his music did in The Godfather to bring the horror and heart of darkness to an end.   Apocalypse Now is not one of the greatest films ever made, it is the greatest film ever made and no film will probably ever surpass it, not in my lifetime anyway and if something does come along then it will have to be noting short of a miracle and let's face it you don't see many of them in Hollywood.

I was so excited seeing Titanic for the first time as it is The Gone With The Wind of our generation but with more special effects and more disaster like the Gone with the Wind was.   If you ask someone to this day what they think of titanic then you will probably get the response you might expect and that is it was rubbish or it didn't deserve the success that it got.   I think what annoyed a lot of people about Titanic was Leonardo Di Caprio because of the teen madness that surrounded the movie at the time, but that doesn't make it a bad film and it certainly doesn't make Leonardo's performance any less convincing than it was because he was top class and nothing more.   When I was going to see Gangs of new York I asked friends to come along but they didn't want to because of Di Caprio and if that is the reason why then they are without doubt narrow minded, it's not his fault that my friends girlfriends would rather sleep with him and not them but let's talk about the film.As soon as the film starts its pretty obvious how the ending is going to turn out but it's just not a story of Jack and Rose, it's about everybody that was aboard the Titanic.  These characters become more important obviously when the ship is sinking but it doesn't stop you caring and wondering about who these people were.   The scene where the young Irish mother is telling a poem to her children when they lay in their whilst the sea water over runs there deck just shows how cruel titanic was for sinking for letting that happen to people especially when there is nothing you can do about.  It reminded me of how somebody is drowning but is not actually underneath the water but is waiting to die , and I think that's what makes Titanic such an important movie about struggle and the strength to continue and fight for survival.  These are hidden messages but seem obvious once you have watched so many times like I have and James Cameron maybe a lot of things but a bad director he isn't as every film he has ever made apart from Piranha 2 have been masterpieces even True Lies can be seen as a comic action masterpiece as it has your villains, your hero's and the love interest.

In the course of the film, the audience comes to learn that Bobby is not originally from a working-class background; he comes from a well-to-do and artistic middle-class family, and he himself was once a promising concert pianist before he abandoned his career.What we never find out is exactly why Bobby gave up his life in music. While talking to his father, he says, `You know, I was never that good', but there is no indication whether this is the truth, or the result of insecurity about his talent, or an excuse he has invented. What is undoubtedly true is that Bobby is in revolt against his family, not just against their ambitions for him to excel in music, but also against their entire lifestyle. The family have a deep love of high culture in all its forms, and particularly of classical music. Bobby has abandoned not only his career in music but also his family's cultural values. His life in Texas, revolving around heavy drinking, bowling alleys, country-and-western music and casual womanising (even though he has a live-in girlfriend, Rayette), seems to have been designed to fit every middle-class stereotype about how the working-class live.The family's obsession with music is shown in the names they have given to their children; Bobby's full name is Robert Eroica Dupea, his brother is Carl Fidelio and his sister is Partita. Names, in fact, are important in this film. The central character's split identity is shown by his two names- he is still Robert to his family, and only Rayette and his Texas friends call him Bobby. Rayette's name seems to have been invented to fit her social background, it being something of a film convention that a female character with an unusual name consisting of a supposedly feminine suffix added to a male name will be drawn from the poor underclass.Rebellion against middle-class values is frequently presented in films (and in other art forms) as something laudable, but not here. This is not an ideological film that aims to attack the vices of the bourgeoisie or to extol the virtues of the proletariat, but rather a character study of a largely unsympathetic character. Bobby is selfish and irresponsible, unable to accept any restrictions on his freedom to do as he pleases or to consider the happiness of others when this conflicts with his own wishes. He retains, moreover, some of the more unattractive middle-class characteristics, especially snobbishness. A man who forces his girlfriend to stay in a motel because he is too ashamed of her social origins to let his family meet her (as Bobby does to Rayette) can hardly be said to have freed himself from middle-class values. Ironically, when Rayette does eventually meet Bobby's family, they get on much better than he had feared.There has been much discussion of the precise significance of the title `Five Easy Pieces'; my interpretation would be that, besides the obvious musical meaning, it also relates to Bobby's character. In music, he will never try a difficult piece if he can get away with playing an easier one- as he does when his sister asks him to play for her. In life too, he is always looking for the easy way out, the least amount of responsibility or the least emotional risk. The final scene, where Bobby abandons Rayette on impulse to start a new life in Alaska is perhaps the best example of this, but he also treats his family badly, as when he seduces his brother's girlfriend.Although there are some other good contributions, particularly from Karen Black as Rayette, it is Jack Nicholson's performance as Bobby that stands. Nicholson always holds the viewer's attention, whatever he is doing, and in his set pieces can make the film spark into life. The scenes where Bobby confronts a surly waitress in a diner and a snobbish friend of the family are among the best in the film, charged with a sort of angry humour. Throughout the whole of his performance, in fact, there is something that would become a Nicholson trademark- an undercurrent of suppressed anger. This combination of barely-controlled (and sometimes uncontrolled) rage and grim humour prefigures a later, and even better, Nicholson performance in `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'.`Five Easy Pieces' is not a film of the same calibre; it can be dull and static in places and, like many character studies of unsympathetic characters, it can seem lacking in heart. It is, however, worth seeing, if only for one commanding performance. 6\/10.

His life in Texas, revolving around heavy drinking, bowling alleys, country-and-western music and casual womanising (even though he has a live-in girlfriend, Rayette), seems to have been designed to fit every middle-class stereotype about how the working-class live.The family's obsession with music is shown in the names they have given to their children; Bobby's full name is Robert Eroica Dupea, his brother is Carl Fidelio and his sister is Partita. Names, in fact, are important in this film. The central character's split identity is shown by his two names- he is still Robert to his family, and only Rayette and his Texas friends call him Bobby. Rayette's name seems to have been invented to fit her social background, it being something of a film convention that a female character with an unusual name consisting of a supposedly feminine suffix added to a male name will be drawn from the poor underclass.Rebellion against middle-class values is frequently presented in films (and in other art forms) as something laudable, but not here. This is not an ideological film that aims to attack the vices of the bourgeoisie or to extol the virtues of the proletariat, but rather a character study of a largely unsympathetic character. Bobby is selfish and irresponsible, unable to accept any restrictions on his freedom to do as he pleases or to consider the happiness of others when this conflicts with his own wishes. He retains, moreover, some of the more unattractive middle-class characteristics, especially snobbishness. A man who forces his girlfriend to stay in a motel because he is too ashamed of her social origins to let his family meet her (as Bobby does to Rayette) can hardly be said to have freed himself from middle-class values. Ironically, when Rayette does eventually meet Bobby's family, they get on much better than he had feared.There has been much discussion of the precise significance of the title `Five Easy Pieces'; my interpretation would be that, besides the obvious musical meaning, it also relates to Bobby's character. In music, he will never try a difficult piece if he can get away with playing an easier one- as he does when his sister asks him to play for her. In life too, he is always looking for the easy way out, the least amount of responsibility or the least emotional risk. The final scene, where Bobby abandons Rayette on impulse to start a new life in Alaska is perhaps the best example of this, but he also treats his family badly, as when he seduces his brother's girlfriend.Although there are some other good contributions, particularly from Karen Black as Rayette, it is Jack Nicholson's performance as Bobby that stands. Nicholson always holds the viewer's attention, whatever he is doing, and in his set pieces can make the film spark into life. The scenes where Bobby confronts a surly waitress in a diner and a snobbish friend of the family are among the best in the film, charged with a sort of angry humour. Throughout the whole of his performance, in fact, there is something that would become a Nicholson trademark- an undercurrent of suppressed anger. This combination of barely-controlled (and sometimes uncontrolled) rage and grim humour prefigures a later, and even better, Nicholson performance in `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'.`Five Easy Pieces' is not a film of the same calibre; it can be dull and static in places and, like many character studies of unsympathetic characters, it can seem lacking in heart. It is, however, worth seeing, if only for one commanding performance. 6\/10.

The status of women, blacks, gays, college students, and draftees is being questioned and examined.  But the unrest doesn't seem to have invaded the lives of the characters portrayed by Katherine Houghton and Sidney Poitier. She's a carefree early-twentysomething whose debut bow was probably the most strenuous moment of her life, and he's a widowed doctor in his late thirties who has risen above his humble beginnings (as the son of a mail carrier and, I presume, a housewife) to become internationally renowned.  Oh, yeah, and she's white and he's black.  And they met ten days ago in Hawaii.  Oh, and they want to get married.  Like, now.  Is that okay, Mom and Dad?Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy (in his last film role) portray Houghton's parents.  Daddy's a newspaper publisher, and Mom toys around with the arts ... oh, piffle, she owns a gallery, nothing serious.  Just pin money.  They live in a mansion in the San Francisco gentry ghetto and are lovingly cared for by Tillie (Mrs. Jefferson didn't take no lip even back then) and Dorothy, the mod young thang in the psychedelic minidress.  They are fashionably agnostic, although they cultivate the friendship of an affable old priest, and up until now, their laissez-faire outlook on social justice has never really been put to the test, as their priest pal observes with not inconsiderable amusement.Roy Glenn and Beah Richards portray Poitier's parents.  Pop's not too keen on the impending nuptials, and says as much in no uncertain terms, prompting Poitier to blithely retort that Pop's many sacrifices in raising his son to have a better life than he himself did were no more than his (Poitier's) due.  That one scene put a bit of a tarnish on Dr. Perfecto for me, although he had also annoyed me thoroughly throughout the movie by pronouncing his ladylove's name as Joanner.  How veddy veddy blueblooded of him.Anyhoo, this was Hollywood's take on the miscegenation issue in the turbulent late sixties, and since we know they had to be CAREFUL, it's not too surprising the way this story went.  Everyone spent a lot of time baring their souls, climaxing with Beah Richards (the best part of the movie in my opinion) calmly asserting to Spencer Tracy that he must have forgotten what it's like to be in love, or he wouldn't be so worried about racial disparity.  True enough, but in his place, I daresay I'd have worried about ANY daughter of mine wanting to marry someone after knowing him only ten days.  But I digress.I see from reading other comments that Spencer Tracy had to jump through quite a few hoops to even get to be in this film at all, and so I assume he was pleased with the way it turned out at the end -- he gets to make everyone shut up and listen to his long, blustery speech on his feelings about the whole situation and how he's decided that, doubts be damned, the happy couple should be given the blessings of all and let's all fly to Switzerland to see them married.  Neatly tying up the film (except for a few teary shots of Katharine Hepburn, meant to bronze forever this final screen pairing of the long-term illicit lovers) and steamrollering over any other objections, then, everyone troops in to dinner.  The benevolent Caucasian patriarch has spoken, and that's that.Others have commented upon the overall weirdness of certain scenes --  the one of Dorothy dancing with the delivery boy, the visit to the drive in for ice cream, and Katharine Hepburn's dressing down and firing of Virginia Christine (poor Mrs. Oleson!).  I have to agree that these scenes tend to stop the film cold and leave you wondering why they were included at all. Virginia Christine's appearance at the beginning of the movie made more than clear what her opinion about Poitier's and Houghton's even keeping company together, much less marrying, was.  To bring her back as the great WASP avenger of young white feminine purity was a bit much.So much more could have been done with this film, and it's rather sad in retrospect.  The time when it could have been made effectively is gone forever, which is good for the most part.  People take interracial marriages for granted today.  That is as it should be.  And I'm sure that this movie had at least a small part in influencing the change in thought and perspective.  But it could still have done so much more.

Don't worry, this horror film isn't discriminatory when it comes to its victims, the guys get it just as bad too. Her boyfriend gets his head sliced off with a wire!Cut to the present, we are introduced to our maniac, wonderfully played by Joe Spinell, waking up from a bad nightmare (or was it?), who shares his bed with a mannequin wearing a bloody scalp. Turns out our hero is nothing more than a big momma's boy who only wants to have her close to him after she kicked the bucket in a car accident a few years earlier.This is supposed to be the explanation as to why this guy goes out scalping women and stapling them to mannequins.But that isn't the reason why anyone would care to watch this movie. The REAL reason is to watch this psycho serial-killer stalking the streets of New York City at night, preying on hapless female victims who end up getting themselves in ridiculous situations with comedic timing.The first female victim is a prostitute who is choked to death. But the comedy begins with the second murder where a cheating whore and her boyfriend leave a bar and sneak off to a secluded area for a bit of slap and tickle in their parked car.You will be surprised to see Tom Savini (everyone's favorite go-to guy when it comes to over-the-top special effects and grisly make-up in 70's and 80's horror movies) making a cameo as the boyfriend (and I'm pretty sure he had something to do with his own death scene!).Our maniac shows up with a shotgun and blows ol' Tom's head off in a scene that brings back fond memories of SCANNERS, before giving his girlfriend the same treatment. Unfortunately, we don't get to see her gratuitous head exploding shot.The funniest scene involves the next victim, a nurse who gets chased by our maniac into a deserted subway. She locks herself in a toilet cubicle where she makes the most funniest faces I have EVER seen in a movie (Jim Carrey, you have met your match) as she tries to hold her breath so our maniac won't hear her. Unfortunately, the comedy comes to an abrupt end as she gets it through the chest with a dagger.There are a few more murders and a laughable subplot involving some female photographer of whom he becomes interested in. But you may as well fast forward to the end where our maniac discovers all of his mannequins (with scalps attached) coming to life where you will have the biggest laugh of your life! They all look like zombified versions of the women he butchered, seeking revenge on him in the same way they themselves were murdered.One woman's head falls off (LOL) and blood spurts out of the bloody stump like some sort of CREEPSHOW ploy to our maniac's horror, while the rest of the women struggle to remove his head from his body in a side-splitting scene that has to be seen to be believed.The ending is reminiscent to that of the ultimate trash classic PIECES, although that movie came out a few years after this one. This film bundles all the cheap elements of 80's horror trash, such as stupid female characters who scream to get killed, bumbling police detectives, hilarious dialogue and the usual round-up of male scumbag characters who add their support to the thin plot.I seriously recommend this movie if you're looking for a good laugh or two.

I wouldn't recommend buying the soundtrack as it only has half of the songs on the film.   I believe that this is Scorsese's masterpiece bar none and does it with such elegance and style that it will be hard for any director to try and touch this film in the coming future as the only film which I think isn't far behind Goodfellas is Scorsese's other gangster masterpiece, the overlooked Casino.What excites me to this day and will do for generations is the way Scorsese uses music to his scenes and let's face it, he is a mastermind with his music choice as it is so different.  The idea to start the film with Tony Bennett's Rags to Riches which is perfect as it fit's Henry Hill's life from something to nothing and don't get me started on the scene where lot's of gangsters wind up dead in many places with the beauty of Derrick and the Domino's Layla in the background just works on so many levels.But the story alone is just fascinating to see how a character like Henry started his life as a somebody and for it to end in Henry Hill's remaining last words `an average nobody'.   I can't remember which film it was that was up against Goodfellas at the Oscars, I think it was Dances With Wolves but how do you watch a film like Goodfellas and then lose out to a director Oscar To Dances With Wolves.  Don't get me wrong I love Dances With Wolves but Goodfellas is every director dream of a true gangster biopic.  Let's face it, the only Oscar Scorsese is ever going to see is probably a Life Time Achievement award and he will probably be dead if they were going to give it to him but I maybe wrong with The Aviator Coming up.Ray Liotta out does himself with Goodfellas and he is still not as known as an actor as he should be, by just watching this and other films like Copland and Narc you know he is just a dynamite actor who doesn't star in so many films.   Robert De Niro is on top form as is Joe Pesci and Paul Sorvino but the one thing that stands out most in this film is the editing by the great Thelma Scoonmaker.  Her quick cuts in between scenes is what makes Goodfellas such an outstanding achievement and the same goes for the cinematography.  Just look at the scene where Henry takes Karen to a posh club and the camera starts rolling from outside when they both get out of the car and they go through the back way going passed many people and going through the kitchens and backstage area without the camera cutting is just a stroke of genius and he does the same in Raging Bull and Gangs of New York and this is what I admire a lot and most in Scorsese Films, the way he just turns a simple scene into something so outstanding it makes the film more original.  I am a film student and I have tried to do these shots without any shake and continuity and it's quite hard and very challenging to get it just right so when watching Goodfellas it just stands out in my mind and always will which is what makes Goodfellas so special as it contains some of the best Acting, Directing, Editing, Cinematography and Musical Soundtrack I have ever seen.

I can't think of any other film where all these characters are so real to the human eye.  That's where Eastwood tricks you into believing all the characteristics of his characters in films like this and Mystic River.  I read on IMDB that it was Costner who convinced Eastwood to take the role of the Marshall in this film which made me watch this dark masterpiece.   Kevin Costner is an outlaw on the run from the police after escaping from prison with a fellow inmate who is as menacing as the next criminal and on the way they get involved with a family and it all goes wrong and they take the young boy of the family Phillip hostage.   That is where the story begins and from there it is a cat and mouse story with a relaxed feeling to it.  Eastwood does an excellent job letting the audience delve into the characters minds of their pass and present.   What makes me love this film is how Eastwood turns Butch played by Costner into this lovable character who has a kind heart but he doesn't let you forget who is really is and that's a criminal.  The scene where Butch and Phillip take refuge into the black man's house and Butch notices the black man beating his son and decides enough is enough and inflicts some of his own psychology pain is just a great moment in the film where the true colours of who Butch really unfolds.  It isn't all serious either as Eastwood's character is very funny from time to time even right at the end he is still being clumsy when trying to talk to Butch through megaphone and is getting back sound.
