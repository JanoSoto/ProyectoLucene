She is mystified as to why her husband would have really commissioned a snuff film, although the point of knowing this after he is deceased seems a slight mystery.Cage is very good, and Catherine Keener is his wife, who is not given a significant role, but is good enough. Peter Stormare also could have been given a meatier role, his character was more interesting than Gandolfini.The visuals seem similar to Se7en in that we see the seamier side of life, one scene where the nun hands Cage the victim's suitcase and asks him to give it back to her family is especially touching. There are also a few subliminal references to religion; the wealthy widow's name is Christian, she lives in a compound, isolated from the world, but not protected from the harsh reality of her husband's perversion.

Not this version, not the 1932 and also most certainly not the 2001 version, for obvious reasons. It's the reason why mummy movies aren't that well known as other genre movies as for instance Frankenstein and vampire movies. This Hammer take on the mummy story is no exception. It's a well made movie but overall a too simple one, that lacks suspense, mystery or even a good main plot line.Like all Hammer movies, this movie is perfectly entertaining and watchable but fails to make a big lasting impression. It's a movie that has its moments, which helps to make sure that this movie is an above average one and because of that an also perfectly watchable one.Real problem I had with this movie was its simple story. Basically this is the main plot line of this movie is the mummy and Mehemet Bey taking revenge on those who opened the grave of the mummy's 4000 year old lover Princess Ananka. This is basically all that happens in this movie. The story is filled with some missed opportunities and bad executed moments. The character of Isobel Banning is completely underused in the movie and they could had used her character to make the movie more interesting and provide it with some more depth, with her relation between John Banning and the mummy. Her character now instead pops up every now and then, without even properly introducing her into the story. With a better story this movie would had definitely been a better one.Still the movie still has plenty enough to offer. All of the scene's with the mummy are a delight. This is mainly thanks to the fact that he is being played by Christopher Lee. He has the perfect body type to play the character. It also is thanks to the convincing and great looking make-up effects. Another great sequences is the gentleman stand-off between John Banning (Peter Cushing) and Mehemet Bey (George Pastell), in which both try to lure each other out, without revealing their true identity and motivations in words. It reminded me of the sequences between Bela Lugosi and Edward Van Sloan in the 1931 Dracula movie.It's thanks to Peter Cushing's acting that this movie doesn't descent to a lower level of cinema. I admit that this is one of his best roles, in terms of his acting. Like I said before, Christoper Lee is also perfectly cast but the rest of the cast is rather disappointing, especially Eddie Byrne as Inspector Mulrooney.The movie is rather good looking and does its very best to build up a suitable atmosphere.

It stars Samuel L Jackson as a small town doctor with a wandering eye. The story is told from the viewpoint of his middle child, Eve, wonderfully played by Jurnee Smollett, who sees her middle-class family life threatened by her father's infidelities.No tale set in a bayou village could exist without references to black magic and voodoo, and this film also has them as a rather central part of the plot. But these elements are handled skilfully and believably, and heighten the tension that develops.One of the interesting tools used by Lemmons is to tell and retell a story from different characters' perspectives, asking the viewer to determine which is more truthful, and indeed, whether the truth is paramount.Jackson gives a sparkling performance as Dr Louis Batiste, a man of warmth and generosity who is well regarded by the local community that he serves. His family is seemingly a happy and close one, until the children begin to question some of the adult behaviour they witness.Jurnee Smollett's Eve is the main protagonist around whom much of the story is centred, and she effortlessly moves back and forth between being a precocious brat and a young woman with powerful emotions. The rest of the cast is also very good, including a voluptuous Lisa Nicole Carson as the temptress Mattie Mereaux, and Diahann Carroll as a bayou witch.This film moves along at a good pace and is a little more than you might expect.

Like I said, the movie is just wonderful and fascinating. It gives the audience that tickling feeling in the stomach every time one watches it, or at least, every time I did. I'm not Italian or speak Italian so I had to depend solely on the subtitles while viewing this film. I personally viewed the movie at least 5 times. I watched it at least 3 times with normal speed and at lest 2 more times with FF( it feels different).The main reason for watching it 5 times was because of the confusion that I had while watching the film. The first time that I watched the movie, I, to be frank, did not understand almost anything. I didn't know who this main character Guido was suppose to be and was confused with all those women who he kept on referring to. I was lost in the movie. So, I went back the second and third time and began to find something new every time. It was at my third view that I actually understood the movie. Now, people may say that I'm just slow, but this movie is actually quiet complicated and takes time to digest it. There are just so many metaphoric symbols and hidden meaning in the movie. The white background and cloth, the dialogues that represent some kind of deep meaning, and every action that characters make, just make the movie so interesting. The characters themselves are quiet complicated with their tangled relationships and internal struggles. The movie is in Guido's view and describes all his struggles and confusions that he has about life and his job. Every time Guido observes something, the film is transferred to his past. If not the past, he drowns in his own imagination where he is loved by everyone and is praised like a King. The notion that I got from these imaginations was that the main character believes that everyone should love him. The scene where Guido is in the house(where he spent his childhood) with all the women that he ever knew in life shows that well. Here, the sister-in-law, who actually hates Guido, comes out as one of Guido's fan in his imagination. The reality, on the contrary, is different and everybody is starting to doubt and question Guido. Thus, these transitions from reality to fantasy describe the confusion and hopelessness that the character has.Music also serves as a good way to express the emotions of the characters. There is the main theme song, bright and childish, which expresses the childishness or the will of the main character to go back to his childhood. Other times, different sounds are used to express the emotions of different characters. One of the sounds that jumped out at me was the sound that was played in the scene where Guido and his companions went to see the under-construction spaceship for the new movie. It was just so different from the rest of the movie.The movie is actually quiet addictive once one gets to understand the movie. I watched the movie two or three more times just because I liked it. I know what's going to happen and what the story is about, but the movie will just draw you in. It's a great movie and I recommend it to everyone who loves movie as an art-form.
