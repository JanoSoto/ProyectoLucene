This is Sandler's sixth starring role feature, and it seems that the sixth time is a splending charm.  This is Sandler's best work yet! Now in case you are wondering, I enjoyed both HAPPY GILMORE, and THE WEDDING SINGER.  But there's something charming and wonderful on why I enjoyed BIG DADDY more.  Perhaps it's seeing a over-grown kid taking care of a little boy.  Or it's Sandler mixing his in your face attitude that he gave in HAPPY GILMORE with his soft-spot attiude from THE WEDDING SINGER.  Whatever it is, it works, and it works very well! The simple plot of BIG DADDY is a 5 year old child is left on the doorstep of Sandler's apartment.  It turns out to be the child of his roommate (Jon Stewart), who's on his way to China for a legal case.  So what is Sandler to do, but to give him to the child protective service.  But it's a holiday, and they are closed, so Sandler keeps him for a day, then another day, and... well you get the picture. But the plot doesn't matter much with this film, it's the laughs, and you do get plenty of those.  But you also get a wonderful supporting cast. There's a good support from Jon Stewart, the always wonderful and beautiful Joey Lauren Adams, Leslie Mann, and Kristy Swanson (the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer). And what's a Sandler movie like if you don't have his usual character actor friends in small comic roles; Rob Schrieder, Steve Buscemi, Josh Mostel, Allen Covert (the caddy from HAPPY GILMORE who was also the limo driver friend in THE WEDDING SINGER), and Jonathan Loughran (the lazy-eyed football player in THE WATERBOY).  There's even a funny cameo role by director Dennis Dugan, as the man who refuses to answer the door on Halloween, while Sandler is taking his adopted son trick or treating. This film was a lot more funnier that THE WATERBOY, it was also funnier than THE WEDDING SINGER and HAPPY GILMORE.  It was believe it or not, more touching.  You can understand why Sandler doesn't want to let this boy go, since he reminds him so much of himself.  And Sandler sees that being a father figure isn't only fun, but it redeems himself from the lost of his girlfriend. I have to give both Sandler and director Dennis Dugan (the same director of HAPPY GILMORE) a round of applause.  They teamed up for a comedy that is not only successful, but will make A LOT of money. Sandler and Dugan are the best comedian\/director team since the late John Belushi and John Landis.  I'm just hoping that they will continue to do films together in the futrue.

A simple agrarian society would have kept things a lot quieter for it ..Where is the appeal of The Matrix? It's not a particularly clever film in terms of plot, and treads the line very close between epic tradition and lazy no-brainer, mostly landing well into the latter. The strength is in the sheer quantity of references that comprise in to the web of visual and stylistic elements, and that they are not drawn in simply to fill space, but with affection and awareness. The plot pivots on the premise, familiar to eastern (and to some extent western) philosophical traditions, that the world we know is an illusion, and that only awareness of that can enable us to transcend it. This high concept is then pushed into the mindworld occupied by cults and the paranoid - the illusion is deliberately maintained by malevolent intelligence outside our awareness, except when revealed to the initiate by the the informed, or accidentally discovered by the innocent. The former happens here.

Going under during a party, Bacon comes back haunted by feelings that a murder has occurred near him recently.  His son has the same visions and the two try to discover what happened to a neighborhood girl who disappeared years before. I understand very easily what director David Koepp is trying to do with this thriller.  Mixing equal parts Exorcist, domestic drama, and TBS original movie ham, Koepp strains to keep this mess afloat.  It's an uphill battle, but Echoes is actually quite effective in it's initial moments.  Koepp is a very seasoned screenwriter (Jurassic Park, Mission Impossible), so the man knows a thing or two about pleasing an audience. When the Bacon character begins the journey into the unknown, the film is packed to the seams with spooky atmosphere and ambitious storytelling. It's very winning to see a movie that's actually trying to creep the audience out (a proven point due to the high level of What the hell... comments during the screening I attended). It's a majestic first half, and one that sets the film up for greatness. When the action turns to Bacon and the strain his madness puts on his marriage, it's there that the film unravels completely.  What was once a creepy and effective thriller now has become a interminable bore.  The resolution of the film, involving a slow rape sequence, is sickening on two levels.  First being that simple fact that Koepp sinks to a new low by showing us the rape - very tasteful, isn't it?  The second being that the movie uses General Hospital type theatrics to get out of, what I thought was, a very complex plot .  It ends silly.  Getting there is even worse.  Koepp had something going but loses it in the closure, what accounts for this I will never know.  Based on a book, Echoes falls apart very cinematically, not like a book would.  It seems like a studio wouldn't let Koepp have his way with the entire movie. Kevin Bacon gets all the credit in the world with his acting.  He usually can be relied on to show us very different characters in each movie he does. It's a talent that many do not even try to discover. In Echoes, not much is asked of Bacon. And he returns the favor with one of his most forgettable performances.  Kathryn Erbe portrays Bacon's wife and she fares better, but in the end her character never really mattered.  Bad character actors like Kevin Dunn and Illeana Douglas round out the cast. Not the best group of performers, but this was not the best script. You decide who's at fault. Stir Of Echoes is a very forgettable thriller.  A movie that might work for people who see 2 films a year. It's always shocking to see a film break apart like this. Koepp's last film Trigger Effect was a more carefully structured movie that was far more successful with half the dramatic raw materials.  I hope Koepp can bounce back from this.  He obviously can craft a crowdpleasing film, just not one so aggressive in it's intent to please.----------- 4  ","genre":null},{"date":"25 June 1999","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Kevin Bacon stars as a man who is very skeptical to the real powers of hypnotism.

However, I cannot deny that I turned out being a tad disappointed. Keaton stars as a tough journalist working at a tabloid newspaper, fighting between his job and his personal life with wife Tomei, who just happens to be expecting. Close plays the chief editor at the paper, a tough executive who demands things on time. Duvall is the senior editor at the office who has a crappy personal life and a prostate problem (How ingenious!). The film circles around a day in the life of these involved characters, and eventually what happens when they face a deadline and have to decide what news is fit to print and what is morally right to report. I didn't get too lost through this film, but I was bothered about how the issues in the plot are never properly articulated. I couldn't grasp why their issues were so cutting and affecting to the New York population. I appreciated the way that Ron Howard portrayed the bustling atmosphere behind the scenes of journalism, but why couldn't he catch his breath and particularly indicate what it was that we should be looking for? Outside of Keaton's homelife, the other's lives seem to be just passing fancies, excerpts that seem important but end too quickly before they can take on any meaning. A fine cast is used fairly well, and a certain amount of realism is depicted, but this is all in all supposed to be a movie, and not necessarily a docudrama.

Private Witt ponders Maybe everyone's got one big soul that everybody's a part of...The people who say that The Thin Red Line is boring, that it's a war film with no action, need to stick to Armageddon.  There's plenty of intense action in this movie, believe me.  It may not shove it in your face the way that Saving Private Ryan did, but like I said, it's still intense. Saving Private Ryan is a great film, one of 1998's best.  The Thin Red Line, in my opinion is better.  The battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan made my mouth hang open with horror.  I never really knew that it was that bad at D-Day, until, of course, I saw the movie.  The Thin Red Line contained supensful battles that caused me to hold on tight to my seat, not letting go.  They are equally horrific, but in different ways.There is a great beauty to the first 15 minutes that I think a lot of people missed.  The section has some of the greatest images in cinema.  The islanders, swimming in the blue, crystal waters of the Pacific is one of the most tranquil, serene shots ever filmed.  The lush, green island trees as Private Witt walks through the native village.  This is heaven, and Terrence Malick makes it feel that way.Around 390 miles worth of film was shot during the making of The Thin Red Line.  The original director's cut was 6 hours.  Malick had to chop it down to less than 3 hours, and he still made a great film.  I didn't find the voice-overs annoying in the slightest bit.The Thin Red Line never lost my attention.  I didn't think it became boring after the battle.  I became interested in the different characters' outcomes. (Despite the not-too-much character development).  Private Bell's outcome hit me hard, I didn't even see it coming.I did find the cameos by John Travolta and George Clooney a bit distracting, but since Malick had to edit it down, this suggests that both Clooney and Travolta were in it substantially longer.  How I hope they let Malick come out with a director's cut!What question does this film ask?  The late Gene Siskel said it best. What is the source of the underbelly of hate that fuels war.  A question for the ages in a film for the ages. ","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"25 June 1999","score":"","review":"  A fun trip, baby.

I know he faced death many times but I don't know how many times or any of the details of his ordeal in WWII.  He wouldn't ever talk about them, not even to my mother or her sister.  Sometimes I could never understand that, but now I do.  If this is really what it was like to be a soldier, no matter what war you are fighting, then it must be an incredibly difficult ordeal to drudge up memories that are this disturbing, this vivid and this real.  I have never been to war and I hope to God that I never have to experience war, but after seeing this movie I believe I can tell you at least what it may have been like.  This movie is that vivid and that honest.The first half an hour of this film is some of the most amazing direction I have seen in any film in my entire life.  I have even read that Spielberg toned it down some.  That is hard to believe knowing what is up there on screen.This film is brilliant in every capacity.  The direction is so clear and crisp that you feel like you know these men when the film is over.  You feel like you understand the war a little better than you did before.  The acting is terrific.  And not just Hanks and Damon, but everyone from Sizemore to Ribisi to the grunt that gets his guts blown out ( take your pick as to who that is. )I can't believe a film like Shakespeare in Love, a film that could have been an after school special, was chosen as best picture.  Best picture?  Over this?  How is that possible?  If you haven't seen this ( and there aren't many of you out there ) please do yourself a favour, see it tonight.  It is such an amazing film and it is one that I will never forget.A final note  Even though my grandfather has been gone for about 8 years now, I salute him and every other guy that put it on the line and did so because they believed in what they were doing.  I have a new understanding and appreciation for people like my grandfather.  And that a film could make me feel that way is something special in itself.
