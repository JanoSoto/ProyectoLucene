While dealing with his business problems he advises his youngest daughter Susan that she must find true love.  She meets a young man in a coffee shop and falls for his charms but leaves without him.  When the young man is hit by a bus and killed, Death decides to use his body to visit earth.  He postpones the death of Parrish in return for experiencing life.  However his influence causes an impact on Parrish's business and on his daughter.This is a rework of 1934's `Death Takes a Holiday' - four writers worked tirelessly to take that short charmer and spin it into a ponderous three hour slog.  The story is simple enough - Death comes to earth, falls in love, makes friends, is a fish out of water but must eventually go back' - however it's seriously stretched and delivered in very slow chunks.  The various strands (the business confrontation, the romance etc) don't sit well together and it's like the writers all took turns rather than working together.  At the start it is quite charming, but the longer it goes on, the less you care and the less charming it becomes.Why did it have to be so long?  There are so many elements of the story that could have been trimmed down.  So many scenes could have been told in a shorter time or removed totally.  It feels like nothing they shot ended up on the cutting room floor.  For example, Pitt shares several scenes (total about 10 minutes) with an elderly Jamaican woman, these scenes don't add anything to the film more than that they are terrible - Pitt does a horrible, horrible patwa accent.  Surely the editor should have removed these on quality alone!If this had been good then it wouldn't matter if it was so long - but there's only enough to last for 2 hours at most.  That's 60 minutes worth of filler that could have been lost.  The performances are mixed, but are mainly as heavy and unwieldy as the film itself.  Pitt starts well - his &#145;human' role is really charming and I thought that he was already Death and thought he'd be that way for the whole film.  However when he becomes death he is totally flat and lifeless - obviously that's how Death would be, but it makes him really dull and wastes the charm that has made him a star.  His Jamaican accent is absolutely terrible and just shows he has no judgement.  Forlani holds her own well beside an experienced cast but the romance between her and death is unbelievable due to Pitt's stony performance.  Hopkins is good throughout and shows Pitt up to be a star rather than an actor.  The support is mostly good - but that old Jamaican lady has got to go!The film is far too long - at one point I thought it was winding up and that the end must be 10 minutes away - it was winding up (and did what I thought it would) but instead of 10 minutes it took 45!  Such luxurious running times should only be permitted to films that can sustain them.Overall this could have been a charming little film.  Instead it buries that charm in a three hour running time that it can't sustain.  I liked it but I wished it would end after the first 120 minutes.  Somewhere out there - it is still going!

The storyline is actually based on a true story of the life of Director Cameron Crowe, who claims it all happened.It was a good idea, because the film worked out so well especially since he Directed & Wrote it. The cast of this film were fantastic, especially by the lovely Kate Hudson, she performed miracles in this film, despite Williams (PATRICK FUGIT) character having an extremely annoying voice, it was still easy to flow on with the film. Although very likeable, the characters weren't discovered deep enough, the film was long anough, yet character development was a minor aspect of the film....Still it was very enjoying because of the realism of the characters, the great music, the feel good moments, the awfully realistic stereotypical characters, it's all in this film. The script was well written, and me also being a writer, the film only encouraged me to persue my career because i am only 18 years old. To me Almost famous lives up to its name, it is the BEST ROCK AND ROLL movie i have ever seen.Also the Cinematography in the film was fantastic, great camerawork, especially as the bus travels through the numerous scenery, not to mention the sets were really cool also.Although not a movie to continually watch, the 1st and 2nd viewing of the film are the most enjoying, sometimes you find yourself laughing,crying, and shouting with the characters. If i was asked which film was more realistically set in the 70's (Between ALMOST FAMOUS & BOOGEY NIGHTS) i would say Boogey Nights wins the award for that compartment, although well done, there were some floors in the film, sometimes you would feel the characters have gone through a time warp, thank goodness for subtitles.ACTING The acting was WAY above average, everyone played their roles right, i especially adored Kate Hudsons performance, the band members were pretty good also, Patrick Fugit was okay, yet his voice was a problem, he sounded different during the first and second half of the films because his voice cracked, i especially found him annoying second half around.ACTORS Actors were great, there were many famous faces in the film, also many familiar faces, that played their parts very well. The casting was great in the film, certainly a bunch of professionals.SCRIPT Very good, although a little more work and detail could have been placed on paper, in film they still managed to make most of the script, there were alot of well thought scenes, there wasn't really anything pointless in the movie.CINEMA Fantastic, especially during the tours with the bus, the scenery and sun sets were fantastic, i loved the park scene with PATRICK FUGIT & KATE HUDSON near the end, also the final few seconds of the film did justice for great cinematography.DRAMA The film is inbetween a Drama and a comedy, i like this style of Genre, although it sounds itneresting on its own, Almost famous places you well into the characters shoes, there is so much emotion in the film its hard to catch up, and i enjoy this, the film was Dramatic when it was meant to be a drama, and it was funny when it was meant to be a comedy.MUSIC\/FX The music was great, i liked Silverwaters performance, great soundtrack also, one of the best of 2000, a great job with the music, which set up the films atmosphere perfectally.OVERALL When it comes down to the crunch, there will be alot of people disappointed with Almost Famous, i am an exclusion, personally this film was a delight to watch in all aspects, with flawless acting, great music and true essence of Rock & Roll, not one person can object to the cool Aura of this film, and its characters.**** STARS (Out of *****)  ","genre":null},{"date":"4 February 2002","score":"","review":"  Almost Famous to say the least was a great movie.

Well-acted by Crowe, Jennifer Connelly (as his wife), Ed Harris (as a government agent) and Paul Bettany (as a college roommate) but dull dull dull!!!  It's needleslly long (over 2 hours), very slow and I had a hard time staying awake.  A few people walked out after about an hour--I wish I had joined them.  This movie purports to be a true story.  It isn't.  They make Nash into a saint-like character.  In real life he cheated on his wife (with women AND men), was addicted to drugs and divorced her.  All this is left out of the movie to make him more acceptable for mainstream audiences.  Basically though, they're lying.  They end up making his character boring.  Only Crowe's acting gives his character any depth.

I'm still waffling on that point, because The Abyss has had the hold on that claim for a long time.If you haven't read the trilogy, stop here.First off, the translation from book to movie. I'm holding off judgment on some of the changes, because they won't become important for another year or two (note to Peter Jackson releasing the movies over the course of three years is nothing short of abject cruelty!). (And if I'm using exclamation points a lot, believe me it's with good reason.)The only changes I would like to register a complaint about are two things which, I think, take away from one of the main aspects of the story... the way the Hobbits come out of nowhere to surprise everyone with their strength of character and will. Complaint number one is the way Sam, Merry and Pippin fall into the quest by accident. In the books they knew what was going on, if not the full extent of the danger, and made the decision that Frodo would not go it alone. Sam especially. The second change is the bosom-clutching scene with Arwen. The whole point of Frodo's getting stabbed, in the end, was that he survived a wound that would have overcome most men. The movie paid lip service to this, but it was still Arwen in the end, with her Take whatever grace has been granted to me and let it pass to him, that saves the day. It just doesn't sit right with me. I hope the rest of the Hobbits' heroism doesn't suffer the same fate.That's it for complaints... out of three hours of movie I have two complaints. That's how well Peter Jackson, et all, have done here. I can't claim to be a lifelong fan of the trilogy, having made only moderate progress through until I was forced to finish by the impending movie release, but that does mean everything was very fresh in my mind. A caveat I've talked to other people, who have a much longer history with the trilogy than I, and they're less forgiving of the changes. But to me, most everything (except the two points above) made sense. There's only so much you can do with a book that is as in-depth and detailed as Tolkien's work. Otherwise, you either have to make a six-part series or three six-hour movies. Try sitting through that!I think my biggest compliment to this movie is the cast. I'd read enough before the movies were made to be able to match the actors to the characters before I found out which was which. Ian McKellan is perfection as Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen is great as a scruffy Strider, and if you know what to look for you can see the King he becomes underneath. Sean Bean is exactly what I pictured as Boromir. The special effects are right where they belong... in support of the story. I've seen too many movies where the cast was there only to stare in wonder at the miracle of computer animation. Not so, here. There are a very few places where the CGI look as fake as they are, but only a few. The blend of CGI and live action is flawless in conception; the effects are part of the story and not the whole story. Fun but stupid will never apply to this movie.A final note to anyone who hasn't read the books This isn't just a trilogy, it's a triptych. Unlike Star Wars or Indiana Jones, these movies aren't a complete entity in themselves. The first two times I saw the movie, at the end someone in the audience commented on the lack of ending.

For this reason, the movie seems to jump from one chase scene to another, or from one battle scene to another, without much else taking place.This is a very violent movie, and I'm surprised it only earned a PG-13 rating in the USA's rating system.  Though those scenes were all part of the book, after 2 hours, many in the audience had already seen enough battle scenes.  Though the epic battle scenes are an integral part of Tolkien's original work, I think the movie misses an outstanding opportunity to expand the movie into the symbolic representations of good vs. evil that Tolkien originally intended.  Instead, non-Tolkien fans are left feeling a bit empty, having missed out on the major point of the movie simply because the battle scenes overpower the story.Personally, I hoped to see more of the internal conflicts between good vs. evil.  Almost every character in the movie falls under the ring's spell. Why is it that Frodo, a simple Hobbit, can withstand the ring's power and continue on his quest to destroy the ring?  Though the movie's tagline hints at the power contained in the smallest of things, it doesn't do very well at what could potentially be an even larger part of the story than just a few powerful warriors standing up against an entire army of creatures, genetically engineered for battle.  Not even Gandalf the wizard dares to handle the ring for fear it may contaminate him and that he might fall victim under its spell.  What makes Frodo so powerful that he can resist the temptation to use the ring for evil purposes?Much has been said about the movie's special effects and their realism. Though impressive at times, many of the effects are transparent.  In several scenes, I could not help but think that this was created on someone's computer.  The movie is much better in its computerized effects than most movies have been, but at the same time, it is often easy to see the boundary between reality and computer.Which brings me to another point.  When creating this movie, the producers went to great lengths to try to make Frodo look like a small Hobbit.  In some scenes, the Hobbits appear to be 3 feet tall, and yet in others, they appear to be just as tall as everyone else.  The main reason for this is because the producers did a very poor job with keeping consistent with the perspective.  For example, when a regular-sized character hands a Hobbit a sword, it should look like a long dagger in the hands of the human, but much larger in the hands of a Hobbit.  The movie did not do this very well.This would have been very easy to overlook when producing the movie since it is not something any of us think about on a daily basis.  In the real world, objects don't change size depending on the height of the person using them. However, because the film often changes perspective as a trick to make the Hobbits look smaller, the objects, surroundings and props used in the film should have looked bigger compared to the Hobbits to give the movie a greater sense of realism.In short, you will like this movie if you like Tolkien, or if you like violent and\/or frightening movies.  If you do not, skip it.

His misanthropy is very much like my own. You stare at everyone, and they all seem to fit into a specific slot so entirely well. The concept of individuality seems like a joke. How about the guy with the nunchucks? A character who should have seemed like a gross cartoon, hell, can anyone honestly say they haven't seen people just like him? You think you're the only person who differs at all from all the others. Do you hear the kind of crappy music they listen to? The kind of bad films they watch?But then, take a step back. That is what this film does for me. Seymour and Enid think they don't fit into a slot, but, well, unfortunately they do. Which is why I can so easily fit myself into their places at different times in my own life. And make sure to note that Seymour says to Enid several times during the film, Yeah, I felt like that when I was your age, too. Sometimes it's sickening how no one seems to differ.The film is not perfect, however. Enid's schitck does get old after a while. My biggest problem, though, is the ending. SPOILERS. The trip on the mystery bus seems like a poetic ending at first, but, really, to me it seems more like a cop-out. The film isn't exactly going for realism. There is a lot of exaggeration. However, I think that it needed a more down-to-earth ending, one where some sort of decision was made. That would show that Enid has passed a point of no return, that she has grown. That magical bus ride is nothing more than an escape, an easy way out, an evasion.END SPOILERSThis film was directed by Terry Zwigoff, who directed one of my favorite films of all time, Crumb. Crumb, in my not-so-very-humble opinion, is one of the most perfect films ever made, and easily the best documentary I've ever seen. That film was released in 1994. Zwigoff made one documentary before that, I think in the mid-1980s, but I'm not sure. I haven't seen it, but perhaps I should seek it out. Anyhow, please, please, please, Terry, don't let another seven years pass before you direct another film. I'm pretty sure that Ghost World was relatively successful. It has been a critical smash, at any rate (well, that hardly matters). Please, find something or write something that you find worthy and make another film out of it. Trust me, if you send out another one as good as this in a couple of years, you'll be a household name. 9\/10.

You think you're the only person who differs at all from all the others. Do you hear the kind of crappy music they listen to? The kind of bad films they watch?But then, take a step back. That is what this film does for me. Seymour and Enid think they don't fit into a slot, but, well, unfortunately they do. Which is why I can so easily fit myself into their places at different times in my own life. And make sure to note that Seymour says to Enid several times during the film, Yeah, I felt like that when I was your age, too. Sometimes it's sickening how no one seems to differ.The film is not perfect, however. Enid's schitck does get old after a while. My biggest problem, though, is the ending. SPOILERS. The trip on the mystery bus seems like a poetic ending at first, but, really, to me it seems more like a cop-out. The film isn't exactly going for realism. There is a lot of exaggeration. However, I think that it needed a more down-to-earth ending, one where some sort of decision was made. That would show that Enid has passed a point of no return, that she has grown. That magical bus ride is nothing more than an escape, an easy way out, an evasion.END SPOILERSThis film was directed by Terry Zwigoff, who directed one of my favorite films of all time, Crumb. Crumb, in my not-so-very-humble opinion, is one of the most perfect films ever made, and easily the best documentary I've ever seen. That film was released in 1994. Zwigoff made one documentary before that, I think in the mid-1980s, but I'm not sure. I haven't seen it, but perhaps I should seek it out. Anyhow, please, please, please, Terry, don't let another seven years pass before you direct another film. I'm pretty sure that Ghost World was relatively successful. It has been a critical smash, at any rate (well, that hardly matters). Please, find something or write something that you find worthy and make another film out of it. Trust me, if you send out another one as good as this in a couple of years, you'll be a household name. 9\/10.

Enid's life is a lot like my own experience, or at least my own attitude, when I reached the end of high school. And now, half a decade later, I'm growing into Seymour at a rapid rate (with movies instead of music). I imagine that Seymour is a lot like Zwigoff, and I feel like I must be like him.
