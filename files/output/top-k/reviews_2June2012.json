After 5 minutes I was hooked. To me the best thing about Breakdown is its real-life portrayal of ordinary people undergoing a sudden trauma. The second best thing is the non-stop action. But Kurt Russell in particular does a great job acting a man facing up to evil situation, and his gradual adjustment. In a typical tough-guy beat-em-up movie, the hero would be taking control of the situation right away. But in Breakdown, the bad guys have the upper hand, and a nearly fool-proof plan for getting away with extortion and likely murder. Russell at first is confused what is happening, then when the villains demand the money, he is finally able to think of his alternatives. All the while his face shows his torn emotions, still not quite believing what has happened to him, fighting panic, but forcing himself to think clearly. As the story moves along, he realizes these guys may actually plan to kill both of them even after they get the ransom, which is a whole new dilemma. He can swear to vent his frustration but that is about it. No heroics will save his wife until the time is right, and Russell shows that agony in those moments he has to submit to the kidnappers. JT Barr also makes a great cold-blooded villain, maintaining his cool from the start. And Quinlain, who I love as an actress (think Apollo 13) doesn't have a big role but she plays it perfectly. See this movie for a lesson in how good actors can overcome a middle budget movie and make it well worth watching.

It's highly moralizing too, thus providing a perfect form of escapism to those who are sick with modern society. Dialogues are 'uncovered', uncalculated. Characters just say what they've got to say. To portray such a wide foray of emotive dialogues is not only daring from a director's point of view but also daring as people are not quickly content and seek many metaphors, non-direct plots and other figures of speech in modern movies.This movie is not one for the videophiles per se,but then again it's one for the ones among us that want to be stirred not by the cinematic qualities but by the underlying morals and naked emotions.

From the 1920's to now, it doesn't matter, I love the myth, the horror and characters. In the 1980's, we had a few vampire movies, the most famous being The Lost Boys which is named as one of the all time favorites with fans when it comes to vampire movies. But it just so happened that the same year, another movie was made, a little independent film that kind of got the shaft in the advertising department compared to The Lost Boys and wasn't as much of a success, it's called Near Dark. I had always seen the cover whenever I went to the video store when I was a kid, but I have to admit that the VHS cover wasn't that appealing, so I feel bad that I gave the film a pass until now. I saw a lot of buzz on the internet when people talk about vampire films, this one came up quite a bit. I bought it on the spot and watched it a few weeks ago, I can see why this one made the top list a few times.One night, Caleb, a young man, meets a young drifter named Mae. Just before sunrise, she bites him on the neck then runs off. The rising sun causes Caleb's flesh to begin to burn. Mae comes with a group of roaming vampires and takes him away. The most unsociable of all the vampires, wanting to kill Caleb, but Mae reveals she has turned him into a vampire. Their charismatic leader, Jesse, reluctantly agrees to allow Caleb to remain with them for a week to see if he can learn to hunt and become a trusted member of their group. Caleb is unwilling to kill to feed, which alienates him from the others. To protect him, Mae kills for him then has him drink from her wrist. They are running short on their tempers to keep him in the group. Meanwhile, his family is looking for him and the gang of vampires may have found a new way of initiation for Caleb.So the good with this film the vampires. One of the things I did like a lot that we don't get to see in some vampire films is that we get to know them not as monsters, but that they were once human. Also the frustration you feel for Homer, the little vampire, he's an old man trapped in a boy's body, something that was way before Interview with the Vampire with the character Claudia. Now it's not as detailed but it's still sad to see his struggles as he has a man's needs, but it looks wrong when you have a young boy hitting on an older woman. He's also smarter than the leader but can't do as much since it's an adult's world. Then we have Severon, played by Bill Paxton, and you can tell he had a lot of fun with this role. He looks and acts tough, he's the vampire you don't want to mess with, add in the dark humor and he's just vicious. Jesse, played Lance Henriksen, has charisma and you can tell off the bat, he's the dad of the family. Diamondback, played by Jenette Goldstein, is beautiful but deadly and like a mom to Homer. The love story between Caleb and Mae is sweet, but I don't think that was the true heart of the story as you find yourself more involved with the other vampires.The costumes, make up and sets are very cool. You have a great set of a western with a mix of biker, which can be contradicting at times, it does over all work. But there are some flaws with the movie. The ending is a huge cop out, which a lot of people seem to be in agreement with. I like the whole myth that if you haven't fed, if there is a transfusion of human blood put back into your body after being bit, you can return to normal. But then they do this with Mae, who was a full vampire and it felt like a cop out with unanswered questions. Did she want to be human? She didn't complain that much about being a vampire. Also when she bit Caleb, she barely bites him and he's turning into a vampire 5 minutes after? That's like saying when I get bit by a mosquito, I'll turn into one. The ending wasn't very well thought out and this film had so much more potential than they give. Maybe with a better budget I think this could've beaten a lot of vampire movies out of the water. But it's still a good one that I would recommend and would gladly watch again.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 June 2012","score":"","review":" It's no secret, I love vampire movies, you can tell from my comments, I've seen a lot of them.

Ljubica Adzovic who plays the grandmother is deserving of an Oscar nod, her performance is superb at being the rock of the family. The main protagonist Perhan is a young boy who is coming of age and is driven by love. When he asks his girlfriend's mother for her hand in marriage, the mother shuts him down because he doesn't have any money.

As an adult I have found new enjoyment in this movie for its humor and high quality animation.Roger Rabbit brought back the slapstick and wild antics of cartoons from earlier years. I recall John K. mentioning at one point, that cartoons stopped being cartoons-- which I agree with. In the 80s although I loved them, cartoons shied away from from over-sized eyes popping out of heads, anthropomorphic animals getting flattened like pancakes, the iconic birds and stars around the protagonist's head, and of course-- faces transforming into steam whistles. Never in my life did I see a My Little Pony and Care Bears episode where characters exploded, caught on fire or were sucked down toilets-- and moreover, if it had happened, I don't think it would be written as something to laugh about.This film reminded audiences of the potentialities of animation to do something actors on film couldn't do. They can make us laugh because of the medium they are made with (i.e. it's much more funny in my own opinion to see a hand drawn cartoon character dance around, than watching Jim Carrey in The Mask dance to big band music). I digress-- anyways, WFRR played with the jokes and gags from older cartoons, many kids my age hadn't seen or cared for. My God-Children have seen this film, and they love Roger Rabbit and his girlfriend (they are three and four years old, still can't seem to remember that her name is Jessica ^^). There is a blend of art and reality that they've been exposed to--that has inspired new play.Hands down, this film was before its time. Finding a way to meld the world of animation and real-life is not an easy one-- and I hope that there will be more of our fuzzy friend on the big screen-- someday.

Hitchcock has Rope, a movie even he was a bit ashamed to put on the big screens for some time. It's probably safe to say that this is one of a very few attempts that 'didn't work out' in his long and marvelous career in filmmaking. However, its remarkable unconventionality in the sense of play-like editing technique and the way its storyline is build should be sufficient enough to make it worth a view.The story starts with a brutal scene, which may be considered a spoiler that in result kills all the suspense and mystery. However, throughout the whole story only the viewer knows what happened, so that the effect of a spoiler accounts only for the outcome, but doesn't relate to the events that occur in-between. Two homosexual students (John Dall and Farley Granger) fascinated by the nature of a 'superior being' strangle (with the titular rope) their friend, who they think is worse than they are, and put his body in a grand trunk in the middle of a room, where they later throw a party for a few guests. One of them is their professor Rupert Cadell (James Stewart).Not knowing that a corpse is in the same room all the time, everybody is trying to have a good time. However, they are wondering why David, the killed boy, isn't here yet and the overly mistrustful professor begins to suspect that something strange is going on. Phillip, one of the boys, starts to crack up a little. There is one fantastic scene, where Rupert is questioning Phillip, while he plays the piano. With every next question he seems tenser and plays along faster than before. Yet Brandon, on the other hand, is in control of the situation and enjoys the whole set-up like it was some kind of a pleasurable game. He uses intelligent word play to talk a bit about David's absence. Then it all goes out of control, as Phillip isn't able to take the pressure any more and starts to think that everyone already knows of the gruesome murder that the boys committed.I've always been amazed by Hitchcock's ability to render the element of suspense in such a jaw-dropping manner, that even when the viewer is fully aware that the dead body is lying in the piano for the whole time, he is still feeling the mysterious aura and experiences it along with the characters.Due to the fact that Hitchcock wanted to make it look like a real time play he had to shoot it in 10 few-minutes-long sequences and put them together, so that the whole movie would look like a one long shot. Unfortunately, this experiment didn't work out as well as it was supposed to, and the movie wasn't able to generate much attention in the process. Even though even James Stewart wasn't very fond of the movie himself, I still think that everyone, who wants to know the true Hitchcock, has to watch Rope. It doesn't loose any of the director's mastery of suspense and mysterious atmosphere, and definitely provides for a thrilling ride without leaving a single room.

Initially, I was reluctant to watch it due to the poster... what, a capsule? I stereotypically thought of it as just another bizarre 1980s cyberpunk film with giant robots and Matrix styled sh*t... all that my uncle was interested in... given that I had a shallow understanding of what the culture was all about.How wrong I was.The opening was the most epic of any film I've seen so far (besides Oldboy and City of God). It set the mood for the entire film perfectly. I was in awe... growing up alongside Disney animated movies, what other cartoon opens with a gigantic nuclear explosion? It was utterly brilliant from that point on - a hypnotic trip through the underbelly of a society on the verge of collapsing. Being politically conscious and having lived through observing numerous cases of widespread corruption and oppression in my country, as well as being a bullied, angry teen with discipline issues. I immediately resonated with what Otomo was trying to express. The animation was unlike anything I've ever seen... the music was great and unique... and you get my point.However, what startled me the most was the movie's message. Being 13 when I watched it, it wasn't really clear to me... the first few minutes were instances of mindless action and rioting... it was crazy and to a point, near extremist to me. Yet, the film never loses its way of providing unpredictable surprises, especially during the end. The film left me speechless, shocked and awed by the sheer brutality of it.What was the film trying to tell? Beyond the madness, I thought that maybe humans could never be given the power of God... see what Tetsuo became during the end... he was overwhelmed... I'd leave that disturbing scene to your imagination as not to spoil it for you people.

Every Which Way But Loose was the second highest grossing (no pun intended) film of 1978...and yet it's practically plot-less and a completely brainless film. It's not 100% terrible, but it is pretty bad--especially as the film becomes tiresome the longer it goes. But, despite this, because it made so much money (people were apparently VERY easy to please in 1978), they soon made a sequel--which I can pretty much guarantee you I'll never be watching! Clint Eastwood plays a guy who loves to bare knuckle fight. Often he does it to win prize money, often he does it just because someone irritated him. Throughout the film, Eastwood gets in one fight after another--and this tended to disrupt the plot--what little there was of it. Eventually, a group of bikers and off-duty cops who he's beaten up go looking for him. But, since Eastwood has gone on a road trip to find a woman he's smitten with (Sondra Locke), they spend much of the movie looking for him--and they end up going on a road trip after him.The film is absolutely stupid in parts. Clyde the Orangutan was at times a bit funny, but talk about contrived!! Ma (Ruth Gordon) cursed like a sailor and was violent. This was supposed to be funny, but like the ape, it wore thin pretty quickly. In addition, there is the dopey biker gang (sort of like the Three Stooges times three) who just seem too stupid and ineffectual to be anything other than comic relief. There are also fart jokes, belching, punch sound effects that make bad martial arts films seem realistic and the like thrown in to boot. It's really the sort of stuff 13 year-olds love laughing at--but I just thought it was all pretty tiresome and well beneath the talents of Eastwood. Add lots of punching and country music and you pretty much get the point of the film. Fortunately, after wasting his time on this movie (and making a bazillion dollars) he went on to far better things.

I watched it streaming on Netflix and it was a very dark and muddy copy--and left a lot to be desired.Harry (Clint Eastwood) is a tough cop. He's good at his job but often gets on the wrong side of his superiors due to his propensity to leave a long trail of bodies in dispensing justice. And, throughout the film, he delivers--one amazing act of insane bravery after another. In this first installment, he's after a psycho serial killer who calls himself 'Scorpio'. Scorpio has begun killing random folks and is extorting money out of the city to make him stop. Considering that there are four sequels to this film, you can pretty safely assume that in the end, Harry will come out on top.Dirty Harry is a cop film from a new generation of gritty anti-hero cop films. While it's not among the first (the late 60s saw such films as Madigan and The Detective), it was certainly dirty in every sense. The film is raw--bloody, violent, peppered with spicy language and racial epithets as well as nudity. This is NOT a movie to show the kids and your mother! When the film was shown on TV for the first time, significant chunks were cut. Even compared to films today, this is a pretty rough film. On the other hand, you've gotta admit that it's great entertainment. The script is solid, the film (oddly) has an unusual sense of humor and the acting is excellent all around.By the way, although I really enjoyed this film, the best San Francisco cop film still, in my opinion, is Bullitt.

After an afternoon's hard drinking, a man the soldiers meet in a bar is murdered. It looks like one of the soldiers, Mitch Mitchell (George Cooper), did it, but the police flounder when it comes to finding a motive. The soldier's sergeant, Keeley (Robert Mitchum) is convinced the suspect didn't do the crime and sets out to uncover the true killer himself.The always-terrific Gloria Grahame plays an embittered bar hostess who might be able to give Mitch the nearest thing to an alibi he's going to get. Not sure I like Gloria as a bleached blonde, but the look suits her character exactly.Mitchum's performance is even more laid-back than usual and you get the feeling he thinks he's slumming it in this low-budget picture.
