The fight sequences are few and far in between.  The in between is really boring. You are once treated to a edge of the seat fight scene followed by long melodramatic scenes.But that is not the worst part. The story. The story is such typical run of the mill Asian movie fare, it is not even funny. Clich√© stuff such as brotherhood\/sisterhood, rebellious love affair, revenge, unrequited love, feminism, lofty romantic dialogues (Take a leap of faith and your desire will come true), the lengthy dramatized death of the male protagonist all packaged in the film with no interrelations. The scene in the restaurant although greatly performed, really was there for enticement purposes. Can anybody give me a justification for that sequence or it's bearing with the story?The Character played by Zhang Ziyi I could not figure out if I should like her, despise her or sympathize with her. She is brash, she is skillful, but not disciplined. But she doesn't get disciplined even in the end. So I am to assume that although she is undisciplined she can do all the feats of the masters that they have achieved with years of meditation and practice. She realizes Jade Fox is really evil and cunning, but she is mad at Li mu Bai and the character played by Yeoh. She goes from Yeoh's sister to foe before you can read the subtitle (literally one sentence). I could understand what she did not want from her life but I still cannot fathom what she wants in life. She does not want to be a student, something Jade Fox gripes about that she was not given an opportunity, because she was a woman. She does not want the lover she found of her own means. She is really not a protector of the underprivileged masses, she only beats up people who disturb her meal. Can anybody explain to me what she wanted in life?Character played by Chow Yun Fat The guy went into meditation and reached a place where there was much disturbance. He realized he needed to avenge his masters death and find Jade Fox. Oh well so much for meditative ways of non violence. So he is back into his role as a warrior. But then why relinquish your weapon. You relinquish your weapon and take up full time meditation or vice versa. How can you do both?Character played by Michelle Yeoh We understand women were not trained to be warriors, then where the hell did she get her education?The movie is typical Asian movie fare where you have piecemeal slices of the various contexts, namely love, action, emotion, etc. Humor was evidently missing from this cliche ridden movie, but I am sure director Ang Lee may have toyed with the idea of pushing a comedian in there somewhere (characters in restaurant and their American football team names).The western media and audience do not see very many Asian films and hence the movie looks refreshing. There is a long-established genre in Chinese film and literature called Wuxia. The Wuxia were a class of knights during the time of  Confucius, who in this fantasy-based fiction often have magical abilities like flight (actually more like gravity-free leaps), and speed, reflexes and strength of superhuman levels. Chinese movies about them, called Wuxia Pien, have been made for decades, but few have had the budget or the expected worldwide release that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has had. One of the best movies I have seen in the Kung-Fu genre (and even as a film) still remains (As released in the country that I saw) The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (originally titled Shao Lin san shih liu fang). Yeah, typical kung fu fighting movie, perhaps even lacking in form compared to CTHD, but in terms of content, Par Excellence.Ask yourself after you see CTHD, if those fight sequences were to be removed and replaced with run of the mill martial arts action sequences, would you still call it a great movie (Love story)? On the other hand if the romance was removed, would it still be a great Martial Arts movie? The two aspects were incongruously placed in the film and overall the story lacked sense and reason. CTHD has been touted as Sense and Sensibility meets Martial arts. I found it more as Sense and Sensibility incoherently interspersed with Martial arts. Crouching... is as lousy as it can get. It's characters are uninspiring and the film unlike other Wuxia movies is really spiritually hollow.

In what may be a most telling scene, when the main character has an accident and wakes up in the hospital, she just happens to be in the pediatric ward; perhaps giving those to whom this insipid drivel would appeal something with which to relate?  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  In regards to `The Wedding Planner,' directed (more or less) by Adam Shankman, that last comment should've been reserved for later, but by then I may have had to make it `cliche-ridden' insipid drivel.  Actually, early on this film seemed to have some promise; but then the opening credits ended and it was all downhill from there.  It may ring of paranoia, but the makers of this movie-- though unable to deny responsibility since they did, in fact, make it-- may have been able to make a case that they had been the victims of a conspiracy of sorts, beginning with the cast they assembled to bring it all to life.  I can think of no other movie that boasts such a grossly unappealing, miscast bunch of actors, beginning with Alex Rocco as Salvatore, the father of Mary Fiore, the character played by Jennifer Lopez.  Mull that over for just a moment, if you will; Rocco as Lopez's father.... \tFor the life of me, I cannot understand Jennifer Lopez; she's beautiful and talented, and seemingly bent on making as many mistakes, career-wise, as she possibly can.  Perhaps I should make that `artistic' mistakes, since with her singing career and being given the opportunity to make movies (even ones like this) she is probably going to be very materially well-off, even if she continues to do nothing of artistic merit for the rest of her life.  Maybe when the teenyboppers have grown tired of her (which shouldn't be too long) and she realizes that she will only be able to invade Brittany Spears territory so far, she will go back to what she is really good at, making movies like `Selena,' and `Out Of Sight,' in which she demonstrated what kind of acting chops she has.  How ironic that in this film she plays a wedding planner, when what she needs in real life is a `career planner' for herself.  It just seems like such a shame that `J. Lo' has taken the fast-track to fame and fortune instead of employing her myriad gifts to better purpose.  That she looks attractive in this film cannot be denied, but neither can it be denied that as far as her acting, it was nothing more than a walk-through for her. \tMatthew McConaughey, meanwhile, winds up in even murkier waters than Lopez here, with his portrayal of Dr. Steve `Eddie' Edison, the character whom circumstances bring into contact with Mary Fiore at a pivotal point in his life.  He is engaged to Fran (Bridgette Wilson), but begins to have second thoughts about it after his encounter with Mary.  The plot line gets pretty complicated after that, and for anyone who has trouble keeping up with it, I can only suggest that they confer with some of those currently residing in that pediatric ward.  Any charm, charisma or screen presence McConaughey has must have been checked at the gate when he signed on for this one, because a more flat, uninspired performance you are unlikely to find without looking real hard.  Hold that thought; can anyone say Chris O'Donnell in `The Bachelor?'  And the lack of chemistry between McConaughey and Lopez is stupefying; interestingly enough, he has even less with Wilson.  The producers would've had to bring in truckloads of rocks and flint to ignite any sparks on this set. \tThe supporting cast includes Justin Chambers (Massimo), Judy Greer (Penny), Joanna Gleason (Mrs. Donolly), Charles Kimbrough (Mr. Donolly), Fred Willard (Basil St. Mosely), Kathy Najimy (Geri) and Kevin Pollak as Dr. Dojny (but don't blink or you'll miss him).

But Oscar?  Come on!  I saw many other HK movies with the same or better quality\/ plot, etc and they never got any nomination.  Why?  Because no one actually pays attention to HK movie until very recently.  And all of the sudden, people see this movie and go Oh WOW!If you are a true fan of a HK movie, you'll probably feel the same way as I do.  Many HK movies are really beautiful.  OK.

Where Psycho gave us Janet Leigh's getaway before turning its attention to Norman Bates, The Birds gives us Tippi Hedren's practical jokes before letting the winged freaks terrorise us.As is also the case with Psycho, the opening thread works well enough on its own, so that the gentle romantic comedy and Hedren's practical jokes feel like well-developed set-up rather than padding.  Hedren is effortlessly charming, and her smoker's voice is cute and occasionally sexy (before it was passed down a generation to become irritating).  The chemistry between her and Rod Taylor seems genuine enough, and the unspoken tension that comes from his ex-girlfriend and overbearing mother add depth to the characters.  It seems strange that so many reviews complain of the wafer-thin story; these are details and depths that would be hard to find in the set-up of most modern movies.Having Hedren's character as a practical joker is a nice touch, as most people know Hitchcock was a bit of a trickster himself.  You get the idea he's sniggering to himself behind the camera, thinking `my jokes are a lot meaner than hers!'  His sense of humour is perhaps more prominent than ever, and leads to my favourite shot in the whole film; as Hedren drives badly along winding roads, we see her love birds clinging on to their perch, leaning to one side and then to the other as she swerves all over the road.  It looks incredibly fake but it's just such an inventive idea you laugh with it rather than at it, which I suppose was the point.Once Hedren's flirting with Rod Taylor begins in earnest, and the story moves to Bodega Bay, the film begins to lose its similarities with Psycho.  Whereas the shower scene in Bates Motel changed the tone of the film instantly, here we are witness to a rather slow build-up and an impending sense of doom.  The tension is built with predictable expertise, so that things that shouldn't be scary genuinely are; when all you hear is a flapping of wings it's scary, when all you see is a bird landing on a climbing frame it's scary.  The effects have aged quite badly, but they are no real barrier to the tension and fear you will feel, although you probably get more from the film if you're not too keen on birds already.  While I haven't got a phobia I could live quite happily without their flapping wings and biting beaks so all the movie's tricks worked on me.As other reviews have pointed out, the most noticeable difference with Psycho comes in what we are allowed to see.  Shadows and chocolate sauce were enough to scare in Psycho, but in The Birds we see everything, including a horrible shot of a corpse whose eyes have been pecked out.  It is testament to Hitchcock's skill that he could approach these movies so differently and have them both work so well, each scaring the audience in their own way.The ending is deliberately abrupt, and I'm not quite sure if I liked it or not.  It was a nice idea to suggest that this wasn't the end of the story, just the end for these characters, but as with most older movies the absence of an end credit sequence means there is no time within the film to think about it.  It was probably a little too abrupt, but it is hard to see how else it could have ended.My main recommendation for the film is that for a few days after seeing it, I noticed loads more birds than usual on the wires and rooftops outside my house, and felt rather suspicious of why there were there.  I'm sure Hitchcock would have wanted it that way.

This view of the novel is surprisingly accurate, and the movie is helped along by it. Granted, the family at the centre of the story is in the business of crime, but the story is more about the family than the crimes.The head of this family is Don Vito Corleone, played to perfection by Marlon Brando. His mannerisms, and the mannerisms of any other mob boss who has survived assination attempts and wars, are captured marvellously in Brando's performance. At no stage did I have any problem believing that I was watching a mob boss rather than an actor just playing his part. Then, of course, there's the three sons Santino (James Caan), Frederico (John Cazale), and Michael (Al Pacino). The first two of these young men are unsuitable to succeed their father as head of the family business. The youngest, and most unwilling, is ironically the most suitable. This touch makes me wonder if Mario Puzo read Plato a lot when he was writing The Godfather, for it was Plato who said that the unwilling make the best rulers. Filling out the family's ranks are Constanzia Corleone (Talia Shire), who is getting married on the day the film opens to Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), and Vito's adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). There isn't a single member of the cast, at least where these important roles are concerned, who doesn't play their part to a disbelief-suspending perfection.As I mentioned previously, the film is more about the family than their business activities. Indeed, the business side of the story really only exists for plot movement. While the film cannot capture every single detail from the novel, such as the intricacies of the business, it does an excellent job of filling out the details. I've yet to see another film where this much detail from the original novel has made its way into the screenplay. Critics accuse this film of being overlength, but this is a load of cobblers. Having sat through a television broadcast of this film that took up four hours once the commercials were accounted for, I can tell you that the film is absolutely riveting. Whether it is the story, the characters, or Nino Rota's amazing score music, this film has everything it takes to keep a viewer glued to the screen for its entire length. Even the slowest part of the film, Michael's pilgrimage in Sicily, is delightful to watch due to its cinematography and doomed romance between Michael and Apollonia.As a matter of fact, the only criticism I have of The Godfather and its first sequel is that the back story of Vito Corleone wasn't developed enough. There are numerous details, such as how Luca Brasi came to be in Vito's employ, which should have been shown in the film. The role of Mama Corleone was also somewhat underdeveloped, as her interaction with Kay Adams was a critically important element of the novel. I don't think she was ever known by any other name in the novel, either, but she was still a living, breathing character with concerns and feelings of her own. Something she was stripped of in the film. All of these elements could have used some screentime because they help the reader\/viewer to understand Vito Corleone as a human being as well as as a mob boss.Aside from that one minor complaint, however, The Godfather is the best screen translation of a novel in the history of the art form. Francis Ford Coppola should be knighted for this movie, as he stands head and shoulders above anyone else who has attempted this feat (Stanley Kubrick's failure to get half the detail of The Short Timers, a 180-page novel where half the words are expletives, into Full Metal Jacket, anyone?).

All of these elements could have used some screentime because they help the reader\/viewer to understand Vito Corleone as a human being as well as as a mob boss.Aside from that one minor complaint, however, The Godfather is the best screen translation of a novel in the history of the art form. Francis Ford Coppola should be knighted for this movie, as he stands head and shoulders above anyone else who has attempted this feat (Stanley Kubrick's failure to get half the detail of The Short Timers, a 180-page novel where half the words are expletives, into Full Metal Jacket, anyone?). ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"26 February 2001","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather was a sweeping tale spanning two generations with a tale that, as director Francis Ford Coppola states, is more the tale of a king with three sons than of a mob war. This view of the novel is surprisingly accurate, and the movie is helped along by it. Granted, the family at the centre of the story is in the business of crime, but the story is more about the family than the crimes.The head of this family is Don Vito Corleone, played to perfection by Marlon Brando. His mannerisms, and the mannerisms of any other mob boss who has survived assination attempts and wars, are captured marvellously in Brando's performance. At no stage did I have any problem believing that I was watching a mob boss rather than an actor just playing his part. Then, of course, there's the three sons Santino (James Caan), Frederico (John Cazale), and Michael (Al Pacino). The first two of these young men are unsuitable to succeed their father as head of the family business. The youngest, and most unwilling, is ironically the most suitable. This touch makes me wonder if Mario Puzo read Plato a lot when he was writing The Godfather, for it was Plato who said that the unwilling make the best rulers. Filling out the family's ranks are Constanzia Corleone (Talia Shire), who is getting married on the day the film opens to Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), and Vito's adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). There isn't a single member of the cast, at least where these important roles are concerned, who doesn't play their part to a disbelief-suspending perfection.As I mentioned previously, the film is more about the family than their business activities. Indeed, the business side of the story really only exists for plot movement. While the film cannot capture every single detail from the novel, such as the intricacies of the business, it does an excellent job of filling out the details. I've yet to see another film where this much detail from the original novel has made its way into the screenplay. Critics accuse this film of being overlength, but this is a load of cobblers. Having sat through a television broadcast of this film that took up four hours once the commercials were accounted for, I can tell you that the film is absolutely riveting. Whether it is the story, the characters, or Nino Rota's amazing score music, this film has everything it takes to keep a viewer glued to the screen for its entire length. Even the slowest part of the film, Michael's pilgrimage in Sicily, is delightful to watch due to its cinematography and doomed romance between Michael and Apollonia.As a matter of fact, the only criticism I have of The Godfather and its first sequel is that the back story of Vito Corleone wasn't developed enough. There are numerous details, such as how Luca Brasi came to be in Vito's employ, which should have been shown in the film. The role of Mama Corleone was also somewhat underdeveloped, as her interaction with Kay Adams was a critically important element of the novel. I don't think she was ever known by any other name in the novel, either, but she was still a living, breathing character with concerns and feelings of her own. Something she was stripped of in the film. All of these elements could have used some screentime because they help the reader\/viewer to understand Vito Corleone as a human being as well as as a mob boss.Aside from that one minor complaint, however, The Godfather is the best screen translation of a novel in the history of the art form.

But with his jokes and rather un-orthodox way of teaching, he wins over the 'ever-so reluctant to give in' students right away. That done, he encouters Martin, the grumpy deaf girl, who has secluded herself from the hearing world by choice. He knows he has to help her out right away. So they meet and as expected the first meeting is a tango between the 2. And the movie races on with its frantic pace, without intending to pause for a while to develop the sub-plots, to explore the world of deaf people and delve more into the relationship between a hearing man and a deaf woman. The relationship between Hurt and Martin is more specific, as Martin is not just a deaf girl trying to lead a normal life. Her past traumas, her painful experiences with hearing men has made her so in-penetratable. This could have happened to any girl. Its just a coincidence that she's deaf.  The relationship has been shown through the eyes of Hurt, so its more about his struggle to penetrate through the shell that Martin has created to to protect herself from the cruel hearing world. Even Martin's words are spoken by Hurt, though this was more of a tehcnical issue as you don't expect the audience to learn sign language before watching the film, I felt there were opportunities where her eyes, her gestures could have spoken the words more dynamically than Hurt's words.

The psychological games between Hannibal and everyone's favorite F.B. I. agent, Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore), that began in `The Silence of the Lambs,' continues here, though the tension that permeated `Lambs' has been significantly reduced, mainly due to the fact that this film lacks the immediacy of the original.  Though Hannibal's presence is still coldly threatening, he simply hasn't that same sense of urgency about him in his freedom that he did in captivity.  Seeing him in a `normal' setting is just much easier to assimilate than seeing him in that ominous isolation cell in which he resided when first introduced to an unsuspecting audience in 1991.   \tProbably the most chilling aspect of the film is the fact that someone as unsound as Hannibal can with such facility mask his true identity and compulsions and function so effectively within society.  It's like living among snakes without knowing which ones are venomous.  As a viewer, watching him interact with others-- knowing what we do about him-- is unnerving in itself; and when things begin to heat up and he at last shows his hand, it accords the audience some relief, in the same sense as having an illness finally diagnosed so that you can begin the treatment which precludes healing. And any respite from the ambiguous horrors of the story is welcomed, since Scott has done a superb job of creating an atmosphere and mood that poise the audience for the worst of the definite atrocities that are obviously coming. \tAs for the performance of Anthony Hopkins, it goes without saying at this point that he IS Hannibal Lecter.  In reviving the role that won him an Oscar for Best Actor, he brings that same icy countenance to the screen, that same reserved manner and eyes that reflect an emptiness of soul, all of which creates an illusion of invulnerability about him.  He presents a portrait of someone who is quite capable of perpetrating acts so dark that even shadows could not prevail upon them.  And taking into account the intelligence of Lecter, and the calculating methods he employs in carrying out his heinous deeds, it makes his presence all the more disquieting, more so even than that of Norman Bates (as played by Anthony Perkins) in Hitchcock's `Psycho.' \tIf at all a case could be made that there is a weak link in the film, it would have to be the presence of Julianne Moore; but it would be a tough case to make inasmuch as Moore cannot be held directly responsible for it.  She simply had a nearly impossible task in attempting to fill the shoes of Jodie Foster, who made such an indelible impression as Clarice in `Lambs,' for which she received the Oscar for Best Actress.  Moore is a gifted actress, and her performance here is quite capably realized, but she doesn't quite capture that spark of intimacy that Foster's Clarice had with Hannibal, and consequently what passes between them does not evoke that same sense of dread and apprehension that was so vividly felt before.  Moore must be given credit, however, for a noble effort-- she does give a good performance here-- but taking over a part that Foster had made so intrinsically her own was a task that was just too insurmountable. \tThe supporting cast includes Giancarlo Giannini (Rinaldo Pazzi), Francesca Neri (Laura Pazzi), Gary Oldman (Mason Verger), Ray Liotta (Paul Krendler), Alex Corrado (Piero), Zeljko Ivanek (Dr. Doemling), Spike Jonze (Donnie) and Frankie Faison (Barney).  There are some fairly graphic scenes in this film, but with the exception of one near the end, they all play out very quickly; this is not, after all, merely another `slice &#145;em and dice &#145;em' slasher film.  Scott presents the story in such a way that the audience is psychologically and emotionally primed to see more than is actually shown; this is simply good filmmaking.  But be advised  Some of it will be a bit too strong for some.  In the end, `Hannibal,' though falling short of the level of excellence of `Silence of the Lambs,' is still a film that makes the ten years or so it took to bring it to the screen worth the wait.  Not for the squeamish nor those with a fragile psyche, it is a film, however, for those who would sojourn into regions beyond the known; if it is the dark places you seek, this one should more than fit the bill.

The noble family in decline, the crumbling family house, the steady, overpowering incremence of nature onto civilisation, the generational conflict where the hopes of youth are tainted with decadence of the past, the climactic storm scene that brings everything to a head.  These are all staples of the Gothic story, and although the world of the film blazes in an intolerable sun, the film itself is shrouded in ominous, often impenetrable shadows (although, admittedly, the print I saw was very saturated).  But this is not a study of an old, fat, corrupt, European country hobbling on its last legs, the usual subject of classic Gothic, but a newly emergent nation less than a decade old.  Is the film, like most Gothic fiction, an allegory for the nation?  Ray doesn't make hammering political points - there are references to a neighbouring landlord who probably conned the gullible family of land; there is the bizarre and comic sight of impoverished elders in tatty British uniforms playing a discordant brass version of 'It's a long way to Tipperary'.  The hideous old crone for whom Durga steals fruit, and whose presence exasperates her mother, is called India - it is tempting to see her age, her expulsion, her constant need for water, her enlisting the young in dangerous schemes to feed her, her abandonment, her lonely death by a stream, as some kind of allegorical reading, but of what?  Certainly, throughout, Ray is constantly pushing his realism further than mere observation, so that scenes that seem simply to record a way of life are pregnant with hidden meanings.  For instance, the harrowing depiction of poverty is frequently disrupted by spectacle and play, from the children's games to the theatrical melodramas that enrapture Apu.  Even Ray's style continually, disarmingly changes registers, alternating calm, distant compositions with urgent sequences broken up by strange angles, choppy editing, heightened music and sound.  The film's structure seems to embody this duality between realism and the figurative.  The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature.  It is full of rich characterisation, even comedy, and full of set-pieces that reveal character and society.  The second half, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical.  There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action.  The nature that had been encroaching on civilisation spills over in these sequences, with stunning montages that recall Dovzhenko.  The whole film feels slower, more meaningful and monumental (and sometimes duller).  My favourite sequences are in this half, the discovery of the road and railway, the possibility of another life; the silent roaming through a beautiful, dwarfing landscape that recalls the mysticism of the Archers' 'A Canterbury Tale'.  This clash between nature and the home is expressed in the immediate terms of children growing up, their senses (and sensuality) awakening, seeing clearly the flaws of much-vaunted tradition.  The film is very acute about gender, to the point of schematism; the dependence of the culture on servile, worn-down women, the charming, irresponsibility of men, the doom of any girl who might seek independence (figures who quickly (or maybe always were) types).  The fate of Durga, after her sprightly impishness at the beginning is heartbreaking.  The film is also a sophisticated analysis of modes of representation and the nature of cinema, of looking, linked to social control - Apu's entrance, where, after a lengthy build-up, he returns the observing eye, is as shocking and exhilarating as 'Un Chien Andoulu'.

Personally, in my experience of the film (which I have seen now countless times), I don't find anything that grand. Indeed, to me The Graduate succeeds by being one of the best *minimalist* movies in American cinema.

It posits no doctrine, argues for no alternative lifestyle, and in general refuses to prostheletize or to make its hero into any kind of leader or paragon.  If audiences responded (and continue to respond, critics be damned) to Benjamin's plight, it is because of the intensity of *feeling* that is communicated, not to the quality of thought. Indeed it could not be, since the main item up for display in the movie is the degree to which Benjamin's ability for clear thought has been subsumed by confusion, fear, self consciousness, and an almost soul-annihilating depression.These oppressive qualities are communicated to the viewer through Mike Nichols' brilliantly meticulous camerawork. His dogged insistence, from the very first shot, of framing Benjamin in tight closeups even amidst (nay, especially amidst) a large group of people (the airport, his graduation party, the hotel) gives us an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia. We feel acutely the young man's sense of entrapment and exposure; at the party, as he runs upstairs to his room, the camera rushes to keep up - and it is as if Benjamin is trying even to escape being in this movie. Don't look at me! his pinched voice and wilted expression seem to cry out, leave me alone! I ask you, is there a soul among us who cannot relate to that feeling, who has not felt it at least briefly during different moments of his life - being the outcast, the lost soul, the one in pain amidst the gaiety or unconcern of the rest of the crowd? The conditions which lead Ben to feel this way are not specifically enumerated (beyond a vague expression of being unsure about his future), but they don't need to be.  The feelings are articulated so vividly - through camerawork and performance both - that they reach us on a visceral level, and we are free to fill in our own emotional backstory for them - thereby involving us more on an individual level than we would be if we were told more specific information about Ben.Dustin Hoffman here is totally unforgettable. He takes what is essentially a cipher character, and fills him in with such pathos and vulnerability that we can't ignore him or look away. Even as we laugh at him, we ache for him. He would do it again twenty years later in Rain Man - that trick of being overwhelmingly present in every scene and yet remaining such a total blank. How is that done? What internal rhythm does he allow us to lock into so as to keep him a compelling figure, and one who garners our full sympathy, while being at the same time a total cipher. I don't know, but that magical performer's trick of Hoffman's is, along with Nichols' painstaking camera work, what keeps this film vivid and compelling all these many years later. Yes, even as the story sputters in the second half, and even as Benjamin's relationship with Elaine Robinson remains sketchy and maddeningly unexamined. It doesn't matter because by then Hoffman and Nichols have pulled you into their spell you will follow Benjamin Braddock anywhere, accept anything he does at face value - you just don't want to take your eyes off him.Oh, and here's to you, Mrs. Robinson. Her seduction scenes with Ben are some of the richest jewels in cinematic history. Their affair is, for both of them, a desperate and pathetic act, and their scenes together are charged with an almost overwhelming sadness and despair, which is strangely heightened (rather than alleviated) by the wicked humor these scenes also contain. It goes without saying that Anne Bancroft here is totally marvelous (just look at the way she says Art when Hoffman asks her what her major was in college to see how it's possible to pack a lifetime of rage and regret into just one word). But I am at pains to point out that, much as some have wanted to make her the piece's unsung and misunderstood hero, Mrs. Robinson is clearly and unmistakably the villain of the movie. She is cruel, manipulative, and (as the Simon and Garfunkel song about her would later suggest) quite possibly a borderline psycho case.  She represents the death urge - the power of spite and vindictiveness to choke out all other human feeling, including the desire to see anyone else's life turn out better than one's one.

Considering some of the fairly weighty creative talent behind some of the Wizards of the Coast products, it is puzzling to me how they managed to botch this movie so badly. I will attempt to summarise my major bones of contention below.Acting Jeremy Irons, as Profion, overacts with such enthusiasm it is a wonder he didn't rupture something vital. His irate, fist waving, finger pointing mockery of an evil archmage is a sterling endorsement for switching to decaffeinated coffee. I can only assume he's that angry because his agent thought this film would be a good career move.The so called 'heroes' fair little better. Ridly and Snails, played respectively, if not respectably, by Justin Whalin and Marlon Wheyans, horse around like a second rate Mel Gibson and Danny Glover from the Lethal Weapon film, using all manner of 20th century colloquialisms and slang, making them seem completely out of touch with the medieval setting. The dwarf says little, and does nothing. He joins the party with no explanation and for no discernible reason. The female mage whines incessantly and wears gradually more revealing outfits to please the 14 year old male gender demographic, the elven ranger scowls in her unlikely, and frankly perverse armour and it's all a hideous mess. The teenage Empress, shameless based on a character (Queen Amidala) ripped off from Star wars episode one, whines on about equality between commoner and mage until you actually *want* Profion to kill her. But he's too inept.The story is so full of holes it resembles a celluloid swiss cheese. Two major bloopersProfion steals the royal rod of gold dragon control, only to seemingly give it back later on. Why? Granted, it doesn't work for him, but it would have caused big problems for the good guys if he had he kept it. Or perhaps not. See next point.The Empress, attempting to get rid of Profion, summons the gold dragons to ATTACK HER OWN CITY. The heroes must be psychic, because they are questing for the rod of red dragon control for seemingly no real reason, then realise they can use it against the gold dragons...resulting in more collateral damage to the city. Oops. Bet your subjects love you, Empress Savina.In several scenes, this film rips off all three Indiana Jones movies, Star Wars 1,4,5 and 6, but has little of their style or panache. A lack of effort and originality combines into the worst two hours I have spent in a cinema. I can only hope there are no plans for a sequel.A small point. At no point during the opening credits do you see a Wizards of the Coast logo. Maybe they didn't like it either.

The cast included a long list of B-level stars, but good actors nonetheless.  I am personally a big fan of Alec Baldwin, David Paymer, and Charles Durning.  But no amount of big names could make up for a horrible script, very poor direction, and the worst cinematic score I have ever heard.Critiquing a movie like this is so hard because there is so much wrong with it.  And I had no intention of writing one until I read all of these rave reviews.I will start with what bothered me the most.  The music.  Not only was it boring and unpleasant to the ears, it was constant.  It began with opening credits and didn't end until the rolling credits.Next, I don't know much about David Mamet.  He had many talented actors to work with, but did not allow them to shine. Instead he turned them into one of his infamous Mamet-bots.  They are so busy trying to be cute that they lose any amount of interest that may have made them successful in the first place (ie. Philip Seymour Hoffman).There are so few moments in the movie that are funny.  The jokes that other people have referred to as clever because they go throughout the movie just don't work.  The big finale of BAZOOMS.COM being worked into the movie was so predictable that it lost any sense of wit.Chemistry between characters was also missing.  Another important element of movies that this one lacks.  The most obvious example is the supposed love interest between Hoffman and Pattie LuPone.  I never saw it or felt it. And who told LuPone that it if she cocked her head and smiled in every seen it would funny.  Its not.  Even the very likable LuPone manages to get under the viewer's skin.There are so many subplots that no single story gets the attention to fully form.  Which is probably a good thing since not a single story was ever interesting enough to grab my attention.From watching this movie this is what I have concluded about David Mamet. After some successful and entertaining movies he is now in a bubble.  He thinks that every idea he has deserves its own movie.  Someone should stop being Mamet's yes-man and let him know how it is.  All of his ideas aren't funny.  In fact, most of them are not.  Mamet appears to have undergone the same change that George Lucas has gone through.  They hit middle age and have lost their edge.This movie is boring, not witty, and a complete waste of time.  I rarely leave a movie with nothing good to say, but this one of them.

I haven't read Thomas Harris' novel, so I can't judge if the movie is a step up or a step down.  Judged on its own merits, 'Hannibal' is a slickly-produced, well-acted film, but it fails to generate much real suspense or tension throughout its elaborate proceedings.I have to agree with the critics taking Hannibal Lecter out of his cell and out on the streets makes him least mysterious and interesting.  What was so fascinating about Hannibal in 'Manhunter' and 'Silence of the Lambs' was how, despite his physical incarceration, he still had the power to get under a person's skin or into their very minds.  And, like all good horror films, it was the implication of what he might do that intrigued far more than the acting out of it onscreen.  In fact, when Lecter did finally cut loose in 'Lambs' to do in a pair of Tennessee cops, director Jonathan Demme wisely kept the gore low, but the atmosphere to the maximum.  Ridley Scott lets blood, brains and intestines run freely in his film.In'Hannibal' we get to watch the good doctor hack and slice to his gourmet delight.  Although it was entertaining to watch Anthony Hopkins back in action, and at times, the sheer relish he had with the role had an infectious (though demented) joy about it, there didn't seemed to be any real weight behind his actions.Julianne Moore did an fine job with her portrayal of Clarice Starling, and I didn't find myself missing Jodie Foster.  The problem isn't with her acting, it's with the script.  Though it is logical that in the intervening decade, Clarice would have become a harder, more battle-weary FBI expert, the story suffers because it was her innocence that made her dance with the demonic Lecter so fascinating.  In 'Lambs', Clarice had challenges both external (as a trainee agent tracking down serial killer Buffalo Bill) and internal (matching wits with Lecter - a man who might eat your soul if not your liver).  Here, she's more workmanlike in her approach, and because she doesn't scare as easily anymore, neither does the audience.  In 'Lambs' we saw the world through Clarice's eyes, and shared in her fears and triumphs. It's impossible to watch 'Hannibal' without cynically thinking about how much the film (and the novel it was based on) are largely motivated with the public's fascination and desire for more Lecter product (evidenced by the awful serial killer knock-offs that followed 'Lambs').

It seems to me that Harris and company simply failed to come up with anything really new or original to do with Hannibal and Clarice and felt content to re-hash what (apparently) worked before, though like many photocopies, beauty runs only skin deep.

I was captivated from beginning to end, but I need to take a somewhat controversial stand on the movie. I thinks it's good, far better than most of what Hollywood churns out, but a classic for the ages? I don't think you should go that far.Here's my main problem This movie does not contain a single likable character. All the performances are top notch, but that's not my point. I couldn't identify with Ray Liotta. I can understand how his character was seduced my the mob lifestyle, but as an adult he's no better than anyone else around him. In the Godfather, within the encapsulated mob-world with its own set of peculiar rules, the Corleones were actually good people. They respected their wives, they only killed when necessary for business, and their loyalty never wavered. It was easy for me, the audience member, to become entranced and actually cheer them on. In Goodfellas, on the other hand, all the men are essentially a--holes. De Niro is crazy and paranoid, Pesci is insecure and sadistic, and Ray Liotta may have charm, but he has no ethical compulsions (even by mob standards) and will try to get away with whatever he can. I bring all this up because I need to have a character I can care about. The tragic fall of Henry is only tragic if I cared about him to begin with.Secondly, I would have liked a more tangable plot. I don't mean a cookie cutter Hollywood plot, but at least give me something in the first act that gets resolved in the third. The movie plays like a series of unconnected vignettes about mob life. Yes, it's a fascinating glimpse inside the mob, but by 1990 or 91, (whenever this came out) we've already had plenty of fascinating glimpses inside the mob.

Better Goodfellas than this guy back at school who once told me that Mel Gibson's Man Without a Face was his favorite movie.

","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"26 February 2001","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Cabaret is a somewhat curious film that won eight Oscars in 1972 and almost blindsided The Godfather for the best picture of the year. The film is about a young American dancer (Oscar-winner Liza Minnelli) working in an adult nightclub in 1931 Berlin. She is very sexually active and has had many loveless relationships with many men. Two new men in her life catch her eye (Michael York and Helmut Griem). What follows is one of the strangest love stories during the history of the cinema. Minnelli is an expert in sex, York is a bi-sexual, and Griem has characteristics of both Minnelli and York. There are suggestions of three-ways and homosexual undertones throughout the course of the film. Unfortunately none of this adds to the film. The fact that the Nazis are slowly coming to power in Berlin is an important side-story that is never explored as much as it should be. Bob Fosse's (Oscar-winning) direction is pretty good, but the musical numbers at the Kit Kat Klub never do add to the film the way they should. The under-achieving screenplay does nothing to help out this problem either. Joel Grey (Oscar-winning) tries to provide musical insight as the master of ceremonies at the club, but instead of adding to the film he quickly becomes a huge minus. Cabaret is very well-made, but there are some problems that keep the film from being as good as it should have been. The musical scenes are disappointing as they make the film overly wrong and never do create the impact that they were meant to have. Liza Minnelli is the film's greatest asset. She turns a character that could have been very flat into a person who is very complicated and difficult to figure out. Michael York is also impressive as a deep character who, like Minnelli, is in limbo in a place that is slowly spinning out of control. Helmut Griem is not very good though. He struggles through the middle of the film and he never does keep up the intensity created by Minnelli and York. Joel Grey won a curious Oscar as he did not have one speaking line that was not in song. His character is poorly developed and never does have the impact that he was meant to have. Cabaret wanted to be trail-blazing, but basically does the same thing that earlier films from the 1960s did. The Sound of Music is a better musical dealing with the fear generated from the Nazis and Midnight Cowboy is a better film that deals with the taboo subjects of bi- and homosexuality. Cabaret is a good film, but it is no Godfather and the fact that it won eight Oscars is one of those mysteries generated by the Academy. 4 stars out of 5.
