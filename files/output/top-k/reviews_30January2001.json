You heard wrong. The Amityville Horror actually starts off pretty good, with a fairly well done murder scene at the famous house with eyes. However, this is probably the scene (perfectly placed right at the beginning) that put so many people off, particularly the critics. I think that this is a film meant for a younger audience, because most people with families of their own are likely to be disgusted by the carnage that is presented in the opening moments of this movie. This effectively disturbing murder scene is soon followed by a scene where the prospective tenants (some time later) are given a tour of the house by the real estate lady, which makes for a good and well placed way to show the audience around the increasingly creepy house. On the other hand, this was evidently also taken as another opportunity to offend the more mature audience by editing some grisly scenes from the brutal murders into the tour, although it was a fairly effective technique.(spoilers) Once the family has moved in, the strange events begin almost immediately. When the priest, a friend of the family, comes over, he walks into the house, not knowing that the whole family is outside. As he calls out to see if anyone is home, he hears children laughing upstairs. The audience knows that everyone is outside, and this is probably one of the more chilling moments of the film. Why are the ghosts of children so much more unnerving than those of adults? I can never figure that out exactly, but it gets me every time. This was one of the things that made for the scariest moments in countless other films, such as the more recent Blair Witch Project.Unfortunately, after that scene with the children's voices, the film seems to go precipitously downhill, and the ending is the nearly audible crash landing. There are so many cliched scares that were thrown randomly into this film with no forethought that they nearly ruined the entire movie single-handedly. You have the Waking Up Screaming scare, you have the inexplicable Screeching Cat scare, the slamming doors, the mysteriously locked windows and doors, the bumps in the night, the cold rooms, the empty rocking chair, the constantly sweaty father, the list goes on and on. And the things that were actually original made little to no sense at all. For example, we never get any explanation for why that one room upstairs is occasionally filled with hundreds and hundreds of flies. Are we to assume that the rotting corpses of the murdered family are somehow returning to the house? At one point, the toilets in the house spout some sort of tar-like substance, which is also never explained. In another scene, it seems that the house steals $1500 from the oldest son, which he had planned to use to pay the caterer at his wedding (that better have been a damn good caterer). Was this a crime of profit? Committed by the evil house?! Then we have the one scene where the house viciously yells at the priest to Get Out! This wouldn't have been so ineffective had it not been such a completely isolated event. And what exactly was that thing that George, the sweaty father, saw in the upstairs window near the end of the film, some kind of gigantic ghost-pig with glowing eyes? Was that thing supposed to have been superimposed into a different film, and got into The Amityville Horror by accident?I admit that most of this stuff can just fit into the category of the house itself, which is clearly alive in some way, trying everything possible to scare the people away. But on the other hand, why does it want some people gone and others to stay? It tells the priest to get out, but then burns his hand and cuts the connection when he tries to call and warn the family about what happened while he was there. Maybe it wanted George there, because he looks exactly like the guy who killed his family in the house in the opening of the film. Or maybe that similar resemblance is just the first of many ideas that were taken directly from The Shining. The Amityville Horror is strikingly similar in many ways (including the vast majority of the storyline) to The Shining, which leads me to suspect some sort of plagiarism. Kind of makes you wonder... And not only that, but most if not all of the sound effects during scary scenes seem to have been taken directly from the Psycho soundtrack.The impression that The Amityville Horror gives is that of a movie that presents a good story that appears to have been taken from someone else and badly presented in a slightly altered form. Some scenes were unnecessary at best, if not completely exploitative. Did we really need to see the nun loudly vomiting in the middle of the road? George is made to look like some sort of mountain man with no time to respect helmet laws, the guy looks like a freakin' grizzly bear. Who cares that he nearly axed his wife to death in a fit of temporary insanity, he went back and heroically saved the dog at the end, so he's a good guy again, right? That's crap. And how about that ending? Was the script-writer hit by a truck? They may as well have just said They got away. I'll admit that The Amityville Horror is not an utter failure. There were a few scenes (emphasis on few) that actually delivered chills, but unless you are absolutely determined to see this movie, you may be best advised to watch The Shining instead.

Ang Lee continues his tradition of beautiful shots. While some people complain about the pacing, as you can see in many other movies, slow pacing is used to build atmosphere and tension. From a western perspective, yes, I also found the movie a bit slow in parts (the whole desert seduction just kept going and going and going,) but from a filmmaking perspective, it is a great achievement.From a cultural perspective, I found the dialogue incredibly bad, not so much for what was written or the character's motivations for saying what they did, but the delivery. Perhaps in China, you can deliver a dramatic line with no pacing or pauses, but in the west it sounds a lot duller.As a kung fu film fan, I was most disappointed with the quality of the fight scenes. Perhaps, Lee looked for the best actors, not necessarialy the best fighters.Also, I am not a big fan of wire-fights. If you watch any of Jackie Chan's movies, or Jet Li's classic Fist of Legend, you get a true sense of superhumanity, and any wire fights afterwards pale in comparision. (One such incredible actor who will no doubt become a household name in a few years, James Dean Bradley, the white guy in Jackie Chan's woefully underrated and barely released in the US Gorgeous, is one amazing example.All that being said, I would wholeheartedly recommend seeing this movie, because the story is so strong. Every character has 2 or three different and competing motivations for every single decision they must make, and the decisions they actually make make their character really come alive with complexity and emotion.If I would compare this movie to another, it would be John Woo's Last Hurrah for Chivalry. Again, there is a strong story, lots of wire fighting, and good cinematography.In summary, if you are looking for good fighting, you can wait for the video to see this movie. If you are looking for a good time, then go see it on the big screen.

Ang Lee continues his tradition of beautiful shots. While some people complain about the pacing, as you can see in many other movies, slow pacing is used to build atmosphere and tension. From a western perspective, yes, I also found the movie a bit slow in parts (the whole desert seduction just kept going and going and going,) but from a filmmaking perspective, it is a great achievement.From a cultural perspective, I found the dialogue incredibly bad, not so much for what was written or the character's motivations for saying what they did, but the delivery.

Yes, this is your typical teen slasher film, but the plot was kind of different. I liked *almost* everything about it.As I said, the plot and story circling around...urban legends was a different sort of dive from the other teen (horror) films. The writing wasn't terrific, wasn't awful. In fact, it was pretty enjoyable. The casting was all backwards. (I'll explain that in a minute.) The different murder scenes were a little off balance, and most of them I had a problem with.The opening scene with Michelle was interesting. I liked it for some reason and thought that the rest of the film would continue a good stream of killings. I don't sit there waiting for another character to be killed off but having everyone die the same death gets a little boring.~*Spoiler if you don't know who the killer is. I don't know why you wouldn't but I thought that I would announce this.~*The casting must have been done in about ten minutes. While I did enjoy the film overall, I did not enjoy the actors that were chosen to play the parts of a couple of college students. The cast could pass as college kids. I'll give them that much. The main part which I would consider Natalie, was played by a very funny actress. Not funny like ha ha, but funny because she definitely could not play the part as a poor little girl being chased by a killer. Most of the scenes that she was in where she tried to be serious, I couldn't help but laugh. Rebecca Gayheart's character, Brenda, was a little confusing. Here you have a girl that runs around like a princess but when it comes down to doing the dirty work, she seems to have no problem. I thought that it was very hard to buy that Gayheart's character could actually be the psycho who kills off a good amount of people. Jared Leto was okay but why was he listed at the top of the credits? He had a very small part. For the screen time that he was given, I could handle his character of Paul. The 'pretty boy' might want to stay away from so called horror films. The other main actors such as Michael Rosenbaum, Tara Reid and Joshua Jackson were pretty good as opposed to..say Alicia Witt. Rosenbaum had a very minor role but he probably did the best. He took what little he had and made it good to watch. Reid doesn't strike me as the radio host\/whatever else she intended to be. I just want to note that her death was so over done. And Jackson who is always enjoyable to watch continued to add some funny lines, but again his death was ridiculously unbelievable. Anyone else who I overlooked must not have been that good if I can't even remember them. Cast partly well done, partly hilarious for trying to capture the roles that the actors could obviously not accomplish.While 'Urban Legend' had its share of good scenes, there was a number of bad things. One of them was the killer. Now we all now that it was the innocent looking little Brenda. Am I really supposed to believe that a girl like that was able to kill how many people, half if not more being guys who were easily twice her size? That part was a little too unrealistic but I'll try to accept it. The other thing was the murder\/death scenes. Most of them were too drawn out. They tried to make a huge something out of something that wasn't even there. Most and probably the majority of the viewers of this movie found it as just another film with a group of youngsters who try to carry out the name of 'teen horrors.' I too had some problems with it but I would watch it again.

Great cinema is about drama, and this is not a documentary, nor will the audience be disappointed by what they see.  Gladiator gives the audience what it wants the human connection.  History is not flat, lying on a page.  It was real, as real as today is now, and in Gladiator, history is alive, visually compelling... transporting.  What higher compliment could we give than that so many people have been able to instantly identify with a time and place that most of those watching this film have never given much thought to before?  How can this in itself not be called a triumph?  And I would even argue that the writers of these historical epics *must* truncate and rearrange so many aspects of one historical era to reproduce the whole for our understanding... thus aspects of the equally despotic Roman emperors Caligula and Nero are merged with the character of Commodus... but Gladiator is not merely a visual success, or that merely because of its fantastic special effects.  It is quite simply a compelling story.   We all support Maximus in his fight to avenge the murders of his wife and son.  We all love to watch the strangely intriguing performance of the ambitious, luminously mad emperor Commodus... and the delicate maneuvering of his politically-minded sister, Lucilla!  The acting in Gladiator is also reason enough to see the film.  Not only have we the last performance of the great Shakespearean actor Oliver Reed playing Promximo, and the incomparable Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, but two new luminaries on the cinematic horizon Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix.   If great acting can be accomplished with the simple movement of the eyes, if great acting, as has often been said, can be achieved with and within the subtlety of a single expression, then these two have mastered the art of great acting!  A telling point would be to see the film dubbed into Italian (close to Roman Latin); this would prove, I think, how talented these actors are in the expressiveness of their emotions through the eyes and body language, as well as through their fantastic speaking voices.  As for Connie Nielsen, I have to say that she was excellently cast as the elegant Lucilla; had Ridley Scott substituted her for any other more well-known but less capable Hollywood actress, I think the role would have been the film's greatest weakness.  In fact, it was a wise choice to cast this film with extremely talented but less well-known actors (though NOT ANY MORE!), or else Gladiator may not have seemed so realistic, nor made so powerful an impact on so many.

This movie does it perfectly and, most important, is not pretentious enough to give answers and teach people what to do about it. Many questions whose answers are left to the viewer arise through this film. Is Tyler Durden really crazy? Was the fight club just a product of the narrator's increasing paranoia or rather a cure to his frustrations (or both?). Were the people in project Mayhem finding their real ego or were they just followers? Is the world we see really what we think it is, and are we actually who we think we are? Is it possible to change the world, and how far can we go to change it?Paid critics trashed this movie. Those reviews - some of which were so empty they were laughable - were exactly part of the system this movie wants to criticize, and therefore came out like actual glorification.

I'm a brand new addition to the Lord of the Rings circle, as I just finished reading the trilogy this past weekend - can you believe it, 23, and never read the books 'til now? So Tolkien drew me in and made me want more, so I've been frantically searching for additional material; I'd heard about this film, and was told to see it once, even though it was bad. So I rented it... and my feelings are ambivalent.I'm incredibly impressed with the script. Some Tolkien purists may take issue with not including every single page, but I've had many favorite books translated to the screen, and not one has been this true to the original text, save maybe The Last Unicorn - ironically, by Peter S. Beagle, who translated this into script form as well. (Every Tom Clancy book I've read has been hacked apart to make its corresponding movie.) You can't include every syllable of a four hundred page novel into a script (or in this case, two novels) so look to include what's most important. These people did an impressive job at staying true to the spirit of the books while cutting out the lesser parts so it had a decent running time.That said, I am none too happy with the visuals. How can anyone take such an impressive script and then make it into something like this film? As a graduate with a production degree and an interest in animation, I look critically at works like this, and I've never seen such a chop job. The animation itself was too focused on simulating live action by making exaggerated facial expressions, hand gestures and sweeps of body movement; I've never thought it possible to make an animated character drastically overact before, but this film accomplished it with more than one character (particularly Gandalf). I prefer the Rankin\/Bass version of Return of the King in its actual visual representation of the characters (though, ironically, I prefer the storyline of this one, the R\/B version has *way* too many songs in it), but that's all subjective, because no movie will please all viewers on how specific characters look. The behind-the-screen live action at the very beginning of the film looked like a one-shot take; all the acting was flat and listless. The rotoscoping was extremely distracting throughout most of the film, especially when animation and rotoscope came together. It proves that you've got to decide just animate it all or make it live action.I was most irritated with where the production ended, though I've heard it's because they ran out of money (query then why put out an unfinished product?). The script was so promising I was willing to forgive the visuals just to see where the end was taken, but I got cut off somewhere near where the second book, The Two Towers, finishes, with a sloppy attempt to make the Battle of Helm's Deep the end of the film.

It's not as bad as I heard it was - well, at least the script wasn't. If I have one wish for the trilogy currently in production, it's that they do as true of an adaption for the script.

Persuading people who already have three kids to have another one?  Let's make like they're doughnuts, and have a dozen, says Steve Martin sarcastically - but Martin and fellow comic Rick Moranis are in the unfortunate position of being trapped in a movie in which nobody, not even the director, takes any notice of them when they're saying something that runs counter to the message they were hired to preach.  Moranis and Martin are voices of sanity, and the most sympathetic people present.  But the script keeps betraying them.Moranis plays Nathan Merrick, a father who wants his daughter to be an only child for at least five years - because this increases her chances of being intelligent and capable, and may even help her become a genius.  His wife is opposed to this plan.  Why?  Because, she snaps, their daughter is not some PRODUCT!  -Okay, cheap retorts aside, why is she opposed to this plan?  Because she wants another child, NOW.  Since the film is set in some weird kind of Catholic universe, in which any kind of procreative restraint is a sin, she gets her way.There's a scene that's meant to be amusing - to be fair, it IS amusing - in which Nathan is teaching his daughter the names of the elements while Mozart is being played in the background.  -Well, why not?  Mozart himself was a child prodigy who grew up on a healthy diet of Haydn; so was Beethoven.  Anyone born today with the capacity to become as great would choke on The Wiggles, or some such.  Active steps are needed to prevent this.  Good on Nathan, I say.But this is a side issue.  The film's central goal is to persuade us - you, me, and everyone else - to go forth and multiply.  Pay no attention to the fact most of the film's running time is devoted to the down side of procreating.  It never looks at this down side very closely; and anyway, it's all a cunning ploy.  At the end, everyone has a spanking new baby, and they all look so HAPPY.  (Even an uncoupled widower who's ancestor to over half the cast already and who may even be old enough to be infertile finds himself saddled with a fresh kid.  What hope is there for the rest of us?)It's the roller coaster story that does it.  Don't ask about the roller coaster story.  I can't bring myself to repeat it.  A minute ago I was so CONFUSED about life.  Then Grandma came along with her roller coaster story, and now, everything's okay!  When Steve Martin says this he's being sarcastic, but the sarcasm is only Ron Howard's way of disguising the fact that this really is what we're meant to think.  (Steve Martin is, as usual, funny, but on the whole he needed better jokes.  It's a shame.  Martin the performer is talented in at least three ways he can act, he can be hilarious, and he can save weak material when nobody else in the world can.  We've seen him at work on that third thing too often.)Ron Howard is far from being a great director, but when he made Parenthood he was clearly at his best.  A pity he chose that moment, of all moments, to preach.  And the sermon he chose could hardly have been more ill-judged.P.S.  The title really ought to have been Fatherhood.  Even the one female-heavy plot strand (he Lampkins saga) was as much concerned with fathers as with mothers.  Not that I'm complaining - the film is over two hours long as it is.  If, for every father, there had been an equally prominent mother ... well, let's just be grateful that there isn't.

But the script keeps betraying them.Moranis plays Nathan Merrick, a father who wants his daughter to be an only child for at least five years - because this increases her chances of being intelligent and capable, and may even help her become a genius.  His wife is opposed to this plan.  Why?  Because, she snaps, their daughter is not some PRODUCT!  -Okay, cheap retorts aside, why is she opposed to this plan?  Because she wants another child, NOW.  Since the film is set in some weird kind of Catholic universe, in which any kind of procreative restraint is a sin, she gets her way.There's a scene that's meant to be amusing - to be fair, it IS amusing - in which Nathan is teaching his daughter the names of the elements while Mozart is being played in the background.  -Well, why not?  Mozart himself was a child prodigy who grew up on a healthy diet of Haydn; so was Beethoven.  Anyone born today with the capacity to become as great would choke on The Wiggles, or some such.  Active steps are needed to prevent this.  Good on Nathan, I say.But this is a side issue.  The film's central goal is to persuade us - you, me, and everyone else - to go forth and multiply.  Pay no attention to the fact most of the film's running time is devoted to the down side of procreating.  It never looks at this down side very closely; and anyway, it's all a cunning ploy.  At the end, everyone has a spanking new baby, and they all look so HAPPY.  (Even an uncoupled widower who's ancestor to over half the cast already and who may even be old enough to be infertile finds himself saddled with a fresh kid.  What hope is there for the rest of us?)It's the roller coaster story that does it.  Don't ask about the roller coaster story.  I can't bring myself to repeat it.  A minute ago I was so CONFUSED about life.  Then Grandma came along with her roller coaster story, and now, everything's okay!  When Steve Martin says this he's being sarcastic, but the sarcasm is only Ron Howard's way of disguising the fact that this really is what we're meant to think.  (Steve Martin is, as usual, funny, but on the whole he needed better jokes.  It's a shame.  Martin the performer is talented in at least three ways he can act, he can be hilarious, and he can save weak material when nobody else in the world can.  We've seen him at work on that third thing too often.)Ron Howard is far from being a great director, but when he made Parenthood he was clearly at his best.  A pity he chose that moment, of all moments, to preach.  And the sermon he chose could hardly have been more ill-judged.P.S.  The title really ought to have been Fatherhood.  Even the one female-heavy plot strand (he Lampkins saga) was as much concerned with fathers as with mothers.  Not that I'm complaining - the film is over two hours long as it is.  If, for every father, there had been an equally prominent mother ... well, let's just be grateful that there isn't.

Benicio Del Toro has this presence about him that radiates coolness, and Ryan Phillippe did a remarkable job as well with his role. There were scenes in which hardly any dialogue was spoken, yet whole paragraphs were spoken through facial expressions. Thats a testament to the abilities of the actors right there. The double meaning of the game of hearts explanation was fascinating and fun to decipher.Plots twists galore, not a single one of them predictable. The terminology was all new to me (i.e. bagman\/dejudication I think it was...) and it made me feel like I was actually participating in the movie.This is a thinkers movie, and some people may not be in the mood for that.

He is willing to put himself on the line with this movie, which will be glossed over by countless reviewers and even movie buffs as something derivative or even a played out crime movie. There will be the mindless comparisons to Tarantino, Peckinpah, maybe even a Tony Scott here and there, but I'd like to think that if you really watched the movie, you can evaluate it in it's own right, as it's own creative statement and work of art. Now I'm a fan, my take on the film is that it's brilliant. MY pick for the best movie of 2000. It's expressly because it's a basic crime movie that I feel this way. There are over a hundred movies in this genre released every year. Most debut on video or late night cable and are never heard from again. Some manage to get A-list stars and Joel Silver or Jerry Bruckheimer to produce them and wind up with $20 million dollar openings. And some, like this one, feature movie actors, acting out brilliant scenes and dialogue, in front of a great director (as I'm sure he will prove to be).  And the fact that he made this type of movie, but in a fresh, creative, even intelligent way, is what makes him so good. In a few years people are gonna go see Alexander the Great or whatever else McQuarrie does and then hear about this and go back to their video store and rent this puppy and it will probably have the same resurgence Reservoir Dogs did after Pulp Fiction came out. It's a shame just because a movie isn't as slick and Hollywood as Con-Air or Lethal Weapon it's either a straight to cable offering, or, if it's good, a Tarantino rip-off. I think we need a few more categories. Sorry about the manifesto, but I'm a bit riled at how poorly this movie was received. Either I'm seeing something in it that isn't there, or a whole lot of people are really missing something. The writer-director phenomenon is just getting bigger and bigger all the time, which I think is a good thing. Especially if it breeds more like Christopher McQuarrie. All I can say is, watch this movie like you'd watch something important, pay attention and soak in all that it has to offer. I doubt you'd be disappointed.
