After 28 years, as far as horror movies go, I feel only John Carpenter's The Thing has even approached the elegance of this Gothic masterpiece.When a scientist uses the word elegant, they usually mean in the most complimentary way possible that something is as complete and as simple as possible. That's what I mean here while no detail appears to be overlooked, no attempt at adding more was made. True, this followed from the Star Wars look of the lived in future .... but there is a noirish grittiness that was not seen before in science fiction (and would be taken maybe even more extreme when Scott did Blade Runner a few years later. This film drips with darkness and despair in much the same way that the early scenes of the original Dracula did. As a fan of Star Trek which showed the world of tomorrow as hopeful, this was the anti-Star Trek we're all screwed, you can't trust anyone, and the universe does have real monsters out there.Another amazing thing to me is that after all this time, it is not dated. Sure, there are little things that will key you into its late 1970s origins, but they are for the most part small and easy to overlook.This is one of the few films that I will watch about twice a year, and yet I never really get sick of it. Only in recent years have I finally gotten the nerve to watch it alone at night with the lights out. For people who have never seen this, and are not used to horror get warmed up first. If you call yourself a horror fan, you are not a fan until you have seen this film.

You don't watch a movie - you experience a real time and place. I happen to love a bunch of Paul Newman's films (The 3 H's - Hud, Hombre and Harper; Cool Hand Luke; The Sting; The Hustler; The Color of Money...), but I'm not what you'd call a rabid fan. I think he is compelling, but has a fairly limited range. He is perfect in this role, but it isn't much different from The Hustler or Cool Hand Luke. However, watching Melvyn Douglas is like watching somebody that Marty Ritt pulled off of some ranch and filmed in his daily life. His performance is absolutely dead- on. The gravelly drawl, the old boy shuffle, his expression - the way his eyes take in the landscape or gaze intently into a bowl of ice cream while Hud talks - all incredibly REAL! I KNOW those old guys!Melvyn Douglas is a truly under-appreciated American acting genius whose career spanned over 5 decades. His range is tremendous. This is the same honey-tongued actor who is the perfect comic foil to Garbo's Ninotchka in the '30's (In fact, he is one of her only REPEAT leading men!) And his bluster-filled performance in I Never Sang for My Father (with another modern great, Gene Hackman) is also out of this world! Other commentators have addressed Hud's multi-faceted story and the incredible B&W cinematography. All wonderful - but the next time you watch this true American classic, focus on Douglas' Oscar-winning performance. You will be amazed! (And remind yourself of some of the early roles in romantic comedies - Ninotchka, That Uncertain Feeling, This Thing Called Love or Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House - this same actor performed so well.)
