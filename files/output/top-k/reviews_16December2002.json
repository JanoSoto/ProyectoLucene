At first, I was reluctant to see this movie because I was trying to grow up, and I thought that it was for kids- even though adults thought that it was great. However, I finally did see it, and WOW! was I shocked! It was excellent! Funny, interesting, and great songs all make this movie one of the best that I have ever seen. The actors who did the voices were great, the animation was also great, and I will mention the songs- well chosen. I especially loved the karaoke at the end. I've seen it three times and am still not bored of it. If you're planning to see it, well, do so and get it!

Wrong story line and wrong director for a story about the Windtalkers.  It was not about the Navajos, but about the psychological effects of war on Nicolas Cage, who walks through the scenes giving us less than his usual fine performances.  Adam Beach, who plays Sam Yahzee, on the other hand is very good.  Woo is a great action director, but every scene of 25-30 Japanese soldiers being killed was just like the previous one.  The practically bloodless Sands of Iwo Jima is a better film.  The credits at the end of the film listed 104 stuntment; and surpisingly the official assistance of the U.S. Marine Corps. With a better story, Ridley Scott, Blackhawk Down director, could have presented a film worthy of the Navajo marines who played such an important role in the South Pacific during World War II.
