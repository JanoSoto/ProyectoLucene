She admits that she hates `knowing more than anyone else' on any subject, but she can't help herself.  Her Jane Craig is like a ball of energy attracting or repelling others who come within range.  She holds herself and everyone around her to a standard that is almost impossible to achieve and it is exhausting.  She could never be an on-air personality. Jane has to be behind the scenes, controlling everything.It makes perfect sense that her best friend is the acerbic Aaron (Albert Brooks).  He has everything going for him except charisma.  And knowing that he is never going to go any further in his career because he isn't pretty enough has embittered him.  Personally, I think he should have worked in print journalism where he could have been a star.  (In 1987, when this movie was made, it was rare to see someone who didn't look like a department store dummy on the local news.)The third leg in this triangle is William Hurt's Tom.  He has nothing going for him except charisma.  Hurt does very well with a difficult acting challenge, namely playing someone who is just a little bit dim.  He is always a step behind and he knows it.  It even shows in his eyes.  Yet for me his is the least compelling character because I don't think Hurt is gorgeous, I find his looks bland.  So there is no reason for Jane and Jennifer (Lois Chiles) to be so interested in him.The ending works for me.  There was no way for either romance to work. Tom will never understand Jane's professional ethics (where faking the news IS a serious offense) and that would have broken them up eventually.  And she and Aaron are past the point where they could become romantically involved. But, despite spending seven years as the head of the Washington bureau of a major network, she has learned to loosen up a bit and even has a romantic relationship that is working.Jack Nicholson's part is really a cameo, a `thank you' to James L. Brooks who wrote and directed `Terms of Endearment' which won Nicholson his second Oscar.The choice of Tom vs. Aaron echoes the theme of this movie.  It is style vs. substance and how, in today's society we have begun to mistake the former for the later.  The theme is perfectly summed up in Aaron's `Tom is the devil' speech . . .  `How about that.  I buried the lead.'Score 9 out of 10.

Generally, highly popular, sci-fi\/adventure, movies are not thought of as great, but this is definitely an exception. Why is that? It's the script, IMO. I have yet to see such a brilliant and clever script since. Examples are Marty's mom berating the behavior she herself was guilty of as a teenager; Marty creating a makeshift skateboard, which he is shown to be very adept at riding in the present, out of an old time scooter in 1955; George Mcfly punching out Biff turns George into a confident, successful writer and Biff into a stumbling oaf; and, of course, Marty inventing rock n roll. Every story writer\/screenwriter should really study this script to see how the great ones are constructed.    Another reason this movie is so good is that the casting is as good as it can be. I really can't imagine any other actors in those roles.    Beyond that, the movie is just so much fun to watch - it's one of those movies I've seen a hundred times and still watch if it comes on TV.

Jackie is excellent and funny, with enough new moves to make it different from his other movies. Owen Wilson plays the smart-alecky know-it-all cowboy, but he's really just knowledgeable enough to be dangerous. He's not exceptionally good or bad at anything really (except for shooting!!), and it's actually a nice, workable change from movies that have heroes that never miss or get shot 500 times and keep going. The comedy moves right along, with several semi-intellectual comical scenes that make me appreciate comedy that's more than just silly, slapstick goofiness for the sake of a laugh (although, fortunately, there's plenty of that,too). All in all, these guys are as funny together as Jackie was with Chris Tucker in the Rush Hour series.
