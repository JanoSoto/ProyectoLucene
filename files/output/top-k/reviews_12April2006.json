Algiers follows its French model in ways that it's just not a remake, it's a copy of the other film.Fortunately for John Cromwell, a fine director, he got a tremendously appealing performance by Charles Boyer, a suave actor who embodied the famous jewel thief of that notorious district of Algiers. This film was also made better thanks to the magic camera work by James Wong Howe, one of the best men in the business, as proved by his long and distinguished career behind the scenes. Henri LaBarthe's novel was adapted for this American version by John Howard Lawson, with James Cain's helping with additional dialog.Algiers is not without its own merits. Thanks to the talented cast that came together for the making of this film, it has gained the status of a classic. Charles Boyer was perfect as Pepe, a man whose life centers around the mysterious citadel where all kinds of unsavory characters live. Hedy Lamarr, one of the most beautiful faces in the movies, makes a good appearance as Gaby, the woman who steals Pepe's heart. Gaby and Pepe have a common ground as they reminisce of Paris, a city both love.The other triumph of Algiers was the way the supporting players made this story much better, as it seems impossible to visualize other people cast for the key minor parts. Sigrid Gurie, is a mysterious Ines, the woman in love with Pepe. In her love, she doesn't stop to take into consideration what her actions will do to her lover. Gene Lockhart, a magnificent character actor, is phenomenal in his take of Regis, the schemer of the Casbah. Joseph Calleia, is perfectly sly as Inspector Slimane, a man with the patience of a saint, who must humor Pepe and his gang and who is powerless inside the Casbah. Stanley Fields makes a loyal Carlos, Pepe's trusted companion. Johnny Downs is seen as Pierrot and Leonid Kinskey, another character actor who worked extensively in that period of the American cinema, is excellent as L'arbi.For those who haven't seen the original Duvivier film, try getting the wonderful DVD to see the great Jean Gabin in one of his best roles. The copy shown by TCM recently, seemed somewhat faded. We don't know if it has been remastered yet, but obviously, James Wong Howe's work ought to be seen in all its magnificence.

This is an occasionally amusing but generally uninspired and sometimes even dreary film. Its main downfall is that Brooks (as both actor, writer and director), has nothing new to say, and is still relying on the same stale old persona and situations that he used much more effectively back in 1985.There are some saving graces in the film Sharon Stone is excellent in a tricky role, she avoids the easy trap of playing her role for laughs and in light of the revelation about her character at the end, her performance rings true.And the ending - where we learn that Stone isn't a muse but actually a person with mental issues who has been based in a sanitoraium - is an apt comment on the gullibility of Hollywood types who are so distanced from reality that they would actually seriously believe she was a muse. Jeff Bridges is also fine in his small role.Having said that, up until that revelation this is a very toothless satire on Hollywood. Brooks' character is also hard to take. He's doing his usual whiny persona but there's nothing in this film to suggest he has anything to whine about.Also, Andie McDowell fails to make much of an impression with her character. She's not helped by the relationship between her and Brooks being weakly written and not adding up to much.Probably most disappointing is how weak it is as a comedy. As an earlier reviewer noted, the scene where Brooks (as a punchline) ends up with a Waldorf salad all over his face is a very lazy and sitcomish moment that one expected Brooks had the talent to avoid. Another sign that the passion and purpose is ebbing away in his work.Another weak comic moment is towards the end where the Doctor and Nurse visibly crack up when they learn Brooks\/MacDowell seriously believed that Stone was a muse. It's another lazy, unrealistic 'sitcom' attempt at humour - it's just not believable that a doctor would behave in such a manner.

Heaven knows what she's doing in this typically confused confection helmed by veteran hack director Richard Donner but she's a godsend to the movie as a female shyster of dubious reputation, complete with batty eyes and dodgy southern accent ('most gentlemen enjoy my Southern'). There's absolutely no doubt Foster is a terrific actress. Oscars for 'The Accused' and 'The Silence Of The Lambs' as well as grounded performances in genre pieces such as 'Panic Room' are sufficient testimony to that fact. But we rarely see her doing comedy and, on the basis of this performance, she should lighten up more often. As with her dramatic performances, she has great instinct and fantastic timing. With more than a hint of Irene Dunne (another superb comedienne), it's a great pity she's not paired with someone who has better comic abilities than Mel Gibson. This movie has the dubious honour of containing one of Gibson's worst performances. He's much better in dramatic roles ('Year Of Living Dangerously', 'Gallipoli') where he can't show off rather than the action-comedies that he seems to prefer. Unfortunately, he just can't resist these buddy pictures and the cronyism is complete with Richard Donner on board who panders to Gibson's worst instincts. Gibson mugs and apes his way through this and there's no one behind the camera trying to tone him down.Donner is clueless. He seems to think that simply populating the cast with recognisable faces from other similar western TV series is inherently funny. Proof of his lack of subtlety is Danny Glover's embarrassing and completely unnecessary cameo. Double-take, followed by triple-take - apart from being totally humourless, I'm surprised we weren't treated to flashing subtitles saying 'hey look, it's Danny Glover!'. Luckily Gibson's scenes with Foster have a certain amount of frisson to them (as if Gibson momentarily seems to understand that he's dealing with a professional). Also, on the positive side, James Garner (the original Brett Maverick, fact fans) manages to get through it all without embarrassing himself (although he has one or two dodgy moments).This is an undemanding enough waste-of-time if you can stomach Mel Gibson at his worst and a Director about whom David Thomson memorably said 'Mr. Donner has made several of the most successful and least interesting films of his age.

I had been looking forward to the experience since i played a certain computer game with a similar plot some years back. There was something exotic and fascinating with the thought of a very unlikely Soviet invasion of the USA. Disappointingly, what I saw was pretty trashy.In the movie, America has been deserted by many former allied because of an extremely unlikely dissolvement of NATO (except of the UK, of course). As if that wasn't enough, Mexico has underwent a Revolution to become a Marxist state. In 1984, the Soviets got unlucky with their harvest, which leads to the invasion of the US. Naturally. According to an Air Force officer the heroes in the movie encounter later, they smuggled in special troops (Spetsnaz) using charter planes, to secure key strategic points. He adds 'the same way they did in Afghanistan'. Interestingly, that's the first time I've heard of charter routes to that specific country. Spies had somehow crippled the American ability to defend and retaliate, and a lot of horrifying commies from Latin America swarmed across the border. The Soviets showed up with massive armies, who were somewhat stopped by the armed defenders. Is there still hope? Of course! Because 1 The American youth are professional guerrilla warriors, and 2 The Soviets don't have a clue how to occupy a country (as seen in Afghanistan). The youth call themselves 'The Wolverines', and kill LOADS of occupants using captured equipment.The script is maybe the most disturbing aspect of this film It has dumb clichés, witless dialog, and is far, far from being intellectual\/contemplative. On the question of how it felt to kill a foe, a youth who had lost his parents answer 'It felt good'. This particular actor was especially horrendous, so that you almost laugh out loud when he says it.The special effects are cheap and uncomfortable to look at, which strengthens the feeling that this is a low-budget film. I hoped for lots of tanks, massive air strikes etc., but the movie contains a minimum of cool combat sequences. The attack choppers late in the movie doesn't even look like the infamous Soviet Hinds, they're just crappy look-a-likes.The acting was bad. Seriously, it was BAD.

I had been looking forward to the experience since i played a certain computer game with a similar plot some years back. There was something exotic and fascinating with the thought of a very unlikely Soviet invasion of the USA. Disappointingly, what I saw was pretty trashy.In the movie, America has been deserted by many former allied because of an extremely unlikely dissolvement of NATO (except of the UK, of course). As if that wasn't enough, Mexico has underwent a Revolution to become a Marxist state. In 1984, the Soviets got unlucky with their harvest, which leads to the invasion of the US. Naturally. According to an Air Force officer the heroes in the movie encounter later, they smuggled in special troops (Spetsnaz) using charter planes, to secure key strategic points. He adds 'the same way they did in Afghanistan'. Interestingly, that's the first time I've heard of charter routes to that specific country. Spies had somehow crippled the American ability to defend and retaliate, and a lot of horrifying commies from Latin America swarmed across the border. The Soviets showed up with massive armies, who were somewhat stopped by the armed defenders. Is there still hope? Of course! Because 1 The American youth are professional guerrilla warriors, and 2 The Soviets don't have a clue how to occupy a country (as seen in Afghanistan). The youth call themselves 'The Wolverines', and kill LOADS of occupants using captured equipment.The script is maybe the most disturbing aspect of this film It has dumb clichés, witless dialog, and is far, far from being intellectual\/contemplative. On the question of how it felt to kill a foe, a youth who had lost his parents answer 'It felt good'. This particular actor was especially horrendous, so that you almost laugh out loud when he says it.The special effects are cheap and uncomfortable to look at, which strengthens the feeling that this is a low-budget film. I hoped for lots of tanks, massive air strikes etc., but the movie contains a minimum of cool combat sequences. The attack choppers late in the movie doesn't even look like the infamous Soviet Hinds, they're just crappy look-a-likes.The acting was bad. Seriously, it was BAD. I understand completely why Patrick Swayze had his breakthrough in a later movie, and not in this one. Charlie Sheen, who plays his brother is awful as well. The supporting cast sometimes seem like a group of randomly selected amateurs. The actors have serious problems displaying their characters. Emotions seem fake.

The best of them all was Beastmaster because it had creative production design, colorful photography and even some ideas of its own. Dar, the Beastmaster (Marc Singer), can see through the eyes of animals and command them whenever he needs help. The evil priest Maax (Rip Torn) holds Dar's father, the king, prisoner as well as the slave girl Kiri (Tanya Roberts) whom Dar fell in love with. In this action-packed movie, we meet a lot of bizarre folks, like the scary batmen who can suck their victims dry if they catch them under their wings (and still these are some of the good guys!) or the berserkers who carry green worms in their brains to drive them crazy. Director\/script writer Coscarelli was also in charge of the very successful horror movie Phantasm, and that shows in the darker scenes. Tanya Roberts looked so good in rags she went on to make Sheena with equally little to wear. Marc Singer's muscles were memorable enough to get him signed many years later for 2 sequels which weren't half as good as the original, but still way better than the politically correct TV series 20 years later. Comparing the 113 minutes director's cut (British DVD) to the old 91 minutes German video tape version, these are the most important scenes previously omitted 1) 8 1\/2 minutes of introduction, in which we learn how Maax was threatened by the king, hears the prophecy about the king's unborn son and asks a witch to abduct the baby (from his mother's womb!). Probably it was felt it takes too long until we see the grown-up hero. The disadvantage is that we know less in the short version about Maax and his motives. 2) Still in the first third of the movie, a funny scene was cut in which Dar falls into quicksand, needs help from the animals - and rescues one of them in return. This scene is a charming illustration of the beginning of his friendship with the animals, but not necessary to understand the story. 3) In the last third of the movie, 3 scenes were cut in which the injured young prince is carried into a house, gets better and receives a gift from the Beastmaster. It seems this was cut as it slows down the movie and gives information about the boy only - who is not one of the main characters, anyway. There are also smaller cuts along the way, sometimes due to violence. Anyhow, go get The Beastmaster in this longer version!

Plan 9 from Outer Space quickly gained a huge cult-following after being named the worst movie ever made and gave its failed director, Edward Wood Jr., the fame and recognition he never could achieve while alive. However, and despite its enormous amount of mistakes, Plan 9 has a bizarre charm that makes it different than other movies it has heart. It is the legacy of a man whose love for films was bigger than his artistic skills, and that could do anything to complete a movie.Plan 9 from Outer Space is, according to its narrator, the Amazing Criswell, the retelling of the fateful day when a group of aliens tried to destroy the planet Earth, by re-animating the dead to destroy the living. An old man (Bela Lugosi) and his wife (Vampira) are the first ghouls re-animated by the aliens in their ninth attempt to destroy the earth.The plot, as weird as it sounds nowadays, was really a variation on the usual sci-fi plot of the days of McCarthyism and the fear of invaders. However, Wood's script is filled with weird dialogs that one can only take as the unedited script. It is obvious that Wood was desperate to make the movie so he shot everything not caring if what he had written sounded good on screen. Despite the poor writing of his films, Wood always tried to put a social commentary on his films, and Plan 9 shows his lack of confidence in the Government and maybe in humanity in general.About the obvious mistakes, some say it was due to low-budget, others state that it was due to his overconfidence; the fact remains that Wood almost never shot a scene twice no matter the results. This terrible mistake become one of Wood's main characteristics through his career, and in Plan 9 is painfully notorious. Every shot seems to be in the movie no matter if the cardboard tombs fell or if an actor makes a mistake; the show must go on and the picture must be finished.The bizarre edition (going from day to night and vice-versa) and the use & abuse of stock footage is another of Wood's characteristics that make this film so special. The performances of Tor Johnson and Vampira, Pual Marco and Dudley Manlove, and the unforgettable Bela Lugosi truly complete the show.Probably Ed Wood's life and the story about the creation of Plan 9 are a better tale than Plan 9 itself; Tim Burton's fictionalized biopic Ed Wood is a good proof of that. However, Plan 9 is a must-see for every fan of cinema, and specially for everyone interested in film-making, as it is the job of a man who had his soul definitely in cinema, but his talent definitely in other place.One could say after reading this huge amount of flaws that Plan 9 is an unwatchable piece of trash, and while maybe they are right; Wood's masterpiece has an enormous charm that makes everything look good. It is a weird feeling the one that Plan 9 conveys, a feeling of tenderness and naiveté that infects the viewer with Wood's spirit and makes the unwatchable being enjoyable, and turns the trash into a classic. That is Plan 9's incredible paradox it is probably the only movie where one can proudly say It is so bad that is good. It is a 5\/10 that tastes like a 10\/10.

The former casts him and Martin Lawrence as 1930s New Yorkers Ray Gibson and Claude Banks, who drive down to Mississippi and get falsely convicted of murder, thereby getting a life sentence in a prison farm. Over the years, they have a series of experiences, sometimes wacky, sometimes revealing new dimensions to their characters. Obviously, the very thought of a movie starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence sounds like it would have to be pure junk. Looking at the poster, one might think that the whole movie consists of them getting bullied by giant inmates (and there are some scenes like that). But this flick actually has a plot. There's obviously the context of the Jim Crow south - which, believe it or not, leads to a really funny situation at one point. All in all, this is a very well done comedy - silly at times, but definitely worth seeing. We can say with certainty that Ted Demme had a very good track record as a director (he was also behind The Ref and Blow); too bad he died so young.*Unfortunately, his last few years have consisted of fare like I Spy and Daddy Day Care.

The relationship between Vincent and Jules is particularly interesting in the way they both are of the same profession and can view events, like the shooting in the kid's apartment, completely different. Also the movie doesn't focus on just on aspect the whole film. I believe that the director realized that a typical mobster movie wasn't going to draw attention so he took a different approach. This concept of multiple stories is revolutionary expetionally in an action film, this is why the movie received much acclaim and why people liked the film so much. The aspect of the film that I liked the most was how you were still able to get an emotional response to a mobster movie, instead of just watching Pulp Fiction for just entertainment, you walked away from the movie feeling different, like you have accoplished something. One of my biggest critiques of the film is, Butch, played by Bruce Willis. You would expect an exceptional performance from Bruce, but I was let down by his menial acting in the movie. In all I liked how the movie flows and it didn't feel like just a waste of time.
