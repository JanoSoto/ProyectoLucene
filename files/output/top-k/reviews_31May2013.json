Like From Dusk Til Dawn, Killing Zoe spends the first half of the movie setting the scene and the rest of the movie with the action. Killing Zoe is a low budget film made in Los Angeles with a few Parisian shots. This is also Avary's first movie and I think he has some talent.Zed (Eric Stolz) has been invited to Paris by an old friend, Eric (Jean-Hughes Anglade) to crack a safe in a bank. Zed is a professional, and we see this as he sets to work opening a safe, yet he is a quiet humble man who prefers to make love than to kill. He is also a man who is easily manipulated and Eric does this quite regularly in the movie. We see Zed being forced into taking drugs and having women dragged away from him because Eric doesn't particularly like them. He is also taken of a tour through a very dark side of Paris where we see drugs, sleazy women, and men screwing like animal (I use such terminology because it is only for the selfish desire of pleasure). The next day, Bastille Day, he then must participate in a daring bank robbery. Daring because everybody is hung over, or still on drugs; it is a high security bank; and it seems very little planning has gone into it.Eric is not the typical Hollywood robber. He kills at a whim and has no preferences to who he will kill. He murders a woman and a man and lets another man go free. In fact Eric seems to have a thing against women as he brutally throws Zoe (Julie Delpy) out of the room when he first meets Zed and throws another whore across the room when she tries to seduce Zed (even though he cannot understand her). He kills people on a whim and represents the worst that humanity can offer.Zoe is another character who begins as a prostitute yet does not want to think of herself as one. She needs to money to get through school and just considers the job as a little thing on the side. Yet she knows what she is, and even though she considers herself beautiful and refined, everybody else treats her as a whore. The reality of what she does hits home when she listens to three men tell a joke about a whore.Killing Zoe is a reasonable movie and good for a low budget production. Much of the movie was spoken in French which is supposed to reflect the fact that it was in France, but this didn't irritate me as it did in Stargate when everybody spoke ancient Egyptian. Still it is a good movie and worth a watch if you can handle drugs and brutal violence.

It is an adventure for Francesca, who considers herself a common Iowan housewife without a liking for change. She is anything but common, as Robert tells her in another scene, otherwise she wouldn't have said those words; Francesca fully knew what she was doing, yet she on her own accord went ahead. How long her relationship could last with Robert didn't matter to her then; what mattered was that she could find pure happiness with this man, a state she hadn't felt in years.This adventure gradually becomes a spiritual journey for the unhappy housewife, gradually unraveling the mysteries of life and love. But the leap to a spiritual journey requires a renunciation from her adventure; otherwise the love shared between Francesca and Robert would culminate in nothing more than a liaison. And so, Bridges of Madison County does away with the pretty Hollywood ending and still, everything does end up well for everybody.A thoughtful message indeed, but what troubles is that Bridges of Madison County is that it often makes us feel as though we're watching a typical lifetime film whose sole intent is to make big moral observations whenever and wherever possible. So the scenes are often plagued with 'that moment when there's momentarily silence after which a character speaks something big' &#x96; it often is found just before a scene ends. And while Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, our Robert and Francesca, do try not to allow this film to slip into a silly melodrama, the clichéd material sometimes becomes overwhelming for the two. The two other actors playing Francesca grown-up children do not help either, almost making it look as though two separate films of different caliber &#x96; the better one with Streep and Eastwood, of course, were spliced together. Bridges of Madison County begins with Francesca's children Caroline and Michael arriving at their recently deceased mother's Iowa home for settlement of her estate. Both the children are married and both are unhappy with their marriages and yet they've neither cheated on their spouses nor have they thought of a divorce. Michael does have a valid reason for being mad at his wife though, because she says the darndest things at the most inappropriate time; just when Michael is handed the keys of Francesca's safety deposit box, she offhandedly jokes that Francesca could've left millions in the box for her children. No, it isn't a Hitchcock story so forget the millions; instead what's found in the box is an old camera, pictures and letters. Caroline begins reading one of the letters and learns that her mother had written a love letter once to a man named Robert. She talks to Michael in private and the two begin reading the letters after asking Michael's wife and the accompanying lawyer to leave. There's a silly line spoken by Caroline when she opens a magazine which has a picture of Robert Kincaid with the name mentioned clearly on the left; she assumes This must be Robert Kincaid even when the names clearly visible to even the audience's eye.Letters reveal that Francesca deliberately kept the items for her children so they may know her secret and not consider her a mad raving woman for requesting in her will to cremate her body and throw the ashes near Roseman Covered Bridge, which Robert used to visit along with Francesca to shoot photographs for National Geographic. At first, both Michael and Caroline are disgusted but as they hear Francesca's story, first through her letters and then through her diaries, they realize how these four days profoundly affected their mother's attitude (positively) towards life, and they slowly begin empathizing with her and introspect on their own outlooks towards life and marriage. Annie Corley and Victor Slezak, playing Caroline and Michael respectively, give stilted and forgettable performances. Slezak especially fails with his 'Chandler' look from Friends that can hardly be taken seriously. They're not completely at fault, as the framing device (kids reading mother's letters with such unwholesome curiosity it feels as though they've been given a copy of Fifty Shades of Gray) is weakly implemented; there's a poorly shot scene when Michael wants to know why his mother didn't leave the family and Caroline and he immediately turn their heads towards their mother's diary and then look at each other. The scene makes you wonder why a great filmmaker like Eastwood couldn't think of a better way of taking us back and forth in time. It's the elders who steal the show. While Eastwood brings a gentle and very likable charm to his Robert, Streep goes way beyond everybody else in embodying Francesca. She's an encyclopedia of body language and came show passion by degrees. Watch the initial scenes where she keeps rubbing her hands and moving a little backwards as she's speaking to Robert, a usual sign for initial discomfort while talking to strangers. Later, when she's closer to Robert and meets him at the bridge, the two shake hands and we see Meryl use both her hands to greet him (keeping one of top of other), usually done while greeting more warmly. A very erotic moment doesn't involve sex but happens when Francesca simply adjusts Robert's collar and places her hand on his shoulder; you know Streep's worked her magic by watching Eastwood's expressions. Bridges of Madison County is a decent film that's worth watching once for Eastwood and twice for Streep. But one should be willing to endure some contrived writing, middling supporting performances and weak framing device.

There is always what I call a rare breed in which I am so sucked into a film that I praise it is sheer excellence and regarded as a favorite. Terry Gilliam's The Fisher King is such a movie. The story's central focus is on Jack, a radio talk-show host (Jeff Bridges) who says insensitive remarks to a caller, who in turn shoots up a diner. 8 people are killed, and so is Jack's career. Three years later, he lives in drunkenness and self-loathing with his long-suffering girlfriend Anne (Mercedes Ruehl). Chance so happens one night that he is rescued from a couple of thugs by a group of homeless men, led by an individual named Parry (Robin Williams). It just so happens that Parry is one of the surviving victims from the diner massacre. As a means of redemption, Jack seeks to aid Parry in wooing a quirky girl, Lydia (Amanda Plummer) whom he has grown smitten with. The plot itself sounds pretty deep and it would make great for a novel. In fact, most of the best movies are based off books (ex The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption). Surprisingly though, this film is entirely written for the screen-a fresh, original idea. The writer for this movie knew well how to create a story and pack humor, adventure, fantasy, and even tragedy all in one. One of the best scenes in the movie takes place at a train station where Parry follows Lydia through a crowd. The scene starts as a mundane sequence of people walking to and fro, but it slowly morphs into a ballroom dance floor as everyone begins dancing while a lovestruck Parry pursues a clueless Lydia. It is amusing to watch and shows the imagination of Parry coming to life. The characters are not only well-written and well-developed, but the actors make them unique and real. Williams is known mostly for comedy and family films, but he also has an edge for the dramatic roles, as seen in Insomnia and Good Will Hunting. As Parry, he combines both elements of humor and drama to make an unforgettable performance as a good man who has lost his sanity, but is not too far gone from hope. He is funny, heart-warming, and even tragic. Too bad he was up against Tony Hopkins for Silence of the Lambs, for he probably would have won the coveted statue. Jeff Bridges physically and mentally transforms himself from the usual tough, laid back personas he often plays to a man who is trapped in regret and who wants to do something right in his life for his change. This is truly one of his best works. Mercedes Ruehl, who won an Oscar for her performance, is the real screen stealer. She is funny, but also a strong, passionate character that stands by her man and is willing to do just about anything to get him back on his feet. Amanda Plummer is limited in screen time, but she delivers excellent comic timing as the cute, yet dim-witted Lydia. She rivals Jacque Closseau when it comes to sight gags. Besides the writing and performances, director Terry Gilliam crafts a film without it being too much like his other works. HIs emphasis on vector shapes (like Jack's radio room and apartment), tilted camera angles, and sense of the fantastic is present; however, it is not too much in excess. It is different than 12 Monkeys and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen in terms of storytelling style and visual imagery, which I think is a good thing. His work can get very bizarre. This may have been because he did not write the script (unlike Baron Munchausen and 12 Monkeys). Even so, he does a fine job and proves to be a very unique director. The other thing worth noting is that The Fisher King explores an aspect that seems to be neglected in movies, and that is the issue of homelessness. While most people think homeless people as lazy bums, this movie shows that there is a reason behind it. Each person has a story of their own and that is what can lead him or her into such an unsavory situation. We're all people after all. But it is a good and hopeful thought for someone to pitch in and help.To sum up, The Fisher King is a movie that I was hooked to from start to finish. And this is because of the overall excellence that everyone put in part to film. Great characters, great writing, great storytelling, great direction. There is nothing more I can ask for in a movie.

There is always what I call a rare breed in which I am so sucked into a film that I praise it is sheer excellence and regarded as a favorite. Terry Gilliam's The Fisher King is such a movie. The story's central focus is on Jack, a radio talk-show host (Jeff Bridges) who says insensitive remarks to a caller, who in turn shoots up a diner. 8 people are killed, and so is Jack's career. Three years later, he lives in drunkenness and self-loathing with his long-suffering girlfriend Anne (Mercedes Ruehl). Chance so happens one night that he is rescued from a couple of thugs by a group of homeless men, led by an individual named Parry (Robin Williams). It just so happens that Parry is one of the surviving victims from the diner massacre. As a means of redemption, Jack seeks to aid Parry in wooing a quirky girl, Lydia (Amanda Plummer) whom he has grown smitten with. The plot itself sounds pretty deep and it would make great for a novel. In fact, most of the best movies are based off books (ex The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption). Surprisingly though, this film is entirely written for the screen-a fresh, original idea. The writer for this movie knew well how to create a story and pack humor, adventure, fantasy, and even tragedy all in one. One of the best scenes in the movie takes place at a train station where Parry follows Lydia through a crowd. The scene starts as a mundane sequence of people walking to and fro, but it slowly morphs into a ballroom dance floor as everyone begins dancing while a lovestruck Parry pursues a clueless Lydia. It is amusing to watch and shows the imagination of Parry coming to life. The characters are not only well-written and well-developed, but the actors make them unique and real. Williams is known mostly for comedy and family films, but he also has an edge for the dramatic roles, as seen in Insomnia and Good Will Hunting. As Parry, he combines both elements of humor and drama to make an unforgettable performance as a good man who has lost his sanity, but is not too far gone from hope. He is funny, heart-warming, and even tragic. Too bad he was up against Tony Hopkins for Silence of the Lambs, for he probably would have won the coveted statue. Jeff Bridges physically and mentally transforms himself from the usual tough, laid back personas he often plays to a man who is trapped in regret and who wants to do something right in his life for his change. This is truly one of his best works. Mercedes Ruehl, who won an Oscar for her performance, is the real screen stealer. She is funny, but also a strong, passionate character that stands by her man and is willing to do just about anything to get him back on his feet. Amanda Plummer is limited in screen time, but she delivers excellent comic timing as the cute, yet dim-witted Lydia. She rivals Jacque Closseau when it comes to sight gags.

However, having read both parts, watched a BBC version of both parts, and also seen an amalgamation of both plays on stage I can say that I am much more familiar with it so that I can have a different understanding of this film.When I had first seen the film I had liked it, and I must say that I still like it, but the second time around, including being more familiar with Henry IV, I must say that it did not appeal to me as much. In part I think Van Sant has pulled away significantly from the original play with regards to the themes of the play as well as with regards to the character of Scott (played by Keanu Reeves and is Hal from the play). In a way Scott and Hal are both rebellious teenagers, but Scott is much more conscious of his desire to 'come good' when he turns 21 whereas this does not seem to be the case with Hal. In fact Hal has to prove to his father that he desires to become good, whereas it is clear from the film that Scott is in no danger of losing his inheritance.In Henry IV Poins is more of a supporting character who acts not so much as Hal's conscience but rather as a friend. In the film though Mike (River Pheonix, who corresponds with Poins) plays a much more important and central role. In fact the film is actually focused on Mike, as he goes on a fruitless search for his mother. There is tension between Mike and Scott because it is clear that Mike loves Scott but this love is not returned. This is something that we know is never going to happen, particularly when Scott says at the opening that as long as you do it for money then it is okay, but as soon as you begin to do it for free, you grow wings (and with that he then looks up at Mike as if suggesting that Mike has already grown wings). Another difference we see is that Scott readily deserts Scott when he gets his inheritance and finds the woman that he takes as his wife (though there is no indicating that there is any love, and we raise the question as to whether Scott is capable of love).Henry IV is many cases is about the right of passage that Hal takes from being a rebellious teenager to becoming a king, but this is something that we do not necessarily see here. Scott is not going through a rite of passage, nor is he learning, he is just having fun and behaving like a child while he is a child, and when he comes into his inheritance, he rejects his past and moves on. Okay, at the final scene, were the two funerals are contrasted (and one could say that both of Scott's fathers have died and are being buried) we see a part of Scott looking on at the other funeral. In a way the past has died, but one past, that of the wild and chaotic nature of youth, is also being buried to be replaced with the cold, clinical nature of adult life.I actually found Van Sant's attempts at Shakespearian language to be rather contrived. In the two scenes which are clearly taken from the play, that of Scott's rejection of Bob (who is the Falstaff figure) and the scene were he is mocking Bob after the robbery, we see that Van Sant is trying to create the poetic nature of the original play but using modern language in doing so. To me this fails completely. I can sort of see what he is going, and in a way he is using the play to build upon Scott's character, but the thing is that the movie is focused on Mike and not on Scott.Mike is vulnerable in many ways. Not only does he not understand himself, or even his sexuality (he confuses friendship with erotic love, and this is something that is not returned) he suffers from Narcolepsy. As long as Scott is around, Mike is safe, but as soon as Scott leaves we discover that he is more vulnerable than ever. In a way Mike's search for his mother is his search for security, in the same way that his quest for love is also his quest for security. We know that as long as Scott is around, Mike is secure, but when we see him on the street, back in Portland, we know that this is no longer the case.Then there is Idaho. The movie begins in Idaho, ends in Idaho, and visits Idaho in the middle. It is as if it is this tranquil place between the horrors of the world outside. It is the world of the unique, of the quite, and of the peaceful that pushes away the world of the street. We see the street in Seattle, in Portland, and even in Rome. Granted, we leave Rome for the country, but in a way it is not Idaho. Mike feels secure in Idaho, but not in Italy. However, we learn at the end that no even Idaho offers that protection, for when he collapses again, he is robbed. I guess the idea of the title suggests that is the case, one's search for peace, and that part inside of you were you can feel secure.

Well, I suppose it actually depends on which version you see. One version definitely rolls a little smoother than the other. For those that aren't aware, there are two versions of SUPERMAN II the Richard Lester version released in U.S. theaters in 1981 and the Richard Donner re-cut version released on home video in 2006. Regardless of which version you've seen, they both follow the same basic premise as a direct sequel to SUPERMAN. In the first film, we see Jor-El and a council on Krypton addressing three criminals who have attempted treason against their government before sentencing them to the Phantom Zone. These criminals, under the command of General Zod, are later released in the vicinity of Earth, where they arrive with intention of dominating our species. As a bonus, Zod sees an opportunity to gain revenge against the son of the man who condemned him&#x85;Kal-El, son of Jor-El. I'm sure Superman would be eager to stop these villains if he weren't so busy chasing Lois Lane. In the time since the original SUPERMAN, Lois has become suspicious of Clark Kent and has almost made the connection between him and Superman. So Lois continues searching for the final evidence to Superman's identity, while Clark continues battling his feelings for Lois, and Zod strolls around conquering Earth without breaking a sweat. Meanwhile, for those who couldn't get enough Lex Luthor in the first film, he returns in SUPERMAN II to&#x85;I dunno&#x85;move the plot along. And steal Australia. He wants Australia.I've gone and watched both versions and I agree with the majority on this one the Richard Donner version is much better than Lester's. It's no surprise. Donner originally intended SUPERMAN and it's sequel to be shot at the same time and work together to create one epic cohesive story. Then the producers and Donner encountered some creative differences, Donner was let go from his position, and the producers brought in Lester to finish the second film. Lester than opted to amp up the humor in the movie and brought the campiness. This is most apparent in a scene late in the movie when Superman is battling the Kryptonian supervillains in Metropolis and the villains utilize their super-breath to swat away the rioting civilians. Lester used this opportunity to throw in any goofy thing he could think of&#x85;man on rollerblades, man who refuses to get off payphone as it's blowing down the street, etc. Donner, on the other hand, has a bit more respect for his Superman movies. It's a shame his re-cut of the second movie would be the last time Donner worked on the series. Donner had bits of comic relief in his film (i.e. Warren Beatty as Lex Luthor's bumbling henchman Otis) but it's primarily gone in this movie and the any laughs come from genuine character moments. Luthor is still an grandiose lunatic with an evil bent and a lust for real estate, and Gene Hackman's return to the role is one the best parts of the film. Granted, he really doesn't have much to do this time around. He's not the main villain of the piece (despite his best efforts) and his only real job is to direct Zod and his team in the right direction to keep the plot moving while giving us a few laughs.Donner's vision for Superman was one of grand scale fantasy with action, adventure, romance, and humor. Despite Lester's best efforts, even his version maintains some of these elements. SUPERMAN II has got even better action than the first film because Superman finally has someone he can go toe-to-toe with. Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran) are super-powered Kryptonians with all of Superman's strengths with an added bonus pure evil with no compassion for the human race. Together, they just might be more than the Man of Steel can handle as we see in a battle in the streets of Metropolis. Zod is one of those memorable on-screen comic villains and Stamp brought him to life with a massive superiority complex that helped make Kneel before Zod! so memorable a line. Outside this, there isn't a whole lot of meat to the evil Kryptonians in SUPERMAN II. They're super-powered and evil, they want to rule the Earth, and they hold a grudge against Kal-El. That's about all the character development we receive for our villains but I give it a pass because they're so fun to watch.Christopher Reeves once again proves he was a perfect choice for his role as the Man of Steel and Margot Kidder returns as the spunky Lois Lane. Their chemistry together is on display again as, just as with the first SUPERMAN, we spend a heavy chunk of time watching the development of their relationship. Whereas the first movie was the blossoming love of Clark for Lois (and Lois for Superman), SUPERMAN II takes it to the next level with Lois putting the pieces together to discover Superman's true identity. The results in Superman and Lois being absent from the action for the first half of the movie as he courts her in his Fortress of Solitude and engages in some plot holes until Superman finally catches a newscast and realizes, Whoops, I should be saving the planet right about now.

Well, I suppose it actually depends on which version you see. One version definitely rolls a little smoother than the other. For those that aren't aware, there are two versions of SUPERMAN II the Richard Lester version released in U.S. theaters in 1981 and the Richard Donner re-cut version released on home video in 2006. Regardless of which version you've seen, they both follow the same basic premise as a direct sequel to SUPERMAN. In the first film, we see Jor-El and a council on Krypton addressing three criminals who have attempted treason against their government before sentencing them to the Phantom Zone. These criminals, under the command of General Zod, are later released in the vicinity of Earth, where they arrive with intention of dominating our species. As a bonus, Zod sees an opportunity to gain revenge against the son of the man who condemned him&#x85;Kal-El, son of Jor-El. I'm sure Superman would be eager to stop these villains if he weren't so busy chasing Lois Lane. In the time since the original SUPERMAN, Lois has become suspicious of Clark Kent and has almost made the connection between him and Superman. So Lois continues searching for the final evidence to Superman's identity, while Clark continues battling his feelings for Lois, and Zod strolls around conquering Earth without breaking a sweat. Meanwhile, for those who couldn't get enough Lex Luthor in the first film, he returns in SUPERMAN II to&#x85;I dunno&#x85;move the plot along. And steal Australia. He wants Australia.I've gone and watched both versions and I agree with the majority on this one the Richard Donner version is much better than Lester's. It's no surprise. Donner originally intended SUPERMAN and it's sequel to be shot at the same time and work together to create one epic cohesive story. Then the producers and Donner encountered some creative differences, Donner was let go from his position, and the producers brought in Lester to finish the second film. Lester than opted to amp up the humor in the movie and brought the campiness. This is most apparent in a scene late in the movie when Superman is battling the Kryptonian supervillains in Metropolis and the villains utilize their super-breath to swat away the rioting civilians. Lester used this opportunity to throw in any goofy thing he could think of&#x85;man on rollerblades, man who refuses to get off payphone as it's blowing down the street, etc. Donner, on the other hand, has a bit more respect for his Superman movies. It's a shame his re-cut of the second movie would be the last time Donner worked on the series. Donner had bits of comic relief in his film (i.e. Warren Beatty as Lex Luthor's bumbling henchman Otis) but it's primarily gone in this movie and the any laughs come from genuine character moments. Luthor is still an grandiose lunatic with an evil bent and a lust for real estate, and Gene Hackman's return to the role is one the best parts of the film. Granted, he really doesn't have much to do this time around. He's not the main villain of the piece (despite his best efforts) and his only real job is to direct Zod and his team in the right direction to keep the plot moving while giving us a few laughs.Donner's vision for Superman was one of grand scale fantasy with action, adventure, romance, and humor. Despite Lester's best efforts, even his version maintains some of these elements. SUPERMAN II has got even better action than the first film because Superman finally has someone he can go toe-to-toe with. Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran) are super-powered Kryptonians with all of Superman's strengths with an added bonus pure evil with no compassion for the human race. Together, they just might be more than the Man of Steel can handle as we see in a battle in the streets of Metropolis. Zod is one of those memorable on-screen comic villains and Stamp brought him to life with a massive superiority complex that helped make Kneel before Zod! so memorable a line. Outside this, there isn't a whole lot of meat to the evil Kryptonians in SUPERMAN II. They're super-powered and evil, they want to rule the Earth, and they hold a grudge against Kal-El. That's about all the character development we receive for our villains but I give it a pass because they're so fun to watch.Christopher Reeves once again proves he was a perfect choice for his role as the Man of Steel and Margot Kidder returns as the spunky Lois Lane. Their chemistry together is on display again as, just as with the first SUPERMAN, we spend a heavy chunk of time watching the development of their relationship. Whereas the first movie was the blossoming love of Clark for Lois (and Lois for Superman), SUPERMAN II takes it to the next level with Lois putting the pieces together to discover Superman's true identity. The results in Superman and Lois being absent from the action for the first half of the movie as he courts her in his Fortress of Solitude and engages in some plot holes until Superman finally catches a newscast and realizes, Whoops, I should be saving the planet right about now.

The title was so lengthy that I thought it worked quite well as a gag, until I realized it was the title of the original book, written by Dr. Reuben. Woody Allen didn't have to work hard to find a proper title, this one worked perfectly... now, to say that the film delivers its premise is a matter of opinion.It's also worth noticing that the film was released in 1972, a breakthrough year for movies rich on sexual content, whether intriguing, disturbing or hilarious. From the ill-fated Ned Beatty forced to 'squeal like a pig' in Deliverance to the infamous 'butter' scene between Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider in Last Tango in Paris, from the first animated pornographic movie Fritz the Cat to the no-less graphic milestone Deep Throat ... the three letters had been so involved in movie-making that we can talk of a before and after 1972.And since sex stopped to be a taboo in the middle of the New Hollywood wave, and people got accustomed to the sight of bodies voluptuously expressing their mutual love, what more efficient weapon than comedy to trivialize what was left from sex mysteries? And who was more gifted than Woody Allen to make a movie about sex and getting away with the most outrageous and irreverent aspects without even shocking our eyes or falling in a voyeuristic trap? Especially considering that if the educational value doesn't work, it's still a good way to spend 80 minutes laughing.I guess I minimize the pedagogical effort because the 'You' refers to a 1972 audience, and forty years before, it's a fair guess to assume that sex wasn't as abundantly exposed as today (one word Internet). The film seems almost innocent in its approach of sex as it features some cute-looking rabbits in the opening credits sequence. But when you watch a slut whipping a rabbi while his wife eats pork to fulfill one of his pervert fantasies, you know it's a Woody Allen film and the tone is less innocent than what it seems, 'rising above vulgarity' if I might use this quote from Mel Brooks.The movie is a kaleidoscopes of many issues involving sex aphrodisiacs, transvestites, frigidity, one hilarious spoof of What's my Line transformed into What's My Perversion, science, bestiality etc. and the film reaches its paroxysm of hilarity through the final segment a sexual act recounted from the perspective of a NASA mission where everything is operated from the brain, a la Fantastic Voyage with a nice teamwork between Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds, this is one of the highlights of Woody Allen's zany period and the sight of all the little sperms waiting like paratroopers for the orgasm and wondering what awaits him on the other side, makes me laugh just thinking about them.You got it; gags are the film's reason to be, while sex is only the set-up of Allen's sketches. One involves an unfunny court jester who, like Hamlet, (TB or not TB, that's the congestion) meets the ghost of his father and is ordered to bang the queen (Lynn Redgrave) he uses a magic love potion, but meets the chastity belt as an unfortunate obstacle. The following segment recounts the affair between Dr. Ross (Gene Wilder) and an adorable sheep named Daisy. There is no logic in Woody Allen's sketches, but the actors seem so involved in their role that it works. As crazy as it is, the film is one of Allen's most brilliantly cast.I won't enumerate every segment because one of the film's delights is to get from one to another with only sex as the common denominator. The last one was my favorite for its brilliant metaphorical depiction of erections, guilt, and emotional struggle before the act, but I also have a soft spot for John Carradine's role as the mad scientist and his crazy experimental situations. The 'tits' part includes a succession of hilarious lines; the correlation between excessive masturbation and going into politics made me burst into tears. The part is a great homage to 50's B-movies, with a giant tit as a blob-like monster, like a clever satire on the feminist revolution in march swallowing everyone attempting to block its path.The segments aren't equally hilarious, a nice parody of Italian movies lacked a punch-line, but this never hurts the film as the main purpose is to us about the taboo-ness of sex through laughs. Sex is such a serious thing one should make fun of it after all. I mentioned Mel Brooks earlier, I guess the film is to sex what Mel Brooks' The History of the World Part I is to history, but the Allen touch exists within the script, the zaniness and the little ounce of wisdom popping us between two outrageous lines.

This is only one example of many of the cinematic poetry used in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire. Homer is very reminiscent of another Homer The author of the Iliad. All of his dialog and even his blocking from the library scene to the couch in the middle of the field is pure poetry. In fact, the film itself is bookended in poetry. The movie starts with an angel Damiel writing in his journal when the child was still a child he had questions about the world, was not picky, and was generally more cooperative. The tale is told in German in a sing-song voice, Als Das kind kind war... He sits next to his Angel friend Cassiel (played by Otto Sadler, who previously starred in the epic movie Das Boot) in a convertible with the light reflecting off the windshield in such a way that it looks like wings. Damiel and Cassiel compare notes of what they have witnessed. The angels move around unseen among the people of Berlin, reading people's thoughts and whispering comforting words to people. The people too, are not completely seen by the angels. The angels can only view the world in black and white. While privy to all that will happen in the world and to immortality, angels do not know what it is like to feel, to taste, or to be acknowledged by a stranger. Damiel tells Cassiel that while it is great to live for eternity, he sometimes gets fed up with his spiritual existence. He longs to have blackened fingers from the newspaper, to have a fever, or to be excited by a meal. Cassiel reminds him that they are there to do no more that to preserve, collect, and testify. This too is poetry. The angels like to spend much time in the library. The library is full of books of knowledge and therefore seen as a sacred place. They are seen whispering to people who are reading, perhaps trying to inspire them. The irony is that the books contain text which the angels can see. Text, like the angels, can inspire a person only if he or she is open to it. Ironically, even though human beings cannot see angels, the angels, even though they read thoughts, cannot see the pictures painted by the imagination in the minds of the humans when reading text. Damiel yearns to be human even more when he goes to the circus and falls in love with his own angel a trapeze artist that is dressed like an angel. He tells Cassiel that he wants to be human. Cassiel, in another example of cinematic poetry, brings albeit reluctantly, Damiel through the Berlin wall where he transforms to the human state and everything turns to color. Damiel and Cassiel are as symbolic as the Berlin wall that they pass through, as they are opposites. Damiel, free like the West, full of dreams and the desire to choose. Cassiel on the other hand is like the East Rigid, does as instructed, no free thought or desires. Meanwhile in a subplot, the angels have been following Peter Falk who has come to Germany to make a film. Falk tells Damiel, I can't see you, but I know that you are there. When Damiel turns human, he looks up Peter Falk and Falk reveals that he too used to be an angel. When Damiel asks him what to do or expect, Falk tells him that he has to figure it out and that's what makes it fun. Damiel leaves to go find his trapeze artist. After a series of near misses, Damiel and his trapeze artist end up at the same bar. Meanwhile, in another example of cinematic poetry, Cassiel closes his eyes in the bar and then the stage lights cast three different shadows off his body, alternating and shifting location and color as if the audience is watching him break into pieces.

Riggs and Murtaugh now must figure out how to work together and solve the case while at the same time try to get to know one another and figure each other out and Murtaugh get used to Riggs as a Lethal Weapon.Lethal Weapon is one of those Action movie classics that made me fall in love with the Action genre and gave viewers an introduction to one of the greatest film screen duos of all time Riggs and Murtaugh and a masterful introduction to the amazing Lethal Weapon series. Right from the opening credits to the end you are glued to the screen because of the Action,thrills,suspense and memorable characters in the film. I think that one of the reasons Lethal Weapon is such a brilliant film is because the film took the Buddy cop concept of the Action-Comedy Walter Hill classic 48 Hrs and flipped it and instead of being the cop and criminal this time both are cops. It's no coincidence that both Lethal Weapon and 48 Hrs were both co-produced by Joel Silver. Where as the other Lethal Weapon sequels we're light and much more comedic,LW1 is more gritty and dark because LW1 while an Action is also a great character study of Riggs and Murtaugh because the film shows that Riggs is depressed and on the verge of suicide while Murtaugh has to deal with getting older and his new partner Riggs. And while LW is a serious Action film there are moments of funny humor but the Humor is done in a cynical tone and the comedy is not as over the top as the sequels. LW in some way bridged a gap between the Action films of the 70s and 80s and the early 90s by being serious with a dark sense of Humor. That being said I love all of the LW films. The screenplay by Shane Black is brilliant and excellent,well-written and one of the best Action screenplays of all time with Black giving the main characters memorable dialog with some dark humor and giving the two main characters powerful depth. Black would continue writing brilliant Action scripts with Lethal Weapon 2,The Last Boy Scout,The Long Kiss Goodnight and Kiss,Kiss,Bang,Bang. Riggs and Murtaugh are classic characters of Action films and cinema in general. Like any great Action buddy film,Riggs and Murtaugh at first don't like each other and it's not only because the two don't want to work with one another it's also because of how opposite the two are. Riggs is more wild and filled with energy where as Murtaugh is more straight and narrow but as the film goes on Riggs and Murtaugh begin to understand and like each other. Riggs and Murtaugh feel like real characters who not stereotypes but real people that viewers can relate to. It is the difference between the characters that makes Riggs and Murtaugh so great and entertaining and the banter and dialog makes this film and the other LW films so amazing and watchable. I also love the villains in the film and despite the villains not having much screen time they are vicious and dark in the way they do things and leave a huge impression. The film moves at a great pace and never slows down once the Action kicks into high gear The Action scenes in the film are excellent and handled with intensity and white hot suspense and the Action scenes would get better and bigger as the LW films went on. The final 20-30 minutes are among the best endings that you will see in a Action film and it is so thrilling and Action packed that you will barely have time to catch your breath. It is an excellent ending that will stay in you after the film is over and will put a smile on viewers faces.The whole cast is great in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are excellent and at their best as Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh,with Gibson and Glover bringing depth,intensity and great chemistry to their roles. Gary Busey(Joshua) and Mitchell Ryan(The General)are great and menacing as the villains in the film. Tom Atkins is wonderful as Michael Hunsaker,Roger's old friend. Steve Kahan(Capt. Ed Murphy),Mary Ellen Trainor(Psychologist),Ed Ross(Mendez),Darlene Love(Trish Murtaugh),Traci Wolfe(Rianne Murtaugh),Damon Hines(Nick Murtaugh),Ebonie Smith(Carrie Murtaugh),Lycia Naff(Dixie)and Al Leong give good performances as well.The direction by Richard Donner is brilliant,with Donner always moving the camera and giving the film a great style and tone to the film and Donner also does a great job with the Action scenes. Amazing direction by Donner.The score by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen is masterful,powerful and one of the best scores in an Action film. A great score by Clapton and Kamen. I also loved the use of the classic Christmas song Jingle Bell Rock by Bobby Helms.In final word if you love Action films,Thrillers or films in general I highly suggest you see Lethal Weapon,a masterful start to a great series and a unforgettable Action classic that you can watch again and again.

Somehow the monster escapes from the burning windmill laboratory, scaring the daylights out of the shrill Una O'Connor here. Nowhere in sight at the finale of Frankenstein, O'Connor (wearing a head piece that looks like it came off of Dr. Frankenstein's wedding cake) dominates much of the film (as does Thesiger), and for once, a change of mood makes the follow-up even better than the original. For The Bride of Frankenstein is delightfully campy, utilizing many elements that Mel Brooks couldn't resist overplaying when he wrote his own comic version of the tale Young Frankenstein 40 years later.It all starts off with an enjoyable prologue where Elsa Lanchaster, as the real Mary Shelley, tells her pals Wait, there's more!. The return of the monster brings out the wacky Dr. Pretorious, his collection of tiny creatures (a plot devise stolen for The Devil Doll the following year), and the monster's meeting with the blind man. Having seen Young Frankenstein more times than this, I couldn't help but quote lines from that (Wait! I was going to make espresso!) during that sequence, and when Elsa Lanchaster comes back for the final moments as the bride, it not only brought back memories of Madeline Kahn in the Mel Brooks classic but her repeat of the character on Saturday Night Live singing I Feel Pretty.John Carradine, who would go on to horror movie fame in his prime, has a brief appearance here as the hunter who discovers the monster along with the blind man, and Sherlock Holmes housekeeper Mary Gordon has a brief walk-on as one of the monster's earlier victims whose demise is almost comical in retrospect. As for Karloff's bringing speech into the monster's life, it is fine for one entry, especially comical for many of the scenes. Artistically, the film is breathtaking to look at, also returning Colin Clive as the doctor, with Valarie Hobson taking over the role of Elizabeth, previously played by Mae Clarke.

Being a very political minded man he instilled family values as well as pride for our country.

Soylent Green was shown at midnight, after the family friendly main features.This story was brand new to me and I found it quite disturbing, but not for its major twist near the end. What really upset me was the general theme of unconscious overuse which led up to the conclusion. Homelessness was only then starting to spread to medium sized metropolitan areas but it was obvious that the future quality of living portrayed in this story is not a fantasy but almost a forgone conclusion, unless people as individuals really start thinking about the future as a consequence of their actions today.Edward G Robinson's last scene was so well done, in part due to his knowledge of his own terminal illness which took his life quite shortly after this production ended. Celia Lovsky and Joseph Cotten delivered their performances equally well, as their own long careers came to an end not long after as well, and there was a poignancy and profound sadness to their roles that one rarely sees on the big screen.I loved every single production element in Soylent Green. The casting was excellent, especially the addition of the elderly actors from the 1940s who provided an air of authenticity to those who were in their prime in 1973. The opening credits were a perfect introduction to the story, showing the ultimate cost of progress without a doubt. The production values were realistic and not afraid to show the gritty side of life and the scattered centers that may truly become our reality. If we do not soon halt the relentless population growth and continue to haphazardly birth baby after baby, regardless of the strain on resources and finances, then we will reap what we have truly sown.This story is prophetic, realistic, heartbreaking, and inspirational, despite its overall theme of hopelessness for the future. The apathy of today's society could use a real wake up call, and this story could serve that purpose. I recommend watching it as a family, even with the little ones (who probably will not catch onto the ultimate message). Let it form the basis of a discussion of the environment and the need for all people see the future based on our actions of today, so a drastic scenario such as this might be escaped.

So it shouldn't shock many (now) that Walt Disney decided to take on this project and adapt Jules Verne's story to the big screen. But here's the game changer, the cast has big name actors, the special effects are fantastic, the props are spectacular and the screenplay was well revised.The story takes place in the late 1800's where a Professor Aronnax (Paul Lukas) and his assistant Conseil (Peter Lorre) are put their knowledge and well being to the test when they are given the opportunity of a life time. Recently, there have been sightings of a sea monster attacking vessels out on the open sea. The offer, is to sail with the US navy to track down the monster and destroy it. At first the professor and his assistant were curious, but soon audiences will watch them grow and understand that the answers they were hoping for, were not even close to what they thought they could be.Aboard this ship is Ned Land (Kirk Douglas), a master harpooner who seems to have an attitude with authority but in the most lighthearted and high-spirited way. But another character that is one of the most intriguing and hard to figure out characters is Captain Nemo, brilliantly played by James Mason. The way Mason portrays his character makes it so hard to read. Mason acts with a controlled yet ferocious hatred, but it never seems like that. In fact, he may seem a little mad (crazy), but he will always use a sophisticated vocabulary.Also, for 1954 the special effects and props were so convincing. Wait until you see that giant squid! Absolutely phenomenal! And because the film is in wide screen, it looks even better. The sets either on the ships, in the water beside the choral reefs or on an island looks great. The music provided by Paul L. Smith was much welcomed too. Since Smith has worked with Disney before on various other projects like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his score emits all the right feelings for each scene.The reason why I titled this as the classic among classic adventure tales because that's what it is. This is the purest of the pure in what this genre is. Setting out on a journey with no idea of what the end result may be is exactly what an adventure is. I mean, what else could you ask for? Sailing out to sea to find a monster sounds exciting and scary at the same time, plus you have cannons, island natives, underwater treasure and so on.

I was suspicious, as I had seen the film years earlier and thought it to be a good, not great film, but after that viewing, I now consider it to be a truly great film.The film tells the story of four soldiers who return home to Boone City after the end of WWII. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns home to his wife (Myrna Loy) and daughter, Peggy (Teresa Wright). Al also has a son, but he disappears almost entirely by the middle of the film. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) returns home to a wife (Virginia Mayo) who doesn't seem much like the woman he thought he married and alternatively he is drawn romantically to Peggy. Finally there is Homer (Harold Russell) who returns home to his family and girlfriend with the news that due to war injuries he no longer has his hands; instead two hooks are in their place. The story follows these three men as they attempt to navigate the, not always smooth, transition from wartime to peacetime life as civilians. As evidenced by this film, not every problem was solved by the GI Bill. Memories (and wounds) of the war still linger. The film is not only a fascinating character study of soldiers but also of their loved ones as well. The way the film weaves the stories of these three distinct men together is a storytelling masterstroke. All of their stories fit together, yet are different (they come from different economic backgrounds, for example) and nothing seems forced. Every member of the cast does a wonderful job from the leads to the actors in smaller roles like Virginia Mayo and Gladys George. March's performance is exquisite as he struggles to return to normalcy, especially at his job. Myrna Loy (has there ever been a classier actress?) is great as March's wife. Loy gives a restrained performance but one that radiates beautifully throughout the entire film. Harold Russell won two Oscars for his work here, one was honorary. Is it a great performance? No. But it sure is moving. The producer Sam Goldwyn and director William Wyler deserve credit for casting an actual amputee in the role. This is especially noteworthy when considering how frequently white actors played Asians and Native Americans in those days. When Goldwyn and Wyler could've cast anyone, they instead turned to Russell and the film is much better and more authentic because of that choice. Dana Andrews just might have given the best performance in the entire film. His part is probably the film's most complicated one. His character struggles perhaps the most both in terms of his personal life and in his job. Andrews successfully navigates this course so brilliantly; an honest, subtle, and charming performance.Overall, this film is nearly perfect with the exception of the overreaching score. In my estimation, it is Wyler's best film as well as the best movie about soldiers returning home, and yes maybe one of the greatest American films of all time.

I was suspicious, as I had seen the film years earlier and thought it to be a good, not great film, but after that viewing, I now consider it to be a truly great film.The film tells the story of four soldiers who return home to Boone City after the end of WWII. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns home to his wife (Myrna Loy) and daughter, Peggy (Teresa Wright). Al also has a son, but he disappears almost entirely by the middle of the film. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) returns home to a wife (Virginia Mayo) who doesn't seem much like the woman he thought he married and alternatively he is drawn romantically to Peggy. Finally there is Homer (Harold Russell) who returns home to his family and girlfriend with the news that due to war injuries he no longer has his hands; instead two hooks are in their place. The story follows these three men as they attempt to navigate the, not always smooth, transition from wartime to peacetime life as civilians. As evidenced by this film, not every problem was solved by the GI Bill. Memories (and wounds) of the war still linger. The film is not only a fascinating character study of soldiers but also of their loved ones as well. The way the film weaves the stories of these three distinct men together is a storytelling masterstroke. All of their stories fit together, yet are different (they come from different economic backgrounds, for example) and nothing seems forced. Every member of the cast does a wonderful job from the leads to the actors in smaller roles like Virginia Mayo and Gladys George. March's performance is exquisite as he struggles to return to normalcy, especially at his job. Myrna Loy (has there ever been a classier actress?) is great as March's wife. Loy gives a restrained performance but one that radiates beautifully throughout the entire film. Harold Russell won two Oscars for his work here, one was honorary. Is it a great performance? No. But it sure is moving. The producer Sam Goldwyn and director William Wyler deserve credit for casting an actual amputee in the role. This is especially noteworthy when considering how frequently white actors played Asians and Native Americans in those days. When Goldwyn and Wyler could've cast anyone, they instead turned to Russell and the film is much better and more authentic because of that choice. Dana Andrews just might have given the best performance in the entire film. His part is probably the film's most complicated one. His character struggles perhaps the most both in terms of his personal life and in his job. Andrews successfully navigates this course so brilliantly; an honest, subtle, and charming performance.Overall, this film is nearly perfect with the exception of the overreaching score. In my estimation, it is Wyler's best film as well as the best movie about soldiers returning home, and yes maybe one of the greatest American films of all time.

Now Basil Rathbone's doctor has been replaced by his brother (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) who, along with an assistant (Lionel Atwill, given back his arm after granted a new part after the third installment) who longs to put a decent brain in the misunderstood monster. But Bela Lugosi's Igor longs to get out of his broken-necked body and into Frankie boy's, and that's where the horror comes in. Scream queen Evelyn Ankers gets more than her share of horror as Hardwicke's daughter, with Ralph Bellamy her love interest here after their earlier pairing in The Wolf Man.Former Wolfie Lon Chaney Jr. takes on the role of the monster here, properly grunting and snorting as directed, but by this point, the monster wasn't really about the heart that Karloff had instilled, mainly to scare the people who sought to stop him. The presence of a little girl whom the monster befriends seems an effort to write the wrongs of the poor child in the first film, but unlike Karloff's monster, this one really is a total nightmare. Quite B looking as compared to the first three, it manages to remain entertaining with Lugosi enjoying every moment being over the top, basically running rampant over everybody else in the film.

Richard Harris' Dumbledore is calm and wise, as he should be, we trust and revere him implicitly, Snape (Rickman) has the appropriate level of menacing sweep, his opening scene is arguably the highlight of the entire series as he informs us, quivering in our over-sized robes in our first week, that we can learn how to put a stopped in death, and Emma Watson is delightfully bossy as Hermione. She is, of the main three, the one who shines throughout all, with arguably the hardest part, she brings emotion, intelligence and a hefty helping of guts to a well-loved character. The film is not big and brash, unlike some its successors, it is simple and relies on the quality of the story being told and the actors doing that. It makes little or no go at impressing the audience, and in doing so, embodies a childlike inquisitiveness and charms its audience into caring about mirrors and stones and 'silly incantations.' That is its pivotal achievement; that it can take the viewer back to a moment before they knew what a tax return was, or that Voldermort would rise again. Right from the moment Richard Griffiths practically sneers 'No post on Sundays,' you know the film will make an admirable attempt at recreating the magic of the books, but try as it might, it eventually falls short of the standard required to do justice to a novel, which whilst it may not be expertly crafted, had enough about it to capture the hearts of a generation. At eleven Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was one of the most awe inspiring things I'd seen, but several years on, it leaves something to be desired.
