It is both a coming of age story about the children as well as a hard-hitting drama, as Atticus defends a black man who is on trial for the rape of a white woman.  This review is not an easy one to write, despite the fact that I have seen this film at least 10 times.  The reason it does not come easily is that this is one of the most personally important films I have ever seen and is in my personal `Top Five of All Time'.  I'm certain there is nothing that can be said about the film that has not already been repeated a multitude of times, so I guess the best thing to do is explain why the film is so important to me.I first saw this film several years ago and was so profoundly affected by it that I immediately watched it again.  Of course, the defense of a man wrongly accused of a crime is a common story line, but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out as an exceptional example for several reasons.  Among them, the date that the film was released  1962, on the cusp of the civil rights movement in America, and the fact that it takes place in the south in the 1930's.  It is also far from the first film to explore the experiences of children and their own personal growth, but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out because of its sheer honesty and natural performances by the child actors portraying these rich characters.  But most of all, this film is special because of Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch, a true hero.  At the risk of sounding histrionic, my heart aches when I watch him on screen because he is such an incredible man, and is so inherently good.  No matter how many times I have seen this film, I smile when I see his interaction with his children, and I well with tears when I see his incredible strength of character.  (No easy feat to break through the armor of this cynical film geek who, if given the chance would remake at least a few dozen films with tragic endings.) I was sitting in my car listening to National Public Radio recently the day Gregory Peck died, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I sat and cried hearing the retrospective they offered &#150; mainly because the man who portrayed my own personal cinematic hero was gone, but also because Peck lived his life with the same conviction as his best known role; a fact that makes Atticus Finch all the more tangible.  The American Film Institute recently named Atticus Finch the number one hero of all time, a choice I consider both brave and insightful in an age where our heroes generally either wield weapons or have super human physical strength.  Atticus Finch fights evil as well, but with his strong moral fiber and his mind.  To Kill a Mockingbird is generally required reading during the course of one's education.  If you have not read it, do so.  If you have not seen the film, do so; and share it with others.  It is an exceptional film that stands the test of time and will remain an important addition to film history for as long as the genre exists.  --Shelly  ","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 2003","score":"332 out of 380 people found the following review useful","review":"  To Kill a Mockingbird is the movie based on the Harper Lee novel of the same name about Scout, Jem and their father, Atticus Finch who is an attorney in a small southern town.

It falls somewhere between the zaniness of Airplane and the black comedy of Doctor Strangelove. It's far funnier than other let's-go-to-war-for-political-reason movies like The Mouse That Roared or Wag the Dog, even though it doesn't seem to have had much of a budget. Yes, it's silly, but what makes the jokes effective is that they follow a scenario that has become so familiar to us in real life. An adversary or non-adversary like Canada (skewered here, as much as the US is) masses troops along its border. The media report Canadians are building a monstrous weapons system, that they are filtering across the border in untold numbers and are walking among us, that they plan to impose their way of life on us (enforcing anti-litter laws and pronouncing about as aboot.). They take a hostage. They put up the world's tallest free-standing structure as an in-your-face insult. We try to provoke some incident that we can claim as an attack in order to build up tension. The idea is not to go to war, because a war with Canada wouldn't last long enough. The idea is to return to the days of the cold war when we had a booming defense industry, lots of solidarity, a common enemy, lived in constant fear of annihilation, and everyone was happy. Moore must have carefully combed the archives for every run-up to every war since Grenada. I don't want to get into it in any more detail because it would spoil the gags, but I'll mention just one. John Candy and his gang (there are lots of Canadians in the cast) are driving near Toronto (which they believe is the capital) in a garbage truck decorated with sprayed-on slogans like, Canada Sucks, and Eat my Drawers, and USA All the Way. They are pulled over by a motorcycle cop (Dan Aykroyd) who politely asks Candy to step out of the vehicle, leads him to the side of the truck, points at the graffiti and asks, What's wrong with this picture? Candy begins to stutter and blame the kids back in the garage, but Aykroyd cuts off his explanation and says he's not concerned about who put it there, but he IS concerned about Les Quebecoise. Every sign in Canada must be printed both in English and in French, and he makes Candy spray a French version of the slogans on the truck. Oh, well, one more -- just because it's short and offhand. The president and his advisors wonder how to get back the hostage the Canadians are holding. One aide suggests bringing in the Omega force. Everyone is awed by the suggestion. Even the rabid general asks, Isn't that a little drastic? And another adviser adds, Sir, the Helmsley Law, Part Two, Sub B, specifically forbids the use of the Omega force against Caucasians. Something like that.The acting is good, especially Allan Alda as the nudnik president, but little acting is required. As a director Moore gets the job done but doesn't add much. What made Doctor Strangelove exceptional was the realism between the comic moments, the battle scenes for instance. Here, Moore has the Omega force not just running across a field but high stepping, which isn't really as funny as it is silly. (The last man in line trips over a stone and sprains his ankle, hollers out, Save yourselves, and another one runs back and shoots him on the spot.) Moore as a writer turns out to be a more astute humorist than I'd expected him to be.

Yes, it's silly, but what makes the jokes effective is that they follow a scenario that has become so familiar to us in real life. An adversary or non-adversary like Canada (skewered here, as much as the US is) masses troops along its border. The media report Canadians are building a monstrous weapons system, that they are filtering across the border in untold numbers and are walking among us, that they plan to impose their way of life on us (enforcing anti-litter laws and pronouncing about as aboot.). They take a hostage. They put up the world's tallest free-standing structure as an in-your-face insult. We try to provoke some incident that we can claim as an attack in order to build up tension. The idea is not to go to war, because a war with Canada wouldn't last long enough. The idea is to return to the days of the cold war when we had a booming defense industry, lots of solidarity, a common enemy, lived in constant fear of annihilation, and everyone was happy. Moore must have carefully combed the archives for every run-up to every war since Grenada. I don't want to get into it in any more detail because it would spoil the gags, but I'll mention just one. John Candy and his gang (there are lots of Canadians in the cast) are driving near Toronto (which they believe is the capital) in a garbage truck decorated with sprayed-on slogans like, Canada Sucks, and Eat my Drawers, and USA All the Way. They are pulled over by a motorcycle cop (Dan Aykroyd) who politely asks Candy to step out of the vehicle, leads him to the side of the truck, points at the graffiti and asks, What's wrong with this picture? Candy begins to stutter and blame the kids back in the garage, but Aykroyd cuts off his explanation and says he's not concerned about who put it there, but he IS concerned about Les Quebecoise. Every sign in Canada must be printed both in English and in French, and he makes Candy spray a French version of the slogans on the truck. Oh, well, one more -- just because it's short and offhand. The president and his advisors wonder how to get back the hostage the Canadians are holding. One aide suggests bringing in the Omega force. Everyone is awed by the suggestion. Even the rabid general asks, Isn't that a little drastic? And another adviser adds, Sir, the Helmsley Law, Part Two, Sub B, specifically forbids the use of the Omega force against Caucasians. Something like that.The acting is good, especially Allan Alda as the nudnik president, but little acting is required. As a director Moore gets the job done but doesn't add much. What made Doctor Strangelove exceptional was the realism between the comic moments, the battle scenes for instance. Here, Moore has the Omega force not just running across a field but high stepping, which isn't really as funny as it is silly. (The last man in line trips over a stone and sprains his ankle, hollers out, Save yourselves, and another one runs back and shoots him on the spot.) Moore as a writer turns out to be a more astute humorist than I'd expected him to be. (One Canadian prisoner, in a psycho biker's get-up, is serving his term for trying to use regular gas instead of unleaded.) It has its funny moments.

Never before did such a film sustain such a pace for so long, literally non-stop from start to finish the movie is perfectly paced leading from one crescendo to the next. With each plateau we are given a few short minutes to catch out breath, take stock then move on.

At the end of the day film for the most part is about rewarding it's viewers with something unimaginable and new, different to their daily lives (as with good fiction). Die Hard when it first exploded onto our screens in 1988 was just that. It's hard to imagine just how breathtaking this movie was now because there have not only been two sequels (to date) but also countless rip-offs and 'me too's'. Also for younger cinema audiences this movie is fast becoming 'retro', looking at the styles, themes and mood of the movie it's very much a film about its time (the late eighties). Rolex watches, limos, budgetless multi-national projects, barer bonds - there is a great sense of naivety possibly lost on younger audiences more used to computer crime and situations less tangible (the internet). Back then limos were only chartered by big corporations, Rolex watches really were a sign of status and guns the solution to all problems (as long as yours were bigger than theirs).

Today he'd probably have reached into is pocket and called for help on his mobile phone. Of course as you'll see it's not quite that easy, but even so the advent of mobile telecommunications does make a mockery of a lot of 80s movies. Back then having your phone lines cut in a movie meant two things; 1. there was no way to reach the outside world and this meant whomever cut them now had you prisoner in whichever building you were in at the time. 2. You were probably about to die, or dies trying to make your escape. So why is this movie so good then? Well because in many ways it's comforting to watch. It's like sitting in  a comfortable sofa with a mug of warm tea on winter's night; outside it may be cold and windy but inside you have complete control of your environment.  Die Hard (without giving anything away for new watchers) concludes happily, the bad guys are really bad and the good guys are really good. In short you know where you stand and what to expect.As a male, and like many other males I'm sure being honest about it when I first saw this movie I aspired to be like the hero.

But also because I know what I'm getting. Okay so this movie doesn't make you think in quite the same way as perhaps 'better' more complicated movies do, but should it have to? It lacks the plot twists and sophistication of a lot of modern cinema certainly, it also lacks computer graphics and in my opinion that's no bad thing.

While Parker Posey is known best for playing `quirky yet intelligent' characters, her role seems more of a natural addition in this film rather than a run-of-the-mill portrayal for her.

And Schrieber's portrayal is brilliant and both comedic and heart-breaking in it's subtle profundity.  Schreiber has been on my radar since I saw him in RKO 281 brilliantly portraying one of my personal heroes, Orson Welles, and after viewing this performance I plan to seek out more of his work.  The Daytrippers has been an independent film darling for years now and I can see why.  It is an intelligent, emotional and well-written and acted film that will hold an appeal for most who take the time to view it. --Shelly  ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"9 November 2003","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  First of all let's get one thing straight Amelie is my favorite movie of all time and trust me i've seen many-many movies!!So what is it all about? The movie tells us the story of Amelie from the moment she was conceived (in perhaps the most clever scene i've ever seen) 'till ,well, the present. Amelie lives in a very beautiful world filled with strange people, from her father who never goes out of the house and spends his time building some sort of mausoleum for her deceased mother to the jealous guy at Les Deux Moulins cafe everyone is unique and as far away from normal as you can imagine! Amelie is a waitress in the aforementioned cafe and at she finds pleasure at helping out everyone around her who needs her help and making them happy always in her own way. For example she punishes the grocer for being harsh to his retarted employee and in one of the best scenes i've ever seen she gives a blind man the tour of her neighborhood. But when she falls in love, she is unable to help herself and confess her love to Nino proving that although she tries to make everyone else happy, she doesn't have the guts to take the risk to try and make HERSELF happy.So what makes Amelie stand out? First of all its unique art direction. Everything is simply beautiful, from the streets of Monmarte to the design and decoration of her house everything is beautiful. The scenery combined with the Jean-Pierre's direction and Yan Tierssen's excellent soundtrack give the sense of being in a dream, not an absurd dream like a David Lynch movie but a beautiful from which you would never want to wake up... Then there is Amelie herself... Audrey Tautut is without doubt the most perfect woman. From the way she looks to the way she moves and talks, she is not acting trying to be Amelie,she IS Amelie, it's like the part was written especially for her even though she was selecte among thousands of other actresses... Then there's the direction which is perfect with a lot of clever touches throughout the film (such as showing us her beating heart when she meets Nino or the way the various flashbacks kick in) clearly this movie wouldn't be half as good if it weren't for all these factors plus, the music!! Never have i seen a most suiting soundtrack for a movie. In the end as you've probably assumed every little ellement and detail has been carefully selected, nothing is there by accident and nothing from a street poster to an actor feels like it shouldn't be there.Bottom line is that Amelie is more of an experience than a movie. The story is not original nor exciting but it's the world that it's set in and the way it is told that makes it special. You have to see it for yourselves, or rather experience it, to really understand it. It is art in its purest and most audience friendly form! Don't let the subtitles or the fact that the movie's in French scare you, give it a chance and as the tagline says it may change your lives!!

It's easier to swallow than his muddled post apocalyptic tale of cannibals and weirdos living in a bizarre apartment building, Delicatessen, yet not as overly sentimental and cloyingly sweet as his over-rated and more well known romantic fluff piece, Amelie.  What's not to like about a film where you meet sinister Siamese twins running an orphanage, a talking brain living in a fish tank, an evil midget woman who kidnaps children, and the offspring of a mad scientist who tries to steal the dreams of said children because he himself is incapable of dreaming (and thus has no soul)? All of Jeunet's usual tricks are here fun camera movement that follows certain scenes from the eyes of animals and insects, elaborate set pieces that demonstrate the inner connectedness of all things and how one tiny detail in one small insignificant event can set off a huge domino effect that ends in something of immense significance, and of course a cast of characters who are all misfits, weirdos, or orphans of some sort.  The set designs are fantastic, yet feel a little too similar to stuff we've seen from Terry Gilliam and Lars Von Trier in earlier works (Gilliam's Brazil or The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and Von Trier's Element of Crime or Zentropa come to mind often).  The music score from Angelo Badalamenti (of Lynch fame) is as great as always.  The cast is wonderful (especially the children and the young girl playing Miette).  Unfortunately its all drown out by such washed out colors and darkness.  I get the point Jeunet was trying to make, but with all the light-hearted touches he added in other ways (the little boy belching, the idiocy of the clones) that the film could've used a few visual contrasts. Some brighter lights and brighter colors should have been used in some scenes so as to give the audience's eyes a rest and to coincide with the hopeful fairy tale aspect of it all.  Strangely, his next film, Amelie would be nothing but brightness and color.  Still, for all its flaws, City of Lost Children is a wonderful movie for anyone who loves weird films with lots of interesting visuals, strange characters, and ultimately a good heart.

As agent Doyle enters his office sitting there calmly and looking at a portrait of agent Doyle and his mother that's on his desk is Fenton Meiks, Matthew McConaughey. Asked by Doyle to put the portrait down and tell him what he knows about the God's Hand Killer Fenton tells him that he knows who he is, his younger brother Adam, Jeremy Sumpter, who killed himself earlier that evening. At first Doyle thinks that Fenton is just another person who's trying to get his name in the papers but when he calls the sheriffs office in Thurman, where Fenton says he comes from, he's told that the police are looking for Fenton and want him to return an ambulance that he drove away with his brothers body in it! This shocking an true revelation of Fenton's part makes Doyle think that there's something to what he's is telling him. Hearing him out Fenton begins to tell agent Doyle a story that shocks as well as intrigues him. Back in the summer of 1979 when both Fenton and Adam were little boys being brought up by their father, Bill Paxton, they were awakened on night by Dad Meiks. Dad Meilks told them that he got a vision from an angel that they've been chosen to battle the evil ones on earth and soon the angel will contact Dad Meiks with a list of names of those evil ones that they are to kill. At first Fenton thought that this all was just a bad dream but the next morning when his father drove him and his brother to school and told them not to tell anyone what he said to them last night Fenton realized that it was all real! His father has gone over the deep end and was taking him and his brother Adam with him. After getting a list of the evil ones whom were to be killed from the angel Dad Meiks committed a number of brutal murders which he made the two boys watch. At first Fenton didn't want anything to do with them and tried to get his brother Adam to run away with him from their deranged father. Adam, being younger and more impressionable wanted to stay and help his dad in the stamping out of the evil that's in the world.Fenton goes on with the story of how his father put him in the basement to punish him for not going along with the angel's instructions. Later when his father thought that Fenton was cured of his negative and unholy feelings he took him out to kill one of the evil persons that the angel instructed him to kill. Fenton ending up killing his father instead . Even after his deranged and sick father was gone it seemed that his brother Adam was still carrying out his fathers work until that night when he killed himself. As the rain starts to get heavier Fenton tells agent Doyle that he'll show him where the bodies of the God's Hand Killer are buried to prove that he's telling the truth. Handcuffed Fenton is driven by Doyle to the spot where he was told that the bodies of the killer would be found and what Doyle finds is much more then what he ever expected. Frailty ranks right up there with movies liked Psycho an Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer as one of the most effective as well as disturbing movies about serial killers ever made. The movie is far better then the highly advertised and overrated Silence of the Lambs with the added punch of the murderer indoctrinating his two innocent sons in participating in the crimes. Even more shocking is that Dad Meiks and his sons look and act like they came off the set of Father Knows Best or My Three Sons instead of characters straight out of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or The Hills Have Eyes. That's just how normal and stable they look and act until they go into their murderous rampages. What also hits home about the movie is that Bill Paxton, who directed as well as stared in the movie, gives the unfortunate and helpless victims of Dad Meiks's righteous anger enough screen time to where the audience can see them as human beings instead of props. Like they would be in most horror films like Frailty and you really feel and sympathize for them as the horrible acts in the movie are inflected on them by the Meiks's. Paxton also cut the action short in regards to the killing which makes them more effective then if he lingered on with gallons of gore and slow motion camera work just to shock the audience but at the expense of taking away the humanity of the people that are murdered by cutting down on their screen time just to put in those gory scenes. The movie has an ending that's truly disturbing which you have to see over again to get what the movie is trying to tell you.

Like they would be in most horror films like Frailty and you really feel and sympathize for them as the horrible acts in the movie are inflected on them by the Meiks's. Paxton also cut the action short in regards to the killing which makes them more effective then if he lingered on with gallons of gore and slow motion camera work just to shock the audience but at the expense of taking away the humanity of the people that are murdered by cutting down on their screen time just to put in those gory scenes. The movie has an ending that's truly disturbing which you have to see over again to get what the movie is trying to tell you. Unlike most films with shocks and twists, in Frailty, they fit right in with the story which is why Frailty stands out like it does compared to almost all the murder and horror movies that you see today or that you've seen over the years.

We now have continuous story flow which is indicative of the strength of the original concept. Audiences did not have to put up with some ill &#150; conceived spruced up story which gave an excuse to bring Michael Myers back to the big screen. From an unoriginal perspective, we do have the predictably higher body count. Fortunately it did not reach the levels attained by other sequels within the genre. The other predictable element of this horror sequel is that the death sequences are far more gruesome. Notwithstanding these obligatory elements, the sequel is relatively strong and although not as good as the original, this sequel did much to build on the ominous reputation of Michael Myers.Looking at a sequel is surprisingly interesting. We have the original to compare to and we can access how the characters have developed. In this one, character development was not an issue since we are dealing with a story that follows events directly after the original. This in itself is interesting as we do not see this very often.There are elements that contribute well, but also those that contribute poorly. The ones that contribute well is the soundtrack, the Shape and Donald Pleasance. Elements that did not work well here is unbelievable character decisions, and poor special effects.The music is for me the outstanding element here. The opening theme track seems to be updated with more bass giving a far more &#145;in your face effect'. This is exactly what Michael is. He is no longer an unknown force. Haddonfield knows he is there somewhere in the shadows &#150; lurking, waiting to strike. Therefore the theme does not emphasise the suspense indicative of the original &#150; rather the gruesome intent of the villain. This seems to be more in line with the Halloween festival around the world where the costumes are loud. The movie had become more indicative of it's title.It has been mentioned by other users here that the &#145;Sandman' track is out of place. Although this may seem so on the face of it, I feel that it offers a contrast to the Halloween theme track as a &#145;feel good' track is played and then we are led into the ominous theme track &#150; muck like what would be done at Halloween parties. This sequence of track, probably not intentionally, highlights the way that this story has become synonymous with the festival as previously touched upon. It not only takes the name of Halloween. It takes the character of Halloween. Myers is the evil that never dies &#150; the bogeyman. John Carpenter has created a story that identifies strongly with makes no small contribution. October 31st and has stolen into the ceremony. His music is a prime example of this. The Shape is now played by Dave Warlock. The suspense lacking from the script itself becomes evident in his body language. His movements accentuated his evil presence and dehumanised him. It also shows us that he is not a normal human being - rather a cold, soulless entity that exists only to kill his sister.  This was also evident in the first, but was more noticeable in this movie since we saw more of Myers. The Shape was given more screen time, but his basic character remained true to the original. A necessary keep &#150; over since the sequel deals with the same night the attack started.Donald Pleasance is as much affiliated with &#145;Halloween' as Jamie Lee Curtis is. His major contribution is creating a sense of plausibility for the audience. He recites his lines with such authenticity that the audience will be drawn into the story. We think of the &#145;mad scientists' of an era gone by, only this is not his creation but a shell born onto the world to carry out evil deeds. He is what Alec Guinness was to &#145;Star Wars' and what Vincent Price was to horror movies. Pleasance adds to the aura of Myers and was a vital part of the &#145;Halloween' franchise. Even with Jamie Lee Curtis on board in the most recent &#145;Halloween' movies, the impact of the first two &#145;Halloween' movies was never rekindled which is due in part to the loss of Pleasance. He was a great opponent for Myers.The believability added by the abovementioned members of the cast was undermined by unbelievable character decision making. Curtis is always hiding not far away from Myers. Not rational for somebody who was previously attacked and knows what she is up against. There would have been more plausible solutions to making Curtis more of a helpless victim. She could have injured herself while she was trying to escape and the perfect opportunity for this was in the hospital when she narrowly escaped Myers. What she did, did not assist the story, but weakened it. It is these areas within which audiences drawn in may be lost.The effects were weak in places. The blood drained on the floor was way too red. It served to weaken the movie since this is another element which may jolt audiences from their imagination. Special effects serve to add believability to the story and when attention is drawn to them in a negative sense, the story can only be adversely affected. It was also too much blood for a Myers kill. He strikes a lethal blow rather than causing too much gore. It is unfortunate that this seemingly obligatory element became a part of this movie.I had seen this movie before the original and for some time favoured this one, mostly due to the haunting soundtrack. But I grew to prefer the original because of its suspense. The music, in my opinion, is still better in this sequel since it adds ominous intent to Myers and more truly reflects his character. But this was not enough to improve it over the original and if the weaknesses mentioned above were ironed out, we would have had a much stronger comparison.  What separates &#145;Halloween' from other slasher movies is that Myers has real purpose, although there is no evident motive. He exists solely to kill his sister. Myers does not kill all that are within his territory, but those that may stand in the way of his objective. This is the essence of the story and gives reason for his continued existence. This has now been stopped in the most recent &#145;Halloween' movie &#150; &#145;Halloween Resurrection' and although it is said that this gives way to a new story, it seems to lead it to older stories where the villain kills senselessly. It is true that it had to change in some way, but if Myers is not stalking a relative his core purpose is lost. I am sure that there will be another sequel and I am hoping that they bring back Laurie. The original concept was very good and if the story is going to continue, the foundation should be kept.

And hopefully in the next film  they'll remmeber why we love spidey, as will Tim Burton who didn't bring anything memorable to the film's score.  ","genre":"Action, Adventure"}]
