I don't mean to diss the remake as it is almost a more expensive scene by scene copy (that is lacking in imagination) and he characters were less believable.Not only did Amenábar direct 'Abre Los Ojos', he co-wrote and scored the film (as he did with his debut feature film 'Tesis' and his subsequent films 'The Others' and 'Mar Adentro') which itself is proof of his multiple talent. The execution is effectively simple and minimal as the director relies less on special effects and lavish sets and the result is an authentic look. 'Abre Los Ojos' looks real but at the same time there is a surreal feel to it, a dreamlike feel, as if the viewer is a spectator in the main character's dream. This is exactly how Amenábar succeeds, because he involves the viewer, not only through the character but through the atmosphere he creates.The cinematography and score are superb. The visuals are stunning and the editing is first rate. Amenábar and co-writer Mateo Gil have done an solid job in the writing department.The performances are first rate. Eduardo Noriega effortlessly carries the role. Penelope Cruz and Fele Martínez performs naturally. Najwa Nimri is spellbinding. Chete Lera is very good.Needless to say, I'd definitely recommend people to watch this before 'Vanilla Sky' as the element of suspense is important.

The film takes place in modern day Hollywood.A young woman Rita (Harring) is in a limousine that gets crashed into by a bunch of crazy kids driving and loses her memory. She wanders around the streets of Hollywood until she enters an apartment complex while the residents of the apartment she goes into are leaving. Then the apartment owners niece, Bette (Watts), stays at the apartment hoping to become a movie star. When Bette finds Rita she tries to help her discover who she really is and go around Los Angeles looking for clues. Adam Kesher (Theroux) is a film director and is being forced by some unknown threatening people to cast an actress into the lead role of his new film. Adam is very angry by this and goes home early to discover that his wife is cheating on him with Billy Ray Cyrus. Adam has much bigger problems than that though because he is being followed by some very bad people...The writing by David Lynch for this film is masterful. This film is completely unique and no other writer can write like Lynch. Everything about this crazy, twisted film is pure genius, what I love about it most is the first time that I saw it I was thinking the whole time this movie seems really bad but I can't stop watching because I secretly love it. The complexity of the plot is so complex that no one has even found out how complex it is yet. Just a brilliant script and if you see this film you are either going to love it or hate it. And if you watch it and you like it then it just hasn't sunk in yet that you actually love it.David Lynch's direction is as insane as his writing, and that is obviously a good thing. The shots are absolutely stunning, and this is one of the few films I find addicting. After I watched this film the first time I said to myself I must watch something else of David Lynch's direction. He really knows how to get great performances from his actors, and a lot of people say they are acting poorly but they are supposed to be and they are doing it extremely well.As I said in the last paragraph the acting was really good, but easily the weakest part of the film. Naomi Watts made me love her after seeing this movie because she is just so good the whole way through, I would elaborate more on it but that would kind of give spoilers. Laura Harring was alright, nothing too special though but she wasn't really supposed to be. There was nothing wrong with her performance though but she could have added a little more depth to it. The same really goes for Justin Theroux as well, he did fine but he could have added more. The supporting cast all did great, giving exactly as they were supposed to and supplying a lot of mystery with their performances.Overall I give this film a solid 9\/10. It is a must see for anyone who wants to get their mind bended, much more than this summer's Inception. After you see this film I suggest you see Lynch's Inland Empire which will completely destroy your mind, I still have no clue what that film is even about.

This is one of the defining movies of the French New Wave, which was influenced by the Italian neorealism.The title 'The 400 Blows' might cause some confusion, leading one to believe that it is about corporal punishment or crime. But it's not. While the English language title is a straight translation of the french language title, the meaning is another ball game. The french language title is part of the expression faire les quatre cents coups - which means to raise hell.This french motion-picture is especially significant for its director, as it reflects events of his own life and even his friends's lives. So, it's a semi-autobiographical film (Truffaut saw on the character Antoine Doinel a lot of himself). Besides, the film lets us know the unfair way how juvenile offenders in France were treated back then.The story is about Antoine Doinel, a common teenager in Paris, who is seen by his parents and teachers as annoying and as a rebel. We do feel for him and I'm pretty sure that many of us can (or could once) relate to him at the same age.It's a film which simplicity is all about, with a simple plot and no major surprises. But it's beautifully filmed and done, real, human, sensitive, dramatic and, to a degree, poetic. It is also very convincing in portraying the adolescents's conflicts and crisis of existence. It also demonstrates how times were so different and how people had much more liberty at the time. Completely different of nowadays's pressures which we are so prisoners of.Another beauty of the film is on the settings. Through the adventures of the two kids, it takes us ourselves to the streets of Paris (even if only by screen), without forgetting to mention that the first minutes are an excellent opening, showing images of the heart of the city (as if we were traveling by train, car, motorcycle or even bike), near the Eiffel Tower and even right next to it. On this, I'd like to make a comparison it shows a lot more of Paris than 'Before Sunset'. What a difference, there isn't even comparison! I know they are completely different films, but they both take place in the same city. I always thought that 'Before Sunset' shows very little of Paris. They were lazy on that one. But not with this one.The final part of the film is also especially beautiful, showing Antoine running away to the ocean (which he always wanted to experience), reaching the sea's shoreline, running into it, then turning back to the land. It's as if he is hesitant and at the same time determined to go as far as he can. Then the camera zooms in and freezes his face looking straight to the camera like he is breaking the 4th wall.Jean-Pierre Léaud is great as Antoine Doinel, as well as Patrick Auffay as René Bigey (Antoine's best friend). The kids have the best performances.

All of this together creates a necessarily cerebral product, a film that both requires and repels your attention. With this methodology, Tarkovsky created some of his greatest masterpieces, including Andrei Rublev and Solaris, and it is a methodology that does not exist whatsoever in Hollywood (the closest resemblance might be Gus van Sant's Gerry). Because of this, watching a Tarkovsky film is always a change, a change that I usually welcome.OK, now that that's out of the way, on to the movie. Stalker is a film that stretches the definition of sci-fi and fantasy. The setting very much relies on the viewer's imagination; it is clear that the actors are just parading around the Russian wilderness and a dilapidated country town, but the mood and atmosphere created by the long shots transform these common sceneries into mysterious territories known as The Zone and The Town. The Zone is sanctioned off from the public by the government, but people known as Stalkers guide people through the zone. We watch as one Stalker leads a writer and a scientist through The Zone in search of The Room, a place where your wishes come true. Nothing in the film is given a definite label - descriptors are essentially proper nouns and the world is left too ambiguous for proper definition. This sparseness is actually what gives the film it's strength, because it plays on the exact idea that Tarkovsky is trying to display - a blend of the conscious and subconscious. On their journey to The Room, the characters reveal themselves to us piece by piece, what they desire and what their life means to them, but rarely is it through direct action, and most of the time the camera isn't even focused on them. This leads to a hypnotic composite of fantasy and reality, a confusion of what the character can and cannot control. What we are supposed learn is that our deepest darkest desires always betray what we want. What we witness for our characters is a loss of self and place in a setting that we don't understand.The plot of Stalker could easily be compiled into a 15 minute short and contain the same message, but that would betray the beauty of the film. However, I don't think that Tarkovsky's devices are necessarily to be praised for the film's effectiveness - like I said before, the craft of the movie was simply enough to make a cerebral product that will infect your brain, but the substance leaves a little to be desired. The writing itself is not that great and seemed to be checkered throughout when Tarkovsky felt like something needed to be thrown in. I also can't necessarily affirm that I understood the movie; still, the thought of watching it all again to understand it more fully seems a little too daunting right now. If you do watch it, expect to be tantalized, but not to be blown away.

The movie starts of with an almost horrific tone. The first scene is more dark and ominous than Frankenstein. The cinematography in the movie was really interesting and used effects that I haven't seen in other movies from that time period. For instance, the movie used a lot of really low and really high camera angles, which were pretty cool. I also liked, during the scene when Thatcher was speaking to Kane's parents, how you could see Kane through the window outside playing. It was really cool because you could see how happy he was with his life the way he had it, while at the same time people were planning what would turn out to be an empty, unhappy life. I also thought that how the plot moved forward by jumping around in time through flashbacks was really cool.

It's a strange but interesting movie. It combines suspense and horror in a classic but fascinating way.However, it isn't just some suspense\/horror film. It is very original and unusual. In this motion picture, the birds turn against humans. Apparently, this movie made many people fear the birds after watching it. I don't believe this could happen in real life. I mean, I know that birds can attack when they are messed up with or when they feel threatened but I don't believe they'd attack with no reason, much less entire crowds of birds.Nevertheless, this is what could happen if birds declared war against humankind in real life. The movie is triumphant on this. What it lacks is an explanation. The movie is nearly 2 hours long and it just ends without explaining why did the birds attack people. Was it revenge? Some kind of mental disease or virus? We don't know.While I wouldn't exactly get bird phobia because of this film, it somewhat makes one look at birds differently. I even remember once coming near some construction near the sea and I realized there were a cup of gulls standing on its roof and it was a bit creepy - it made me think of this film, particularly the scene when Melanie is on the school yard sitting on the fence near the playground, smoking a cigarette and we see behind her a bird flying to a jungle gym and then more and more birds show up until the whole playground is full of them.The birds of the film are mostly seagulls, crows and ravens (they're the ones that viciously attack) but there also parakeets (hilariously called lovebirds in the film). The parakeets never do any harm, but they get crazy in some scenes. The film takes place in Bodega Bay, California - which is almost like the apocalypse with all those birds attacks. Many of these birds attacks are impressing, including those which children are attacked at school. Besides, the loud sounds of the birds are brilliant and accent the atmosphere both the sounds of them yelling (they are well know for being noisy birds) and the crazy sounds of them flapping their winds.As for the cast, the best ones are Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels, Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner, Veronica Cartwright as Cathy Brenner and a very attractive Suzanne Pleshette as the teacher Annie Hayworth.This should definitely be on Top 250.

I really need to see this a couple more times to possibly fully understand everything that happens and what everything might have been intended for. movies like this are a lot of work, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing nor necessarily a good thing. I like a movie that makes one think, but I don't like one being forced down my throat as being great art just because I may not see it the way you do. I see there is quite some division with reviewers' responses on this film. A truly bad film would not do that either. So...for form's sake and because some of the film's scenes are very powerful, I will sit on that figurative fence leaning slightly more to good art rather than just mediocre. The director Roeg gets a lot of good credit for his visual artistry from the opening scenes involving the little blonde girl with the red mac to the stain on the stained glass photo to the truly magnificent and haunting views of Venice. Roeg paints his canvas with detail and color. He also overdoes it as well. The lengthy love-making scene for overblown, unnecessary, and a huge detractor from the atmosphere of the film. I kept thinking to myself - My God will this ever end! Roeg's evident skill with a camera lens does not always translate into good story-telling. I have not read the very short Daphne Du Maurier story but know that it and this must be completely different in many regards. Roeg gets us going early with the death of the child and then we have these long, very often poorly transitioned scenes in Venice until things start heating up in the final third. the movie seemed very long though it is just under two hours. It felt like two-and-a-half. That is because Roeg's pace is sometimes catatonic. I, for one, like the pay-off.

I enjoyed Sutherland and Christie in the leads, and I really liked Hilary Mason as the blind sister\/prophet and her Italian-playing an Englishwoman sister Clelia Mantania.

For me the movie never quite captures the pure white heat enjoyment of the greatest Spider-Man stories from Marvel Comics. Raimi never quite gets to grips with the danger and excitement of Spideys world. Whilst the action sequences and special effects are truly awe inspiring, the world in which they are presented feels too much like a high budgeted Power Rangers remake. This is in no small part due to the glossy Production Design by Neil Spisak and the airy, breezy cinematography by Don Burgess. Both commendable by any event movie standards, but at the sake of a translation of a dangerous, fun, darker world that existed in Spider-Man comics since the 60's, 70's, 80's. Tobey Maguire gives a solid, earnest and emphatic performance as peter Parker\/Spider-Man, and im sure for a whole generation Maguire will be the definitive Spider-Man actor. Spidey in this movie, and its two sequels is not the comedian with the heroic side readers of the comics are familiar with, and i think this is a potential problem. Maguire gives a sweet, innocent, driven performance as Peter Parker which clashes with his earnest portrayal as Spider-Man, unfortunately this means the character at times can come across as bland and boring. Willem Dafoe is a great choice to play Green Goblin and he does so with relish, unfortunately they completely messed up The Goblins costume, which in the battle scened with Spider-Man looks like two Action Figures in conflict. It would have been much more interesting to utilise Dafoes already Goblin like features and to have gone down a more Jekyll and Hyde road. Its the revisionist approach to the chronology of the characters that weighs the movie down. Kirsten Dunst is excellent as the girl next door Mary Jane, but it would have been better had they started with a Gwen Stacey as Spidey's first love interest, purely because the origins compared to the comics are somewhat jumbled. Danny Elfmans theme is completely uninspired, it recycles elements of his own Batman\/The Flash\/Darkman themes and is over lush and melodramatic, failing musically to capture the danger and excitement of Peter Parker\/Spider-Mans world. For an origin story, Sam Raimi really sets up the character and story arc well. But its tantalising to think just how amazing this movie could have been, so its with excitement i look forward to 2012's Andrew Garfield starring\/Marc Webb directed Spider-Man reboot, which promises to capture a real flavour of the best Spider-Man stories.

It's not because it is in black and white. There are great movies in black and white that have aged with great dignity, such as Ted Tetzlaff's 'The Window'.There is no denying that 'King Kong' must have been an innovative film in its day. I guess in 1933 people had never seen anything quite like this before and were amazed. Well, in 1925 they already had a great surprise with 'The Lost World', which this one has much in common with. But this one went even farther thanks to the introduction of sound (and what a sound!) and even more difficult animation. This also has got a bit of 'Beauty and the Beast', as King Kong (the great gorilla) seems to fall in love with Fay Wray's character.King Kong looks so phony but his roars still give chills. Not to mention that it is more fierce than you might expect for a movie this old. One of the best effects is when King Kong climbs the Empire State Building and reaches its top (and the scenes with planes).But for nowadays standards it just doesn't work. Besides, while it was a good film for the early 1930's, it is boring now. And the bits with the natives nearly made me fall asleep of boredom.Actors were okay in their roles. Fay Wray was great in her role (generally likable) and she was pretty but her constant loud scream is a little too much. The Driscoll character was a bit of an irony, as he speaks like that about all women and yet he falls in love with Fay Wray's character.With all due respect to its fans, but this movie did very little for me.

A man and a woman are thrown together by circumstance take an instant dislike to each other, and yet it is immediately obvious to us that they are made for each other. What follows is simply the fun and games they go through before they realise it themselves. It seems that the closer a screwball follows that pattern and the more it makes those elements work, the better it is.Bringing Up Baby is a perfect example, although rather daringly it pushes the antagonism between the leads further than ever before. With this wild and witty screenplay by Hagar Wilde and Dudley Nichols, it's not simply a case of personality clash. Katherine Hepburn's character is a genuine disaster area, leaving a trail of destruction behind her that puts her on a par with Harpo Marx. And like Harpo, she has that quality that means she would be infuriating in real life, but is instantly likable on screen. Cary Grant, as a relatively regular and rational man, ought to be the character we sympathise with, and yet it's delightful watching him getting wound up by Hepburn's antics. A real turning point occurs in the story when we realise Hepburn is falling in love with him. She suddenly becomes our heroine because we want her to gloriously sabotage his wedding to the frumpy Virginia Walker, and we'll enjoy watching her do it.Of course a lot of this likability and chemistry comes from the actors. Hepburn had occasionally demonstrated a flair for comedy in her earlier films, but never before had she been able to really throw herself into such an oddball creation. The trick to her appeal here is the way she uses her typical Hepburn sophistication to make it look like she knows what she's doing which, along with her impeccable comic timing, makes it all the funnier when things fall apart around her. Grant on the other hand does a perfectly styled reasonable-man-driven-loopy act, his reactions crazed, but no more so than situations he finds himself in, meaning he is both funny and believable. The fact that we can laugh so much at these two tussling makes us want them to become an item.The extra factor here is director Howard Hawks, who had a great touch with comedy. Importantly, Hawks doesn't cut into the scene with two many close-ups or angle changes, generally keeping all the characters in the shot at once in long takes, so that everything is just allowed to play out before us. Whenever he does focus on one character, you know the moment is really important. This is not to say Hawks doesn't pay attention to the intricacies of shot composition. He has a great use of space especially when it comes to the eponymous leopard. Whenever Baby is about to appear, Hawks often has a conspicuously empty spot for him to walk into, for example when he sits down next to Barry Fitzgerald. Earlier, when Grant first encounters him, the leopard is already in shot in the foreground. These brilliant entrances are all the funnier for how Hawks arranges them, in what is a kind of visual and spatial equivalent of comic timing.What's perhaps best about Bringing Up Baby is that it is almost continuously funny. I'm reminded again of the Marx brothers, who a few years earlier saved the talkie comedy by showing that verbal wit that could be just as madcap as slapstick. With its overlapping dialogue and dialogue running alongside action Bringing Up Baby is a fast-moving and witty treat, with barely a quiet moment in it. It proves that contrary to what many modern critics and filmmaker manuals say, this isn't a purely visual medium and actions don't always speak louder than words.Sadly Bringing Up Baby was not received well in its day.

The totally obvious Alien rip-off is technically surprisingly well executed and pleases with almost top notch set designs and very good creature effects. Now that all this didn't make an absolutely satisfying, or actually even really good sci-fi movie can be blamed on the lack of tight pacing in the script, occasionally bad editing or I guess generally the rather inconsistent lead of George P. Cosmatos, resulting uncalled-for moments of amateur filmmaking entering into a movie otherwise to be taken serious. These then start accumulating and gradually getting out of control as the movie gains speed (among others resulting conversations on the subjects of popcorn and puzzles) and then ultimately explode into a 5 minute orgy of total C-Movie crap, actually even added after the anyways forgettable climax of the movie (how the hell did that happen by the way?).

There's been grumbling from film buffs that Costner's triumph was undeserved, that Martin Scorsese's gangster epic, Goodfellas, should have won, with Scorsese taking the director prize, and there's been a tendency to sneer at Costner's directorial debut ever since. If the Academy was turned off by Goodfellas's violence and misanthropic characters, they could feel safe voting for Dances With Wolves since it seemed more noble, in the same vein as Gandhi. As Kevin Costner's Calvary officer makes peace with an Indian tribe and they welcome him into their fold, it speaks well of the human race, certainly more so than Ray Liotta talking fellow mobster Robert DeNiro out of whacking a fellow hoodlum. Dances With Wolves has its villains, all of them white U.S. calvary soldiers, whose anti-Indian actions make them racists, and, therefore, deserving of the audience's hatred.Native American issues were big at the time, thanks in part to the critical and popular success of Forrest Carter's The Education of Little Tree, a memoir of the author's childhood as the member of a Cherokee tribe that continued to be popular long after Carter was exposed as Asa Carter, a pro-segregationist former Klansman and speechwriter for Alabama governor George Wallace, and definitely not a Cherokee. A true Native American author, Sherman Alexie, was also making a mark at this time with such novels as Reservation Blues. In short, Costner's feel-good epic was the right movie at the right time, very appealing to audiences, who made it a several hundred million dollar grosser, and the Academy, who could vote for it and feel as though they were finally addressing the grievances that Marlon Brando introduced when declining his Oscar for The Godfather 18 years earlier in protest of Hollywood's treatment of Indians in all those John Ford westerns.I avoided Dances With Wolves for years, having dismissed it as politically correct, New Age slop in a pretty package. I finally caught up with it in 2006 and was impressed. Slow moving and rather boring at times, especially when Costner reads from his diary in a monotone that would have gotten him kicked out of any high school drama class, it is nonetheless an extraordinary achievement overall, with lovely cinematography and a John Barry score that's already a classic. When it comes, the action is well-staged, particularly a buffalo stampede, and the Indian's attack on the Calvary troop that has taken Costner hostage. There's a lot of mystical nonsense, including the shot of a wolf howling from a cliff, but it's moving regardless, especially set to Barry's majestic score.Although it's often classified as a western, Dances With Wolves is more of an historical epic, though a fictional one. I don't think it deserved the Oscar over Goodfellas, but it was far more deserving of that prize than many other films that the Academy has honored through the years, and Costner gambled with his career to make it.Brian W.
