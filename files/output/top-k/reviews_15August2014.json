The first two Death Wish movies kept the body count relatively low, mainly because having an aging Charles Bronson fight and kill an entire army of street punks would just be stupid. But then the third one came around and they figured screw it, let's do that anyway. From this part on they're just going for the so-dumb-it's-entertaining feel, and I've got to say they're succeeding. Infinitely more violent and infinitely less shocking than it's predecessors, Death Wish 3 is basically one cartoonish action set piece after the other. The logics of this movie universe also never cease to amaze me. How would a bulletproof vest protect you from a stabbing? How on Earth can you order a missile launcher through mail order (I know it's America, but still)? Why doesn't he bother to use said missile launcher until there's barely anyone left standing, wasn't the entire point of buying it to kill a lot of thugs at once? Do you really need to bring an unarmed guy with you to a battle with hundreds of street punks just so he could carry along your ammo? Why does everyone who gets shot fall in the wrong direction? Do street gangs really have a hotline to order more guys if a battle is going down? I really didn't know they stuck together so well. Death Wish is a ridiculous B-movie, but it's a mighty fine ridiculous B-movie. It's a unique experience, just don't expect anything that made the first two into classics.

It's hard to say what it is, from the amount of fun these products introduced and how much feeling we put into them the more we played. Yeah, I remember having a ball playing with Transformers and He-Man. All the same, toys have bought out the best positive qualities in us, but most importantly life itself.I'm probably going to be in the minority on this but I think this is an under the radar gem. This film in a way is sort of a Roald Dahl tale but for adults. Like in that author's stories he puts fairy tales into the modern world.The visuals and production value of the film are just amazing, because their all practical and were done on a high budget which I'll say is money that was well spent. They really did a great job at making the world in the film seem one step in the realm of fantasy but also one step in our contemporary reality. There are so many moments of visual joy, I don't want to give too many of them away. Two of my favorites set pieces of visual are one with a house that acts like a pop up book from the way it opens. But my favorite in the scene with the walls closing in where its pretty much a 3D crossword puzzle, where there are different sections in different configurations coming out and coming together.The music score from one of my favorite composers Hans Zimer is great and I personal thing this film has one of the best and most underrated scores\/soundtracks. Two of my favorite music tracks in the one in the final conflict and the other was when Leland Zemo gives a speech about his master plan as there were fireworks blazing.But most importantly what powers the film is the story and characters, which I feel is imaginative and has a lot of heart. Even like the humor, though I wouldn't say it's always ha ha funny, after all this film is more of a fantasy, thriller, drama which I'll admit is a great combination and shows that you can do more with the fantasy genre.Supporting characters are really great, Joan Cusack as Alsatin Zevo is great, her character reminds me a little of Mabel from the TV show Gravity Falls like Mabel she is bright cheerful but really odd. And we of course near the end discover why she a bit out of sorts.Robin Wright is solid as Gwen Tyler. She's kind of the straight one but she has a bit of a quarky humorous side to her that comes out a bit more as she interacts with Leslie more. I really like the chemistry between both the characters, it really feels like both were kinda made for one another. Though the only bad thing is both don't have enough scenes together, which to me is the only weak point of the film.And of course the main protagonist, Robin Williams one of my favorite comedians and actors is great in this film which is part of why this is one of my favorite films with him and I really like his character Leslie Zevo. His character is pretty much a man child, he's a lot of fun, has a great odd kinda quarky sense of humor. I really love how inventive the the gags and toys he creates like a smoking jacket or magnetic deviled egg. If the character has a weakness is simply just that he's a man child which makes him unsure of himself and unable to take complete responsibility, and he's aware of this. This is part of what makes us want him to win, we know that he is the rightful owner of Zevo toys but he has to prove himself worthy first, he's got to learn to step up and take it. The antagonist Lt. General Leland Zevo played well by Michael Gambon. Yeah I've seen the Harry Potter films though I remember him best in a Doctor Who Christmas special. Anyway Leland is a solid and even scary villain, he's pretty much a power mad general. One scene which really justifies how far off the reservation he's gone is when Leland is playing some tank video game and he is constantly shooting the UN trucks and just madly enjoying himself. That scene was great because it showed two things; one a simplistic suttle way of showing the depth of an antagonist damaged psyche, which I thing is great because it presents how dangerous the antagonist is. Two, showing the video games don't cause people to do acts of violence, the perpetrators that played the games were crazy to begin with.Leland's plot I'll admit is frighteningly plausible and really scary if you think about it. With the drone technology we have now, whose to say some higher up won't think of pulling strings to make it happen, tricking kids into thinning their playing a video game when their actually destroying real cars and people with these drones. It's an evil plan because not just is it turning kids into killers but it's murdering their innocence. This all the more makes you want the protagonists to win, this evil plan that shouldn't succeed but it's also a fight for the right of innocence to live.This film I think has a great message on the importance of letting the positive beautiful things in life like love, laughter, joy prevail over the negative aspects greed, power, and war.Like any toy to play with this film is a joy to play with.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"15 August 2014","score":"","review":" Toys have always carried a certain power on us as children.

Everyone knows the story, characters, music, magic, fun, etc. This is a very memorable movie because again everyone knows the movie very well. The movie is based on L. Frank Baum's book, and there had been many adaptations for The Wizard of Oz which it was during the silent film era; so I guess you can say if the movie that I'm reviewing is somewhat like a remake of the original silent movies or not. I know that the movie had went many production changes along with the original director Richard Thorpe getting fired for lacking the movie's spirit. So now that we have what Dorothy Gale looks along with the Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion, and the Wicked Witch of the West. Also, Victor Fleming taking over the director's chair for making such a wonderful looking movie, and making OZ look beautiful in Technicolor. I do know that he did not direct the Kansas scenes because of his commitment to work on another production from MGM studio's Gone With The Wind, which I never saw and don't know if I should see it. Maybe I should but I still don't know because I felt that movie stole the Oscar for Best Picture for not letting The Wizard of Oz win, but I digress. As I was saying about the Kansas scenes, they were pretty much much filmed by King Vidor. With that said, I thought the cast were perfect, and they do manage to bring their roles to life. Judy Garland is Dorothy Gale and she will always be remembered for playing that kind of role. Ray Bolger was fantastic as the Scarecrow along with Jack Haley as the Tin Man and Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion. Margaret Hamilton does a memorable job to played the evil Wicked Witch of the West. The production design in this movie are sensational, and it does look a place where anyone fantasize in their own world away from their home. The cinematography is beautifully well shot for OZ being filmed in Technicolor, and the Kansas scenes being filmed in a Sepia tone. The special effects in this movie are quite special for the used of matte paintings; witch being melted; holographic head of the Wizard of Oz; and most of all the tornado. The tornado itself looks really good before there was any CGI by today's special effects. The movie Twister from 1996 does used CGI for the Tornado, while this movie was all done practically. The songs in this movie are indeed memorable such as We're off to see the Wizard; If I only had a Brain; If I only had a Heart; If I only had the Nerve; and everyone's favorite Over the Rainbow. The movie never gets tiring, and anyone can watch this movie as much as they want to because the movie's premise along with the pacing goes by very well. I wish I can say more about this movie, but everyone who has seen this movie had already said about what makes this movie so special. As of that, they are very much right. After this movie was made, there were more OZ movies that appear on the big screen as The Wiz based on its play which it is not a good movie and never saw the play. Also, there were two more OZ movies that were made by Disney such as Return of Oz and Oz the Great and Powerful. Those were good movies, but none of them were as good as the original timeless classic. The Wizard of Oz is never going to die, and it will live on forever. This is a film for all ages for both children and adults. As Dorothy would say There is no place like, to me I say There is no great OZ movie like this one.

Ray Bolger was fantastic as the Scarecrow along with Jack Haley as the Tin Man and Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion. Margaret Hamilton does a memorable job to played the evil Wicked Witch of the West. The production design in this movie are sensational, and it does look a place where anyone fantasize in their own world away from their home. The cinematography is beautifully well shot for OZ being filmed in Technicolor, and the Kansas scenes being filmed in a Sepia tone. The special effects in this movie are quite special for the used of matte paintings; witch being melted; holographic head of the Wizard of Oz; and most of all the tornado. The tornado itself looks really good before there was any CGI by today's special effects. The movie Twister from 1996 does used CGI for the Tornado, while this movie was all done practically. The songs in this movie are indeed memorable such as We're off to see the Wizard; If I only had a Brain; If I only had a Heart; If I only had the Nerve; and everyone's favorite Over the Rainbow. The movie never gets tiring, and anyone can watch this movie as much as they want to because the movie's premise along with the pacing goes by very well. I wish I can say more about this movie, but everyone who has seen this movie had already said about what makes this movie so special. As of that, they are very much right. After this movie was made, there were more OZ movies that appear on the big screen as The Wiz based on its play which it is not a good movie and never saw the play. Also, there were two more OZ movies that were made by Disney such as Return of Oz and Oz the Great and Powerful. Those were good movies, but none of them were as good as the original timeless classic. The Wizard of Oz is never going to die, and it will live on forever. This is a film for all ages for both children and adults. As Dorothy would say There is no place like, to me I say There is no great OZ movie like this one. I give The Wizard of Oz a perfect 10 out of 10.

What do you suppose it is?After having surprised and shocked audiences with Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock followed it up with another horror film, The Birds, which is more straightforward and generic than the rest of his films, but he still did experiment quite a bit with some elements here. There are no surprises or unexpected twists in The Birds and it pretty much plays out as a standard thriller slowly building the suspense by introducing us to the characters so we can identify with them. He didn't use psychological suspense either like he did in so many of his films, he just let the narrative unfold gradually. This may sound like a standard horror film, but what Hitchcock experiments with here is the lack of a musical score to accompany the film. Most thrillers rely on eerie scores to help set the mood, and we know Hitchcock included them often such as in films like Vertigo and Psycho, but here rather than introducing music he uses the sound of birds to scare audiences. Many people complain that the effects are outdated, but it didn't bother me at all, I thought they were really well done and I felt the tension during some of these scenes that have become classic by now (such as the scene where Tippi Hedren's character is trapped inside a phone booth as the birds are attacking the town, and the climatic scene where the birds are surrounding Rod Taylor's home). Those were memorable scenes full of tension, but I did have some issues with the pacing of the story. Hitchcock made sure we cared for the characters and during the first hour of the film he spends time building a possible romantic relationship between Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren. This is where I wished the main characters were played by more charismatic actors such as James Stewart and Kim Novak where the chemistry between them would seem stronger, and that would have engaged me more with a story I kind of felt was silly otherwise. The premise is kind of out there since I really never believed the threat of the birds nor felt their presence haunting, but Hitchcock still managed to build in a few scares despite it all. The bay near San Francisco where this film mostly takes place was a perfect setting and I actually enjoyed the fact that it took place in an enclosed space like this. It sort of made the audience believe these characters were enclosed and surrounded by the birds. Hitchcock can build suspense out of nearly anything and despite my disbelief of the birds being a real threat there were times I did feel that tension. The way in which he exchanges shots from one scene to the next like he did in the phone booth with exterior shots exchanged with interior ones really helps build the suspense and create a tense atmosphere. The Birds may not have much psychological depth, but it plays out quite well as a generic disaster film and slowly builds its way up to a rather interesting climatic scene (I mean switch the birds for zombies and you realize where George A. Romero may have got his ideas for Night of the Living Dead). The Birds isn't amongst my favorite Hitchcock films, but I still had a fun time with it.

Scenes such as the final ambush and the mountain top show down really stand out and will impress film lovers. The Last Of The Mohicans is more than likely remembered as a classic because of this second half that really makes up for the first. To start off with, this film has some great performances. It seems that everyone gives it their all, stand outs being Daniel Day-Lewis and Wes Studi. Everyone is believable and really works. The visuals are also pretty great. Lots of beautiful foliage and rivers that are appealing to the eye. There's also a great deal of work put into the costumes and what not, giving the whole film a very Barry Lyndon feeling, where you start to feel like your actually seeing people from that time period as opposed to people in costumes on set, which is a huge compliment. The soundtrack is also really great, and enhances every scene that it's used in. My main issue with the film is that the first half can be slightly slow and boring. Yes, there is character development, which is needed to make the second half better, but I just found myself in and out of interest with the first half. I wish the whole film could have been as strong as the second half was, but oh well.Overall, this is a historical film that is quite well done.

My appreciation has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I was well into adulthood when I saw 1985's Friday the 13th Part V A New Beginning on TV one night in the early 2000s. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods, which naturally stirs fond youthful memories (not that I'm that old); the presence of a lunatic unstoppable killer &#x97; who increasingly becomes an infernal monster &#x97; just adds an air of danger and suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end. It's the camp-like settings of most of the series and the unstoppable malevolent force that is Voorhees -- Jason, his mother, or anyone under his diabolic spell -- that especially sets Friday the 13th apart from similar franchises.The first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the franchise introduced a campy element with Part III, which pretty much plagues the rest of the series with the exception of maybe Part IV, Part VII and the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway.Released in 1989, Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan is a nice change of pace as the series was suffering from banality at this point; the previous two installments and Part IV are prime examples (people complain about Part V but at least it had an interesting new kind of story with Tommy Jarvis going to the halfway house in the woods seeking succor for his psychological trauma, etc.). Not that I dislike those entries, but the basic Friday formula was getting tired and they needed to try something new. Part VII tried something new with the Carrie-like protagonist, and that entry has a great finale, but it was hampered by a subpar cast of women and forgettable dramedy. Part VIII changes things up by switching the normal location of Crystal Lake (and surrounding area) to a ship going to Manhattan with a group of high school kids and adults aboard. Of course, Jason also gets on board and starts systematically wiping out the youths. A handful of them make it to Manhattan, but so does Jason! I have to admit to enjoying the different settings of Part VIII. The story is split into four parts The prologue takes place on Crystal Lake and features Jason's resurrection -- a great opening. The brief first act takes place on the shore of Crystal Lake with the youths and adults boarding the ship. The long second act takes place on the ship and the final act involves the surviors on a lifeboat and their adventures in Manhattan chased by Jason.Jensen Daggett stands out as the heroine Rennie and places as one of my top 3 or 4 Friday girls. Peter Mark Richman is also notable as Rennie's peculiar stepdad and Scott Reeves as Rennie's sort-of boyfriend.Sharlene Martin is a highlight as Tamara and the filmmakers show off her curves, but she's so devious that she's a turn-off despite her good looks. Kelly Hu is also on hand.The main complaint I hear about this entry is that it's called Jason Takes Manhattan but only the final act takes place in the city. This criticism never made any sense to me as the film spends more than enough time in the big city, at least 35 minutes. The fact that the entire second act occurs on the ship keeps the movie from being one-dimensional.One thing that spoils the continuity and believability of the series is that this installment reveals that Crystal Lake isn't really just a small lake with camps and houses sporadically scattered around it; it's actually some kind of inlet since cruise ships can dock there and go out to sea -- why sure! Interestingly, Jason's facial F\/X (shown at the end) aren't as good as the previous two installments, but they're serviceable.As far as locations go, Part VIII was shot in Vancouver & Britannia Beach, British Columbia; Los Angeles (the alley way & warf scenes); and Times Square, Manhattan (the ending).Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some slightly chilling aspects, some of the others as well, but &#x97; with the exception of the 2009 reboot &#x97; I don't find these movies particularly scary, although they have loads of jump scares. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not very scary, for me anyway. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes.BOTTOM LINE Part VIII is a worthy entry in the series and is notable for trying something new by placing the main cast in a cruise ship environment and the big city, plus Jensen Daggett is a highlight as the female protagonist.

Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway.Released in 1989, Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan is a nice change of pace as the series was suffering from banality at this point; the previous two installments and Part IV are prime examples (people complain about Part V but at least it had an interesting new kind of story with Tommy Jarvis going to the halfway house in the woods seeking succor for his psychological trauma, etc.). Not that I dislike those entries, but the basic Friday formula was getting tired and they needed to try something new. Part VII tried something new with the Carrie-like protagonist, and that entry has a great finale, but it was hampered by a subpar cast of women and forgettable dramedy. Part VIII changes things up by switching the normal location of Crystal Lake (and surrounding area) to a ship going to Manhattan with a group of high school kids and adults aboard. Of course, Jason also gets on board and starts systematically wiping out the youths. A handful of them make it to Manhattan, but so does Jason! I have to admit to enjoying the different settings of Part VIII. The story is split into four parts The prologue takes place on Crystal Lake and features Jason's resurrection -- a great opening. The brief first act takes place on the shore of Crystal Lake with the youths and adults boarding the ship. The long second act takes place on the ship and the final act involves the surviors on a lifeboat and their adventures in Manhattan chased by Jason.Jensen Daggett stands out as the heroine Rennie and places as one of my top 3 or 4 Friday girls. Peter Mark Richman is also notable as Rennie's peculiar stepdad and Scott Reeves as Rennie's sort-of boyfriend.Sharlene Martin is a highlight as Tamara and the filmmakers show off her curves, but she's so devious that she's a turn-off despite her good looks. Kelly Hu is also on hand.The main complaint I hear about this entry is that it's called Jason Takes Manhattan but only the final act takes place in the city. This criticism never made any sense to me as the film spends more than enough time in the big city, at least 35 minutes. The fact that the entire second act occurs on the ship keeps the movie from being one-dimensional.One thing that spoils the continuity and believability of the series is that this installment reveals that Crystal Lake isn't really just a small lake with camps and houses sporadically scattered around it; it's actually some kind of inlet since cruise ships can dock there and go out to sea -- why sure! Interestingly, Jason's facial F\/X (shown at the end) aren't as good as the previous two installments, but they're serviceable.As far as locations go, Part VIII was shot in Vancouver & Britannia Beach, British Columbia; Los Angeles (the alley way & warf scenes); and Times Square, Manhattan (the ending).Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some slightly chilling aspects, some of the others as well, but &#x97; with the exception of the 2009 reboot &#x97; I don't find these movies particularly scary, although they have loads of jump scares. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not very scary, for me anyway. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes.BOTTOM LINE Part VIII is a worthy entry in the series and is notable for trying something new by placing the main cast in a cruise ship environment and the big city, plus Jensen Daggett is a highlight as the female protagonist. It's actually better than the previous installment and Part III. The film runs 100 minutes.GRADE B- ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"15 August 2014","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Apparently it took a second viewing for me to really appreciate this film. The first time around I must have been distracted to the point of being inattentive and today I'm glad I gave it another shot. What particularly struck me this time was the gorgeous cinematography, which hooks you right from the start with the menacing ride of the bandit clan upon the seemingly deserted village. Though filmed in black and white, the images are crisp and clean, elevating the result to a true work of art. In fact, the effect is hypnotic at times, and one must concentrate to stay with the story that unfolds.Thinking back on my first experience with the picture, I tried to figure out what might have prevented my viewing pleasure. Yes the film is long and there is a tendency for Kurosawa to keep the camera stationary for an inordinate length of time to establish mood and a point of view. Perhaps it also had something to do with the motion of the villagers who appear to react erratically, almost as if they were self consciously forcing their activity. Now obviously those elements have not gone away, but it's just that I saw it all in a different light with this viewing.Director Kurosawa does take his time building to the action. The entire first half of the film is used to introduce his characters and set up the framework for defending the village. When the village is finally assaulted by the marauding bandits, the samurai follow a methodical plan devised by their leader Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura), whereby one or two of the outlaws are allowed entry into the village while the rest are kept at bay, allowing the villagers to defeat their foes systematically and decisively. The villagers resemble a swarm of bees each time they descend on a fallen enemy.Through a diverse mix of personalities and temperaments, Kurosawa explores various character traits of the samurai, among them honor, loyalty, selflessness, courage and even humor. The comic relief offered by Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune) when attempting to ride the horse for the first time came just at the right moment to break the unrelenting tension faced by the warriors. Kurosawa even delves into matters of the heart with the relationship of Katsushiro and Shino, unfavorably received by the obsessive behavior of Shino's father.All in all, I'm glad I gave this picture a second chance. Seven Samurai is a masterfully told story and a cinematic achievement, and will certainly warrant another viewing in due course.

Leonard Rosenman's music captures the 50s beautifully- just like the film's atmosphere does- as well, while the dialogue is thoughtful, treats the subject matter sympathetically without over-idealising and still packs a punch.

They take a simple premise and slowly pull it apart until we have something beautiful to watch. It's dramatic, it's funny, it's sad. The writers make us relate and the actors make us believe in equal measure.The BadWhile the writers work the premise well, there are moments that are somewhat predictable. We know where the film is going and have worked out early on how it will end. They gave us great moments of drama, but no big twists in the story, it is very linear and i never felt like the route of the film would change. Also I felt it ended a whisker early. One more shot would have ended it well. The UglyThis is nit picking by now, but William's introduction followed the rather cheesy and much used line Well there is one more!. This line wasn't needed. We knew Williams was coming and such an important character deserved a non cliché'd welcome.

Bill Murray plays TV weatherman Phil Connors, an egotistical cynic full of frustrated ambition who, much to his annoyance, finds himself having to broadcast from small-town Punxsutawney PA on the annual Groundhog Day festival. This is the last thing a big star weatherman like Connors wants to be doing, but in spite of his best efforts to get it over before the incoming storm front, things don't really work out as planned the big-city sophisticate is forced to live out the same day again and again in a place he really doesn't want to be, Small Town USA, full of hicks from the sticks.The central mystery of the repeating day is never explained. We don't have time to ponder this as the well-paced script moves briskly along, giving Murray the perfect stage to display his deadpan comic talents. The supporting cast is excellent, particularly Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot as Larry the cameraman. Often, the humour gives way to pathos and some deeply touching (if not to say disturbing) reflections on life, as the perceptive and subtle love story at the heart of the film reveals itself.No matter how many times you see Groundhog Day (it frequently pops up in TV schedules and believe me, you will watch it a lot), you still laugh at the old jokes, notice new jokes that you previously missed, find Andie MacDowell increasingly attractive, Bill Murray funnier and funnier. As time goes by, with each repeated viewing, it is acquiring the mythic charm of something like It's a Wonderful Life, a movie with which it shares some curious thematic parallels. I get the feeling that it really wasn't planned that way, that the project started out as quite an 'ordinary', low budget vehicle for Bill Murray, but somehow had depth and greatness thrust upon it. Again, very much like the story of It's a Wonderful Life.And afterwards that repeating day starts to bother you again. What does it mean? Something about reincarnation? A blueprint for raised consciousness? A biting satire on modern life? Perhaps, as Phil Connors, in his deep, serious mode might say, you realise we are all trapped in our own little versions of Groundhog Day, and if things don't seem to get much better, nor do we get much happier, maybe with a bit of luck, we get a little wiser.

The show was about a very rural, and country family, who strike oil on there land, become immensely wealthy, and move out to the big city in California. Basically, it was a fish out of water story. However, the problem with this TV to movie adaptation is this What works in a TV show, won't work in a movie. You can't have a movie run on just one premise! A film's plot requires much more than that. The plot of the film is this a sleazy con-man finds out about The Clampett's massive fortune, and he and his girlfriend devise a plan to steal all of their money, and The Clampetts and their friends must stop them. I really don't need to say anything else, because that's all that goes on in this movie. The plot is nothing new, and as a matter of fact, this movie, The Addams Family, and Addams Family Values have the exact same plot! many of the jokes are flat, and unfunny. Not to mention, the film is as predictable as can be. It's a shame how the movie turned out. Especially considering how extremely talented the cast is! Jim Varney, Diedrich Bader, Erika Eleniak, Dabney Coleman, Lea Thompson, and Rob Schneider, all give very good performances. The film fails, because of its weak script, and rehashed plot. Despite all its flaws however, I will give the film a few positive accolades The cameo with Buddy Ebsen (Who was the original Jed Clampett by the way.) was very funny. But most of all, the film did not make a mockery of what the original series was, nor did the film parody the original show. Which many TV- to-film remakes do. I'm very thankful that the writer\/writers and director chose not to go with either of those options, and I tip my hat to them for that! So, here's what it all comes down to Is The Beverly Hillbillies a bad film? No. Is it a great film? No. It had a lot of potential to be a great film, but it suffered from very poor writing. The best thing that I can say about this film, is that out of all the recent TV-to-film remakes, this one is the least bad. None of the TV-to-film remakes have ever come close to capturing the spirit or magic of the original series, and this film failed as well, but I must give credit to this film for actually trying.
