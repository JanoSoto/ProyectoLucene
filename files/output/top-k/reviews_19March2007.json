There's John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance; Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch; Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven to name but three. However, for me the best of all these is Leone's masterpiece Once Upon a Time in the West. It is also my favourite of all Leone's pictures.Leone had always been a director who packed his films with atmosphere, style and rhythm, but here he organises every single element to create one overwhelming mood. Everything in the film is geared towards reminding us of death, of a time coming to an end. The pace is slow and measured &#150; Leone really takes his time in telling the story. The buildings are rickety and creaking, many of the minor characters and extras are old and look worn out, and the wind howls across the open spaces.Symbolism is everywhere in this film. Jill and the railway both represent the death of the west. The coming of the railway of course literally heralded the end of an era, but Leone also had a rather strange theory that this time was also the beginning of a matriarchy in America &#150; so women also represent change. Jill and the railway are often synonymous. Jill arrives on the train. The train is black and so is Jill's dress. In contrast, most of the characters are dressed in browns and yellows, matching the landscape of the open plains. The railway magnate is called Morton &#150; mort as in death. Another very subtle touch is that most of the movement is towards or away from the camera. Jill and the train are the only things regularly seen moving from side to side across the frame, as if they are the only ones really going anywhere.The flipside to this atmosphere of death is that it is tinged with the hope of rebirth and progress. This is represented by the recurrent water motif, as water symbolises life. The train needs water to run, and the Sweetwater ranch will provide a watering stop. Jill likes to bath frequently, and later she brings water to the railway workers. Jill is a survivor, and she and Sweetwater represent hope for the future.While Harmonica, Frank and Jill have been analysed to death elsewhere, the character of Cheyenne I feel is often overlooked. Although he rarely drives the plot along and could have been edited out of the story without changing much, he is really central to the tone of the film. He more than any other single character represents the old west. He is tough and rugged on the exterior, but gradually his façade is stripped away to reveal a tired, middle-aged man who just wants to settle down. He is the most real, the most human character, and the one given the most depth. Jason Robard's performance has also come in for a lot of flak, but I think he's perfect for the role &#150; he does that forlorn look very well.Ennio Morricone's music here continues to evolve alongside Leone's style. The score of Once Upon a Time in the West is not as rousing or listenable as the music from the Dollars Trilogy, but it perfectly mirrors that sad and weary tone. The Leone-Morricone trademark of giving each character their own musical theme is even more firmly stated here. It's particularly clever how the theme for the final confrontation mixes Harmonica's and Frank's themes. Leone and Morricone also worked together to make use of natural sound to create atmosphere, something which up to this point had only really been explored by Alfred Hitchcock (most memorably in The Birds, but I'm also thinking of the use of sound in his 1930's pictures). In the opening scene, the creaking of the windmill, the chattering of the telegraph machine and a number of other noises take the place of a musical backing.If there is anything wrong at all with Once Upon a Time in the West, it's that it takes either repeated viewings are extreme concentration to take in every minor plot point and understand every character motivation. The dialogue is sparse, and often more for effect than to give information. There are many short cuts in the narrative and very little is made obvious, so most of the time you have to join the dots yourself to work out exactly what is going on in each scene. There are two pieces I find people get confused about most often, so I'll give my explanations here. Firstly, why Harmonica tears Jill's clothes before going out to the well. This is to make it look as if the two of them have just had a quick session in the barn, thus Frank's men don't expect Harmonica to be armed and ready to fight and so let their guard down. Secondly, a lot of people (including Alex Cox in the DVD commentary) think there is a continuity error when Frank abducts Jill at Sweetwater and is then seen talking to Morton at his hideout in the cliffs. However the scene where Jill and Frank are in bed together is also at the cliffs &#150; the walls are made of stone. The implication here is that Frank took Jill from Sweetwater back to his hideout, even though there is no linking scene to show it happening.So, it can be a little confusing, but I'd rather have taut narrative than lots of unnecessary material bogging the story down. Besides, with a film that is this entertaining and this beautiful, there's no burden whatsoever in having to watch it over and over&#133; ","genre":null},{"date":"19 March 2007","score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" It's funny how so many of the greatest westerns, particularly those by directors who are best known for the westerns, are ones which deal with the death of the old west.

Jill and the railway both represent the death of the west. The coming of the railway of course literally heralded the end of an era, but Leone also had a rather strange theory that this time was also the beginning of a matriarchy in America &#150; so women also represent change. Jill and the railway are often synonymous. Jill arrives on the train. The train is black and so is Jill's dress. In contrast, most of the characters are dressed in browns and yellows, matching the landscape of the open plains. The railway magnate is called Morton &#150; mort as in death. Another very subtle touch is that most of the movement is towards or away from the camera. Jill and the train are the only things regularly seen moving from side to side across the frame, as if they are the only ones really going anywhere.The flipside to this atmosphere of death is that it is tinged with the hope of rebirth and progress. This is represented by the recurrent water motif, as water symbolises life. The train needs water to run, and the Sweetwater ranch will provide a watering stop. Jill likes to bath frequently, and later she brings water to the railway workers. Jill is a survivor, and she and Sweetwater represent hope for the future.While Harmonica, Frank and Jill have been analysed to death elsewhere, the character of Cheyenne I feel is often overlooked. Although he rarely drives the plot along and could have been edited out of the story without changing much, he is really central to the tone of the film. He more than any other single character represents the old west. He is tough and rugged on the exterior, but gradually his façade is stripped away to reveal a tired, middle-aged man who just wants to settle down. He is the most real, the most human character, and the one given the most depth. Jason Robard's performance has also come in for a lot of flak, but I think he's perfect for the role &#150; he does that forlorn look very well.Ennio Morricone's music here continues to evolve alongside Leone's style. The score of Once Upon a Time in the West is not as rousing or listenable as the music from the Dollars Trilogy, but it perfectly mirrors that sad and weary tone. The Leone-Morricone trademark of giving each character their own musical theme is even more firmly stated here. It's particularly clever how the theme for the final confrontation mixes Harmonica's and Frank's themes. Leone and Morricone also worked together to make use of natural sound to create atmosphere, something which up to this point had only really been explored by Alfred Hitchcock (most memorably in The Birds, but I'm also thinking of the use of sound in his 1930's pictures). In the opening scene, the creaking of the windmill, the chattering of the telegraph machine and a number of other noises take the place of a musical backing.If there is anything wrong at all with Once Upon a Time in the West, it's that it takes either repeated viewings are extreme concentration to take in every minor plot point and understand every character motivation. The dialogue is sparse, and often more for effect than to give information. There are many short cuts in the narrative and very little is made obvious, so most of the time you have to join the dots yourself to work out exactly what is going on in each scene. There are two pieces I find people get confused about most often, so I'll give my explanations here. Firstly, why Harmonica tears Jill's clothes before going out to the well. This is to make it look as if the two of them have just had a quick session in the barn, thus Frank's men don't expect Harmonica to be armed and ready to fight and so let their guard down. Secondly, a lot of people (including Alex Cox in the DVD commentary) think there is a continuity error when Frank abducts Jill at Sweetwater and is then seen talking to Morton at his hideout in the cliffs. However the scene where Jill and Frank are in bed together is also at the cliffs &#150; the walls are made of stone. The implication here is that Frank took Jill from Sweetwater back to his hideout, even though there is no linking scene to show it happening.So, it can be a little confusing, but I'd rather have taut narrative than lots of unnecessary material bogging the story down.

There's John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance; Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch; Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven to name but three. However, for me the best of all these is Leone's masterpiece Once Upon a Time in the West. It is also my favourite of all Leone's pictures.Leone had always been a director who packed his films with atmosphere, style and rhythm, but here he organises every single element to create one overwhelming mood.

I'm not sure if that helped it our didn't. Stepfather II follows a man (Terry O'Quinn) who escapes from his mental institution near Seattle, Washington and assumes the identity of a psychiatrist after murdering an entire family years earlier. He finds a nice home in a Southern California suburb where he meets Carol (Meg Foster), a single mother who sells real estate. While assuming the identity of a man named Dr. Gene Clifford, the two begin to form a relationship, until Carol's ex-husband enters the picture, trying to get together with her again. Gene ends up murdering him one night in a violent rage. Matty (Caroline Williams, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2), Carol's friend, suspects that Gene isn't quite normal, but Carol refuses to identify that there is anything wrong with him. Step-parents and blended families are hard enough to work out - but what about when your step parent is a psychotic murderer? I've heard a lot of great things about the original Stepfather movie and it's supposedly a pretty good horror flick. I came across this film one day and couldn't find the original, so I decided to just watch this film, figuring I wouldn't need to see the original to understand the plot - and I didn't. The film made perfect sense without seeing the original. While it had already been done before in the original movie, the premise is actually quite unique and had the potential to be very scary. Having step-parents and blended families is difficult (I know this from personal experiences), and the idea of a step-parent being a murderer is a great basis for a horror story. You may not always know somebody as well as you think, and that is a classic set up that works effectively here. Sadly though, this film fails to be scary - it's more of a thriller I'd say. The storyline is well written and surprisingly doesn't contain any plot holes (or at least that I picked up on). The pacing is a little bit slow in the beginning of the movie, but it starts to build a little and begins to kick in after awhile as we get to know our psychotic villain a little bit more.The acting is pretty good as well, not perfect though. Terry O'Quinn is menacing as the diabolical evil Stepfather and plays his character well. Meg Foster is the nice single mother, and Caroline Williams (the leading lady from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2) is her somewhat nosy but likable best friend. Again, the acting isn't perfect, but it's good enough. The film is directed by Jeff Burr (who a year later directed Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre III) and he is creative with the film. There are some inventive sequences and crafty shots (especially near the end of the film). There isn't too much violence here, a few stabbings and a strangulation - but this is no splatter movie. Another small problem is that the movie ends a little abruptly and I would have liked to see a more dramatic climax, but the ending is passable enough and I must admit that I really like the final shot.Overall, Stepfather II is a decent killer thriller movie. It has a great premise and some sufficient thrills that are worth the time. I haven't seen the original film so I can't compare, but this was an enjoyable late-'80s horror flick that is worth watching if you like this kind of thing.

This is the case with Red Beard, a picture best known for being the last in a long line of collaborations with actor Toshiro Mifune.Kurosawa typically had a kind of mission statement with every film he made. During his 1960's output he appears to have become increasingly stubborn and obsessive in making a film for a reason. In the case of Red Beard, he was appalled at the number of poor quality ultra-violent Samurai flicks being churned out in the wake of his own recent action pictures, Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1963). As a backlash he decided to make a period picture with a peaceful, non-action theme, more of a pure drama. Furthermore, in an abandonment of the cynicism which had marked all his films from The Bad Sleep Well (1960) onwards, he declared that Red Beard was to be a tribute to the goodness in humanity. There is nothing wrong with this is a basis for a film &#150; it's just that Kurosawa tries too hard.Kurosawa was, or at least had been a director who handled emotional moments with skill. Consider for example the terminally ill hero in Ikiru (1952) drunkenly singing in the bar, or Kikuchiyo rescuing the baby in Seven Samurai (1954). Bearing these past triumphs in mind it's almost painful to see how he fails completely to achieve the same effect in Red Beard. Here the audience is practically bombarded with moments of strained poignancy. There is absolutely no subtlety, as one heavy-handed sob story after another is cranked out.The problem is further compounded by the fact that Red Beard is structured as a series of short stories with the same setting, as patients come and go at the hospital. It's really very difficult to share any feeling with the characters because we never really get to know them &#150; we just hear about their past misery. Whenever characters cry (which happens all the time), it's difficult for the audience to connect to them. Eventually all the stories of grief and woe just start to sound ridiculous.Of course, there is one overarching storyline, that of the young doctor Yasumoto's transformation from being a selfish snob who resents having to treat poor people, to a dedicated professional who takes satisfaction in his work. This is for me the most satisfying and engaging part of the plot. The most uplifting moment in the film is when Yasumoto wears his uniform for the first time, and is immediately greeted with greater respect from both colleagues and patients.And, in spite of his poor judgement with the plot, Kurosawa's direction is still of good standard and there are plenty of marks of quality. He matches the warm, sensitive tone of the film with a delicate approach to his shot composition, and a slow and measured pace to each scene. In the first half of the film, he shows Yasumoto's feelings about having to work at the clinic by shooting the interiors in such a way that they appear cramped and confining. When Yasumoto dons his uniform the spaces begin to open out and a little more light is let in. There's also a sly nod towards Kurosawa and Mifune's earlier pictures in the film's only real action sequence. It's choreographed just like the frantic arm-chopping scene from Yojimbo, but rather than drawing a sword Mifune is instead twisting limbs and cracking bones in a completely bloodless fight.It's a pity that this was Mifune's swansong with Kurosawa, not just because it's a poorer film, but also because Mifune is somewhat sidelined to a secondary role (in spite of being the titular character), and it's not a performance where he really gets to flourish.

It's full of great sight gags, more daring versions of run-of-the-mill army jokes, satirically realized characters that are written to take devastating aim realistic versions, et cetera. Aside from all of that, the reason that it is all so funny is because of the surrounding point of it all Alan Arkin's character simply cannot escape the binds of the military regulations and rules, which come in the form of an endless stream of subtle catch-22s. The premise of course is founded upon the catch-22 that Arkin faces when trying to be declared insane so he doesn't have to fly anymore missions, a hilarious boundary of opposing yet still compatible reasons, but throughout the film, a flow of smaller catch-22s decorates the plot.

An early example of this is Secret Agent.During World War I, a British soldier named Brodie (John Gielgud) famous for his novels finds himself suddenly declared dead by a mysterious figure named R. R wants Brodie to travel to Switzerland under the name Ashenden and help eliminate a German, identity to be determined, who is paying Arabs to cause trouble around British-controlled Palestine. Helping Brodie will be another mysterious figure, the hairless Mexican, played by Peter Lorre at a high histrionic pitch, as well as Elsa (Madeleine Carroll), a naive young spy who pretends to be Mrs. Ashenden.Right from the beginning, when we watch a one-armed man messily upend a coffin for no apparent reason except to reveal it is empty, Secret Agent is aimed more for effect than making sense. The effects are often good, too. An innocent-looking old man buys a bar of chocolate, then opens it outside to toss the chocolate and read a secret message in the wrapping. Gielgud and Lorre are to meet a fellow at a church, and as they go deeper inside, the lone, sustained note of a pipe organ grows louder and more ominous.The strongest set piece involves the fellow Gielgud and Lorre's characters figure to be the German agent, how they set to neutralize him, and the shocking end note Hitchcock lays on you after it is done. As another user review here, by Zetes, notes quite well, this is one of two Hitchcock films from 1936 that really pushes the viewer's face into an unhappy sudden death. The difference, and the reason the other film, Sabotage, successfully carries it off and this doesn't, is because Sabotage is a heavy-toned film throughout. Secret Agent, on the other hand, is played for a lark, and so when Hitchcock deals his trump, it's a mean trick the film never recovers from.At least the scene makes an impact on screen, more than you can say for John Gielgud, who wears the same air of aristocratic diffidence he did when Dudley Moore told him he wanted a bath some 45 years later. Both director and star blamed one another for the poor way Brodie\/Ashenden comes off, and both probably had a point. Gielgud never did anything for me in lead roles, anyway.Lorre grabs you by the throat and never lets go, even when it would be better he did. Taking out his frustrations on a roll of toilet paper when he discovers Elsa was requisitioned to Brodie, he screeches entertainingly for about half a minute but then like the Energizer Bunny keeps going and going. Carroll, so good in The 39 Steps, an obvious model for Secret Agent, is too silly to be believable here, spending most of her time being chased by Robert Young. Young utters some inane dialogue in wooing the woman he believes married, but he also gives the best performance, something you notice especially on a second viewing. It was Hitchcock's first time working with a name American actor, and strange they never paired up again.While the story is a letdown, what's good about Secret Agent is the energy with which it moves. Not that it isn't dull for long intervals, but it does develop a pace and energy that almost compensate for the lack of sense on screen. The comic undertones throughout help move things along, as well as point in the direction of North By Northwest and other Class-A Hitchcock suspense films to come. If not his best film, you can see in Secret Agent Hitchcock learning as he goes.

And *yet* there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie, a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna, and on the way there start to talking about things, at first arbitrary, then personal (Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather). Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town', in Vienna, until his plane the next morning.Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine, in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance, and in a sense is about the act of having conversations, of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another. Here it's often about relationships and commitments, as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential, or seemingly so, and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. We hear confessions of desires for other loves, or what weren't really loves, of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life, of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form, or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul (I loved the bit about the quakers in the church), and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism. Jessie may be more responsible for that last part, but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself, just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives.Meanwhile, it's always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles, where they're not incessantly annoying in that 90s Generation-X mode, but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film, which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one, one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere. The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other, where sweet asides are actually acceptable (I have to tell you a secret, Jessie says, and then leans in for a kiss, ho-ho), or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way. I loved the scene with the poet, where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal, or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share, but really are seeing them do it first-hand. All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly- we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future...Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness, however self-contained, as it may lead into something more. Who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and be that much more attached than a married couple? This is perhaps Linklater's thesis, but there's more to it than just that. It's a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly.

I grew up watching Henry Winkler as the Fonz and he's had success as a serious actor and as a producer. Ron Howard went on from this very early film to grow as a director into one of the finest in his craft. Keaton has rarely made a bad film and is consistently good to watch in both dramatic and comedic moments.Having said all this, I have to forgive them all for having made this film. In the day it was made I suppose this type of humor was acceptable and tickled not a few funny bones. Frankly, it has not aged well and having now watched it for the first time in 2007 it made me roll my eyes in disbelief. The script is silly beyond reckoning and totally not believable. I mean, when we watch Ghostbusters for example, we know that the script is a cartoon and no one stops to consider if it could have happened. When we watch Blues Brothers or Animal House we know that although very exaggerated, they are believable in their own crazy ways. When we watch Night Shift then no, it is not believable for these types of lunacies to carry on in the night shift of a city morgue. I know it's a farce but the humor was lost on me. Winkler's character was the most limp-wrist pansy I've seen in years. One get's the impression that a strong gust of wind would blow him over. Keaton, in his debut steals all his scenes and is funny to watch, given the script. There were all kinds of films from that era (I just watched Nine to Five) that at the time we thought quite funny. Now they just make me squirm or wonder why they were made? Great humor is universal and passes it's message on from generation to generation. Think of Chaplin and Keaton and you'll see my point. This film, while early in their careers is just too weak, silly and in our internet-violent world just ridiculous.

He impulsively takes over Hope Memoral Hospital in Chicago, calling himself John Q. (as in John Q. Public), holds the minimal weekend staff hostage and demands that his son be put on the list of recipients for a donated heart by a doctor (Anne Heche). Outside, the police (Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta) surround the place, a thousand guns aimed at the hospital, and try variously to negotiate with him or to snipe him. No donor being available, Washington decides that since he and his son have been tissue-typed and match, Washington will blow his own brains out to provide the necessary heart. Lots of arguments follow, involving chiefly one of the hostages who happens to be a cardiac surgeon (James Woods). As in a miracle, a young woman with a matching heart dies and the donation comes through just as Washington is wrestling with the damned safety on the automatic he's holding to his head. Whew! A close call, I'd say.Well, it has a truly competent professional cast, no doubt about it, and they play it at par. Also quite good in a small role is Paul Johansson. Nick Cassavetes' direction is functional but no more than that.The movie's up against the wall though. Inevitably we're dealing with de Maupassant's Boule de Souif, in which a small group of people of varying tastes and backgrounds are squeezed together under pressure and little dramas play out between them. In a case like this the success depends as much on the script as on anything else. Given that it's going to look a little mechanical, and given that none if any of the characters can be given full development, whether the film satisfies or not hangs on what the characters say.Stagecoach did a fine job, and so did Twelve Angry Men and Dog Day Afternoon, so it's not an impossible task. The characters here are mostly predictably stereotyped. Among the police, we have the negotiator in conflict with the exterminator. We have conflict within the hospital between the pragmatist doctor and the humanist doctor. Among the waiting-room patients we have the noble black couple about to have their first child and the cowardly slapaho sniveling braggart of a white guy. The police sniper is fat, sweaty, sneering, and ugly.And they pretty much stay the way they are. There is a good deal of preaching that goes on. HMOs come in for a good deal of abuse. We know immediately that the chief of police, Liotta, is a simple-minded goon because he shows up at the hostage situation in full uniform, dripping with decorations, shaking hands with the press, telling everyone what to do because he knows best -- How do you think I got THESE?, he shouts at Duvall's negotiator, pointing to the four stars on his shoulder. Oh -- the press. I forgot about the press. I leave it up to you to guess whether the model presented to us is the same as that in the Die Hard films (get the scoop at all costs, and make sure my hair looks good) or the idealistic responsible model the fifth estate would like us to swear to. The film overall takes a worthwhile story about a social issue and turns it into and almost unbroken string of sentimental clichés. There are some good things going for the film, despite the weaknesses of the script. A few exchanges stand out. As in Dog Day Afternoon, when the crowd cheers Al Pacino, there is a crowd here that goes wild with applause when Denzel Washington appears at the hospital door. But Duvall puts it in perspective. You're just the cause for today. Tomorrow you'll be forgotten. Anne Heche, the hard-boiled doctor, is given a good line too. If we give in to Washington's demands today, tomorrow the hospitals will be filled with gun-toting loonies. Why is it a good line, when nothing more is made of it? Because although it sounds like common sense there is not the slightest evidence that it's true. Our values are filled with such axioms. We never negotiate with terrorists. We only negotiate from a position of strength. Give 'em an inch and they'll take a mile. Skinnerian reenforcement works well with puppies and rats under controlled conditions. But does it work outside the lab? Probably, in a general way, but what's really at stake when we refuse negotiation -- reenforcement or our own pride? Should life and death depend on a notion so simple that it can be put on a bumper sticker? The film isn't entirely original or gripping, despite the tension inherent in the situation, but I'd be willing to rate it above average if it just makes us think a little more about that primitive belief.It's necessary to add that this is not a partisan liberal tract. The economics of HMOs is briefly and cogently explained and they come out looking bad. Not because they're evil but because that's the way health plans were structured. They were a social problem years before they became a political issue.

He impulsively takes over Hope Memoral Hospital in Chicago, calling himself John Q. (as in John Q. Public), holds the minimal weekend staff hostage and demands that his son be put on the list of recipients for a donated heart by a doctor (Anne Heche). Outside, the police (Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta) surround the place, a thousand guns aimed at the hospital, and try variously to negotiate with him or to snipe him. No donor being available, Washington decides that since he and his son have been tissue-typed and match, Washington will blow his own brains out to provide the necessary heart. Lots of arguments follow, involving chiefly one of the hostages who happens to be a cardiac surgeon (James Woods). As in a miracle, a young woman with a matching heart dies and the donation comes through just as Washington is wrestling with the damned safety on the automatic he's holding to his head. Whew! A close call, I'd say.Well, it has a truly competent professional cast, no doubt about it, and they play it at par. Also quite good in a small role is Paul Johansson. Nick Cassavetes' direction is functional but no more than that.The movie's up against the wall though. Inevitably we're dealing with de Maupassant's Boule de Souif, in which a small group of people of varying tastes and backgrounds are squeezed together under pressure and little dramas play out between them. In a case like this the success depends as much on the script as on anything else. Given that it's going to look a little mechanical, and given that none if any of the characters can be given full development, whether the film satisfies or not hangs on what the characters say.Stagecoach did a fine job, and so did Twelve Angry Men and Dog Day Afternoon, so it's not an impossible task. The characters here are mostly predictably stereotyped. Among the police, we have the negotiator in conflict with the exterminator. We have conflict within the hospital between the pragmatist doctor and the humanist doctor. Among the waiting-room patients we have the noble black couple about to have their first child and the cowardly slapaho sniveling braggart of a white guy. The police sniper is fat, sweaty, sneering, and ugly.And they pretty much stay the way they are. There is a good deal of preaching that goes on. HMOs come in for a good deal of abuse. We know immediately that the chief of police, Liotta, is a simple-minded goon because he shows up at the hostage situation in full uniform, dripping with decorations, shaking hands with the press, telling everyone what to do because he knows best -- How do you think I got THESE?, he shouts at Duvall's negotiator, pointing to the four stars on his shoulder. Oh -- the press. I forgot about the press. I leave it up to you to guess whether the model presented to us is the same as that in the Die Hard films (get the scoop at all costs, and make sure my hair looks good) or the idealistic responsible model the fifth estate would like us to swear to. The film overall takes a worthwhile story about a social issue and turns it into and almost unbroken string of sentimental clichés. There are some good things going for the film, despite the weaknesses of the script. A few exchanges stand out. As in Dog Day Afternoon, when the crowd cheers Al Pacino, there is a crowd here that goes wild with applause when Denzel Washington appears at the hospital door. But Duvall puts it in perspective. You're just the cause for today. Tomorrow you'll be forgotten. Anne Heche, the hard-boiled doctor, is given a good line too. If we give in to Washington's demands today, tomorrow the hospitals will be filled with gun-toting loonies. Why is it a good line, when nothing more is made of it? Because although it sounds like common sense there is not the slightest evidence that it's true. Our values are filled with such axioms. We never negotiate with terrorists. We only negotiate from a position of strength. Give 'em an inch and they'll take a mile. Skinnerian reenforcement works well with puppies and rats under controlled conditions. But does it work outside the lab? Probably, in a general way, but what's really at stake when we refuse negotiation -- reenforcement or our own pride? Should life and death depend on a notion so simple that it can be put on a bumper sticker? The film isn't entirely original or gripping, despite the tension inherent in the situation, but I'd be willing to rate it above average if it just makes us think a little more about that primitive belief.It's necessary to add that this is not a partisan liberal tract. The economics of HMOs is briefly and cogently explained and they come out looking bad. Not because they're evil but because that's the way health plans were structured. They were a social problem years before they became a political issue.

However, once you peel away the excellent direction and well-coiffed hairdos, you are left with a very silly film indeed.As an ex-therapist and psychology teacher, SOME psychological aspects of the film were very, very interesting while other parts were so flawed and silly I found myself laughing during the second half of the film. Marnie has an Antisocial Personality Disorder. She hates men and takes great pleasure in stealing--and has no pangs of conscience whatsoever. In addition, she has a classic case of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder because throughout the film she had flashbacks from an early childhood trauma. Lots of little things, such as thunder and the color red trigger these memories.Now so far, none of the qualities I listed above would make it seem like she's a good candidate for marriage--especially since the touch of a man fills her with disgust. So naturally, when Sean Connery discovers that she is a career criminal, he falls for her and marries her!!! Can anyone really be that stupid? Perhaps,...but it gets worse. He discovers on their honeymoon (after he blackmailed her into marrying him) that she is 100% frigid--and boy, do I mean FRIGID!!! She even tries to kill herself after he forces himself on her (or tries to force himself--the film is unclear here). Now what would any sane man do now--she's a crook, she's cold and indifferent towards him and is nauseated by sex--yep, he'll stay married to her and try to work it all out without outside professional help!! After all, his college training as a botanist certainly would qualify Connery to treat her!! At this point in the film, I felt really irritated. Most of it was because it was such a silly premise. But, when together they face up to her childhood trauma it all comes flooding back and she's magically cured, it was just too much! Maybe Connery missed his calling--after all, no therapist is THAT good and he could have made far more money doing that instead of acting!!! All in all, some very interesting and brave topics but handled in a ham-fisted and silly manner--as if Hitchcock and the writers read an intro psychology text and then decided to make a film!!! Pure hooey despite some interesting performances.
