It's great and doesn't give the illusion of perfection, but there are problems. However, if you want to get a career in production, especially as a screenwriter, director, or DP, you should watch it if only for instructional purposes. As a whole, it's memorable and therefore it isn't surprising that it's regarded as a classic film.The story follows two outlaws who start off robbing trains with their cronies, but later have to go on the run after their band is killed by law enforcement. We see nothing of our antagonists, who are loosely named but never have any development. We are meant to like Butch Cassidy because of his light-hearted optimism more than the sullen and irritable Sundance. Butch also seems to have more self-confidence and is okay with what he does, whereas Sundance tries to hide behind facades of toughness that betray his fears, making him seem almost cowardly instead of rationally afraid. What is interesting about their friendship is that they seem to know very little about one another and yet have complete faith in each other. It makes you wonder what it was like when they first met. They seem to have been friends for a decent amount of time and are familiar with the other's tendencies and personality. With the pair throughout some of their escapades is their shared lover Etta Place. She is pretty well written for her type of character, clearly transcending the social norms of women in her setting and perhaps even those of the 1960's. She is not objectified or portrayed as weak, but neither is she a man-eater that can combat law enforcement single-handedly like a female superhero. Basically, we can see that she is a strong woman without ever actually being shown it.The plot can cater to fans of pretty much any genre because it contains elements of several genres, but none is overly prominent. There is excitement and the illusion of action throughout, but the only true action set piece comes at the climax. There is a romantic plot with Butch and Sundance trading Etta, but it's not overly prominent. There is a bit of mystery in who is chasing the two\/three outlaws. The western setting and bank robbing scenes also cater to fans of westerns and crime movies. And, as with any work of cinema, there is a feeling of dramatic conflict throughout. However, none of these plot lines are ever fully resolved, which might be disappointing. The ending, while picturesque, doesn't bring a satisfyingly final conclusion to any of the story's conflicts.In a production sense, the film is a masterpiece. The directing and camera-work is very artsy and distinct, particularly at the beginning. If the entire movie had been shot as well as the first thirty minutes was, I would have loved it, but instead I just liked it. The only place where the stylized photography didn't work for me was the four minute montage of black and white pictures that showed the three characters traversing the east coast. The script is very well done in a dialogue sense, though pacing is an issue at several points. Newman, Redford, and Ross give us three great performances as well and bring the characters to life before us.I would recommend this to most viewers, but do strongly advise that you have an open mind while watching it and try to appreciate it. I know that this isn't always possible, but it's still worth trying here. If you aren't enjoying it by the time the characters depart for Bolivia, it's probably in your best interests to stop. For those who see it through, you might think it's overrated, perhaps rightly, but it stands the test of time better than most films. Overall Rating 8\/10.

Naturally, it is the sequel to the most popular film of nineteen eighty-five, and one of my favorite films of all time, Back to the Future. They did not expect the film to become a hit, but when it did, the studio took no time telling them to make a sequel. And so we got this film. The creators have gone on record stating that the 'To Be Continued' at the end of movie one was not supposed to relate to anything, and that if they knew that they were going to be making a sequel, they would have ended it differently.The lack of desire to make this movie in particular shows. A lot. It is disjointed, filled with plot holes, pandering, and altogether does not work as a film that can be enjoyed completely seriously. I do like this film, but I like it in the same way that I like another ridiculous sequel to one of my favorite films of all time Rocky IV. Both films are memorable and ingrained in the public consciousness, but decidedly not what a film critic would consider good.But why? What goes wrong here. Let's take a look at the plot. Marty McFly, the seventeen year-old icon of the 80s himself, goes with his girlfriend Jennifer (played by a different actress and sorely underused in this film) and crazy but awesome (seriously, the man made a time machine) scientist, Doc Brown to the future. What's the year, you may ask if you were living under a rock about a month and a half ago. 2015.I could go into how this movie's description of 2015 compares with the real 2015, but I went into that specifically on a post on my website that I wrote on BTTF Day. Suffice it to say that it is pretty cool in the retro future kind of way, the same way that steampunk and cyberpunk is cool. This is, strangely enough, the weakest section of the movie by far. There are some funny gags, but everything else falls flat.The second third takes us to an alternate 1985. I won't spoil anything (though if you haven't seen this film... shame on you), but suffice it to say that things are not pretty. It lacks the grand dystopian vision of something like Blade Runner, but there is a texture to the atmosphere that I really appreciate. And... I prefer to not get too political, but can we all just agree that the terrifying Alt1985 Biff is Donald Trump.The last third takes us back to 1955. This is both the worse and the best part of the movie. There are a lot of rehash gags here, and it comes dangerously close to completely retreading the plot of movie 1, and it drags on way too long, but the tension is thicker than in any other part, and the last fifteen minutes of the film is one of, if not the best sections of any of these films.There are a lot of parts that are just lame, plain and simple. But I don't feel embarrassment but disappointment. Of all the movies, this one covers the most ground, has the most ambition and imagination, and overall material to make a great film. But whereas the first one did everything right, this film squanders a lot of opportunities. The magic is gone. I wish I could say that it's a great film, but it's just an average one, and my least favorite of the BTTF trilogy.(Still, it is pretty cool how they were able to throw in a couple references to BTTF 3 due to shooting both sequels at the same time.)

This wonderfully created suspense drama is about a jury of 12 men that must come to a unanimous decision to either send an 18 year old boy to the electric chair or to let him free. The young man was placed on trial after supposed evidence was found and eye witnesses saw him murder his father with a knife. At the beginning of the jury meeting, 11 jurors immediately vote to send the boy to the electric chair, while the twelfth is simply hesitant to send the boy to his death without talking about it. Angrily and almost against their will, they discuss the murder case and all the events that take place, and slowly but surely find reasonable doubt in all aspects of the Evidence. For example, 2 witnesses were brought to the court to testify against the boy. One witness saw the murder from across the street as a train was passing by, and the other was in a room below and heard the scream as someone yelled I'm going to kill you! As the Jury discussed both aspects of the witnesses, they decided that it was impossible for the witness below to hear the murder taking place as a train was going by right outside the window. As more and more doubts filled the room, one by one, the jury members started changing their votes to not guilty. Each member of the jury has a different back ground and each seem to find a personal connection to a different member within the trial. One Juror has glasses and identifies with the eye witness who also wears glasses but realizes that when she saw the murder from her bed while looking out the window, she probably wouldn't have been wearing her glasses which would have made it very difficult to see. Another Juror is a father with a bad relationship with his son. He identifies the most with the murder victim who was stabbed supposedly by his own son. He tends to be more ruthless with the young man on trial and is the very last Juror to change his vote to not guilty. I think that this strategy naturally makes the audience try to identify with one of the characters. We tend to ask ourselves, if I were in this situation, who would I be? Would I vote guilty or not guilty? We all like to think that we would be the first one to vote not guilty. Compassion wins the star role in this film. There may be many different kinds of moral statutes that the film makers lead the audience to believe, but they all tie back into this one simple concept. One of our greatest and most noble examples of compassion is the biblical reference to Jesus Christ. In some ways, this movie can be related to that seeing as the main character can be seen as a savior for the young man on trial, but because of the very real human element in the film, this is clearly the exact opposite. The first juror may have all the compassion in the world but that just simply doesn't do it justice. He must also convince his fellow 11 apostles to have this same kind of compassion which eventually saves this young boys life. Compassion is what makes the audience identify with the main character, not justice. If all 12 jurors had walked into the room, quickly voted that the evidence was good and that this boy was without a doubt the killer then it wouldn't have been in justice or ruthless in the least. After all in the minds of 12 imperfect people, this was a case where the killer was proved guilty. Granted the movie would have no plot and it wouldn't have been nominated for 3 academy awards, but it would have been just in the eyes of the legal system. So why does the audience vote for this random act of compassion? Is it just? This film has been numbered among the great drama classics in history. Not because of its amazing CGI ability to make super robots fight aliens, nor its Megan Fox type lead female role, but because of the film makers ability to creatively persuade its audience to be morally upright. We as Americans are always trying to better ourselves. It's in our blood. However, sometimes we try to focus more on the qualities that will benefit ourselves, instead of helping other people. We try to lose weight, we try to be funnier, be interesting. All of these things are great to a certain extent, but what these brilliant film writers are doing is trying to help us realize is that being American is not about us. It's about helping us to become our best selves in order to help other people. Sure, being determined, skilled compassionate, etc. can help us personally, but how can we take these personal strengths and apply them to be the best Americans we can be? The main character said it best when he announced, wouldn't you want someone to do the same for you if you were in his position? The room may have been silent, but the audience already knows the answer to that question. The anger portion of this movie is not so much anger as it is a character development struggle to become a better more compassionate individual. The argument in this film is one that we lack in today's modern cinema. If the new and upcoming film makers want to learn from history, then they need to take a blast to the past because films like these teach us to be American, be just, but more importantly, to be compassionate.

Granted the movie would have no plot and it wouldn't have been nominated for 3 academy awards, but it would have been just in the eyes of the legal system. So why does the audience vote for this random act of compassion? Is it just? This film has been numbered among the great drama classics in history. Not because of its amazing CGI ability to make super robots fight aliens, nor its Megan Fox type lead female role, but because of the film makers ability to creatively persuade its audience to be morally upright. We as Americans are always trying to better ourselves. It's in our blood. However, sometimes we try to focus more on the qualities that will benefit ourselves, instead of helping other people. We try to lose weight, we try to be funnier, be interesting. All of these things are great to a certain extent, but what these brilliant film writers are doing is trying to help us realize is that being American is not about us. It's about helping us to become our best selves in order to help other people. Sure, being determined, skilled compassionate, etc. can help us personally, but how can we take these personal strengths and apply them to be the best Americans we can be? The main character said it best when he announced, wouldn't you want someone to do the same for you if you were in his position? The room may have been silent, but the audience already knows the answer to that question. The anger portion of this movie is not so much anger as it is a character development struggle to become a better more compassionate individual. The argument in this film is one that we lack in today's modern cinema. If the new and upcoming film makers want to learn from history, then they need to take a blast to the past because films like these teach us to be American, be just, but more importantly, to be compassionate. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"6 December 2015","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The Film 12 Angry Men is an amazingly written classic film from the year 1957. This wonderfully created suspense drama is about a jury of 12 men that must come to a unanimous decision to either send an 18 year old boy to the electric chair or to let him free. The young man was placed on trial after supposed evidence was found and eye witnesses saw him murder his father with a knife. At the beginning of the jury meeting, 11 jurors immediately vote to send the boy to the electric chair, while the twelfth is simply hesitant to send the boy to his death without talking about it. Angrily and almost against their will, they discuss the murder case and all the events that take place, and slowly but surely find reasonable doubt in all aspects of the Evidence. For example, 2 witnesses were brought to the court to testify against the boy. One witness saw the murder from across the street as a train was passing by, and the other was in a room below and heard the scream as someone yelled I'm going to kill you! As the Jury discussed both aspects of the witnesses, they decided that it was impossible for the witness below to hear the murder taking place as a train was going by right outside the window. As more and more doubts filled the room, one by one, the jury members started changing their votes to not guilty. Each member of the jury has a different back ground and each seem to find a personal connection to a different member within the trial. One Juror has glasses and identifies with the eye witness who also wears glasses but realizes that when she saw the murder from her bed while looking out the window, she probably wouldn't have been wearing her glasses which would have made it very difficult to see. Another Juror is a father with a bad relationship with his son. He identifies the most with the murder victim who was stabbed supposedly by his own son. He tends to be more ruthless with the young man on trial and is the very last Juror to change his vote to not guilty. I think that this strategy naturally makes the audience try to identify with one of the characters. We tend to ask ourselves, if I were in this situation, who would I be? Would I vote guilty or not guilty? We all like to think that we would be the first one to vote not guilty. Compassion wins the star role in this film. There may be many different kinds of moral statutes that the film makers lead the audience to believe, but they all tie back into this one simple concept. One of our greatest and most noble examples of compassion is the biblical reference to Jesus Christ. In some ways, this movie can be related to that seeing as the main character can be seen as a savior for the young man on trial, but because of the very real human element in the film, this is clearly the exact opposite. The first juror may have all the compassion in the world but that just simply doesn't do it justice. He must also convince his fellow 11 apostles to have this same kind of compassion which eventually saves this young boys life. Compassion is what makes the audience identify with the main character, not justice. If all 12 jurors had walked into the room, quickly voted that the evidence was good and that this boy was without a doubt the killer then it wouldn't have been in justice or ruthless in the least. After all in the minds of 12 imperfect people, this was a case where the killer was proved guilty.

Pierce Brosnan plays Bond this time and he's amazing in the role definitely one of my Top 3 Bonds. Martin Campbell directs this movie and it's one of the most well directed action movies ever made. This is a Bond film that is very difficult to top. This is not the traditional Bond we know and love, but somehow it manages to be just as good.This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I'll explain why This is the first Bond movie with a fully original story after The Spy Who Loved Me (which only had the title of the novel). The pacing is really good, it's fast and only stops when it's really needed.The characters are all great. Sean Bean is fantastic as Alec Trevelyan. He's an insane mastermind who is definitely one of the best Bond villains of all time. Izabella Scorupco as Natalya Simonova is the third best Bond girl in my opinion after Diana Rigg's Tracy and Barbara Bach's Anya Amasova. Famke Janseen as Xenia Onatopp is one of the best henchmen and how she kills people is genius. Another memorable henchman is Alan Cumming as Boris Grishenko, a nerdy guy who thinks he's invincible. Gottfried John plays yet another villainous general - Ourumov in James Bond franchise and he's absolutely great. Joe Don Baker works much better as Jack Wade than as Brad Whitaker in The Living Daylights. He is one of the best Bond allies and so is Robbie Coltrane as Valentin Zukovsky. Samantha Bond replaces the awful Caroline Bliss as Moneypenny and she's the second best Moneypenny, with only Lois Maxwell in front. But most importantly we get Judi Dench as M, she is the best M we've ever seen, she's complex and it really feels like she's Bond's boss. Desmond Llewelyn returns as Q and we have one of the best Q branch scenes.Action is very well done especially the tank chase. Bond never takes advantage of the new BMW car but it's redeemed by awesome gadgets such as exploding pen.The main song by Tina Turner is great. But Eric Serra's score for the movie is overall pretty weak.Now this movie might not please the fans of classic Bond that much, but any action movie fan will enjoy this one. This movie was definitely worth 6 years and it's a very impressive movie that won't leave your mind soon. I can't praise this film enough. I've got 10\/10 for you tonight.

The film takes place in the big city where the movie industry is booming and cartoons are living members of society, so you have brightly colored cartoons walking around the not so bright real world. The problem I have with this is that the cartoons are where they put all the adult content. The cartoons doing things that are sexual or swearing like a sailor and other adult actions. I find that this was a very common thing during the mid to late 1900s to have cartoon characters doing this sort of thing but not to the extreme that this movie takes it to, i believe more adults watched cartoons during this time so they were catering to them in part.The problem with having adult content mixed with the good humor is the fact that a larger number of children are still watching these cartoons, children idolize cartoon characters and when they do inappropriate things kids may find it OK. At one point in the movie a well endowed female toon is being searched for something and another toon sticks his hand down her shirt between the breasts, This is a PG film with many well-known cartoon characters in it kids are going to see that and may think that's all right, when if any adult did that he could go to jail on sexual harassment charges.Speaking of there over use of sexuality, the female I spoke of earlier is brought to the stage at the start of the film as the main entertainment in a bar. She is a singer and a very seductive presence that the all man club just loves. She is over sexualized for the entire length of the movie from seducing men to get her way to having someone stand up off the ground and run into her far too large breasts.Sexual behavior is not the only adult things the toons are doing. People seem to think that if it's a bright colored moving drawing that they can do whatever and it's not a problem because it's not a real person. The toons do most of the swearing and smoking and are rude and violent quite often, well the human characters do not, except for a select few times. For children that connect with the toons better than the adult characters it could be confusing. Not to mention it is not what anyone is expecting from them making for an uncomfortable environment for many adults.As far as the human characters they don't have much to them they just don't do much except the two main human characters. The side cast of living people just draw attention to the things I talked about earlier by commenting on the nature or appearance of toons objectifying them every chance they get. It reminded me a great deal of racial prejudice, toons are treated like property and loaned between the different studios.

After all they still convey awesome chemistry together the action and stunts are just as if even more fun to watch it'll make your heads feel dizzy. But like in the first Rush Hour movie, the action and the stunts usurp the storyline once again. The plot once again lack in anything original, however this time around, the villains and the supporting performers are lowered to more questionable purposes. In the sequel we find Detective James Carter (Tucker) and Chief Inspector Lee (Chan) are on sabbatical in China but are actually on a police investigation which are vital clues to Lee's father's mysterious death many years ago. In a vicarious situation, Lee and Carter have become involved in an American Embassy bombing conspiracy and have become focal targets to a diabolical faction called The Triad led by crime lord Ricky Tan (John Lone). This mystery leads our heroes from China, back to Los Angeles and then to Nevada to unravel the mystery behind this conspiracy. While Tucker and Chan are still equally dynamic as they were before, with Chan's high-flying and laid-back character that's contrary to Tucker's non-stop blabbering, the comedy and the action are are both handed out in equal proportions. One of the big differences is that in Rush Hour 2 Carter is the foreigner here. One of the newer refreshing elements to this sequel is that Carter has now taken an interest for The Beach Boys and Lee has found a greater appreciation for hip-hop music. The same schtick involving racial barriers is continued here, more than before mind you, and Tucker's quick-witted one-liners will likely make you laugh till you wet your pants. Some of the more funnier scenes take place in a karaoke bar, at a massage parlour and some seductive interactions with Secret Agent Isabella Molina (Rosalyn Sanchez). While the jokes are pretty much still the same as before, it's still all in good fun, even if there's not enough material to spawn a sequel, let alone a trilogy like in 2007. While Don Cheadle and Jeremy Piven are amazing in their cameo roles, I found the primary weakness comes from the less than stellar supporting cast and villains. Sanchez comes across as playing an important role here as Secret Agent Isabella, but the subplots involving this sultry spy feels awkward and not very well received. Sure a strong female supporting protagonist would be a great addition to our heroes, however Isabella's role falls stale and lacks the integrity this role greatly needs. Zhang Ziyi as one of the Triad's villainous' Hu Li may provide some seductive evilness to the plot, sadly her scenes were few and far between and seems to lack in character development. Meanwhile John Lone as the leading bad guy here is just like the first villain in the series, very formulaic and clichéd and lacks the charisma to really hold one's interest. Even the fight scenes and the climax feels just like seeing the first installment without really offering anything new to the series. Even the bad guy's demises in the end repeats itself. Rush Hour 2 is an exciting, light on the brains action- comedy that will surely entertain you for the next 90 minutes. The main flaw is a lot of things stay the same and very little changes. Still anyone who enjoyed the first film will surely enjoy this sequel but there is no need to watch the first one before watching the second film. Once the credit roll, don't leave your seats. The bloopers will surely make you laugh your heads off. It's like the dessert after finishing the main course.

","genre":null},{"date":"6 December 2015","score":"","review":" Even though the setting and the plot of Rush Hour 2 makes no difference in the fun and excitement from the original 1998 Rush Hour, starring the dynamic duo of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. After all they still convey awesome chemistry together the action and stunts are just as if even more fun to watch it'll make your heads feel dizzy. But like in the first Rush Hour movie, the action and the stunts usurp the storyline once again. The plot once again lack in anything original, however this time around, the villains and the supporting performers are lowered to more questionable purposes. In the sequel we find Detective James Carter (Tucker) and Chief Inspector Lee (Chan) are on sabbatical in China but are actually on a police investigation which are vital clues to Lee's father's mysterious death many years ago. In a vicarious situation, Lee and Carter have become involved in an American Embassy bombing conspiracy and have become focal targets to a diabolical faction called The Triad led by crime lord Ricky Tan (John Lone). This mystery leads our heroes from China, back to Los Angeles and then to Nevada to unravel the mystery behind this conspiracy. While Tucker and Chan are still equally dynamic as they were before, with Chan's high-flying and laid-back character that's contrary to Tucker's non-stop blabbering, the comedy and the action are are both handed out in equal proportions. One of the big differences is that in Rush Hour 2 Carter is the foreigner here. One of the newer refreshing elements to this sequel is that Carter has now taken an interest for The Beach Boys and Lee has found a greater appreciation for hip-hop music. The same schtick involving racial barriers is continued here, more than before mind you, and Tucker's quick-witted one-liners will likely make you laugh till you wet your pants. Some of the more funnier scenes take place in a karaoke bar, at a massage parlour and some seductive interactions with Secret Agent Isabella Molina (Rosalyn Sanchez). While the jokes are pretty much still the same as before, it's still all in good fun, even if there's not enough material to spawn a sequel, let alone a trilogy like in 2007. While Don Cheadle and Jeremy Piven are amazing in their cameo roles, I found the primary weakness comes from the less than stellar supporting cast and villains. Sanchez comes across as playing an important role here as Secret Agent Isabella, but the subplots involving this sultry spy feels awkward and not very well received. Sure a strong female supporting protagonist would be a great addition to our heroes, however Isabella's role falls stale and lacks the integrity this role greatly needs. Zhang Ziyi as one of the Triad's villainous' Hu Li may provide some seductive evilness to the plot, sadly her scenes were few and far between and seems to lack in character development. Meanwhile John Lone as the leading bad guy here is just like the first villain in the series, very formulaic and clichéd and lacks the charisma to really hold one's interest. Even the fight scenes and the climax feels just like seeing the first installment without really offering anything new to the series. Even the bad guy's demises in the end repeats itself. Rush Hour 2 is an exciting, light on the brains action- comedy that will surely entertain you for the next 90 minutes. The main flaw is a lot of things stay the same and very little changes.

Well, that would describe Danny Zuko (The great John Travolta) right on the mark. Danny is a teenager who is driven by his reputation of being the coolest kid in the school. This film provides an excellent view on the issue of reputation. It argues that having a reputation is more important than developing a relationship with the person whom you fell in love with. During the first song, called Summer Nights, you can see the difference between Danny's real personality and his personality when he is with his friends. During the song, all the guys sing about is what they did sexually, and asking how good she was, and all that stuff, whereas Sandy and her friends sing more about the falling in love. Sandy describes the lovely things that they did on the beach, and all the fun they had playing around in the water and watching sunsets and such. I think this song really sets the tone for what happens later in the movie, and is foreshadowing the separation between Sandy and Danny. Another time when we see the issue of reputation is when Sandy and Danny first meet after the Pep Rally for the football team. When they first see each other, it's almost like they are genuinely happy to see each other, but then Danny takes a look at his friends, and immediately changes. He acts very stuck up and full of himself, just like his friends expect him to do, which leads into him saying some really stupid, snotty jokes to Sandy. Danny is known for treating girls like toys, and acting like he is the most important person in the relationship. He can't let this sweet little girl ruin his image! This is the first real time where we see the issue of reputation, and how the film portrays it; as something more important than love. This issue is also apparent when they go to the diner. Danny doesn't want to go in, since he doesn't want his friends to see him alone with Sandy, but she insists. Danny is a completely different person when his friends come up and sit with him. He makes jokes and rejects Sandy when she asks him if he wants to meet her parents for tea. In this particular scene, it is apparent that Danny is afraid to show who he really is. He doesn't want his friends to see him love another person. As you can see, there are many scenes in this film that really show the issue of reputation. I get it, your reputation is a big part of high school. You care a lot about what others think of you, and you want to keep your friends, but does this aspect of a reputation mean that you should lose the girl you fell in love with? I don't think so.

It captures you from it's very first second till it's very last, facilitating a high range of emotions throughout the film, yet keeping you equally entertained and comically satisfied from start to finish. The film evokes a meaningful message that enables viewers to more deeply commiserate with the characters alongside their stellar efforts of acting. If you're looking for a comedy to make you fall off the chair, then you are in the right place. In almost every comedy film there is an over- the- top character who over exaggerates normal societal expectations. In this film, this character happens to be Tommy (played by actor and well known comedian, Chris Farley), who we first meet as a young boy. Farley does a remarkable job fulfilling the role of Tommy by going over the top to sell his character. From the first moment you meet Tommy, your attention is drawn to him. When he passes his final exam in the first few minutes of the film, he absentmindedly runs around campus exclaiming with confidence that he got D+ on his final, allowing him to graduate from college after seven long years, respectively. This is just one example where Farley goes out of his way to make Tommy appear as goofy, but also in a credible manner.Tommy isn't aware of the outside world, which evident in his over-the-top attitude that thwarts his ability to properly perceive reality. When his life takes an unexpected turn for the worse, the pressure is on him to save his father's auto part business, leaving both him and his long-time friend, Richard (otherwise known as David Spade), to go on a road trip. Spade expresses the role of Richard as a boring, grumpy businessman who isn't satisfied with himself or his job. His character is presented mostly in the first few minutes of the film when Tommy's father gives Tommy his own office and Richard tells Tommy that he doesn't know the first thing about auto parts in a very demeaning, unequivocal manner. Peter Segal did an outstanding job casting roles and unlike a lot of older movies, the acting is like the story line&#x97; impressive. The plot manifests abrupt changes in the direction it follows, allowing many unpredictable instances to occur along the way. Without giving away the movie, there are characters who switch roles and end up transforming the plot dramatically. This comedy is more than just a series of laughs, it's a compelling series of events that keeps you intrigued throughout the entirety of the film. The movie is unmistakably hilarious, with the exception of softer moments that tie in nicely to the overall film. Tommy's father, otherwise known as Big Tom (Brian Dennehy) announces that he is getting re-married, which is hard for Tommy because of his mother's passing when he was young. Still, he overlooks his father's act of moving on because all Tommy wants is for his father to be happy. When his father dies, respect is gained for Tommy as an acute desire is ignited to save his father's business. Yes, this film isn't one of sadness, but at the same time a message of confidence, self love, and love for others is learned, making the film a lighthearted masterpiece.Tommy Boy is the classic portrayal of a comedy, and should be watched by all who enjoy a good laugh and a phenomenal movie. The acting is exceptional, especially by the one of the world's greatest comedians, Chris Farley, while the story line is structured in an ensuing style to keep you constantly on the edge of your seat.

John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) multi-billionaire and owner of Jurassic Park recruits a group of Paleontologists Dr. Grant (Sam Neil) and his assistant Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) as well as Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to be brought to his amusement park to tour and make sure that it is safe for tourists and that all the dinosaurs are healthy. Unlike anything that has been on the earth, the park located on a remote island called Isla Nublar off the coast of Coasta Rica, it is a zoo of scientifically engineered dinosaurs. Scientists have cracked the prehistoric genetic code, and with help from the genes of living species to fill gaps in the genome, we now have living, breathing, walking and eating dinosaurs. The Paleontologists are flown in via helicopter and we are presented of a beautiful view of the lush green island backed with beautiful music that when I hear takes me back to my earliest memories of watching this movie. Upon arriving on the island Dr. Grant and his associates first encounter a very large Herbivore dinosaur known as a brachiosaurus, they are all blown away, Dr. Grant begins to ramble off scientific facts of the dinosaur as Ian Malcolm can only piece together, its a dinosaur&#x85;you actually did it you crazy son of a bitch. Which is followed by Grant asking Hammond a question about how fast the dinosaur is and Hammond responds with, we clocked the T-Rex at 32 miles per hour. Grant and Sattler are shocked you have a t-Rex??? as their faces are over come with fear, essentially telling us that obviously they don't approve of the idea to bring history's greatest killer another breath. After given a sneak preview of the behind the scenes of the research and scientific engineering complexes, the group is taken in jeeps attached to a monorail system they are taken to all the exhibits before it is open to the public, One of the paleontologists, Malcolm describes a chain of events, God creates dinosaurs, god destroys dinosaurs, god creates man, man destroys god, man creates dinosaur, dinosaur eats man. Further on the exploration of the park the group encounters a sick triceratops gives the Paleontologists an opportunity to view this genetically created behemoth up close and personal, fulfilling every young child's dream of seeing one of these ancient creatures. A tropical storm blows in as the group reaches the next paddock&#x85;the Tyrannosaurus paddock. The power to the park gets knocked out completely, even the electric fences that keep in the dinosaurs are out, 65 million years of Hell is unleashed, and humans are hunted down one by one by raptors and the infamous t-Rex.Spielberg has done a phenomenal job with this film, from script to CGI, he pieced together a beautiful masterpiece. A film that can entertain all ages, as a young kid I idolized Dr. Grant, his knowledge and love for dinosaurs made me want nothing more than to follow in his footsteps and become a paleontologist. Now as an adult I am still fascinated by the visual excitement of the film, the tyrannosaurus Rex chasing down and attacking the gallimimus, the final battle between the raptors and the t-Rex, but now I have a greater knowledge and respect for the craft of Spielberg in creating this film.

William Atherton is a sleazy lawyer associated with the underworld activities.The movie is photographed beautifully in neo-noir coloration, with a high share of night scenes. Both major locations, north and south, are caught distinctively. The director did a great job in staging this movie. One amazing sequence has Gere escaping from gunfire in the Chicago stockyards beneath the hoofs of cattle being stampeded by gunfire. Another has him escaping a bevy of Krabbé's gunmen in an intimidating lowdown drinking\/dancing club.Kim Basinger is impressive as the young woman sold at the age of 13 and belonging to Krabbé ever since. Gere mistakes her for a whore but eventually understands her position. Gere is suitably tough and bold in his quest to track down his partner's murderer.
