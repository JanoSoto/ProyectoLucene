Also, beware of spoilers here in this review!First of all, I'm a big Frank Capra fan, so I'm sentimental. I love feel good movies more than anything. This movie feels like one of those old time movies Mr. Capra would have made.I don't need to give the plot since anyone can discover that. I would just like to mention some of my favorite scenes from the movie that make it a classic in my book! I own the DVD now!What I love most about this movie is the music! Thomas Newman is my favorite composer and he did a masterful job with this movie! I didn't know who he was when I heard this soundtrack and many others. It was a fluke not that long ago that I realized that he was the one who has done by far most of my favorite soundtracks! It was shocking to see how many he did! From Six Feet Under, to The Shawshank Redemption to many more! The best music of all is the first track at the beginning of the movie, which plays throughout the movie everytime John Travolta becomes mesmerized by the trees swaying in the wind. It's been over 7 years since I first saw this movie and I have never forgotten the powerful emotions that these images ignited within me. I still look at trees and nature differently thanks to this much underrated movie! It is one of the best scenes ever in history...in my opinion anyway.*Big SPoiler warning* Another one of my favorite all-time scenes is the scene in the hospital near the end of the movie when John learns his fate. Forest Whitaker, Sedgwick and DuVall have never been better. If you look closely at their performances in the background you will notice true, raw emotion! You can almost feel their pain as they share the tragic news to their friend. Duvall's speech about how he feel in love with George (John's charactor) after taking care of his broken his leg as a kid was wonderful. He ends it with For a man who never had any kids of his own, I feel like I'm losing a son!Then the topper comes when Kyra is alone with John in the hospital room. She tells him that she tried her best not to fall in love with him and he asks her How'd that turn out? and she replies with Terribly! Then he asks her Will you love me for the rest of my life? and she replies with one of the most memorable lines ever in movie history, No...I'm going to love you for the rest of mineAnother amazing and memorable scene comes after that when John shows Kyra how he feels most of the time when he gets lost in bliss while appreciating nature and the dancing trees in the wind. He tells her to imagine holding her newborn baby and rocking it gently when the baby didn't feel well. She closed her eyes and gently rocked the imaginary baby as that hauntingly beautiful song plays.The ending is sad, but so memorable. It's just like real life, really. We will all have sad endings, but what we do while alive and how we are remembered by our loved ones is what matters most. This movie is a blessing.

Laura Linney was outstanding as the only character I really cared for. She was appropriately stern and sympathetic when she needed to be.

Richard Gere's character goes through a lot of tragic times - boo hoo. Watching a character go through bad times does not a developed character make, you have to put in those moments that really show the despair or anger the character is feeling and we get none of this from the film. I didn't mind whether Gere's character lived or died and wasn't really all that interested anyway. Also, what the hell was up with Will Patton's character? He couldn't decide whether Gere was stalking his family or whether he was a good guy to be trusted. Make up your mind dude!--I have said many times that I love getting information and learning new things out of films and I was expecting to learn about the Mothman during my theatre visit to this film.

While their acting was good, I don't think the roles were that challenging for Tommy Lee Jones or Anne Heche.  The film based upon the trailers, would make you think this was going to be a movie of much more high drama and specific human interest that we tend to associate with fictional disaster movies, like The Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno, or The Day After (TV Mini-Series), but it never really evolved into that - either because the stories we're strong enough or because of the way the movie was produced.  This film is more like a well-timed chase film, except instead of bad guys we're chasing a lava flow through Los Angeles.  While interesting, I think they needed to either focus more on the human interest and scientific aspects of this catastrophe or on the problem-solving aspects.  It just seem like there was so much material in this movie that things ended up getting spread to thin.  Maybe it was done in an attempt to enhance people's understanding of what was going on in the movie, but I felt that things could have been more integrated so that information about people and science happened together somehow.The one thing I really found annoying about this movie was Mike Roark's (Jones) daughter, Kelly (Gaby Hoffman).  This character is the human embodiment of a deer in high beam headlights.  Not once, but twice does she almost get her father (Jones) killed during the movie, because she can't seem to move her feet in the face of imminent danger and death.  While I will agree that it is incomprehensible to the normal human mind to see lava running down a street in Los Angeles, I definitely don't think (and really hope) that most people would run away from the lava and not just stand there as its 10 feet away from them.Overall, I found the movie to be solid.  I haven't researched the scientific facts to see if they all agree with reality, but just using common sense and a little of the scientific knowledge I posses, I was able to find nothing unbelievable or illogical about what they were saying was happening, which to me is what made this movie slightly better than average.  If you see this movie you'll most likely enjoy it, but if you miss it you won't be hearing about it from everyone else except the diehards.  Its your call - to see or not to see.

The film based upon the trailers, would make you think this was going to be a movie of much more high drama and specific human interest that we tend to associate with fictional disaster movies, like The Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno, or The Day After (TV Mini-Series), but it never really evolved into that - either because the stories we're strong enough or because of the way the movie was produced.  This film is more like a well-timed chase film, except instead of bad guys we're chasing a lava flow through Los Angeles.  While interesting, I think they needed to either focus more on the human interest and scientific aspects of this catastrophe or on the problem-solving aspects.  It just seem like there was so much material in this movie that things ended up getting spread to thin.  Maybe it was done in an attempt to enhance people's understanding of what was going on in the movie, but I felt that things could have been more integrated so that information about people and science happened together somehow.The one thing I really found annoying about this movie was Mike Roark's (Jones) daughter, Kelly (Gaby Hoffman).  This character is the human embodiment of a deer in high beam headlights.  Not once, but twice does she almost get her father (Jones) killed during the movie, because she can't seem to move her feet in the face of imminent danger and death.  While I will agree that it is incomprehensible to the normal human mind to see lava running down a street in Los Angeles, I definitely don't think (and really hope) that most people would run away from the lava and not just stand there as its 10 feet away from them.Overall, I found the movie to be solid.  I haven't researched the scientific facts to see if they all agree with reality, but just using common sense and a little of the scientific knowledge I posses, I was able to find nothing unbelievable or illogical about what they were saying was happening, which to me is what made this movie slightly better than average.  If you see this movie you'll most likely enjoy it, but if you miss it you won't be hearing about it from everyone else except the diehards.  Its your call - to see or not to see.

We see how her sister is killed and raped, in that order, and how she finds a sword. She thinks this is one of the signs from God; we get to see some more. Whether they really are signs the movie kind of leaves in the middle with the appearance of something like her conscience (Dustin Hoffman). We see  how she gets her own army, has success, but is captured after Charles VII (John Malkovich) is crowned as the king of France and doesn't really support her anymore. As most people know Joan of Arc was burned alive when she was only 19 years old.Milla Jovovich plays the older Joan. Director Luc Besson also used her for his 'The Fifth Element' and although she is not really bad here she was better in her element in that first movie. Luc Besson was actually the reason I went to see this movie, after his great 'Léon' and the goofy 'The Fifth Element'. He didn't disappoint me with his direction, but he did with the movie.

It does create a creepy atmosphere with a nice visual style and therefore the movie was good enough for me. I was hoping for a little more of Joan of Arc and her life but I guess you can't have it all.We begin with Joan when she is still young, played by Jane Valentine in a very good way. We see how her sister is killed and raped, in that order, and how she finds a sword. She thinks this is one of the signs from God; we get to see some more. Whether they really are signs the movie kind of leaves in the middle with the appearance of something like her conscience (Dustin Hoffman). We see  how she gets her own army, has success, but is captured after Charles VII (John Malkovich) is crowned as the king of France and doesn't really support her anymore. As most people know Joan of Arc was burned alive when she was only 19 years old.Milla Jovovich plays the older Joan. Director Luc Besson also used her for his 'The Fifth Element' and although she is not really bad here she was better in her element in that first movie.

On the one hand, we have a great superhero film with excellent special effects and moments that delight and inspire.  On the other hand, we have a sequel that fails to equal the power of its predecessors and has moments that provoke anger and confusion. Indeed, Superman III is a guilty pleasure at best and a major let down at worst.The changes begin at the opening credits.  If you're a fan of the first two films, you're naturally expecting something spectacular and semi-cosmic. Not so with this film.  The credits slide across the bottom of the screen as a series of slapstick comedy incidents play out on screen.  This is one of the movie's more perplexing and less favourable moments.  The scene is played for laughs, which along with being a radical change in tone from the first two entries, fails to humour at all.  This is the film's rough start, and is likely to turn off many people to Superman III instantly.The most recognizable change in the series is the presence of Richard Pryor. What can I say?  Pryor is hilarious.  Watching him is a great experience, but he seems terribly out of place in a Superman film.  Sometimes his Gus Gorman character is a delight, other times it is an annoyance.  He receives way too much screen time, and in many instances Superman III appears to be more of a Pryor film than a Superman one.  However, there are other times where Pryor shines as a good addition.  He portrays the innocent, well-meaning, manipulated character of Gorman quite well, but these moments are few and far between.Superman III also includes the addition of an evil Superman, and this is where the film gets very interesting.  When the Man of Steel is exposed to synthetic kryptonite laced with tobacco tar (via Gus Gorman), he is twisted into a dark, corrupted Superman.  Christopher Reeve portrays this change beautifully and leaves with the impression that the new Superman is truly a force of menavolent darkness.  After a few scenes displaying his new anti-heroic disposition, the dark Superman and good Clark Kent face off in a junkyard.  This is easily the highlight of Superman III, and probably one of the major highlights of the entire Superman series.  Whether or not the fight is occuring in reality or in the minds of the characters is ambiguous, but the visuals that result are fantastic.  This leads us to the movie's most inspiring moment.  After defeating the evil Superman, Clark rips open his shirt and reveals the clean S shield underneath and flies out of the junkyard.  It is a great cinematic moment as well as a great Superman moment.Superman III's final battle is, well, rather anticlimatic.  Superman faces off with a giant super computer that has a mind of its own.  Great concept, but it's executed fairly poorly on the screen.  All of the effects and ingenuity appeared to go into making the technological colossus come to life instead of creating an entertaining fight sequence.  In the end, Superman wins using brains instead of brawn.  This seemed to be a cop-out on the part of the writers and producers, and the ending seems rushed and ill-planned. What we are left with is a film that starts and ends on a bad note.Overall, Superman III is a mediocre Superman movie.  Although it has outstanding special effects and a few moments that show that it is indeed a Superman film, it lacks the heart and verisimilitude of the first two. However, the movie does not deserve the burning it generally receives from critics, either.  Christopher Reeve delivers another stunning performance as Kent and Superman and Annette O'Toole is charming as Lana Lang.  The Man of Steel would not appear on the big screen again for four more years, with decidedly mixed results.

Unfortunately, it was released into a world expecting shallow, brainless thrillers, and pointless vanity pieces from untalented actors and directors. The public at large had no idea what to make of this very fine work when it hit theaters in 1999. pointless is the word I kept hearing from anyone who saw it before I did. Such a shame.Eyes wide shut is like most of Kubrick's work. It flows like a stream happy to be churning along at its own pace. One cannot simply dangle their toes into the water and get a true feeling for it though. You must jump all the way in and let it take you for a ride. That said, I still think the pace of this film was a little too slow. I think the point could have been made, along with all of the emotions being conveyed, in under two hours. Some of the scenes drag out for a few minutes longer than they need to.The acting was a little stiff, and at times unconvincing. Tom Cruise, however, does and outstanding job. He really carries this film a lot longer than a host of other leading men could have. Kidman really didn't impress me with her performance. She isn't in nearly as many scenes as Cruise, and she comes off as being kind of ditzy in the ones she's in. Not just in the one where they smoke pot. None of the supporting performances are all that memorable either, but they probably weren't meant to be.The story is what really makes this one so memorable. We see a confident, professional man driven to near madness when his wife admits to fantasizing about leaving him and their child for another man she only saw briefly at a hotel. Cruise is understandably upset by this revelation, and sets out to get laid to spite her with anyone he can find. He wanders the streets for hours, and eventually ends up at some wild orgy at a country mansion. Then, things really get interesting.The film is like most Kubrick films in that it is technically awesome and emotionally ambiguous. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide what constitutes adultery and what can simply be written off as a harmless dream or fantasy. One could have a conversation with someone else about these issues for hours and hours.I must take issue with one of the ideas expressed in this film. Kidman's character would have us believe that women are just as much after sex as men, and that they are just as capable of committing adulterous thoughts and actions as men. WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! If you women thought about sex or wanted to have sex as mush as us guys, the world would cease to function. That orgy at the country mansion would be happening all over the world non-stop. Overall, a clever, thoughtful film that should be in any DVD collection. I would stop short of calling it a masterpiece, though. It just falls a little short of that distinction.ps There are a lot of hot women in this film. Notice how all of them (including Nicole) are tall with perfect breasts. My compliments to the casting director!8 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound.
