Now he's a detective who gets called in on a murder case when a copy of his priestly thesis on angels is found at the scene. Thomas finds a body that has no eyes, both sets of sex organs, blood like a fetus and bones unlike any living thing on Earth. He also finds a handwritten bible from the 2nd century that has an extra chapter of Revelations, one that tells of a terrible war in Heaven where angels rebelled over God's love of Man.His investigation leads Thomas to a dying town in Arizona, where a choir teacher named Katherine Hammond (Virginia Madsen) is worried about a little girl named Mary (Moriah Shining Dove Snyder), who's been sick ever since she met a strange man named Simon (Eric Stoltz). Except, Simon isn't a man. He's an angel and he's trying to keep the Archangel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) from finding something he needs to win the war in Heaven and displace Man as God's favorite creation. With help from an unlikely source, Thomas and Katherine have to protect Mary and end the angelic war.The best way to describe The Prophecy is to say that the stuff in this movie that works, really works, but there's a lot of stuff in the film that doesn't work at all. Widen creates an amazingly textured angel mythology that doesn't just deal with what they are but how they act, think and feel. What George Romero did with zombies, that's what Widen does with angels. There's a bit in the story about how Gabriel finds dying people and keeps them alive to serve him doing dumb monkey work like driving a car which Gabriel feels is beneath him. It's a little detail in this story, but you could make an entire movie out of that idea. That's the level of care and attention that Widen brings to that element of the movie.Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz and Viggo Mortensen also do excellent jobs playing characters that are both more and less than human. Walken is particularly outstanding with a role that's always balanced on the edge of self-parody. He embraces the excessive aspects of Gabriel and channels them in a way that keeps the audience on its toes.This is also a good looking film. It's very stylish without looking stylized. From the angels on Earth in their long coats to Heaven's fields of the dead to the simple image of an old man standing behind a young girl, Widen has a distinct vision that is appealing without becoming labored or overwhelming.Unfortunately, things go wrong when Widen crams into the story two human characters that neither he nor the viewer really care about. There's nothing wrong with Elias Koteas or Virginia Madsen, but the characters of Thomas and Katherine are non-entities. They never do anything and aren't needed. This movie could have focused entirely on the angels and it would have been fine, but either Widen or his producers obviously thought there had to be some normal characters for the audience to identify with. It's hard to identify with characters that stand around while stuff happens around them.The Prophecy has one of the dumber endings you'll see, as well. The story poses a lot of compelling moral, ethical and theological questions, then resolves them by hitting a guy in the head with a crowbar over and over. It's like they ran out of time to come up with something, so they borrowed the ending they saw on an episode of the A-Team the night before filming the final scene.The Prophecy is a lot like Highlander. There are things in this movie you will absolutely love and there are things that wither and die on screen like a plague victim. This is one of those films that was made for DVD, so you can get watch the good bits and forget about the rest.

But I never understood the appeal, even then. A series of 1950s pastiche songs permanently in the charts made this the last film in the world I'd want to see. It was one of those inexplicable and inescapable pop culture phenomena which annoyed the hell out of everyone who was not enraptured by it.Seeing it for the first time all these years later, I have tried to take as unprejudiced a view as I can. I have tried to watch it a few times before, but always found it leaden and predictable. The music is not the only cliché-ridden thing in it, indeed it consists of nothing more than a series of 1950s clichés strung together. Two rival gangs (safely sanitised naturally). A school dance. A drive-in movie. A car race. Looks like the authors watched Rebel Without A Cause and Westside Story and blended them together. Minus any of the threat inherent in those works of course. Danny's gang sound and act like Top Cat's gang from the 70s cartoon.It might be said that these things have become 50s clichés because they were so prevalent at the time. Fair enough. But these scenes have no organic connection with each other. You just feel the writers say what shall we do now? I know, let's have a song about a t-bird, they had those in the 50s. Nothing has any real consequence in this film nor is there any character development. One girl has unprotected sex and for a time thinks she's pregnant. Then it turns out she's not. Yippee.Sandy wants to be respected by Danny. But has a volte-face after seeing him win a car race. She then turns into the local skank and comes onto him, which would drive most men to run a mile. Its lucky this is set in the 1950s when the worst vice was smoking; if it were set today, she would turn into a crack whore.All of this could be countered with the fact that this is not a plot or character driven film but a musical, and the plot merely exists to hang a series of set pieces on. After all many musicals of Hollywood's golden age have laughable plots merely designed to frame spectacular song and dance routines. So that brings us back to the quality of the songs themselves. Are they good enough that we can overlook the film's obvious faults? Well Summer nights and You're the one that I want are good songs and produce the most memorable scenes. There is nothing spectacular or even inventive about them in the manner of old Fred and Ginger numbers, however. The other songs are largely forgettable but I do like the production beauty school dropout which is the most imaginative thing in the film.Worst of all is the title track which stands out like a sore thumb. It is a disco-era song, completely at variance with the rest of the music. And its lyrics are incomprehensible. Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion and grease is the way we are feeling would rank high as the most mindless ever written.Ultimately this is very non-threatening entertainment.

The professional is about a hit-man Leon (Jean Reno) who befriends young Mathilda (Natalie Portman) after her family is murdered. Mathilda decides she wants revenge and insists Leon teach her how to clean. A very touching relationship then develops between the two which is at the center of this amazing film. I really love this movie!I need to comment on the actors here. This is the first time I saw Ms. Portman on film was captivated by her from the first time I saw The Professional (and have been ever since in 'Beautiful girls', V for vendetta,'Black Swan' etc). Mathilda has had a tough life, her father and older sister were both abusive to her and her step-mother didn't seem to care. She hated the school she attended and liked to hang out on the stairway of her apartment building sneaking cigarettes. Portman plays her as vulnerable, distressed yet strong and endearing...and totally believable the whole way.Then there's Gary Oldman, who in my opinion is absolutely the finest character actor in movies over the last 20 years or so. I've never seen him give a bad performance (he was especially great in the 1990 film State of Grace). Oldman here delivers what may be his best performance ever as the sleazy, psychotic DEA agent Stansfield. We watch him chew on his mysterious pills while cracking his neck and listen as he obsesses with Beethoven and think...wow! this is one of the creepiest characters ever put on film. During the climactic scene he tells an assistant to send me everyone and the assistant incredulously asks everyone? to which Stansfield chillingly screams EVERYONE!!...we get the point, the guy is nuts but has power...and cops show up in droves.I don't mean to underrate Reno's performance here, he is quietly brilliant, the best I've ever seen of him to date. Leon doesn't have a whole lot of dialog as the professional, and thats by design as the character is Italian and we presume he hasn't been in the United States for long and doesn't know a whole lot of English. Reno is perfect in the role, and when he delivers that signature line I quoted above...this is from Mathilda...it packs a powerful and emotional punch. It's a truly great payoff scene.This is not necessarily a movie with a happy ending, but this isn't meant to be a feel-good movie, it's bigger than that. However, it IS very satisfying and a nice symbolic scene at the end on the lawn of Mathilda's new school ties it all up very nicely. If you are choking back tears, you are not alone.Real nice song by Sting shape of my heart over the closing credits caps it off..Enjoy.

I really love this movie!I need to comment on the actors here. This is the first time I saw Ms. Portman on film was captivated by her from the first time I saw The Professional (and have been ever since in 'Beautiful girls', V for vendetta,'Black Swan' etc). Mathilda has had a tough life, her father and older sister were both abusive to her and her step-mother didn't seem to care. She hated the school she attended and liked to hang out on the stairway of her apartment building sneaking cigarettes. Portman plays her as vulnerable, distressed yet strong and endearing...and totally believable the whole way.Then there's Gary Oldman, who in my opinion is absolutely the finest character actor in movies over the last 20 years or so. I've never seen him give a bad performance (he was especially great in the 1990 film State of Grace). Oldman here delivers what may be his best performance ever as the sleazy, psychotic DEA agent Stansfield. We watch him chew on his mysterious pills while cracking his neck and listen as he obsesses with Beethoven and think...wow! this is one of the creepiest characters ever put on film. During the climactic scene he tells an assistant to send me everyone and the assistant incredulously asks everyone? to which Stansfield chillingly screams EVERYONE!!...we get the point, the guy is nuts but has power...and cops show up in droves.I don't mean to underrate Reno's performance here, he is quietly brilliant, the best I've ever seen of him to date. Leon doesn't have a whole lot of dialog as the professional, and thats by design as the character is Italian and we presume he hasn't been in the United States for long and doesn't know a whole lot of English. Reno is perfect in the role, and when he delivers that signature line I quoted above...this is from Mathilda...it packs a powerful and emotional punch. It's a truly great payoff scene.This is not necessarily a movie with a happy ending, but this isn't meant to be a feel-good movie, it's bigger than that. However, it IS very satisfying and a nice symbolic scene at the end on the lawn of Mathilda's new school ties it all up very nicely. If you are choking back tears, you are not alone.Real nice song by Sting shape of my heart over the closing credits caps it off..Enjoy.

Is easily one of the funniest and most influential comedies ever made. Not the first parody film but it did take them in a new direction. It was done with more genius than almost every comedy made before and after, and it will remain a classic forever. It is jam packed with gags and one liners that would make Groucho Marx proudThere really isn't anything bad to say about this film. Immature? Yeah, sure, but still funny to almost everyone regardless of taste. Its easily the best comedy of the 80s if not the best comedy ever made. It doesn't get annoying like many other films in its style, it stays hilarious the whole time, and it will be hilarious for years and years to come. I don't think Leslie Nielson would be remembered the way he will be without this film. He plays one of the greatest comedy roles ever, and with the help of Robert Hays, Lloyd Bridges, Julie Hagerty, Peter Graves, and Kareem Abdul Jabbar, this film becomes legendary. There is truly too many great lines to even begin picking favorites. Now, is Airplane my favorite comedy? No. I'm not going to sit here and say I love it to death. Don't get me wrong, I do love it and I do think it is one of the greatest comedies ever made, but at the same time, as far as comedies go, I wont call it one of my favorites unless I can watch over and over again. It does stay funny even after multiple viewings but they need to be pretty separated viewings, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just the only thing that keeps me from loving it a little more. Still genius. If you haven't yet seen Airplane! You have made a mistake. It is a must see by everyone. Make sure you are in the mood for a comedy though. It is one of the few full blown comedies that are both loved by almost everyone and seen as a classic. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 October 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Airplane!

Nicholas Cage plays Rick Santoro, a crooked cop with a big mouth and an over-inflated opinion of himself. He's assigned to assist an old friend and Naval officer named Kevin Dunn (Gary Sinese at his shifty-eyed best) who's guarding the Secretary of Defense at a heavyweight championship bout in a crowded and manic Atlantic City casino. They're an unlikely match and polar opposites even though the script calls for them to be long-time best friends. Chaos ensues when the Secretary is assassinated by an unknown assailant and De Palma's fancy camera work involves viewers in a deluge of subplots and suspicious characters. The confusion doesn't prevent Cage and Sinese from trying to begin their investigation and fit the pieces together. Video cameras are soon employed to check out every angle of the casino and De Palma has his usual fun with the latest technologies. Unfortunately, Snake Eyes plays its hand too early and the bad guy comes out of the woodwork midway through the film. And where are the Federal Agents? A Secretary of Defense is killed and the crime scene is left to a crooked cop and a junior Naval officer? That implausible scenario is only the first of many that occupy the second half of the movie and quickly sink it to the bottom of the Atlantic. To add to the already convoluted plot, the assassination revolves around a flawed missile weapons system, a whistle-blower (Carla Gugino looking like a million dollars), a fixed fight (Stan Shaw taking a dive) and a megalomaniac Defense department official (John Heard). Reality is stretched well beyond the limit and all of De Palma's technical skills simply can't hide that fact. Cage's character, in particular, defies logic. His swift character change from cop on the take to moral sterling behavior isn't explained to any degree and just doesn't make sense. One moment he's mugging someone and in the next he's trying to save the world from corruption. At least Sinese's character tries to justify his actions although his excuses ring hollow. And hollow is what most viewers will feel after sitting through this shallow attempt by De Palma to emulate his hero, the great Alfred Hitchcock.

Basically Peggy Sue Bodell née Kelcher (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Kathleen Turner) is now forty three year old, married and has daughter Beth (Helen Hunt), and is attending a high school reunion. In the evening she is voted the queen of the reunion, alongside king Richard Norvik (Barry Miller), being the most popular high school student, and in her excitement she faints. When she wakes up, Peggy Sue is younger and has been somehow transported twenty-years into the past, 1960, back to high school, and she has apparently woken from donating blood. After initially being very concerned that she has died and wants to get back to her own time, she tries to settle to her past surroundings and change her future. Besides helping maybe one or two of her friends with what will determine their futures, Peggy Sue's main concern is changing her future with the man who will be her husband in a miserable marriage, Charlie Bodell (Nicolas Cage, Coppola's nephew). Peggy Sue may know the future, but she at times really questions whether she should change it for herself and others, especially as she is discovering why she fell in love Charlie in the first place. After many encounters with some past events and friends, including Carol Heath (Child's Play's Catherine Hicks), Maddy Nagle (The Bourne Supremacy's Joan Allen), Walter Getz (Jim Carrey) and Nancy Kelcher (Sofia Coppola), there is a low point and argument. In the end though, Peggy Sue goes with the future she initially chose with Charlie, but in a much understanding way and aware of daughter Beth, and of course she wakes up back in 1985 where she belongs. Also starring Kevin J.

Sometimes sad, sometimes hilarious, but always amazing. I suggest this film to everyone. I think if you give it a chance there is almost no way you wont like it. The Apartment is one more film that proves Billy Wilder is one of the best directors in history. 10\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"8 October 2010","score":"","review":" The Apartment (1960)Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder team up again for brilliance. I don't like The Apartment quite as much as I do Some Like it Hot but it still is one of the greatest films of all time. It is very clever, sweet and funny, and has fantastic performances by both Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine. The supporting cast all does good as well. Along with the great acting, The Apartment has outstanding writing and directing by legend Billy Wilder. As I said it isn't my favorite Billy Wilder film but it is one of the best, which automatically means its one of the best films ever made. Billy Wilder is a genius.

Well made horror movie full of black humor and a bit of gore where numerous people meet horrible deaths by a despicable avenger named Doctor Phibes (exceptional Vincent Price), causing wreak havoc and bizarre murders wherever he goes . A series of grisly killings are happening and Police (Peter Jeffreys) is investigating the deeds , as several of the roles come to a sticky final . Dr Phibes goes on his quest to avenge his beloved wife (Caroline Munro in photograph ) . After being disfigured in a car crash , Phibes decides to seeks revenge against the members of a surgical team (whose chief is Joseph Cotten) and he seems to dispatch new weird death , committing inventive crimes and killing every few minutes of the movie with the assistance of his lovely companion ( a delectable Virginia North). Camp terror movie with charismatic performance of excellent protagonists , Vincent Price and Joseph Cotten , and all around with special mention to Peter Jeffrey as intelligent Inspector . Vincent is excellent as master of menace , the picture is specifically devoted to the particular talents of Price. Vincent continued to play various films in similar style shot at England as ¨Theatre of blood¨ , ¨Madhouse¨ , and the following ¨Dr Phibes rises again¨ . Terry Thomas also have a splendid time in this vivid flick of a doctor's vendetta . The chief excitement lies in seeing what new and amazing victim can be dreamt by the campy effects, in fact, the murders parallel those in the Biblical plagues . The movie's intelligence , adequate Fx , rare score, luxurious photography all combined to make it a 70s horror classic and its influence cannot be overstated . Colorful cinematography by Norman Warwick and modernist production design in Art Nouveau or Decó style . This delightful motion picture is well produced by American International -James H Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff- and compellingly directed by Robert Fuest . This is a top-drawer black horror with a strong genre cast should the terror fans'attention . It's followed by a good sequel titled ¨Dr Phibes rises again¨ again by Robert Fuest and Vincent Price in which Phibes attempts to revive his beloved wife and going on vengeance on those he thinks responsible for her death .
