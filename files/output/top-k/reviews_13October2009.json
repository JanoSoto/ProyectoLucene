You know the kind. It's a movie that if you didn't see it in the theaters, you had to see on video. Or, as is the case now in the 21st century thanks to Anchor Bay, on DVD. And you may not see it right away since it isn't a name brand like a Freddy or Michael Myers, or with the pedigree of Sam Raimi. You have to look into finding this one out (that, or pay attention to the movie conversation between Spacey and Bentley in American Beauty when stoned). But once you see it, it's another reminder of how sick and twisted and hilarious a film can be when its creators keep logic dangling by a thread - sure, some of this is logical, but that's after setting up the 'fact' that people can come back to life by some weird green liquid that one isn't really sure how it's made but, hey, it's Herbert West so maybe you just don't want to know...Simple premise Herbert West (Herbert to his friends) is at a medical school when he takes a room with Dan and Megan, an engaged couple who also are connected to the medical university (Dan also a student, Megan daughter of the uptight dean), and tries out his formula to extend life past the expected amount of time the brain can function after death. Turns out it works, first on a cat, then on something... else, like say a huge muscle man in a morgue! From here on its turns into a match of wills - Herbert West versus the vindictive and power hungry Dr. Carl Hill, who wants nothing but to take West's formula - and then when dead and a severed head, to create a zombie army that only he can control through lobotomies... yeah, still crazy? Just you wait.This is the stuff 'cult' is made of in the film world. You watch it and realize as you're laughing and cringing that you're almost part of a club when watching this. It's a splatter-fest, coupling the ribald gore of a B (or Z) grade horror movie with some of the dread one maybe found in the original Lovecraft story. Some of the movie is just too bizarre and weird to totally qualify as comedy, or some of it just so much that it goes even further (or at least toe-to-toe) than its other 1985 zombie-comedy, Return of the Living Dead. But probably the best assets to make it crazy-funny as opposed to just crazy is David Gale as Carl Hill (mostly after he's a severed head and body, doing more campy takes than one could ever ask for outside of Bela Lugosi), and Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West. Combs is so good here at projecting this determined, insane but almost admirably passionate *scientists* that it's a shame then he only has one other stand-out performance - as a crazy agent in the Frighteners.Sure, the acting by the two leads isn't always at its best from Bruce Abbott (good at one stare, not so much on dialog except for a few key scenes) or Barbara Crampton (a good screamer and a sexy body, but also on par with Abbott for talent), but this is the least thing to worry about as they're supposed to be the bland-leads. What makes the film so incredible and enduring since its release is its attention to real horror - the body that is just there in the background BOLTS UP oh no! - and some real insane comedy. It's not exactly a spoof either, since it's so daring in its subversion of the Frankenstein formula. It is what a die-hard genre fan is salivating for, pun intended bloody fun, with chunks, the thicker the better. 9.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 October 2009","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Re-Animator is one of those super-duper-holy-s***-WTF horror movies.

This today still I note this, that's how impressive both films are at it (and indeed Rick Baker worked on this one for a short while before transitioning over to 'London'). Fans and admirers can argue about the merits or flaws in each film - neither one is entirely perfect - but they are both solid films. In the case of Joe Dante's effort, with the help of co-screenwriter John Sayles, his film mostly trumps comedy for horror. This isn't to say that little moments of hilarity or just random absurdity sprout up from time to time. He creates with his crew such an immediate effect of atmosphere that everything else that comes with it works that much better. It's a creepy little movie.It's about a newscaster (Dee Wallace) who got a kind of close encounter with a serial killer, whom she tracked down for a story to a porno shop and who nearly killed her until the cops come and shoot the man\/thing. But then she keeps getting visions of what she saw- or didn't see- and is told by her doctor to go up to The Colony, to relax for a couple of weeks and sit in on some therapy sessions with other people who experienced a similar occurrence. She also goes with her husband, which for him turns out not so well as he's attacked at night by a wolf... which, in turn, makes him one. What we see, and what makes for a nice twist on the conventions of werewolf movies, is that the people don't need to wait for dark or even a full moon to transform, and it's pretty hard to kill it without silver (that last convention still sticks, though to a great result late in the film).What unfolds at this Colony, and in the newscaster's friends' search to find out more about these werewolves and how to kill them, is intriguing stuff, and it's filmed by Dante often with a clever knack for shifting between satire and serious horror. There's a scene at a bonfire on a beach when Karen first comes to the Colony, and we see an old man muttering to himself that he can't go on and threatens to do himself in. This scene is almost funny just by how the guy playing the old man acts and speaks, but it's not a funny scene in the slightest. And when it comes time for Dante and his main make-up guy Rob Bottin (one year before working on The Thing) get to showing what these creatures look like, it's spine-tingling and sometimes bizarre (i.e. werewolf sex scene).If it suffers from anything it's sometimes an almost too-much reliance on in-jokes (sometimes it works like with the Big Bad Wolf cartoon on TV, but a copy of Howl on a desk is a little much), and not the firmest control of the narrative early on in the film (the first ten minutes seem sort of shaky until Karen gets into the porno store). When it gets to the Colony it sticks to being weird and terrifying, and for all of its acting being over the top (Slim Pickens) or flat (Dee Wallace) what counts is its tone and mood. It's more self-conscious about its genre than parody, and it displays how wonderful a filmmaker Joe Dante was right before his big hit with Gremlins.

I just think it's kind of silly. But besides that, I liked the film.It's got a good cast. Including Jeff Daniels, Joley Richardson, and Hugh Laurie as a villain who tries to steal the dogs. Or a henchmen whatever. I know it's not a great movie but you know what, I still give it a thumbs up.101 Dalmations***\/**** ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family"},{"date":"13 October 2009","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I was always intrigued by this movie because of the beautiful songs.

But for people old enough to remember having met or known people like the characters in this film (which is also a classic play by Terence Rattigan, revived from time to time on stage), this is a harrowing, searing examination of the interior recesses of fossilised people in a formal society of manners such as England was before the 1960s. The play\/film is set in a seaside hotel at Bournemouth in England in the 1950s. It is peopled by lonely, stiff upper lip people who sit at separate tables in the communal dining room. The performances by numerous famous actors are absolutely staggering. David Niven gives certainly his finest performance in any film, well deserving his Oscar. Deborah Kerr leaves our jaws agape at her wholly convincing portrayal of a cringeing, crushed daughter of a tyrant mother who despite having entered middle age still says simperingly 'Yes Mummy, No Mummy' and is afraid of her own shadow. The film is actually dominated by two older women on the one hand, Gladys Cooper tyrannizes over the entire cast of characters with her Olympian certainties, pernicious control freakery, destructive and sadistic cruelty, all masked by 'proper manners', a 'concern for morality', and a view of herself as representative of a superior class of being, not to mention the upper class of society. She is one of those elegantly dressed older women who used to dominate all around them, gave themselves the airs of duchesses, or at least of the duchesses they imagined (since they had probably never met one), and who carried snobbery to its greatest heights. Cooper absolutely dominates the screen in every shot, and her arched brow or wrinkled nose of disapproval is enough to terrify a pontiff. And then there is the calm, emotionally ravaged, but practical and efficient hotelier, played by Wendy Hiller. She dominates her own scenes in turn, with her unique charm, and she well deserved her Oscar too. Poor Wendy has been in love with Burt Lancaster for years. But then his ex-wife Rita Hayworth turns up, whose cold glamour casts an arctic spell, and the intensity of her needs and her egotism threaten to turn the proceedings to ice, which will shatter into shards and leave everyone chilled at the heart.

All of the characters' feelings are suppressed, all of their upper lips are as stiff as boards, all of their hearts are breaking, everything is appearance, but beneath the appearance there are the unheard screams, the cries, the agonies, the concealed feelings, and the sobs that are never heard because never uttered. The days when people could control themselves (albeit so often too much so, as we see here) are long gone. Nowadays it all hangs out, every last bit of it. Nothing is concealed any longer. And yet here we see a tableau of self-control presented to our eyes to remind us what everything was like just a short time ago, well within the living memories of half the people on the planet.

That makes it seem more life-like to me when you're not quite sure where it's going and if\/when the CLImax is coming.This is a pretty charming film with Dave being romantically and innocently in love with his life while everyone else is unsure and depressed.The script, the dialogue, the parents, the cat, the old woman on the porch, the one-liners by Stern, Haley's charm and passion, Quaid's facade and insecurity, the breeziness of Dennis Christopher and his loss of innocence to those free-wheeling italianos- everything comes together to make this a fun, inspiring film.When the pimply short guy jumps on the bike because the tall, well-built ex-quarterback doesn't have the guts then rides for his life, barely able to reach the pedals- it makes you want to cry.This is an excellently charming, inspiring film.

Basically cool kid Richard Haywood (Half Nelson's Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Bully's Michael Pitt) team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them. Investigating the murder is homicide detective Cassie 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene, e.g. non-relating hairs. The plan doesn't seem to be completely going well because Cassie and Sam do quite quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects, it is just a question of if they can sway them away. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. Al Swanson. I can see now the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Rope with the murdering for a challenge thing, but this film does it in a very silly way, and not even a reasonably good Bullock can save it from being dull and predictable. Adequate!

Is it funny? No, unless you find constant swearing, vulgar sexual references, pigs, dogs, unnecessary violence, and overblown close-ups funny. Oh, yes, there are cute melodies here and there as a bonus and tons of extras on the DVD. Is there any significant contribution of such flicks to cinema as a form of art? Hardly. Such movies are like a spit upon the audience. All right, I spit back devour your pig faeces yourself, Mr Guy Ritchie. It's another vivid example how IMDb Top 250 representatives can suck.It makes me watching Lock, Stock... absolutely out of question. I'm quite sure it's a piece of English pig crap too (no offence to England in general here of course). The sad thing to me is that, judging by IMDb, crowds of people praise such movies. I would choose the dumbest melodrama instead of watching this one.Could this movie be a better one? Sure ass! With pigs, dogs, certain scenes thrown away, any similarity with Tarantino\/Kusturica stuff eradicated, it would have become a watchable action. But tastes differ of course.It's easy to rate this screened pig-crap 1 out of 10. Thanks for attention.
