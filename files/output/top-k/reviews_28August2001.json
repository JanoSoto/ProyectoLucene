Either it is a story that gets new twists or new action (the upcoming The Musketeer), or it has been put into a modern setting. O is of the latter type of story--yet it is as effective set in the modern era as it is set in days of old. Based on Othello by William Shakespeare, this tale of emotions driven to their breaking point has been masterfully directed by Tim Blake Nelson. There could have been many ways for him to tell this story; it could have spiraled down to a typical teen movie (i.e., cool characters who say smart and sassy things, or the love story proves triumphant), or it could have been turned into an extremely violent tale, which would fade into the background of American cinema as just yet another bloody fable and something for which parents might blame real-life tragedy (which, sadly, might be the case with this film). The R rating is well deserved--there is rough language and violence, including one disturbing image of a self-inflicted gunshot and a romantic night gone wrong. Yet, when viewed in context of the movie, it's a wonder that director Nelson didn't choose to show anything more graphic than necessary. There were many points where he was given the opportunity, and the violence that is in the film is definitely severe, but he didn't go that route. Instead, he focused more on the story and the characters, which I greatly appreciated. This film was apparently the target of a lot of controversy over its supposed Columbine-esque violence; however, this is more of a calculated, focused rage that has its place in the story. This is not carried out by kids who saw this as the ultimate revenge against bullies--it is overprivileged children who see that whatever they want in the world, they should have. These killings are not the random, point and let the bullets fly kind; each has its own meaning and purpose, however sad it may be.(NOTE I'm not belittling the tragedy that was Columbine. Violence of any kind has no place in our schools.)It's hard to try to put Othello into a modern setting, much less a high school setting, where you're just finding out who you are and what you're capable of. The characters are extremely adult, yet childish with their selfish wants and actions. The actors give terrifically brooding and often scary portrayals of their characters. As the boy who is driven mad with jealousy, Mekhi Pfifer (as Odin, or O) draws you in and makes you see the wheels spinning in his head and what they're doing to him. Josh Hartnett gives a chilling performance as Hugo, a kid devoid of emotion and conscience. And as the innocent, Julia Stiles gives her character a soulful depth and strength that few actresses could have possibly brought to this role. Finally, Martin Sheen is perfect as the coach of the basketball team who is constantly overlooking his son, Hugo, in favor of the bright star that is Odin. The update itself is stunning. As far as technical aspects, the cinematography really draws you in to the characters and their surroundings, as good films should. Also, the screenwriting made sense for today's audiences. The predicaments these kids are put in, sadly, wouldn't seem out of the ordinary in this day and age. No matter who you are, you can identify with being alienated by your parents, or perhaps wanting the girl you could never have, or trying your best and getting spit on instead.The outcomes and actions these kids take, however, are purely Shakespearean, which may not make it seem as realistic as you would want it to be. But this is a Shakespearean tragedy, which means that, of course, there will be no happy ending. Tim Blake Nelson and company had been given the daunting task to bring this story to a modern audience. Hats off to them for succeeding beautifully.

A secure identity is conferred by a heterosexual relationship. So, a lovely film with some moving moments and memorable scenes but ultimately a very conventional moral. Slightly disturbing perhaps that in the 21st century, Billy Elliott, the other great cinematic individual made good achieves his success in a career, albeit an unconventional one, whereas the female Amelie still has a man to make her whole. Not saying I didn't feel for her when he walked out (brilliantly portrayed by her turning into water) just that this film is not so radically different from anything Hollywood turns out as the emphasis on its Frenchness in the other comments might suggest.

No one knew that birds could be our arch enemies until Hitchcock. No one believed of a 25 foot White Shark prowling your coast until Spielberg. And no one knew how terrifying space could be until Ridley Scott and H.R. Giger showed us the Alien. One thing that makes this movie seem so real is the characters, who seem like you and me. For instance, the first conversation in the movie is a discussion over contracts and fair shares of money. Unlike Alien's many ripoffs, these aren't gung-ho space cowboys; they are normal people that just want to be paid and go home. This is what makes you care when they die. *Spoilers Ahead*       One ingenius thing I think Scott did with this movie is the body count. All but one character is killed off. Obviously, people are gonna die in a movie like this, but after awhile people start to think uh...wait a minute. That's a bit much, how many are left now? And when Ripley is left alone, you too, feel alone in the Nostromo, which makes it seem so scary. The alien design itself is amazing, and makes the movie work. You can't be that dramatic in showing the alien little by little unless you have an alien that is so unique that it is actually worth waiting till the end to see it. H.R. Giger has quite an imagination. The special effects, although maybe not as flashy as, say, Star Wars, are effective and amazing. Sigourney Weaver gives a very good performance as does the rest of the cast, more specifically Yaphett Koto and whoever played Ash. James Cameron's sequel Aliens most definitly equals this movie, and is surprisingly inventive for a sequel, but the original is the one that started it all. I highly reccomend seeing the entire trilogy (yes the trilogy) and leave Ressurection alone (I covered that more in my review of Ressurection).

He co-wrote and stars in this new SNL spin-off (though I haven't seen any of the sketches).  Compared to many of these SNL clunkers like Superstar and The Ladies' Man I found this comedy--though not hysterically funny--to be surprisingly refreshing.First of all, it's a harmless comedy.  Aside from a few crude sight gags--one involving a dog's testicles getting stuck to a porch and another involving Spade getting human crap poured all over him--I found the film to be quite disciplined and not over-the-top.  Though the gags aren't Woody Allen material, they don't strive to rise to the top of the Crude-O-Meter and there are a good deal of laughs.  That's what you get when you spend a little time conjuring up what would work best in a scene, rather than scribble out the first cheap, predictable gag that comes to mind.  I'm surprised at Spade (who co-wrote the script) and didn't think he would go through with injecting some wit into his comedy.  Maybe all these other SNL alumni who choose the write and star in another movie could learn from him. And I never thought I would one day say that someone can actually learn from David Spade.The cast is great, too.  Christopher Walken has a nice little supporting role as a school janitor.  I would tell you more about his character, but I don't want to give anything away.  The point is Walken's the man!  He's one of those actors who dominates the screen whenever he's on and you think to yourself, Yeah!  Now we're cooking!  The beautiful Brittany Daniel, who played Eve on Dawson's Creek, graces the screen and provides great eye candy.  And of course, the man himself--Kid Rock!--plays a small part.  I just wish Spade would've written his character as a musician.  I know that would be a poor excuse to have him perform one of his kick-a** songs, but who cares?!!  Dennis Miller is funny as always, playing the shock-jock who brought Joe to fame.  He plays a pretty significant role and appears in a good portion of the film, which is great since I'm a fan of Dennis' schtick.Joe Dirt is not a great movie.  At times it's lame, at times it's crude, but the key word is at times.  The film often delivers, and though you may not be laughing the whole way, you will have a good time without having to withstand a barrage of crudeness and stupidity.
