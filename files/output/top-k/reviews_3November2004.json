It will NOT save you a trip to the hospital.(spoilers) OK, let me tell you why the Texas Chainsaw sequels don't work. The original film is slightly exempt from this, but when you have someone who is screaming and wiggling so much that you wish she would just get killed so she'll shut the hell up, you have lost your ability to scare. Doesn't matter how good the sets or costumes or actors are, if the audience is holding their ears, you have a problem.The first sequel in the Texas Chainsaw series is meant to be nothing other than a bigger version of the original, this time fictionalized, and beefed up with the star power of Dennis Hopper. Not that the original was non-fiction. As you know, it was really based, very loosely, as it were, on the inhuman antics of Ed Gein in the 1950s, the same demented nutcase that inspired Psycho and The Silence of the Lambs. Sounds like a fun guy.Unfortunately, as is all too often the case with horror movies, this one comes off more as a sick comedy than a scary movie. Granted, there are horror movies that purposely come out like that, such as most of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, but the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a movie that caught people off guard because of its simplicity, its unknown cast, and its rough, documentary feel. In Texas Chainsaw 2, every single little bit of that is lost.The set, once we eventually get underground, looks like they rented the Indiana Jones set, festooned it with randomly placed naked light bulbs, furniture made out of human bones, and meat hooks, and had Leatherface run around swinging a chainsaw. The atmosphere of the movie has completely lost the claustrophobic feel of the original by vastly expanding the size of the set, much of which looks like a Christmas tree crossed with an esophagus, and there is just too much hooting and hollering for it to be scary. The only thing more irritating than the killers is their victim, 'Stretch.'The movie starts off with a couple of high school caricatures zooming down a desert highway, screaming at each other at the tops of their lungs about the sheer magnitude of the party that they are on their way to. They decide to swing into oncoming traffic to play chicken with someone driving a pickup truck, instantly making me eager to see them get killed. Doesn't matter that Leatherface is in that truck, anyone who plays chicken with a random driver because they're driving around drunk deserves to get killed. And if it takes place in a movie, they deserve to get killed with a chainsaw.So not only do we have to endure the hooting and hollering of these two jerks, but they call a radio station and we are asked to believe that this station's phones get completely tied up if someone calling in refuses to hang up. Sure, this is rural Texas and 1986, but are we to believe that even out there and back then, there were radio stations with a single phone line and without the ability to cut off the callers? At one point the clueless tech guy is frantically pushing buttons and pulling levers, trying to figure out how to clear the line. Given something so stupid, however, you know it was there for a reason, so that they could record the phone call as the kids get chainsawed on the other end. Speaking of which, the same kid that swerved into oncoming traffic at full speed finds himself stopped on a bridge as that same pickup truck sits blocking both lanes, and he frantically screams 'Are you crazy?!?' out the windshield while his idiot friend in the passenger seat offers such heroic tips as 'Just keep driving!' and 'Get outta here!' Good thinking'! Speaking of driving, not only can they not outrun a pickup truck traveling in reverse while supposedly holding the pedal to the floor in their Mercedes, but in the shots that show Leatherface standing and swinging his chainsaw, they are literally traveling all of 5mph.Dennis Hopper plays the uncle of the kids who were killed in the original movie, sort of a rogue detective out of his jurisdiction and showing up at the scene of the two kids' murder. The police refuse to jump to conclusions, but Lefty (Hopper) is sure that it's the same people who killed his nieces and nephews. Hopper makes a GREAT redneck. I generally am truly disappointed when actors take on fake accents, but Hopper does this one so well that you would swear he's lived in the south his entire life, it's just too bad that he's saddled with this idiot character.At one point, Stretch, the radio station DJ, shows up at his apartment, which, needless to say, is flooded with drunken rednecks wandering the halls with their arms around each other, and tells him that she has an audiotape of the murder because the kids called in just before they were attacked, and he sends her away! What the hell is that? Later he has a change of heart, but only wants to hear it if she'll play it on the air. The logic of the characters' actions in this movie is not starting off on the right foot. Then later, as Stretch hangs in a pit about to fall into the demons' lair, you might say, he tries to save her with a brittle, dried out arm bone. Clever.There is a lengthy horror scene inside the radio station, which looks like it doesn't know if it's supposed to be a radio station or a horror movie set, so better just be a little bit of both. It's got its vast storage of records stored safely behind an open door, with a heavy steel door guarding the cleaning supplies. A burglar's dream, you might say. We get a scene where Leatherface is assigned to kill Stretch, but when he finally gets through that steel door, he starts chainsawing a tub of soda cans sitting in ice, which have no reason for being there or for being chainsawed, until finally Stretch screams, 'Are you mad at me??' and my eyes glaze over for the remainder of the film.There's an effective scene where Leatherface puts Stretch's friend's freshly removed face over hers, supposedly to help her escape, but for the most part the underground portion of the film is a tired rehash of the original. Sure, it's bigger, there are more Christmas lights and more chainsaws, but essentially it's exactly the same thing, just without the surprise. They even replay exactly the same dinner scene from the end of the last movie, the most unpleasant scene in the entire movie. Lefty decides that he is so intent on delivering swift poetic justice that, rather than stock up on as many guns as he can carry, he buys three huge chainsaws and straps them to his body, and then runs screaming into the house, yelling and cutting down wooden supports as the family tortures Stretch. In Commando Arnold bulldozes into a weapons store and loads up on boatloads of guns and knives and explosives. In The Terminator he does the same thing, with the added bonus of killing off the proprietor before leaving. Lefty could have paid homage to both of those films, establishing Lefty as a good guy since he actually paid for his. But why saws and not guns? The grandparents, as is to be expected, are a hideous, hideous spectacle. Grandpa's 137 years old and still likes to hammer young girls on the head, and grandma spends her time in a wheelchair upstairs with a chainsaw on her lap. We are treated to a finale atop a huge rock outcropping that is so fake that it almost turns the movie into a comedy all by itself. There is at least one or two shots where the underlying chicken wire is nakedly visible.We get some sort of variation on the ending of the original, since the conclusion is almost a mirror image, in that the girl becomes the chainsaw wielding maniac rather than looking at him out the back window of a passing motorist, but I'm not sure what line of discussion led to the conclusion that this would be a cool way to end the film. Is this supposed to be the setup for a sequel? The family's dead, but now there's this girl who has caught chainsaw fever and will now carry on the legacy?

In Europe every region probably has its own legends and it is nice to see one of them appear in a movie.

As these hunters get closer to it, they find out the truth behind this beast that prays on innocent children and women...The cinematography is really breath taking, the actors did an excellent job and most of the time the fight scenes are nice to watch and yet the movie didn't blow me away. Everything was fine until I saw the Beast. Why did the director have to make it the way it looked?

I know many of you, especially the English speaking people, prefer this version, because they are not used to subtitles and they don't speak French. Still I think it is better to see the original movie. It just feels more natural, which I certainly prefer.What I liked about this movie was the story. In Europe every region probably has its own legends and it is nice to see one of them appear in a movie. Le pacte des loups or The Brotherhood of the Wolf tells the story, which is partially based on true events, of the Beast of Gevaudin that lived and killed in the mountains of Southern France in 1764, and of the people who were sent to hunt it down. As these hunters get closer to it, they find out the truth behind this beast that prays on innocent children and women...The cinematography is really breath taking, the actors did an excellent job and most of the time the fight scenes are nice to watch and yet the movie didn't blow me away. Everything was fine until I saw the Beast. Why did the director have to make it the way it looked? (no, I'm not going to tell you how it looks, you'll have to find it out for yourself) Why did he show it in the first place? I mean, wouldn't the suspense have been a lot bigger if he kept us waiting to see a glimpse of it?

I was eight, the year she is in the prolouge. Ever since, I have been interested in the story of Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanov, her life, and her untimely death.While I know the movie is not historically accurate, I don't care! The movie is fiction after all- based on a true story (of Anastasia's rumored escape and women who claimed to be her), loosely, mind you- but perhaps it is not as unlikely as it seems when the remains of the Romanovs were discovered back in 1991, Alexei (her brother,the Czarvitch) and one of the Grand Duchesses were missing. And with age analysis of the bones, scientists believe that the missing daughter is in fact Anastasia, and not one of her sisters, Olga, Tatiana, or Maria. But who really knows what happened?My opinion of the movie is that it is wonderful. It draws you into the world of the lost Russian Princess, to a time that is far away, long ago, that doesn't exist anymore.The music and animation are stunning, and the photo research of St. Petersburg is amazing! Take the Catherine Palace and the magnificent gate you see, as well as the city itself. The 3-D animation is amazing; you look like you could reach out and touch it! The music is truly magical; Once Upon a December (especially Deana Carter's version)is haunting yet beautiful. I own the soundtrack- I listen to it frequentlyto help me relax.But what I love best about the movie is the romance that occurs between Anya(Anastasia) and Dimitri. It starts out as a con, a trick for money, and turns into a love story. I think it shows that people really do have good in them, and that true love really exists. It's also heartwarming to think that a young boy who saved the girl he liked (princess or not) later helps her restore her identity and find a true place (in this case, happily together with him).Anastasia is really my favourite movie of all time, even though now I'm almost 15.

The subtitles allowing them to get away with things that no Hollywood films would allow at the time.(However don't think I am blindly championing it - it produced just as much dross as Hollywood.)Goddard is not actually my favourite French New Wave director because he is too self-indulgent, but he has a lot of courage and he is his own man. If something intrigues him, he holds it in frame until his curiosity is spent. For him the thing is personal and if you say you don't like it his answer would be well go and make your own film then.The problem with some people reviewing this film is that they seem to believe that because there are tricks for foreshortening scenes they should have been employed.

Back in the US, Ted's sister, Janet, (Mauriel Hemingway) a lawyer, is under pressure to move away or to pay her back taxes. Relishing a chance to get to know her brother, she invites him to stay at her house until he has a chance to get back on his feet. Her son, Brett, (Mason Gamble) and his dog Thor know that something is strange about him, and follows him into the woods and sees him, as a werewolf, ripping a man to shreds. Several more murders follow the next few nights, leaving the police baffled. Gradually beginning to suspect that the dog might be right, Janet and her son decide to let Thor and the werewolf fight for the land they both consider home.The Good News I think this has to be one of the creepiest looking werewolves ever filmed. The design seems like a cross between The Howling and An American Werewolf in London, with the best parts of each one replacing the weakness of the other one. Finally, a werewolf that is both threatening and physically imposing. I like this design better than many other werewolf movies, as it looks wolf-ish, but has a small hint of humanity in it. This is a big part of the film's success, and it does look convincing like a werewolf as well. This is due to the fact that the werewolf is a mechanical creature and not a CGI monster. It is much more realistic because the werewolf is in the shot and is not merely moving about in sync to the recorded footage. How much it allows filmmakers to make their favorite dreams come true, I despise it because of its apparent fake-ness. In a movie like this, we need to know that the monster is real and not fake, which this film does capture by using a real werewolf instead of the CGI werewolf. The gore is also in top quality. Here get several bloody attacks and kills. The first kill, where the girlfriend is killed, is a standout, not only opening with a bang but also we have a very violent thrashing and ripping. Even the final showdown is a bloody feast, with both participants doing major damage on each other, slashing each other and bloodletting all over the bodies. It is quite a finale indeed; gore hounds are not to be disappointed. The attacks are quite brutal and are very messy. It is hard to pick which one is the best, as it looks like time was taken to carefully prepare and plan the attacks. Add a few chilly suspense scenes and it has all the markings of a modern werewolf classic.The Bad News The movie is so short! It isn't even an hour and a half long. It's barely an hour and twenty minutes. It did have the potential to be over the hour and a half mark, but it missed somewhere and shortened the film. Too bad, because it did have the potential to be much longer. A few more killings and some suspense scenes showing the chase to hunt down the werewolf would've been very beneficial to the film, as they would've helped the film not only get longer but would've provided an extra scene or three that would've sold the movie.The Final Verdict While not necessarily breaking new ground, it does have enough entertaining scenes and a cool-looking werewolf to make this at least a rental viewing. Do see an uncensored version, like HBO or Starz, as that version would be better than the cut versions on regular channels. Werewolf fans would be hard pressed to find a modern watchable werewolf film, other than the Ginger Snaps series.Rated R Graphic Violence, Adult Language, violent attacks on animals, Nudity, and a sex scene.

Relishing a chance to get to know her brother, she invites him to stay at her house until he has a chance to get back on his feet. Her son, Brett, (Mason Gamble) and his dog Thor know that something is strange about him, and follows him into the woods and sees him, as a werewolf, ripping a man to shreds. Several more murders follow the next few nights, leaving the police baffled. Gradually beginning to suspect that the dog might be right, Janet and her son decide to let Thor and the werewolf fight for the land they both consider home.The Good News I think this has to be one of the creepiest looking werewolves ever filmed. The design seems like a cross between The Howling and An American Werewolf in London, with the best parts of each one replacing the weakness of the other one. Finally, a werewolf that is both threatening and physically imposing. I like this design better than many other werewolf movies, as it looks wolf-ish, but has a small hint of humanity in it. This is a big part of the film's success, and it does look convincing like a werewolf as well. This is due to the fact that the werewolf is a mechanical creature and not a CGI monster. It is much more realistic because the werewolf is in the shot and is not merely moving about in sync to the recorded footage. How much it allows filmmakers to make their favorite dreams come true, I despise it because of its apparent fake-ness. In a movie like this, we need to know that the monster is real and not fake, which this film does capture by using a real werewolf instead of the CGI werewolf. The gore is also in top quality. Here get several bloody attacks and kills. The first kill, where the girlfriend is killed, is a standout, not only opening with a bang but also we have a very violent thrashing and ripping. Even the final showdown is a bloody feast, with both participants doing major damage on each other, slashing each other and bloodletting all over the bodies. It is quite a finale indeed; gore hounds are not to be disappointed. The attacks are quite brutal and are very messy. It is hard to pick which one is the best, as it looks like time was taken to carefully prepare and plan the attacks. Add a few chilly suspense scenes and it has all the markings of a modern werewolf classic.The Bad News The movie is so short! It isn't even an hour and a half long. It's barely an hour and twenty minutes. It did have the potential to be over the hour and a half mark, but it missed somewhere and shortened the film. Too bad, because it did have the potential to be much longer. A few more killings and some suspense scenes showing the chase to hunt down the werewolf would've been very beneficial to the film, as they would've helped the film not only get longer but would've provided an extra scene or three that would've sold the movie.The Final Verdict While not necessarily breaking new ground, it does have enough entertaining scenes and a cool-looking werewolf to make this at least a rental viewing. Do see an uncensored version, like HBO or Starz, as that version would be better than the cut versions on regular channels. Werewolf fans would be hard pressed to find a modern watchable werewolf film, other than the Ginger Snaps series.Rated R Graphic Violence, Adult Language, violent attacks on animals, Nudity, and a sex scene.

In this disastrous sequel to the vastly superior Predator, we are left to wonder whether someone actually, in good conscience, thought it would be a clever idea to move the Predator into downtown LA, or whether it just took place closer to the movie studio because no one in their right mind would bankroll a film like this, so they couldn't afford any location shoots. My money's on the latter. And another thing, Predator 2 is set in the distant future (far off 1997!!), why would they do something like that? The movie came out in 1990 and then there was only seven years before we saw that downtown LA (specifically the criminals) do not look anything like they are portrayed in the movie. Look at Back to the Future II, for example. It was made almost 20 years ago, and there is still more than a decade before we will all see how wrong they were in predicting what the future would look like. At least the rest of the movie was good.The streets of LA look a lot like they did in the Robocop movies, and the criminals look like they did in Robocop 3, by leaps and bounds the worst of the series. We get all these criminals who are dressed up like circus clowns, and the movie even throws in some crime kingpins that look like caricatures of witch doctors and whatnot. Like they were flown in straight from the mountains of Nepal and asked to say a few lines for the camera. Is this supposed to create the sense of isolation and unfamiliarity that the first movie created so well? Please.Danny Glover takes on the role of Lieutenant Mike Harrigan, basically the leader on the search for the killer who keeps leaving bodies stripped naked, often with things like heads and spinal cords pulled out (not cut, but pulled) and hanging upside down, until the FBI, I think, shows up to take over the investigation. The endlessly watch-able Gary Busey steals the spotlight in every single one of his scenes, but mostly because Glover, also a massively talented actor, for some reason gives a halting and simply bad delivery of his horribly written lines. Busey's character is also pretty badly written, but he has such a recognizable presence that you almost don't notice. Ironically enough, it works to Busey's and the movie's advantage that he simply plays the same character that he almost always plays in his movies &#150; himself. The script is so full of clichés and unrealistic conversation that it sounds like it was written in an afternoon, if that. Had the writers read these lines out loud to themselves while writing it, I assure you they would have realized how ludicrous it sounded.The movie starts with a ludicrous shootout scene between the cops and entire herds of criminals, as the two gangs, you might say, fight for control of the streets. In the pessimistic future view of the movie, much like the Robocop films, crime is out of control, and as you see here, the police are out-manned and outgunned by the drug gangs on the streets. The Predator watches over this whole shootout, always out of sight, no doubt wondering why these creatures are so intent on killing off their own kind.Here's another interesting irony of the movie, the Predator, as is to be expected, comes with all kinds of new weapons, a remodeled mask, and lots of cool gadgetry, some of it meant for self-applied medical treatment, and yet some of the things that are brought over from the original film are just botched. We learn in this movie that the Predator doesn't make himself invisible, but is somehow able to bend light. That's even more impressive than invisibility! It almost gives you the perception that the Predator carries at least some of the power of something like a black hole, but the shimmer effect is just badly done here. I would have thought that a newer movie would have been able to improve upon the one from a few years earlier.Bill Paxton, 4 years after his performance as the over-the-top and entirely too cocky Private Hudson from Aliens, turns in a performance in this movie as exactly the same guy. Overly confident despite being in completely over his head. His role here, as he explains in his interview on the DVD, is to act entirely too sure of himself, like Billy the Kid, until he realizes what he's up against, at which point he turns into the whining baby that he was in Aliens.The only thing that the movie successfully brings over from the previous film is brought over as an excuse to allow a lot more guys to get killed and to make an excuse for the weakness of this movie's plot. The original team killed off by the Predator in South America was a top secret elite team of special forces, as Peter Keyes (Busey) explains to the clueless Harrigan (Glover), which is why the police forces involved have no idea what's going on. This allows for plenty of deaths before the FBI can convince the insubordinate police force (Harrigan, as it were) to believe them that the drug gangs are not involved here, and that they really do need to back off. Seriously, guys. Let us handle this. It's top secret. Harrigan, come on, back off. You don't know what you're dealing with. You don't have the resources or the knowledge to fight this enemy. I know that your friend was killed, but you just have to let us handle this. We know how to get this guy. Come on, Harrigan. I can't tell you what it really is, just let us handle it. OK fine, you see, there was this elite team in South America&#133;The best scene is the hunt scene about three quarters of the way through movie, and it's not good that this is the best scene because it is monumentally stupid. They come up with this great plan to have a room flooded with ultra-violet light while all the men wear these heat-proof spacesuits so the Predator can't see them and on top of that, they put this special dust in the air that will adhere to the Predator's body and make him visible. Great plan, except for the massive flashlights that everyone wears on their shoulders. This is the FBI! I learned in 7th grade that almost without exception, there is NO LIGHT WITHOUT HEAT. Did the FBI not realize that these flashlights were going to generate heat? My GOD.The Predator is just as ugly as in the original, but the mask has been reduced to a cheap Halloween mask, almost as bad as the Green Goblin's mask from Spider-Man. He's got this cool boomerang weapon that seemingly can cut through anything that it comes into contact with, but he talks in this movie. I hate that. Here's this alien, and he learns English just enough to deliver a couple of one-liners at exactly the right moments. At the time of this writing I have yet to see Alien vs. Predator, but I can only hope that they don't talk to each other in it. Leave the talking to Freddy!(spoilers) The grand finale of the movie starts off with a massive hole in both the script and basic logic. Harrigan finds himself hanging from the cables beneath an elevator as it descends, and he's screaming at the people inside it to stop the elevator so it doesn't crush him. Forget the fact that elevators stop a good 6-10 feet above the ground at the bottom of their shafts, this one not only has a rough hole at the bottom, but when Harrigan lets go of the cable, he falls through it and into a massive open area. The scene could ALMOST be saved if it were the basement, but it turns out to be the Predator's cavernous lair. Right there in the basement of some building in downtown LA. And no one ever noticed. We get this lengthy fight scene between Harrigan and the Predator, after which a whole crowd of Predators shows up (why they didn't come out to help their friend is not explained or wondered about), so Harrigan accepts defeat, but it turns out that they only wanted to come collect their dead and give Harrigan a gun from the early 18th Century, raspily muttering, 'Take it.' What the hell is this??Predator 2 is such a bad film that the Predator is the hero rather than the villain. He is the center of attention and we are watching to see these clueless morons get killed by him rather than to see them use their tactical expertise to do away with this unknown enemy, as was the case in the original film. Director Stephen Hopkins has turned the movie away from the action\/sci fi of the original and into a horror movie. It's just too bad he couldn't do the same with the comedy that he worked on before this movie, A Nightmare on Elm Street 5.The movie ends with a hint at a Part 3 (with the line 'They'll get their chance.') and I can only hope that AVP is that movie, because the last thing we need is more of this!

","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"3 November 2004","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" As a high school student, I grew enamored with the cult of Jack Nicholson. To me, he encapsulated everything I wanted to be aloof, rebellious, and, above all, wicked cool. Of course, I was basing my perception of him on the roles he played on screen - not the best judge of a man, as he was 'acting.' Nevertheless, the idea of Jack appealed to me, even if it was mythic.In any event, he represents the first actor over whom I became obsessed. I've seen, I think, all of his movies from Easy Rider on and have watched a handful of those old B-movies (The Terror, some random westerns) in which he appeared as well. Though my older self often finds his performances grating (sometime in the early 80s he decided to play each role the same way), I still find his work in the 1970s fantastic - among the greatest work by any American actor.The apogee of his acting career, for me, has always been his portrayal of Jake Gittes in Chinatown. Yes, he's astounding in Easy Rider (in comparison to Peter Fonda's wooden performance it'd be difficult to appear otherwise), Five Easy Pieces, the Last Detail, Cuckoo's Nest, King of Marvin Gardens, Prizzi's Honor, and About Schmidt (his best performance since Prizzi's), but as J.J. he truly amazes.He provides his detective the one thing Bogie never gave Marlowe or Spade - a softness. Yes, Jake Gittes is for the most part a sexist, violent, egotistical man (as all detective have been since the Black Mask started printing Hammett's stories), but there is a Romantic under-current to his character that hits the audience from the title screen onward.Jake Gittes' machismo, unlike that of Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe (the filmed version - Chandler's Marlowe has more depth and is ), is a put-on - a cover that helps him ignore his pain, his emotions. Spade was a reprehensible womanizer and terrible friend. Marlowe wasn't much better. Neither of them, though, had a reason. Gittes does and Nicholson does a tremendous job showing the audience that below the masculine sheen something troubles Jake. He compensates for the pain of what happened in Chinatown by slapping Evelyn around and by taking on her father.The look upon Nicholson's face in the famous 'sister\/daughter' scene is priceless. As he slaps Ms. Mulwray, he grimaces and we see that Jake hates what he is doing - he loves Evelyn, can't bear to hurt her, but feels he must in order to conform to stereotypical gender behavior and hide away his pain. Jake Gittes is the most conflicted and tortured private eye in film history and, I think, only Nicholson could give that performance.The other performances are equally memorable. Faye Dunaway is fantastic as Evelyn Mulwray, managing to make her sympathetic without allowing Mulwray to be cloying. John Huston, as her father, though, amazes nearly as much as Nicholson. In the film, Huston somehow manages to create one of the most terrifying villains of all time. His Noah Cross seems perfectly civilized on the surface but Huston gives Cross an edge. When he discusses eating fish with the heads still attached you cannot help but cringe; there's simply something so evil and slimy about him as he hunches over and eats the fish. We never see him act evil, but, through Huston's performance, we know.However, wonderful performances never create a great movie; they are only part of a great movie. Chinatown contains every component that makes a great film. The script never misses a beat, paying homage to and updating the detective movie (not necessarily the film noir, though, but that's another story). It also creates a perfectly realized and fascinating world through its cinematography and set design. Watching Chinatown, the audience feels as if they are in 1930s Los Angeles and can taste the dusty streets and feel the grimy heat on its neck. Moreover, Polanski's direction infuses the film with a certain European, existential dread that only an Eastern European could concoct.Chinatown would not be so fantastic, so perfect had another director helmed the project. No one else could have made a movie that is as paranoid and as pessimistic about our place in the world as Polanski did. It makes me happy that he made one great movie before being run out of town as a pedophile.*Spoilers* I probably stand alone in the belief that Chinatown is the greatest movie ever made, but I do not stand alone in saying this film is absolutely brilliant. Some may find the sour ending too glum, but think for a moment - would a happy ending ever have worked? Doesn't the movie's tragic mode require Gittes to endure yet another Chinatown? I believe it does and therefore must ignore complaints about the movie's ending; it could not end any other way.

To me, he encapsulated everything I wanted to be aloof, rebellious, and, above all, wicked cool. Of course, I was basing my perception of him on the roles he played on screen - not the best judge of a man, as he was 'acting.' Nevertheless, the idea of Jack appealed to me, even if it was mythic.In any event, he represents the first actor over whom I became obsessed. I've seen, I think, all of his movies from Easy Rider on and have watched a handful of those old B-movies (The Terror, some random westerns) in which he appeared as well. Though my older self often finds his performances grating (sometime in the early 80s he decided to play each role the same way), I still find his work in the 1970s fantastic - among the greatest work by any American actor.The apogee of his acting career, for me, has always been his portrayal of Jake Gittes in Chinatown. Yes, he's astounding in Easy Rider (in comparison to Peter Fonda's wooden performance it'd be difficult to appear otherwise), Five Easy Pieces, the Last Detail, Cuckoo's Nest, King of Marvin Gardens, Prizzi's Honor, and About Schmidt (his best performance since Prizzi's), but as J.J. he truly amazes.He provides his detective the one thing Bogie never gave Marlowe or Spade - a softness. Yes, Jake Gittes is for the most part a sexist, violent, egotistical man (as all detective have been since the Black Mask started printing Hammett's stories), but there is a Romantic under-current to his character that hits the audience from the title screen onward.Jake Gittes' machismo, unlike that of Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe (the filmed version - Chandler's Marlowe has more depth and is ), is a put-on - a cover that helps him ignore his pain, his emotions. Spade was a reprehensible womanizer and terrible friend. Marlowe wasn't much better. Neither of them, though, had a reason. Gittes does and Nicholson does a tremendous job showing the audience that below the masculine sheen something troubles Jake. He compensates for the pain of what happened in Chinatown by slapping Evelyn around and by taking on her father.The look upon Nicholson's face in the famous 'sister\/daughter' scene is priceless.

Forget how corny it seems that the setbacks keep occurring one after another. Forget the mistakes with the actual physics of space - Fire in space?

After watching Dawn and Day of the Dead and all the wonderful gore effects by the master, Tom Savini, I didn't think a film could make me cringe. Granted, Fulci's effects were no where near as well executed as Tom Savini's, most of the original concepts behind the death scenes more than made up for it. It's kind of a sad state that I can write about how I admire Fulci for keeping the camera on the blood and guts. When taboo subjects come up, he doesn't cut away. I am so sick of the sanitized mainstream Hollywood studio horror flick with no shocks, no scares, no tension, test-audience friendly, happy ending horror movie.It's an even sadder statement since gore-galore horror really is not my preference, and, in fact, I actually looked down on it when I first took an interest in the dark side of cinema. I preferred slick artistic style (blood or no blood, as it long as it plays well). Now I still would recommend Argento's Suspiria over the Beyond; however, I no longer bash the celebrations of blood (however, Friday the 13th still sucks.) Fulci plays out his scenes to an off beat, which I can respect but again it's not really my cup of tea (blood, whatever). Nothing wrong with the different pace and flow; it just never really clicked with me and never achieved the intensity of the Exorcist, Halloween, or Suspiria. Anyway, being from the US, Italian style of horror is an interesting (not to mention superior) switch from the usually sanitized Hollywood productions, and even things like the lack of a consistent language and obvious dub plays into the charm factor.One thing that did irk me was the fact that our leading man couldn't figure out that shooting zombies in the head had more effect than shooting them in the chest. Okay, even if I had not seen Romero's infamous trilogy, when surrounded by thirty walking corpses that want to eat me I'd like to think I'd be pretty quick in finding a way to drop them.

It's kind of a sad state that I can write about how I admire Fulci for keeping the camera on the blood and guts. When taboo subjects come up, he doesn't cut away. I am so sick of the sanitized mainstream Hollywood studio horror flick with no shocks, no scares, no tension, test-audience friendly, happy ending horror movie.It's an even sadder statement since gore-galore horror really is not my preference, and, in fact, I actually looked down on it when I first took an interest in the dark side of cinema. I preferred slick artistic style (blood or no blood, as it long as it plays well). Now I still would recommend Argento's Suspiria over the Beyond; however, I no longer bash the celebrations of blood (however, Friday the 13th still sucks.) Fulci plays out his scenes to an off beat, which I can respect but again it's not really my cup of tea (blood, whatever). Nothing wrong with the different pace and flow; it just never really clicked with me and never achieved the intensity of the Exorcist, Halloween, or Suspiria.

Live, die, escape, or wind up with the short story's ending - I didn't care. Heck, I only tolerated these buffoons for the comedy aspect, but by the midpoint of the film that was tired and there's no way in hell I'm taking them seriously.Usually when a film is made from written material, I still find suspense in wondering how the filmmakers will execute the story. For Friedkin's version of the Exorcist, Scott's rendition of Black Hawk Down, and Coppola's take on the Godfather, sure I knew the ending going into it, but I still find myself leaning forward in my chair in anticipation of what came next. This also applies to every new viewing of these films that I've already seen. A film done correctly, never really loses that feeling. Sure, Bride of Frankenstein doesn't scare me, but I still find myself anxious to see the next moment of brilliance.

I respected it's depiction of both Japanese and American soldiers as equals fighting an exhaustible war. Both sides reluctantly killing each other in contrast to many scenes shown in Vietnam movies where napalm is dropped enthusiastically by embittered troops. James Caviezel throughout the film in his voice overs question the reason of war and the loss of innocence. I have heard nothing as captivating as how he delivers these questions as the shots linger over nature and flashbacks for you.'Maybe all men got one big soul everybody's a part of, all faces are the same man.'After all Caviezel's character name is Private Witt if that doesn't suggest anything. He although has never lost his own innocence and with this he is utterly lost throughout the journey. A 'Linus' so to speak among so many instruments of death. Flashbacks of home are the only thing that proceed to fuel the soldier's in going forward. Sean Penn's character Sgt. Welsh contrasts that of Caviezel's character Private Witt as Satan to a Prophet. Welsh has lost his hope maybe even cast out of heaven just to have tea with a prophet more hopeful and infinitely wiser than he will ever be. On top of that Penn has a father like presence and role to Witt. Which is double irony. To add even further the shots of the scenery are beautiful in such a violent attempt to gain control over a single hill. Furthermore no one is portrayed as the winner in this film just more dead added to the landscape.The silence of shots comes through as the director's security in knowing there can be multiple view, interpretations, thoughts and reflections.

It is provocative yet never surrenders to conventional war clichés and hammed patriotism in Saving Private Ryan.

It even made the top ten best films on a list that places the Lord of the Rings trilogy higher than, oh, just about anything.Is Casablanca that great? Briefly, yes it is. Is it my favorite film or would I ever describe it as the greatest movie ever made? That is unlikely, but I will concede that they may be right to anyone who wants to argue that point. If you tell me it's the greatest movie of all time, I will say, you might be right. If you tell me the Lord of the Rings trilogy is, I will challenge you to a duel a la Zell Miller.Truth be told, Casablanca is my third favorite movie and I believe it is one of the greatest motion pictures ever created. It is one of the few true works of art the Hollywood system ever created. Like most great movies, though, it always begs the question - what's so special? Well, for starters, Michael Curtiz had, perhaps, the greatest cast of characters ever. You have the greatest male movie-star of all time playing the lead; you have a truly gifted and beautiful female lead; you have three of the greatest character actors ever in Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Paul Henreid.Second, you have an epic story condensed into a two-hour run time. The story has everything - murder mystery, war time thriller, espionage tale, love story, etc. As Umberto Eco pointed out in an essay, Casablanca is a collage of story types and moods; it has something for everyone.Third, and most importantly, it has the greatest movie ending of all time. As Rick watches Illsa's plane taxi down the Casablancan runway and he spouts that memorable line, you are shot through with a feeling that you have just been privy to something that is so perfect and right and you are amazed because, really, that ending would never make it to the final cut of a Hollywood film today. The bittersweetness of that ending is exactly what the narrative to that point calls for. Rick needs to stay; Illsa needs to go. Anything else would be trite and contrived.(As an aside, I was once at a bar having drinks with these two girls, one of whom I found incredibly attractive. I contemplated making a move with her and then the conversation turned to movies. She said, Casablanca is my favorite movie. It's soooo wonderful. I would just change the ending, though, so Rick and Illsa stay together. I gagged and discontinued any plans for romantic pursuits I had intended to embark upon with her.)
