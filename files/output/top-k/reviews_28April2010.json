However, I was quickly annoyed by the disgraceful attack on our Queen Elizabeth I. I can only assume the scriptwriter is descended from a disgruntled Scots emigrant and doesn't know the truth. Whilst the view of our great Queen as a brutal persecutor of Mary Queen of Scots may delight some disgruntled Scots, it is totally inaccurate. Mary was a foolish woman although also in a difficult situation as she was a staunch Catholic in a country that had turned mostly Protestant. After her third very stupid marriage failed and she was on the run from her own nobles who had no respect for her - which is significant - she hoped England would give her protection. Yet at the same time she continued to insist obsessively that she was Queen of England and plot and scheme to do away with her Protector Queen Elizabeth. Unfortunately for her, the usual rule of winner takes all applied. She had to be imprisoned as she was encouraging sedition. Elizabeth should have had her executed long before she actually did after enduring many years of Mary's interminable plotting against Elizabeth's life, but Elizabeth held to the view that a Monarch should not be dishonoured. It is a pity her cousin Mary of Scots didn't have the decency to honour Elizabeth similarly. Mary didn't it seems care about the fact that England had had an appalling experience under the brief but manic rule of Catholic fanatic Mary I who introduced the vicious Spanish Inquisition with horrendous results into England. Thank heaven she didn't last long. The Inquisition is totally alien to English ways. There was no way England would stand for another Catholic ruler either - which is partly why later James II later was slung out, and rightly. There is no way Fanny - or Jane Austen - would insult Queen Elizabeth as in this movie. I must assume the movie isn't British or the scriptwriter would know better.The Slave Trade... Jane Austen did not get into politics. Fanny wouldn't have dared to criticise. Tom is a selfish arrogant drunkard and I don't remember him ever complaining about slavery. Did he? Fanny was quiet and careful not to offend and very well aware of her lowly status. Her Aunt Sir Thomas's wife was very fond of Fanny though imposed greatly on her - why isn't this bond shown? Fanny and Edmund were rather insufferable prigs by our modern standards but not by theirs. This movie's Fanny is far too feisty by far.If the scriptwriter hadn't chosen to get into politics and smear England's great Queen, this movie would have gained 8 stars from me. I don't mind a loose adaptation, but do get the facts right. If the story had been written by a Scot resentful of the treatment of their Catholic Queen Mary and about Scots of the time who might have been equally annoyed, the view of Mary and Elizabeth it expressed would have made sense.

It's stark and poetic, emotional but existential, it's about human nature, human life, human circumstance. The story is a simple and often told one, but then again, the stories of life tend to be simple and often told. The heart of the film lies in the very beginning where the two young lovers Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) stand in each other's arms and watch the cranes flying in the sky. They love each other. They don't know it yet, but they are about to be separated by war. This is the first and last moment of peace, harmony and love in their lives. The rest of their years are going to be filled with heartache, guilt, hardships, hunger, grief, death. The film ends on a hopeful and even joyous note. You have to see it to believe it.This is the first point. Very simple. It's a wonderful film that you should see. Then there are the historical notes, and the technical qualities to marvel about. Based on a play by Viktor Rozov, who wrote the screenplay, the film was directed by Mikhail Kalatozov who was one of the first Soviet filmmakers to emerge and blossom after Stalin's death (he was his former head of production). He would make tremors with his 1964 pro-Castro documentary I Am Cuba, but The Cranes Are Flying won him the Palme D'Or in 1957. It's no wonder either, not only does the film prove amazing craftsmanship but it would also remind anyone of a more general European art film from the same time (the French New Wave easily comes into mind). At the same time, it seems to have managed to pass all of the demands from the Soviet Union. It doesn't come off as a patriotic spectacle of propaganda but, as I said, it does end hopefully, with the love for the people shining from within the people itself.Tatyana Samojlova is the heroine of the film, and Kalatozov is occupied following her with the greatest of care. Much of the film is portrayed in silence, but it's not the kind of artistic silent quality you might expect. It's a quiet film, the absence of sound is naturalistic, as are the cranes in the sky and the feelings of Veronika as her childish romance dies out while she grows older in the war times. She loves Boris, lost in field. She marries a man she doesn't love. The film suggests feelings of guilt and shame. We're not sure, Samojlova is too human. There are breathtaking moments of film making in this film that, made in 1956, seems to predate most original methods of film making - and, I'd say, to this day it's not often you see sequences like the one where she is desperate, running along a train seemingly at the same speed, whilst the film itself seems to react at the sudden impact of speed and emotion. It's like the entire film looses control over itself, she almost outruns it herself, and you can't say what will happen the very next second or, once that second has passed, the second after that.This is a film about human beings, the value of human life, of love and family and hope. But it's not entirely an anti-war film, as one might suppose. This is a film where the characters face their sadness and their emotional tragedies right up front and never tries to deny them or shun from them, or in any way prolong their suffering. There is a higher cause and life must be lived by the citizens of an entire country in hope, because if we loose hope the suffering will have been pointless.

The editing tricks in this film are also mind blowing. The scene when he jumps on the raft, then it cuts to Hoffman jumping in bed with Mrs. Robinson, then back to him when you hear his dad voice. That was just one of the few examples of fantastic editing. The acting was also great in this film. Have only seen Hoffman before in his role as Rain man, I was already a fan but his performance in this may rival his performance in Rain man. Mrs. Robinson was just as good and I was even more surprise to see her daughter actually look like a younger version of her. The film was funny, dramatic, sad, shocking, and the list could go on and on. This film had a little bit of everything and thats is just part of the reason why it was so go. The film had a strong social message that at the time an entire generation could relate to, and the youth of today can still relate too. I related to it just because of the pressure I feel from my parents is very similar to what Hoffman was going through. Not only did this film reach out to youth, it show to parents that they need to be careful how much pressure they put on there kids.

But where Nicholson's Jack Torrance was an archetypal villain straight out of the silent era &#x96; a man who put the ego-maniac in the maniacal &#x96; Clayton's melodrama bellows straight out of the Governess, played by Deborah Kerr.

Such a theme has been touched before of course, and actually The Island of Dr. Moreau is the last film I'd recommend to get the message across. this b-grade sci-fi flick is occasionally interesting, and potentially freaky (in the sort of way that dark fairy tales are) but generally, its just reckless and dumbThe curtain rises with a sensational aerial shot of a life raft adrift on a soft blue sea. Three souls are on board, two kill each other in a fight and the third, Mr. Douglas (a UN representative) is left in nature's hands. He is picked up by a small ship and taken to a lush jungle island, where he finds out that the once famed Dr. Moreau has been hiding for seventeen years conducting bizarre experiments of a rather hairy nature. What could the old doctor possibly want with an ordinary guy like Douglas, and why is it becoming increasingly evident that the island ain't gonna let him go.The set-up is very good, but after about forty minutes, the scenario becomes kinda pointless, starting from when we meet the old Doctor. So this where Marlon Brando's career ended up in the last years of his life.

Val Kilmer and David Thewlis are equally lazy and sloppy in their performances. some of it also has to to with the atrocious dialog they have been given.I'll gives props to Stan Winston and his make-up department for the weird and wonderful beasts on this crazy island. If anything they are a step up from those goofy apes in Congo, (made the precious year). Here, there is a variety of forms and styles, almost as many as there were dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. The creatures themselves are rather emotionally confused it seems, but they all share the wish to be human, like 'the father'. Well, the film favors them in one manner. They get to deliver dialogue as equally cheesy as that of the few humans on the island. It might have been nice if the story got us to care a little more for these guys. There may have been some thematic values there too, a chance to explain how one cannot be judged by its looks. Perhaps the film's intention is to do the opposite, and get us to see them as what they look like; savage beasts. It's really not something worth dwelling on.The Island of Dr. Moreau is a little over ninety minutes, which is about the average length for these sort of movies, but it feels surprisingly short. Among many other things, it is definitely in need of a couple more scenes which focus on character rather than chaos, or motif rather than monstrosity. I think I'm being somewhat generous to The Island of Dr. Moreau.

In using a plot item as routine as said example and applying it to a relatively routine singular strand arc for the film's narrative to take, Leone essentially breathes so much life into a set up and plot plan that about half way through you forget the basic bare bones of the movie and find yourself going with it, utterly immersed in the tale the director's laying out in front of you. So much has been written and said about the film, like other such examples at the top of each genre, that further comment and analysis may seem futile. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly may very well be the pinnacle to the western as Psycho might be to horror or Apocalypse Now to the war, for instance. If it isn't, or either of the said examples aren't, then there will still be a large cluster of individuals that would sternly argue otherwise.The film begins with a loud and confrontational title sequence, a brash and expansive manner in which to announce your film has arrived; the sort that sees a flashing of character faces and arrays of different colour, a sequence in which even the little animated horse gets the full force of a cannonball that's been fired off. It sets the tone for a no holds barred ride of guns; gunslingers and no nonsense people with no nonsense attitudes as observations of greed and that of both a mid and post-war crumbling society plays out. The film features some of the best direction I've ever seen; Leone's ability to shift gears and change the film's tact from one thing to another, as loyalties shift and events take a turn for the different is near-flawless. His ability to essentially construct a number of small, minute set-pieces amidst this wide-open and dusty, hostile setting is immaculate; but the change of tact he applies later on towards the end of the film in capturing a Civil War battle between the North and South is just as impressive; portraying a larger fight sequence as the inevitable showdown between the film's three main players draws nearer and that sense their showdown will be of a similarly epic proportion, despite it being just another gunfight and despite the fact all of those thus far have been between grossly outmatched participants.Leone is all for spectacle and action to propel the plot, but his ability to capture the little things; the terrain and just the sounds that it omits is wonderful. The introduction of Angel Eyes, aka The Bad (van Cleef), for instance sees a young boy flee into his house on first sight of him as he arrives; Angel Eyes' boots stomping on a stone floor whilst he approaches an elderly man sitting at a table as a dog barks outside, all of it a routine use of composition and SFX, but the drawn out editing process; the fact a kid ran for his life at first sight of him and the semiotical driven noise of a barking dog which suggests a rabid animal or ominousness build the scene and character without anyone ever explaining or saying anything.They call him The Bad because he shoots without mercy and takes without conscience, leaving a family in tatters and on another occasion beats a girl to a near pulp until she gives him what info he's looking for. The name Angel Eyes is wholly ironic. This makes Clint Eastwood's 'Good' (aka Blondie) and Wallach's 'Ugly' (aka Tuco) perhaps look more favourable than they actually are when it's revealed they're mostly in it together against this blackly dressed; father\/husband murdering; woman slapping figure of evil. Tuco and Blondie's relationship is a strange one, a mutual appreciation of one another and the death they leave in their wake. Tuco would no sooner shoot Blondie, than hang him, than act like they're best friends. No longer is 'The Good' of a western limited to wearing the sheriff's badge and\/or cleaning up towns of drunks and no-good varmints; as here, 'The Good' would much rather come across as upstanding; fleece a local sheriff of $2,000 and then make off with the cash against the guy he was initially in tow with.Tuco's raging attitudes are captured in a single shot that encompasses a sketching of Christ on the cross as he swigs alcohol whilst wearing an eye-patch, the film at a point where Tuco seems to be doing good in aiding an old friend but perhaps with a traitorous eye still on the prize as the patch acts as a visual distinction of the two sides of his face doubling up as his sinful and righteous attitudes, whereas he gives the Holy Trinity throughout. But THE scene that encapsulates his character is in a store early on during which, betrayed and foaming at the mouth for revenge, he fondles some handguns in front of an elderly clerk before angrily discarding them. He then fondles some more and asks for bullets, drawing you into the scene in an utterly effective manner and its threat element within as we wonder what he has in store for the clerk above all else. There's a solid hour of character involvement and some set-piece exchanges which work wonderfully well; and a later juxtaposition between diegetic musical content with an interrogation brought a smirk to my face when I realised whom it was that felt so inspired to pay homage to such a sequence.

No longer is 'The Good' of a western limited to wearing the sheriff's badge and\/or cleaning up towns of drunks and no-good varmints; as here, 'The Good' would much rather come across as upstanding; fleece a local sheriff of $2,000 and then make off with the cash against the guy he was initially in tow with.Tuco's raging attitudes are captured in a single shot that encompasses a sketching of Christ on the cross as he swigs alcohol whilst wearing an eye-patch, the film at a point where Tuco seems to be doing good in aiding an old friend but perhaps with a traitorous eye still on the prize as the patch acts as a visual distinction of the two sides of his face doubling up as his sinful and righteous attitudes, whereas he gives the Holy Trinity throughout. But THE scene that encapsulates his character is in a store early on during which, betrayed and foaming at the mouth for revenge, he fondles some handguns in front of an elderly clerk before angrily discarding them. He then fondles some more and asks for bullets, drawing you into the scene in an utterly effective manner and its threat element within as we wonder what he has in store for the clerk above all else. There's a solid hour of character involvement and some set-piece exchanges which work wonderfully well; and a later juxtaposition between diegetic musical content with an interrogation brought a smirk to my face when I realised whom it was that felt so inspired to pay homage to such a sequence. The film is engrossing, rich in detail on so many levels and an absolute outright winner of a piece.

Also, in real life Allenby considered Lawrence one of his dearest friends. What I said about Lawrence is the same for Tayi. When this movie was released, his descendants filed a lawsuit against Columbia pictures saying their father had been misrepresented. It went on for about 10 years before the lawsuit was dropped. Also, Gasim was one of four characters created for the picture. The scene where Lawrence shots him after he confesses to killing someone was put in to stir Anti-War Sentiments at the time.

At the time I found the former a pleasant contrast with the latter, which seemed to consist mainly of the U.S.S. Enterprise drifting through green murk. 'The Black Hole', on the other hand, was lively and unpretentious.Research vessel 'Palamino', commanded by Captain Dan Holland ( Robert Forster ) encounters a ship called 'Cygnus' which went missing twenty years before during a project to study black holes. As they approach, the seemingly dead ship comes to life. In command of an android army is the brilliant if deranged Professor Hans Rheinhardt ( Maximillian Schell ), who is obsessed with the black hole and plans on venturing into it. He claims the others left years ago. Dr.Kate McCrae ( Yvette Mimieaux ) learns that her father ( one of the Cygnus team ) is dead. As Rheinhardt plays charming host, one of Holland's party notices a robot funeral taking place. The crew never left the Cygnus. Rheinhardt had them converted into androids... This is basically '20,000 Leagues Under The Sea' meets 'Star Wars', with Schell's 'Rheinhardt' replacing James Mason's 'Nemo'. The robot Maximillian is intended to be the film's 'Darth Vader'. I read Alan Dean Foster's novelisation before seeing the movie, and it occurred to me that this had the potential to be a lot more adult in tone. Alas, the film played it safe by falling back on stock Disney clichés - the headstrong young man ( Joseph Bottoms ), the coward ( Ernest Borgnine ), and the square-jawed hero ( Forster ). Accompanying them is Anthony Perkins as 'Dr.Alex Durand', who sides with the villain until he gets accidentally shredded by Maximillian. There's also a robot - V.I.N.C.E.N.T. - who looks like the illegitimate son of 'C3PO' and 'R2D2' from 'Star Wars'. It was voiced by ( an uncredited ) Roddy McDowall. The robot is used mainly for comic relief, and like 'Bubo' in 'Clash Of The Titans', spoils every scene he\/it is in. Worse, we also get 'Old B.O.B.', a robot who sounds like an ageing cowboy ( voiced by Slim Pickens ). The special effects are good overall, with lots of nice laser gun battles with robots, but the highlight has to be the shot of our heroes running along a bridge with a giant meteor rolling towards them. Scientifically preposterous, but who cares? John Barry wrote the music, meaning that at any time you expect Roger Moore's 'James Bond' to appear.

This is basically '20,000 Leagues Under The Sea' meets 'Star Wars', with Schell's 'Rheinhardt' replacing James Mason's 'Nemo'. The robot Maximillian is intended to be the film's 'Darth Vader'. I read Alan Dean Foster's novelisation before seeing the movie, and it occurred to me that this had the potential to be a lot more adult in tone. Alas, the film played it safe by falling back on stock Disney clichés - the headstrong young man ( Joseph Bottoms ), the coward ( Ernest Borgnine ), and the square-jawed hero ( Forster ). Accompanying them is Anthony Perkins as 'Dr.Alex Durand', who sides with the villain until he gets accidentally shredded by Maximillian. There's also a robot - V.I.N.C.E.N.T. - who looks like the illegitimate son of 'C3PO' and 'R2D2' from 'Star Wars'. It was voiced by ( an uncredited ) Roddy McDowall. The robot is used mainly for comic relief, and like 'Bubo' in 'Clash Of The Titans', spoils every scene he\/it is in. Worse, we also get 'Old B.O.B.', a robot who sounds like an ageing cowboy ( voiced by Slim Pickens ). The special effects are good overall, with lots of nice laser gun battles with robots, but the highlight has to be the shot of our heroes running along a bridge with a giant meteor rolling towards them. Scientifically preposterous, but who cares? John Barry wrote the music, meaning that at any time you expect Roger Moore's 'James Bond' to appear. The climax has the Palomino crew entering the black hole and suddenly the film switches to '2001' mode. Though a sequel - 'Beyond The Black Hole' - was mooted at the time, it did not happen. Disney went back to doing what it was best at.

Pay no attention to the DVD cover which makes it sound like some sort of thriller action spy mystery. That couldn't be further from the truth (and it's probably why there are so many disappointed critics).No, in true Wenders style, this is a very deep, philosophically charged work of art. But what sets it apart from Wenders' other masterpieces (Wings of Desire, Paris Texas, etc) is the humour. All the characters in this movie are certifiably insane. Mel Gibson plays an uptight FBI agent who literally looks like he has a pole up his posterior in every shot. Despite his punctilious nature and impeccable shoes, he is clearly the most insane of the lot, and we watch with joy as he slowly devolves into a total nutcase like the rest. Jeremy Davies is brilliant as the retard--more or less a kind of Shakespearian fool who knows the secret to everything but is too busy being an idiot to tell anyone. Milla is another looneybird in a role she was made for. And then we have a host of minor characters who are so funny they steal the show.My review probably makes it sound like a madcap Mel Brooks extravaganza but not quite. The key is deadpan. The whole film is so straight-faced deadpan that 90% of the audience won't get the jokes. When I saw it, I was the only person choking with laughter while everyone else thought I had lost my mind and\/or swallowed a hairball. That's the kind of movie this is.If you enjoy the humour of Jim Jarmusch (Coffee and Cigarettes, Night on Earth) or Vincent Gallo (Buffalo 66, Arizona Dream) or even the biting satires of Paul Verhoeven (Robocop, Starship Troopers), I think you'll love this movie. There's so much wit and commentary, but it's so subtle you need to pay close attention.The other stuff beautiful cinematography, great acting, wonderful story, etc. Of course that's in there, as with all Wenders films. But as far as I know, this is the first time Wenders has tipped into full deadpan comedy. I think it was a smashing success. But what do I know? As the film implies, there's a fine line between 'art' and 'tar' (you'll understand if you watch it).

As much as I tried, I simply could not get into this movie. I know it's hailed as a great indie film and has a cult following, but I didn't enjoy it.The plot revolves around a mathematician named Max. Max is convinced that everything in nature is governed by math and, therefore, predictable. He takes this theory and does considerable research into the stock market, trying to see if he can predict it. On some level, he succeeds and attracts some people who wish to exploit this knowledge for personal gain (one is a businesswoman of some sort looking to use this information for money, the other is a group of Jews trying to find answers about God). To add to his troubles, Max suffers from recurring, very intense headaches.I wish I could say I know all this from my actual viewing, but I can't. The fact is, this movie is so confusing it's very hard to tell what's going on at any given point. This doesn't sink the film for me, though. I've sat through and enjoyed many films that were very confusing. What sinks this film for me is the visual style. The movie is shot in black and white due to the lack of funding and whatnot. This gives the film a very gritty look. On top of that is the soundtrack, which is very unpleasant (especially during his headache sequences because of a loud, high pitched screech that plays). All of this coupled with the disturbing and paranoid nature of the script makes for a very uncomfortable experience. For some, this may work, but not for me. These two factors (confusing script and irritating audio\/visual style) led me to hate this film roughly 20 minutes into it. One another thing to mention is that many of the low light situations look horrible and add to the confusion.I relate watching this movie to having someone read me a story while someone else continually slaps me in the face.
