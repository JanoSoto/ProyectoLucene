Thank you very much, guys from the BBC, for once more programming this purely genius cinema-milestone that still hasn't lost any of its power to impress, thrill or even sadden. King Kong is over 70 years old now, but still an astonishing experience with groundbreaking visual effects and innovating ways of scripting that would influence the future of cinema a great deal. The story opens somewhat banal, with Robert Armstrong as the shifty showman recruiting a bunch of macho seamen and one stunningly beautiful actress to sail out for a supposedly big project. The island where they arrive is very secluded and homed by a primitive tribe and prehistoric animals. But the most notable inhabitant is a humongous and bad-tempered gorilla that seems to rule over anything on the island. Expedition leader Denham hopes to benumb the animal and take it back to New York to exhibit, and that even seems possible since King Kong's romantic interest in the actress makes him vulnerable. King Kong is more than just a magnificent piece of animation techniques&#133;He's portrayed as a fully-fledged character that you're meant to care (or even cheer) for. He's not exactly a cute little monkey but nevertheless he has honest emotions and protects what he loves. Simply because of this unique character development, however, King Kong becomes a hugely moving story and the classic finale is downright saddening, in my opinion. Who cares if he kills so many people&#133;the ape has feelings! Nothing but great respect for O'Brien immortal stop-motion animation work and also Max Steiner's subtly atmospheric music contributes in making King Kong one of the absolute greatest movies ever. The extended battle-sequences between the giant ape and multiple types of dinosaurs definitely still rank amongst the most perplexing images in horror\/adventure cinema ever. Also, and especially with all the additional footage of re-releases, this is a rather cruel film with a tremendous body count and some very efficient shock moments. Perfect piece of nostalgic cinema from every way you look at it.

The 1976 remake features a man in an ape suit. The jerky, stop-motion ape is better.You first realise that the 1976 Kong is a complete stinker when the giant ape kidnaps Jessica Lange. Up until then the film is mildly diverting. Yeah, Jeff Bridges seems to be an expert on everything under the sun (apes, medicine, ancient tribes, photography etc.) and yeah Lange runs about like a mentally handicapped child in Daisy Dukes (who would have ever thought that she'd turn out to be such a fantastic actress?), but it's well shot, its got a magnificent John Barry score and updating the film so that the greedy capitalist is in the oil business rather than show business is a nice touch. But then Lange is sacrificed to Kong by the tribe and everything is flushed down the toilet.The appearance of Kong himself isn't that bad (even though the way it was filmed made me think of the marshmallow man in Ghostbusters), but once Lange is in his grip and they start 'communicating', the film becomes risible. She even calls him a chauvinist pig ape! Right on, sister! Or maybe not&#133; But then she begins hitting his rubber face. And to make matters worse, she then begins apologising It's a sign of insecurity, like when you knock down trees. What? And just when it couldn't get any worse, she starts rubbing his hand and calling him a nice sweet monkey. Oh, and she starts talking about astrology. No wonder he bends down and lets her go. Who'd want to date a woman like that? But unfortunately Kong is enamoured; he doesn't respond too well when Lange tries to run off. But the way he stops her is quite amusing. Rick Baker in a monkey suit runs through some rubber trees and then a rubbish robotic monkey hand toys with Lange so she can't get away. It really is quite funny how crap the hands are. They move very slowly and the fingers move even slower, meaning they sort of resemble large fly swats. They have no dexterity so they can only usher Lange about. And the hands are so bad that when they pick Lange up she has to almost position herself into them.The hands are also amusing when they strip Lange &#150; Kong wants to see the goods. This big clumsy finger that can only move up or down rips her top off. But what does Kong hope to accomplish? Surely they can't mate. But if I know my monkeys (and a well known online encyclopedia corroborates this), then male gorillas only have one-inch penises. So if Kong is five or six times the size of a normal ape, then, well, monkey love might well be possible.Jeff Bridges, who himself resembles an ape with a big beard and Chewbacca hair, certainly seems to agree with me. There is a girl out there who may be running for her life from some gigantic turned-on ape. And later on there's a great bit when Charles Grodin, the capitalist who doesn't strike oil but decides to make money out of Kong instead, says, It's not someone, it's an animal. A beast that tried to rape you. In Kong's defence, he was given her by a large tribe. As far as he's concerned, anything that might have happened was entirely legit.But if the 'romance' between Kong and Lange is bad, the action is even worse. One of the worst moments has to be when Kong fights a giant snake. It seems even more immobile than his robot hands. Seriously, Baker in his suit just has to roll about for a while with an inanimate snake before ripping its face off. The matching scene in the original is much better. In the original, Kong grabs the snake by the tail and hammers it over and over again into the rocky surface.I also don't like the way that this Kong is less homicidal. In both films there's a scene where Kong grabs a giant log and tosses men off of it to their bloody deaths. But while in the original he just seems to do it out of spite, here they shoot first. That's nowhere near as much fun.And the Kong show here isn't as good. In the original the crazy filmmaker fleeces lots of rich people of their money, raises a curtain and there's Kong (it makes me laugh because that seems to be the whole show &#150; you sit there for a couple of hours and look at a chained up ape). But here he emerges from a giant oil pump! Obviously it's meant to be satirical, and yeah its funny the way they make Lange re-enact being sacrificed by the tribe, but its like Kong has gone downmarket. Once he trod the boards, now he's a cog in a marketing campaign. What a sad fate.But the show's bad for another reason. All throughout the film, in long shots, Kong is a man in a monkey suit, but for some inexplicable reason, in this scene, there are one or two shots of a full-scale robot. It moves even worse than the robot hands; it moves like a less agile version of Frankenstein's monster.And the ending is quite amusing in how it's supposed to be tragic. Kong, carrying Lange, gets chased by soldiers with flamethrowers and leaps across the World Trade Centre towers with strings on his back. Then he lets go of his beloved, gets shot by helicopters and falls off the side to the floor where, as he's dying, he shares a last meaningful look with Lange (who has somehow got to the bottom in record time).

From what the DVD box said, it seemed like a great idea for a movie--the troubles a fat girl goes through when she has an older, very attractive sister who seemingly has it all. However, that was not the message I took from the movie. It was more along the lines of life stinks--then you get raped or die. Oh I hated this movie and I have contempt for those who created it.So why did I hate it other that the fact that the theme really was not what I had expected? First, the movie is VERY sexually graphic and the nudity portrayed involved girls who appeared between the ages of 12 and 15 or so. Because of this, I doubt it would even be legal to make this film in many countries--especially when the 12 year-old is raped on film! I am truly worried that a pedophile might become very aroused watching the movie.Second, the exact purpose and theme of the movie is completely ambiguous. Every time I thought the movie was trying to make a point, the plot completely changed directions and the meaning was obscured. I know for those in the know, the point of such films IS the pointlessness. Okay, fine, I get it....but so what?!Third, the ending was sick and meaningless and seemed 100% random. COMPLETELY out of the blue, the mother and older daughter are brutally murdered on camera while they are resting in their car at a rest stop (the older daughter having her head bashed in with a hatchet and the mother was strangled). THEN, the 12 year-old is graphically raped on camera as well. It was like watching a snuff film and I cannot recommend this film to anyone.It was even more disturbing when I read the notes inside the Criterion DVD case. Apparently the young girl who played the Fat Girl (Anaïs Reboux) was not told that was going to be the international title for the film (in France it was titled À ma soeur!). That, combined with the rape scene--I'd hate to have to pay that girl's therapy bills when she gets older!The only reason the film gets a 2 was because the film was TECHNICALLY well-made. While a technically horrible film like PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE or THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN are clearly scored a 1 on the IMDb, I would MUCH rather view them. Although these two films are a mess and the acting is poor, at least they weren't patently offensive or exploitative or make me feel dirty for having watched them. Do NOT watch this film and do not believe any of the positive hype you've heard about the movie.

First, the movie is VERY sexually graphic and the nudity portrayed involved girls who appeared between the ages of 12 and 15 or so. Because of this, I doubt it would even be legal to make this film in many countries--especially when the 12 year-old is raped on film! I am truly worried that a pedophile might become very aroused watching the movie.Second, the exact purpose and theme of the movie is completely ambiguous. Every time I thought the movie was trying to make a point, the plot completely changed directions and the meaning was obscured. I know for those in the know, the point of such films IS the pointlessness. Okay, fine, I get it....but so what?!Third, the ending was sick and meaningless and seemed 100% random. COMPLETELY out of the blue, the mother and older daughter are brutally murdered on camera while they are resting in their car at a rest stop (the older daughter having her head bashed in with a hatchet and the mother was strangled). THEN, the 12 year-old is graphically raped on camera as well. It was like watching a snuff film and I cannot recommend this film to anyone.It was even more disturbing when I read the notes inside the Criterion DVD case. Apparently the young girl who played the Fat Girl (Anaïs Reboux) was not told that was going to be the international title for the film (in France it was titled À ma soeur!). That, combined with the rape scene--I'd hate to have to pay that girl's therapy bills when she gets older!The only reason the film gets a 2 was because the film was TECHNICALLY well-made. While a technically horrible film like PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE or THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN are clearly scored a 1 on the IMDb, I would MUCH rather view them. Although these two films are a mess and the acting is poor, at least they weren't patently offensive or exploitative or make me feel dirty for having watched them.

This landmark of independent film-making is a true jewel that should be the text book for every aspiring filmmaker, as well as a movie that every horror fan must have in their collection.The plot is amazing in simplicity, a couple of siblings visit the grave of their father when suddenly, a man attacks them and kills the older brother.

The movie is like the direct heir of Hitchcock's The Birds, where a similar device is used to gather the characters and explore them.Besides the similitude with The Birds, Romero goes boldly to new levels, trading the Hitchcocknian suspense for visceral horror, giving us the basis for gore in horror movies. The movie is very violent for its time, and sets the tone for the 70s explosion of horror movies.The acting is surprisingly good, considering that the actors had few or none acting experience. Duane Jones as Ben, gives a larger than life performance, and it is amazing the job he does with the role.The ending is still powerful and its social cometary (something that Romero always tries to put in his movies, with mixed results), is still valid today.Overall a classic, Romero would create his masterpiece a few years later with Dawn of the Dead, my only complain is that it seems that he'll never top those achievements again. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 December 2005","score":"","review":" To speak of George Romero's debut is to speak of one of the most influential movies in the horror genre.

Yet, let's contextualise it, for technical aspects of the film were superb, the use of set design was phenomenal for one. To recreate on an epic scale the junks of China, the bullrings of Spain and to pat down even the costumes of the 19th Century Colonial era took great effort. Sure the film was considered big budget material with a $6 million budget but hey, they had to pay for Frank Sinatra, Buster Keaton, a made-up Shirley Maclaine (spray tans didn't even exist then...) and all the celebrity cameos didn't they! Also, even though I was watching a poor quality transfer version (not quite the 1992 Disney re-transfer so hyped about), I found myself gripped by the way in which the script stayed relatively true to the concept of Phileas Fogg (the pedantic timekeeper in true colonial gentleman form), Passpertout (of whom Cantinflas the actor really stole the scenes in this film) and really brought some engaging scenes and panoramic views (not literally for me of course) unseen in film at the time. The film also serves as quite the time machine-like portal for me now that I've watched it in 2005, where just analysing how films were made and structured (the naievete of it all, etc) in 1956 is as intriguing as watching the content itself. Truly, its main flaw is that it watches as much like a modern day travelogue, simply glossing over the intrinsic sense of adventure and threat or thrills even in the most parts, that really glued the Verne original. There was the sense that the storyline could have better been adapted to screenplay such as in the scene where they rescued the Indian Princess.

This pounding, pulsating action flick is full of plot holes and implausible action set pieces, but has terrific energy and a handful of engaging performances which make its flaws forgivable. It is a film that will never win any awards for subtlety, but it is effective in doing what it sets out to do - that being to fill two hours of screen time with spectacle and entertainment. Bay is a director whose work I generally tend to dislike but with The Rock he has, for once, done a good job (aided in no small part by the excitingly silly premise and the game performances of Connery, Cage and Harris).Disgruntled American war hero General Francis X. Hummel (Ed Harris) and a team of heavily armed mercenaries seize the San Francisco island-prison of Alcatraz. They imprison a group of tourists and set up a series of missiles at various points around the island. Each missile contains a lethal chemical which, when released or exploded, has the capacity to kill hundreds of thousands of people in the vicinity. A team of soldiers is assembled to get onto the Rock, led by Commander Anderson (Michael Biehn). Also sent along for the purpose of disarming the missiles is inexperienced chemical weapons specialist Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage), a guy who would rather be cuddling up to his pregnant wife than tackling a bunch of impeccably-drilled renegade marines. The only problems is that none of them have any idea how to get onto Alcatraz undetected, so the Government agents have to reluctantly call upon the one man who can help them. Ex-SAS soldier John Mason (Sean Connery), who has been locked away 30 years for stealing a government microfilm and is the only man ever to have escaped from Alcatraz, is temporarily freed and instructed to guide the raiding party into the underground tunnels of The Rock. The raid goes awry and nearly all the would-be rescuers are captured and killed, leaving just Mason and Goodspeed to evade the bad guys, find and disarm the missiles, and save the city!!The Rock is very much a packaged, polished film. Nothing raw, edgy or unpredictable here. It's a film that plays safe and delivers the requisite thrills and spills in much the same way that a roller-coaster does. As usual the bad guys can't shoot straight, and the good guys can always think of a witty remark at the very moment they dispose of a villain. The action filmed in a dizzying, lightning-fast style with whizzing pans of the camera and furious cross-cutting of camera angles. This makes the action come across as fast-paced and exciting. Hans Zimmer's score is suitably frenetic and adds to the drama. As you would expect there are predictable scenes, moments that require total suspension of belief, chunks of corny macho dialogue, and every cliché in the book (including a wholly irrelevant car chase - but hey! What's a film set in San Francisco if it DOESN'T feature a car chase?!?) In spite of all this The Rock is a lot of fun and if you watch it for what it is, you'll find it an entertaining slice of escapism.

And there are few action films that have totally riveted me from start to finish like FACE\/OFF. This thoroughly original and truly exciting film is one the finest examples of this genre, mounted by proved action genius John Woo, who has become sort of the Sam Peckinpaugh of this generation. The movie centers a long standing cat-and-mouse game between a veteran FBI agent (John Travolta) and a demented career criminal (Nicolas Cage), who, many years ago, in an attempt to murder Travolta, murdered his son instead. Cage's Castor Troy has planted a bomb somewhere in Los Angeles and is then assumed to be dead. Travolta's Sean Archer can only learn where the bomb is from Castor's brother and the only way he can get the information from him is to become Castor Troy which involves a highly technical surgical procedure where Troy's face is removed from his comatose body and placed on Travolta's face. However, the story gets ugly when Castor awakens from his coma, has Travolta's face put on himself, and then murders everyone who knows about the plan. It's such an interesting story that the viewer can't help but become emotionally involved in and what a great acting challenge for these two actors, who, at times, must adapt each other's speech patterns and mannerisms in order to make this ruse work. Travolta and Cage do some of the best work of their respective careers here, almost to the point that you can forget who is who at what time. Joan Allen, one of the best actresses in the business, offers solid support, as Sean Archer's confused wife, caught in the middle of this deadly game and Gina Gershon makes a strong impression as Troy's girl and mother of his son, but this is Cage and Travolta's show all the way, and with the help of an intelligent screenplay and masterful direction, bring us one of the great action\/adventure epics of the last 20 years.

He hears of another submarine coming into Pearl Harbor with a wounded captain who will be on medical leave.

Though this is a submarine film, you can see plot elements of Flying Leathernecks and The Caine Mutiny here. Brad Dexter is in the Fred MacMurray role.If Humphrey Bogart on the Caine had had at least one confidant on board he might not have cracked up. Gable's confidante on the Nerka is Jack Warden who is desk bound with him and transferred with him to the Nerka when Gable got command. Both Warden and Dexter are the best in a good supporting cast. By the way what Gable is drilling his men in doing is shooting with precise speed and accuracy into the bow of an oncoming enemy ship and then diving for cover in split seconds. Quite a maneuver. And quite a good film as well.
