Basically a high-tech updating of the Pinnochio legend set in the future. A young couple whose son lies in a comatose state is allowed to road-test an android that resembles a young boy (played by Haley Joel Osment). The father seems oddly uninvolved in the project he initiated, but the mother (Frances O'Connor) blunders ahead and speaks the words that will allow the android to bond to her. Naturally, the couple's son regains consciousness and the android, who now has all of the personality and emotions of a real boy is no longer required. Rather than having him destroyed, the mother abandons him in the wilderness and the android embarks on a physical and psychological journey to become real so his mother will love him. The opening segments are cold and antiseptic, but intriguing and offer some of the most restrained directorial work that Spielberg has ever done. After the android's abandonment, the film starts to spin out of control. The meandering journey through the wilderness is pointless and starts to wear on the viewer. The addition of a companion in the form of an on-the-run hustler robot named Gigolo Joe (an oddly asexual Jude Law) fails to develop in any conceivable way. By the time the film seems to be staggering towards a climax, it has yet a third jarring tone shift that allows it to play past at least two logical conclusions into a third unendurable hour. The final segment\/conclusion comes out of no where and fails to successfully address or explore any of the deep issues that the opening act put forth. The final result is an initially promising film that is ultimately unfocused,dramatically uneven in tone and in desperate need of major editing.

Instead, the wonder lies in watching Al Pacino (in his worst and only Oscar-winning performance) scream, sputter, gesticulate, cuss, yell Hooha after every other line, chew huge chunks out of the NYC scenery and basically provide an atrocious performance that contains no traces of subtlety or introspection for the entire running time. The actor responsible in giving us some of the best acting of the 70s in The Godfather films, Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico, etc., gets rewarded for his most execrable work? That's Hollywood for you!

In this future corporate society a new sport called rollerball takes the place of other team sports like football, soccer and basketball as well as of war. The whole aim of rollerball seems to be to control the population in the hopes that the players will eventually die. However, Johnathon E. seems to be a bit too good at this game, lasting 10 years in professional rollerball, longer than any other player ever. Therefore, the corporate executives fear him as someone who could lead to the demise of their entire system of society, and they want him to retire and when he refuses they change the rules in the hopes that he will die. Once again one of those evil sci-fi cinemas about futuristic totalitarianism that always gives me a somewhat scary feeling.The film is as I said basically a good movie, but it could have a little more clarity about the plot.

The rest of the film is essentially nifty visual effects that don't do much to enhance the plot.So when I saw the first half of Deep Impact, I was amazed. Apart from a brief montage of special effects in the opening sequence (a car crash that simply screams big budget), the movie is one of the first disaster movies I've seen that actually focuses more on the human side of the drama rather than the awesome visual effects that computers can accomplish.Many times during the film, especially during the latter half, I felt myself touched by the realism that the actors and actresses convey. There are moments when you realize how fragile and precious life is, and that's saying something for a film of this budget.While the visual effects are indeed impressive, there are other features that make Deep Impact a necessary film to watch. James Horner's music is strikingly similar to his previous Titanic and Apollo 13 scores, but it is still hauntingly beautiful and fits the tone of the movie perfectly. Tea Leoni does a good job of portraying a newscaster attempting to cover the events surrounding her while dealing with her own personal emotions, which is undoubtedly a hard act to pull off. Elijah Wood shows his skill years before Lord of the Rings hit theaters.

They're unable to find Jesse's car and basically go on a quest to find it. Which involves their twin girlfriends's trashed house, expensive gifts they don't' remember buying, such as cell phones, a car, and jumpsuits, a suitcase full of money that belongs to a transvestite stripper, and the need to find a device called the continum transfunctioner. Sounds ridiculous? Of course it does!! All stupid movies like this have ridiculous plots. But I think that's what makes it so entertaining. The jokes don't fall flat in this film and some of the events that the guys are involved in are so funny that it'll bring tears to your eyes. Seann William Scott and Ashton Kutcher were perfect for this film. They're comedic abilities were right on cue. Of course this movie won't go down in history as one of the greatest films ever made but it certainly is one of the funniest pieces of mindless entertainment. I love this film dearly and it makes me laugh every time. This movie isn't for everyone and those who aren't fans of stupid movies like this shouldn't watch it. You'll definitely have something negative to say about it if you're not a fan. But I love Dude, Where's My Car? and I'm glad I have it in my collection. This film is so funny!! Thank you for reading my review! ","genre":"Comedy, Mystery"},{"date":"13 March 2007","score":"","review":" Dude, Where's My Car? from 2000 is one of my very favorite movies. I love stupid movies like this anyway, OK, SOME of them, and this one was\/is an absolute treat. I love Seann William Scott and Ashton Kutcher and of course it's icing on the cake having those two in this film. This film is stupid, yes. But so funny!! This is one of the funniest stupid movies ever. I love it!! The plot basically focuses on two potheads, Jesse and Chester, played by Kutcher and Scott, who wake up one morning with no memory of the previous night's events.

From the director of Speed, Jan De Bont, it is a remake of the 1963 film, where a bunch of people are placed in the isolated house to study sleep disorders and problems, and obviously it turns out to be to find ghosts. Basically Eleanor 'Nell' Vance (Ransom's Lili Taylor) is called to meet with Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) and three other people at Hill House for a research stay. The people that look after the house, Mr. Dudley (Bruce Dern, Laura Dern's Dad) and Mrs. Dudley (Home Alone 3's Marian Seldes) say that no-one will be around and no-one can hear them, duh! These other three people, Theo (not renamed in SM2, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones), Luke Sanderson (Owen Wilson) and that one that gets her eye slashed, obviously settle better, but as more and more bizarre and spooky things happen in the house, mostly to Nell, she finds out the secrets behind the previous people of the house, including Hugh Crane, his wife and their children they never had. I really liked all the sequences that are memorably spoofed in SM2, e.g. the door knocker, the ghost crawling in the bed, Crane on the stairs, and if you have the SM2 DVD, the deleted scene with more than just eye slashing.

It is filmed in such an annoying way in between cartoon and film - how it has got average rating of 7.4 is beyond me. The story is about this boy who approaches random people, they then babble on about their perspective on different aspects of life, he doesn't even ask them a question and they have verbal diarrhea on him, poor kid. Not much thought has gone into this or slacker. Both movies annoy the heck outta me because they are too simple and random. Although i do appreciate the subject matter, it is delivered in a weird boring manner. Invent a storyline then put it together with the subject matter and then i'll watch it.
