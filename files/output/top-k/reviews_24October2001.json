However, Apocalypse Now Redux belongs in the lower portions of the rankings along with The Matrix and Twister.  Well, maybe not that bad, but it really upsets me to see a great film ruined.I'm normally the first person to defend a director's right to do with a film what he or she pleases.  But in this case, I feel that Coppola has, since going through the hell that was directing this film, become a completely different director who makes nothing but terrible movies like Jack and Godfather Part III.  Therefore, he shouldn't have been allowed to go anywhere near this film again.  This restriction would have been out of fear that he would do exactly what he did.  He reduced one of the greatest pieces of pure cinema into a summer blockbuster, action, buddy, popcorn movie.Think about the first time you ever saw Apocalypse Now.  Think about the sense of wonder that washed over you as you followed Willard down the river into the unknown.  Getting to the point where you knew you had to simply accept all the things that were happening around you was the point of the entire first two thirds of the film.  It was after that point, that you are brought to realize that you must do something.  You must try your hardest to affect the outside world that you seem to have cut yourself off from.  This was (and still is) a brilliant film.Now imagine if that huge flow of precious emotion that you were feeling the entire time was reduced to a feel good movie about a bunch of guys on a boat going to kill some one.  Imagine plenty of things blowing up real good.  Imagine Kilgore turning into a whiny freak who just wants his surfboard back.  Imagine Willard developing a sense of friendship with the rest of the guys on the boat.  Imagine a slapstick moment of gratuitous sex.  In your worst nightmare, you can not imagine how low Redux sunk compared to the original.The first major change that shows up is the assault on the village with Kilgore.  I have to admit that I thought it looked much better.  It seemed to be a little easier to get a hold of.  However, I didn't realize that the rest of the movie would be just that.  Apocalypse Now was a film that begged to be seen several times.  It was hard to follow, not because of poor writing or editing, but because that's the nature of war and becoming a killer.  Redux is as straightforward as movies get.  It's up there with the original theatrical release of Blade Runner.  Redux takes the stance of We need to spell everything out for people so they don't feel confused.  If some one watches a movie and hates it based solely on the fact that it's hard to follow at first, you shouldn't want them as an audience.It's time for people who enjoy films to start demanding good films.  Why do we have to reduce everything to the lowest common denominator in the audience.  Sure, we can let stupid people have their movies like Armageddon, Tomb Raider, and The Animal.  But don't turn a great film into dumbed down trite.  You always hear about studios retooling movies so as to make them more marketable.  I understand that studios have to make money, so let Julia Roberts and Adam Sandler churn out movies for stupid people and use those profits to make ten good films that you won't mess with.ps.

However, it is possible to use cliches in a good way. After all, they wouldn't be cliches if they hadn't worked before. Because there's really nothing new here, it's not a great film by any means, but it's not bad either. The plot is fairly generic. But even though you have a pretty good idea how it's going to end, it's still interesting to watch. Red Planet still has some genuinely suspenseful moments despite it's predictability.The characters are probably not as developed as they should be, but they are more developed than a standard summer action movie. There were a few times when characters were talking that I felt like the audience should have learned more from the scene that they did. That makes those scenes go by a little slowly. There is some character development that works a little better though. And when there is action, it's well done. Also, all of the actors do a pretty good job. Carrie-Anne Moss falters a bit near the end, but that's my only complaint about the acting.Technically speaking, Red Planet is extremely well done. The Martian landscapes are incredibly well done. I don't consider myself shallow, but even if everything else about the movie had been absolutely horrible, the effects would still have made it worthwhile.

I've never watched a movie which triggered a similar emotional response. The first half, or thereabouts, of Songcatcher was sublime, and the second half collapsed as it tried to parlee with every cheesy Hollywood stereotype ever filmed.I've no idea what goes on in a Hollywood studio, but to me, it seems like this film was directed by either two people, or just one person trying to (possibly having to)please too many people at once. The movie began brilliantly as the stiff yet passionate Doctor bugged out due to her secondary status as a woman in a patricarchal academic system. We are then tranplanted, a bit abruptly, to the backwoods American mountains filled with beauty, spirit and song. The passion of the Doctor to collect these songs in the name of science is a bit unerving, but at least it shows she has character. However, her resolve is softened by her surroundings. Beautiful surroundings where the sublime music(Emmylou Harris, Iris Dement, Taj Mahal and Emily Rossum)completely transcends the ugly backwood and hillbilly stereotypes. Which is what the movie, I thought, was all about.Yet, as soon as we are fed, in retrospect, the gratuitous helping of local color, the film lapses into a cheesy, melodramatic passion play, albeit with a few weak variations on a theme.

I was shocked that such subject matter could have me howling with laughter at one point and then turning me on my head and making me feel guilty. Now DITD did something else. Bjork's got something about her that makes you want to watch, I wasn't the biggest fan of her music but I thought her voice was amazing and distinct, so let's see if she can pull this off. The synopsis on the back of the video gave nothing away which was possibly why I felt like I'd been kicked in back of the head and had my stomach ripped out at the turning point of the film when it goes eerily wrong for the child like Selma. The idea of having the musical scenes interspersing the tradgedy and mundanity of Selma's life were executed in such a way that I, like Selma, never wanted them to end.  I didn't want to go back to her normal life, I wanted to be in the musical with her.  I found myself shouting at the screen, fearful of the next moment. There is one part in the film where I felt myself feeling helpless.  Bjork walks off down the railway track and Von Triers camera glances back at Deneuve and she clasps her mouth as if her whole body is about to cry and it hits you right in eyes and you can't help but be taken in by the story. Dancer In The Dark is one of those unsung masterpieces of cinema that you have to view with an open mind.  The concept sounds stupifying but it is pulled of in such a way that the final scene is filled with such raw power and emotion that it will leave you numb, cold and completely and utterly useless.  This film uses the viewer like nothing you have ever seen.  It spits you out used and helpless.

She wraps herself up so much in the role it is a pleasure to be in her company and Von Treirs camerawork, whilst not everyones thing, is what blurs the line between fantasy and reality.  All of the cynics and their steadicams should take heed of Von Triers style and committment to pursuing human truth.

I have seen it at least 20 times and cannot get sick of it. Guy Pearce rocks and kind of has a Brad Pitt quality about him in this movie. I really hope that movies like this become a standard. I am really getting tired of hearing people say that they really think Cast Away was a good movie or that titanic was even decent. movies like that make me sick, there is no thought put into them and a five year old could have written better dialogue. It's sad to know that those types of movies are 30 times more lucrative then works of art like memento are. Memento is the most original, well-written, well-directed,and well-acted movie i have ever seen. This is definitely my favorite movie of all time and i'm sure that after you see it you will feel exactly the same.

I have seen it at least 20 times and cannot get sick of it. Guy Pearce rocks and kind of has a Brad Pitt quality about him in this movie. I really hope that movies like this become a standard. I am really getting tired of hearing people say that they really think Cast Away was a good movie or that titanic was even decent. movies like that make me sick, there is no thought put into them and a five year old could have written better dialogue. It's sad to know that those types of movies are 30 times more lucrative then works of art like memento are.
