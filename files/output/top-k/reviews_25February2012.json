In my opinion this is one of the most powerful quotes ever uttered in a movie, and luckily for Fightclub, most of the other powerful quotes take their residence in the movie as well.  People are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden. And so starts the phenomenally acted, breath taking action movie Fight Club. Once you begin the movie you are on the edge of your seat taking in every shot, every line, every movement of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Fightclub inhabits your body, it becomes an addiction, a need. WIthout Fightclubs presence you feel empty. After watching Fightclub I felt empty, but most important I felt full. I had to watch the movie again to relieve the emptiness, and once it was over the second time I began to take the fullness and think. Fightclub is a movie that makes you think about what you've done with your life, about everything, and especially society and mediocrity. Be prepared to realize that, as Tyler Durden says, We are all part of the same compost heap. Firstly there is no actor that can ever compare to Edward Norton. Norton has a calm intensity that is riveting. Edward Nortons narration of the film made it at least ninety times better than any other movie I've ever seen. Listening to his voice is soothing and it adds a stage presence to anything he is speaking of. Edward Norton's character was like his other half, it felt natural, even Norton's body suggested his character traits. Without Edward Norton their would be no Fightclub. If anyone tells you that FightClub stars Brad Pitt, you can just look at them and inform them that they obviously haven't seen Fightclub. Brad Pitt, though not the star of FightClub, adds so much character to the movie through his role of Tyler Durden. Brad Pitt's laugh was one of the most intense and maniacal laughs I've ever heard in any movie, no matter what genre. Tyler Durden was a character that was vital to the film that if he had been cast wrong the movie wouldn't be half of what it is today, and it's IMDb's 14th Most Popular Movie Ever Made. Luckily for Brad PItt he has a tendency to be perfect at these types of films. We just had a near life experience, as Tyler would say.Helena Bonham Carter has a darkness about her, it's extremely eye catching and well-done, it's almost an art-form. She continues to amaze me through her depressed, but loving characters who have such a violent range of emotions that you can barely follow her, but you have fun trying too. I love Marla and her role in the movie. Meat Loaf, and Jared Leto add to the story through their humorous interpretations of what could be heart-breaking characters. Both perform amazingly and add relativity to the film in their own special-little ways.The story was written so perfectly that I couldn't find a single flaw in it. Every moment of the movie made me more attentive to the plot. The ending, and twists were constructed so effortlessly that you barely realized they were happening. Every moment, and every cut of the movie to a different moment in Tyler or The Narrartor's life added infinitely to the film. It was well made off of the novel and in the moments of deviation from Palahnuick's work it was only an addition to the watchability, or the possibilities of movies. It was a great shrine to the novel's excellence. David Fincher was fifty percent of what the film is. Every time the camera angle, or scene changes he adds something that surprises or informs the plot. Adding in the intricate detailed moments and flashes of image or sound controlled the movie's knowledge of anarchy, and Tyler. Fincher's shots made the movie first-rate, insightful, original, clever, and thought-provoking, not to mention kick-ass. Fightclub is power, and makes you think twice about life and society, definitely worth a watch no matter who you are, or what your beliefs are. Remember the first and second rules of Fightclub do not talk about Fightclub.

So, when I heard that Frank Marshall, the producer who worked with Steven Spielberg in the Indiana Jones films, directed this adaptation of the book, I thought it was a very cool idea and would catch my very interest, but going through with all the hatred it had, this film didn't hold up for me, but despite going over the Nostalgia Critic review of this film, however, I thought that this is an OK film. Not good, not bad. Just sort of There. A test of formal mediocrity. I'm surprised that Roger Ebert himself liked this film, but as for me, I'm calling this a guilty pleasure.There are a few good things that prevented me for giving this movie a much lower rating. The cinematography is surprisingly superb, the scenery is very nice to look at, and Jerry Goldsmith's music score was very riveting. The strongest aspect goes to the cast. Laura Linney did a good job as the strong lead. Dylan Walsh, although not his best performance, gives a good delivery. Tim Curry, however, was OK. His accent didn't interest me, but hey it's acting. What do you expect? In fact, I really liked him here despite the hammy material he's been given. So, please, critics. Stop criticizing the actor. I felt that Joe Don Baker was so annoying because he does nothing other than overreacting and shouting. The best actors in this movie so far goes to Bruce Campbell for his clever personality and Ernie Hudson for his flawless charm and grin. That's it for my praise.So, what do I hate about this movie? Well, there are four problems that didn't leave an impact. First, the Dialogue is easily mediocre. It had some crude material, but at least it had some funny moments (Stop eating my sesame cake). Second, the plot deviates itself from the book although it had a great atmosphere in some of the scenes. Third, the directing from Frank Marshall was very inconsistent. And fourth, but not the least, is the movie's cheesy special effects and I didn't get why the monkeys jump into the lava near the end of the film which was the most cheesiest moment. Even the scene in the King Solomons Mine scene was very graphic. I mean, getting your head bashed felt pretty real. Shocking, isn't it?Overall, Congo isn't as horrible as the critics generally said it was, but with a better plot and better special effects, it would have been an astounding film other than a mediocre adaptation of the book written by the same guy who wrote Jurassic Park.Rating 5.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 February 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I've read the book by Michael Crichton once and I actually found it a little graphic in it's violence, but that's what makes it so enjoyable to read.

First, it was hard for me to picture Sean Connery (who plays the male lead Mark Rutland) as anything other than James Bond this early in his career. He had just come off of doing the first 2 Bond films (Dr No in '62 and From Russia With Love in '63) and this came out the same year as Goldfinger (arguably the best Bond film ever!) and so he still had that James Bond look and it must have been hard for filmgoers to shake this. Also, I didn't expect Tippi Hedren (who plays the star and title character Marnie) to be as good as she actually is in this film, and she's very good! Marnie is surprisingly probably the most psychological and character-driven film that Hitchcock may have ever done! Now, I'm not necessarily saying this is his best film. It definitely is not IMHO, but best is subjective when it comes to film anyway, and I actually understand both sides of the coin when it comes to this film. While it's naysayers are right that has it's frustrating moments and flaws, it's most ardent defenders have an argument that it is a very intriguing, provocative piece of filmmaking, and probably marks the end of Hitchcock's genius period from the early 50s to the mid-60s. I'm really somewhere in the middle. While I actually like this film more so than I expected, there are still frustrating things about it.Hedren is very impressive in an extremely challenging role. She convincingly portrays a frigid woman who is totally content without male companionship (even more impressive because a year prior, she played a character much more expressive, forthcoming, and unapologetic about her sexual appetites and desires in The Birds). Hedren's attractiveness doesn't detract from her character's frigidity. In fact, it probably makes it all the more ironic because an attractive woman like her could get many men, if she wanted! Connery is also very good in another challenging role. Mark is a very complex and ambiguous character throughout the film, actually more complex than Marnie. Even after watching the film a few times, I think it's still debatable why Mark is doing all of this! He seems to have a rather unnatural obsession with Marnie, indicating that he may be even more screwed up than she is! Yet we still don't really KNOW why he is doing any of this at the end of it all.The standout of the supporting cast is Louise Latham (who plays Marnie's mother Mrs. Edgar). Latham only has two scenes that pretty much bookend the film and manages to steal the movie from the 2 stars! Convincingly sporting a Southern accent and aged with makeup to look older, Latham makes the most out of a key role. One of the more memorable minor characters in Hitchcock's films! I think the strongest parts of Marnie are the beginning and ending. The first 30 minutes of Marnie really draws the viewer in as the film starts off with a great opening scene of the aftermath of one of Marnie's crimes and then a sly introduction of her character and the early scene with her mother. Then the frustrating part kicks in as the film slows down to a snail's pace around the 30-minute mark as Mark and Marnie engage in a battle of wits and pyschobabble on and off for about an hour, which starts to get redundant.

First, it was hard for me to picture Sean Connery (who plays the male lead Mark Rutland) as anything other than James Bond this early in his career. He had just come off of doing the first 2 Bond films (Dr No in '62 and From Russia With Love in '63) and this came out the same year as Goldfinger (arguably the best Bond film ever!) and so he still had that James Bond look and it must have been hard for filmgoers to shake this. Also, I didn't expect Tippi Hedren (who plays the star and title character Marnie) to be as good as she actually is in this film, and she's very good! Marnie is surprisingly probably the most psychological and character-driven film that Hitchcock may have ever done! Now, I'm not necessarily saying this is his best film. It definitely is not IMHO, but best is subjective when it comes to film anyway, and I actually understand both sides of the coin when it comes to this film. While it's naysayers are right that has it's frustrating moments and flaws, it's most ardent defenders have an argument that it is a very intriguing, provocative piece of filmmaking, and probably marks the end of Hitchcock's genius period from the early 50s to the mid-60s. I'm really somewhere in the middle. While I actually like this film more so than I expected, there are still frustrating things about it.Hedren is very impressive in an extremely challenging role. She convincingly portrays a frigid woman who is totally content without male companionship (even more impressive because a year prior, she played a character much more expressive, forthcoming, and unapologetic about her sexual appetites and desires in The Birds). Hedren's attractiveness doesn't detract from her character's frigidity. In fact, it probably makes it all the more ironic because an attractive woman like her could get many men, if she wanted! Connery is also very good in another challenging role. Mark is a very complex and ambiguous character throughout the film, actually more complex than Marnie. Even after watching the film a few times, I think it's still debatable why Mark is doing all of this! He seems to have a rather unnatural obsession with Marnie, indicating that he may be even more screwed up than she is! Yet we still don't really KNOW why he is doing any of this at the end of it all.The standout of the supporting cast is Louise Latham (who plays Marnie's mother Mrs. Edgar). Latham only has two scenes that pretty much bookend the film and manages to steal the movie from the 2 stars! Convincingly sporting a Southern accent and aged with makeup to look older, Latham makes the most out of a key role. One of the more memorable minor characters in Hitchcock's films! I think the strongest parts of Marnie are the beginning and ending. The first 30 minutes of Marnie really draws the viewer in as the film starts off with a great opening scene of the aftermath of one of Marnie's crimes and then a sly introduction of her character and the early scene with her mother. Then the frustrating part kicks in as the film slows down to a snail's pace around the 30-minute mark as Mark and Marnie engage in a battle of wits and pyschobabble on and off for about an hour, which starts to get redundant.

Ted shows us how innocuous evil can be, and presents it with such flair and elegance we can imagine such a man being in a rural town like that, hiding his crimes beneath a veil of anonymity and isolation. Rated R for violence, language, gore, and some partial nudity, this is definitely not a film for the kids or even the young teens, if you ever want them to trust your neighbors and you live in a small town.

It was atrocious, every bit as bad as I expected and even gave Ballistic Ecks vs Sever a run for its money. Discussing the film with the Work Geek, I said that the only way I would see a worse film this year was unless I was deliberately trying to see a worse film. Sadly, truer words have never been spoken because although I knew this was bad, I was unprepared for how utterly soul-destroying this film actually is.This time George Clooney is duped into playing Bruce Wayne, millionaire playboy and secret identity of Batman whose previously singular existence as Gotham City's crime-fighter-in-chief is under threat as he's now working alongside Robin (Chris O'Donnell) full-time. And he needs to when crazed scientist Mr Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) begins waging his icy war against the citizens of Gotham. But when Freeze is joined by the seductive Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), the Dynamic Duo struggle to hold things together. But even at Wayne Mayor, things take a turn for the tragic (in every sense) when butler Alfred (Michael Gough) is visited by his niece Barbara (Alicia Silverstone) as his own health begins to fail...There is honestly not a single thing I can find praise for in the internationally renowned turkey Batman & Robin. I suppose that the set design must have taken a certain amount of effort in the planning stage but on screen, everything just looks muddled and garish. And I guess that Uma Thurman looks hot in some scenes but enough of my celebrity crushes. The story is garbage and bears almost no relation to the source material - this is more based around the Sixties TV show than anything in the comics, animated TV shows or the three previous movies. Take Bane (Jeep Swenson), for example. In the comics, he's articulate and intelligent with a gift for strategy as well as being the one who Broke The Bat. Here, he's just a dumb piece of muscle although he kinda looks the part. Acting is beyond pitiful with Clooney being the most one-dimensional Bruce Wayne you'll ever see and everyone else not being much better. Thurman and Schwarzenegger try their best but the script is against them, burying any attempt at characterisation beneath a plethora of dreadful puns and silly costumes.I'll let you into a secret - when I start to watch any movie, it starts up with a score of 6 and gains a point for everything I like and loses one for things I don't. Thirty seconds after the opening credits had finished, this film was already a 3 and within five minutes, it had dropped to a 2. By the time of the pointless motorcycle race where every surface explodes in a shower of sparks for no reason whatsoever, I realised that I was watching something truly awful. It's one of the few films I can recall seeing that actually made me angry at such a wanton waste of money, time, effort (from everyone except the cast) and licence. One almost wonders if Clooney and director Joel Schumacher were trying to secretly kill the franchise because this was accomplished with such authority that it could only have been done by design. The only reason anyone would want to watch this was because Batman & Robin was the only Batman film they had not seen, as was the case with me. But take my word for it and don't bother.

Yes, World War II was raging, but society was different, and this movie was a product of that society. It's a simple, rather hopeful movie, filled with basically decent characters who perhaps have to have their hearts and souls stirred to connect with that decency. It's up to Father O'Malley (Bing Crosby) to find that innate decency in all of them and to bring it out.Essentially the movie revolves around the sometimes tense relationship between O'Malley and Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald.) Fitzgibbon has been the parish priest of St. Dominic's for 45 years, and now things aren't going well. The church is in financial trouble and is in danger of defaulting on its mortgage. The bishop sends O'Malley in to take charge - but without upsetting Fitzgibbon by telling him that O'Malley is in charge - a rather delicate balancing act. Along the way, O'Malley deals with the church busybody, a gang of street boys, a wayward young woman and the holder of the mortgage, and he reconnects with some old friends along the way.There was maybe a little bit too much going on. I realize that in all of these interactions the theme of O'Malley helping the various characters turn their lives around and develop heart and soul is present - perhaps, though, we didn't need so many story lines to keep hammering the theme away at us. Yes, I know I argued that we have to let go of jadedness, but this does seem somewhat unbelievable.

In fact, I enjoyed it less than its sort of sequel in 1947 - The Bells of St. Mary's, in which Bing Crosby reprised the role of Father O'Malley. That movie, I thought, was more focused; this one seemed to wander a bit much. It's also noteworthy for 2 of its nominations in particular - Barry Fitzgerald was nominated for both Best Actor (which Crosby won) and Best Supporting Actor (which Fitzgerald took)! That had never happened before and it can never happen again, because the Academy changed the rules afterward to prevent an actor from being nominated for two awards for the same role, so it's a noteworthy bit of background to the movie.I thought the movie was surprisingly (and I'm sure unintentionally) honest in having music producer Max Dolan (played by William Frawley) reject O'Malley's song Going My Way. As the title song of the movie, I really didn't think it was that good either! The tug at your heartstrings moment at the very end of the movie (which I won't give away) worked surprisingly well. It was emotional - and I didn't see it coming. I like being taken by surprise, so a point for that! If I thought that the movie itself was a bit overrated, I thought that Crosby and Fitzgerald were both quite good in their respective roles.

That movie, I thought, was more focused; this one seemed to wander a bit much. It's also noteworthy for 2 of its nominations in particular - Barry Fitzgerald was nominated for both Best Actor (which Crosby won) and Best Supporting Actor (which Fitzgerald took)! That had never happened before and it can never happen again, because the Academy changed the rules afterward to prevent an actor from being nominated for two awards for the same role, so it's a noteworthy bit of background to the movie.I thought the movie was surprisingly (and I'm sure unintentionally) honest in having music producer Max Dolan (played by William Frawley) reject O'Malley's song Going My Way. As the title song of the movie, I really didn't think it was that good either! The tug at your heartstrings moment at the very end of the movie (which I won't give away) worked surprisingly well. It was emotional - and I didn't see it coming. I like being taken by surprise, so a point for that! If I thought that the movie itself was a bit overrated, I thought that Crosby and Fitzgerald were both quite good in their respective roles. It's a little bit too long (probably because it does seem to lose its essential focus by trying to follow too many of O'Malley's relationships) but it's a pleasant, enjoyable film.

In case you are unfamiliar with the novel, here's a bit of background. Published in the 50s, Lolita is the pornographic tale of an 12 year old girl who engages in a lurid sexual relationship with her nympholeptic step-father. No, you didn't read that wrong I said TWELVE YEARS OLD!! Nabokov had a lot of trouble bringing the book to press - the only people who would touch it were some sex novel publishers - and Lyne had a lot of the same difficulty. Distributors were afraid that audiences would be offended, and so Lyne had to bring out the film on TV. With good reason! I can only say that it saddens me that Showtime ever gave this sorry excuse for a movie a chance...and also that they gave America's perverts a chance to watch it! You MUST keep your children away from this monstrosity at all costs cover their ears if you happen to chance across one of their classmates' progressive parents, shield their eyes whenever in the vicinity of a movie theatre, and if they should speak of this despicable film...well I at least wouldn't hesitate to give them the discipline that the movie's heroine so obviously needs. It is essential that you be alert for the possibility of corruption - a movie this scandalous will draw the seculars like butterflies to a flame. I hesitate to discuss the actual movie at all, out of a fear that even hearing about it might provoke your curiosity and lead you into temptation and also because reading about the movie is or should be a sin in itself. Even typing this out for you sends a shiver down my spine. In the end, though, I think that there is a greater good to be served by the certainty that I will deter readers who might otherwise have subjected themselves to the movie from that future error. Jeremy Irons plays the villainous Humbert Humbert, who comes to America in order to lecture at a reprehensibly elite college. He meets the disgusting Charlotte Haze, with whom he becomes a boarder and eventually a husband. This Haze woman, played by Melanie Griffith, is a portrait of vapid and loathsome sensuality. Her unveiled come-ons (before their marriage!) are absolutely sickening. In fact, this side of Griffith's portrayal is perhaps the movie's sole redeeming moral lesson the utter undesirability of this woman and the sexual so-called pleasures she has to offer should help us in our fervent quest to keep our children pure. This repugnant sensuality is clearly the element shared by the little and big Hazes. Dominique Swain, in the title role, magnifies her mother's charms to a monstrous degree. We see, for example, her reading the funny pages, hair lank with sweat and exertion, toes curling, tendons straining, rocking, breathing deeply, bare leg, breathing more deeply, moaning&#x85;before Lyne cruelly cuts away. Or later, we see the temptress prostitute herself for a raise in her allowance. Wherever did she learn to rub her hands so teasingly along her step-father's leg? The viewer, shuddering spasmodically, struggles to think. And Irons, with that bare, well-muscled chest, is hardly innocent in these exchanges either. Incidentally, I have not seen the film.

TNG could easily have been a goofy, unintentionally funny movie in someone else's hands. Kudos to the little formerly-house-arrested kiddie-fiddler for tackling such an idiotic (but fun) topic with such style and competence; not a small achievement by any means.

This brings up too many tricky and tacky issues, such as how long Satan(a) would breast-feed her child, whether the milk would be too hot for the toddler, how Satan(a) could possibly be gentle toward another being, etc.The question remains what purpose Seigner had. She is obviously either Satan(a) himself\/herself or just a kung-fu-skilled demoness sent on a mission. Was the mission's purpose to make sure Balkan fails, or was it to make sure Depp makes it to the Gate? Impossible to say. One can find logic flaws in both explanations, but inconsistency, self-contradiction and logic holes are hardly uncommon in matters related to either Christianity or Satanism. Why would Satan care about Depp's soul so much? Was it enticing to the Horned One to capture a soul that belongs to a non-believer?

As with a lot of Cameron's hits, this was an innovator in special effects. If it wasn't for this film, films such as The Matrix and Lord of the Rings would not be here or at least would not have been able to express themselves in a visual sense.Cameron is the ultimate director. Although he is a pain to work with, he gets his image across and proves why he is such a hit machine. No one compares to him when it comes to picking a cast. Even though most of this cast were, and still are, unknown, the performances in this are fantastic. I know I always praise him but Michael Biehn as Coffey is one of the best acting performances I have ever seen and the fact that Biehn was not even Oscar nominated is a travesty! He is great to watch as the maniac who is irate and just plain horrible. Ed Harris is on par with his good performances in The Rock and Apollo 13. You just want to be his mate in this movie despite the fact he is another pain (see Rock out takes) which is why him and Cameron have not spoken a word since this film.

Indeed, the basis for crime is less vileness than selfishness, call it greed, personal accomplishment, money, it's always egos talking. A criminal is naturally selfish and the vileness is only the consequence of a visceral absence of empathy.This is why honor among thieves works as an oxymoron, honor is by essence deprived from anything money-oriented or egotistical, therefore even the most meticulously set-up and ingenuously constructed plan, is meant to fail sooner or later, a criminal can't get over his true nature, which implies the lack of honor. Take all the classic dramatic heist movies (I won't list them to avoid spoilers), they ALL fail, it's not a golden rule, but otherwise, it would contradict the very essence of crime (getting money for noble cause is hardly what motivates gangsters and thieves when they steal jewels).Now, how can this doom be such an obligatory element without providing a sense of predictability? Simply because it's never about heists, it's all about characters, Melville knew that, Kubrick did and before them, Huston. The element of failure is the only redeeming quality a criminal can afford, without it, there couldn't become sympathetic antiheroes. A gangster can only inspire by the way he tries to rise himself above his condition with morality and principles, only be betrayed by less ethical persons, villains within villain plot-wise. The big sister of failure is a notion always cherished by the film-noir genre fatality. So, it's not surprising that the greatest caper films belong to the noir genre and that The Asphalt Jungle is a landmark since there is no heist film that you can't connect with it. It's not surprising either that it's precisely John Huston who introduced all the formulas of the perfect-crime-that-ultimately-fails, since most of his films dealt directly or indirectly with failures and losers The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The Misfits, The Night of the Iguana ... Huston had a unique ability to provide an extraordinarily tragic dimension to low-life characters. Emmerich's quote foreshadows a treachery, even more saddening, because it's caused by the greed of one person, and worsened when the intermediary, Cobby, the weakling bookie played by Mark Lawrence, rats about the heist.Still, and this is what transcends The Asphalt Jungle into a gripping masterpiece of realism, is that it never falls in the trap of Manichaeism, Huston's writing and directing provides to each character a human touch inviting us to feel some sympathy. Emmerich is the most heart breaking because he only betrays the team by necessity not by personal greed, what's more; encouraged by a unscrupulous detective played by Brad Dexter. Emmerich is broke after having wasted money by loaning money and make a sweet kid played by Marilyn Monroe -in one of her first roles, as the doll face who'd call hum 'Uncle Lon'- feel like a man, who still 'had it', whatever it was. Her unforgettable alibi couldn't fool the cops. Unable to get his money back, and to match his reputation, he was doom. They all were.In this film so rich of distinct personalities, the one who managed to get himself an Oscar nomination, the great character actor Sam Jaffe as Erwin 'Doc' Riedenschneider, dreamed of Mexico, a paradise of sun and pretty girls, a benign and comprehensible appetite that would cause his demise. He who was the mastermind, anticipating Emmerich's double-cross and every single detail, let a small weakness cause his demise. Starting from his very choice of intermediary, Cobby as the one whose lack of honor made him put the deathblow when threatened by a corrupt officer, he resigned himself to give all the names Louis Ciavelli, the safe-cracker (Anthony Caruso), Gus, the hunchbacked getaway driver (James Whitmore in a remarkable performance), 'Doc', and the pillar of the film Sterling Hayden as Dix Handley.Sterling Hayden, with his gravelly voice and sensual lower-lip, embodies all the torment that can ravage the heart of a hooligan, the bad-conscience in a good heart. Heart is important because it commands love and empathy, therefore principles and honor, elements that lacked in Cobby, the snitch, who didn't even have enough love to his own self-esteem to shut his mouth. And the tragedy of men like Gus, Dix, Louis and Doc is that they were no less criminal than Cobby, Emmerich or his detective, but they somewhat conveyed the idea of 'honor among thieves', that a man should respect his word, and their doom is that we were ahead of them, anticipating the human factor.Naturally, beyond these existential undertones, the film features a long heist sequence, with no score, no special effects, and an almost documentary-like value that probably remind of Melville's Cercle Rouge, but these ten minutes still foreshadowed the tragedy. After all the precautions taken to avoid the alarm, the explosion caused by the soup (nitro-glycerine) activated other alarms, and cause the intervention of a cop who wounded Ciavelli in an almost tragicomic way.

A delightful sci-fi comedy about aliens who accidentally mistake a corny Sci-Fi TV-show for historical documents and kidnap the actors to help them, this is a great, fun family film.Eighteen years ago, Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), Alexander Dane (Rickman), Fred Kwan (Shalhoub), Gwen Demarco (Weaver) and Tommy Webber (Darryl Mitchell) were the stars of Galaxy Quest, a popular Star Trek-esque TV series about a group of space explorers who get into various adventures across the galaxy. After the show was canceled, none of their careers really took off, and they now spend their times making appearances in character at store openings and Sci-Fi conventions for fans. All are sad, and yearn for their fame, living in the past.However, a group of Thermions, aliens from a faraway world, have intercepted TV signals of the old show, and mistaken them for actual historical documents. The aliens kidnap the confused actors in order to help them fight a ruthless space dictator named Sirus, whom is threatening to destroy their world. The Thermions use the show to re-create all of the ships and technology, forcing the actors to play the role of a lifetime- to live out their fantasy roles in the real world.The film is very light-hearted and very funny. The cast works very well together, particularly Allen (whom is basically playing a riff on William Shatner) and Rickman (a surrogate Leonard Nimoy character). Weaver, Shalhoub and Mithcell are all hilarious as well, and Sam Rockwell as a bit-part actor who is inadvertently brought along (despite only appearing in one episode of the show) is a joy to watch in particular. Other notable appearances include a charming young Justin Long in a small role as an uber-fan, and Enrico Colantoni, Missi Pyle and Patrick Breen as some of the principal Thermions, whom are innocent, goofy aliens with big hearts and clueless brains.The film has plenty of good humor. There are some bawdy, risqué jokes but for the most part, everything is clean and family-friendly. There is also some fantastic meta-humor for fans of sci-fi and adults. The script is very tight and very charming, and characters all are well established and well-written. The visual direction is quite stunning, and despite being released more than 10-years-ago, the effects hold up surprisingly well compared to today's films. There is also a surprising amount of honest suspense in the film, and some shocking emotional moments.That being said, this is not a perfect film. For one, it isn't particularly long at 102 minutes, and it takes a while for the story to set itself up, so it could have used a bit more padding around the middle- it involves too much screen time with the plot, and not enough with the fun in many scenes. Also, it does bog itself down in a lot of scenes trying to over-explain certain aspects of the story. Finally, there are some very big questions left over that are never explained. (Ex. How the aliens could re-create everything, including the fabled Omega 13 Device, which was never explained completely on the show. This part of the story doesn't make much sense.)That being said, though, this is still a very fun film, and despite it's faults and questionable logic, should not be missed. I give this a near-perfect 9 out of 10, strictly for the great humor that will put a huge smile on your face. See this movie, you won't regret it!

Goal, a non-profit agency dedicated to helping such people through a variety of programs, and it's next to impossible to tell them apart from the other actors. Nelson and her co-writer, Kristine Johnson, spent a lot of time at L.A. Goal doing research, as did Penn. Pfeiffer perfectly executes a complex character who has to undergo a number of far reaching transformations and even a breakdown of sorts. As for Fanning, I haven't seen her in a film yet where she didn't threaten to steal the whole thing from her senior, much more experienced colleagues, and during the filming of I Am Sam she was only 6 or 7. Wiest, Richard Schiff, Laura Dern and others also turn in very complex performances that convey characters with deep, multifaceted histories, despite their relatively little screen time.

After the success of the Star Wars toy line from Hasbro, the industry began a series of fantasy toy lines that used the 30 minute Saturday morning cartoon as an advertising tool. This led to famous toy's\/cartoons such as Tranformers, Thundercats et al (there are way too many to list in this review. I believe the first of these was the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, which hawked a band of sword-and-sandal-like fantasy characters, in a world called Eternia.The cartoon and toy line were incredibly successful, and whilst as an adult, my cynical side sees the enormity of this exploitative marketing, as a child I was totally sucked in. With the unbridled achievement of cynical marketing, it was only a matter of time before the Hollywood machine would take the buff character of He-man and immortalise the c**t on screen.The 1980's also saw an increase of over sized muscle-men on the big screen. This was of course reflective of Reagan's politics of big-is- good etcetera. So with such a low-rent project, the film needed a pretty low-rent, muscular actor. I'm guessing that even Schwarzenegger and Stallone were too good for this film, as the actor chosen to play the homo-erotic, buff-dunce He-man was Dolph Lundgren, another of the increasingly large action stars of the decade.The story involves a set of keys that can open a portal to other worlds\/dimensions, and He-man's evil foe, Skeletor (Frank Langela) obviously wants the set. During a battle in Snake mountain, the hero's are forced to go through a portal where they find themselves in contemporary America, and take on the help of a native, Julie (Courtney Cox).This derivative, insipid film is just awful. The action is more than likely placed in a Earth-bound setting for budgetary reasons. And to be fair, even if this was not the case, it would probably be just as s**t. I did see this at the cinema at the time, and probably liked it. But seeing this as an adult just makes me realise that there was an abundance of genuinely awful movies in the decade of greed.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"25 February 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" During the 1980's the world of advertising and general marketing took on an all invasive, sinister tone.
