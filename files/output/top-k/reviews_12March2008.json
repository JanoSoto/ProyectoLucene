It wasn't until a few years ago that I sat down and watched the original fantasia, and fell in love with it. I respected and treated it as a piece of art, I believe that Fantasia is for the older generation, as children seem to lose concentration whilst watching the longer segments. One of the reasons I love it is because it engages you in the classical music (I have never been interested in classical music). Also I think the animations are so well thought out, and are all detailed, clever and uplifting. When I first watched Fantasia, i wasn't expecting to be as amazed. I loved the idea of Fantasia carrying on, but i think it had been left to long for a sequel. But after watching it, it took my breath away. It was as beautiful, marvellous and as magical as the original. All of the different segments were impressive, and here is my view on all of them1. Symphony #5 - This opening sequence was a great one to open the film. It was full of colour and the music was so powerful. I would have loved to have seen this sequence in the IMAX cinema. The story involved thousands of colourful triangles being ambushed (and hugely outnumbered) by evil black triangles. The triangles cleverly resembled butterflies, and was an amazing simple story about good and evil. I think the visual worked hand in hand with the music, which really comes right out of the screen at you. This segment is an experience to watch and I think it was one of the most powerful sequences in the film. 9\/102. Pines of Rome - This is segment with the flying whales, probably the most loved from fantasia 2000 and the most sought after. This segment is like life therapy from just watching it. Its happy and emotional and celebrates life. I think the computer animated whales against a cell animated background is an interesting ides and seems to work marvellously. I think it was great of the Disney team to use an unknown piece of music here, because it really draws the audience in. I really love this piece, i love the mellow colours, the story and even the introduction. But i have to say it isn't my favourite segment. 8\/103. Rhapsody in Blue - This is my favourite segment in the film, I think it's unique and original. I love the music, although it does become quite repetitive. And I love the caricature style animation. The story is set in, Ney York and the animators have drawn in the style of an old New York newspaper comic strip which i think is really interesting and effective. The story is about several depressed people of all shapes and sizes who all have a dream. At the end of the sequence, each of the caricatures accidentally help each other out into the achieving there goals, which ends in an amazing celebratory finale. 10\/10 4. Piano Concerto #2, Allegro, Opus 102 (The Steadfast Tin Soldier) - The one thing which I think annoyed me about this segment, is the fact that Disney picked the story first and then found a piece of music to match. For all the other segments, they listened to a piece of music and then let the images flow through there heads. But other then that it is a good heart warming story which really captures your emotions. I think all of the characters are really interesting and beautifully created. Disney changed the ending to this sequence from a miserable ending to happy one. I think this is typical of Disney and i would have thought it would have been more interesting to see the soldier not get the ballerina. 7\/10 5. Carnival of the Animals, Finale - A colourful, but annoying and childish sequence. This segment is the shortest segment and I think it the most disappointing. The flamingos are predictable and unoriginal, but it entertains the children for a little while. I think it is a satisfactory element to the film, and brings a slight smile but nothing else. 5\/10 6. The Sorcerer's Apprentice - This is an absolute classic and should not be frowned upon in any way. Walt Disney said himself that he wanted old classics in the follow ups and that is what this is. 9\/10 7. Pomp and Circumstance - I think this piece is in great competition with the sorcerers apprentice, Disney animators obviously thought long and hard about what they wanted to achieve, and they have come up with an amazing sequence. This segment is funny, entertain in and moving and is one of those fantasia elements in which make you smile. I loved it, i loved the story in which Donald and Daisy Duch lose each other on the Gigantic Noah's Arc. 8\/10 8. Firebird Suite - 1919 - Definitely the most powerful in the entire project. I think this is probably the best sequence in all of fantasia (including the original). I think it is even more beautiful then 'The nutcracker suite' in Fantasia. It is a great finale for a great film. It is about death and rebirth in nature and Disney portrays this wonderfully. You have to see Fantasia 2000 just for this sequence, because it is a life changing animation that should go down in history.The introductions - I think these were tacky and pointless. I think it would have been much more successful if they stuck to one host...Preferably James Earl Jones.

Among this, we are supposed to find a plot in the fact that this supreme klutz with her horrible taste in clothes is trying to find true love between two different men &#150; or between two different sets of bed sheets. Bridgett does one mistake after another and can't seem to keep her goal on anything.The viewers are supposed to believe that while she is having rampant kinky sex with Hugh Grant, the real love of her life, Colin Firth, is watching with longing from a distance. He has issues with the Hugh Grant character that are not revealed until the end, even though all the evidence is very clear that Grant is the one in the wrong. After all, Bridgett, look what he did to you.In the meantime, we are supposed to swallow the fact that Firth's character is still crazy about Bridget and forget the fact that &#150; out of the celluloid &#150; a normal man would probably think twice or more about getting involved with a woman &#150; any woman &#150; who was sexually involved with the man who broke up his marriage. Very neat, huh? And oh, so romantic, that this is not even mentioned. Yeah, right! Ask any jealous husband or wife in the same situation.If England thinks this type of movie &#150; with the ending line by Firth's character, which not surprising includes one last offensive F word remark &#150; is romantic, then no wonder their divorce and illegitimate children rates are up! There are two other points that have to be addressed when discussing this first Bridget Jones movie. I heard that the writer watched Pride and Prejudice and modeled Colin Firth's character from the Mr. Darcy character he portrayed in the P&P movie. I wonder what hallucinogenic drugs she was on while watching the A&E production? Another item I heard was that using Renée Zellweger as Bridget Jones was in essence like using Vivian Leigh as Scarlet O'Hara. Yeah, right. Only Scarlet slept around after marriage and basically wasn't a slut! Furthermore, Vivian Leigh could act.

Manipulative beauty is one of the best plot foundations imaginable. Our society does not educate men to stand up to the force of face, figure and hormonal stimulation but simply acknowledges they're hopelessly outgunned by the relentless forces of natural selection.

Vivien Leigh's Scarlet O'Hara, Lana Turner's Cora Smith, Hedy Lamar's Delilah, Bella Darvi's Nefer in The Egyptian, and Sharron Stone's Catherine Trammel come to mind right away.

The best part of the movie in my mind is that there are several different characters with their own very different personalities. Another great part of the movie is how advanced the special effects were. The scene where Dorothy gets caught in the twister and she sees things fly by her window seems pretty advanced for 1939. This movie is great because of how it appeals not just to children, but adults too. One of greatest things about the film is how the mise en scene is incorporated into it by director Victor Fleming. Mise en scene is a wide array of elements seen on camera. These different elements in the Wizard of Oz include the set and how it is arranged, the characters and their different dynamics and the props used by those characters. As I have stated in my title I think this movie is amazing and it has had one of the greatest impacts on films we see today. In the film The Wizard of Oz directed by Victor Fleming, Fleming understands the importance of mise en scene and utilizes his set, characters, and props to lift the mise en scene to a different dimension which, in turn, has enabled his film to become one of the true classics and most renowned movies of all time.There are a lot of factors that go into making a great film and the sets are probably one of the least focused on, but is one of the most important. In the movie there are several different places that the story takes place so that means there are several different backdrops and props. In the beginning when Dorothy is in Kansas the set is set up as a typical mid western farm. The house used is your typical wooden house with a large front porch with a wooden rocking chair. The back drop has the image of a overcast day. Just from the backdrop you can tell that the weather is going to get bad. Later when the twister begins to hit the house you can look at the background and tell that there are little twisters moving around and that there are fans blowing the actors and the set to give you that twister felling. During this whole time the set has been film in black and white which gives the whole set the dark and dreary feeling. Once the house lands from the twister and Dorothy gets up and walks outside the rest of the film is shot in color which gives the rest of the film a brighter more vibrant feel to it. Now that the film is in color the director can now use certain colors in the set to set the mood of the scene. For instance the director chose to make the road yellow which is a bright, exciting color. Every time Dorothy and her friends are on that road they are being lead to the next part of the story and if they were on a simple dirt road there wouldn't be any excitement or anticipation when there on it.Another important part of a movie is the characters and how they dress and interact with each other. The first character introduced to us in the story is Dorothy played by Judy Garland is a young farm girl from Kansas. Dorothy throughout the film has a very imaginative and curious personality. Her costume is the same thru-out the movie, she is wearing a simple flannel pull over dress. This would be a typical dress for a girl that lives in the mid west in the 1930's. The only costume change she had in the film is when she changed shoes to the ones she saw on the feet of the witch. The next character Dorothy runs across is the Scarecrow who is played by Ray Bolger. The personality of the scarecrow in this film is very flamboyant; the scarecrow had a lot of dancing scenes in the film as well. The main personality of the scarecrow is that he is brainless which is the reason why he is heading to see the Wizard of Oz with Dorothy to get that brain. The costume of the Scarecrow is very detailed, with face paint and his raggedy overalls with straw sticking out. The next character they run across is the Tin Man. The Tin Man is played by Jack Haley. The personality of the Tin Man was heartless and he was looking to ask the wizard for a heart. The costume of the Tin Man was made out of aluminum and the face paint was an aluminum color to match. The Cowardly Lion who was play by Bert Lahr was the final character to join Dorothy on her quest to the Wizard of Oz. The Cowardly lion's personality is very shy and nervous. The Lion was looking to ask the Wizard for some courage so he could be brave. The costume of the lion was a suit that had a tail and a main sown on to it. All the different characters personalities were complemented by Dorothy's overwhelming personality.There are several reasons why this film is a classic. Maybe it's because it was way ahead of its time, but whatever the reason this film will be watched by kids and adults for many years to come.

Usually when you see kids in a horror movie that's the death knell right there, but these kids are top notch performers -- Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin.

In fact, maybe the screenplay is loosely autobiographical? A lonely millionaire seeks out an expensive female escort to keep him company in a five-star Las Vegas hotel... I was also surprised that Paul Auster had sunk so low as to waste his time on such cretinous and pointless material.This is what I refer to as a lifeless movie. D.O.A. The mood is dead, the visual style (filmed mostly on video - whoopdie!) is more bland than your dull neighbour's sea holiday footage. The hip shaky-camera shtick gives yet again the impression of a drunken director of photography who stuck his camera you-know-where and then filmed the movie from behind, randomly taking in images, sometimes missing the actors completely. The near-lack of a soundtrack only underlines the deadness of everyone and everything involved. Was this crap inspired by Idiots 95, Lars von Trier's wonderful little crackpot cinematic-revolution firm? The wobbly camera, the sex, the ugly look, and the lack of music certainly adhere to the rules of Morons 95. We're offered two lead characters who are uninteresting and bland. I could almost see Molly Parker as a stripper (although, they're usually rather mangy-looking), but when it is mentioned that she fixed car-locks and plays the drums, I could have laughed. I could have but didn't, because the movie had already put me in a semi-slumber during its first several minutes. Parker plays an uninteresting, mentally hollow stripper; Sarsgaard plays a run-of-the-mill nice guy an uninteresting rich and polite semi-nerd. When the two of them were together sparks flew! No, not really... But I'm sure that Ms.Wang intended to have us see those sparks - wherever they may be. Where have those sparks gone? Or were they never even thrown in the film in the first place? Ms.Wang, you need to find out who took those sparks that were meant to be in all those sexy, emotional scenes. I think someone stole them. Or perhaps the sparks abandoned the set, running as fast as their feet(?) could carry them, unwilling to have anything to do with this dull project.Thank God for the miracle of modern science! No, not the internet, computers, or DNA research; I'm talking about the remote control. Using this simple yet effective tool, I managed to finish this 85-minute movie in less than 70 minutes. I know, still too long for this malarkey, but that's at least 15 minutes of my life saved, and every minute counts when you're as bored as I was, watching Ms.Parker try to be sexy with her laughable stripping and tiny butt.So what was the ultimate point of this shamelessly plot-less film? Basically, this is a when-is-the-penetration-gonna-happen kind of story. At the outset of their Las Vegas adventure Parker tells Sarsgaard and the poor viewers that there will be no kissing and no penetration, but even the most clueless viewer knows that that's exactly what has to happen at some point. And when it happens it's... it's... rather uninteresting, just like all the previous events. In that great finale they kiss, they have (un)emotional sex, Parker is still frigid, Sarsgaard is still in love - and sobs like a baby after just having semi-raped Parker. He did that to her because he was heavily frustrated. 10,000 bucks and such disrespect? Ts, ts... Maybe the message of the film is this rich semi-nerdy young millionaires are often unable to get the proper sexual escort service that they really need. Wow.

For starters, this sequel decently succeeds in having the nightmarish quality that the parts following lacked. Freddy has no one liners, seems peed off, and has no problem killing someone brutally. So horror buffs rejoice. Freddy also has a certain look towards him that makes him scary to look at in this one. This sequels mythology also is pretty decent. It tries to set up a whole new agenda for Freddy and it actually makes sense. If you ask me this sequel's story could have been told AFTER Dream Child, it would have given the series the horror jolt it needed. It seems Freddy is trapped in Dream World and a new family has moved into the Freddy house (actually Nancy's house, how it became Freddy's house is beyond me). It seems Freddy can't kill anymore so he's using the son Jesse's (Mark Patton) body as sort of a vessel so he can kill in the real world instead of Dreams. See, it defiantly would have been better if this concept was used after Dream Child. That's basically the plot this time around, as indeed Freddy systematically takes over Jesse, and continues to kill, while Jesse may or may not take the blame. The Director shows competence (check out the school bus dream), and definitely brought a lot of style to this nightmare, I dug it the most. Christopher young's score is also on the ball, elevating the movie to a more scary level. I love this guys stuff, and the movie wouldn't be half as scary without it. At times it sounds like whales moaning in pain or something, pretty creepy. The problems that this movie has (for me) is our main lead Jesse. Not only was the actor a whiny suck, he also screamed like a girl, dressed like crap, and basically turned down all the help that was offer. How can anyone incest in someone like that? It certainly hurt the scare factor for since, since he was to despicable. This would lead to another controversial aspect this sequel has. Many tend to see it as a metaphor for a homosexual coming to terms with his sexuality. Take the scene where Jesse walk into the living room and says My god, it is hot as an oven in here, or the one night where for no reason out hero walks into a queer S&M establishment and gets picked up by the sadist gym instructor. Huh? Or the scene where the lead tries to have sex with the female lead(a very Meryl Streepish look alike) only to re think it and then decides he rather spend the night at his male buddies place. Scenes like this are all over the place to poke fun at if that's your thing,I also think the ending of this movie is underwhelming to say the least, and has a love conquers all attitude. Basically saying I LOVE YOU can defeat Freddy this time around? Not only does that seem a feeble attempt, but it also has no real purpose since the last frame has signs that Freddy is still kicking.Freddy also crashes a pool party this time but I found it to be cut to short to really leave an impression. Why was everyone so scared anyways? The winks to part one were appreciated, and the gore and SFX are quite icky, and some scenes stand out with picture clarity, Rottweilers with disfigured baby faces, Freddy ripping off his scalp, a mutant cat eating a rat, Freddy coming out of our hero's body, the scenes of Freddy lurking about, all done with a creepy excellence, this sequel succeeds in giving me some BRRRRRS.

Wood, Jr. played perfectly by Johnny Depp. The film covers Ed's life up to the release of Plan 9 From Outer Space but the true heart of the movie centers on Wood's relationship with a washed up Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). To me this is perhaps the greatest film about the making of movies because of how it shows the ups and downs even though the majority of Wood's life were full of downs. The movie is about a lot of things and includes many great jabs at Hollywood but the true brilliance of the film is in its relationship between Wood and Lugosi. This here is where the movie really jumps off the screen because the love story between these two struggling men is where the heart is at and it's these scenes that are going to make the movie last for a very long time. The beautiful B&W cinematography also stands out and Burton has no trouble at building up a realistic setting. I know Burton will always be best known for his big budget action pictures but there's no question this here is his greatest work. The amount of time and detail in every shot jumps off the screen for various reasons but one is the performance from Depp. The way Depp brings Wood to life is something incredible to watch as his always joyful personality jumps out at the viewer and grabs ahold of them making him impossible not to love. As great as Depp is though the film still belongs to Landau who rightfully won an Oscar for his role as Bela Lugosi. Having seen nearly every Lugosi film available, I'm still shocked at how well Landau does him to this day. After numerous viewings of this film I still can't believe at how well Landau got his accent as well as certain gestures and moves. Depp and Landau together make for one of the most beloved duos in film history. Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Jeffrey JOnes, Vincent D'Onofrio, Juliet Landau and Bill Murray all turns in strong supporting performances as well. Mike Starr, as producer Georgie Weiss, also sticks out in a great comedic performance. I can't think of too many film's that contain a bigger heart than this one. Not only showing the love between Wood and Lugosi but also being able to show respect and love for this type of movie.

Wood, Jr. played perfectly by Johnny Depp. The film covers Ed's life up to the release of Plan 9 From Outer Space but the true heart of the movie centers on Wood's relationship with a washed up Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). To me this is perhaps the greatest film about the making of movies because of how it shows the ups and downs even though the majority of Wood's life were full of downs. The movie is about a lot of things and includes many great jabs at Hollywood but the true brilliance of the film is in its relationship between Wood and Lugosi. This here is where the movie really jumps off the screen because the love story between these two struggling men is where the heart is at and it's these scenes that are going to make the movie last for a very long time. The beautiful B&W cinematography also stands out and Burton has no trouble at building up a realistic setting. I know Burton will always be best known for his big budget action pictures but there's no question this here is his greatest work. The amount of time and detail in every shot jumps off the screen for various reasons but one is the performance from Depp. The way Depp brings Wood to life is something incredible to watch as his always joyful personality jumps out at the viewer and grabs ahold of them making him impossible not to love. As great as Depp is though the film still belongs to Landau who rightfully won an Oscar for his role as Bela Lugosi. Having seen nearly every Lugosi film available, I'm still shocked at how well Landau does him to this day. After numerous viewings of this film I still can't believe at how well Landau got his accent as well as certain gestures and moves. Depp and Landau together make for one of the most beloved duos in film history. Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Jeffrey JOnes, Vincent D'Onofrio, Juliet Landau and Bill Murray all turns in strong supporting performances as well. Mike Starr, as producer Georgie Weiss, also sticks out in a great comedic performance. I can't think of too many film's that contain a bigger heart than this one.

'Fargo' is like many Coen brothers films the story of a stupid crime gone horribly wrong. You can relate it to their Oscar winning film this year 'No COuntry for Old Men' in some ways.Fargo is arguably the Coen Brother's best movie (though personally I think it's their second-best, after No Country For Old Men). I was pleasantly surprised by the simplicity of the storyline, as many movies concerning crime are often too fast paced and reliant on plot twists. Instead, Fargo's plot develops more through the characters than through what is actually occurring on the screen. The characters themselves, especially Jerry Lundegard, are very well thought out and work in perfect unison with the simplicity of the story. There are no hard-boiled, cynical detectives here, just a simple policewoman who uses basic techniques to outwit her inexperienced counterparts.Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is in deep debt after committing some major fraud at his father-in-law's car dealership, so he comes up with a scheme to have his wife kidnapped in order for his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom. Unfortunately, the men he hires (Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi) are not only completely unstable and scary but share a half a brain among them. What was supposed to be a simple kidnapping culminates in the murder of three innocent bystanders. Enter Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) a small-town sheriff, who also happens to be seven months pregnant, who steps in to try to solve the case.'Fargo' has so many things going for it Phenomenal acting (McDormand won a well-deserved Oscar for her role) by all players, supporting and lead and a brilliant script that is part mystery, part thriller and part drama and all layered in a thin veneer of some of the darkest comedy seen in recent years, are just two of the outstanding elements. The cinematography of 'Fargo' however is absolutely beautiful. The snow white landscape is so stark and vast; yet suddenly you realize that you are watching a tiny figure in the distance, trudging through the snow; and it's one of the main characters. One shot in particular is so unbelievably framed, that for a good ten seconds, the viewer isn't entirely sure what they are looking at, until it becomes obvious that it is a deserted parking lot with one car parked in the middle of it. Scenes like these are literally breath-taking and hearkens back to some of the beautiful cinematography in one of their earlier films, 'Millers Crossing'.'Fargo' is one of those movies you watch a dozen times a month then forget about it for a few months. After the few months, you pop it in again and the whole movie is brand new again. I recommend everyone watch this movie even if you are not a Cohen Brothers fan. The great thing about the brothers movies is that even if you don't share their same sense of humor and don't laugh once, the movies they make still hold up with their great stories. But if you do share the same sense of humor, the comedy is just another layer of greatness. Fargo has everything; suspense, a good story, humor, brilliant acting and a score that accompanies the visuals perfectly.

Before addressing the film itself, a few words about its co-star, Laurence Harvey. Harvey became a star at an awkward time in cinema history, the late fifties and early sixties, when so much of society and entertainment were in transition. He might be considered the last of a breed the dashing leading man who was a mainstay in films of the thirties and forties but was rapidly becoming out-of-date. With his British accent (he was actually born in Lithuania) and matinée-idol good looks, Laurence Harvey was ever the suave, debonair, well-spoken man of taste, equally adept at portraying a tragic figure or a heartless heel, and he played each type on several occasions. When he did play a hero, he did so with élan, never more so than in 'The Alamo,' where he was cast to perfection as Colonel William Travis. Without a doubt the best part of that film, Harvey's interpretation of Travis, with all the gallantry, conceit, and courage that it entailed, puts to shame the later one by Patrick Wilson. Harvey starred opposite Elizabeth Taylor in her Oscar-winning 'Butterfield 8,' and it is a testament to his abilities that he maintained his dignity even while spouting some of the worst dialogue imaginable. His career declined in the late sixties; one of his last performances was on an episode of Rod Serling's Night Gallery entitled 'The Caterpillar,' a memorably creepy tale. He died all too young at the age of 45. And 'The Manchurian Candidate' was certainly a high point in his career, as it was for the rest of its stars; Frank Sinatra, Janet Leigh, and Angela Lansbury.The plot concerns an American soldier, Raymond Shaw (Harvey), who is captured during the Korean War and programmed via brainwashing to become an assassin. The other members of his platoon are brainwashed as well, but only to forget what happened, their memories replaced with one of Shaw bravely rescuing them singlehandedly, which leads to Shaw becoming a Medal of Honor winner and national hero. His mother (Angela Lansbury) is married to a U.S. Senator whom she controls completely, just as she has always manipulated Raymond's life. Eventually, we learn that she is in league with Shaw's communist controllers, and the plan is for Shaw to assassinate a presidential nominee, thus propelling her husband to the top spot and ultimately the presidency itself. The film is audacious in suggesting that it is a right wing political operative who collaborates with the Chinese and Russian communists, though Angela Lansbury's character almost certainly uses that political affiliation precisely because it provides the perfect cover. She is a pure monster, and Lansbury's smooth, reasonable manner makes her deviousness even creepier. Frank Sinatra plays Ben Marco, Shaw's commanding officer in Korea and the one who eventually unravels the mystery. It's easy to forget that Sinatra could be a very fine actor on occasion, and this is surely the best movie he ever appeared in. He underplays the role effectively, and much of his time on screen is spent listening to or reacting to other characters. Janet Leigh's character Rosie is somewhat mysterious; she and Marco get married (after what seems about a half-hour courtship) and they have a couple of very strange conversations that critics to this day are at odds to explain; one can't help wonder what the purpose of Rosie's character really is. But it is Laurence Harvey who is the focal point of the film and his character is the glue that holds the disparate elements together. I mentioned the tragic characters Harvey became known for portraying, and there certainly was none more tragic than Raymond Shaw. There is an irony in that he was a man who was tortured inside before he was ever brainwashed; by the end of the film, he has been run through the ringer so many times, by so many different people, he is all but hollowed out. And yet from somewhere deep within himself, Shaw finds just enough strength of purpose left to do the right thing; for once in his life, to set a great wrong right, by killing the corrupt senator instead of the nominee, and his mother. Then he puts on his Medal of Honor and kills himself. Marco remembers him and eulogizes him as, poor friendless, friendless Raymond.

Eventually, we learn that she is in league with Shaw's communist controllers, and the plan is for Shaw to assassinate a presidential nominee, thus propelling her husband to the top spot and ultimately the presidency itself. The film is audacious in suggesting that it is a right wing political operative who collaborates with the Chinese and Russian communists, though Angela Lansbury's character almost certainly uses that political affiliation precisely because it provides the perfect cover. She is a pure monster, and Lansbury's smooth, reasonable manner makes her deviousness even creepier. Frank Sinatra plays Ben Marco, Shaw's commanding officer in Korea and the one who eventually unravels the mystery. It's easy to forget that Sinatra could be a very fine actor on occasion, and this is surely the best movie he ever appeared in. He underplays the role effectively, and much of his time on screen is spent listening to or reacting to other characters. Janet Leigh's character Rosie is somewhat mysterious; she and Marco get married (after what seems about a half-hour courtship) and they have a couple of very strange conversations that critics to this day are at odds to explain; one can't help wonder what the purpose of Rosie's character really is. But it is Laurence Harvey who is the focal point of the film and his character is the glue that holds the disparate elements together. I mentioned the tragic characters Harvey became known for portraying, and there certainly was none more tragic than Raymond Shaw. There is an irony in that he was a man who was tortured inside before he was ever brainwashed; by the end of the film, he has been run through the ringer so many times, by so many different people, he is all but hollowed out. And yet from somewhere deep within himself, Shaw finds just enough strength of purpose left to do the right thing; for once in his life, to set a great wrong right, by killing the corrupt senator instead of the nominee, and his mother. Then he puts on his Medal of Honor and kills himself. Marco remembers him and eulogizes him as, poor friendless, friendless Raymond.

Before addressing the film itself, a few words about its co-star, Laurence Harvey. Harvey became a star at an awkward time in cinema history, the late fifties and early sixties, when so much of society and entertainment were in transition. He might be considered the last of a breed the dashing leading man who was a mainstay in films of the thirties and forties but was rapidly becoming out-of-date. With his British accent (he was actually born in Lithuania) and matinée-idol good looks, Laurence Harvey was ever the suave, debonair, well-spoken man of taste, equally adept at portraying a tragic figure or a heartless heel, and he played each type on several occasions. When he did play a hero, he did so with élan, never more so than in 'The Alamo,' where he was cast to perfection as Colonel William Travis. Without a doubt the best part of that film, Harvey's interpretation of Travis, with all the gallantry, conceit, and courage that it entailed, puts to shame the later one by Patrick Wilson. Harvey starred opposite Elizabeth Taylor in her Oscar-winning 'Butterfield 8,' and it is a testament to his abilities that he maintained his dignity even while spouting some of the worst dialogue imaginable. His career declined in the late sixties; one of his last performances was on an episode of Rod Serling's Night Gallery entitled 'The Caterpillar,' a memorably creepy tale. He died all too young at the age of 45. And 'The Manchurian Candidate' was certainly a high point in his career, as it was for the rest of its stars; Frank Sinatra, Janet Leigh, and Angela Lansbury.The plot concerns an American soldier, Raymond Shaw (Harvey), who is captured during the Korean War and programmed via brainwashing to become an assassin. The other members of his platoon are brainwashed as well, but only to forget what happened, their memories replaced with one of Shaw bravely rescuing them singlehandedly, which leads to Shaw becoming a Medal of Honor winner and national hero. His mother (Angela Lansbury) is married to a U.S. Senator whom she controls completely, just as she has always manipulated Raymond's life. Eventually, we learn that she is in league with Shaw's communist controllers, and the plan is for Shaw to assassinate a presidential nominee, thus propelling her husband to the top spot and ultimately the presidency itself.

It's loaded with bigger budget, more characters, more of everything actually. The Nightmare series was on the brink of its multi-.million dollar fame and before Freddy got watered down and basically shifted into his comedian phase we had this movie. The movie has no seemingly apparent interest in part 2 and could easily be the 2 of the series since it expands from 1's origins and never once mentions the events in 2. So this could actually be the REAL sequel to 1, I think 2 was to ahead of the mythology of the series and should have been made after Dream Child (5 in the series). The plot focuses on the remaining Elm Street children all rounded up in the local mental hospital, where the skeptical staff tends to them. It seems Freddy has been alive and kicking and has been still terrorizing dreams. The movie opens with one of the children Kristen (Patricia Arquette) trying desperately to stay awake (by spooning down coffee mix) and making models of the house she's been dreaming of. Well efforts aside, she has a dream and we are basically thrown into a much different approach then the proceeded. The movie is bombarded with SFX, the Elm street house is pimped up to one spooky setting, and the first stalk sequence is a good example of what's instore for the audience. Anyway, after barely getting killed by the Fredster, Kristen joins her fellow survivors in the asylum where quite conveniently joined up by part one's heroine Nancy. She is now a dream doctor (or something) and once realizing what the kids are up against she embarks them on a mission to fight back. It is discovered that Kristen also has a gift of pulling in people to her &#133;consciousness&#133;in order for everyone to dream the same dream. Alas, when doing this Nancy is able to have every dreamer obtain a certain power, which they use to battle Freddy. That is basically the premise as the last half of the movie is a series of event showing some do battle and fail, and some warriors team up to use their efforts while the only kind doctor tries to bury the bones of Freddy in order to stop his reign of terror.I admit I saw this movie at a young age, and doing so I easily invested a lot into the well rounded group of troubled teens. We have the easily likable Kristen, the uber cool tough Chick Taryn (Jennifer Rubin), the endearing mute guy Joey, the sympathetic chubby girl in hopes of seeking fame, the nerdy (but cool) War craft\/fantasy obsessed Will(who looks like Waldo from Where's Waldo), and the bad ass Kincaid (who more or less spends most of the movie yelling), I'm missing some of the others but you get the idea. Ebert said in his review that he felt the movie gave him no sympathy for the characters and that was its biggest flaw, well I take that in stride. I had no trouble and it actually hurt when some of the kids died. Having that investment surly made the movie a much more personnel viewing. I cared. The movie also runs rampant with SFX, imagination, cool visuals, slick audio and some whacked out death scenes (with a bitter cruel streak). So many of the movies scenes stick out for me, the Freddy snake, the Freddy puppet, the Freddy TV., the Freddy needle scene, the hallway of mirrors, Freddy's basement and boiler room scenes, the Freddy demise. Any video game fanatic would appreciate the action that goes down (dreamers using skills to combat Freddy), and the mythology laid down in this entry certainly is very video game like. The mythology of Freddy is also more sketched out this time as we learn more of his origins and also discover what happens to the souls of the kids he kills (they are trapped in his chest and appear as a tormented screaming face).It seems the more souls Freddy obtains, the stronger he gets. Angelo Badalmenti (Mullholland Drive, Twin Peaks) is the composer this time around brings one of the most unique scores of the entire series. It's quirky and quite pleasing to the ears. I want it. It brings a touch of class to the movie and compliments the imagery quite nicely. The directing is quite inspiring (considering it's his first movie) and he succeeds in balancing the cheesy jokes with the movies menacing sense of hopelessness almost effortlessly. You can tell the makers must have had a blast with this. I know I would have. The movie has a hopeless and nihilistic vibe that makes the jokes more passable. Some flaws that I have to mention is that the warriors aren't never fully able to use their skills towards the end, whether this was time restraints, money, or intentional it's never clear, but it seems they could have had a bigger fight with Freddy, also after Freddy's eventual demise the movie basically ends to quickly, since I was 98% invested with the characters, I wanted to know the outcomes of all the survivors. It didn't happen, making the last frame somewhat tedious. All in all though, I consider this movie to be quite bad ass, and can proudly hold it's head up as not only a worthy sequel, but a highly entertainment movie in general. This is the sequel I show to unfamiliar Elm Street fans, and on that note dare I say we have a classic on our hands? I do.
