He has a master 6th degree black belt in Aikido... and family in the Mafia. He's a cop with an attitude... With this tagline, we show welcome to legendary action star Steven Seagal, who made his debut in this good, high-voltage action film.End of the 80s were a fine period for Seagal to began his movie career, a tall, handsome, dark, with quiet voice and corrugated eyes, BUT... no acting talent what so ever. The director of the film Andrew Davis was probably the only director who could direct Seagal in proper and excellent way, just like Sheldon Letich with Jean Claude Van Damme.First... martial art of Aikido was never presented on screen before, we had Karate, Kung Fu, Tae kwon do, Jujitsu, Kick boxing, Muy thai and some other kick-and-punch fighting styles. You can freely say that thanks to Seagal, Aikido is even more popular than ever. I think in that time, we needed something new and Seagal proved that his Aikido is bad-ass... alltough his movie fighting style is more poke a guy, than the guy attacks him, so that Seagal can perform a tough self-defense technique (Aikido being a primarily a self-defense martial art) and kick his ass. What am I trying to say here... is that Seagal used a more combative style of Aikido. Seagal's tough guy image was also very, very new to us, (without pony tail at first), dark clothes (wow, here he also had white shirt), his Seagalism style of acting, giving us his point of view about the law and other things. That was the boring side of him. That acting of his... well... crossed arms, angry eyes... what kind of acting coach this guy had? Jeez! Story is very solid and classic. There are no some big time miracle action scenes, not some piece of work, it is a fine, classic 80s action and it's good. Acting and fighting scenes are good. Script is fine, altought Seagal put some of his freaking point of view, booooring!!! Other actors Pam Grier (Nico's Parter Jax), she was fine and sexy a first African American partner (even female) to Seagal, Sharon Stone, wow, that was a surprise, as worried, sexy Seagal's wife, Henry Silva, I liked him a lot, the first Steven Seagal villain ever. A perfect choice! Cold, heartless with a creepy goal to kill senator of US.Anyhow, enough of that! This is good action film and enjoy it. Watch it!

Even more bizarrely, they consider it to be the best of the series, and in my mind it's clearly the worst. What is going on? Of course, it's not difficult to see why this film is idolized. The first film was both good and a milestone. Not great, but it was the perfect statement for an age. It was a fairy tale that was confused as science fiction. The Force embodied morality, even religion, for the space age. It is set in the distant past and therefore pertains to origins rather than where technology is going. Spaceships and laser guns are just the backdrop, and have nothing to do with the story or the subject matter. When this film appeared in the middle of the crisis-ridden seventies, it really must have been a beacon of new hope. And to put the ground-breaking special effects into its proper context, they symbolized optimism. There is no doubt that the effects served the story well, but they served even better the mood of the age.

Everybody is straining to do something when there is nothing to do. The third film, The Return of the Jedi, redeems itself by trying to finish a story.

It came out in 1977, 38 years ago, and this film has stood the test of time stronger than a lot of films that came before. It has everything someone looking for cinematic adventure could possibly desire action, drama, humour, and the scope of the universe fully realised in one gorgeous masterpiece.Star Wars established so many tropes that so many other films since its release have tried to copy or emulate, and very few of them if any tend to succeed at capturing the magic of its heart.

Star Wars takes these ingredients and comes out with a result that is wonderfully refreshing for us to behold we are introduced to this new universe that is completely detached from our reality, yet we are right at home within it; a relatable experience that is completely in a fantasy world teaming with characters who are like good friends of ours, an out-of-body spectacle.I can't write everything I want to say about this film in adequate words, but it really is something that is out of this world, and despite ageing somewhat, it hasn't grown old with the times, not really.

To my mind, The Empire Strikes Back from the original trilogy is by far the worst of the six, but it is universally judged to be the best. On the other hand, The Phantom Menace is universally derided, and yet I find it to be the best. It is beautifully scripted; the pace is handled to perfection. The acting all round is superb. The special effects are dazzling, and only gratuitous in the sense that there are too many ugly aliens walking around the periphery. Since this is a problem with all the Star Wars films, TPM should be commended for being restrained, in fact. At least it minimises the ugliness factor by giving the alien characters depth and verisimilitude (utilizing CGI to its limits). Otherwise the effects serve the story very well. Other than the original film, this is the only instalment that never becomes boring and is always engaging.But why does everybody hate it? It was perplexing at first, but then I had another look at the originals and it suddenly dawned on me. One thing we tend to forget is that the original Star Wars films were very ordinary. The hype and the history tend to cloud judgement in this regard. Stars Wars became a phenomenon because it symbolised something vital and crucial for its age. The concept of the Force embodied the morality\/religion of the space age. The ground-breaking special effects imbued optimism in the troubled seventies. A fairy tale was told, and people were caught up in the story. They didn't mind that the acting, writing, direction etc was poor. We pretended that the films were good, and we maintained that pretense for a long time. Then came the Phantom Menace, and this really was a menace. It threatened our hallowed pretences. Here was a top quality film calling itself Star Wars, and next to it the original trilogy looked extremely shoddy. The fans couldn't take the exposure, and thus the knee jerk reaction against the new instalment. That's my theory.It is not just a question of improved special effects. Of course there is that. The effects are so advanced in TPM that those in the original film look distinctly prehistoric in comparison. The advance in science is matched by the cinematography, so that we are treated with a vision that is exponentially more grand in every way. But the fans can always persuade us to ignore technical excellence and focus on artistic excellence. That's what the critics of TPM appear to be doing, only that in the process they get stuck on an intransigent bias. The complaint is that the new film is badly acted, poorly directed, overburdened with special effects, boring, inconsistent, peopled with obnoxious and unappealing characters, and so on. It's one big bias, that's all. The fans feel threatened by the new product, and there is a spontaneous rejection. Whatever they are saying about TPM, I will say that the exact opposite is true. It is not only a triumph of filmmaking; it is also the triumphant realisation of a long cherished vision of George Lucas. The man himself has proclaimed that he does not like the original trilogy, not after he has perfected his vision in the later instalments. His legion of fans begs to differ, preferring the inept filmmaking of the young George Lucas, and the wooden interactions of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fischer and Harrison Ford.Of the host of criticisms leveled by the die-hard fans, only one stands up. Yes, midichlorians is a bad idea, and it virtually trashes the mysticism of the Force. But I can see what persuaded the story writers to it. The Jedi Council must grant discipleship to Annakin Skywalker, and the mystical hunches of Qui-Gon are not acceptable as proof of his suitability. It is a major gaffe, and shows that the Jedi Council itself was wrongly conceived. Lucas should have seen that midichlorians are the antithesis of everything that Star Wars stands for. Maybe there's some truth in the charge that Lucas has sold out, lost the original vision, moved over to the dark side of the Force (i.e. succumbed to commercialism). But there is still enough of that vision left to make TPM a truly memorable film. The pod race is said to go on too long, but I didn't think so. People forget the unending battle sequences in the original trilogy The only other issue I would like to bring up is the ugliness of the aliens. It has become a regular feature for science fiction films to feature ugly aliens, and it points to a chronic dearth of vision among such filmmakers. Stars Wars may have started it all, and it has a lot to answer for in that regard. Why should the beautiful future be marred by ugly aliens? These creatures aren't low-life. In fact in most cases they are superior to humans. The model should have been Spock from Star Trek. His alien-ness is suggested by his pointed ears and that is enough. The rest is left to our imagination and that's how it should be. It comes across through his excessive logicalness, his quizzical reaction to human ways, his posture, his special abilities etc. The aura of alien-ness is very strong with Spock; it's almost non-existent with Jar Jar Binks. Spock was the winning grace of Star Trek. Jar Jar Binks, and indeed all other alien life forms in the Star Wars saga, are merely eyesores and annoyances. An alien is supposed to inspire wonder. What has ugliness got to do with that?

The complaint is that the new film is badly acted, poorly directed, overburdened with special effects, boring, inconsistent, peopled with obnoxious and unappealing characters, and so on. It's one big bias, that's all. The fans feel threatened by the new product, and there is a spontaneous rejection. Whatever they are saying about TPM, I will say that the exact opposite is true. It is not only a triumph of filmmaking; it is also the triumphant realisation of a long cherished vision of George Lucas. The man himself has proclaimed that he does not like the original trilogy, not after he has perfected his vision in the later instalments. His legion of fans begs to differ, preferring the inept filmmaking of the young George Lucas, and the wooden interactions of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fischer and Harrison Ford.Of the host of criticisms leveled by the die-hard fans, only one stands up. Yes, midichlorians is a bad idea, and it virtually trashes the mysticism of the Force. But I can see what persuaded the story writers to it. The Jedi Council must grant discipleship to Annakin Skywalker, and the mystical hunches of Qui-Gon are not acceptable as proof of his suitability. It is a major gaffe, and shows that the Jedi Council itself was wrongly conceived. Lucas should have seen that midichlorians are the antithesis of everything that Star Wars stands for. Maybe there's some truth in the charge that Lucas has sold out, lost the original vision, moved over to the dark side of the Force (i.e. succumbed to commercialism). But there is still enough of that vision left to make TPM a truly memorable film. The pod race is said to go on too long, but I didn't think so. People forget the unending battle sequences in the original trilogy The only other issue I would like to bring up is the ugliness of the aliens. It has become a regular feature for science fiction films to feature ugly aliens, and it points to a chronic dearth of vision among such filmmakers. Stars Wars may have started it all, and it has a lot to answer for in that regard. Why should the beautiful future be marred by ugly aliens? These creatures aren't low-life. In fact in most cases they are superior to humans. The model should have been Spock from Star Trek. His alien-ness is suggested by his pointed ears and that is enough. The rest is left to our imagination and that's how it should be. It comes across through his excessive logicalness, his quizzical reaction to human ways, his posture, his special abilities etc. The aura of alien-ness is very strong with Spock; it's almost non-existent with Jar Jar Binks. Spock was the winning grace of Star Trek. Jar Jar Binks, and indeed all other alien life forms in the Star Wars saga, are merely eyesores and annoyances. An alien is supposed to inspire wonder.

To my mind, The Empire Strikes Back from the original trilogy is by far the worst of the six, but it is universally judged to be the best. On the other hand, The Phantom Menace is universally derided, and yet I find it to be the best. It is beautifully scripted; the pace is handled to perfection. The acting all round is superb. The special effects are dazzling, and only gratuitous in the sense that there are too many ugly aliens walking around the periphery. Since this is a problem with all the Star Wars films, TPM should be commended for being restrained, in fact. At least it minimises the ugliness factor by giving the alien characters depth and verisimilitude (utilizing CGI to its limits). Otherwise the effects serve the story very well. Other than the original film, this is the only instalment that never becomes boring and is always engaging.But why does everybody hate it? It was perplexing at first, but then I had another look at the originals and it suddenly dawned on me. One thing we tend to forget is that the original Star Wars films were very ordinary. The hype and the history tend to cloud judgement in this regard. Stars Wars became a phenomenon because it symbolised something vital and crucial for its age. The concept of the Force embodied the morality\/religion of the space age. The ground-breaking special effects imbued optimism in the troubled seventies. A fairy tale was told, and people were caught up in the story. They didn't mind that the acting, writing, direction etc was poor. We pretended that the films were good, and we maintained that pretense for a long time. Then came the Phantom Menace, and this really was a menace. It threatened our hallowed pretences. Here was a top quality film calling itself Star Wars, and next to it the original trilogy looked extremely shoddy. The fans couldn't take the exposure, and thus the knee jerk reaction against the new instalment. That's my theory.It is not just a question of improved special effects. Of course there is that. The effects are so advanced in TPM that those in the original film look distinctly prehistoric in comparison. The advance in science is matched by the cinematography, so that we are treated with a vision that is exponentially more grand in every way. But the fans can always persuade us to ignore technical excellence and focus on artistic excellence.

Most of the flaws are what we consider bad and there are other flaws that are acceptable per se.We start out the movie with an attack on a guy by some creature in a lake. Most Killer-Crocodile movies are after the gore, killing, and suspense, so this scene would seem predicted.What wasn't predicted was that this movie is not on the same note (or beat) of other killer-crocodile movies. Once you start to get into the thrust of the film you find humor, interesting characters, and a plot that doesn't drive itself into what we consider crappy B-style movies.This film has, what, 2 deaths on-screen? Most Killer-Crocodile moves have at least 5 or so, depending on the situation. This movie is not what I consider a true Killer-Crocodile movie because it doesn't go after the gore and endless, meaningless killing.The first guy in the scuba gear was killed for one purpose to set up viewers for the film. Yes, they were actually setting you up. By the first scene in the film, you could suggest that this was all about the killing, the stupidity, the abomination that a lot of killer-crocodile movies are. Now, that was speaking film-wise. Movie wise, I'm guessing the crocodile had it's daily intake of beavers, but he found something much more appetizing. This concludes that he wasn't killed for nothing. Honestly, Killer Crocodiles must have at least 80 stomachs to hold as much food as they do in a lot of films I see now days. This film was realistic in the deaths--the croc got FULL!The second guy, the deputy, he was holding a beacon that had BABY CROC SOUNDS coming out of it. The crocodile was doing it's motherly\/fatherly duty by protecting the itteh bitteh babiez. He wasn't killed meaninglessly. It was one of the best death kill I've seen in any Killer-Croc movie. Why? Because even though you didn't actually SEE the crocodile, you saw PART OF IT. For an instance you saw the shadow, the black-mass come up and bite off that dude's head!This movie is not on the same beat other Killer-Crocodile movies are. This movie wasn't a horror film even, considering it does feature a crocodile that kills. This movie provided laughs, a good time, and it can be serious when it wants. Now, not that an actual crocodile could get into that lake, but there are reports every day of a crocodilian getting into lakes, rivers, etc by people putting them there. I knew of a breeder where I was living (Florida) released a 2-year-old Crocodile that was mistreated (LOTS OF DRUGS!) into a lake. There was actual DEATHS because of the creature! Now, doesn't that sound like the plot of a very B-Rated movie? Then real-life is it's own B-Rated movie because that actually happened! All across the world Alligators and Crocodiles are released into natural habitats and people can be injured.This movie served it's purpose. It's one of the BEST crocodile movies I've ever seen, especially with it's reality factor.I'm going to comment on the sequels as well. Lake Placid 2 and Lake Placid 3 didn't even HAPPEN in my book. If I ever make it into the movie business, I'm going to make my own sequel and bring back the original characters. The SyFy channel ruins so many darn series it sickens me.

I've yet to find an intelligent, knowledgeable moviegoer or critic who would slam its production values, because they are undeniably keen under Lynch's mastery. What has sparked such a firestorm is the movie's explicit and sometimes appalling content, both ostensibly and symbolically. The key example was the long-running dispute between Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. There is no right or wrong answer to any movie in terms of whether it is good or bad, a masterpiece or a clunk o' junk, but there seems to be little consensus about Blue Velvet.As the movie opens up, it turns out that the hospitalization of the father of our lead character (Kyle MacLachlan) is merely the plot's excuse to bring him to an open field, where he discovers a severed human ear. After bringing his discovery to the authorities, MacLachlan and the daughter of a detective (a very young Laura Dern) embark on a personal mission. When a trail of assumptions leads them to a night club singer (Isabella Rossellini) whose husband and son have disappeared, MacLachlan discovers that the nice little town he grew up in is not such a paradise after all. That there is a sick and perverted underworld to it, personified and imbued with evil by a perverted drug addict.The villain is played by the late Dennis Hopper in what may be the greatest performance that magnificent towering figure of acting talent ever gave. Hopper's character Frank Booth is one of the most sickening, repulsive, and unpleasant characters ever put on screen. Whereas Norman Bates was frightening, yet somehow sympathetic, you condemn this narcotic-addicted monster from the very beginning. And it is his character and the way he sexually and psychologically imprisons the Isabella Rossellini character that is a key symbol about society and human beings in the picture.David Lynch's Blue Velvet is, once examined psychically, much more than a horror story or even a satire. It is a rich and traumatizing accurate analysis of what we have come to labeled as civilization. It opens up with a pleasant, heart-warming sight of a nice little town and then embarks you on a nightmarish journey, discovering some of the most unpleasant and revolting character relationships as well as some sweet and charming ones as well. Lynch is not being entirely nihilistic in Blue Velvet; he is just showing us both sides of the coin. However, like an F can be more significant on a report card than an A+, he leaves more impact with the bad sides of his view even though he will have to reward us eventually. At least we assume that he must.But what I found most compelling about Blue Velvet, still days later after seeing it for the first time and holding it in my mind for so long, is the network of relationships between the characters. In particular, the relationship between Kyle MacLachlan and Isabella Rossellini is one of the more heart-warming and transfixing, if odd, friendships ever put on camera. It commences with some riveting setups that would have made Alfred Hitchcock nod in approval, and then, as he might have done so with this material, warps it into something rather beautiful and unique. There is also a very strong chemistry between MacLachlan and Laura Dern and that has plenty of power to develop the sense of being lost and confused in our protagonist. Some might consider the picture misogynic for the way that Isabella Rossellini's character is seemingly brutalized and humiliated toward the end of the picture, but I don't see that as the case. Sure, she is a victim, but more of a victim, I think, of society's way of tolerating scum like Frank Booth.Blue Velvet is also a great film because it has the same effect on a lot of people as it did to me it makes you think. It makes you ponder about what it means and what the director David Lynch was trying to point out and force upon us. And like any work that takes that approach, the interpretations will be insurmountable. I can fully understand the harsh negative reactions that have been thrown upon this picture over the years, but I cannot help but side with the opposing view that it is really some kind of a masterpiece.

In particular, the relationship between Kyle MacLachlan and Isabella Rossellini is one of the more heart-warming and transfixing, if odd, friendships ever put on camera. It commences with some riveting setups that would have made Alfred Hitchcock nod in approval, and then, as he might have done so with this material, warps it into something rather beautiful and unique. There is also a very strong chemistry between MacLachlan and Laura Dern and that has plenty of power to develop the sense of being lost and confused in our protagonist. Some might consider the picture misogynic for the way that Isabella Rossellini's character is seemingly brutalized and humiliated toward the end of the picture, but I don't see that as the case. Sure, she is a victim, but more of a victim, I think, of society's way of tolerating scum like Frank Booth.Blue Velvet is also a great film because it has the same effect on a lot of people as it did to me it makes you think. It makes you ponder about what it means and what the director David Lynch was trying to point out and force upon us. And like any work that takes that approach, the interpretations will be insurmountable. I can fully understand the harsh negative reactions that have been thrown upon this picture over the years, but I cannot help but side with the opposing view that it is really some kind of a masterpiece. There has not been much of an in-between reaction to Blue Velvet and the newcomers to it like myself are very much in the same battle. You will either love it or you will hate it...and for the exact same reasons.

You put Citizen Kane at one end, slip the Magnificent Ambersons in the middle and finish the line off with Touch of Evil. That's a short but very amazing collection and except for one error that just looks worse and worse as time goes on, Touch of Evil definitely deserves its place of honor.The story starts with a bomb going off in a town on the U.S.\/Mexico border, killing a prominent American and his stripteasing companion. The case is investigated by Captain Quinlan (Orson Welles), the local police legend, and Miguel Vargas (Charlton Heston), a law enforcement official with the Mexican government who is in town with his beautiful American wife Suzy (Janet Leigh). Vargas is an upstanding straight arrow, preparing to testify in a case against the Grande crime family on drug charges in Mexico City. Quinlan is a fat, seedy, honking, hateful lump of a man, but one who demands respect for his tremendous record as a cop. Quinlan settles on a young Mexican for the bombing, believing his relationship with the victim's daughter is all the proof he needs. Vargas questions Quinlan's methods, especially after he suspects the cop of planting incriminating evidence against the young man. As Vargas and Quinlan face off, Suzy comes under the threat of the Grande crime family, who plan on using her in a scheme to either scare off or discredit Vargas before he can testify against them. But as Vargas' relentless investigation into Quinlan's actions pushes the fat man over the edge, no one's plans turn out anything like they hoped.The first thing about Touch of Evil is that it is one of the best looking movies you'll ever watch. It is in black and white and often dominated by shadow, but almost every single moment of the film is visually stunning. If you've only seen Citizen Kane, you might doubt that Welles could ever top it, but that is what he does with the images of Touch of Evil. Welles' use of extended tracking shots, especially at the beginning of the movie when the camera first follows the car with a bomb in it and then shifts to focus on Vargas and Suzy walking down the same street is still a marvel today. If you care at all about the way movies look, you have to see this film.The acting is also quite good, with one exception I'll get to in a bit. Janet Leigh does a great job early in the film as Suzy defiantly stands up to the Grande crime family, then shows Suzy later on as a woman being worn down by the extended tension and pressure of her situation. Joseph Calleia seems to be doing an ordinary job as Lieutenant Menses, Quinlan's adoring sidekick, but when Menses realizes the truth of his hero's nature, Calleia gives some real emotional depth to that disillusionment. And Welles creates one of the great unfinished characters in Quinlan. Not only does Welles let you see the changes going on in Quinlan while we're watching him, but he gives you a sense of all the changes that happened to Quinlan in the past to bring him to this point.The writing is also very strong. I'd guess most would rank it below Citizen Kane, and I suppose I would to. But while Kane was essentially a very simple story told in a complex fashion, Touch of Evil is a very complex story that Welles' is trying to tell in a very simple fashion. The script grapples with racism, primitive emotions, police corruption, border politics, Mexican cultural insecurity and the difference between simply bad and truly evil.For all its greatness, however, there's a huge, flashing neon sign of a problem with this movie. Charlton Heston plays a Mexican. The other actors playing Mexican roles are all either clearly of Hispanic heritage or speak with noticeable accents. Heston doesn't have the slightest trace of an accent and just looks like a white man who's been baked in the oven too long. He's glaringly ridiculous to the point where you just have to pretend his character isn't actually Mexican to keep enjoying the film.If you can make that sort of switch in your own head, Touch of Evil is one of those must see movies as the last genuinely great work from one of American cinema's true geniuses.

In fact I think that if I called it that this movie has the best dialogue ever in a film I wouldn't get a lot if any backlash. The characters after seeing them one time I already feel like I have seen them a million times how memorable the characters are. The people who play the characters are just wonderful, and would like to thank them all. It just unbelievable what I got out of this movie. In my opinion it works well as both a comedy and a drama. I love every moment of it.4 stars out of 4 ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"17 October 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" When I decided to watch this movie for the first time today I thought that it was going to much like a Monty Python film.

Godzilla himself is a product of nuclear testing, a prehistoric monster that was mutated by the radiation of bomb tests and goes on a rampage throughout Tokyo. This movie presents Godzilla as a destructive force of nature, a violent beast that destroys everything in its path. Despite being merely an actor in a rubber suit, Godzilla looks very good, particularly for the time it was filmed. Obviously, the highlight of the film is the all the scenes with Godzilla, but the human characters here are sympathetic and interesting, particularly the tormented Dr. Serizawa, creator of the one thing that could potentially defeat Godzilla. The film is dark and eerie in tone, and it carries a very heavy message with it. Overall, it's an entertaining and thought-provoking monster movie and despite it's slow pace, it's still everything you could want from it. It is definitely a classic, and of course it introduced the world to Godzilla, the real King of the Monsters.
