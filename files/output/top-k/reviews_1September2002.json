I felt they really promoted the heck out of this movie, building it up like they did with Unbreakable, which in my opinion wasn't really that suspenseful of a movie but they were trying to ride the success of The Sixth Sense, and who wouldn't I guess. Anyway, I digress. Don't See It Alone was really the icing on the cake for me. That little tag line was like a magnet pulling me into the theater.Jackpot! M. Night Shyamalan has to be one of the most promising filmmakers of my time. Of course, my favorite genre is Horror\/Suspense\/Thriller so you can understand why I enjoy his work so much. With this movie he remembers the key to making a good scary movie music, suspense and the ever elusive leaving things to the movie goers' imagination. He knows just what NOT to show to keep us on the edge of our seats, biting our nails. Plus he knows how to add humor to make you relax just enough to scare you even more in the next scene. You feel safe while you're laughing and he knows how to get you when you're feeling safe.I enjoyed the plot, the characters, and the overall film. The only complaint I would have (if I had to have one) is that Shyamalan messed up where a lot of other filmmakers mess up in a scary movie by showing a little too much. However, I am still extremely pleased with the movie and can't wait for Shyamalan to take me on my next ride of suspenseful intrigue and fear. Scary movies now stand a chance of being good again.

NL never had glory, just one moderately funny, severely overrated college flick. That said, VAN WILDER is the ANIMAL HOUSE for the new generation. It's always a pleasure to start a movie expecting one thing and being rewarded in every way.  I expected VAN WILDER to be disgusting, oversexed, and full of hormone-charged, none-too-bright teenagers drinking, smoking, screwing and getting high.  That's what I got.  But to tell the truth, I enjoyed the hell out of VAN WILDER.  Why?  I don't know.  But I think it has a lot to do with Ryan Reynolds. Apparently, he'sfrom the ABC sitcom TWO GUYS AND A GIRL, but I wouldn't know because I've never seen it, and I can't really imagine Reynolds in any other role than Van Wilder.  He has a great, easy charm about him.  As soon as you see him, you like him and want to be him.  So, the filmmakers succeeded in that way.I have complaints, though.  The foundation of the alleged plot is so shaky you'd think it was being held up by Jello shooters.  I get the distinct feeling that the MPAA cut a great deal from the final version to make it R-rated, because the film seems like the editors attacked it with a carving knife.  I was also upset by the horrible frat-boy archnemesis.  He made my skin crawl, he was so annoying.  In addition, the pastry scene reminded me too much of that scene in TOMCATS where David Ogden Stiers ate Jake Busey's cancerous testicle.  There's bad taste, and then there's dog-masterbatingly, cum-guzzlingly bad taste.  Draw a line, fellas. However, I can't deny that when VAN WILDER ended, I was smiling.  It made me want to leave the sanctity of my dorm room and throw one bitching party. I guess that was the point all along.

But instead of using the development of the protagonist as a theme, Shyamalan chooses to tell the story about an alien invasion and how its affects the protagonist and his faith. If you look hard you may find some submotiv about if events are accidential or destiny (as in Unbreakable).Even more surprising is how weak the visual construction of the movie is. Despite some stunning compositions, especially in the early stages, Tak Fujimoto's skill seems wasted. The compositions are flat and at certain points almost banal.The story itself takes alot for granted without informing the audience of it, but worse, it has elements which are so coinsidential that they belong in a bad b-movie. For instance, the only bookstore in town has one book about aliens and that book is perhaps the most insightfull book ever written, since it predicts everything which the aliens later do. Another example is when Gibson encounters the alien, locked up by Shyamalan, who for some reason knows they dont like water, he basicly leaves it be and doesnt call the police. Signs has many coinsidences which function as nothing but a temporary suspence\/scare motiv.Overall a extremely weak movie, which has none of the originality that Six Sense and especially Unbreakable had.

To some vocal fans, KHAN is a total violation of what STAR TREK is about, what with its paramilitary atmosphere, its use of revenge as a plot point, and the horrific violence caused by said revenge. Gene Roddenberry's rejection of the film on those same grounds has only intensified the debate between those who hold the film as a desecration of the mythos  and those who regard it as the definitive entry in the saga. Up until a few years ago, I probably would have sided with the naysayers, simply because the violence in the film upset me as a kid. I was 4 when the film came out, and I thought it was the goriest movie ever made. But then I grew up, realized that there've been far bloodier films, and gave KHAN another chance. When I finally saw it again when I was a teenager, I realized that I actually liked the film a lot&#133;and that its violence was actually pretty mild compared to most movies.As written and directed by Nicholas Meyer (the screenplay by Jack Sowards credit is a misnomer), the film goes like this Jim Kirk is now a desk-bound admiral suffering a mid-life crisis while the Enterprise is now being turned over to a team of cadets. Unfortunately for him, Khan Noonien Singh, a genetically-enhanced maniac he marooned 15 years ago, has hijacked a Federation starship and is about to (a) steal a terraforming project called Genesis that could be used as a weapon and (b) go after Kirk in a suicidal revenge campaign. (The garden planet Kirk marooned Khan on was ravaged by a cosmic disaster that turned it into a barren desert, and Khan's wife and many of his followers were killed as a result of the devastation.) Once the scientists working on the terraforming project-among them Kirk's son and his mother-are threatened by Khan, Kirk takes command of the Enterprise and proceeds to investigate the matter. Much to Kirk's surprise, Khan is waiting for him, and a series of harrowing encounters ensues, resulting in the controversial death of Spock.The plot is pretty simple, but this works to the film's advantage. Meyer's script (from a story by Sowards and producer Harve Bennett) is tightly constructed, moving at a swift pace and not wasting a moment on useless details. Even though the film deals with such heady matters as old age and death (an unwinnable test scenario called the Kobeyashi Maru becomes a motif that brackets the film), it still finds time for gentle verbal humor and wordplay. Unlike the first film, which felt uncertain at times, KHAN is confident and relaxed with the characters. The core cast is much more at ease this time out, and their performances are all the better for it. William Shatner especially is at his best in this film; this talented actor finally drops the hammy shtick that has become the target for mockery (or self-mockery, as is the case with Shatner's  recent work) and delivers a subtle, easy performance that hints at what might have been had he not given in to camping it up. Bibi Besch and Merritt Butrick (both of whom have passed on) are engaging as Kirk's estranged family (the death of Kirk's son in the third film is all the more regrettable for this), and Paul Winfield, as the brainwashed captain whose ship is swiped by Khan, is suitably tragic. There's also Kirstie Alley making her debut as Saavik, Spock's protégée. But let's not kid ourselves; this is Ricardo Montalban's movie all the way. Cool yet insane, murderous yet elegantly charming, Montalban makes Khan one of the most intriguing villains in film history. And despite Khan's limited screen time, Montalban makes the character an imposing presence that dominates the film. Aided by James Horner's bombastic pirate movie-esque score and some of ILM's most dynamic FX work ever (barring one stiff matte painting in the Genesis cave), the film generates an energized feel and mood that refuses to let up until the story has run its course.Which brings me to the accusations made by those who claim this film trashes Roddenberry's vision. Too paramilitary? Sorry, Roddenberry had always said that STAR TREK was a high-tech Horatio Hornblower saga, and the original series had military underpinnings. Violence has no place in TREK? Then please explain why the original series was saturated in deaths and near-deaths, why everyone in a red tunic got iced in almost every episode, and why every last one of the crew members was constantly getting into brawls. Revenge is not a theme that fits what TREK is all about? Excuse me, but I thought STAR TREK was essentially about the human condition, and the nastier, darker aspects of humanity are a part of that condition. To ignore them would be to whitewash humanity and do TREK a disservice. This film is no grimmer than the classic episode Wolf in the Fold, about Jack the Ripper's soul possessing people in order to carry on his killing spree. Really, KHAN doesn't do anything that wasn't already done on the series. As for Roddenberry's gripes about the film&#133;well, it's been established that he became a control freak whose grip on STAR TREK nearly paralyzed it creatively.

The thing is packed with incredible shots and perspectives, some of them familiar from the work of others and some like nothing I've ever seen before.  The shot with the nuns is just one that leaps to mind.  In fact, some of the camera and editing techniques are the kind that you see in TV ads, when the producer is pulling out all the stops to catch your attention.  It's definite fodder for those in film school, but it all kind of blurred together in my eyes after a while.  Maybe it was too much.  Maybe I just got tired after all of that stridency.  The fact is that I've never had any use for MTV - the fact of its existence or the incredibly annoying stylistic hallmarks, like jerky camera movement and a succession of rapid cuts, that have always been integral to its broadcasts.  And this is a film steeped in the MTV sensibility.  Maybe post-MTV...whatever.I began to suspect that this was not going to be a straight narrative when the cartoon Lola kicked in as she ran down the stairs and out of her home.  Actually, the cartoon - changing each time, albeit quite subtly - is very fitting given that this whole movie has the look and feel of a video game.  Methinks the producers and directors must've spent a lot of time playing such games, because it's apparent to me in everything from the cartoon sequence to her running around to pick up things that may be of use to the fact that she was given three &#145;lives' during which to reach her goal.  I don't know about you, but I'd love to have the ability to do three re-takes of various situations within my life.  That was a nice little twist, and the film is executed skillfully enough that the three different versions of reality each seem fresh and new.  Trying to keep it so, yet retain temporal continuity, must have been a challenge.  Then again, perhaps it wasn't all that much different than compiling the various takes normally required for any film, the only difference being that each take featured different dialog and action.  Regardless, the whole was flawlessly executed.  I definitely get the feeling that the postproduction staff pored over every frame of film at length, completing the vision that must have been firmly established during principal photography.  Interesting use of DV in some places, too, to contrast the mood with that filmed on film stock.  The use of What a Difference A Day Makes in one of the alternate-reality sequences was particularly effective, too, and a nice break from the overbearing &#145;techno' core.In some ways this movie's all about action and less so involved with character.  In particular, Lola's character is too busy running around to take the time to develop before us.  Then again, Franka Potente was so good that we could sense much of her nature without anything overt being revealed, and the elements that comprise her life can be glimpsed in interactions with her father and others.  And she can scream loudly, too.In some ways this film irritated me.  I'm not entirely sure why.  Sure, those rapidly-cut explorations of the various futures of ancillary characters were interesting and kinda cool, but they also seemed to distract and detract from the film.  To some extent I wasn't totally sympathetic with the characters, though Lola was basically appealing and I felt her anguish and rising panic.  I was disappointed in the ending, actually - if I were Lola, I'd have decked that SOB Manni.  On the bright side, Ms Potente must've really been in good shape by the time they finished filming this thing.  I do really get into the big-effects-from-small-causes thing, too, because the truth of such things never fails to amaze me.  And there's within a film a core conflict that's also explored in Forrest Gump - fate versus chance.  Deterministic versus stochastic.The bottom line for me is that it's a technically brilliant film, beautifully filmed, ingeniously plotted and twisted, and expertly acted...but it never really struck much of a chord with me where it really matters.  I think it was great but it's never going to make it to my considerable list of favorite films, and certainly not among the ranks of films that I could watch over and over again.  Maybe it was just too highly stylized.  Maybe I'm destined to forever remain immune to the charms of &#145;art films.'  Oh well...I'll always have Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

In fact, some of the camera and editing techniques are the kind that you see in TV ads, when the producer is pulling out all the stops to catch your attention.  It's definite fodder for those in film school, but it all kind of blurred together in my eyes after a while.  Maybe it was too much.  Maybe I just got tired after all of that stridency.  The fact is that I've never had any use for MTV - the fact of its existence or the incredibly annoying stylistic hallmarks, like jerky camera movement and a succession of rapid cuts, that have always been integral to its broadcasts.  And this is a film steeped in the MTV sensibility.  Maybe post-MTV...whatever.I began to suspect that this was not going to be a straight narrative when the cartoon Lola kicked in as she ran down the stairs and out of her home.  Actually, the cartoon - changing each time, albeit quite subtly - is very fitting given that this whole movie has the look and feel of a video game.  Methinks the producers and directors must've spent a lot of time playing such games, because it's apparent to me in everything from the cartoon sequence to her running around to pick up things that may be of use to the fact that she was given three &#145;lives' during which to reach her goal.  I don't know about you, but I'd love to have the ability to do three re-takes of various situations within my life.  That was a nice little twist, and the film is executed skillfully enough that the three different versions of reality each seem fresh and new.  Trying to keep it so, yet retain temporal continuity, must have been a challenge.  Then again, perhaps it wasn't all that much different than compiling the various takes normally required for any film, the only difference being that each take featured different dialog and action.  Regardless, the whole was flawlessly executed.  I definitely get the feeling that the postproduction staff pored over every frame of film at length, completing the vision that must have been firmly established during principal photography.  Interesting use of DV in some places, too, to contrast the mood with that filmed on film stock.  The use of What a Difference A Day Makes in one of the alternate-reality sequences was particularly effective, too, and a nice break from the overbearing &#145;techno' core.In some ways this movie's all about action and less so involved with character.  In particular, Lola's character is too busy running around to take the time to develop before us.  Then again, Franka Potente was so good that we could sense much of her nature without anything overt being revealed, and the elements that comprise her life can be glimpsed in interactions with her father and others.  And she can scream loudly, too.In some ways this film irritated me.  I'm not entirely sure why.  Sure, those rapidly-cut explorations of the various futures of ancillary characters were interesting and kinda cool, but they also seemed to distract and detract from the film.  To some extent I wasn't totally sympathetic with the characters, though Lola was basically appealing and I felt her anguish and rising panic.  I was disappointed in the ending, actually - if I were Lola, I'd have decked that SOB Manni.  On the bright side, Ms Potente must've really been in good shape by the time they finished filming this thing.  I do really get into the big-effects-from-small-causes thing, too, because the truth of such things never fails to amaze me.

Even as an adolescent myself, I can't relate to the young lovers torn apart by 'feuding fathers', who are really just pretending to do so, in order to arrange the marriage of their children. It's a cute concept, and it's very lost here. After hearing the original cast recording of this musical, I can understand why some reviewers here have said The Fantasticks was butchered on screen. With just a harp and a piano, there's the sort of nostalgic charm that Try To Remember creates when used as the opening number.  That's lost somewhat in the movie version, which leaves the 'first act' rather lifeless and idiotic; Jean Louisa Kelly is surprisingly bad, Joe McIntyre is totally unlikeable, and I have no love of any of the songs performed.  Even Joel Grey, who I loved in Cabaret, is unenjoyable. After 'This Plum Is Too Ripe', the story picks up somewhat.  There's more of a focus on El Gallo, the very mysterious and very charming carnival master who orchestrates the 'abduction' that brings the lovers together in the first half of the movie.  While he was a welcome spark of life in the boring first half, even he was subdued there as compared to the second part of the story, where he charms Kelly's character and seduces McIntyre into the bright lights of the sideshow in order to teach them both some valuable lessons. You could say that maybe I haven't learned what Louisa learns in the film, about the seductive effect of illusions and where it really leads you, but I can completely understand why she finds El Gallo wonderful, even as the tents of the sideshow are crumpling and lightning is striking at a snap of his fingers.  He's both captivating and cynical, a welcome bit of charm and life, and I would have welcomed the bigger role I've heard he has in the original stage show as the narrator throughout.  I'm surprised there aren't a thousand shrines to this wonderful performance, not to mention a cult of El Gallo fangirls. Only from his 'real' swordfight with McIntyre's character Matt onward did I become interested in this movie, but once I was hooked, it was addictive. The simple but wonderful monologue that begins 'There is a curious paradox...' nearly set me crying; I can't think of a single person who can't relate somehow to those words.  Even with my lack of love for the teenage leads, I enjoyed them finding each other again through my appreciation of that message. But to everyone who wants to see The Fantasticks buy the DVD version; some of the best scenes were cut, as well as The Rape Song, which was one of the few songs I genuinely enjoyed.

The movie just so happens to be an artistic advancement over Snow White, the movie of which the Disney artists initiated their most expensive animation techniques at the time. Pinocchio is partially known as the film of which they successfully mastered the multi-plane camera filming, which gives the background art breathtaking strokes of realism.Pinocchio has much more than beautiful artwork. It also has creative writing (borrowed respectively from the original novel), great character development, fresh humor, wonderful music, and emotional impact.Every character, ranging from Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket to Stromboli, the Coachman, and Monstro, has helped make this a milestone in American filmography. I like Pinocchio, because his innocence is used instead of ignorance as the cause for his downfall in both incidents (first with Stromboli, and later with his trip to Pleasure Island). This personifies how many bad things we might do in life are derived from our GOOD intentions, instead of bad. But my favorite character would have to be Jiminy Cricket, who's probably the smartest character in this whole presentation.The story itself is so emotionally compelling, one would wonder if Carlo Collodi used the Bible for a little inspiration. A lot of what we see in Pinocchio would seem like it. The protagonist (Pinocchio) is brought to life upon his dad's (Geppetto) wish, but must prove himself a good person before he can become a real boy. The one who witnesses his coming-to-life (Jiminy Cricket) is appointed his conscience by the life-bearer (The Blue Fairy). Pinoke is tempted to do bad, what seems good at the time (by Honest John, Gideon, Stromboli, and the Coachman), and befriends one who is eventually condemned from following the wrong path (Lampwick). Pinoke narrowly escapes from being completely condemned, and has to use his mind to save his father from the beast (Monstro). Along with Figaro & Cleo as supporting players, this storyline goes on and on bringing joy where there's joy, grief where there's grief, fear where there's fear, and so on, to the point of stimulating the notion that Pinocchio is a morality tale derived from the Bible. We may never know for sure.Walt Disney has conquered the art of retelling classic novels more than twice, and here he especially succeeds with flying colors. Pinocchio went on to win 2 Academy Awards following its 1940 debut, and several other states of recognition as recently as the mid-1990's. This is also one of the many pieces of evidence proving how wonderful Walt was (despite scorn from cynics, serious critics and fun-hating intellectuals).Pinocchio truly is a milestone, not just in American animation, but American filmography in general. But beware the current Disney Studio has been churning out terrible sequels to vintage animated films. They already got Peter Pan, Cinderella, and Lady and the Tramp, and more are due in the near future. We must make sure that Disney doesn't destroy this movie. As I said in my Sleeping Beauty review, some people just don't know when to LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE. Again, Pinocchio is a masterpiece that has touched the hearts of the past few generations, and will continue to do the same for many future generations.

The movie just so happens to be an artistic advancement over Snow White, the movie of which the Disney artists initiated their most expensive animation techniques at the time. Pinocchio is partially known as the film of which they successfully mastered the multi-plane camera filming, which gives the background art breathtaking strokes of realism.Pinocchio has much more than beautiful artwork. It also has creative writing (borrowed respectively from the original novel), great character development, fresh humor, wonderful music, and emotional impact.Every character, ranging from Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket to Stromboli, the Coachman, and Monstro, has helped make this a milestone in American filmography. I like Pinocchio, because his innocence is used instead of ignorance as the cause for his downfall in both incidents (first with Stromboli, and later with his trip to Pleasure Island). This personifies how many bad things we might do in life are derived from our GOOD intentions, instead of bad. But my favorite character would have to be Jiminy Cricket, who's probably the smartest character in this whole presentation.The story itself is so emotionally compelling, one would wonder if Carlo Collodi used the Bible for a little inspiration. A lot of what we see in Pinocchio would seem like it. The protagonist (Pinocchio) is brought to life upon his dad's (Geppetto) wish, but must prove himself a good person before he can become a real boy. The one who witnesses his coming-to-life (Jiminy Cricket) is appointed his conscience by the life-bearer (The Blue Fairy). Pinoke is tempted to do bad, what seems good at the time (by Honest John, Gideon, Stromboli, and the Coachman), and befriends one who is eventually condemned from following the wrong path (Lampwick). Pinoke narrowly escapes from being completely condemned, and has to use his mind to save his father from the beast (Monstro). Along with Figaro & Cleo as supporting players, this storyline goes on and on bringing joy where there's joy, grief where there's grief, fear where there's fear, and so on, to the point of stimulating the notion that Pinocchio is a morality tale derived from the Bible. We may never know for sure.Walt Disney has conquered the art of retelling classic novels more than twice, and here he especially succeeds with flying colors. Pinocchio went on to win 2 Academy Awards following its 1940 debut, and several other states of recognition as recently as the mid-1990's. This is also one of the many pieces of evidence proving how wonderful Walt was (despite scorn from cynics, serious critics and fun-hating intellectuals).Pinocchio truly is a milestone, not just in American animation, but American filmography in general. But beware the current Disney Studio has been churning out terrible sequels to vintage animated films. They already got Peter Pan, Cinderella, and Lady and the Tramp, and more are due in the near future. We must make sure that Disney doesn't destroy this movie. As I said in my Sleeping Beauty review, some people just don't know when to LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE. Again, Pinocchio is a masterpiece that has touched the hearts of the past few generations, and will continue to do the same for many future generations.

I was extremely pleased. I felt the plot was pretty good, typical of most spy flicks but felt it was rushed at some points and jumped around a lot. I enjoyed the actors' characters and felt they all did a good job portraying them. However, the writing seemed to be lacking something. Some of the humorous lines weren't funny and a bit over used, in my opinion, if another actor had portrayed X some of the lines would not have went over at all. I felt Vin played this character very well and it was very believable to watch him in many of the movie's action scenes. I didn't feel overwhelmed by computer generated action either which was nice. Most of the stunts\/scenes are quite believable.I think most people will enjoy this movie as long as they go in expecting an action flick, not some thought-provoking, deeply moving film. It's not the best movie ever made but it can definitely hang with the big boys of the Bond series and spy genre. I feel this is a good performance from Vin (he keeps getting better and better) and I can't wait for his next film, Knockaround Guys.

While it was not worst movie I have ever seen, it certainly is not even close to the best or even what I would call good enough to be watched a second time.  There is no plot or conflict and there isn't much in the way of character development and the movie is extremely, extremely, predictable.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few mildly funny parts in this movie, but then again it is not targeted at the 18-25 year old market.  If you are a member of an older generation and if you have close contact with a greek or ethinc family you will probably enjoy this movie, but as for me, I'll pass on it.P.S. John Corbett, GET A GOD DAMN HAIRCUT!!!!

Okay, I just got done watching this movie because I had read other reviews on this site. What to say? First off, this movie should *NOT* be taken seriously, although I don't see how you could! Secondly, I do not think DeadAlive (or Braindead, whatever you want to call it) was scarey AT ALL. It was a total cheese-fest. I will say, however, that I thought it was funny as *insert explicative*. I am a fan of horror, and I guess you HAVE to say it was a horror flick because of the zombies, or were they zombies? I laughed through the whole thing, and wondered, where is this going? There is basically no plot, but it works well because all the movie tries to do is gross the heck out of you. The custard part, of all things, was actually the part where I felt like I could hurl. The lawnmower part was just absolutely hilarious. I don't think I've ever seen more blood on my television set EVER. I liked it for this reason. I disliked it because I like my horror to be actually scarey. There was no suspense, and the characters just didn't act like REAL people. The people who made this film did this on purpose. So to sum it up, if you want something serious skip this. If you want to invite some friends over, drink some beers, and laugh your head off, then this is the one for you. I hope this helped, it is just very hard to explain this movie, you just have to see it.***** of ***** if you take it as a comedy. 0     of ***** if you take it as a serious horror.
