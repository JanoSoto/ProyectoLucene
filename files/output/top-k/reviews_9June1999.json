The film is not misleading or confusing; it's simply very badly structured and the ending predictable and unsatisfying. It doesn't challenge the intellect; rather it insults it.I've seen a lot of Cronenberg's earlier work and at times this seems like a pastiche, when I had expected considerably better things of him.The themes of technology, reality versus fantasy and the loss of identity are rich for exploration in film (perhaps the most efficient warping of reality), and the subject of many a paranoia, but they have not been well served by this film.Dark City was dark and twisted but that managed not to alienate and irritate its audience. Even The Truman Show managed a better stab at the topic than our Canadian auteur. For a better consideration of these themes then I would suggest consulting the works of Philip K.

This flick is the rarest of all birds - a movie that combines revolutionary special effects and the most incredible action sequences ever shot on film, with a strong plot about humanity's dependence on machines becoming reversed, the nature of reality, and the need for rebellion.The Matrix's strength above all is its refusal to talk down to its audience - it assumes you know a little about technology and\/or philosophy before you walk in the door.  It is the thinking man's action movie - one that pulls you into a world remarkably like our own, then peels it back, layer after layer, showing you the world of the Matrix.The special effects are fantastic, both in their execution and their restraint - they are used only to undercut the intensity of one scene, or to showcase the otherworldly nature of the three main stars.Speaking of which, the stars of the show do their jobs exceedingly well. Laurence Fishburne plays the role of Morpheus with a type of detached calm, as one would expect from someone whom knows that what they see isn't real.

To me, it appeared as a Kid's TV spin-off from the orginal Star Wars films. Alternatively, a 2 hour intro to a PlayStation game. It was basically an animated film, and in that respect, I felt it looked less visually impressive than certainly episodes V\/VI. CGI can be an effective tool, but must be used sparingly. James Camerom recognised this with Titanic by using real models, as large as possible, to create a degree of realism. Like PM, those parts of Titanic that fail are the brief sections that use straight CGI. The mind is not fooled; instead, the mind thinks it is seeing a painting (which it is). The sense of depth and chaos expressed by the fight scene in Return of the Jedi easily outweighed the pastel Fx of PM. But Fx are just one aspect. The story was p.poor. Hardly the start of a Saga. Why can't George L escape American Apple Pie? Why does Anakin have to be a cute kid? Why couldn't he be a little s*d who shows signs of being bad? I have read that the British actors involved in the film were most disconcerted during the acting phase, since most of the time they were stuck in front of a blue screen. I love film music and by and large John Williams turns out a good score - occasionaly pappy if in the hands of a Spielberg film - but usually quite bold and striking. The score here, which seemed to be mainly choral work, was very lack-lustre. The highlight for me was spotting Ralph Brown (alias Danny the drug-dealer from Withnail & I) as the space-craft pilot.

I watched Sam Raimi's A Simple Plan 2 days later, and for me, that film was infinitely better than Star Wars. George Lucas grow up, look around the American Pie country you live in and realise that it's not all suburbia and zit-free. We can handle something nasty.

And I don't think Grant has played the same the same character over and over again(there's not much in common between his roles in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, SIRENS, and EXTREME MEASURES, for example, not to mention AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE).  But he certainly does a carbon copy of his performance in FOUR WEDDINGS here. Worse, while he was able to display a range of emotions in that film, and even get in on some of the film's funny bits(the best man speech), here, the only emotion he's allowed to display is wistfulness, and a little of that goes a long way.  You just wish that he'd get angry once.Julia Roberts fares a little better, though she's underplaying as if she expected she'd have something much more raucous to play against.  She of course is playing someone who has to have a facade on at all times, but she does get to show other facets, like petulance(when the others around her are saying how miserable their lives are, and she feels left out), humor(when she shows up a group of diners talking about her as if she was a whore), and anger(when the press shows up outside Grant's door).

But I am a committed fan (in the sense of being devoted, not insane), and I feel the need at least to declare publicly my admiration for Lucas' latest work, and also a few of my concerns.Overall, Episode One ranks above Episode Six, about par with Episode Four, but certainly nowhere near the grandeur and wit of Episode Five. Phantom Menace reminds me of something someone said of Citizen Kane A hollow masterpiece. PM is technically brilliant, yet it is so technically brilliant that it lacks a certain human warmth.  To me, the best moments were those intimate, interpersonal moments--Padme giving Anakin a blanket, Qui-Gon placing his hands on Anakin's shoulders in the Jedi temple, and ESPECIALLY all those moments with Shmi Skywalker, Anakin's mother.In an interview in Premiere Magazine, Liam Neeson gave a telling anecdote that illustrates my point. First, he noted that Lucas was reticent to give the actors any motivation for lines, expressions, or anything.  In other words, Lucas simply expected the actors to say lines devoid of emotional content, as if the post-production could somehow invest emotional motivation. Neeson revealed that it took him a long time to convince Lucas to allow Qui-Gon to place a hand on Shmi's shoulder after he convinces her to allow him to take Anakin away to Coruscant. That hand on the shoulder was probably the BEST moment in that film, a sign of human connection in a swirling clash of galactic politics gone awry.Traces of post-production fiddling is evidenced most forcefully with Jake Lloyd's Anakin. Watch carefully his scenes at the dinner table, sitting with Qui-Gon at night, and saying goodbye to his mother. Those scenes were clearly doctored in post-production; I believe Lucas took different takes of Lloyd saying lines and splicing those with Pernilla August's. Pay special attention to Anakin after Shmi says, He can help you, he was meant to help you. Anakin's face is clearly digitally manipulated to turn sideways. The first time I noticed it (it was the fourth time I've seen the film) I was taken aback. It was so blatant I began to wonder what other bits were modified that way.On the plus side Lucas can weave a wonderfully rich narrative tapestry. I love that all this begins with a trade dispute. A trade dispute! Complete with procedural wranglings in a galactic senate rife with corruption and bureaucracy (watch for the cameo appearance of Spielberg's ETs) and a sinister Darth Sidious pulling the political strings. It's the perfect smokescreen to disguise the rise of an evil empire. Every step of the plot has the look of careful craftsmanship; every twist and turn of the plot had relevance.The costumes are outstanding, especially Queen Amidala's Asian-influenced wardrobe.  John Williams has certainly outdone himself with the soundtrack, particularly Duel of the Fates, which introduces choral voices into the Star Wars musical repertoire, ominous voices that sometimes hiss and sometimes howl the forboding Sanskrit text. The production design and cinematography (both real and CGI) create vistas of unparalleled beauty and richness from the Italianate arches and domes on Naboo, to the art nouveau-inspired underwater air-globes of the Gungans, to the dramatic cityscapes of Coruscant. I can see Academy Awards next year for all these achievements . . .Despite its many drawbacks, I am drawn continually to rewatch The Phantom Menace for its artistry, for its lines (There's always a bigger fish), for those rare human moments, and to soak in this latest addition to the Star Wars text.

It is disguised simply as a film about an apparent nut who goes out and tries to right the wrongs that have been done to him and in his trek across Los Angeles he becomes an anti-hero. While that may be true to an extent, read more into it and you can see a film that tries to show us that there is something terribly wrong with how we live. I wasn't alive in the 50's, in fact, I was born in the 70's. So I can't honestly tell you if life was easier back then. But what I can tell you is that times were a bit more simple then. For the most part, you had one income in the household. You had T.V and radio as your entertainment and kids went outside to play. Now you must have both parents working so you can have that double income. Kids are obsessed with the internet and videogames and so on. What does all of this have to with the film? Everything!Falling Down is about the decay in one man's life and how it affects not only him but those around him. There is one very powerful scene in the film that can sum up everything.There is a key moment in Falling Down that is sad in it's reality, but true in it's opinion. Douglas is in a surplus store and the guy running it is a Nazi sympathizer. When Douglass doesn't share his opinions, they get into a confrontation. The guy snaps and tells Douglas to spread against the wall. He obliges and then the Nazi guy wants to handcuff him. He tells Douglas to give him his hand, he does. Then he tells Douglas to give him his other hand. Douglas is supporting himself on the wall in a 30 degree angle and if he gives the guy his other hand  he'll fall down.  Which is precisely what he tells the Nazi guy. This is a microcosm of the film and a microcosm of what may be wrong with not only society but people in general. There is a theory in wrestling that your arms and legs are like a table, if you take out any two of the legs or arms, your opponent falls down and is vulnerable. Same thing with a human being. Take away so many of his limbs ( job, wife, dignity, credit rating, kids, etc. ) and it may be only a matter of time before that person does snap. This movie shows us what happens to one individual that does snap. He wasn't all that bad to begin with, but as time went on and he was  lied  to, he can't handle it and finally one day, he has had enough. I think this film is more important than people realize and if you have only seen it once, see it again. You may see something that you didn't see before. Hats off to Schumacher and Douglas who had the guts to make this film.

It's the thing that will have me going back to see it again, and maybe again.....and have me recommending it to everyone I see. It's the thing that has you coming home from the film happy,  going to bed happy, and still thinking about it in the morning - and you're still happy.

I was extremely disappointed with the film.  First, though, there were certain elements of the film that I thought were good 1. I thought that Danny Aiello's performance stood out as extremely good. Of all the characters, he was the one with the most depth, I thought. 2.  Spike Lee has a very strong aesthetic sense.  Visually, the film was very interesting a lot of the time.  I do think that he could have done more with the motif of extreme heat throughout the middle third of the movie.3.  Lee represents ambiguity well in places--for instance, he shows that despite certain racist elements ingrained in him, Sal\/Aiello is not a bad person.  Of course, I think he romanticizes the character of Sal in parts.4.  The scenes that did not have any dialogue (I'm especially referring to the riot scene) were very powerful.  Lee builds suspense and interest extremely effectively.Which brings me to my list of complaints.... 1.  I thought Spike Lee's performance was atrocious, often comically bad. I think he should have skipped trying to be a complete auteur for the film and let someone more qualified play his role.  The final scene with Danny Aiello is one of the best-written scenes in the movie, but Lee nearly ruins it with a wooden reading of his lines. 2.  Much of the dialogue was extremely awkwardly constructed.  Reading his journals, I had extremely high hopes for intelligent screenwriting, but I was really disappointed.  I understand that Lee was trying to make many points about violence and about race, but I thought that he resorted to speechifying rather than assuming very much intelligence from his audience. By tacking on speeches about race relations, he missed a good opportunity to incorporate them more effectively into conversations.3.  Having Spike Lee's character of Mookie throw the trash can through the window of the pizzeria (by the way, did anyone else find it odd that they spelled it pizzaria?) was a mistake, I think.  It would have been far more plausible and more satisfying if someone else had commenced the riot. Spike Lee could have gotten his point across much more effectively had his character simply not done anything. 4.  The film seems extremely dated, to the point where something that may have been comical in 1988 is simply not funny, whereas other elements that were not intended to be humorous have become amusing.  This isn't something that I can necessarily fault Lee for, but it was rather distracting as I was watching it. 5.  I just don't think that the writing is intelligent enough to do justice to Spike Lee's very important ideas about the topics addressed in Do the Right Thing.What worries me, however, is that my problems with this film stem from the fact that I, as a white male, might never fully understand Spike Lee's perspective on racial issues.

Francois Girard has directed and written (with Don McKellar) a beautiful drama detailing the life of a red violin from its manufacture in the late 17th century through its sale at an auction in the present.Samuel L. Jackson portrays Charles Morritz, an antique violin authenticator. This auction is the framing device for the rest of the film. The tale flashes back to the tale of Nicolo Bussotti, a fictional violin maker. He is planning to give it to his unborn child. His pregnant wife (Irene Grazioli) goes to an old woman fortune teller who proceeds to relate some of the future of the Bussotis and other owners of the instrument.The violin continues on through the years coming into the possession of an orphan (Christoph Koncz). It then is owned by a virtuoso soloist (Jason Flemyng) who gets his inspiration by playing it during love-making with the lovely Greta Scacchi. The instrument passes across the ocean to China where Xiang Pei (Sylvia Chang) is caught in the middle of the cultural revolution. Finally, as a valuable antique, it is brought up for auction in the film's final sequence.This cursory summary cannot do justice to the lush beauty of this film. Joshua Bell plays the violin on the soundtrack to a fine score by John Corigliano (CD on Sony Classical). At an early screening Bell explain that the children in the orphanage are actually violinists. Bell's hands are also shown in other scenes as the instrument is played. The movie cost only $9 million but the production has an epic feel to it. McKellar explained that this is accomplished by lavishing the expense on one elaborate scene in each vignette. It definitely works.Girard has fashioned a wonderful story that probably should have been saved for the fall season. It has award winner written all over it. Especially in the areas of costumes, scenic design and music. It's a feast for the eyes and ears.

Jackson portrays Charles Morritz, an antique violin authenticator. This auction is the framing device for the rest of the film. The tale flashes back to the tale of Nicolo Bussotti, a fictional violin maker. He is planning to give it to his unborn child. His pregnant wife (Irene Grazioli) goes to an old woman fortune teller who proceeds to relate some of the future of the Bussotis and other owners of the instrument.The violin continues on through the years coming into the possession of an orphan (Christoph Koncz). It then is owned by a virtuoso soloist (Jason Flemyng) who gets his inspiration by playing it during love-making with the lovely Greta Scacchi. The instrument passes across the ocean to China where Xiang Pei (Sylvia Chang) is caught in the middle of the cultural revolution. Finally, as a valuable antique, it is brought up for auction in the film's final sequence.This cursory summary cannot do justice to the lush beauty of this film. Joshua Bell plays the violin on the soundtrack to a fine score by John Corigliano (CD on Sony Classical). At an early screening Bell explain that the children in the orphanage are actually violinists. Bell's hands are also shown in other scenes as the instrument is played. The movie cost only $9 million but the production has an epic feel to it. McKellar explained that this is accomplished by lavishing the expense on one elaborate scene in each vignette. It definitely works.Girard has fashioned a wonderful story that probably should have been saved for the fall season. It has award winner written all over it. Especially in the areas of costumes, scenic design and music. It's a feast for the eyes and ears.

However, I was really taken with it. It grew on me having caught my attention with an excellent mix of picture and music right at the start of the film when a car is pushed over a ravine edge. There were lots of interesting sequences to catch the imagination, coupled with a lovely lot of older music tracks - I especially liked the Elvis Presley track, even though I am not a rabid fan of his.  Ridley Scott touches were much in evidence.  It was something a bit different and the actors were all very good in their parts, particularly Joaquin Phoenix and Vince Vaughan.  Having been impressed with Joaquin Phoenix in another film watched recently - A Return to Paradise - I shall be watching out for him from now on.There were definitely touches of Hannibal Lector in 'Lester the Molester' one of the main characters.A thoroughly good watch.....

Sure, some people love the original so much it's hard to let go.  I am a huge fan of remake films, as long as they're true to the original.  For example, I enjoyed Tom Savini's 1990 remake of Night of the Living Dead more than the original, and I also liked the 1992 version of Dracula better than any previous effort.  It's not that the originals weren't good films, but I was more entertained watching the more modern versions.  Some films, I agree should not be touched, such as The Exorcist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Films as powerful as those could not possibly be improved, let alone matched in a more modern portrayal. Psycho is a film that can be redone in every decade, as it truly tests the passage of time in its magnificence.  I do like the original, and I believe it is a classic.  However, I appreciate what Gus Van Sant has done for us horror fans, and I would never condemn it because it didn't live up to SOME people's expectations.  I don't have anyone else think for me, I suggest you watch it and make up your own mind. ","genre":null},{"date":"9 June 1999","score":"","review":"  I must admit that I did enjoy this remake.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"9 June 1999","score":"8 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":"  Everyone that sees this movie has to chuckle at all of the characters. Take a bunch of ignorant porn stars who forget what they are there for, to make smut, and they all end up taking themselves way too seriously as actors. For example when Dirk started thinking he was the second coming of bond as Brock Landers and when Buck, the black porn star went to the bank to get a loan and called himself an actor to the loan officer. Also notice how Dirk was practicing his lines in the first porn scene as if the lines really mattered anyway. I also noticed how much Amber wanted to be a mother figure having lost her real children in a custody battle. She first turns to Dirk, Dirk then leaves and she takes Rollergirl as her child. The coke scene Where Rollergirl states to Amber, Amber will you be my mom?The most brilliant scenes were when Dirk was in the recording studio trying to do some Loverboy rip-off act and the drug scene gone bad at the end die you puppies!!!!!!!. What amazes me is that these actors were able to all act as ignorant as they appeared in the film.Everything works out at the end though and Jack Horner ends up being the good guy taking everyone back who helped him in the beginning. Even though they were virtual losers in every other aspects of their lives, although outcasts maybe a better description. An example of Jack Horner's charity the next time you watch the film, is when Jack allows Buck to install a stereo hi-fi system even though Jack doesn't show much interest in the hi-fi system. Jack Horner at the end of the film if you notice, becomes some type of paternal figure to all of these people taking them all back in as though hey are some tight knit family.9 out of 10>  ","genre":null},{"date":"9 June 1999","score":"8 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":"  Everyone that sees this movie has to chuckle at all of the characters.
