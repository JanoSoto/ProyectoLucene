Both stories are about the imagination of monsters living in children's closets, but these monsters aren't dangerous, they are harmful and friendly.  Where in Wild Things Are the monsters enjoy the company and playtime with the main child character, Max. MONSTERS INC.  the monsters are actually terrified by the presence of a child or anything that is human for that matter.  In fact, the monsters are more afraid of the children than the children are of them, nice irony. MONSTERS INC. is about two power plant factory workers in the city of Monsteroplois, James P. Sulley Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal).  Sulley is the number one monster frightner for the factory, as Mike is Sulley's loyal assistant, roommate, and friend. The monsters have assign doors placed in front of them which leads them to the closets of real world into children's bedrooms so they can scare the children. The monsters of the city need the screams a child gives when they see a monster, that is how they get their energy.  The film even does a witty sub-plot to the real-life California rolling blackout energy crisis.  Sulley is admired by his co-workers and his boss Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), while Mike has a flirting romance with the company secretary, Celia (Jennifer Tilly). Everybody likes the winning duo except for the jealous Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) a chameleon-like monster who adapts his skin to his surroundings so he can hide. Randall has been putting in unofficial scare hours so he can be the top monster at Monsters Inc. It's when Sulley accidently opens up one of Randall's closet doors to find a small girl, who Sulley calls Boo has enter into the monster world.  There is a eariler scene that is horrifying realistic in today's time when a child's sock is stuck to a monster and the decontamination a monster goes through for his and everyone else's protection.  With Boo in the monster world, things can be catastrophic. Sulley and Mike try to hide Boo (even dressing her up like a monster) as they look through the billions of closet doors, to find the right one to her bedroom, as Randall wants Boo for a diabolical scheme that he plans to use her for.  But it when Sulley and Mike try to help Boo find her way home, that they begin to both feel like parents and want to help and protect the infant child. After getting a sour taste of this year's computer animated films (yes I'm talking about SHREK), MONSTERS INC. proves that Pixar and Disney animation is a winning combination and shouldn't be competed with.  Where SHREK was full of potty jokes and mugging the camera, MONSTERS actually tells a story that has a lot of depth and meaning behind it.  SHREK wanted to do cut-down jokes (especially to Disney films), MONSTERS INC. instead takes a different path and does jokes about life in general and the monster's lives are similar to our own. I found MONSTERS INC. to be another winner from Pixar, who are so far 4 to 1 on my scoreboard for successful computer animated films (only Dreamworks SHREK being the only point for the other team).  If people are asking themselves, gee there's SHREK, FINAL FANTASY, and JIMMY NEUTRON, how can MONSTERS INC. be any better?  Well that's simple, it's like saying how is a ride at Disneyland better than a ride at a carnival.  Where a lot of film studios and companies are adapting to computer animated films, Disney always manages to stay a few steps ahead of it's competitor's.  First, look at the millions of hairs that cover the wooly Sulley, the scenes when he runs you can see the hairs gently move from the breeze.  Second, the human child of Boo looks more realistic than any of the generic humans in SHREK. Third, there is much more color with the Pixar films, I figured this out when ANTZ and A BUG'S LIFE were released three years ago.  Finally, the messages and morals behind the Pixar\/Disney films are more original, where MONSTERS tells the viewer that don't judge a book by it's cover, that the most terrifying looking things can be the most caring.  And that it's difficult to be a parent but with teamwork and care, it can work!  Where SHREK is doing the things aren't what they seem moral which Disney did 60 years ago with DUMBO, and DUMBO was much more cuter, charming, and more touching than a obnoxious loud orge. It doesn't surprise me that MONSTERS INC. was directed by former SIMPSONS producer David Silverman, and Pixar veteran Peter Docter.  Disney had some competition this year for computer animated films, while Dreamworks had a royal flush, Disney won by having the royal flush straight, and should win the Oscar for best Animated film this year.

Three headed dogs and trolls - acceptable selections for CGI but the craft of computer generated imagery has not reached the stage of portraying realistic human performers and we get a digital Harry quite a few times flying at breakneck speed on his Nimbus 2000. It may be my point of view - being all too aware of digital effects - but these tricks didn't detract too much though there were a few Quidditch moves that looked more like SHREK than flesh and blood.Enough. There is no real trouble with HARRY so a nod of appreciated to Columbus, Kloves and Warners not to mention the person who oversaw production like, well, like an owl. Joanna Kathleen Rowling. Bravo J.K. Book 5 please.

(As a counter example, I *can* groove to, say, the imagery in Blade Runner, and enjoy watching the film just for that, even though I don't find the story to be particularly interesting or well told.)

And `Heist,' the latest offering written and directed by Mamet is no exception.  This one involves a crew of criminals led by Joe Moore (Gene Hackman), doing a thing, yes a thing, don't you see, yes, don't you see, they have to do this thing for this other criminal named Bergman (Danny DeVito) before they'll get their cut of the last thing they did for him.  And so it goes for Joe and his crew, Bobby Blane (Delroy Lindo), Pinky (Ricky Jay) and his wife, Fran (Rebecca Pidgeon), as well as Jimmy Silk (Sam Rockwell), Bergman's man, whom he insists must be included with Joe's crew for the latest `thing,' or robbery.  The heist of the title.  It's the reason they're all here, and it's the reason, yes, don't you see, it's the reason the audience is here, too.\tAnyone familiar with Mamet will appreciate-- or at least understand-- the opening paragraph of this review; and by the same token, those same people will probably be somewhat disappointed with this film, because though it is pure Mamet, it is sub-par Mamet.  The problems begin with the casting, or more precisely, the miscasting of the project.  I never thought I'd feel that Gene Hackman didn't belong in a film, but in this case I do.  Not that he did a bad job here-- I don't think Hackman has ever done a `bad' job in anything-- but he didn't do a `Mamet' job.  And neither did Danny DeVito.  Both outstanding actors and craftsman, without question, but neither did justice to the material in this one, which certainly has nothing to do with their respective abilities and talents.  \tMamet has perfected a certain style which has everything to do with the way his actors deliver their lines, something of a Mamet trademark `clipped' delivery that Hackman and DeVito simply did not seem to grasp.  It's a way of presenting Mamet's material that in his previous films has been perfected by the likes of Joe Mantegna, William H. Macy, Campbell Scott and Lindsay Crouse.  Here, only Rebecca Pidgeon and Ricky Jay managed to deliver it effectively; otherwise it was missing.  And it made a tremendous difference to the overall success of this film.  On the surface, it may seem like a small thing, but without that particular style of speaking-- of presenting the dialogue-- the usual tension and suspense that Mamet manages to build and sustain throughout a film was sorely lacking.  Another factor may be that the plot of this one was not as intricate or involved as that of `House of Games' or `The Spanish Prisoner,' both of which kept you on the edge of your seat until the very end.  This story is a bit more straightforward, and as such was perhaps simply not conducive to that magic Mamet touch that accounted for the success of his previous films.  Not that this is a bad film-- it's not-- it's just that it could've been so much more, which is what fans of Mamet, especially, have come to expect.  \tAs previously stated, Hackman gives a solid performance here, but it's simply not the kind of presentation that was needed to bring this story to life.  And the same goes for DeVito; a good job, but just not right for this material.  Delroy Lindo seemed to fall into that same No Man's Land, as well.  Just as certain actors-- even great actors-- cannot do a Woody Allen film justice (Kenneth Branagh in `Celebrity,' for instance), not all actors are cut out to do Mamet.  Performance-wise, the only saving grace of this film is Rebecca Pidgeon (Mamet's wife in real life), whose presence alone is mesmerizing.  The bottom line is, she knows how to do `Mamet;' she knows, yes, she certainly knows, don't you see, how to put his material across.  And watching her do it is a study in perfection.  As she demonstrated in `The Spanish Prisoner' and again in `State and Main,' she can single-handedly take a Mamet project to a higher notch on the scale.  Unfortunately, as good as she is here, it's not enough to raise the bar to a more satisfying level.  Her performance alone, however, makes this film worth seeing.\tThe supporting cast includes Patti LuPone (as Betty Croft-- a thankless role for an actor of her stature, and one that leads you to believe that most of her work here must have ended up on the cutting room floor), Karen Cliche (Alex), Christopher Kaldor (Laszlo), Andreas Apergis (Trooper) and Tony Calabretta (Coffeeman).  Not every film can be a gem, especially when the director has guts enough to take a chance and go outside the box in an attempt to keep his material fresh and new, which is exactly what Mamet tried with `Heist,' beginning with his cast.  And you can't fault Mamet; there's not a director around who wouldn't take a chance on Hackman for any project, and with good reason.  And, again, this IS a decent film-- it's just not that `classic' Mamet, and looking at it from another perspective, if every director's `misfire' was as good as this, there wouldn't be any `bad' films at all.  In the final analysis, Mamet fans are going to want to see this one, and everyone else should give it a look, as well, because it is entertaining, and for most will undoubtedly be a satisfying cinematic experience.  Because, in the end, it's still all a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7\/10.

There is an expression in the movies--suspension of disbelief. That means that if a movie is done right, you allow yourself to believe that James Bond or Darth Vader, Animal House or Silverado, E.T. or Jaws, Casablanca or even Shrek have or are real characters that act in ways that are believable and so we allow ourselves to become voyeurs with a front row seat to the action. A Clockwork Orange takes you on an emotional rollercoaster from anger, to lust, to disgust, to hatred, to curiosity, to empathy, to pity. Heist just made we want my money, not to mention my two hours, back. There are a lot of low budget rip-offs and a few big budget ones. Heist is obviously a low budget movie that spent all of its money on talent, got no scriptwriter and ran out of ideas before it got started. The only reason that I gave this movie any points at all is because of an explosion or two. And you know how much that appeals to men.Gene Hackman is great. He creates a believable character who is a career criminal. And he wants to quit, but Danny DeVito (who seems more like Louie in Taxi and may possibly be in his worst role ever) wants him to do one last heist--the Swiss thing. His wife, played by Rebecca Pidgeon, has little emotion, and apparently her entire act is to appear to be Sharon Stone. Delroy Lindo is trying to be Samuel L.

My first thought was, Oh if only it could be that simple.After viewing it post-9\/11, I felt the movie was giving the viewer a couple of instructive messages 1) When directly confronting a terrorist attack, we have to risk the possibility that innocent people will be killed in our efforts to stop the attack from succeeding (it addresses this indirectly), 2) In the fight against terrorism, we must be careful that we do not lose our American soul--our principle that those among us who are not endangering anyone else should be free to live their lives.  Though I never got Agent Hubbard's theory that martial law is just what the terrorists want.

He adores Toy Story 2 and Tarzan, and can watch them (and has) repeatedly.

I first heard about it after buying the Tigger Movie DVD for my son. It seemed quite brilliant at the time, what little I gleaned from the all too brief trailer. I won't ruin the plot for you, but it is basically Toy Story with different characters. Instead of toys that secretly lead a life away from their owners, we now have monsters that are thought of as figments of the child's imaginings. They survive off the screams of children and around the clock they sneak through children's closet, and scare the bejeezus out of them.

Which is also why I have always loved this movie so much. The only thing that stops me from naming Being There as my favorite movie -- ever -- is that I consider it impossible to name any one movie as my favorite movie -- ever. I mean, can one say that Being There is better than The Wizard of Oz, Citizen Kane, The Bridge on the River Kwai, North by Northwest or any one of dozens of other classic movies? I cannot, no matter how much I love it. But it is in the same class as all of those classic movies and that's good enough. For me.Being There was the first of The Big Three of demi-recent idiot-savant movies, the other two being Rain Man and Forrest Gump. It is also the least popular of the three, the least well-received by movie critics and the least recognized for its achievements in terms of awards. All of which phases me not in the least. When a moviegoer truly believes in and loves a movie, nothing can sway that cine-o-phile from his or her belief and love. And that's how it is with Being There and mineself.I guess what I like most about Being There is the multitude of subtle nuances in the plot. Oh, sure. The acting is great. How could it not be with Peter Sellers, Shirley MacLaine and Melvyn Douglas, not to mention the strong supporting cast? But don't forget! In order for actors to have a chance to be great, they have to be given characters that are great to play, as well as meaningful things to say and do. And in this movie, the characters are given all of that by novelist-screenwriter Jerzy Kosinski.It would be very easy to say this is Peter Sellers' movie, since everything and everyone in it revolve around him. He's the person, after all, who morphs from Chance, the ever simple-minded gardener, into Chauncey Gardner, deep thinker on all matters of great import. But if the other actors were unable to play off of the Chance\/Chauncey character in any or some meaningful way, then there would be no movie. Being There could never have been a one-man movie. That's why Melvyn Douglas won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of the dying Ben Rand. And as good as Peter Sellers is in the main role, it is, surprisingly, Shirley MacLaine who wins my heart among the three stars.She plays Eve Rand, Ben's wife, and the person who first discovers Chance. In her own way, she's as guileless as Chance himself. She's the first person to perform the makeover on Chance, converting him to Chauncey. The rest of the cast just runs with it from there. But in every single scene in which she appears in this movie, without exception, she is warm, tender and loving. Loving of her dying husband -- AND -- of Chance. Er, Chauncey. Every time I watch this movie, I'm ALWAYS hoping for, rooting for, Eve and Chauncey to fall in love, even though I know it would be impossible for the hopelessly empty mind of Chauncey to ever love any woman. And their big love scene is as good as it's ever going to get for Eve, even though she doesn't know that. Her performance of a certain act for Chauncey simply because he likes to watch (it's TV that he likes to watch, but she thinks he's referring to something else), is one for the ages. It is scenes like that which make Ms. MacLaine SO LOVABLE in this movie.All in all, Being There sums up my philosophy of life. Just ..... being there.

In her own way, she's as guileless as Chance himself. She's the first person to perform the makeover on Chance, converting him to Chauncey. The rest of the cast just runs with it from there. But in every single scene in which she appears in this movie, without exception, she is warm, tender and loving. Loving of her dying husband -- AND -- of Chance. Er, Chauncey. Every time I watch this movie, I'm ALWAYS hoping for, rooting for, Eve and Chauncey to fall in love, even though I know it would be impossible for the hopelessly empty mind of Chauncey to ever love any woman. And their big love scene is as good as it's ever going to get for Eve, even though she doesn't know that. Her performance of a certain act for Chauncey simply because he likes to watch (it's TV that he likes to watch, but she thinks he's referring to something else), is one for the ages. It is scenes like that which make Ms. MacLaine SO LOVABLE in this movie.All in all, Being There sums up my philosophy of life. Just ..... being there. And every time I watch Being There, I absolutely LOVE ..... being there.

His team includes Dillon(Carl Weathers), Mac(Bill Duke), Blaine(Jesse Ventura), Billy(Sonny Landham), Poncho(Richard Chavez) and Hawkins(Shane Black).  They go in and encounter their enemies but soon discover something more terrifying the Predator.This is one of my favorite Schwarzenegger films to come out during the 1980's.  The action is tight and director John McTiernan's direction is slick.  The Oscar nominated special effects are cool.  One should take into consideration about the violence in this movie.  The violence hear is quite gory, yet hardly of the supergraphic kind.  The skinless bodies of two men are found hanging from a tree, a man's arm is blown off, another man has a hole the size of a basketball blown into his chest, and another man's brains are blown out.  Last, but not least, a lot of praise should go to the towering, late Kevin Peter Hall for his excellent portrayal of the Predator; the silent, invisible hunter from another planet.  He literally has all kinds of weapons up his sleave which include a shoulder blaster, a blade, and a powerful self-destruct weapon.  Kevin Peter Hall returned to do the highly underrated sequel Predator 2 with Danny Glover and Gary Busey.  10\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"10 November 2001","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Dutch(Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team of commandoes go off into the South American jungle to rescue some hostages.

Stamp plays the cockney hardman very well, and I was so surprised that Soderbergh didn't exploit stereotypes, particularly Stamp's character. The most he did was used a bit of cockney rhyming slang, but not too much. Fonda was good but I find his smile irratating (?). Am I alone there? I agree with the review which said that the film rewards patience, not much happens for the first half an hour. And the viewer, throughout the film, gets repeated flashbacks and flashes of future scenes in about 2-3 second doses. The film's violent content only really kicks in for the second half and isn't as gratuitous as it sounds. My favorite part is when the gangsters, about a quarter into the film, drag him out of their warehouse and kick and beat him outside. Then, they say all this typical stuff like  If you show you're face around here again- you're a dead man! English fag! Then they walk back in. What does he do? He pulls himself up, bleeding and bruised, reaches into the back of his belt and pulls out his pistol and walks straight back inside...
