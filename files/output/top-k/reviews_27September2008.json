[{"date":"27 September 2008","score":"","review":" This was a very successful effort from DreamWorks Animation when it was released in 2001. I didn't go to see it in theatres, and don't think I knew about it until late in 2001, after it came into stores. I remember around then being asked it I had seen the movie, but the answer was no, I think until shortly before Christmas that year. When that happened, I remember I was not disappointed. I'm not sure whether I saw the entire thing from start to finish between then and this year, but I did so a couple nights ago (I know that was the first time in quite a while), and I don't think I liked it quite as much as before, but I think it came close.Shrek is a green hermit ogre and who lives peacefully in a swamp, and is generally feared by others in the land. However, one day, he meets a talking donkey in the forest who is running from captivity, and unintentionally saves him. After this, Donkey, who has no friends, begins to follow Shrek back to his swamp, and the ogre has finally met someone who isn't afraid of him, though the chatterbox donkey will find that Shrek is very unfriendly. That night, Donkey has to sleep outside, and Shrek soon finds that his swamp is crowded with fairy tale characters! He tells them to leave, but learns that they can't! They have been banished by the evil Lord Farquaad, and have no other place to go! So, Shrek sets out with Donkey to talk to Farquaad and get his swamp back. Farquaad wants to become a king, and plans to marry Princess Fiona, who is trapped in a dragon's castle, surrounded by lava, waiting for her true love, so he makes a deal with Shrek. If the ogre rescues Princess Fiona for him, his swamp will be back the way it was. Shrek immediately accepts, and sets out with Donkey to the dragon's castle, determined to get his swamp back, but on the way back with the princess, unexpected things happen! The last two DreamWorks Animation efforts I watched prior to watching this one again were Shark Tale (which I had seen before), and Madagascar. Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy, is sometimes funny, but his chattering can sometimes be a bit much, with lines such as, And then one time I ate some rotten berries. Man, there were some strong gases seepin' outta my butt that day! I may not have found the character as amusing as I did before, but the parts where he gets on Shrek's nerves tend to be good for laughs. Shrek, with a voice provided by Mike Myers, can also add to the humour, such as around the beginning with the way he suddenly appears in the presence of a bunch of hunters, talks to them about ogres, and scares them off, and other scenes where he shows his anger. The film does have some gross-out gags, including much of the opening sequence, and Shrek pulling earwax out of his ear to use for a candle. I didn't care much for those, but fortunately, there aren't too many of them. Aside from the humour, there are also some moments of excitement, including Shrek, Donkey, and Princess Fiona running from the dragon and trying to get back across the bridge over the lava! There are also some deep, maybe touching moments, such as Shrek telling Donkey why people look at him the way they do, and the struggling romance. Last but not least, unsurprisingly, this 2001 animated feature has great 3-D animation, something I can usually say about these CGI animated films. This effort from DreamWorks Animation isn't exactly one of the greatest animated movies I've ever seen, but it still has its charm, that's for sure, and I can see why it was so successful. I was a teenager (fifteen years old) when I first saw it, not long after it was first released on video, so I obviously don't know what it's like to see it as a kid. However, it seems the movie has been enjoyed by kids and adults alike, so I guess it's one of those movies. Many people have seen Shrek in the past seven years, and it seems it hasn't been forgotten, not that it deserves to be. If you still haven't seen it, but a rather humorous, clever, well-written animated feature, parodying numerous fairy tales, sounds like something that's right up your alley, and you don't mind a bit of crudeness and toilet humour, then I see no reason why you shouldn't watch Shrek the next time you get the chance, since it hasn't failed to please most people who have seen it, it seems.

I mean, it was only by occasion that I had a chance to watch it and, even though I had not the foggiest idea of what was the movie about, I decided to watch it because I was in the mood of seeing something different. I knew this was an animated movie, but I didn't know it was a combination of live-action and animation. That was a big surprise when I started watching the movie. But even before that I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits because there was a list of famous actors, such as the legendary and unforgettable Macaulay Culkin, Cristopher Lloyd, Whoopi Goldberg and Patrick Stewart. I was delighted because it stars the great Macaulay Culkin.The story introduces Richard Tyler (portrayed by Macaulay Culkin), an intellectual boy obsessed and concerned about statistics of nearly everything. He lives with his parents but seems to be a lonely boy with practically no friends. That and his obsession for statistics worries his parents. When he goes to a library, he meets an eccentric librarian, Mr. Dewey (played by Cristopher Lloyd), who believes Richard is desperate for a book about a fantasy world with adventure, danger, darkness, dragons and so on. After that, Richard sees a spectacular roof painted with strange characters and fantastic creatures. Then he accidentally slips on some water and falls down unconscious. What's next? Well, Richard and everything around him is transformed into illustrations. Richard lives great dangers and adventures in a world of fantasy and horror, including being swallowed by a enormous fire-breathing dragon.The movie starts very well and (I've gotta admit this) it has some spectacular and very creative special effects in the library. Next, the movie becomes animated, but not for good. While the animation is good, I can't say the same about the rest. The designs\/drawings, sceneries, picture quality and artwork in general are nothing but dreadful. That fantasy world is a horrible place. The animated characters themselves are, most of them, very ugly. The illustrated Richard looks good and similar to Macaulay Culkin and the giant dragon looks absolutely amazing, but the rest of the characters are too much and annoying, especially those animated books Adventure (a pirate-like book), Fantasy (a fairy-tale shaped book) and Horror (a horrific-looking book). Through great part of the movie, I found similarities and common elements to other movies and stories. Where do I begin? The tree-house idea comes from Home Alone. The fact that Macaulay Culkin wears glasses here is a similarity to his character from My Girl. A treasure island and the one-legged pirate Long John Silver comes directly from Treasure Island. There are also elements from Peter Pan and Moby Dick. But that's not all common elements with Jack and the Beanstalk, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, The Black Cauldron, Sleeping Beauty, Ghost Busters and even with Asian anime cartoons are another reality. Some similarities with The NeverEnding Story can be found either. In the fantasy world, Richard is sent to a quest to face his fears. Another good example is the fact that he goes to a library (in this case, in the live-action world) and meets an eccentric librarian who tells him about strange and fantastic stories. Another similarity is that Richard gets angry in the end, for all they made him been through.Back to real life and the live-action world, Richard is still unconscious but when he wakes up, he seems to become a stronger boy and more ready to face life's problems.A good movie? Definitely not for me. Like I said, it starts very well and promising, but turns out to be a major disappointment when it becomes animated. Its combination of so many stories doesn't work well and its artwork is really terrible. The movie is also extremely dark, like The Black Cauldron and The Lord of the Rings, for example, which doesn't help either. Overall, a good movie for kids, but for adults I'm not so sure. It all depends on each person's tastes.At least Macaulay Culkin deserves credit for his performance. He might have messed up his life later, but he always proved to be an excellent actor.

The damage done to him, didn't looked that serious.As a child, i liked the movie mainly for the effects and robots, but the more i grew up, the more my perception of this movie widened itself and yet there was a shock to come. About ten years later i bought the criterion DVD of Robocop and still i knew nothing, also i had seen Starship Troopers and knew as well as had seen about Verhovens, let's say addiction to movie violence and extreme gore, but still...Nana nanana, nana nanana! Boom! And off Murphys hand flew, i felt like someone had kicked me in the stomach with full throttle, i truly felt like witnessing an accident or violent crime. I will not give away the full horror of Murphys death, but i have to say, i am not a wuss when it comes to movie violence, but this scene repeated itself in my head as well as willing and unwilling for the next two weeks! The unedited scene with Kinney in the boardroom was already quite unsettling, but you still could laugh, well it was a sick but yet still desperate laugh, there was still something funny about it, but when it came to the full Monty in this scene, oh boy! I couldn't believe that they where laughing at him and making jokes, so sick and depraved, it is hard to believe, but sometimes humans can be so cruel to each other, you just have to watch the news to find out, that this is sadly but quite common, in one form or the other. But if you really keep your focus on the story, you can experience something wonderful, despite all the vile and cruel images. This movie is so much Satire, Comedy, Science-Fiction, even Horror! But most important it is a great drama!Most people i know, have never seen the original Robocop, they only saw the sequels or the TV shows, or they just oversaw the movie, as what it is. I more or less forced some of my friends to watch Robocop in it's unedited form and all of them where more or less shocked about Murphys death scene, but all told me in the end how wrong they where prejudging or misunderstanding the movie and they all said, that this is a great classic and unsettling drama. It is disguised though, but if you strip Robocop of all the robots and cyborgs, all the guns and drugs, all the corporative slime-bags and thugs, what you then have is a drama and a great one too! It is about the loss of identity, about the value of life, it shows how fragile we are and that we can die any second and that all we take for granted can vanish in an instant!As Verhoven mentioned himself Robocop is about the paradise lost, something you remember, but never can return to. I restrain my self now, because there is so much more to say about this movie, some things probably said, but if you want to see a great action film, a right in your face satire, if you like robots and cool old school stop-motion, if you like extreme bloody violence and if you have a strong stomach, then i only can recommend Robocop! I could write more about this movie, as many others did and could, but you really should see it for your self!Ignore the flaws of this classic and focus on what is important The drama of Alex J. Murphy!!! And you will see and this is guaranteed a fantastic movie!!!

But if you really keep your focus on the story, you can experience something wonderful, despite all the vile and cruel images. This movie is so much Satire, Comedy, Science-Fiction, even Horror! But most important it is a great drama!Most people i know, have never seen the original Robocop, they only saw the sequels or the TV shows, or they just oversaw the movie, as what it is. I more or less forced some of my friends to watch Robocop in it's unedited form and all of them where more or less shocked about Murphys death scene, but all told me in the end how wrong they where prejudging or misunderstanding the movie and they all said, that this is a great classic and unsettling drama. It is disguised though, but if you strip Robocop of all the robots and cyborgs, all the guns and drugs, all the corporative slime-bags and thugs, what you then have is a drama and a great one too! It is about the loss of identity, about the value of life, it shows how fragile we are and that we can die any second and that all we take for granted can vanish in an instant!As Verhoven mentioned himself Robocop is about the paradise lost, something you remember, but never can return to. I restrain my self now, because there is so much more to say about this movie, some things probably said, but if you want to see a great action film, a right in your face satire, if you like robots and cool old school stop-motion, if you like extreme bloody violence and if you have a strong stomach, then i only can recommend Robocop! I could write more about this movie, as many others did and could, but you really should see it for your self!Ignore the flaws of this classic and focus on what is important The drama of Alex J. Murphy!!! And you will see and this is guaranteed a fantastic movie!!!

But knowing Wong Kar-Wai, did you really expect a regular martial arts movie? 'cos that's not what you'll get...Best known for his In the Mood for Love and 2046, this stylish director has established his reputation among Asians and Westerners alike through his dreamy, poetic romances and metaphysical dramas. Here, in Ashes of Time, an earlier film remade, the director's teamwork with cinematographer Christopher Doyle is already in full bloom. The film offers the same colour palette and style that we find in their more recent collaborative works. This film is beautiful to look at, a mystery to behold and a genre-breaking ode to love and loss. Clearly, it looks and feels like a 21st century movie, but its origins go back some years.Based on a film originally released back in 1994, Ashes of Time Redux is a retelling a story that most of us missed the first time around. The redux is more than a remastered version of the original. Apparently it features significant alterations to the basic structure of the narrative as well a new musical score. More than that, it stands as the definite version of the movie, a true director's cut. It's almost a kind of second birth, because finally the movie can become known for what it truly is. Even though I have not seen the original, I will take the director's word for it and trust his judgment.And it is very easy to trust his judgment when the result is as strong as this relatively short (93 min) film. It feels like a labour of love. There must be heaps and heaps of discarded film on the editing floor, because it is clear that all the little details and cuts were hand-crafted to perfection. My main problem with the film is that it is unforgiving to its audiences, even careless about how they might feel about being bombarded with constant, overloaded verbiage. The result, full of symbolic links and razor-thin internal connections, may feel over-stylized and over-worked, but this kind of approach to film-making is admirable because it is so rare. Films that demand a lot also reward the viewer for paying attention. But don't get me wrong this is not a puzzle or a mystery like some Lynch film; nor is it surrealistic dream logic like some Buñuel. No, it conveys a surprisingly simple poetic truth, encompassing love, manhood, relationships, struggle, perseverance, betrayal, fantasy, hate, jealousy, remembrance, forgetfulness, loss and loneliness. It is a movie about forgetting, and about the forgetting of having forgotten in the first place. It portrays characters as duplicates, mirages and psychic phantoms. Identities are mixed up. Friendships are won and lost, mainly lost. Love is first fleeting, then impossible and finally a memory.Memory, and time, and the passing of time these are the central themes of this tale divided up into (non-linear) seasons. Nature is cyclical, and so is human life and especially human memory, which is always obsessed about some recurring dream or fantasy.

Both the male characters and the elusive female characters are perfectly cast, and the fact that it's an all-star cast does not make it feel any less authentic.

To call Wong Kar-Wai a pessimist is to call outer space cold it is rather to miss the point, to understate the case. He is not a pessimist but an explorer of love's tragic journey in life, from conception to annihilation. He takes us, as it were, beyond the here into the yonder, and gives us intimations of love's afterlife.The film is not perfect. It is oftentimes too self-absorbed. The audience will be split.

My main problem with the film is that it is unforgiving to its audiences, even careless about how they might feel about being bombarded with constant, overloaded verbiage.

Not here! Spectacular acting, great story and direction. This is a drama that is brought to life in the realistic portrayals by Renee Zellweger and Vincent D'Onofrio. I have never really liked Renee much. Seen most of her films, including Jerry McGuire, Chicago, Cold Mountain, Bridget Jones, etc and and thought what is the big fuss about? However, I saw this film later after all her successes and was blown away by her performance. This in my opinion is by far her best work - she and D'Onofrio were so compelling in every scene that it leaves me wanting more each time I see it. I wish they would find another vehicle to work in together. Of course Vincent is is his normal larger than life performance. He always entirely captures my attention whenever he is on the screen in any film - but he made the person of Robert E. Howard come alive and even though I never knew much about this author, I wanted to read the book written by Novalyne Price after I saw the film the first time. Their physical difference in height was interesting contrast because you don't notice it after awhile because of both of their strong performances - they share equally and I loved the contrast in how physical the portrayal by Vincent was and how internal the portrayal by Renee. Since this is a drama, it's not a film that you tell all your friends to watch - they just won't understand. But you tell everyone who has a passion for film making to watch it and without exception they all love it and thank you for turning them on to it. If you tell someone to see this because it's a love story - they are going to be really depressed when it is over so I am careful when recommending it - its a tragic love story that is a true labor of love by the entire production team is a much better description. The director, producers and enter cast and crew gave this little gem so much love and attention, and it shows - I think that if this film was made now and Mirmax distributed it, or was debuted at the right festival it would be a film that would be recognized and given the much deserved awards and distribution it deserves.

","genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"27 September 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This resulted in four well-deserved Academy Awards in 2002 Best Picture for Brian Grazer and the people at Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard for his direction, Jennifer Connelly for her supporting role, and Akive Goldsman for his script adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography. It is a beautiful and touching movie, uplifting and full of a lot of things that Hollywood does very well. Russell Crowe is believable as the arrogant yet vulnerable mathematician John Nash who fell into paranoid schizophrenia while an undergraduate at Princeton University. A philandering and selfish man who is paradoxically almost as lovable as Albert Einstein, Nash can also be humble and exhibit a wry, self-effacing sense of humor. To me he is a great hero, not because of his work in Game Theory for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, but because he is one of the very few people ever to conquer, as it were, schizophrenia. In the outstanding documentary from The American Experience PBS series, A Brilliant Madness (2002) Nash explains how he did it he just stopped listening to the voices. The voices that the paranoid schizophrenic hears are inside his head and they are amazingly persuasive; the delusions are as compelling as monstrous personages come to life, vivid, demanding, in many ways more real than the reality we normally experience. So it really was heroic of John Nash to come to grips with his delusions and to mentally shove them aside. The vast majority of paranoid schizophrenics can never do that. Yet the movie merely resembles his life and his singular experience. Goldsman's script and Howard's direction take the life of John Nash and distill the essence of his triumph while brushing aside many of the unpleasant and non-heroic details. I don't object to this because this movie is clearly aimed at the widest possible audience, and I appreciate the wisdom of that approach. But for those of you interested in a more comprehensive and objective picture of the man I can recommend both the documentary mentioned above and Nasar's biography. I especially found it valuable to view the one-hour documentary because to actually see the man and to hear him speak allowed me to better appreciate the fine performance by Russell Crowe. I found Jennifer Connelly absolutely mesmerizing as Alicia (not to mention gorgeous). Ed Harris was a hardcore graphic nightmare as the unrelenting Parcher while Paul Bettany was intriguing and clever as Nash's nonexistent buddy. Howard's direction not only got excellent work from everybody, but he was able to bring the pathos and exhilaration of Nash's life to the audience in a very satisfying way emotionally. If you can watch this without shedding a tear or two you may want to check your synaptic connections. Incidentally the makeup work on Crowe and Connelly to allow us the illusion of the passing years was outstanding (and got an Oscar nomination). The key to the movie and to Howard's vision is the way that the real world and the Nash's delusional world are meshed. It's clear he wanted to compel the audience to share the paranoid schizophrenic experience. While not a paranoid schizophrenic myself I have known people who are, and I have had similar, limited experiences myself under certain, shall we say, circumstances. The sheer terror that can sometimes be felt came through in the car chase scene (yes, Howard managed to get one in) while Nash's obsessive energy was revealed on the walls of the rooms that he had completely covered with pages from magazines that he had frantically searched looking for secret Soviet codes. Some quibbles while undergraduates loved beer then as they do now, they did not in 1946 go out for pizza, and if they had they would have called it pizza pie. There were no pizza parlors and no pizza at the market. If you went to an Italian restaurant you had spaghetti or ravioli, and the pizza that was served was mostly bread with a thin topping of cheese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today. New Zealander Russell Crowe's West Virginia accent faded in some scenes only to return strong in another. Incidentally he is not to be confused with Cameron Crowe, who wrote the script for Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and directed such films as Jerry Maguire (1996) and Almost Famous (2000). Russell Crowe has starred in a number of excellent movies including Proof (1991), LA Confidential (1997), The Insider (1999), etc. Also, no mention in the movie is made of Nash's homosexual experiences nor of his running away to Europe or his desire to renounce his US citizenship. I understand that Howard decided to leave out the homosexual angle because associating homosexuality with schizophrenia would open a can of worms that would detract from the theme of the movie. Also left out was Nash's other paternity with a woman he never married. Nash is not a saint, but he is a hero, and this beautiful movie is a fine tribute to him and his accomplishments.

The voices that the paranoid schizophrenic hears are inside his head and they are amazingly persuasive; the delusions are as compelling as monstrous personages come to life, vivid, demanding, in many ways more real than the reality we normally experience. So it really was heroic of John Nash to come to grips with his delusions and to mentally shove them aside. The vast majority of paranoid schizophrenics can never do that. Yet the movie merely resembles his life and his singular experience. Goldsman's script and Howard's direction take the life of John Nash and distill the essence of his triumph while brushing aside many of the unpleasant and non-heroic details. I don't object to this because this movie is clearly aimed at the widest possible audience, and I appreciate the wisdom of that approach. But for those of you interested in a more comprehensive and objective picture of the man I can recommend both the documentary mentioned above and Nasar's biography. I especially found it valuable to view the one-hour documentary because to actually see the man and to hear him speak allowed me to better appreciate the fine performance by Russell Crowe. I found Jennifer Connelly absolutely mesmerizing as Alicia (not to mention gorgeous). Ed Harris was a hardcore graphic nightmare as the unrelenting Parcher while Paul Bettany was intriguing and clever as Nash's nonexistent buddy. Howard's direction not only got excellent work from everybody, but he was able to bring the pathos and exhilaration of Nash's life to the audience in a very satisfying way emotionally. If you can watch this without shedding a tear or two you may want to check your synaptic connections. Incidentally the makeup work on Crowe and Connelly to allow us the illusion of the passing years was outstanding (and got an Oscar nomination). The key to the movie and to Howard's vision is the way that the real world and the Nash's delusional world are meshed. It's clear he wanted to compel the audience to share the paranoid schizophrenic experience. While not a paranoid schizophrenic myself I have known people who are, and I have had similar, limited experiences myself under certain, shall we say, circumstances. The sheer terror that can sometimes be felt came through in the car chase scene (yes, Howard managed to get one in) while Nash's obsessive energy was revealed on the walls of the rooms that he had completely covered with pages from magazines that he had frantically searched looking for secret Soviet codes. Some quibbles while undergraduates loved beer then as they do now, they did not in 1946 go out for pizza, and if they had they would have called it pizza pie. There were no pizza parlors and no pizza at the market. If you went to an Italian restaurant you had spaghetti or ravioli, and the pizza that was served was mostly bread with a thin topping of cheese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today. New Zealander Russell Crowe's West Virginia accent faded in some scenes only to return strong in another. Incidentally he is not to be confused with Cameron Crowe, who wrote the script for Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and directed such films as Jerry Maguire (1996) and Almost Famous (2000). Russell Crowe has starred in a number of excellent movies including Proof (1991), LA Confidential (1997), The Insider (1999), etc. Also, no mention in the movie is made of Nash's homosexual experiences nor of his running away to Europe or his desire to renounce his US citizenship. I understand that Howard decided to leave out the homosexual angle because associating homosexuality with schizophrenia would open a can of worms that would detract from the theme of the movie. Also left out was Nash's other paternity with a woman he never married. Nash is not a saint, but he is a hero, and this beautiful movie is a fine tribute to him and his accomplishments.

It is a beautiful and touching movie, uplifting and full of a lot of things that Hollywood does very well. Russell Crowe is believable as the arrogant yet vulnerable mathematician John Nash who fell into paranoid schizophrenia while an undergraduate at Princeton University. A philandering and selfish man who is paradoxically almost as lovable as Albert Einstein, Nash can also be humble and exhibit a wry, self-effacing sense of humor. To me he is a great hero, not because of his work in Game Theory for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, but because he is one of the very few people ever to conquer, as it were, schizophrenia.

'The Pelican Brief' is extremely well handled. It has a slow, almost beguiling, plot development. But the quality of direction and the acting of its two leads seldom lets the story flag. It runs for well over 2-hours, And this gives Alan J Pakula, the director, plenty of time to realise his work without any botched haste. Here; strange-faced Julia Roberts plays the law student with an eye for conspiracies, Darby Shaw. When a couple of Supreme Court Judges get bumped-off, her published speculation falls into the wrong hands. Pretty soon Ms Shaw is also in the firing-line. She narrowly escapes a car bomb and, realising that she's been marked, goes on the run. Denzel Washington plays investigative journalist Gray Grantham. He becomes her confidante when all the other people she contacts get wasted. Beginning with wary suspicion, their relationship develops into one of mutual trust and respect. They are both fine actors and each gives a thoroughly believable presentation that doesn't descend into the usual trite and hammily predictable romance. The more these two begin to unravel her conspiracy, the more they become entangled in it. There are wonderfully observed moments of tension along the way. I particularly like the 'man in the wardrobe' scene, where his presence is barely hinted at as the mirror-door just opens an inch or two. You don't notice the door open so much as the reflection shrink. It's a very nicely observed little detail. Suddenly it becomes a life-or-death race in a multi-story car park. Again, the director makes use of another sly trick of reflection. These small details seem to hark back to an earlier, more intelligent age of cinematography entailing the likes of Orson Welles or Hitchcock. There is little in the way of pyrotechnics. A couple of cars explode. Bloody moments are equally low-key by most of today's standards. They're as gross as a good thriller should be. Short, shocking and rare. The ending is uncluttered by excessive schmaltz. Most of the villains are caught. The FBI get on the case. Ms Shaw disappears with their assistance. The hinted romance is still never more than a hint.A very strong and believable supporting cast of American character actors like John Heard and Robert Culp give the movie an additional stamp of plausibility. Editing is unobtrusive. Lighting and sound are as good as you could wish for. It's technically very competent.If anything; the conspiracy itself looks a little far-fetched. It seems highly unlikely that a top-flight law firm would engage in assassinations. It also seems equally unlikely that there would be 'people surrounding the president' who would 'stop at nothing' in order to see him re-elected. I can't imagine anyone risking a stint in the electric-chair - or whatever - in order to advance the political careers of the sort of shallow dimwits who find their way to the oval office these days.

I mean I'm pretty sure not even half of the audience picked up that this was supposed to be a satire of a bunch of movies they never saw. Really all they fell for was the old slasher formula, slightly updated. Hell it's not a bad formula. As a scary movie this doesn't work, since the killer is not menacing at all so there never seems to be any danger. Because there are just some characters that are not supposed to die, the killer at times becomes unrealistically weak or dumb, and that's something I could have gone without. But it's just so brilliant to have these people waking up in their own slasher movie having to follow a bunch of movie rules to survive, I could appreciate that.

Fellow Gothic Horror enthusiast have warned me about the film, and so did several other reviews on this great page, but as an enthusiastic fan of even the cheesier kind of Gothic Tales, who loved the other Amicus Productions, I still decided to buy it cheaply, especially since Vincent Price is my all-time favorite actor. The warnings sadly turned out to be reasonable, as the film is an unworthy final entry to Amicus' reign in the Horror-omnibus world. The film is no total disaster, but it is entirely disappointing, which even the film's great cast does not change. While all the Amicus films had a (usually great) sense of humor, this one provides little more than absolutely mindless slapstick, and is accompanied by terrible music that will annoy the hell out of the viewer. What makes this even more disappointing is the fact that director Roy Ward Baker is a more than capable man, who enriched the World of Horror with such great films as Quatermass And The Pit, Scars Of Dracula, or The Vampire Lovers, which he made for the Hammer Studios. Even though disappointing, however, The Monster Club is still worth checking out for its superb cast. The film stars none less than three all-time Horror-greats, Vincent Price, John Carradine, and Donald Pleasence, as well as the always sexy Britt Ekland in a small role. The great cast is a reason to watch the film, and yet expectations should be kept low - The film is among the least memorable in either of the three Horror stars' repertoires, and the beautiful Miss Ekland has only a very small role.A Horror story writer (Carradine) runs into a vampire named Erasmus (Price), who subsequently takes him to a 'Monster Club' at which all types of monsters, such as Vampires, Ghouls, Werewolves and hybrids such as 'Vamghouls'. Erasmus then narrates three stories in order to explain the diversity of Monster species to his guest. The first and second stories are merely satirical, and in a very silly way. The first one, which introduces the monster species 'Shadmock', is amusing, in a way, but unfortunately also quite tedious. The second story, a slapstick vampire story which is actually a film in the film, is the worst of the three, very simple and even more silly, even though it is this one which stars both Donald Pleasence and Britt Ekland. The third story, a Ghoul story, is a lot better than the other two, and the only part of the film that has a certain creepiness. Hollywood tough guy Staurt Whitman plays a film director who visits a remote ghost-town - with ghoulish results... Inbetween the stories, the film switches back to the Monster club, where a dreadful band plays extremely dreadful 80s pop music. The music is so awful it is hard to listen to, and I admittedly watched most of the concerts at the Monster Club in the fast forward mode. The visibly aged stars, Carradine and Price are far from their best, and yet it is them who make the film a lot more worthwhile, especially Price brings in some great wit more than once. Overall, The Monster Club is watchable for its stars, and for the decent last story, but I can certainly not recommend it. My advice Watch the other Amicus productions, or any other film starring Vincent Price instead!

In fact, you could even say that it isn't a single movie - rather, it's several shorts combined together, with the single connecting thread being the red violin that we watch change hands over the course of a little over 300 years. Built in Italy in 1681, the stories follow the violin through France, Austria, England, Hong Kong, Communist China and finally to an auction house in Montreal, Canada where it's to be sold. The nature of the movie being what it is, some of the stories are stronger than others. The one that really stood out powerfully for me was the depiction of the Cultural Revolution in China.There's a somewhat effective mystery that also holds things together. In 1681, the violin maker's wife went to a fortune teller before she died in childbirth, and the movie makes clear that somehow her fortune is being fulfilled through the violin's travels. I had an advantage coming in, because I knew the basic story and so the explanation of the violin's connection to the woman came as no surprise, but to give credit to the writers, had I not known the story coming in I don't think there's any way I would have figured out the mystery.It's hard to rate the performances here. Again, the nature of the movie worked against being able to identify anyone as the star of the movie. The biggest name was probably Samuel L. Jackson, but he really didn't have a major part until the last half hour or so. I wasn't really keeping track, but if memory serves, the most screen time probably went to Colm Feore, but his role as the auctioneer didn't really stretch him.Overall, I'd characterize this as a movie that really didn't pull me in, but one with a few parts that I thought were very well done. In all honesty, though, I don't think I'd be tempted to watch it again. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 September 2008","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" In many respects this is a rather unusual movie.
