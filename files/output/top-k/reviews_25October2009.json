[{"date":"25 October 2009","score":"","review":" Recap Tim Dunphy grows up in Pawtucket. His brother is in a wheelchair, his father raising them alone and struggling to get by. There isn't much to do but drink and smoke pot. But after driving, both drunk and stoned, and crashing at full speed into a parked police car, his life is about to change. But not in the way he thinks. Due to some odd connections, instead of getting jail, he get sent to a posh prep school. There he got to fight for his place and identity, and fight against the sadistic student master Funderburk. And then there is a girl.Comments An average and pretty standard growing up story with most of the clichés about growing up. The struggle to find one's identity and path in life. You got the struggling youth in a struggling home, drinking and smoking, who then due some hardships learns to take responsibility and set a path for himself. And of course meets a girl. Nothing new.A movie written by the Farrely brothers and director Corrente this should not be confused with comedies like Dumb & Dumber or There's something about Mary. Outside Providence is quirky and delivers a fun remark now and then, but not at all in line with movies more thought of when you hear that the Farrelys has been involved. Outside Providence is much more a drama with a romantic flair and some comedy spice.A lot of known actors appear, mostly in small supporting roles, while the story is more focused on young more unknown actors. The exception being Amy Smart that of course is the romantic interest. A solid performance from her once again, it is still a puzzle for me why she hasn't made it bigger than she has. As far as I can tell she both got the looks and the talent.Not a movie to remember, and not a movie I would recommend. Not that it is bad, because it certainly isn't. But because there are others that are much better in each comparable genre.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 October 2009","score":"","review":" Recap Tim Dunphy grows up in Pawtucket.
