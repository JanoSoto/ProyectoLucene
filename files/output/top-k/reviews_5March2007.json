Many say or think that, at the point of death, your whole life --- maybe only a part? -- flashes before your eyes. And who knows what you really see, anyway..? That's what this movie is all about it provides a glimpse of what might have been going on inside Donnie's head in the brief few seconds before he dies when a 747 engine drops though the roof of his parents' house and lands on top of him. So, all that you see from the start of this movie until near the end is simply Donnie's (Jake Gyllenhaal) last thoughts for this earth. Very near the start of the story, Donnie has a vision, meeting a strange figure called Frank who tells him that his world is coming to an end. That's a clue that Donnie's dying but I didn't cotton onto that until much later in the plot...This narrative structure has been done at least once before that I know of Jacob's Ladder (1990) had the story of a Vietnam soldier dying on an operating table. That story was again the soldier's weird thoughts before he succumbed to his wounds. If you haven't seen it, it is worth the time; but, it's quite a scary movie for some.I'd seen Gyllenhaal, for the first time, not so long ago in Jarhead (2005) a movie I didn't like but was much impressed by his acting. So, that's one of the reasons I saw this one his intensity is once again at the forefront of all the characters in Donnie Darko.At another level, this movie is also partly about the American Dream and the lies that support it there's the dream psychology coach Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze), and what a ham he is, and very cunning to boot because he's got a nasty, dirty little secret; there's the idealistic English teacher Karen Pomeroy (Drew Barrymore) who's trying to open the students' minds to the delights of language &#150; and gets more than she bargained for; there's the phys-ed coach Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant) who wants her girls to win a national dancing competition, and will stop at nothing to get it; there's school principal Cole (David Moreland) who wants nothing more than peace, quiet, and all the metaphorical garbage kept out of public view; and finally there's Donnie's family, (see cast list), jaded, all mixed up, almost brain dead, and resigned to la dolce vita, or what passes for that each good morning, America.As Donnie, we learn from the story what might have happened had he lived, and as the final tune and final scenes play, what still might happen. Those final scenes are out of kilter with the whole thrust of the story (much like Jacob's Ladder, where the viewer knows what happens after the soldier dies &#150; a narrative inconsistency) because Donnie's dead and the whole thing was his thoughts anyway. However, directors must cater for the viewer, tie up loose ends, and hope that nobody notices... But, heck, in a fantasy dressed up as science fiction, anything can happen, right? I really enjoyed this movie good performances, snappy dialog, very effective cinematography, and quite funny in parts. Recommended.

To sum it up you have a murdered CIA hit-man who makes a deal with a devil, comes back as deformed creature with strange powers, and has to deal with a psychotic demon in clown form. Umm, yeah. Maybe Sam Raimi or Guillermo Del Toro could'be made such a film, but alas, they didn't, and the result is an inept production.I'll start with the good points; John Leguizamo is perfect as the Clown; both over the top and malevolent. And a few of the visual effects are impressive. And there were a few nods to the comics (Sam and Twitch making a cameo at the end). But that's about it. Here's every other problem 1. Michael Jai White just sucks as the lead. He's terrible. His interpretation of Spawn is not particularly heroic, or anti-heroic, or likable, or has any character moments, but is just an angry guy yelling I'mma gonna kill Wynn! Arrgg!! These powers rock! Gone are any of the philosophical underpinnings of the character.2. Hell and the devil Malebolia - laughable, laughable. They could've at least animated the devil's mouth to move in sync with his voice. If this is hell, I just laugh at it. And for those who say Hey, it was 1997; those were the visual effects of the time, I say look at Independence Day, Space Jam, and Titanic, all films made around the same time with superior effects.3. Martin Sheen, whom we all know is a good actor, adds little to the Wynn character. He concocts an idiotic plot about inserting a bomb in his heart, so that no one will dare kill him. This plot line isn't in the comics, but even if it was it would still've been idiotic. Doctors are really going to insert a bomb in someone's heart and not think Gee, this guy's gonna die someday, so there's no question this bomb will go off and kill people someday? 4. Child actor Miko Hughes shows up in a subplot, and has to look for Spawn's dog. WTF? It's like the producers realized We should make this more family friendly by giving Spawn a kid sidekick, but then realized there really wasn't anything he could do, so they had him go look for a dog instead.5. And after all this, we have a mess of a climax. Spawn fights off the Clown in Hell by transporting through the fireplace! And then we get the big cliché about ending with a shot of Spawn looking out on the city he will now protect. Please. An unsatisfying ending, due to zero character development or reason to care about any of the saving that Spawn did throughout the movie.But there is some good in the world after all, I walked out of this knowing that if any demonic Clown comes after me, I sure can count on Spawn to decapitate him for me. And if my dog ever runs away, I can count on Miko Hughes to find him for me. And if I ever get confused during a movie, I can count on Nicol Williamson's tacked-on voice-over to provide exposition.And finally, if I ever go to hell, I know I can look forward to a place filled with cartoon characters.

The story has a young man living with his over protective mother in the 1950's who one day while spying on her son & his new love at a zoo, she is bitten by a cursed Sumerian rat monkey & thus dies, returning to life as a zombie that soon infects others, making it harder for the son to take care of the decomposing stiffs that he must keep in his house as a secret & for the protection of mankind, but naturally things get out of hand anyways.

Jim Jarmusch has put a lot of poetry in his film like in Ghost Dog, but in Dead Man he put poetry in all the film and for me that is wonderful because Jarmusch once want to be a poet (thank god that he became filmmaker because is a master). About the actors, well Johnny Deep is just excellent and also the guy who plays like Nobody (sorry fellas, i don't remember his name), for me the others actors well just great and well, we can see them a lot. The music is another aspect that i love in this film, Neil Young is a great guitar player and in this film we can see that because all the music is composed and performance by Neil Young and of course is beautiful the direction of Jarmsuch.

I think this had a polarizing effect on audiences. People who just went to see a movie said wow, that was a great movie and made me think a little, while people who went to see spaceships and aliens said I waited for two and a half ours to see an alien and it was her &@#% dad. Contact is not a movie about radio telescopes, data encryption, aliens, spacecraft, or time travel, though all of these things are critical to the plot. Nor is it a movie about religion, despite the main character being hounded for her lack of belief in God. At its core, Contact is a movie about belief without proof, about the ability of human beings to draw strength from what they know to be true within themselves.Astronomer Dr. Eleanor Arroway (Jodie Foster) is led by her belief in scientific principles, as well as the untimely death of her parents, to doubt the existence of God. As a scientist, she simply cannot fathom the presence of an almighty being that can't be explained by scientific principles. Her counterpart, Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a man of faith. He was made so by an experience during which he says he felt god, and could not deny it, regardless of what anybody else believes. As such, Joss cannot envision a world without a God. This makes them seemingly polar opposites, which could be the setup for yet another boring opposites attract romantic subplot, but as the movie reveals, the two are actually very similar.In short, Dr. Arroway's search for extraterrestrial life becomes a success when she discovers a message sent by aliens containing instructions on how to build an interstellar transport device. Unfortunately, the device can house only one human, and Dr. Arroway's lack of belief in God leads the international selection committee to pass on her, feeling she does not effectively represent humanity. 95% of the world believes without hard evidence that a God exists, leaving Dr. Arroway as an outsider.During the process, however, we see that in some ways, Dr. Arroway indeed has more faith than the religious 95%. Where many suspect the alien plans of being malicious, Dr. Arroway remains resolute that the message was delivered in the language of science, and must therefore represent a desire to increase knowledge, not to conquer. She also exhibits faith in the design of the transport device itself. While others want to add safety devices not illustrated in the schematics, she has faith that the aliens' design is exact and should not be altered.After the first device is destroyed by terrorists, Dr. Arroway is chosen to go aboard a second device. Once onboard, she appears to fly through space, meet an alien and discuss humanity's place in the universe, and return home. During her trip, Dr. Arroway experiences a celestial event that is so beautiful she cannot describe it. She is moved to tears as she whispers that she has no words to describe it, that they should have sent a poet. This subtle moment entirely alters Dr. Arroway and her perception of the universe, as neither English, or her favorite language, science, can adequately describe the beauty of the event. This is Dr. Arroway's equivalent of Palmer Joss meeting God.However, from outside the vehicle, it appears that she never left Earth, since the vehicle was only out of contact for a split second. She has no evidence of her experience, no artifacts brought back from distant stars, no photographs of aliens, nothing. Now the shoe is on the other foot. Dr. Arroway believes without physical proof that she went somewhere, but the world, and in particular the congressional committee called to investigate the mission, is skeptical and rejects her story. After the mission she is still an outsider, but the sides have been reversed. Before the mission, it was painful to watch Dr. Arroway being pushed aside because she does not believe, but after the mission it is even more painful to watch as she is asked to deny her belief, her truth, something which defines her as a person. However, we recognize that her belief in her experience is just the same as Joss' belief that he felt God, and this belief without proof forms a bond between the two. We are made to think about the invaluable nature of one's beliefs, whatever they may be, and just how central our idea of truth is to our existence.Now to the flaw I mentioned, which is the only reason I rate this film a 9 instead of a 10. It comes at the end, when Rachel Constantine and Micheal Kitz discuss the contents of Dr. Arroway's mission recorder. Dr. Arroway mentioned earlier that her experience lasted approximately 18 hours. Constantine states that the recorder contained approximately 18 hours of static. This ruins the ending of the movie, because it proves beyond any reasonable doubt that Dr. Arroway's experience was real. Up to this moment the audience is allowed to be split as to their beliefs. We may want to believe in Dr. Arroway's fantastic journey, but we have to weigh that against her loneliness, her need to validate her research, and her fervent belief in extraterrestrial life. Did she actually leave? Was it a hoax by Hadden as Kitz suggests? Is Hadden actually from Vega? Did she imagine the whole thing? Is she lying? How can we decide? It's a question of belief, but the data recorder removes the audience from the equation and makes the decision for us.In a movie about belief without proof, why ham-handedly supply proof? Why is the audience not left to believe what they want?

Managing to differ between playing brutal, yet sensitive characters to directing films centred on hard-boiled, cops vs. criminals plots. Takeshi Kitano remains one of the finest actors in cinema, most film viewers were introduced to his acting after watching Battle Royale, which has had a huge effect of his recognition. He is an actor who can bury himself deep inside a role, becoming a dark, disillusioned character and being cast as characters who are usually coming to terms with the guilt of their past. Well known for his deadpan style he has developed into an icon of modern Asian cinema.Hana-bi is the haunting, powerful, thoughtful tale of a severe police officer who retires from the force after his wife gets leukaemia and a fellow officer gets paralysed from an accident that he blames himself for. The film follows the tragedy and self-destruction in the man's life who wants to help the people he loves before it is too late. The narrative of Hana-bi is one that moves with a fairly slow grace, perfectly suiting the film's mood and structuring a detailed and enigmatically twisted plot.Hana-bi is a prime example of minimalist film-making, providing a poetic journey of self-discovery and accepting the effects of anger. Hana-bi is far from an aggressive film, even though the violence is stark, abrupt, restrained, brutal, unflinching and at times strangely beautiful in its film techniques. The literal translation of the title Hana-bi translates to fireworks, which is a metaphor for the brief explosion of life we live. The pensive feel is relaxing rather than brooding, flooded by sudden flashbacks of violence, which wonderfully grab the viewer's attention. There is also an element of dark humour paced throughout the film, which makes you laugh, but also makes you ponder the film's deep philosophical, moralistic and nihilistic imagery.The acting from the entire cast is stunningly provocative and moving, edged with the factor of such a brilliant script, yet it is a film that does not rely on language as a key factor. Few performances have moved me with such provoking and eventually challenging studies of human characteristics, emotion and psychology. The metaphorical, subliminal and emblematic cinematography is marvellous at carefully capturing some of the most unforgettable imagery in cinema. The haunting score is truly remarkable n its aching sophistication and elegance, ultimately helping define a clear atmosphere. It is undoubtedly a pessimistic film on the surface, although still being a film that holds hope under the façade.Hana-bi is perfect cinema. Few films come quite as close to its breathtaking brilliance and overwhelming nature. Sublime, in every sense of the word, its beauty will knock you right out.

A very good one, perhaps, but no more than that. To those who don't know a lot about films it is indeed probably a rather silly film about a man in a tin can shooting people. Indeed, on the surface, it pretty much is. Looking deeper the film it is clearly something of a revenge film, about a cop who is brutally murdered and comes back to avenge his death. But at the heart of the film, RoboCop is a story about the human spirit and how, despite however many mechanical additions are made to a person, they are still the same man underneath.Murphy is a regular cop, with a wife who he loves dearly and a son who he loves and tries to make happy, even if it is just through the simplest of things like imitating his son's favourite television character. He is of course though brutally murdered by a gang of thieves, and when he returns months later, is a cyborg law enforcer(a product of corporate America, in essence) who, despite the best efforts of the company who 'built' him (OCP), underneath all of the fancy new equipment he is still the same cop that began the film.

Indeed, there are only a few times when the film invokes moment of excess and comic book-style violence. But this is always to get the point across. The ED-209 boardroom sequence, where the robot malfunctions and utterly obliterates a member of the board (and the following line somebody call a paramedic! when the man had been shot hundreds of times), is simply showing how warped corporate America has become. The same can be said for many of the films most violent scenes, such as Emil not only melting alive from the toxic waste, but then being run over and exploding like a water balloon, and even Murphy's own death at the hands of Clearance's gang, where Verhoeven just pushes the scene into ludicrous proportions when Murphy's entire right arm is blown off; although it is a scene of horror, when the arm goes one is almost forced to laugh as it is simply so silly. The violence isn't there to be 'cool,' it is a metaphor for the ridiculousness of many aspects of American society.And unlike most robot\/cyborg films, the central character is not an unstoppable, cool and morally correct individual. RoboCop is a flawed human being, encased in a metal shell, trying to come to terms with his new existence (never has an actor invoked such a tearful performance using just his jawline), and whose actions are often morally ambiguous; for example, every time he stops a crime he does a lot more damage than the criminal was doing (destroying the convenience store, blowing up the petrol station etc.).The political and social satire, the brutal graphic violence, the tragedy of the main character, the special effects (which at the time were groundbreaking, and really haven't dated too badly at all), the brilliant main theme and the message of the film all place it among the very best that cinema has produced. Paul Verhoeven is a master director, and RoboCop is undoubtedly his (American?) masterpiece.To conclude, then, RoboCop is an action film with a heart, so much so that it is in no way shameful to cry at the last exchange of the filmNice shooting, son.

My attention was grabbed by the DVDs cover art which is a repackaging of The Kiss by Gustav Klimt. The late 1800s until World War II was a very unique time in the fields of art, psychology, music, architecture\/design and literature that is very rarely touched upon nowadays. So I had high hopes. But I was disappointed in this movie and I felt it could have been in a much more interesting way. The actors were OK I guess. I don't think they had much in the dialogue department to work with. The points that would have made this much more interesting...the art, music and literary aspects...were just touched upon. But that said, it was billed as a story about one woman's life during this period and how she was a muse to some of the now famous men of the era. Actually I came away being much less sympathetic to this woman than I was before I saw the film. She seemed less of a muse than a woman who used famous men for her own ends. I find it unusual that out of all of Vienna, she managed only to make well-known men her lovers. Men such as Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kolkoschka, Water Gropius, Gustav Mahler and on and on. It really did no favors to this woman's reputation and I viewed her as kind of a user and a whiner. Yes she did not have a lot of freedom but it was the very early 1900s, neither did any other woman. She seemed to have the daring to jump from man to man in the days when this was simply not done in polite society. Yet she did not seem to have the courage to try to make it on her own in the field of music. If she was adventurous enough to throw caution to the wind and live such a bohemian lifestyle, I do not know why she would then have cause to complain about being stifled when she knew full well what marriage in that time entailed. How about having the courage to life your own life and pursue your own dreams in the field of music. Rather than depending on some man to fulfill your dreams then complaining when they are not. So I just found the storyline became very uninteresting very quickly and the other points such as the arts & culture of the time would have added much more interest to the film.

Now whatever the stories about the making of this film, even if Woo had complete control I seriously doubt the film would have been any better, seeing as though Van Damme didn't develop acing skills until very recently. I actually think that the film would have been worse had Woo had complete creative control - pretty much all the action is excellent and if he had attempted to do anything focusing on performance with JC it would have gone tits up. Therefore - and despite John Woo being my favourite director - I think the Van Damme cut we got instead is the best this film is going to get. Sure there is the work print version which is like twenty or so minutes longer, but (from what I have heard - I haven't actually seen it) only a few minutes of that was action and violence, the rest being character or story driven stuff which, quite frankly, I don't give a smeg about, and which would have been impossible to do with his lead.What we're left with then is a film where Van Damme gets to say really silly things like Now take your pig-stick and your boyfriend, and find a bus to catch whilst posing like a bad dude. Plus he gets to kick the absolute crap out of a lot of people, and shoot even more. Also, about those posing shots, I'm guessing Van Damme had control over the music as well, as it is always guitar masturbation whilst Jean Claude and his mullet look out over the horizon.Some of Woo's trademarks remain however, although some have been modified a bit. The hero dealing vast amounts of death with a pistol in each hand is still there and, shock!, we even see him reload; the explosion propelling someone along the floor ready to murder is there; even the opposite window gunfight from Hard Boiled is there; and even the doves are there, although there is only one and it's a... well, pigeon.Regardless, Hard Target is a truly amazing film about a man and his hair cut fighting a war against cheese. Plus, not only does Lance Henriksen feature prominently, and not only does he have what is probably the best death scene ever, not only that, but his coat catches fire and he keeps on acting, refusing to let petty things such as third degree burns get in his way.Hard Target is without a doubt my favourite of John Woo's American films (even though Face\/Off is clearly so much better) and is indeed a personal favourite of mine when it comes to cheese cinema.I think about the only complaint I can muster is that we don't get to see Van Dammes's tight arse.

Sure there is the work print version which is like twenty or so minutes longer, but (from what I have heard - I haven't actually seen it) only a few minutes of that was action and violence, the rest being character or story driven stuff which, quite frankly, I don't give a smeg about, and which would have been impossible to do with his lead.What we're left with then is a film where Van Damme gets to say really silly things like Now take your pig-stick and your boyfriend, and find a bus to catch whilst posing like a bad dude. Plus he gets to kick the absolute crap out of a lot of people, and shoot even more. Also, about those posing shots, I'm guessing Van Damme had control over the music as well, as it is always guitar masturbation whilst Jean Claude and his mullet look out over the horizon.Some of Woo's trademarks remain however, although some have been modified a bit. The hero dealing vast amounts of death with a pistol in each hand is still there and, shock!, we even see him reload; the explosion propelling someone along the floor ready to murder is there; even the opposite window gunfight from Hard Boiled is there; and even the doves are there, although there is only one and it's a... well, pigeon.Regardless, Hard Target is a truly amazing film about a man and his hair cut fighting a war against cheese. Plus, not only does Lance Henriksen feature prominently, and not only does he have what is probably the best death scene ever, not only that, but his coat catches fire and he keeps on acting, refusing to let petty things such as third degree burns get in his way.Hard Target is without a doubt my favourite of John Woo's American films (even though Face\/Off is clearly so much better) and is indeed a personal favourite of mine when it comes to cheese cinema.I think about the only complaint I can muster is that we don't get to see Van Dammes's tight arse.

Only the film's tidy ending lowers it somewhat from being an excellent film.The story concerns a former warrior in both the Civil and Indian Wars, Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) after he settles down in the Dakota territory to raise his 3 sons. Bright, well-educated and well-groomed son Samuel (Henry Thomas) brings home a lovely and also well-groomed fiancé Susannah (Julia Ormond) just before heading off to fight for France in WWI on an idealistic impulse that his father opposes. His other 2 brothers accompany him -- one older and feeling himself to be the most responsible, Alfred (Aidan Quinn), and the other younger and more wild Tristan (Brad Pitt), whose habits and inclinations match the adventurous spirit of his namesake. After Sam is killed in action, the other 2 brothers begin a decades long battle over Susannah's love which divides the family and brings great sadness to everyone's lives.The performances are reasonably well done. Hopkins is always good as a rough former gentleman, and I found his defensive attitude when his sons decide it is their duty to go to war very well done. I also have to admire his work in the second half of the film after a stroke has left his character unable to move the right side of his body. Hopkins' performance becomes more intense and sad as his character recedes more and more into old age. Ormond was suitable but little more.... not only was the character written so that we can't really understand why she ends up marrying Alfred despite being in love with Tristan, but she does little to add to the mystery with her understated way of showing depression later in the film. Quinn does the best work of the 3 sons -- the picture clearly emerges of a man who is trying hard to do the right thing and feels intolerable pain at the fact that his father and even his wife feel more love for the less reliable and amoral Tristan regardless. There are many points in the story where we don't like Alred, but for the most part Quinn enables us to see the character's actions through his own eyes. Pitt's performance varies from very effective to somewhat unconvincing depending on the nature of the scene he's playing. I thought his sadness over Samuel's death was very convincing, but I never 100% bought into the notion that he was so uncivilized that he would just run off for years without leaving a trace or sending word. I never really bought that he was this Davy Crockett type pioneer guy. Part of that is physical and can't be blamed on Pitt -- he's just too pretty to believe that he never sleeps on a bed. There are also some good supporting performances, particularly Gordon Tootoosis who puts in time as a former chieftain who Ludlow has more or less adopted. His presence greatly aids Pitt's attempts to appear as a kind of free spirit of the wild.The film's great strength is in the direction, which distracts the audience from various points that might have seemed cliché. The director's focus is on his characters and he never lets attention wander to the landscape or the scenery for too long, despite the excellent production values.The film's greatest weakness is the fact that distraction would be possible at all, or that you would need such good photography and direction to cover up the somewhat obvious nature of the script. (SPOILER) The death of Tristan's wife was the only real shocker for me, and everything after that point including Alfred's rejoining the fold in the final shoot-out was somewhat predictable.Overall, a very good film of its type.

Paul's girlfriend was smart to give back his engagement ring at the end of this, to prevent her ultimate rape, and or murder. But seriously, I liked the way they continued the story here, although they really didn't explain very thoroughly why Paul moved from Chicago to Los Angeles, maybe he just moved there because there were more rapes per capita, but who knows? There was an interesting story line where the inspector from N.Y. was following Paul to catch him in the act, and possibly try to kill him? But for no apparent reason, he is exterminated in a gun fight helping Paul, and that storyline falls a bit flat.
