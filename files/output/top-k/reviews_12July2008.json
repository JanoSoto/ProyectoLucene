Despite Burton's lack of anything that even approaches depth of character or plot coherence (something that plagues all of his films to various degrees, with only a couple of notable exceptions), Batman is a visual triumph that saturates the screen with haunting images and lurid, colorful tableaux played out against a gloomy German expressionistic background and to an astounding Danny Elfman score.It has been argued that Burton's take on the Dark Knight was the first to take the source material really seriously, but unfortunately, the exact opposite is true. Like 1966's Batman The Movie, Tim Burton's Batman revels in the absurdity of the characters and their situations, but unlike the ultra-hip tongue-in-cheek Adam West campfest, this film is not dedicated to crimefighters the world over and to lovers of the ridiculous, lovers of the bizarre and fun lovers everywhere, but seems instead dedicated to the freaks, the wierdos, the neurotic and the emotionally stunted. It is telling that the Joker is allowed to caper on screen far more than Batman is allowed to fight crime - and given the lack of personality that Michael Keaton brings to his character, it's a small wonder that Jack Nicholson dominates this film. Ostensibly, he's the villain of the piece, but I tend to suspect that Burton sees him more as the underdog hero, the only truly free soul in the dark, steamy, oppressive, monolithic Gotham City. For all the Joker's murder and mayhem, he is a decidedly non-threatening bad-guy, certainly much more interesting than the titular hero, a streak of color and manic energy careening through otherwise grey and muted film-noiresque world. In Burton's world, Batman is the conformist who blends in; the Joker is the rebel misfit. And so it plays out like any other dime-a-dozen overly-emotional oh-so-tragic adolescent romance movie, with the popular rich kid, the misfit outsider, and the blonde cheerleader type they're both trying to win. This isn't a superhero adventure -- it's a John Hughes movie for the geeky Emo set.Given the comic book origins of the material, we can almost forgive some of the more gaping plot holes and glaring logical inconsistencies -- after all, a comic-book film doesn't really have to make sense to be enjoyable -- but the sketchy and insubstantial characters that populate the story are unforgivable, especially given the rich material from which the film was drawn. And even though Michael Keaton's blandness actually works well within the context of his character, Kim Basinger as Vicky Vale is an absolute disaster -- who ever heard of a war correspondent who shreiks and screams and faints as much as she does? Basinger's performance is far and away the worst of the bunch, but the film is otherwise extremely well-cast, with exceptional character actors like Pat Hingle and Michael Gough and dynamic stars like Jack Palance and Billy Dee Williams giving the illusion of depth to cardboard cut-out characters who watch from the sidelines as the hero and the other hero fight over the girl.Far from being the masterpiece of the genre that it is hailed to be, Batman is actually a clunky and uneven mess. As a superhero adventure story, it doesn't even come close to Sam Raimi's Darkman; as a Batman film, it pales in comparison to Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins. Even the animated series that would follow in the wake of the Burton Batman hysteria is better, and it should give one pause to reflect when a half-hour cartoon can be more emotionally resonant than a feature-length film. But this film did pave the way for better written, better casted, better acted and better directed superhero films to follow. It is the ultimate triumph of style over substance, but it is a dazzling style, and after all is said and done, a fun and entertaining film.

From the opening sequence when Gotham City is shown you see the backdrop as dark and the sets in many scenes featured art and odd toys. Really Burton was a mastermind at skewing one's world view with this film by using an old technique from German cinema called mis-en-scene meaning the dark mood sets the tone for a film. Clearly aside from the art and dark sets that filled the scenes of Gotham City the darkness showed in the characters especially with Batman a man with a dark past who lives in the night shadows that features a city of pain yet this is a character that is always on the side of justice. Enter Michael Keaton who in my opinion has been by far the best Batman for the way he took and showed how bottled up the character could be with sadness yet his comedic sensibility mixed well with his dark explosive style. Also Keaton showed with ease just how his alter ego Bruce Wayne could really standout as a nice and believable rich playboy. We also see Batman as such an unusual man living in a world of pain as when Wayne meets the lovely and attractive Vicki Vale(played wonderful by Kim Basinger)he on one side wants to fall in love like a normal person, but yet due to his nightly obligations of fighting crime as Batman he cannot love in a simple world. Also to add to the problem he must save Gotham from the wild and freaky Joker and he learns much about his arch rival Bruce\/Batman even discovers a dark past secret a tragedy that's connected to the clown prince of crime.Just to mention The Joker who's my favorite Batman villain simply for his laughing and lovable over the top clown style of pranks and gags. But stop the press enter the granddaddy of them all that's Jack Nicholson as The Joker the guy who was the ace in Batman's deck. The Joker so evil yet so liked for his patent satanic majesty style. With Jack who's the finest and best actor in my opinion to ever live who takes each role personal and does the character over the top by doing many scenes with a different style he clearly made the character become full circle. Nicholson himself Considered his work as The Joker a piece of pop art. I for one like many and agree that it was one of the best performances in film history especially for a villain, now who else could have done The Joker better than Jack? Most would agree with me nobody! Overall this blockbuster is thrilling and the action is fast paced and the humor provided pumps very dark and strangely as Burton really mixed things well by making this film dark and edgy showing that the world is never normal and that the mind isn't always understood in a complex world. Yet in the end a gloomy story has a happy ending proving that he and many like Batman live on a cloud above us!

The Twin Towers are still standing. We are entering the profiling era and it was tempting for criminals to return the favor, though they have always done that. They here profile the police and their investigative methods. If you satisfy the police's way of thinking you will go through their net with no difficulty. You just have to convince the cop that a certain criminal does not exist, that this criminal projects you in some kind of legend or saga, is a bogeyman under the bed or in the closet. If the cops are convinced that this bogeyman is a pure collective invention, some folklore in another word, they will just shrug their shoulders and consider the one who is telling the story is, like all the others, haunted or possessed by a phantasm. And it works. He is the only survivor, or nearly, and he convinces them that his criminal persona is a myth. They are dubious, suspicious, skeptical and many other things, but they cannot imagine you are that myth, that criminal and that you are fooling them massively. To play on the impossibility for these cops to believe such a story can exist is your best diversion, disguise. They are ready to buy a lot but not that someone who is a coward, a weak person, a subservient non-entity, what's more a cripple, can be that ruthless, pitiless and unwavering mastermind of crime. Of course the punch line of the film is that the cop realizes he has been fooled because this cripple being the mastermind is the only explanation why he knows all he knows he knows too much to just be an accidental witness. And the punch line is doubled with the composite picture of this fantasized criminal as seen by the other survivor who should not have survived and the criminal does not know he is still alive who has seen him very distinctly. This composite picture, a very sketchy image, is arriving on the fax machine as the cripple straightens up and gets into the car that was waiting for him outside the police station. Too late.

Likewise, the non-linear chronology of the film was also a likely inspiration for many future films, including Christopher Nolan's Memento. But none of these later films come close to Tarantino's original. The greatest strength of this movie, and indeed all of Tarantino's work, is the writing, particularly in terms of dialog. Characters speak as they do in real life, not just to advance a plot, but about random mundanities as well. Tarantino could have been as great a novelist as he is a filmmaker and it shows in this dialog. Musings on McDonald's in Europe or the level of intimacy involved in a foot massage become funnier and more fascinating than one would ever think. Characters also stutter, trip over their words, repeat themselves and use poor grammar (not just as in colloquialisms) just as people do in unscripted real life. Yet the film is so well acted and absorbing that we do not even notice these linguistic imperfections without applying very close scrutiny. As an example of the realism of the dialog, take the famous scene (indeed, one of many famous scenes in the film) in which Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) has overdosed on heroin and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) has taken her to his drug dealer's house for help. The plan is to give her a shot of adrenaline directly to her heart (not a sound strategy according to any literature I've read; you would think they'd have some naloxone on hand for this purpose, but I digress).

Of course, in an emergency situation like this one, tempers would obviously flare. All of Tarantino's films have excellent dialog, but what really sets Pulp Fiction above the rest are the themes of redemption\/salvation and the character arc of Jules Winnfield (Samual L. Jackson). The partner of Vincent Vega, Jules is a bible quoting, murderous hit-man. Jules and Vincent sadistically kill a room full of young men to reacquire the mysterious briefcase, belonging to their boss. In finishing this job, however, they escape death themselves only by an extraordinarily unlikely occurrence. Jules believes a miracle has occurred, but Vincent dismisses it as chance. They debate the implications of what has happened first at the site and later at the restaurant that is the site of the first and last scenes of the film. As they debate, the camera cuts back and forth between them, showing them in opposite profiles and highlighting their opposite world-views. In a moment of clarity Jules decides to give up crime and walk the earth. Vincent is skeptical, but Jules shows he is serious by going out of his way to save the lives of the two more amateurish robbers that attempt to steal the briefcase. Likewise, in one of the other story lines we see Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) risk his own life to save another human being (who only hours before was trying to kill him) from torture. It is these examples of morality from the immoral and of karma working its fatal purpose that make this an often inspiring film. Finally, I have to wonder whether Tarantino even knew how great a film he was making. Pulp Fiction is a tribute to the lurid, disposable so-called 'low' art of the mid 20th Century - poorly dubbed Asian crime films, sci-fi magazines and detective stories, etc. Who would have thought that one of the century's last great works of art would have arisen from such material?

The only difference is I probably won't watch it twice a week for the next two years.The Land Before Time tells a simple story of a dinosaur named Littlefoot, who loses his mother to the deliciously one-dimensional, gravity-defying, vicious tyrannosaur known as Sharptooth. Together with four other lost dinosaurs he searches for the Great Valley, but is slowed by the group's lack of cooperation or trust for one another. The must overcome their personal differences - and the ever-prowling Sharptooth - to reach their goal, and choose to do things the right way, even if that means choosing the hard way.For a movie that suffered so much during its production phase, and one which left the producers and directors dissatisfied, its a wonder LBT underwent the success it did at the box office. Don Bluth delights in making cartoons that are both dark and heartwarming, and LBT is no different. The characters will scream and shiver in fear as Sharptooth prowls around their hiding spot, but in other scenes they laugh and interact as would 'normal' children. Due to Spielberg's influence a lot of these darker scenes were cut from the film (probably good due to the film's young audience) but many still remain, enough to make the movie reasonably suspenseful, and with more bite than a typical Disney film (quite literally).The orchestral score is as beautiful as the artwork depicted in the movie, arguably better than the film, though it is often obscured by the sound effects employed. The two elements come together to shroud the world in an air of mystery, adding to the quest-like atmosphere in typical Bluth fashion.The film does stoop to a few predictable elements, such as the character that appears to die dramatically only to return less than a minute later. Littlefoot's mother also dies (no real surprise there) but watching Littlefoot's misery afterward - and little touches, of his wandering footsteps shown from the air following a much larger pair of footsteps in a search for companionship - has the potential to pull your heartstrings, as it did mine.The film tackles the issue of racism that was (aparrently) prominent in America at the time. In the beginning of the film, Littlefoot is prevented from playing with Cera because threehorns never play with longnecks. Cera heeds her father's (poor) advice, but only by working with Littlefoot are the group able to reach their goals. It's nice to see a film with underlying messages like this. Modern films, like The Lion King, though good, are rather hollow in that aspect (though I hear many children now fear their uncles). The Land Before Time will teach younger children that they'll do far better if they put pride and discrimination behind them. Doing so in a humanistic fashion is more than tolerable considering the film's audience.All the characters in LBT are colourful but Littlefoot is the most likable (in this writer's opinion). While re-viewing this film after so many years, it was interesting to see the obvious emergence of his ability to lead. Though he is a child, when hiding from Sharptooth, he directs Cera's movement to prevent their discovery. He soon becomes the deferred leader of the group, mostly because he's the only one who knows how to reach the great valley, but also because he's a genuinely motivating and kind character, without being repulsive in an over-sweet manner.There is SOMETHING missing from the film however, possibly exactly what Don Bluth has commented on when he mentions his own dissatisfaction. The film ends after a measly 69 minutes (due to all the cuts), and as a child I was always wanted more. I am no different as an adult, the only difference is I now turn to the internet rather than rewinding the film and starting again. Something just isn't satisfying in the Land Before Time. That might be why so many sequels were spawned, and though they're entertaining for younger children, with singing and adventures and reasonably-tolerable dialogue, they don't have the darkness, that makes the light at the end of the tunnel that much brighter.

The only difference is I probably won't watch it twice a week for the next two years.The Land Before Time tells a simple story of a dinosaur named Littlefoot, who loses his mother to the deliciously one-dimensional, gravity-defying, vicious tyrannosaur known as Sharptooth. Together with four other lost dinosaurs he searches for the Great Valley, but is slowed by the group's lack of cooperation or trust for one another. The must overcome their personal differences - and the ever-prowling Sharptooth - to reach their goal, and choose to do things the right way, even if that means choosing the hard way.For a movie that suffered so much during its production phase, and one which left the producers and directors dissatisfied, its a wonder LBT underwent the success it did at the box office. Don Bluth delights in making cartoons that are both dark and heartwarming, and LBT is no different. The characters will scream and shiver in fear as Sharptooth prowls around their hiding spot, but in other scenes they laugh and interact as would 'normal' children. Due to Spielberg's influence a lot of these darker scenes were cut from the film (probably good due to the film's young audience) but many still remain, enough to make the movie reasonably suspenseful, and with more bite than a typical Disney film (quite literally).The orchestral score is as beautiful as the artwork depicted in the movie, arguably better than the film, though it is often obscured by the sound effects employed. The two elements come together to shroud the world in an air of mystery, adding to the quest-like atmosphere in typical Bluth fashion.The film does stoop to a few predictable elements, such as the character that appears to die dramatically only to return less than a minute later. Littlefoot's mother also dies (no real surprise there) but watching Littlefoot's misery afterward - and little touches, of his wandering footsteps shown from the air following a much larger pair of footsteps in a search for companionship - has the potential to pull your heartstrings, as it did mine.The film tackles the issue of racism that was (aparrently) prominent in America at the time. In the beginning of the film, Littlefoot is prevented from playing with Cera because threehorns never play with longnecks. Cera heeds her father's (poor) advice, but only by working with Littlefoot are the group able to reach their goals. It's nice to see a film with underlying messages like this. Modern films, like The Lion King, though good, are rather hollow in that aspect (though I hear many children now fear their uncles). The Land Before Time will teach younger children that they'll do far better if they put pride and discrimination behind them.

This is an amazing, powerful film.One could quickly classify this as a film that deals with racism, but that is a misconception. American History X is about hate, and one man's journey from having it rule his life to realizing how pointless it is.Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) was the poster-boy for a white supremacist gang in California. Things changed after he was sent to prison for murder, and now he's trying to prevent his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from going down the same path.American History X is like the ultimate persuasive speech, both in what it achieves and how it's constructed. This powerful film tackles a complex and relevant subject head-on. But its construction as a piece of skilled rhetoric is genius. There's the set-up, addressing of both sides of the issue, then finally the explanation of the point that it wants to make. Director Tony Kaye deftly handles the material so that the subject matter, rather than directorial flair, is what hammers in the point. And he uses enough subtlety to make American History X seem more like a film than a piece of rhetoric.What makes this film work so well is that it seeks to UNDERSTAND both sides of the issue. It doesn't humanize people who hate, and it certainly doesn't expect the audience to sympathize with them, but it explains why they hate. This makes for a more compelling argument because it allows for a more finely-tuned rebuttal. The fact that the skinheads, at least Derek Vinyard, are allowed to sound intelligent, gives a fresh look on an argument that if done any other way would give this film a been there, done that kind of feel.Additionally, it gives insight into the sources of hate and how people like the skinheads become the frontrunners of such feelings. It offers a number of origins and introduces them in a number of ways.This film wouldn't be as compelling and powerful had it not been for a cast filled with superior performances. Edward Norton received an Oscar nod for this role, and he earned it. This is easily his best performance. His character has a wide, dramatic arc and Norton never loses sight of the character. Edward Furlong is impressive as Danny. Furlong has been almost off the map since his star-making debut opposite Arnold Schwartzenegger and Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2 Judgment Day. Here he makes it clear that he hasn't grown out of his acting ability. Beverly D'Angelo shows that she can act off of someone other than Chevy Chase (and in a hard-hitting drama, no less). Stacy Keach is suitably creepy and vile as Cameron, the man who helped Derek with his rise to god status amongst the skinheads, but Keach wisely never goes over the top. Elliot Gould, Fairuza Balk and Ethan Suplee (in an unexpectedly fine performance) are all in good form here.The one person who gets no praise but deserves much is Avery Brooks. He's brilliant and at times equal to Norton. He fills the mentor role, but he knows this is not supposed to be a gentle performance a la Robin Williams in Dead Poet's Society (no ill-will towards Williams' role in that film); he's gritty and forceful and he fits right in. It's a shame that he didn't get an Oscar nod for his performance.According to IMDb, director Tony Kaye claimed that Edward Norton altered the film so much to give himself an Oscar nod for his performance that Kaye wanted his name to be replaced by Humpty Dumpty. He filed a $275 million lawsuit against the Director's Guild and New Line Cinema when he wasn't allowed to remove his name. Be that as it may, at least the result was not the disaster that usually happens to a film that suffers from too much interference from someone OTHER than the director. It's hard to imagine this film being any better. Still, it would be interesting to see the director's cut of the film (the deleted scenes aren't much help in guessing what Kaye's original vision was, as they're mostly the sort of throwaway scenes that had a reason for being left on the cutting room floor).While I respect Kaye's decision for wanting his name removed, having been left with his name on the film is not exactly a bad thing. In fact, his work is amazing. The scenes from Derek's past are shown in black and white (no hint of film noir-style from the oldie films), and the scenes from the present are shown in color. Kaye acted as his own cinematographer, and his skill in both positions is evident.Insightful, provocative, and undeniably powerful, American History X is a brilliant film, and one that needs to be seen.

At least The Shawshank Redemption has me convinced that's the case. This movie is one that does all the little things right and ultimately lets the story do all the talking--a story of hope and finding meaning, purpose and motivation in life or sometimes quite frankly, to live.Writer and director Frank Darabont, who is the unquestioned king of adapting Stephen King prison stories and turning them into touching motion pictures, debuts here as a director who has an understanding of when to leave excessive artistic tinkering out of a film. Having created this outstanding screenplay, the script and the images flow seamlessly together throughout this film, so much that even the big moments feel naturally styled. He uses dark and light contrasts and some repetitive images to create a slightly fluctuating monotony to the prison life and those are the only tricks.The story is that of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), convicted to Shawshank Prison in the opening minutes of the film to life x2 for the murder of his wife and her lover. The film then shifts to the narrative of Red (Morgan Freeman) who has been a con at Shawshank since he was very young. While the film focuses on what happens to Andy in this vortex of inhumanity, what you don't realize is how the story is really about Red and what Andy makes him realize. Andy is a smart and clever guy and most of the first hour of the film is about how he brings some humanity to the prison and a mentality that is not common in a place with guys serving life terms.Robbins was definitely ripped off on an Oscar nod. Its not that he blows you away with his dramatic skills, but it's that as you watch him you never once question his integrity as a character. Sometimes being that believable should be worthy of an Oscar, not just over- dramatic talents or actors playing unique roles. Freeman, however, gets his nod and that was also deserved. If I could have anyone narrate my life, it would be Freeman.The second hour of the film turns it into a bit of a thriller as the warden (Bob Gunton) turns corrupt and begins to test Andy's limits. While many films do this, what makes Shawshank special is that you figure things out just as they are about to happen, which is satisfying. It's not too early that you think it stupid, but it doesn't come out of nowhere either. This hour of the film picks up the pace and brings it from just a depiction of prison life to something special and it's crucial to making the film as enjoyable as it is.Shawshank is not one of my favorite films, but it's the kind of film I could stop and watch every time it's on TV just because of its prevailing positive attitude. While it is so dark, it is so positive and motivating as it give the benefit of the doubt to those who do wrong. It's unforgiving, but then it becomes redeeming. The way it makes you conform to a prisoner's confined mindset and takes you out into the real world in just snippets that seem just eye- opening like the scenes in the grocery store can give you a whole other perspective on life. That and the script just writes itself out exactly as you know it should. Rarely does a film leave you as satisfied as this one does. While it might not be an artistic masterpiece of cinema, it is truly one of the greatest stories Hollywood has ever told.

The two movies are very different. The mobsters in 'Godfather' are dignified by comparison. Those in 'Goodfellas' have practically been driven mad by power, money, and eventually, dope. At least one of them, Joe Pesci's Tommy, is quite literally insane. The film moves at a lightning pace, narration provided by the character Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco.) We see what takes places through Henry's (and to lesser degree, Karen's) descriptions, though it plays out right in front of us as well. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy, a charismatic gangster who is part of the mob but also something of a free agent; he can never be 'made' (the ultimate distinction the crime family can bestow on a member) because of his Irish roots. The same goes for Henry. He earns his place in the mob by starting at an early age as an errand boy willing to do anything, which endears him to the mob and their boss, Paulie. The violence in 'Goodfellas' is all the more appalling because for the most part, it is so casually administered. Tommy, for example, will kill anyone for the slightest perceived insult, with no more thought or regret than he would have ordering a drink. People are routinely beaten up savagely if they get crossways with any of the mob figures. But there is much more to the film than that, and I should point out there's a great deal of humor in the film, some of it laugh-out-loud funny. At times, it's like the most twisted comedy you've ever seen. 'Goodfellas' also shows how this 'community' of criminals and their families live; it takes place in and around New York City for the most part. Not surprisingly, it is a very tightly-knit group. Once Karen marries Henry, she has no contacts or life outside the extended 'family.' All of her female friends are wives of other mobsters. Birthdays, weddings, holidays... these are only shared with family insiders. This quirky little subculture has its own rules, standards and perks. For instance, there is one night a week designated for the men to take their mistresses out for drinks at a nightclub. Serving a prison term is accepted with a shrug; it seems almost all the men have served time at one point or another. Henry's first prison stint gets him congratulations from the others. It's like a badge of honor or a rite of passage. The lifestyle is very fast-paced, almost maniacally so. Everyone the mobsters deal with is paid off with wads of cash cops, delivery boys, waiters, prison guards, you name it. Every gangster in the family carries with him a roll of hundreds (occasionally twenties); I've never seen so much currency exchange hands so frequently as in 'Goodfellas.' Eventually, despite Paulie's prohibition against it, several of the men including Henry begin dealing in drugs, specifically cocaine, which he and Karen are soon hooked on. The final scenes show a paranoid, out of control Henry totally wired from the coke, backed into a corner, the only way out being to turn government informant and enter the witness protection program. Turns out old Don Corleone, in that very different film 'The Godfather,' was right. Drugs did end up destroying the mob to a large degree. 'Goodfellas' shows that, but what an insane thrill ride it must have been... like a roller-coaster going a thousand miles an hour straight down into hell.
