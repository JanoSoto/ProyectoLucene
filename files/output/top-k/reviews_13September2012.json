As the investigation proceeds a group of suspects emerges; all of whom served in Vietnam at the same time.This is a decent enough film but if you removed the unnecessary romance between Austin and Donna and some of the excessive banter the remaining mystery wouldn't sustain a one hour TV show! Sean Connery plays Caldwell the way he plays everybody; which isn't really a bad thing as he is an entertaining scene presence; even though I didn't buy that he'd still have that accent if he moved to the States when he was ten! Mark Harmon was OK as Austin although he has nowhere near the screen presence as Connery.

It is mostly set in the same room, which is the warehouse they meet up in after the ambush. Tarantino presented the film so simply that it is representing the genuine position a gang of criminals would be in after being chased by the police following a robbery suspiciously going wrong.

I believe this is very unique to a film that it makes it even more natural and convincing. When I started watching the film for the first time I wasn't sure what to expect. But, from the soundtrack used after the first scene I was expecting a standard robbery that goes down to plan as they are walking down the street looking very confident with an enthusiastic song playing along, this created the image that they know what they are doing and are relaxed about it all.After watching the movie I read some reviews on the film and some said that the violence was a bit unnecessary, I completely disagreed with this as I thought that the violence helped to build upon the characters true personalities as it exposed Mr. Blonde as a genuine psychopath.Overall I would say Reservoir Dogs is a movie you must watch if you haven't done so already.

The film takes the audience through the next few days of Lester's life where he does everything possible to get his life and dignity back after being stuck in a loveless marriage and a job that gives him no satisfaction. Lester's wife, Carolyn Burnham is played by Annette Benning; his daughter Jane is played by Thora Birch; and her friend Angela, who becomes the center of Lester's infatuation is played by Mena Suvari. Each of these actors fits well into their characters and portrays the theme of the film perfectly.The theme of the film is that happiness can be found by looking closer at the things and people around you; seeing people for who they are and material possessions for what they are. This theme is portrayed through the eyes of Lester and is highlighted by the depression he struggles through from the beginning of the film. When Lester finally finds something that in his depressed eyes is worth being happy about, which is Angela, the director focuses on this through the length of the film. To emphasize Lester's direct thoughts when he is fantasizing about Angela there is a change in the sound during that particular scene. During moments of Lester's thoughts the sound includes a few low ambient sounds with a very low tempo. This creates a very surreal feeling that takes the viewer inside the thoughts of Lester.Lester's depression is used as a motif that further emphasizes the overall theme of the film. Without the depression it is unlikely that any of the events would have taken place as Lester likely would have felt much happier in this marriage from the beginning. This is also noticed when viewing the character of Col. Frank Fits, played by Chris Cooper, and his wife Barbara Fits, played by Allison Janney; these two have some obvious problems in their marriage that do not become inherently clear until the end of the film when we find that Frank is gay and has been hiding this his entire life. In doing so he has pushed away both his son and his wife. As with Lester and his family, who could have had a happy marriage if they each could have looked beyond each other's facade and saw who they were inside; so to could Frank and his wife had been happy, even if that meant they were no longer married because he finally admitted he was gay. We see this same scenario present in many films. For example, in Gran Torino, though having a bit of a different theme, we see a character in this film disliking people because of their race, which in turn causes that person great anger; however, toward the end of the film he has seen these people for who they are and enjoys moments of happiness for the first time.

Being dead is rather confusing even when you have the handbook. They soon figure out they can't leave the house and that doesn't seem too bad until the house is sold to the Deetz family. The Maitlands take an instant disliking to Delia Deetz in particular as she sets about deciding what alterations she must have done to make the house habitable. They attempt to scare her and her husband but they can't see them. The only person who can see them is their daughter Lydia Deetz. She tells her parents about the ghosts but obviously they don't believe her... until they put on a show during the middle of a dinner party; far from scaring them off though they think having a haunted house might be an opportunity! The Maitlands seek help, first from their afterlife case worker Juno then from Bio-Exorcist Betelgeuse (pronounced Beetle Juice). He seems more of a danger to them than the Deetz family though!This film is a lot of fun in the slightly dark way one would expect from a Tom Burton film. Michael Keaton puts in a delightfully over the top performance in the title role; having seen this I'm surprised that Burton didn't cast him as The Joker in his 'Batman' film! Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are good as the Maitlands although playing ordinary people (how just happen to be dead) they get less opportunities to show what they can do. Winona Ryder is great as Lydia; one of her earliest roles and probably the one that got her noticed by the film going public. Other notable performances come from Catherine O'Hara and Jeffery Jones as Delia and Charles Deetz and Glenn Shadix who plays Delia's strange decorator\/guru Otho. The film is full of great special effects; no CGI here; just great make-up, stop go animation and puppetry. Burton's regular collaborator Danny Elfman's music fits the film perfectly. The film is definitely a comedy but there are some scary moments and a little bit of swearing that means it might not be suitable for younger children... the film may be rated '15' here in the UK but I suspect if it gets re-certificated one day it will be lowered to '12' given that it is much tamer than many '12' rated films.

The Maitlands take an instant disliking to Delia Deetz in particular as she sets about deciding what alterations she must have done to make the house habitable. They attempt to scare her and her husband but they can't see them. The only person who can see them is their daughter Lydia Deetz. She tells her parents about the ghosts but obviously they don't believe her... until they put on a show during the middle of a dinner party; far from scaring them off though they think having a haunted house might be an opportunity! The Maitlands seek help, first from their afterlife case worker Juno then from Bio-Exorcist Betelgeuse (pronounced Beetle Juice). He seems more of a danger to them than the Deetz family though!This film is a lot of fun in the slightly dark way one would expect from a Tom Burton film. Michael Keaton puts in a delightfully over the top performance in the title role; having seen this I'm surprised that Burton didn't cast him as The Joker in his 'Batman' film! Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are good as the Maitlands although playing ordinary people (how just happen to be dead) they get less opportunities to show what they can do. Winona Ryder is great as Lydia; one of her earliest roles and probably the one that got her noticed by the film going public. Other notable performances come from Catherine O'Hara and Jeffery Jones as Delia and Charles Deetz and Glenn Shadix who plays Delia's strange decorator\/guru Otho. The film is full of great special effects; no CGI here; just great make-up, stop go animation and puppetry. Burton's regular collaborator Danny Elfman's music fits the film perfectly. The film is definitely a comedy but there are some scary moments and a little bit of swearing that means it might not be suitable for younger children... the film may be rated '15' here in the UK but I suspect if it gets re-certificated one day it will be lowered to '12' given that it is much tamer than many '12' rated films.

Wallace really was 'something' on screen, but in private she was unfortunately 'something else'. Her tempestuous private life, drinking, suicide attempts, and apparent general instability meant that she never achieved what she might have done if she had been more stable. The acting is strong in this film, also from Brian Donlevy as an older gangster who has been sidelined, and from a cast of familiar supporting payers such as Earl Holliman, Lee van Cleef, and John Hoyt. Conte plays one of those gangster supremos who doesn't care whom he kills, but his fingerprints are never on anything. Will they, can they, get him? Wilde tries and tries and tries, and it is a most frustrating business trying to pin something on such an elusive crime boss as Conte. Conte's controlled, sneering, sinister menace is most effective.

His craft reveals as much; it strives for controlled perfection, omniscience, monumental depiction, clean boundaries, in every bit the same way as Riefenstahl fought in her films to choreograph the world into her own image of idealized sensuality - confused for spiritual.It's no wonder Coppola was so smitten by this he put his name and money on it, a similarly over-zealous man enthralled (at one point) by 'mystical' nature.Both, by their overly zealous approach to freeze transcendence, reveal in a roundabout way the limitations of the human model criticized here we are at odds with this being an imperfect , chaotic world, so when the film ends with footage of burning space rocket debris cascading from the skies, the notion is not acceptance of the inevitable end of things, but a cautionary lament if only we lived another way, things wouldn't blow up in our face. And there is simply no such way to live, not without skiing on imbalance, which is why life is exciting in the first place.And we all have to live with the fact every single day. The energy world has to daily spend a large amount simply to make-up for turbulent energy loss, because that is nature's way.And isn't it just weird but so revealing at the same time, that human-attempted control over the elements is criticized, by filmmakers who used some of the best film technology had to offer, in order to manipulate the elements and even time itself to enhance impressions of natural purity?

There is a boxer, Butch Coolidge, who is played by Bruce Willis and a gangster, Marcellus Wallace, who is played by Ving Rhames. Butch and Marcellus are conspiring to fix a boxing match so that Marcellus can profit by placing a bet on the match. There is the wife of Marcellus, Mia Wallace, who is played by Uma Thurman and a hit man, Vincent Vega, who is played by John Travolta. While Marcellus is out of town on business Vincent is tasked with entertaining Mia for the evening and they manage to get into trouble. There is Vincent Vega and another hit man, Jules Winfield, who is played by Samuel L. Jackson. Vincent and Jules are tasked with collecting a valuable package on behalf of Marcellus and that turns out to be a very violent encounter.The theme of Pulp Fiction is one reaps what one sows. In several instances main characters that seem to be living a comfortable lifestyle get involved in some risky behavior and each of them ended up suffering dire consequences as a result. A motif which is repeated in Pulp Fiction is the bible verse Ezekiel 2517. Over the course of my life I have spent far more time attending church services than I have watching Pulp Fiction, but this motif is so memorable that it has become the only bible verse which I have memorized. The initial citing of the verse was near the beginning of the film and it was told in a vengeful manor. When the same verse was repeated at the very end of the movie the same words told a tale of redemption. The lighting in Pulp Fiction is quite bright through the film. Even in scenes such as a darkened bar or a convertible with the top down at night where one would expect the characters to be cast in shadows they are illuminated to the point where it almost feels as though they are facing a spotlight.There is a significant amount of violent content in Pulp Fiction and the entire story revolves around characters engaging in illegal conduct. Despite those facts there is a definite comedic sense which emanates from the film. Some of the violent scenes were so outrageous and over the top that I found myself reacting as though I was watching a cartoon where Yosemite Sam was firing a shotgun at Bugs Bunny. It doesn't get much more violent than firing a gun in the direction of another being but the audience tends to laugh it off because the action is clearly not real.Another movie which intertwines the separate stories of people engaging in criminal activity is Heat. Heat was directed by Michael Mann and was released in 1995. Unlike the over the top violence in Pulp Fiction, Heat has a tone which is quite serious, and it is realistic to the point where the viewer feels as though they could be watching a live portrayal of actual events.
