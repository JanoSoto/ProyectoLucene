Happily, it was, and I wasn't. Although it lacks the satirical bite and philosophical reach of Harold and Maude, the cult '70s romantic comedy to which There's Something About Mary traces its roots and pays repeated homage, this Farrelly brothers effort shares the earlier film's genre-bending spirit, shockingly iconoclastic images, and sharply written dialog - not to mention its sidesplitting hilarity.At least a half dozen scenes in There's Something About Mary still rank among the funniest I've ever encountered on film and set me off once again into uncontrollable laugh convulsions, even minus the stimulus of a roaring theater audience around me. The list must naturally begin with the prom night frank and beans in the zipper scene. Even more than the outrageousness of the central physical source of humor, what makes the scene work so spectacularly well is its pacing and the facial reactions of the various characters who enter the bathroom to observe Ted's embarrassed agony. One thing I had forgotten about the scene (or didn't notice the first time around) was how much it owes to the classic Marx Brothers' stateroom scene in A Night at the Opera. In fact, I was rather surprised while listening to the Farrelly brothers' alternate soundtrack commentary that they did not mention a Marx Brothers influence either specifically on this scene or on their brand of comedy in general.The film's other humorous high-points (if that's the right word), certainly include the three dog sequences (Puffy in a sedative coma\/Puffy on speed\/Puffy in a body cast), the hitchhiker sequence and its follow-up interrogation at police headquarters, the infamous hair gel scene, and old flame Woogie's sexual assault on Mary's closet. That these are not the sorts of subjects we feel entirely comfortable having jokes based on is precisely what makes them work so well - when they work for us at all that is. Operating on the edges of moral and social taboo the Farrelly brothers deliberately risk offense and invite charges of bad taste. Not surprisingly, therefore, almost everyone will respond to some attempts at humor in There's Something About Mary with more discomfort than elation. In addition, some comic bits in the film don't work simply because they were ill conceived or poorly acted, the leaden entry and presence of Brett Favre in the film's final scene being one such instance in my view and the whole pizza delivery boy character being another.For the most part, though, things click together in There's Something About Mary with a magical charm that few American screwball comedies have ever achieved. Much of the credit for that success must be attributed not only to the clever script but to the wonderful casting\/acting of Ben Stiller as the lovable schlemiel Ted Stroehmann, Cameron Diaz as the luminous dream girl Mary, and Matt Dillon as the goofy gumshoe and romantic rival Pat Healy. Chris Elliott as the stressed out fetishist\/stalker Woogie and Lin Shave as Mary's Maude-like neighbor Magda also add greatly to the film's comic chemistry - as does the film's musical score, which cleverly uses the Mel Brooks device of giving background musicians an on screen presence and concludes with a full cast encore lip-syncing to Build Me Up Buttercup as the end credits roll and outtakes flash by.

Kevin Costner leads an excellent cast, all of which provide great performances as we explore a little talked about side of one of the most important events in US History.Costner plays Jim Garrison a New Orleans District Attorney who watched in horror as President Kennedy was shot.  As he investigates some unusual happenings related to accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald who was a resident of New Orleans.  What he uncovers is a big conspiracy that reaches to many corners of the globe.The first thing that pops out at you is the tremendous cast they have here. Back when Costner was one of the worlds most popular leading men he was the leader in a cast that included Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Sissy Spacek, Ed Asner, Donald Sutherland, John Candy, and appearances by many other stars that were mostly walk-ons.But attention should be paid to the character actors in this movie as well. People like Pruitt Taylor Vince, Vincent D'Onofrio, Jay O. Sanders and Michael Rooker are excellent.  But special attention should be paid to Wayne Knight who played Newman on Seinfeld.  He does an excellent job here. Tommy Lee Jones is in the movie was nominated for an Oscar.  His part was very small but it is good.Oliver Stone gives an entirely different angle to the Kennedy assassination. I must give my respect to a man that can have the Kennedy assassination involve homosexual prostitutes, communist revolutionaries, former Nazi's and most of all Texas, the state where three presidents came from in the last forty years, home to some of the biggest businesses in the world, such as the defense industry and the oil industry and who you will see in this film had a lot to do with Kennedy's assassination.This is an excellent movie.  In three hours Oliver Stone has made a powerful story that keeps you on the edge of your seat for three hours.  Kevin Costner is an excellent lead to the brilliant cast.  There was not one moment that I was bored in this movie.  This is just an amazing film and an amazing and disturbing vision of the Kennedy assassination and a strange portrait of America.I believe Stone's story.  There is just too much that happened that day in November of 1963 not to believe something did not happened in Dallas.  I like this movie if for no other reason it puts so many myths and facts in perspective and present a clear story of what happened.  I like how Stone presents a clear flavor for the time as well.  Stone does an all around excellent job in making this movie.  This movie works as a historical document, a dramatic film a courtroom drama, and as a thriller.  This is a great movie experience all around.If you watch this movie be sure to get the directors cut.  The theatrical release was good but watch the director's cut.  That has John Larroquette in it.  The movie is good because it walks the fine line between being dramatic and being preachy and it does a good job of finding that balance.

I, however, couldn't wait to read the book after seeing this film. I've read the book 5 times since and seen the movie more times than I can remember. Simply put, this movie changed my life. Not just on a personal level (on which I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan) but also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors. This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man. David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got was so much, much more. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the depth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile imaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the clichés but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen.

Not just on a personal level (on which I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan) but also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors. This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man. David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got was so much, much more. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the depth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile imaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the clichés but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen.

Yes, you could argue that it has propagandist tendencies, but that is just a hazard of the genre, even with the most well-meaning films.  Yes, the emphasis on 19 American dead seems rather disproportionate to the 1000-odd Somali dead; but then, the film is the story of the US soldiers, not the Somalis.  It is told from a Western perspective, and it is entirely natural that the story - which is in any case an adaptation of a book - should focus on the US forces.  Critics with an anti-American agenda should perhaps note that not only did an Englishman direct this film, but it features two Scots, a Welshman and a couple of Kiwis in significant roles as US servicemen.One of the primary intentions of this film appears to be to relate events as they happened.  That is, the film is not about what is good, or what is bad, but simply what IS - was, I should say.  In this the film appears to be reasonably succesful, conveying the chaos of modern battle in a way that I can imagine is very realistic.  (Not that I'd know.)This does not excuse the film's many flaws. I shuddered a little when I saw Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore and Ewen Bremner all together again - not that any of these three is an unwelcome presence on screen, far from it - but rather that I was immediately reminded of Pearl Harbour - a film which presents the viewer with an operatic mythologising of warfare and real events, comparisons with which Black Hawk Down would truly be best served by avoiding.This was not helped by moments such as when a soldier rips a cast from his arm in hyper-macho fashion, or when a dying soldier actually says 'Tell my mom I done ma best', or words unbearably similar to that old cliche.  These may well be real for all I know, but in the context of a film which has pretensions to seriousness, they simply feel crude and obvious.I actually went into this film expecting to enjoy it - I enjoyed nonsense like Pearl Harbour, and my expectations of a Bruckheimer film had led me to believe that whatever its flaws I could enjoy BHD.  Tragically, BHD commits the greatest sin for an action film - it isn't actually very exciting.  This strikes me as a terrible shame as the story really is a gripping one, and a BBC documentary of a few years ago conveyed this very well.  However, the battle scenes in this film are, if anything, almost too routine.  As an exercise in verisimilitude it is a technical feat to behold; and yet, there is a feeling of detachment from the events.  Perhaps it's the blandness of the characters, perhaps because they're TOO real, but there's a feeling of general anonymity about this bunch of bald guys that I haven't really felt in a cast since Alien 3.  Only Eric Bana really is memorable as the quiet soldier who demonstrably knows his job.And what does the film actually give us in its discussion of war (if discussion it is)?  There is a good moment concerning an accidental shooting, another concerning the simple bad luck that can befall a soldier before he even sees battle, and an appropriately horrible scene with a wounded soldier... but these are perfunctory and even that last is undercut by the dialogue which is stilted and cliched.I suppose ultimately this film provokes indifference in me.  It's difficult to enjoy as an action movie because it's too serious.  It's difficult to appreciate as a 'serious' war movie because it's not quite serious enough.  If anything, it's like playing a computer game... and that's not the feeling I would like a film about armed conflict to provoke in me.

Bob Hoskins' portrayal of Harold Shands, boss of London, ranks with Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Edward G. Robinson, Jimmy Cagney, Rober De Niro or Joe Pesci. He epitomizes the screen gangster, with colorful language, an explosive temper, street smarts, but a vulnerability that is not always seen in other gangster roles. His wife, played by Helen Mirren, is tough in her own way, yet never loses her feminine touch. However, we sense they're both haunted by demons, as if they know some day they'll pay the ultimate price for their misdeeds. Razors, or as the youth of the day call him, The Human Spirograph, is one of the most menacing bodyguards I've ever seen.The accents are a bit hard to understand at points to those of us here in the US ('ands across the ocean!), but it adds to the authenticity and helps make this movie stand out from the typical Hollywood gangster film. I do share other criticisms of the dated early 80's music, but it helps to place the movie in the period where it takes place.Harold can't accept that those who seek to remove him play by a different set of rules and are motivated not by criminal aspirations as he is, but by politics and ideology. This is admittedly an oversimplification of a very complex situation, but it helps explain why he's destined to fail in a world that's changing beyond the limits he's been comfortable with for years.I saw this movie on its first run in San Francisco, bought the tape when it became available, and now have it on DVD. It's still my favorite Hoskins role. If you get a chance, watch out for George Harrison's comments on this movie. His company, Handmade Films, produced it, and he stated he wouldn't have accepted the project had he known how violent it would turn out to be. The violence, however, isn't gratuitous.
