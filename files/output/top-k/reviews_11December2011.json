The story was already adapted into the classic 1966 television special featuring Boris Karloff the Uncanny. How does it hold up compared to these and other Christmas movies? Not particularly well.To say something nice first, the film looks great. If ever you wanted to see a Dr. Seuss book come to life, this is it. The set design is terrific. The blend of miniatures and computer generated imagery is fantastic to the point where stuff looks very convincing. The make-up effects were good enough to win an Oscar.Jim Carrey does a great job. He obviously is having fun with the role, getting to play as over the top as he wants. His usual silly improvisation works well with the role. He also does very well in the make-up, able to perform many facial expressions that don't look real. That one iconic grin appearing to be digitally enhanced, though it wasn't. And once the movie gets to the book\/special parts where the Grinch is actually stealing Christmas, Carrey shines and makes the movie incredibly fun.The rest of the cast is okay. They are all overplayed bordering on camp, but I guess that was what Ron Howard was going for. Taylor Momsen does a decent job in her first starring role, but Cindy Lou is portrayed as far too over-the-top sweet. Every scene she's in seems to punch you in the face with how sweet she is and how cute she looks. Anthony Hopkins is fantastic as the narrator, but he's got such a good voice he could make the phone book sound interesting. This is about where the good stuff ends.The TV special had directly adapted the book, so to turn it into a full length feature extra content had to be added. Some is welcome, most is not. I do like how they expanded on the relationship between the Grinch and Whoville since the original story did not have much. The concept of why the Grinch hates Christmas is good in theory but the way it was done was lousy. The whole Made fun of as a kid thing has been done dozens of times before and doesn't help the original story's true message (more on that later). The entire Whobilation sequence is dumb, tedious, and seems to exist only to fill up space. Howard had some fun and Carrey got to be silly but it hardly helps the plot in anyway. You can skip past it and not miss anything.Ron Howard is mostly known for his dramatic movies. Backdraft, Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Frost\/Nixon, and even Parenthood was more of a dramatic movie with comedic elements. And he seems out of his element by doing this campy, silly style. He would have done better with a dramedy like Parenthood. But this just isn't his style and it shows. Other directors can pull off camp with style but Howard, like Spielberg, is better suited for drama with comedy added.The biggest problem with the movie is that it completely reverses the message of the original story. Originally, the Grinch didn't understand the true meaning of Christmas and it was the Whos who made him see the truth. In this movie, the Whos are over-commercialized gluttons who only care about material things and it is Grinch who makes them see the truth. What? Did the producers ever even read the book or watch the special? Didn't anyone involved ever say, Hey, you got this backwards.? The reason the Grinch is a grinch is supposed to be because he just sees the material things and thinks that's all there is. Later, he realizes that stuff was only a representation of feelings. Here the Whos are all self-centered jerks, except for overly sweet Cindy Lou, who represent all the negative things about the Christmas season until the finale. As with any adaptation, fans will tolerate any change as long as the spirit stays true to the source. But this movie was not faithful to what Seuss was trying to say. If the movie had just stuck to the original story and just expanded on Grinch's misconceptions about the season, the movie would have done very well. After all, he's supposed to be the hero and villain whereas here he is simply this green goofball doing random things up until he actually performs the title deed.Children will probably enjoy the silly antics and goofy setting. Though my little brother (who was three when the movie came out but I don't remember when he did see it) was terrified of the Grinch for years after seeing the movie because Carrey can be intense for the younger ones. Adults will probably find the story to be dumb and full of fluff. Fans will enjoy how Carrey performs the role but may find the story to be too drastically changed. If you're looking for a good Christmas movie, there's plenty better about finding the true meaning of Christmas. Plus the classic TV special is readily available wherever this movie is sold.

In a bar, in front of a loud mouth bimbo. A top secret program. Chuck Yeager says, fine, he'll do it. They say, see you tomorrow. And the next day, Yeager hops in a plane he's never flown before, without any instructions, and off he goes to Mach 1.Now, what's wrong with this picture, class? Answer Everything. It's not historically accurate, and it's not even plausible. This is history according to Philip Kaufman. This sets the tone for The Right Stuff. Clearly, the director ain't gonna sweat the details, historic or scientific. I'll leave it to others to catalogue the long list of historical inaccuracies in this movie. The best reason to watch The Right Stuff is to see Chuck Yeager serve the actor playing Scott Crossfield his steak dinner for breaking Mach 2. Chuck Yeager is a class act, a natural pilot and a great human being. Read his memoirs. They say the reason he didn't get chosen to be a pilot was because they wanted only college graduates. But I think the real reason Yeager didn't get it was because they couldn't afford to lose such a great American hero. Also, born in 1923, he would have been in his 40s during the program.Let's face it, these astronauts had to be expendable; like stock car racers, the real excitement was because they might die. And that's why John Glenn wasn't allowed in the Apollo program; he wasn't expendable, anymore.The actors playing the astronauts and they're wives did a fine job, considering we had seen the real ones on TV. But most of the other acting was cheesy, which I blame on the directing style, which interjected too much forced humor into the middle section. Harry Shearer, I love ya, but you and Jeff Goldblum ham it up too much. And why must the press by portrayed as a pack of laughing hyenas and jackals?You shouldn't mistake this movie for historical fact. Just look at the trivia section to see how much is bull, including Yeager's flight at the end. I hope it will at least get people interested in exploring the events through the internet, books and documentaries. One of the worst parts of the movie is the nasty insinuations about Gus Grissom, which are not borne out by historical fact. Sure, a Hollywood movie is for entertainment purposes only, but this is a cheap shot. This movie could have been a great historical epic, but it falls far short. When you are dealing with history, especially within living memory, the acting should be much better than this, more realistic and believable. It should feel real, and as powerful as the events it portrays. Sadly, with all the exaggeration, it just doesn't feel genuine. Certainly, this is not American patriotic propaganda, especially considering how unflattering it is. I don't see the space program as an American thing, but as a great accomplishment by humans, something all of us can be proud of, regardless of nationality. On the other hand, did they really have to put Russian music over the scene after the astronauts say they are tired of being beaten by the Russians, and we see them in their space suits walking down a corridor? I like Tchaikovsky as much as the next guy. But the Russians seeing this now must find it hilarious that the soundtrack should use a blatant knock off of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto as patriotic background music for the American space program!The music soundtrack is surprisingly weak, what with the Tchaikovsky ripoff, followed by an even less subtle ripoff of Holst's The Planets, hardly an original concept for a movie about space. But there is also an original theme by Bill Conti that is quite good. Yet there is no flow or unity to the development of the music, just patches of this theme or that dropped into the picture. After watching this, see the first episode of Quantum Leap, if you can; it is actually better done than the movie. Also consider reading Packing for Mars, by Mary Roach, and Riding Rockets, by Mike Mulane.Sadly, the more you know about the real story, the worse The Right Stuff -- the movie -- looks. I am not in the least surprised this didn't win the Academy Award for best picture; the pros can tell schlock when they see it. The movie construction is just plain sloppy, with tons of continuity errors and a mishmash soundtrack that is mostly Russian and British inspired. If NASA had been as sloppy as this movie, most of the space flights would have crashed and burned. The movie is not as great as many here say. I suppose it is still worth watching once, especially the early scenes with Chuck Yeager playing the bartender, and eavesdropping as the suits badmouth Chuck Yeager! But it is sad that the movie has come to replace reality in the minds of so many viewers. And for that reason, I recommend against watching The Right Stuff.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, History"},{"date":"11 December 2011","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" In the opening, we see some suits trying to hire a test pilot to fly the X-15 to break the sound barrier. In a bar, in front of a loud mouth bimbo. A top secret program. Chuck Yeager says, fine, he'll do it. They say, see you tomorrow. And the next day, Yeager hops in a plane he's never flown before, without any instructions, and off he goes to Mach 1.Now, what's wrong with this picture, class? Answer Everything. It's not historically accurate, and it's not even plausible. This is history according to Philip Kaufman. This sets the tone for The Right Stuff. Clearly, the director ain't gonna sweat the details, historic or scientific. I'll leave it to others to catalogue the long list of historical inaccuracies in this movie. The best reason to watch The Right Stuff is to see Chuck Yeager serve the actor playing Scott Crossfield his steak dinner for breaking Mach 2. Chuck Yeager is a class act, a natural pilot and a great human being. Read his memoirs. They say the reason he didn't get chosen to be a pilot was because they wanted only college graduates. But I think the real reason Yeager didn't get it was because they couldn't afford to lose such a great American hero. Also, born in 1923, he would have been in his 40s during the program.Let's face it, these astronauts had to be expendable; like stock car racers, the real excitement was because they might die. And that's why John Glenn wasn't allowed in the Apollo program; he wasn't expendable, anymore.The actors playing the astronauts and they're wives did a fine job, considering we had seen the real ones on TV. But most of the other acting was cheesy, which I blame on the directing style, which interjected too much forced humor into the middle section. Harry Shearer, I love ya, but you and Jeff Goldblum ham it up too much. And why must the press by portrayed as a pack of laughing hyenas and jackals?You shouldn't mistake this movie for historical fact. Just look at the trivia section to see how much is bull, including Yeager's flight at the end. I hope it will at least get people interested in exploring the events through the internet, books and documentaries. One of the worst parts of the movie is the nasty insinuations about Gus Grissom, which are not borne out by historical fact. Sure, a Hollywood movie is for entertainment purposes only, but this is a cheap shot. This movie could have been a great historical epic, but it falls far short. When you are dealing with history, especially within living memory, the acting should be much better than this, more realistic and believable. It should feel real, and as powerful as the events it portrays. Sadly, with all the exaggeration, it just doesn't feel genuine. Certainly, this is not American patriotic propaganda, especially considering how unflattering it is. I don't see the space program as an American thing, but as a great accomplishment by humans, something all of us can be proud of, regardless of nationality. On the other hand, did they really have to put Russian music over the scene after the astronauts say they are tired of being beaten by the Russians, and we see them in their space suits walking down a corridor? I like Tchaikovsky as much as the next guy. But the Russians seeing this now must find it hilarious that the soundtrack should use a blatant knock off of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto as patriotic background music for the American space program!The music soundtrack is surprisingly weak, what with the Tchaikovsky ripoff, followed by an even less subtle ripoff of Holst's The Planets, hardly an original concept for a movie about space. But there is also an original theme by Bill Conti that is quite good. Yet there is no flow or unity to the development of the music, just patches of this theme or that dropped into the picture. After watching this, see the first episode of Quantum Leap, if you can; it is actually better done than the movie. Also consider reading Packing for Mars, by Mary Roach, and Riding Rockets, by Mike Mulane.Sadly, the more you know about the real story, the worse The Right Stuff -- the movie -- looks.

I will TRY and keep this brief (impossible), but this is one of my all-time favourite films and for good reason. The same way I have given Lord of the Rings the title of my favourite fantasy adventure movie, Star Wars the Sci-Fi favourite, and so on and so on, is the same way I put this among my top-ten of comedies ever. The duo of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels is one of the best comedy match-ups since John Candy and Steve Martin. Both are dumb as each other in equally dumb ways but this truly is NOT a dumb movie. It's heart-warming, ridiculous and it's a proper journey of friendship and male-bonding. I won't go into the plot, but imagine the best road trip you could ever go on with your best mate, filled with memories you will never soon forget (for better or worse). THAT is this film.The comedic timing is perfect. The choreography captures the scenery beautifully as they trawl from Rhode Island to Aspen, and I don't think the Farrelly brothers have ever made a film as great as this. I mean, the humour is perfect. The crass and gross moments aren't tastelessly done like in something like American Pie or some teen flick, this is smart yet incredibly thick! If you don't cry laughing at the kind of scrapes these two get themselves into, you've dislocated your funny bone. And serious applause is due to Daniels who isn't overshadowed by Carrey. As a big Carrey fan, I've never found anyone as funny or able to pull off dumb and wacky humour the way he is, but Daniels is the only person I've ever seen who works in perfect harmony with him, and with Jim being the big man of comedy himself, that is no easy feat. Daniels, I truly commend you for that. He confessed he never did a film like this, ever. And for someone I will always remember for Arachnophobia, he was outstanding and I could not imagine a better casting choice. A real shocker of a role for him, but acted flawlessly.

It shows us events that could happen in real life that does not physical happens in real life. Magical incident but are not acknowledge in real life. It shows us that something extraordinary can happen in our everyday life. What I loved about this movie is that you do not know where the movie is taking you, because the movie itself does not follow a formula. It does have different genres, it first starts of with a humor. Then it takes a turn to a more seriously genres that eventually turns into tragedy. The film represent its own rule, it defined its own logical frame. It does not have the typical happy ending. If you look at another point of view you could see that the movie ends the same way it started with the wedding and a orphan kid. Another thing that I would like to point out is how Kuturica the director shows us how the other characters in the movie build the character of Perhan. You get to see the unconditional love from his grandmother. She is the moral center in the movie. She brings out the moral and reminds him of how good he use to be, a grandmothers boy. From Azra his wife, he felt betrayed because he thought she was carrying someone else child. His sister Danira brings hope to him. Perhan also felt betrayal from Ahmed that he in a way saw as a father figure. Kuturica made us think that the first Perhan dream of the river sequence, where he imagine getting married to Azra is just imagination, a dream. The amazing thing about this scene is that the director gives us reason to believe that it might not just be a dream nor a imagination, when Azra burns herself under her breast. We get to see her to it again on their wedding night when Perhan rejects her. By Azra writing Perhan's name with burn marks makes the river scene real or felt real. I Love that Kuturica is twisting our minds. This proves the magical realism. What Kuturica is trying to say is that imagining feels real, to imagine is real. There is definitely a theme of self sacrifice is this movie. When Perhan returns to his village and finds Azra pregnant it turns him into a mean bastard. He brings her to Rome and he treats her badly saying things like give birth to your child so I can sell him. The self sacrifice that helps Perhan become human again is when Azra dies giving birth to the child and seeing her hovering in the air made him realize that the child was his. One again this movie has truly a powerful storytelling, it is so beautiful, spiritual and tragic. The music is very moving and amazing. It is so beautiful that it fills you with so much mixed emotion. I definitely recommend this movie for people to see. I feel sorry for these children. When someone rich from their village come and visit them, the poor believes that if the children goes with them they'll have that wonderful life they've always wanted, but it just gets worse. It breaks my heart. For Emir Kuturica to make the character Perhan tolerate and bear with awfulness to collect enough money for his grandmother and sister takes courage and I loved that.

Along with several other war tributes to the generation that served our country during the 1940s, Fuller's version is another good film to see.Starring as the main character is Lee Marvin. For anyone who does not know of Marvin's background, he too served in the military in World War II. And now he's fighting for his country again but on screen; where he can't be really killed. Lucky him! Along side Marvin is actor Mark Hamill. Yes-Luke Skywalker is in this movie too! Now America has the force on its side! Hamill plays a character named Griff who is a little bit insecure about himself. He's the kind of person that does not acclimate to war so easily but tries to cope with it. The main things that will grab people's attention are the accuracy of what most of the war was like. Everything was grueling. Everything was communicated by hollering orders. Everything was at war. There are not a lot of characters involved with the plot but you see many brave soldiers die; no doubt about that.There are also some touching moments in this film.

Denzel Washington got the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Glory--even though I felt that Morgan Freeman did a better job in this film. On top of that, Freeman had also turned in a masterful performance this same year in Driving Miss Daisy. Now I am not putting down Washington's acting--he was fine. But to me, it was more Freeman's film and he stood out furthest among this nice ensemble cast.The biggest reasons I liked the movie so much were because it had a deeper message than just war and because it tried to get things right historically. As far as the message goes, it was about racism and black men proving themselves during the Civil War. This was very uplifting and exciting to watch. It also was lovely because as a history teacher, I so often HATE how historical films get all the facts wrong. Here, while it isn't perfect, it is sure close!!

This is a tale of a mother and daughter and all the struggles that their lives encounter both together and apart. I loved this movie, and I found it absolutely wonderful! I cried a lot, but otherwise, it was great. I would have to state the theme of this movie as love is tough and often hard to endure, but it is shown in a variety of ways even when it isn't obvious. This movie has many different relationships throughout which display that exact sentiment Emma and Aurora, Aurora and Garrett, Emma and Flap, Emma and Patsy, Emma and her children. Love is difficult, and often times, it is hard to show and prove to someone that you love them. However, it is through those terms of endearment that you truly do build lasting and meaningful relationships. This movie is a real tear-jerker. It begins the story with an overbearing, overprotective mother trying desperately to protect her only child, Emma, from any harm. With the passing of Emma's father though, there is a bit of role reversal in which codependent mother, Aurora, often seeks her independent daughter, Emma's support and love that should be shown to her instead. In one scene in particular, Emma is sound asleep, and Aurora comes into the room to wake her up to see if she wants to sleep with her. Emma states no, and Aurora ends up sleeping in her child's bed instead. Emma's best friend in the world is Patsy. The 2 are inseparable. In this movie, Patsy is right alongside Emma for majority of the ups and downs her wedding, her marriage, her affair, her illness. Their relationship is touching. There is one scene where Patsy says to Emma, You're my touchstone, Emma. This was a very heartwarming scene in the movie. These 2 friends are lifelong. As Emma grows into a woman, she falls in love with a man by the name of Flap Horton. They marry, and Aurora makes a spectacle by not showing up for the wedding. She says to her daughter, You are not special enough to overcome a bad marriage. Unfortunately, Aurora's comment isn't far from being true about theirs being a bad marriage. Emma and Flap's relationship is often tumultuous and tested by environmental factors such as other romantic interests, common woes of everyday marriages, and Flap has to deal with Emma and Aurora's very off-balanced relationship. They were definitely tested right from the start. Emma and Flap's marriage and union result in 3 children in the movie Tommy, Teddy, and Melanie. Emma's relationship is definitely tried and tested especially with her oldest boy, Tommy, but you can tell throughout the movie that Tommy loves his mother. He is just very unsure of how to deal with everything that surrounds him in his very dramatic life.Aurora, in the midst of Emma's drama, is able to find love once again. She had many gentleman suitors that were trying to catch her eye, but only one man could do the job her next door neighbor and former-astronaut, Garrett Breedlove. Garrett is a ladies' man, and he is very much a beast that will not be tamed; however, Aurora allows herself to become involved with him. He gives her as much as he is capable of giving, and he is there for her when it matters most. They have a very deep friendship, and she confides in him unlike she has with anyone else. Toward the end of the movie, we come to find out that Flap is having an affair. Emma and her family had been relocated to Nebraska to be closer to Janice (Flap's mistress), and Emma finds this out the same day that she finds out she is sick. After finding Flap and Janice together on the campus of the school that he taught at, Emma goes to the doctor with Melanie for routine flu shots, and the doctor discovers a lump under her armpit, and they do tests and find out it is malignant. She ends up losing her life to the battle, and her children get left with Aurora as Flap is unsure if he can handle them on his own. Patsy had wanted to take Melanie, but Emma would not allow the children to be split up. This movie was amazing, and while it was sad, it was also inspiring to me.Nothing good comes easily. You have to work for love, fight for love, and always, always stand up for love. Any meaningful relationship will have ups and downs. This movie merely makes a person look at what they have, examine it closely, and be thankful for it &#x96; even the difficult moments.

Even with this significant flaw, I consider BoMC a great movie. Think of coming across a Vermeer with a U-frame-it. The more you look at the actual painting, the less the frame matters. BoMC is almost that good.Robert and Francesca chance to meet in front of her farmhouse, as Robert has gotten lost looking for Roseman Bridge. Both are long settled into lives that make this meeting stupendously unlikely; he's a globe-trotting photographer and she's been in this house tending her family for nearly 20 years, although she hails from Baro, Italy, making her being there that way at all unlikely to begin with. She's been listening to opera beating dust out of a rug while husband and kids are off showing a prize steer at the Illinois state fair, where they'll be for four days.The two of them are in for a life changing relationship, although it seems at first like nothing more than a small detour for him and a break in the routine for her. They gradually awaken in each other dormant longings for a different kind of life than what they have. At the end of the four days, they are torn, and the movie works because we're torn with them.They have quite a lot to say to each other, but there's more than enough room for the dialog within the farmhouse kitchen, the exteriors around the bridge and the honky tonk joint they venture to on Wednesday, within the score and the Johnny Hartman love songs. (Who knew that old style radio with tubes in it could sound so good?!) Susan Sarandon (in Dead Man Walking) is the answer to who got the Oscar Streep should have won for her performance here, but she needed Eastwood to play against for that performance to have had the resonance it has. When Robert says he's not really an artist, I feel like he's speaking for Eastwood, telling us what he really would like to be but doubts he has the stuff for, although there's artistry there that Francesca connects with. In any event, without Eastwood's physicality, Francesca\/Streep's transformation wouldn't make sense. Eastwood's acting is sometimes harshly judged, but I see him here fully inhabiting the character of Robert, perhaps because it's similar to his own.Forty years ago or more everything was poignant, to the point where the word was a cliché, but the word fits BoMC and the relationship between Robert and Francesca like none that I've ever seen in any other movie. The screenplay, the actors, the cinematography, and the score all work together.Many reviewers have objected to the movie's portrayal of infidelity, some so upset that it seems they've overlooked that this is a work of fiction. I could better understand the objections if Robert and Francesca's affair had a happy ending or was seen to have no consequences. Neither of these is the case here; both Robert and Francesca, having tasted the forbidden fruit, will never recover their previously settled lives, will forever experience a sense of loss. Meanwhile, Francesca's family will never know that anything happened, except that Richard expresses regret on his deathbed that he couldn't fulfill Francesca's dream, a scene that didn't ring true for me.Look at it this way the book upon which this movie is based was wildly popular in spite of its prose being almost universally reviled by everyone with any pretension at all of literary taste. Were these many readers attracted by the opportunity to be offended by a tawdry affair? Isn't it more likely that there's much appeal from a story of unexamined lives, unrealized potential, the road not taken, of an exploration of what love is really about, even when the story is poorly written?In the end, I think the portrayal of what imperfect people might do seemed real enough to be upsetting to viewers who would prefer to see good people doing good things and being rewarded and bad people doing bad things and being punished.

Meanwhile, Francesca's family will never know that anything happened, except that Richard expresses regret on his deathbed that he couldn't fulfill Francesca's dream, a scene that didn't ring true for me.Look at it this way the book upon which this movie is based was wildly popular in spite of its prose being almost universally reviled by everyone with any pretension at all of literary taste. Were these many readers attracted by the opportunity to be offended by a tawdry affair? Isn't it more likely that there's much appeal from a story of unexamined lives, unrealized potential, the road not taken, of an exploration of what love is really about, even when the story is poorly written?In the end, I think the portrayal of what imperfect people might do seemed real enough to be upsetting to viewers who would prefer to see good people doing good things and being rewarded and bad people doing bad things and being punished. There are movies for these people, and to be sure, Bridges of Madison County isn't one of them, which makes it more interesting for the rest of us.

You will do it all here...When I first seen this movie, it was years after it came out on the big screen. It advertised two gangs going at it and me and my two pals thought..wow, lets give this a look. It starts out decent enough until one of the Jets does a ballerina move and I squirmed in my seat. Since when do gangs dance around town? Got past that to finally understand the message and how it was presented too. Seen it 30 times since then and will see it again. Everyone in this movie played their parts to the hilt when it was their turn. The dancing required was exhausting and repeated over and over until they got the perfect scene filmed. The excellence that went into this film is extra-ordinary and brings to the viewer a superior experience bar none. They do something at the end of the movie that I thought was brilliant.

On one hand, it is infantile, coarse, graceless, outrageous for the sake of it, and - let's be fair - one of the least sophisticated animated series ever. On the other hand, it has often had some very good points to make, some sharp satire, and it is frequently very funny.So what of the movie? How do you manage to sustain the triviality of the typical half hour episode for feature length. Well, you start by writing a really good script, which wraps a number of excellent points (not least the free speech issue, with particular reference to bad language ie. South Park itself) in a narrative which effortlessly embraces them all, notwithstanding how daft it is, pepper it with some very catchy songs (and these songs are genuine ear candy, albeit peppered with profanity), crank up the production values (musically and animation effects the basic animation remains clumsy cut-outs), and you have a film which maintains the appeal of this series, has an underlying seriousness, and is very, very funny.This is a work of demented genius.

It stars Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, and James Mason. It is widely considered a landmark in imagery and suspense, which had never before been done on such a scale as in this film.The theme of the movie is mistaken identity. The movie is about an advertising executive named Roger Thornhill, played by Grant, who is kidnapped at a restaurant when he leaves his table to try to make a phone call. He has no idea why the men grab him, but he is thrown in a car and driven to a mansion owned by the Townsend family, the head of which works at the United Nations. A man who he assumes is Townsend (James Mason) interrogates him there, and accuses him to be a US spy named George Kaplan. This series of events catches an unwilling Thornhill up in the events of the Cold War. He tries to solve the mystery of who Kaplan really is, and later uncover the true identity of the man who had him kidnapped. Along the way he meets Eve Kendall, (Eva Marie Saint) who is also not what she seems.The theme of the film really works well when one considers the time in which it was made. It was created during the fearful Cold War between the United States and Russia, where Red Scare suspicion ran rampant. The movie plays on these fears through its use of mistaken identity throughout. The villain is not who he says he is, and he thinks Thornhill, the protagonist, is someone else. This creates an environment of paranoia and distrust; where anyone can be an enemy threatening not only your life, but the way of life in the entire nation you live in. The motif of suspicion is the purveying feeling throughout. The suspense created in the movie was very real for people living in the United States at the time, which only bolstered the film's success.Color is used in the movie in a surprisingly normal way. The movie takes place mostly in the daytime, with the outdoor scenes using the natural lighting from the sun, and the indoor scenes doing the same, often with large windows. The climactic scenes take place at night however, both in a mansion and on the face of Mount Rushmore. It's strange how once the revelations are made in the film, the climax takes place in darkness. This lack of light seems to play on the themes of mistaken identity by almost hiding the characters whose identities the audience has discovered. I really enjoyed this movie, and had not seen it prior to viewing it for HUMN 246. Even though I am a fan of old movies, I was surprised at how it kept my attention throughout, even though most of the film involves Grant's character running around and trying to figure out what's going on. I compare it to The Bourne Identity because it deals with mistaken identity and trying to figure out who all the players in the plot are.
