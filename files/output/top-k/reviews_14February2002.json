[{"date":"14 February 2002","score":"8 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Hewitt is in college and struggling to maintain her grades after the traumatic events that occurred the previous summer. She and her friends win an all-expenses-paid vacation to the Bahamas, but it quickly turns into a nightmare when the menacing fisherman returns with vengeance on his mind. The first film may not have been a classic, but surely it could have inspired a much better sequel; this poorly-conceived slasher film has a ridiculous setup, nonexistent plot, little suspense, and an abundance of false scares. Even worse is a multitude of one-note supporting characters, senseless violence, plus manipulative and obvious plot twists that build up to a predictable finale. With the exception of a talented cast, there isn't a single redeeming factor here. *½ ","genre":null},{"date":"14 February 2002","score":"8 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Hewitt is in college and struggling to maintain her grades after the traumatic events that occurred the previous summer.
