I love science and science fiction both. They are in fact 2 of my main interests in life. This movie still bored me beyond description! The accolades being heaped upon this hunk of garbage is hilarious. The most amusing tendency among the fans of this movie is ridiculing those who think it is boring and meaningless as stupid, ignorant or both. I am a professional in the computer design and engineering business. I am not stupid. And guess what? This movie is still boring and meaningless. It does have some of the best special effects of its era. In fact, most of the effects in this film would stand next to todays advanced digital special effects without being embarrassed. This is the one and only redeeming quality of this film. It's a collection of very long, very boring scenes that never seem to end. People have mentioned some of the most boring parts. The problem in listing them all is that it would be much easier to list the parts which are NOT boring babble. This movie is a complete waste of.....what seemed like 20 hours of my life. I highly recommend that you never waste time on such trash. For those who will attempt to dismiss my comment along with the other people they have dismissed let me be perfectly clear. I understood everything in the film. It is simply a terrible film. This pseudo-intellectual drivel is a director who thinks he's quite brilliant in his high school level presentation and vision of the journey of man. Of course he is very wrong indeed! If you enjoy this then I suggest you browse youtube for videos made by either inarticulate adults, or videos posted by immature children expressing their simplistic ideas of the world and mankind. The director is incompetent. What takes him 15 minutes of very boring film, a segment he labels the dawn of mankind, near the beginning of the film is a segment that a skilled filmmaker would be able to accomplish in about 2 minutes at most. In fact that sums up what this movie really is. Very simplistic ideas drawn out, and I do mean DRAWN OUT SEEMINGLY FOREVER, in an effort to convince the audience that the filmmakers were very smart people. Hold a copy of the movie in your hand and you will see the condescension dripping from it. It's disjointed. It lacks cohesiveness. It adds elements of science fiction, horror, fantasy, and pre-teen created entertainment. It also fails to deliver in any of these categories. Stop attacking those who do not like this film. They aren't nearly as stupid as is implied here. This movie really does suck this bad. It's almost entirely comprised of shots and contrived scenes which are intended to showcase the effects. Nice effects. Utterly worthless film. Obtain and enjoy some of the many great documentary films about the space program if you want to see great scenery of space. To complete this huge hunk of celluloid garbage, the filmmakers end it with scenes that are not only long but can only be compared to patients in an insane asylum babbling incoherently. No we're not stupid. This movie just sucks. Beauty? Hardly. Deep? If you have a 5th grade education perhaps. Worth watching? Absolutely not! There is nothing brilliant about meaningless film that must be interpreted by the few viewers who claim they have the answer. Thats just incompetent lazy film making.

That would usually be a criticism. But in this case, the film is able to afford to look good in its' seasonal setting. It's almost always raining, the sky is always overcast in the film. This manages to create a bit of mood. One the movie desperately needs. This is another one of those ultra-silly horror \/ thrillers. Like 1993's Army of Darkness, 1987's House II The Second Story, Or 1990's Tremors- although that was an enjoyable movie. Frighteners is a big budget Hollywood movie. And it's so dumb, so insulting to the intelligence that it feels more like Space Jam (which yes, was even more fun than this pile of garbage) or Free Willy (no comment) than it does Jackson's earlier horror masterpieces. It's like- horror for kids. Really dumb kids. Filled with ear-pokingly (makes you want to) one-liners, fake-looking CGI, and actors going so over the top that it makes 1989's Meet the Feebles look restrained!It was pretty obvious this film would go the safe route by hiring Michael J. Fox (Mr. Family Ties) to be the insurance policy. What killed this film financially? The R rating and nothing more. Because the success of movies like Tommy Boy, The Blair Witch Project, and Dumb and Dumber proves that people will watch anything. Perhaps the fact that it was also 2 hours long and featured a pair of nasty serial killers viciously murdering people in flashback was also a bit of a turn-off. I won't even go that far. I pretty much stated my case back there. It's too loud, it's too talky- all the talking being really bad jokes, there are too many characters in it, almost all the special effects are computerized, and the movie's sense of humor is so aimed toward children. It's as though Jackson just wanted to do another gagfest, like his previous splatter films, but had completely run out of good gags. So he just has the cast inhale a few pounds of sugar before each take and we have to watch them hop around, acting goofy. Except for the sadly miscast John Astin, stuck playing an old coot who not only is tired and saggy, but is killed half-way through the movie. And he was the only ghost I could stand!This movie is so cliché-heavy, it's oppressive. Not to mention it's yet another one of those do as many mean things as we can to the protagonist to put the audience through hell... After the first 25 minutes, the entire remaining 1 hour and 35 (shy of the credits) are a series of misunderstandings and set ups to make things more difficult for Michael J. Fox, who was already showing the signs of suffering from Parkinson's disease. So it's twice as upsetting to see him as the constant butt of cruel jokes. It looks like he's really suffering. This is not funny. It's genuinely rotten and offensive in addition to not being amusing. I think the genre had already had its' fill of this kind of plot. Especially in Wes Craven's Shocker and The Serpent and the Rainbow. Who wants to watch a pity the poor guy movie anymore? If they're going to make a stupid comedy, that's one thing. The stupid comedy genre always has room for more. But this is supposed to be horror. A genre Peter Jackson has a lot of experience with. His previous films, Bad Taste and Dead Alive, clearly dried up his entire reserve of talent.Since this is an attempt to bring Jackson's horror to America, he recruited a few big horror names. The best cast actor here is Dee Wallace, the scream queen with roles in such high-profile films as Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes, Joe Dante's The Howling, 1983's Cujo, 1986's Critters, and 1990's misguided but still fun Popcorn. She plays the frumpy old spinster daughter of an even older creepy woman, played brilliantly by Julianna McCarthy, who has a face that was made for a horror film! The only good scenes involve Wallace's character playing helpless victim to Trini Alvarado, begging her to save her from her tyrant mother... just wait until that frail little victim gets hold of a shotgun and then see how helpless she looks! Fox is always pro. And a lot more tolerable and sympathetic here than in his usual 'party-guy', show off hero routine. He ages and matures a lot by this role, which is a shame that he wastes his new talent on this lemon. He's a very beautiful man when he isn't fooling around as much. In fact, in this circus freakshow, he's the straight man with the fewest wild gestures. A bit of a first for him.The rest of the cast are pure annoyance. There's a stereotypical black ghost, a stereotypical nerdy white ghost, the stereotypical Horace Pinker-like obnoxious serial killer (played by Jake Busey, taking all of Fox's old over the top-isms, and strongly resembling the actor who always taunted him in the Back to the Future films), and a stereotypically lame, irritating soldier-captain ghost who talks too loud and gets right in the camera lens, shouting army terms. There is perhaps one exception- Peter Dobson. Yes, I find him kinda hot. But that's not why I bring him up. He's actually pretty funny (come to think of it... HE looks a little like the actor who taunted Michael J. Fox in the Back to the Future films too!) and he's equally good in the 1999 comedy Drowning Mona where he plays a bumbling sheriff. But the icing on the cake is truly Re-Animator's import, Jeffrey Combs.

There's a stereotypical black ghost, a stereotypical nerdy white ghost, the stereotypical Horace Pinker-like obnoxious serial killer (played by Jake Busey, taking all of Fox's old over the top-isms, and strongly resembling the actor who always taunted him in the Back to the Future films), and a stereotypically lame, irritating soldier-captain ghost who talks too loud and gets right in the camera lens, shouting army terms. There is perhaps one exception- Peter Dobson. Yes, I find him kinda hot. But that's not why I bring him up. He's actually pretty funny (come to think of it... HE looks a little like the actor who taunted Michael J. Fox in the Back to the Future films too!) and he's equally good in the 1999 comedy Drowning Mona where he plays a bumbling sheriff. But the icing on the cake is truly Re-Animator's import, Jeffrey Combs. A man I have a lot of respect for, but an actor who has a habit of picking really lousy roles that are so unlikable, you just want to punch him! And the character he plays here will forever be the most annoying character in horror history!

So main stream that probably a musical is coming up soon, even for Home Alone.Joe is different. It is a philosophical romantic comedy, with it can separate the romance with the comedy bit too !!! And not a lot of us can house those 3 ingredients inside AND enjoy their coexistence at the same time. Firstly the romantics would not get why meg Ryan played 3 characters. The heavy thinkers would not know the i'm not arguing with you Joe bit, so on .. .. and so on.I first saw this in theatre.. then it never left my mind until video.. yes. back then.. it was tape.
