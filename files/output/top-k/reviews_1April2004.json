The attention to the finer details given by Hitchcock was what really set this movie to rights, but it did not hurt that there was real charisma there between Stewart and Novak.Stewart, who was Hitchcock's ideal for the average American guy, was nothing less than stellar in his Vertigo performance. His range of talent shows an outright absence of inhibitory characteristics. He goes from the warm yet aloof Scotty to the angry and downright mad Scotty in such a pure believability that his performance alone is one of the major factors in My assessment of this film as one of Hitchcock's very best.But where would Stewart's performance be without the full-figured and capable talents of his leading lady? Kim Novak was arguably one of the best talents of this film era. She was perfectly cast in the role of the mysterious yet earthy type lady of wealth who had a slight...problem. But, while her performance here was nothing but pure perfection, I must say I liked her character more in Bell, Book and Candle.This story is one for the arm-chair psychiatrists out there; fraught with twists and turns, switch-backs and double-meanings, you could easily find yourself lost if you look away only for a moment. This is definitely a movie for the thinkers, and not the busy-bodies who enjoy watching a movie while doing other things. This story deserves nothing less than your full attention.While not considered Hitchcock's best work, or even among his best work, while he was still working, this endeavor has come to be known as such since his demise. To look at this now, so many years after its making and see it for the brilliance it was takes only a couple of hours and an adult attention span. He was so far ahead of his time, that his audiences just did not get the cruel irony of this attempt and as such, we nearly lost for all time one of the greatest masterpieces of suspense ever made. Only through the hard work and great dedication of those involved was this brilliant work restored. We are, indeed, fortunate as a society that this was even possible.IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THIS MOVIE, THERE ARE MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!I loved the cruel irony of the ending. The fact that she had played him so freaking well only to die as her predecessor had. I thought that Hitchcock tried his best to use a fear common to many people; IE the fear of heights, in order to draw his audience in. I enjoyed watching Hitchcock's demonstration of Scotty's slow mental spiral as everything began weighing on his subconscious; all the little details, all the tiny pieces that were swimming around in his head. It really looked as though he would snap, when in reality, he was quietly placing each piece into the necessary slot to make the picture come together for him. I also must comment on the use of the gray suit used by Hitchcock and worn by Kovak. It was used, IMO to make her all the more stunning in the evening gown she wore when Scotty first laid eyes on her.Everything else she wore after that was black, white or grey, to heighten the beauty of her in that one scene. Grey is usually a bad color for blonds. It washes them out and makes them look like they're wearing green pan for a black and white oldie. But Hitchcock did that on purpose as effect. Speaking of effects, the camera work here is simply stunning.That and the whole movie was nothing more than a parable teaching us to face our fears rather than surrender to them. This was the best in his suspense line. I loved Psycho, too, but I always considered it more the first in the slasher sub-genre rather than suspense.This movie rates a solid 8.9\/10 from...the Fiend .

And there are reviews a mile long all over the internet about how rediculously bad this film is. Here are my thoughts; Although I have mixed emotions about it, I liked it. I can say with all honesty, that I have never seen anything quite like it, anywhere before. (SPOILERS)The premise is as follows; a young budding man takes the already corrupted throne of power from Tiberius, who is sick and dieing.

I feel it's king of bad cinema reputation is highly overrated and incorrect. Is it revolutionary in idea? Not really. Is it the worst film I've ever seen? No way. This type of period piece has been done many times before. The 'power corrupts' story and the 'decadent portrait of the pagan Romans' theme is pretty much a universal theme in the sword and sandal epics of American Cinema (see Ben Hur,Gladiator,etc.) But the Excesses of Rome were never quite as in your face as they are here. Although many would disagree, I feel I can take this film's plot line somewhat seriously. It has a story-structure in which I must admit, does grow dimmer by the end of the film, but has wonderful actors, all giving a very serious and credible performance. It appears to have a budget, with gigantic sets, hundreds of extras (mostly Italian I believe)and it has a heart, of sorts, in the caligula character, and his control over Rome and it's plight. This alone is more than most Arnold Schwartzenegger(sp?) movies have, but nobody seems to spend a lot of time bashing these flicks. Although Caligula the character, is despicable, and does some pretty terrible things, I felt as though, in the film, he was only the product of the society that gave him that position. Malcom Mcdowell(sp?) portrays an eagerness, to his soon coming of power, at the beginning of the film and then lets his grasp on reality immediately start slipping when he takes the throne. I enjoyed seeing the softer side of Caligula at the beginning (when he is shown frolicking in the forest with his lover).Much of what you heard about the sex in this movie is true. The sex is real and all of it seems to be shot as though the director (Bob G.)wasn't even aware of censorship laws. In terms of intensity, you won't find anything here that you didn't see in In the Realm of the Senses, in which many, including myself, deem as an artistic classic. For those of you who haven't seen that film, this means real penetration, real mouth to genital contact etc. In terms of content, I saw a lot of shots that by themselves, look like they were shot by someone who deals in the business of sex (and fetishisms; the urination scene for instance). Personally I did not even really feel the excess of sex scenes in the film until the final orgy scene, where I admit, it did seem slightly gratuitus. Sometimes I felt the director was trying to use the sex scenes as metaphors for the story line as we realized the full excesses of Caligula's corrupted reign. And that we the viewer were also indulging in Rome's excesses with Caligula, and we were supposed to feel uncomfortable about that. There seems to be myths about the film that go unchallenged; First, there is no 210 min. print in commercial existence. Only the unrated cut (which is the one I have seen), and the R rated cut. Second, contrary to many user-posts on IMDb, there are no scenes of bestiality (although he's uncomfortably fond of his horse), there are no scenes of pedophilia (child-sex)(although there is a verbal reference to it in the line do you like little boys? No, big boys-my soldiers)and there are NO scenes of necrophilia (although it is perhaps suggested with Drusilla). All in all, Caligula's flaw seems to be excess, and a lack of control over something that was too big for anyone to hang onto. But then again, that could be said of the Roman Empire... And whether the film is historically accurate or not, there certainly were rulers of ancient Rome who were capable of this kind of behavior and probably did act this way. Not for the squeamish, but for those who are used to contemporary sex and violence, give it a shot. Also check out Queen Margot for another view of a different corrupted empire.

","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"1 April 2004","score":"121 out of 130 people found the following review useful","review":"  The first time I saw To Kill A Mockingbird was at a drive-in theater.  I was probably about ten or eleven at the time.  Even at a young age I was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that I could easily relate to.  Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, held a kind of mystery and an eeriness for me, much in the way a ghost story would.  I'm not about to make the pretense that I understood the social significance of To Kill A Mockingbird at the age of ten, or even the greatness of the film.  That would come later in life, after having viewed it in one of it's first network television broadcasts.One of the things that makes To Kill A Mockingbird a truly great film is the love and respect everyone involved in bringing Harper Lee's novel to the screen had for the original source material.  It shows up on screen in every single frame.  Each performance in this film is beyond reproach.  Gregory Peck had many fine performances over his storied career, but none every approached the perfection he brought to his portrayal of Atticus Finch.  As Atticus, Peck brings us the depth of understanding as to how his love for Jem and Scout enables him to treat his children with respect and honesty.  He never talks down to them, but approaches them on a level in which children of their age can comprehend and learn from his own wisdom.  Yet, he is still able to retain the same no nonsense approach as other parents.  Atticus is also a man who believes in the integrity of justice, yet recognizes the failings of our justice system.  When called upon to do his duty, he does so, despite the hatred and venom brought to bear upon him and his children by the citizens of the town in which he lives.In casting Jem, Scout and Dill, Producer Alan J. Pakula and Director Robert Mulligan faced a daunting task.  So much of the success of To Kill A Mockingbird depended on the pivotal role these characters would play in the film.  For Jem he chose Philip Alford, for Scout, Mary Badham, and for Dill, John Megna.  Alford and Badham were both southern natives who had never been in films before.  Megna was a New York native but was also inexperienced.  It is this inexperience and lack of polish that enables all three to shine on the screen.  Mulligan began filming by letting them act as if making a film was like recess, allowing them to play on the set, and only moving the camera gradually as they became accustomed to their surroundings.  It paid off in every way imaginable.  None of the three ever appear as if they are actors acting, and bring a childlike wonder and presence to their roles that I had never seen before, and will unlikely witness again.Brock Peters as Tom Robinson, the black man falsely accused of raping a white girl, also gives a performance which he would never again surpass.  You will not find anywhere a more memorable scene in any court room than when he testifies on the witness stand.  Because he dared to care about a white girl, he now faces almost certain death if convicted, and perhaps even if not convicted.  It is the first time I was able to begin to understand the effects of man's prejudice and hatred of a man simply because of the color of his skin.  Just as Jem and Scout came of age, and realized the significance of the injustices of racial hatred, so did I.Equally significant, is Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell. She makes it easy for many to hate her, but like Atticus, we see in her a person to be more pitied than hated.  She is a product of not only the times in which she lives, but even more so of her wretched upbringing.  Mayella is what she is, but only because of the deep cutting prejudices of those around her.  To Mayella, being caught enticing a black man into your house for relations, is the ultimate crime and the penalty for doing so is unthinkable to her.In his screen debut as Boo Radley, Robert Duvall also brings to life the mysterious neighbor that once frightened Jem, Dill, and Scout so much.  Though on the screen for a short length of time, without uttering a word, Duvall shows us a man tortured by years of cruelty, mistreatment, and the gossip and whispers of neighbors.  He is a man who wants only to live in his own way, yet the bond that links him to Jem and Scout is significant.  They are the childhood he had never really known.  Just as Tom Robinson, he has never brought harm to anyone, yet suffers significantly just for the right to be able to exist.The care with which To Kill A Mockingbird was brought to the screen can also be seen in the Art Direction by Henry Bumstead and Set Decoration by Oliver Emert.  They indeed bring to life what a small Southern Town would have been like in the early thirties. Cinematographer Russel Harlan's black and white photography brings it all vividly to the screen, especially in the way he captures the foreboding of the Radley house, the moments when Bob Ewell approaches Jem when he is left in a car alone, and even more noteworthy near the end of the film when Jem and Scout are walking home from a school play.

","genre":null},{"date":"1 April 2004","score":"121 out of 130 people found the following review useful","review":"  The first time I saw To Kill A Mockingbird was at a drive-in theater.  I was probably about ten or eleven at the time.  Even at a young age I was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that I could easily relate to.  Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, held a kind of mystery and an eeriness for me, much in the way a ghost story would.  I'm not about to make the pretense that I understood the social significance of To Kill A Mockingbird at the age of ten, or even the greatness of the film.  That would come later in life, after having viewed it in one of it's first network television broadcasts.One of the things that makes To Kill A Mockingbird a truly great film is the love and respect everyone involved in bringing Harper Lee's novel to the screen had for the original source material.  It shows up on screen in every single frame.  Each performance in this film is beyond reproach.  Gregory Peck had many fine performances over his storied career, but none every approached the perfection he brought to his portrayal of Atticus Finch.  As Atticus, Peck brings us the depth of understanding as to how his love for Jem and Scout enables him to treat his children with respect and honesty.  He never talks down to them, but approaches them on a level in which children of their age can comprehend and learn from his own wisdom.  Yet, he is still able to retain the same no nonsense approach as other parents.  Atticus is also a man who believes in the integrity of justice, yet recognizes the failings of our justice system.  When called upon to do his duty, he does so, despite the hatred and venom brought to bear upon him and his children by the citizens of the town in which he lives.In casting Jem, Scout and Dill, Producer Alan J. Pakula and Director Robert Mulligan faced a daunting task.  So much of the success of To Kill A Mockingbird depended on the pivotal role these characters would play in the film.  For Jem he chose Philip Alford, for Scout, Mary Badham, and for Dill, John Megna.  Alford and Badham were both southern natives who had never been in films before.  Megna was a New York native but was also inexperienced.  It is this inexperience and lack of polish that enables all three to shine on the screen.  Mulligan began filming by letting them act as if making a film was like recess, allowing them to play on the set, and only moving the camera gradually as they became accustomed to their surroundings.  It paid off in every way imaginable.  None of the three ever appear as if they are actors acting, and bring a childlike wonder and presence to their roles that I had never seen before, and will unlikely witness again.Brock Peters as Tom Robinson, the black man falsely accused of raping a white girl, also gives a performance which he would never again surpass.  You will not find anywhere a more memorable scene in any court room than when he testifies on the witness stand.  Because he dared to care about a white girl, he now faces almost certain death if convicted, and perhaps even if not convicted.  It is the first time I was able to begin to understand the effects of man's prejudice and hatred of a man simply because of the color of his skin.  Just as Jem and Scout came of age, and realized the significance of the injustices of racial hatred, so did I.Equally significant, is Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell. She makes it easy for many to hate her, but like Atticus, we see in her a person to be more pitied than hated.

It was predictable, a bit pretentious and just goes to show that good cinema isn't allowed to be fun by any stretch of the imagination.I mean, when Bjork and her cop friend start talking in the first ten minutes, I KNEW where it would all lead up to.  Basically the conversation, in a nut shellBjork I'm saving up thousands of dollars for my son's eye operation.  It's hidden in the kitchencop I wish my wife wouldn't spend so much money....I'm so broke...All I could do was scream at how obvious the set up was.  Two hours later, it all plays out as predicted, a crime everyone likes to slap on the big budget films.Maybe I'm just too mainstream, but I see no entertainment value, no value in its morality.  I felt nothing but irritation at the cast trying to lead the story to its obvious conclusion.  The ending was sooo schmaltzy it puts Bruckheimer to shame.  Pearl Harbor gets slammed for being so over the top, but Dancer is just as guilty.  Bjork's character has to be stubborn about the blindness just so the movie can meander it's way up to the most melodramatic death scene I ever shook my head at.Most people will read this and be unable to comprehend my reaction, Just as I cannot comprehend how others could find this film to be so moving.  I am by no means advocating that the film needs a car chase or anything.  Adding cliches is not the solution, a problem that makes many mainstream films mediocre.The problem with Indy filmakers like Von Trier is that they HAVE to be sooo anti-Hollywood, to follow the notion that they have to keep it real. a notion which is absurd at best, and unhealthy at worst.  Certain people seem to think that good cinema must involve1) Family strife.  No real antagonists, just plain old everyday broken home atmospheres, cuz that's keepin it real.  I'm not asking for a goofy villain type, but I don't want to pay ten bucks to see cynical single parents struggling with their oblivious kids.2) At least one addict, wether it be money, drugs, sex.  Addicts make good performances, I guess, cuz they're not fun.3) At least one person dies a gritty death, because, well....can't have any fun...4) No fun allowed, no witty banter, no hope for the characters.  If there's any hope for the characters to be happy, it's just too Hollywood.A lot people can't understand my opinion, but there it is.  Dancer in the Dark is just no fun at all, and I cannot relate to any of it.  You can rave about its originality, its acting, the script, how it's so real, so anti-Hollywood.  But what's the point?  I get up every morning and I have to work with people who are just as pathetic as these characters.  Nobody has any sort of magnificence to them.  No humanity.  I have to put up with these people.  Why would I pay to see a film about characters who are just as pathetic?  Who's going to remember it in twenty years??  Can you quote lines from it??  Is it in ANY way significant to the evolution of film and entertainment?No, coffeehouse patrons of America, I must shatter what I consider to be a heinous myth.  Films are primarily an escapist medium.  Audiences want to forget about life for two hours, not be reminded.  The good guy doesn't HAVE to win, but there should at least be A good guy type.  You might scoff at that.  If it were not the case, why was Dancer vitually ignored in theatres while Gladiator gets the big treatment?  Why did Gladiator get the Oscar wins?

All this was to do with the government  and  politics and lies.

The silly plot goes like this - SPOILERS AHEAD - it's the time of the Cuba crisis, Pres. Kennedy is on TV and Dad Webber (Christopher Walken) decides to move himself and mother-to-be Helen (Sissy Spacek) to his underground fallout shelter, which turns out to be something like Fort Knox stocked with food and supplies enough for a medium-sized country. For no reason that I can see, a jet fighter on a survey mission (over Cuba ?) crashes on the Weber's house (in Los Angeles huh? ) convincing Dad that nuclear WWIII has started. So what more natural than that he locks himself with Helen about-to-deliver into the shelter by activating a 35-year time lock ?To help us swallow this scenario which will lead to their newborn son Adam (Brendan Fraser) growing up for 35 years with only his parents' tutelage in 1960s values, the scriptwriters helpfully explain some practical matters like the septic tank, but miss many others such as where does the electric power come from and why do they have unlimited technical equipment but no radio?Thankfully the 35 years go by fairly quickly (for us), the door lock goes click and now our family can emerge. Whoops - the reason given for staying underground is that the nuclear radiation has a half-life of 35 years so declaring an all-clear seems premature. Anyway Dad does go upside and basically misunderstands everything he sees in the sleazy LA district that has developed where the Webber house used to stand. He returns convinced that radiation has caused a race of mutant humans to evolve. Hellooooo!Now it is son Adam's turn to venture into today's world, and what has happened so far is best forgotten as being a clumsy set-up for the boy-meets-girl formulaic comedy that follows. I find that hardly worth describing, it has stereotypical characters and the girl that Adam meets is named Eve (played by Alicia Silverstone who is sour when she should be sweet and never gets sweet at all). After a bit of chasing,  a bit of Eve getting bitchy about Adam being popular with girls at a nightclub, one of whom really is sweet, a bit of Adam punching a rival boyfriend, a bit of Adam being gentlemanly to the first black person he meets, an ongoing joke with a gay friend who understands Eve (but thankfully does not ham up his stereotype), it is time for Adam and Eve to ride off together into the sunset - or, in this case, to gently ease his parents into the present, non-atom-blasted reality. Why that should be such a problem, and why a goofy religious fanatic needs to be kept on hand after he has delivered a few gags, I can't tell you. The movie just seemed to run out into the sand at that juncture.But I am not complaining, nor do I feel the need to expose this good-hearted comedy to probing sociological analysis nor poke more holes in it. For similar movie-meat cooked much more profoundly, watch instead Pleasantville, which I have also reviewed. BTW is the Viet Nam debacle still such a catharsis in the US\/Hollywood psyche that filmmakers turn to the Cuban missile crisis almost as light relief ?
