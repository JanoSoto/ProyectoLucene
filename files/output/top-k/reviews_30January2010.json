Perhaps it is because the characters are not as deep and developed as you might want. Perhaps it is because this is really three stories in one.The first story, is what happened to the Event Horizon (a spaceship), several years ago.The second story, is what will happen to the Event Horizon in the future. (I'm being vague so as to avoid any spoilers).The third story, is what will happen to the crew sent on a rescue mission to find and recover the Event Horizon. This third story is the focus, told from the perspective of the rescue crew.This movie might have been better if it told just one story, giving itself more time to develop the characters. That way, a prequel (or two) could fill in some more of the back story.However, it seems like film makers are content to only make one movie nowadays. What's up with that? Don't they want money? Anyhow, all three stories take a back seat to the suspense aspects. This is more of a suspense movie than a horror movie, but I think that the horror is what makes the suspense worthwhile, so that is why I call it a suspense\/horror. The first time you watch it, you will be surprised, even if you think you see things coming.I own a copy of this movie and will enjoy re-watching it later, already have watched it a few times, but, I have to say that with all the good movies out now (including older movies which are being re-released, etc.), this may be more of a rental than a must-buy movie.As a rental movie, I rate it 9\/10, grade A.As a rental, the only thing that could have made it better, was more impact better dialog, faster pace with more action, more focused character development, less time spent building up the story.If you're looking to buy, I'd rate it only 6\/10, grade B.The quality of its parts are high but it just isn't remarkable enough. With a bit more effort, and perhaps making it a series of two or three movies instead of just one, it would have been much more impressive.Overall, then, 7\/10, or a B+ grade. Enjoyable as a rental, but make sure to screen it before you buy it.

I would like to call this movie a forest slasher such as The Prey (1984), Don't Go in the Woods (1980), Just Before Dawn (1980), or The Forest (1982) but since this movie barely even takes place in the forest, I would consider it more in the Friday the 13th (1980) or The Burning (1981) field. This movie is pretty much Friday the 13th with more creative death scenes, more plot holes, younger characters, less of a budget, and a shocking twist ending.The movie starts out with a man and his two children, Peter and Angela. The family is playing around in a lake but end up in a boating accident caused by some young water skiers. The accident kills the father and Peter. Eight years later, Angela (the survivor of the boating accident) has moved in with her aunt Martha and her cousin Ricky. Angela and Ricky are going to a summer camp for a few weeks but once they get there, Angela is regularly tormented by the mean counselors and kids at the camp. The kids and counselors that pick on Angela, specifically rude ass counselor named Meg and a bitchy girl named Judy, start getting killed off. This unfolds into a twisted climax fueled by creepy, homosexual subtext and driven by a deep, dark, secret.This movie is pretty messed up when compared to other slashers, but this isn't necessarily in a bad way. The characters are mainly the kids at camp which makes it more disturbing to watch when thinking of the standard body count this film includes. The deaths are actually very unique, such as a man (presumably) dying after being scalded with a vat a boiling water, a young girl being impaled on curling tongs (nobody can really explain how the curling iron kills her...), a young man is locked in a bathroom stall with a hornets' nest, etc. To be completely honest, I found myself rooting for the killer because the victims were extremely mean. I'm not saying it's right for somebody to kill somebody else because they're bullies, but I was happy when some of them died. The ending isn't really an ending to be fair. It's more like an enormous plot twist that ends right in the middle of the climax. That doesn't make the abrupt ending less amazing, in fact that just makes it more interesting because it makes you ask yourself what's next. All in all, the movie is quite a nice little horror opus. It gives gritty atmosphere, good suspense and shock, and a big curve ball of an ending.

With many twists and thoughts set up in a untraditional manner, Memento is essentially very poignant, depressing and can even be horrifying.The post-modern style of narrating is really fascinating, if not a bit over-the-top. However, any skepticism about this movie's style being over material is wiped out after the first viewing, if you really get it in the first viewing(which also proves you are cleverer than average). To say that the story in this movie flows backwards is a bit inaccurate because the story is an exploration of the origins of every chapter's confusion and conflicts. Have you ever tried to solve a puzzle because you experienced some terrible trauma? If yes, then Memento could be a very personal experience for you as you relate more and more to the main protagonist. Suppose we are given the tools of Leonard, should we be more competent in making the investigation? Or, are we asking ourselves what's justice and what it takes to be an ethical person? Thinking deep into these questions really made this movie a horror one.Each time a new character pops up in the screen, you would be puzzled by his\/her reason to be present, in later segment of the movie you would know what a big crude lie he\/she made for Leonard. You see? It's not up to us to decide we are ethical or not given this scenario. You could start like Teddy who wanted to help to end Leonard's misery by helping him and end like Teddy who's tired of Leonard's revenge game and begin to take advantage of that. You could also start like Natalie who's good at manipulating people's emotions, and then found a guy like Leonard a most valuable asset. The problem is anyone who encountered Leonard's condition will automatically become part of his dysfunction. The problem is, no one deserves to live with his condition, yet no one likes to share his burden and take care of his problem. That could be very morally challenging, especially if you had any family\/friend who's not so normal.Proverbs 423, Above all else, guard your heart; for it is the wellspring of life. Memento explores this script backwards, in which situations Leonard twisted himself again and again in pursuit of vengeance. Many people considered the movie a great plot hole because if Leonard really can't remember anything after the assault, how come he remembered he has the condition and the cops wouldn't help investigating the case? In the end, however, this is answered by Teddy that Leonard just remembered those he wanted to remember, which proves Leonard himself might just be a fraud, who's physically capable of making new memories but would rather choose to lie to himself. You may pity with him because like an autistic person he is suffering. But, it's Leonard who caged himself in the middle of the misery, and wouldn't let himself go. The horrifying message is that there is already no truth for Leonard because everything he thinks that matters would be forgotten in next minute, yet the only truth left for the audience is that with submarine motivations everyone lies just like Leonard and Teddy. However, thanks to the Bible which tells us people CAN choose to lie or to tell the truth(even mentally-challenged person like Leonard).

Unfortunately, while the movie looks very nice and Peck seemed to do a good job, the film did not seem to give that many insights into who MacArthur was nor was it a particularly thorough film about his life.The first thing that struck me was that the film started just after WWII began. In fact, the film ended up only covering the period of early 1942 until just after his dismissal in 1951 for insubordination. What about the other 74 or so years of his long and illustrious life?! Now I do understand that Peck couldn't play a younger MacArthur because he wasn't a young man when he took this role. Unfortunately, however, there were some incredibly important events that fall into this missing time period--such as when MacArthur, on his own, attacked the so-called Bonus Army in 1932, his service in Mexico and WWI as well as his personal life (the film shows his wife, but this was his second wife--what about the first?). Plus, following his removal from power in 1951, the man lived another 13 years--what about them? As a result, the film comes off as rather superficial and very incomplete.The other problem, and this actually was more serious for me, is that the character of MacArthur was tough to discern. Other than showing him as a bit of a publicity hound and a dedicated man, who was MacArthur? The only really good insight into him was that the film seemed to indicate that his clash with Truman appeared to be due to BOTH men being strong-willed--an interesting interpretation. Yes, you briefly saw his second wife and son and you could see that he loved them...but what else? Now these two problems make this film a relatively mediocre biopic. Sadly, the film did have some very nice aspects. Peck did a great job--as I'd expected. Also, the WWII and Korean segments were done well for the most part. I could nitpick because of the extensive use of grainy stock footage or the sailor on the deck of the USS Missouri in 1945 who is wearing very modern (circa 1977) glasses--but this is pretty unimportant.For a person who has little knowledge of MacArthur, this is a worthwhile film. For ex-history teachers and WWII buffs like myself, it was pretty much a waste of time--I could have learned a lot more from a TV show about the man. Perhaps the problem was insurmountable in a movie, however, and a mini-series would be the only way to do this amazing man's career justice. There's just too much stuff to cover for a 130 minute film.

There is so much I can write on this film but it may just ruin the best part for you. So I have decided to break this review of Mulholland Dr. into two, with spoilers and without. But I strongly suggest that you watch the film without going through the second part and after watching the film read it.P1 NO SPOILERS IN THIS&#x85; This is a thriller but not the normal thriller. Till the first hour or more the director David Lynch will try to fool you into believing that this is an Alfred Hitchcock crime story. A great atmosphere set up with something here and there in every scene but still that suspense lingers around without the plot really getting clear. Do not fall into the trap so well laid, keep awake and pay a lot of attention because the climax is going to blow you away. He doesn't give it away very easy, he makes you think. Many would say they got it straight away, but I doubt it. I first did not get what happened, I had to think, rewind and see some scenes again and then it all came together. So be prepared, that it will not blow you away straight on, but once you get it you surely will be left thinking for some time and will appreciate and love the film. P.S. This is the film that launched Naomi Watts&#x85; and she has given a splendid performance.P2 WARNING!!!

Also, it means that I actually don't really care about the characters because I have no emotional connection with them whatsoever. So when it comes down to it the only way to identify the characters is to classify them as either American or Somali, which for me kind of defeats the humanist point that Scott was obviously trying to get across. On the other hand there are some good actors to look out for, Eric Bana, Josh Harnett, Ewan McGregor, Jason Isaacs and Orlando Bloom all make welcome appearances. The film does also make some interesting points about war, interesting given modern events and that it was made pre-9\/11. In the end the film is good to watch for its nice visual effects and extremely gripping fight scenes. The film did grab me emotionally, but not because of the events that the characters found themselves in, more because of the situation that the Somali civilians found themselves in, something that the film didn't cover (which is fine because that's not what it's about).

For that to happen, they people populating this movie actually need development. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen here.In New York City, a deadly disease is wiping out all of the children. Since no vaccine or cure can be found, two scientists, Dr. Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) and Dr. Peter Mann (Jeremy Northam) decide to go after the carriers of the disease cockroaches (it's at this point that it becomes helpful to know that cockroaches are very adaptable, and would probably survive a nuclear holocaust, but never mind). The scientists create a new species, the Judas Breed, that is designed to wipe out the roaches, thus killing off the disease. Problem solved, right? Not quite. Three years later, the once-savior is now our worst nightmare.The leads are not ones that are normally associated with this kind of a movie. Mira Sorvino may have won an Oscar (which undoubtedly attracted the attention of the Weinsteins), but she's no Ripley. Sorvino holds her own, but she just doesn't have the screen presence needed to pull off this kind of a role. Same goes for Jeremy Northam. Northam is an accomplished British actor, but he just doesn't seem tough enough for his kind of role (one could argue that this makes them seem more real, but it isn't true). Josh Brolin has what could charitably be called a cameo, but the other two supporting actors, Charles S. Dutton and Giancarlo Giannini, are two people we can really feel for. Dutton is one of the great unrecognized character actors, seemingly able to conquer any type of role and draw the audience's sympathy like a magnet. Giannini, another good performer is in a role that is a far cry from his performance in A Walk in the Clouds. Giannini's great, but the script doesn't give us the depth that the actor does. And Oscar-winner F. Murry Abraham is also on hand in a brief appearance as the sort-of creepy mentor to Susan.When it comes to making creepy crawlies, no one does it better than Guillermo del Toro. Unfortunately, producer interference hampered his efforts in other parts of film-making (like plot coherency, for example). del Toro knows how to tell a story, but the money loving and creativity phobic Weinsteins stifled it as much as they could.

Hopefully this new interest in the original film could bring in an audience that has never even seen, nor even heard of what I believe to be, the most philosophical, and most thought-provoking film I've ever seen.The film is in all actuality an autobiography detailing the mind and life of its director. It's a movie about a director without inspiration making a movie about a director without inspiration who's making a movie about a director without inspiration, and so on and so forth.

He has no story, constantly making new things up and telling his crew to go to work on it even though Guido has no idea how it's going to fit into the film. The producer is breathing down his neck and Guido is pressured with developing a story, so he starts trying to draw bits from his childhood and his life experiences, such as the impact of all the mistresses and loving women in his life.The film is so psychological and philosophical, your mind is always in constant overdrive during the film. It is a mentally exhausting film to watch, not only does it have subtitles, but the film is so rife with symbolism and little intricate details that it is hard to drink it all in with one viewing. I think it goes without saying, this is a very dense film, probably the most dense I think I have ever seen.It is a surreal film told through Guido's stream of consciousness.

Following the life of Joe Gideon, played by Roy Scheider, as he choreographs, womanizes, and abuses his way to self-destruction, All That Jazz actually chronicles the life of Bob Fosse &#x96; a well-known musical theatre choreographer and director, screenwriter, and film director. While the art direction is superb, the costumes nearly flawless, and the score really, really moving, I kept waiting for the film to get better, and it never did. Between the wide area of subject matter (from the movie that Gideon was supposedly editing, to rehearsals for a new musical that he was staging, to his various complicated relationships with his ex-wife, girlfriend, and daughter), not actually knowing who Bob Fosse is, and the random, seemingly nonsensical Angel of Death (Jessica Lange) scenes, I spent the entire movie feeling like I was on the outside of an inside joke.The movie was choppy. It is not the editing and transitions that were choppy &#x96; and what transitions were choppy were that way for artistic value &#x96; but that the film jumped from one area to the next without giving the viewer time to catch up. In one scene you would be watching Gideon direct his dancers in the moves for a number, in the next he would be conversing with Angelique, the Angel of Death, on a topic that seemed to have nothing to do with the rehearsals we had just seen, and then in the next scene, he would be editing a movie that seemed to only be included in All That Jazz because it focused on the various stages of death. While some could argue that such choppiness was for artistic value, or that it was to make a specific point, I would say that you lose the value and the point when the movie becomes unintelligible and impossible to keep up with.The costumes, although there wasn't really all that much to them until the closing scene, were great. The mis-matched leotards and leg warmers contrasting with business suits and button-down shirts, only seemed to add to the gritty, slightly maniacal feel of the movie itself. The score was my favorite part of the film &#x96; along with the final number where Gideon sings to an audience of the movie's entire cast. The score was sharp and impeccably crafted and worked endlessly to try to create emotions and reactions that the choppiness of the film itself only took away from. The color, also, was incredibly well done, and could be appreciated most in scenes like the one where Joe is taken to the hospital, when the walls and the doctors' uniforms are all starkly white, giving the messy, colorful Gideon the air of being out of place and too contrary to save.The actors did what they could with a script that was jumbled and confused. Gideon had incredible chemistry with all of the women he had to work with on the screen, excepting Jessica Lange as Angelique &#x96; his scenes with her seemed wooden and out of place. However, his chemistry with Leland Palmer, who plays his former wife; Erzsabet Foldi, his daughter; Cynd Charisse, his mistress; and Deborah Geffner as a one-night stand is all fantastic &#x96; and all four of them manage to hold their own in solo scenes or interactions with each other. Roy Scheider himself carries the entire movie, giving an impassioned and heart-wrenching performance as the destructive, lonely Joe Gideon which gives the movie most of its soul and, for me, most of its value.Far more messy in the way that it is told and the subject matter that it tries to cover than other musicals &#x96; Chicago comes to mind &#x96; All That Jazz is a movie that, I believe, could have lasting value for those who know enough about Bob Fosse to appreciate the story that it tries to tell and the nuances &#x96; such as his ritual of declaring, It's showtime, folks! to himself in the mirror every morning &#x96; that it covers.

Well, look, it's not brilliant, but is it really the devil that many have painted it as? Not so say I. It's about as subtle as a sledgehammer all told, but Besson's study of the iconic\/infamous waif who did indeed expel the British hoards has gusto by the shed load. He nicely crafts the 15th century lands from which to tell his story, and then, to quote someone from another period epic, unleashes hell. Literally. Yep the British armies are stereotypically vile I bet Mel Gibson loves the Brit portrayals here, and the blood that is shed is vicious and borderline sick. But it works well in the context of Jeanne's prominent rise and subsequent fall, with her religious confliction deftly blending in with the blood being shed in the pursuit of liberation. Visually the film is a treat, and for action construction it holds up to be one of the better modern day historical epics in that department. But where's the substance?Ah, there's the big problem with the movie.

And it's actually Jovovich who suffers the most. She's great when she's screaming and launching into the enemy, taking an arrow hit with grace and dedication . But there's been no character depth laid out, so Jovovich's Jeanne just comes across as a moody teenager out to cause trouble. We need to have some insight into her troubled predicament and what drives her on, not the scantily written filler moments that actually are just appetisers to blood letting battles. There 's also annoyances when the film slips into moments of modern day speak, it's a crass and lazy oversight by the makers to think that we wouldn't notice such speak in 15th Century France. Besson surrounds Jovovich with some fine acting talent tho, even if some are a tad underused.

The End.Well that's what you would think all Besson's film amounts too, given the hate and general negativity that pours down on it from many of the worlds cinematic sources. Well, look, it's not brilliant, but is it really the devil that many have painted it as? Not so say I. It's about as subtle as a sledgehammer all told, but Besson's study of the iconic\/infamous waif who did indeed expel the British hoards has gusto by the shed load. He nicely crafts the 15th century lands from which to tell his story, and then, to quote someone from another period epic, unleashes hell. Literally. Yep the British armies are stereotypically vile I bet Mel Gibson loves the Brit portrayals here, and the blood that is shed is vicious and borderline sick. But it works well in the context of Jeanne's prominent rise and subsequent fall, with her religious confliction deftly blending in with the blood being shed in the pursuit of liberation. Visually the film is a treat, and for action construction it holds up to be one of the better modern day historical epics in that department. But where's the substance?Ah, there's the big problem with the movie. Besson and his co-writer Andrew Birkin are so pre-occupied with the horrors of war and Jeanne's leadership qualities, they turn the rest of the film into a skeleton in need of flesh. And it's actually Jovovich who suffers the most. She's great when she's screaming and launching into the enemy, taking an arrow hit with grace and dedication . But there's been no character depth laid out, so Jovovich's Jeanne just comes across as a moody teenager out to cause trouble. We need to have some insight into her troubled predicament and what drives her on, not the scantily written filler moments that actually are just appetisers to blood letting battles. There 's also annoyances when the film slips into moments of modern day speak, it's a crass and lazy oversight by the makers to think that we wouldn't notice such speak in 15th Century France. Besson surrounds Jovovich with some fine acting talent tho, even if some are a tad underused. Rolling out are John Malkovich, Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway, Vincent Cassel, Timothy West, Desmond Harrington and the always watchable, and scary, Tcheky Karyo.So a bit hollow it be, but on the outside it's a ripper.

On the other hand, if you have not, it is a little difficult to determine if you will enjoy it or not. What I can say is that this is *not* mainstream or Hollywood. If anything, it mocks the traditions of such. This is tasteless, sick, twisted fun, spoofing and satirizing the army, politics, the media, religion, etc. It also contains homages to the campy sci-fi flicks of the 50's, though you really don't need to be particularly familiar with those to get into this(I'm not, and I laugh my head off). This was my second viewing, and the other time was at least half a decade ago, and yet I remembered nearly everything(and the humor still worked for me, in spite of me knowing the punchlines). That doesn't happen all that often. The comedy is *hilarious*(with some exceptions that miss the mark), with silly and goofy material, absurdity, brilliantly written dialog and absolutely *no* holding back. This has a magnificent cast(all of them clearly in on it, aware of what the final product would be) and the characters are distinguished and memorable, and all the archetypes are there. The acting is spot-on for nearly every performance; Tom Jones isn't entirely convincing, but it doesn't get to be terribly bothersome. This never stands still, there is a ton of energy in it, and the pacing is fast without being overwhelming. The special effects are good, if you can tell that CGI was relatively new at this point, and the integration between the FX and the live-action elements is reasonable at best. There is plenty of moderately violent and disturbing content, a little mild language and brief(not graphic) sexuality in this. I recommend it to anyone who can imagine that they'd like it. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 January 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" If you have seen a Burton film before, you have an idea of what to expect.
