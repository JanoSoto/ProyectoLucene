","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"20 January 2003","score":"","review":"  *** Contains Spoilers ****sigh*  Philip K Dick was one of the finest, maybe even the finest SF writer of the second half of the 20th century. The science fiction movie of the 90's has just caught up with what Dick was doing in the 50's and 60's. Films like The Matrix, The Truman Show, Dark City, Pleasantville, and The Thirteenth Floor are so obviously and totally inspired by PKD and his endless interrogation of the nature of reality that I really think if he were alive, Dick could probably just file suit against Hollywood in general. NONE of these movies credit Dick in any way, and they're ALL good. So why, oh why, whenever someone gets hold of an actual PKD story and film it, do they make such a mess of it? (Bladerunner excepted, but Dick was still alive for that one).Minority report has one great thing going for it the central idea of citizens being arrested and punished for crimes they HAVEN'T YET COMMITTED, on evidence provided by gifted precognitives. Unfortunately it's the only really good thing about Minority Report the movie, and Steven Spielberg had nothing to do with it.Most of my criticisms have been covered below. Inconsistent, uninteresting future world, bad pacing, lapses into sentimentality (and stupid gags), irritating, overexposed cinematography (I've watched films in sepia before, but this is the first one I've watched in chrome), and some really bad plot holes.Oh, BTW, before I get on to the big spoiler - I realised something while watching this movie. I'm sick of CGI. I really am. This movie is like the last Star Wars. Every outdoor scene is crammed with billions of things whizzing all over the damn place, and what's more they somehow just don't look real. I don't find this exciting anymore; I just find it tiring. Compare this maelstrom of whizzing whatnots with the sparse, ominous sets in Kubrick's 2001.Ok.... QUITE A MAJOR SPOILER COMINGI admit that if I have read PKD's original story Minority Report, it must have been 20 years ago, and I don't recall it. I mostly read his novels. But I am willing to guess that Dick would have gone some way to explaining this scenario, if indeed it existed in his storyTom Cruise's character has been accused of a murder he is yet to commit. The supposed victim is someone he doesn't even know, and he rightly rationalises that it's unlikely he would be going to commit this murder. It's due to happen in about 20 hours, and meanwhile he has escaped and is on the run.

At least go in town where it's probably safer....even if you think it's the end of the world, I'd rather be with a bunch of people, then all alone with my brother and 2 kids in the middle of nowhere, fighting these aliens.4.These aliens come from god knows where, have built a technology that we probably will not see here for centuries to come..... you're going to tell me that they can't figure a way to get through a basement door...c'mooooooooooon.5. These ultra-intelligent beings have only vapors to kill us.....they haven't developed weapons.......what the hell...they build flying saucers that travel millions of miles that can render themselves invisible, but they don't have any weapons(even if it's ground war, they can use some type of weapons without provoking us to use nuclear weapons)6. Knowing (I would assume that with their intelligence they would know that earth and every living being on it is made up of 80% water) what water does to them, you would think they would have developed some kind of protection to H2O.I think the bottom line is I should have watched this movie once only.

As with all of Mr. Shyamalan's movies, you end up realizing that you've been watching a different movie than what you thought you were watching when the end arrives, and he always pulls it off with great skill and a different twist.  The man clearly loves to tell a good story, and Signs is as good a movie as they make with a great story.  The performances are spectacular, even from the kids, and the effects are simple and understated, but they pay off.  I won't provide any spoilers here, but the film deals with the possibility of alien invasion and takes off from there into philosophy and faith and a whole bunch of other stuff.
