Stripped of his title after refusing to fight in Vietnam, and subsequently beaten on his return to the ring, he went on to reclaim his world titles, before retiring and (very probably as a direct result of his long career) developing a form of Parkinson's disease. With such a rich biography, a film of Ali's life should by rights be among the greatest of movies, but sadly, 'Ali' has been made by Michael Mann, a director whose work is both middlebrow and pretentious it always seems to be making a point about saying something, without actually saying very much at all. For this film, Mann has chosen to construct a collage of scenes from Ali's life, set to music, rather than to build a conventional narrative. It's an odd approach to those utterly unfamiliar with the events of Ali's life, I suspect the film would seem baffling yet there's little in the way of deep insight into Ali's character to compensate. Indeed, while Will Smith, an actor who usually features in comic movie, shows (and not for the first time) that he can play straight, in his hands Ali is (whisper is softly) almost a little dull the playful menace of the original is mimicked but not matched.And some of Mann's decisions I just don't understand. The film begins, for example, with a handful of dialogue-free scenes prior to showing us Ali's first big fight. The fight thus begins before the film has had a chance to induce any sort of emotional attachment to the character. And the stylised representation of the fighting itself comprises the most boring representation of boxing on screen that I have ever seen. Personally, I'm no great fan of the sport, but there's a visceral quality in evidence when you watch any real fight on television that just isn't conveyed here. In part, this is because Mann seems determined to eschew narrative potential at all times, as if to ensure his film is never a sporting melodrama, even when he is reconstructing exactly such an event in real life. For example in Sylvester Stallone's film 'Rocky', hardly a classic of cinema, a key element of the fight scenes is the depiction of the ring girls, who parade with the number of each round before it begins. They naturally add to the narrative tension for the audience, pacing us through the fight. In the final fight shown in 'Ali' (the famous Ali-Foreman encounter in Zaire), we also see the ring girls but they hold their numbers off camera, so we have no idea how long the fight has to go. If unintentional, his would be so incompetent I can only assume it is deliberate; but rather baffling, nonetheless. By contrast, the purpose of using uplifting, spiritual African music to accompany the Zairean scenes is, on the other hand, crassly obvious. The film thus seems to aspire to force us to assign a certain higher meaning to the events it depicts; yet has no interest in milking the basic story for its innate drama. Instead of showing us how things were, and leaving us to ponder why Ali became an icon, the film serves us a legendary, but vaguely defined, hero. The failure to even mention Ali's later suffering (in spite of a what happened next caption at the end of the film) seems cowardly and wrong.For all that, Ali's story remains mesmerising. But this film made me want to watch a proper documentary instead.

The things that don't work or the things that are totally ridiculous are the very reasons to watch the movie. It's an absolute mess and a helluva good time because of it. The plot - don't worry about the plot. It might make your head explode if you think too much about it. I'll give it a try, but you've been warned. Since the events of the first movie, Regan (Linda Blair) has grown to be a teenager with some sort of mental problems and a desire to perform in really bad musicals. Her mother has disappeared leaving her in the care of Dr. Tuskin (Louise Fletcher). Dr. Tuskin's idea of treatment is to have Regan stare at a blinking light bulb until she enters into a trance like state. Father Lamont (Richard Burton) shows up to study Regan's case and to announce at every opportunity he can find that there is still an eeeevil presence inside Regan. From this point forward, you really need to see it to believe it.John Boorman had what many people would consider one of the best horror movies ever made to work with when making the sequel. But at every opportunity, he takes Exorcist II into some of the most ridiculous places imaginable. He tries to get artsy, but fails miserably and ends up making scenes that should be horrific come off as silly. Take the scene where Father Lamont snaps and goes after Regan. What should have been a shocking moment is instead incredibly funny. I'm convinced that no matter how hard you tried you couldn't make a sequel this bad on purpose.The cast doesn't help Boorman at all. None of the three main leads escapes this movie looking good. First, there's Richard Burton. He chews through this movie and spits it out like a John Deere through foot high grass. Burton looks like a buffoon who overacts almost every moment he appears on screen. Next, there's Linda Blair. I like Linda Blair, but I've never thought she was much of an actress. And she proves this in Exorcist II. Her lines are delivered with all the conviction of a prostitute in church. And those dance numbers are just short of painful. Finally, Louise Fletcher acts throughout much of the movie as if she would rather be anywhere other than here. She comes across as bored, uninterested, and embarrassed to be part of this debacle.There's no end to what I could write about this movie, but I'll stop here.

Burton looks like a buffoon who overacts almost every moment he appears on screen. Next, there's Linda Blair. I like Linda Blair, but I've never thought she was much of an actress. And she proves this in Exorcist II. Her lines are delivered with all the conviction of a prostitute in church. And those dance numbers are just short of painful. Finally, Louise Fletcher acts throughout much of the movie as if she would rather be anywhere other than here. She comes across as bored, uninterested, and embarrassed to be part of this debacle.There's no end to what I could write about this movie, but I'll stop here. One of the best reviews I've ever read can be found here - http\/\/twtd.bluemountains.net.au\/Rick\/exorcist2.htm. You owe it to yourself to check it out.

What differs this movie from others is the realism and that it's very believable. I thought 2 1\/2 hour would be a long time, but time really flies when you're having fun! The movie follows the Carleone family, a good old Italian-American mafia family. The year is 1946 and the drug-market is just opening. When the Carleone refuses to take any part in this business some of the ones counting on this get's mad.The movie is based on the book by Mario Puzo. It's a well written movie. A smart thing to let Mario Puzo do the screenplay as he knows all the characters and the story inside and out. The story is not a simple one and there are quite a few characters. That might make the story confusing, but if you just pay attention you'll do fine. The characters and the combination of characters are great. We have a kind of anti-hero (Michael), the boss (Don Vito), the trigger happy (Sonny), the bystander (Hagen) and more. That gives plenty of opportunities for conflicts between them. The characters are very believable and you get to know them, what kind of persons they are. The story and action is also very good. You get caught up and dragged into another world. The dialog, witch is important to this movie is well written. It's not that typical movie where everyone knows what to say at any time. There are silence and thought-breaks, that makes it all more casual and normal.The actors are very good. The have settled for nothing less than quality actors in all roles. They use Italian-Americans and that makes it all more believable. Marlon Brando and does a good job and will forever be remembered as Don Carleone. Al Pachino's performance is nothing less than great. The rest of the cast are also very good an delivers a very good performance.The cinematography is classic. There are nothing really special about it, but it's all over good. The composition is good and the lightning is nice. They've captured the mood very well. It's not happy, it's not dark, it's something in between. There are no shots that stands out in a bad way, so you don't really pay attention to it. You just focus on the story.The sets, decoration and costumes are incredible. It's very realistic. It's 40's all the way, yet you don't really think about it. You never stop to think that this is the 40's. It all just comes natural. It really helps you get caught up in the movie. Not once do you think why don't he just pick up a cell phone?, because it all seem so realistic and well done.Nino Rota has made a forever memorable score. It's classic and easy to recognize. It makes a nice, kind of gloomy mood, and fits the rest of the movie perfect. I also like the lack of music. In the action scenes there are no music. This makes it more tense, personal and human.There are some special effects in this movies. Some blood, fights, shots and explosions, but it not that much. What there is is rather good. Some it has a little theatrical look to it and therefor I'm glad they didn't make a big deal out of it. The fact that they don't literally overkill and focus on this makes the story more serious and much more believable. This movie is no action movie, but 100% drama at it's finest.The Godfater is a classic, must-see movie for everyone. It has a special place in movie history. It almost a legend.

I have long believed that this movie achieved what nobody else had managed - to open the eyes of the world to what was really happening in South Africa. I consider myself to be a normal right thinking person and I can attest to how this film changed my whole way of thinking about not just South Africa, but how we as white people perceive black people. I have never seen any difference between people of any colour or creed, but after viewing this film I physically changed my life and have spent the last 17 years living in a predominantly black country and helping many people rise above their present standard of living and achieve that which they would not have thought possible. The greatest reward I can honestly say I have received - to be able to say that in my own small way I have contributed and redressed the balance a little. But if more people thought like me and actually DID something to help black people without seeking reward then the entire black population of this planet would be a little better off.I challenge any right thinking person to watch Cry Freedom from beginning to end and not feel that emotion tugging at your heartstrings as you witness the 700 schoolchildren brutally shot dead in Sharpville for refusing to learn Afrikaans, the senseless murder of Steve Biko, such a champion for his own people's rights, and then, ultimately, to understand that all this is not merely a film, albeit a magnificent one, but that it all actually happened and less than 30 years ago.Yes, my friends, watch this movie and then see if you can go out afterwards and party hard.

As the shark makes his deadly threats (and lunch) a crusty old sea dog named Quint comes along and offers to kill the shark. City council and mayor Larry Vaughn decline and instead bring in Matt Hooper, a marine biologist and shark buff who quickly proves wrong the committee whenever they try to cover up the slaughter. Finally, when a group of boys (including the mayor's son) then comes within the stinking breath of death and chum, the mayor gives in and pays Quint, Martin and Hooper to hunt out and finally destroy the ravenous beast. But do they make it?As a master of suggestive art, Spielberg used this ability to make Jaws into one of the most memorable films in movie history. With an excellent original music score, he turns an entirely stupid looking foam shark into a beast of terror. To aid the horror of how vicious this chunk of foam is, he also adds great emotion to the faces of characters such as in the autopsy scene where Hooper was observing what was left of the first victim. Though you never see the remains of the victim, his face contortions into many disturbed expressions, and a gallon of sweat dribbiting down his forehead clearly state that this shark is the Beelzebub of all sharks. He uses this technique throughout the whole film, and he never shows until the climax the dreaded foam shark.The film's overall idea is ridiculous, but the movie itself is great . The conflict growing inside the Chief is irkingly good because he shows in such a clever way. An entire juice glass of a heavy red wine and he downs it faster than the shark downs Quint. This shows the stress of how the town is all relying on him to solve the problem that is this menace and if he fails, what will they all do? Will there by another Kittner boy's mother, no son and hating him for it. Only he can't close the beaches because city council won't let him. This confusion helps viewers relate to the movie. Personally, I thought the movie was great. His use of music to build tension and only silhouetting the shark to hide it's overall stupidity was an absolutely brilliant maneuver, and even though the main idea sucks, the suggestion makes the move an all-time summer favorite.Kristen Stenvik ","genre":null},{"date":"26 October 2005","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Jaws was directed by Steven Spielberg.

Remember when Pixar didn't have stereotypical surfers and rappers? It was when the characters were fun and familiar. They didn't waste out time with farting jokes, but instead had smart jokes that weren't overdone. (even if they were more geared towards adults.) Luckily, we still have one good, classic Pixar movie; Toy Story. Peter Doctor knows how to make a fun and enjoyable family movie.Woody, is the top toy of Andy's bedroom. He leads meeting and events, and is one of the most popular toys there. But, then, Andy has a birthday party. Everybody is worried about getting replaced by a toy, but Woody assures them that there is nothing to be worried about. Funny, how he ends up getting replaced by Buzz Lightyear-the new popular toy. Ironic, huh? So, he gets jealous and tries to kill Buzz, by setting up a trap and pushing him out the window. Then, the other toys find out, and think Let's kill Woody! Wow, the irony in it all! The only way the toys will forgive him, is if he brings Buzz back. So, Woody and Buzz meet up at Pizza Palace. After exploring a bit, they get caught by Sid-the sick and twisted kid next door.But, what makes this movie so good? Toy Story isn't your average kids' film. It seems to have a message in it all.

But unlike the original movie involving the attempt to lose one's virginity before leaving high school, this one takes advantage of the strong personality traits of the characters we loved from the first movie. In fact, the only thing AP2 inherits from the original blockbuster, besides the cast & characters, is the raunchiness of the original movie that uptight moralists hate so much. Among these uptight people are neo-confederate columnist Charley Reese who thinks that Hollywood didn't produce movies like this 20 years earlier. What planet was he living on when ANIMAL HOUSE, MEATBALLS, and PORKY'S came out? Better yet, where was he when AP1 came out?To tell you the truth, it's a good thing that the sequel has these cast & characters, because the idea of their goal being the ultimate party, seems a little thin for a plot. But it's the events that take place before the party that make this movie so good. Stifler is still a jerk, Kevin still longs for Vicky, Oz and Heather are trying to stay faithful to each other, Vicky is getting more advice on men from Jessica, Sherman still thinks calling himself The Sherminator impresses the ladies, Finch still longs for Stifler's Mom(despite his own sexual escapades), Jim is being embarrassed by his dad, getting a visit from Nadia, and decides to get sex tips from none other than that lovable nerdy flutist horn-dog Michelle. As I stated earlier, the events leading up to the party are what makes this sequel so good. When one of Stifler's parties finally gets raided by the cops(something which happens more often at other parties according to two guests), Kevin calls up his big brother for advice and he suggests holding another one at a rental house on Lake Michigan. Once this party goes down, Kevin is supposed to be able to see the big picture whatever that is. Prior to the Lake Michigan blowout, Finch learns the secret of Stifler's Mom's skills in the bedroom, and tries them out himself, which makes him an easy target for The Stiff-meister. And when he's not insulting Finch(or Jessica), Stifler does everything he can to get Oz to be unfaithful to Heather while she's on a trip to Spain. But no, he just won't budge! To pay for this future party, the kids decide to get a job painting houses, including one owned by two young ladies who live together, and are assumed by Stifler to be lesbians. Of course I'd be lying if I said that Adam Herz tried to make EVERYTHING about AP2 different from AP1, because the mutual bi-sexual foreplay being broadcast all over every CB & two-way radio in AP2, is identical to the internet\/video-cam scene from AP1. And while Kevin still wants both the body and heart of Vicky again, Michelle gladly offers to provide lover's tips to Jim so he can score with Nadia. Of course, her REAL motive for helping Jim becomes clearer as the movie progresses. A lot of people were upset about the fact that Jim dumped that Central European brunette bombshell Nadia for that nerdy, naughty flute-playing Michelle, but I was upset about the fact that Kevin and Vicky didn't become lovers again. Kevin truly loved this girl, and we're supposed to believe that unless he stops feeling this way he's too immature to be a high school graduate? I say that's more disgusting than any jokes about bodily functions and masturbation mishaps. Other than that, it's still an adequate sequel, which is something you don't always find coming out of Hollywood.

Based on on the book Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad.

As the film progresses the viewer is confronted with numerous scenes raging from insanity to chaos, which not only shock, but make you reflect and sometimes even disturb you. An example is when they come to an outpost, the soldiers jump in the water screaming to be taken away from their perspective of hell. Another scene, is when Lance puts war paint on.

After the previews finished and we were instructed to put the glasses on, there was a brief shot of a virtual theater in 3D, then it ended! Several members of the audience, including me, said in unison, That was it?That more or less describes my feelings about The Blair Witch Project. When it first came out in the summer of '99, a fellow told me that it was the scariest film he'd ever seen. That's what many critics had indicated as well. Since I love being scared, I eagerly went to the theater, thinking I was in for the experience of a lifetime.The movie tells the story of three college kids who do a research assignment, go on a long camping trip into the woods, and ultimately lose their way. As I watched the kids grow increasingly panicky and finally get separated, my interest began to perk...and then the movie just ended! I sat there in confusion. That was it? Where was the fear that everyone spoke about?My complaint is not that the film lacked violence. On the contrary, I'm genuinely tired of the sort of horror film where explicit gore substitutes for true terror. I believe that the most effective horror movies leave a lot to the imagination. Shortly after seeing The Blair Witch Project, I saw The Sixth Sense, which scared the pants off me without containing much explicit violence. A movie does not need violence in order to be scary, and, indeed, too much violence can detract from a movie's suspense. But one thing a good horror movie absolutely must do is establish a real threat, something that The Blair Witch Project does not do.In the early scenes, I was unable to make sense out of the local legends the kids were investigating. The stories that the residents tell are unconvincing and contradictory. One resident talks about seeing a white misty thing, another describes what he saw as an old woman whose feet never touched the ground. This is the kind of naiveté associated with popular folklore like the Loch Ness Monster, and I could not connect any of it with the movie's later events.While we are told that the kids were never found, the footage presents no clear-cut evidence that anything actually happens in the woods, other than that the kids get lost. In one scene, Heather begins screaming frantically at something she finds in a pile of leaves. I later found out that she was supposed to have seen severed human parts, but that was far from clear to me. Fans somehow piece together the various sections of the film and concoct a coherent story of supernatural murder, but to me it looked more like a case of hysteria than an encounter with a Blair Witch.Despite my criticisms, this isn't a bad film. As a fake documentary, it is well-made. The kids look, talk, and act like real college students. While not scary, the film is far from boring. I enjoyed watching the story progress while giving the appearance of being something spontaneous.Curiously, the Razzie awards nominated both this film and Heather Donahue's performance as the worst of 1999, one of the few times I've disagreed with their selections. We tend to overlook how hard it is for actors to act like they're not acting. People who argue that Donahue's performance was over-the-top have never, I suspect, seen someone panic. There was not a moment in the film that felt wrong or fake to me. Perhaps the reason I didn't get scared is that I felt smarter than these characters, who behave in ways that I do not think I would have behaved in the same situation. But I still found their reactions plausible.If I was disappointed, it was only because the hype surrounding this film gave me a certain set of expectations, which failed to solidify. This movie was an early demonstration of the power of the Internet, a cheap $20,000 production that never would have attained so much popularity if not for a website that helped propagate the legend to the public as something real.

Fans somehow piece together the various sections of the film and concoct a coherent story of supernatural murder, but to me it looked more like a case of hysteria than an encounter with a Blair Witch.Despite my criticisms, this isn't a bad film. As a fake documentary, it is well-made. The kids look, talk, and act like real college students. While not scary, the film is far from boring. I enjoyed watching the story progress while giving the appearance of being something spontaneous.Curiously, the Razzie awards nominated both this film and Heather Donahue's performance as the worst of 1999, one of the few times I've disagreed with their selections. We tend to overlook how hard it is for actors to act like they're not acting. People who argue that Donahue's performance was over-the-top have never, I suspect, seen someone panic. There was not a moment in the film that felt wrong or fake to me. Perhaps the reason I didn't get scared is that I felt smarter than these characters, who behave in ways that I do not think I would have behaved in the same situation. But I still found their reactions plausible.If I was disappointed, it was only because the hype surrounding this film gave me a certain set of expectations, which failed to solidify. This movie was an early demonstration of the power of the Internet, a cheap $20,000 production that never would have attained so much popularity if not for a website that helped propagate the legend to the public as something real. It was more than just a film it was an act of showmanship. This all amounted to an interesting demonstration, but not the sort of film I expect will endure.

But aside from the fact that I watched it during the last few hours of normalcy, it also seems to mirror the world today. With this movie, Robert Altman did what he often does look deep into something that people often take for granted. In this case, he does an expose of country music's capital, and the cynicism that was clearly pervading America in the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate era, and is once again taking over due to everything related to the Iraq War.As with every one of Altman's movies, everyone is talking at once (due to the fact that Altman lets his actors and actresses develop their own characters). The story is told through the eyes of several people, played by Henry Gibson, Ronee Blakely, Ned Beatty, Lily Tomlin, Keith Carradine, Barbara Harris, Shelley Duvall, and others. Elliott Gould even has a bit part as himself.Maybe Nashville isn't Altman's best movie ever, but it's certainly worth seeing.

What follows is the aftermath of it all as they reflect how they got there and what they are going to do now. I put the follows in quotes, because the robbery is the inciting incident to the main story, but interestingly this film has plenty of back story that develops as we see how each of the robbers wound up pulling the job and the whole film is very broken up chronologically. Interestingly Tarantino makes it work and each back-story or reflection is clever and the whole mass of all the flashbacks, some pertaining directly to the robbery some not, make for a big picture showing who these lowlifes really are.Now that's another thing lowlifes. The protagonists are essentially that. Uneducated, career crooks, that can't hold a regular job or go straight. Basically people that no one is too interested in, but Tarantino treats them like fair human beings and it is admittedly strange to see people like this with a human or humorous side and to see how they justify to themselves what they do for a living. I have heard this film bashed (along with Pulp Fiction) for the pointlessness of its conversations, but if you think about it, life is full of conversations that you forget the next day. And what do you expect gun totting crooks to discuss? Something that a regular person would consider meaningful to their life? While I do agree many of the dialogs are tedious and don't really relate to my life or anyone else that I know, they paint a believable human image of people we'd like to do away with.This film is based on Ringo Lam's City on Fire, starring Chow Yun-Fat, but out of the two Reservoir Dogs is definitely better.
