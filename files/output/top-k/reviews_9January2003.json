It focuses on Justine (Jennifer Anniston) who works at Retail Rodeo, hates her job, has a toad of a house-painter husband Phil who, with his best buddy Bubba, smokes pot and gets high after work while staining the couch with not-quite-dry paint, and the local haute cuisine is Senor Tuna restaurant.  With that as a quick summary it should be obvious that the story will delve into some very funny situations, which it does. Although filmed in California, a big Texas state flag on the wall and talk of the Dallas Cowboys makes it clear where the story takes place.One reason I like the film so much is that it has a genuine feel to it. Real life can alternate from the very funny to the very tragic and back to the very funny all in one day. Real people don't talk like a David Mamet script, nor do they always make the right decision when faced with a crisis. Justine is that kind of real character. She brings her husband to bible study but, when she sees the motel clerk there quickly tells Phil, We have to go right now.  We forgot our bibles at home.  While she thinks she and the young clerk are having a discrete, secret affair, she eventually finds out that almost everyone knows about it, except her simple, trusting husband. She didn't think of the security camera in the storeroom. Or that Bubba would follow them to the motel. Does it make logical sense that Justine would fall into an affair, although reluctantly, with a mentally unstable 22-year-old clerk?  No, it doesn't. But none of Justine's existence makes sense at that point. She is trapped in a small town, in a job she hates, with a nice man for a husband who doesn't have a clue that Justine may need some attention. When she complains at one point that the TV reception is bad, he promptly gets a new antenna and fixes it, proudly asking, Did you notice that the TV is fixed?It would be wrong to say The Good Girl condones adultry. Justine didn't even want to let Holden kiss her at first, pulling away and saying I'm married, I have a husband.  Her giving in is a result of her depression, her feeling her dead-end job and her toad of a husband closing in on her. But once she crosses the line, she and the young boy are like eager rabbits.  Emotionally she wanted the relationship to continue, but her logical side knew there could be no future for them, even if she left Phil.  I suspect the whole story isn't too far from what often happens in real life.SPOILERS -- At the story's climax Justine does the right thing (good girl, film's title) by telling police where they could find Holden, who was waiting for her with the $20,000 he stole from the store's safe and his parents. Cornered, he shot himself. Justine ends up pregnant, Phil's sperm test shows him to be unable to have children, he never finds out about Holden. In the last scene it shows Justine and Phil with their baby, happy. Phil never was depicted as a bad husband, just an oblivious one. We can assume their married life turned out better, and Holden's role was a lasting one.The DVD picture, in widescreen, is very good. The 5.1 surround is mainly front sound, except for rain one time in the rears. The deleted scenes and outtakes were mildly interesting.  I didn't listen to the commentary tracks.

I think it's way to simple and it's view on faith is way to simplistic and kinda dull and pandering. I like alot of how the movie is filmed though. I think it builds tension well and has some creepy and somewhat scary moments but in the end it's paper thin story just does not give much reason to care. For it to have worked as a thriller it needed to be much more dark and driven in its structure i think.M Night says he based it on the birds and night of the living dead and invasion of the body snatchers(1956), but it comes across more as Watcher in the woods but without all the thrills and violence that watcher had. You think I'm kidding but I'm not. *****Possible Spoilers***** The them of the film which seems to be the ability to regain your faith after tragic things have happened in your life  or how people keep faith in thier lives has been done much better in other films. I would say david cronenbergs movie CRASH is about how people keep faith in a world that seems devoid of things to trust or believe in. It shows this very well and in a very interesting way without lying to audience with sappy rhetoric. Speaking of which i think It's a wonderful life sappy as it is is a much better film about the same thing. It has much more character and feeling than Signs even attempts to. Also films like The addiction and Bad Lieutenant provide questions and answers about lost faith in much more honest terms. I don't know what i was supposed to get out of signs but i would much rather watch invaders from mars myself. if anyone else got something out of this more than the overly simple theme then kudos to you because i dont think the director is clever enough to put more into it and having just watched the documentary with the dvd, called making of signs, he proves my point. Lets hope Mr. Nights next film tries to explore something a bit deeper than this one did. Don't get me wrong the themes of faith and losing one's faith are deep but the way they are treated in Signs is not. A great comparison to find out what i am talking about would be to watch the other films i listed right after signs or better yet watch mike leighs Naked that should get ya thinking.

This is my favorite David Lean film, with Dr. Zhivago running a close second. Steven Spielberg has mentioned that this is one of the movies he watches again before he sets out to make a new movie. And one can see why. I think perhaps the test of a truly great movie is that it bears repeated viewings. The desert vistas are stunning and clean, the characters round and well-developed--even the minor ones, the soundtrack moving, the acting superlative, and the dialogue superb. While this movie may not be 100% accurate to how things really were (Lawrence was short and shy), who cares? It's not often that someone has a destiny to fulfill. This movie, better than almost any other I know, captures a man's destiny. And poor Peter O'Toole. When a film like this is your breakout role, how can you go anywhere else but down?

The special restored 2-DVD version is superb and accurate but as such it transmits some of the defects that have crept onto the print that could not be eliminated in the restoration. There are also portions of dialogue that had to be re-recorded, and it sometimes shows. We can at least be thankful that the restoration occurred when it did and not any later.

When he wins they decide to do it again for real.  A chance encounter with author Geoffrey Chaucer brings them a herald but also forced papers of nobility.  As William (now called Sir Ulrich) keeps winning he has two things on his mind &#150; winning the hand of Princess Jocelyn and beating the world champion, Count Adhemar.  However the rest are only worried about money and not being uncovered as peasants.My wife bought this film on DVD because all her friends had told her how brilliant it was.  Happily the shop let us exchange it for something else and my wife learnt the valuable lesson of not taking the advice of people who only watch movies on a Friday night and are happy with any old tat that doesn't require thought.  The plot is pretty thin considering the 120+ minute running time.  It moves along with a certain amount of energy but if 30 minutes in both  of us had guessed the ending and were getting bored waiting for it.The jousts lack real excitement &#150; they are filmed well to make them seem more exciting but really how many times can you watch a man fall off a horse or get hit by wood.  This isn't helped by us knowing the outcome of every fight before it happens (predictable) and really knwoing where the story is going.  It has energy but not much more &#150; however it seems to be aimed at the MTV crowd who don't `do' historical.  So we have Queen, funky dances etc all thrown in to keep the thing moving.  It's amusing but all that stuff felt so very out of place that the styles didn't merge well.The characters are fairly bland and again didn't help me get into the story at all.  I never doubted that William would come good at the end or that the evil Adhemar would get his.  Of course it is predictable &#150; but don't we always know the good guy will win.  The difference is a well written story will still have drama and tension &#150; we'll want the good guy to win, rather than just KNOW he will.  Ledger does a very bland job as William.  His accent seems to have taken away any character he may have had.  He has a few good scenes but I have seen him in other things where he is much better.  Sewell is awful &#150; just a cartoon villain who has no teeth, only a sneer that he brings out at any chance.  Sossamon is really cute and sassy, Addy is funny but Tudyk is a poor character &#150; only funny when being comically violent.  For me the saviour of the piece was Bettany.Bettany seemed to know that this film was never going to be serious and just decided to have fun with the role.  His Chaucer is so refreshing beside Ledger's straight hero.  Sure he hams it up and goes a little OTT but he knows he's doing this and has great fun.  I enjoyed him even when the film dipped.Overall this is not terrible but it is simply average at best.  It is funny without being hilarious, the running time was too generous for all you get and neither the jousts or the romance really involved or gripped me.  Only the delightful whimsical acting of Bettany kept me watching this.  Average.

It is funny without being hilarious, the running time was too generous for all you get and neither the jousts or the romance really involved or gripped me.  Only the delightful whimsical acting of Bettany kept me watching this.  Average.

review useful","review":"  Steve Martin has once again proved himself worthy by acting very well in a comedy. The movie itself, however, doesn't do as well. You see, Martin is a dentist named Frank Sangster who is quite successful. He has many people and hygienists working under him, including his girlfriend Jean (Laura Dern). However, one day Susan Ivey (Helena Bonham Carter) wanders into his office, needing a root canal, but gets lots of drugs instead. Frank is getting scrutinized for, supposedly, selling drugs to patients. Soon, he gets involved in murder and falls in way over his head.The major flaw of this movie? Not funny. I laughed a couple times, but I suspect almost all of them were forced, because I thought they were humorous, but not enough to make me chuckle, or even snort. Martin is, of course, best in comedies, but to make them work, he needs more than his name and face. He does have great comedic timing, but he just couldn't pull it off. Not to say he wasn't bad at acting, he just didn't make me laugh. Carter, though nowhere near her performance in Fight Club, did a very good job, and she seemed to have chemistry with Martin. Dern, however, seemed to be out of place, and just went in and out of the movie at times. That brings me to my next point, which is a good thing. Many of the events that occur early on in the movie that you wouldn't even remember come back later and become involved in the story.There were lots of scenes, with cool transitions in between them, with a few of them being X-Rays of the characters as they are moving, but others are a purple bar that sweeps across. Very cool. Martin provides a narration that is scarce and would have been better if it had been more widely used or not used at all. And, many of the plot developments were somewhat heavy for a comedy (no matter how dark). Novocaine relied on mayhem to make us laugh, which I didn't buy.I also thought it seemed like Martin was trying to reach to an older audience (more than the teenagers) by constant swearing that was not necessary. It also had many grisly images that I didn't think needed to belong there (also included is that teddy bear&#133;brrr). Maybe it would have been better if Martin had made this as a drama (which would have worked), because of its dark comedy style that seems to overtake it sometimes. Many secondary characters were unnecessary.I did, however, like the mystery that overtook the story. I found it more enjoyable than the supposed humor. The ending, nonetheless, had everything explained and wrapped up in a nice little package and express shipped to our hearts (well, maybe not that last part) and was unsatisfactory. If it had been more ambiguous, it would be able to be more believable. I was thinking, all the way through the movie, that everyone tried way too hard to make a substantial comedy. A character's breakdown at the end didn't make be believe him\/her.`Pretty funny, huh?' a character asks during the movie, when another gives a negative response.

The movie itself, however, doesn't do as well. You see, Martin is a dentist named Frank Sangster who is quite successful. He has many people and hygienists working under him, including his girlfriend Jean (Laura Dern). However, one day Susan Ivey (Helena Bonham Carter) wanders into his office, needing a root canal, but gets lots of drugs instead. Frank is getting scrutinized for, supposedly, selling drugs to patients. Soon, he gets involved in murder and falls in way over his head.The major flaw of this movie? Not funny. I laughed a couple times, but I suspect almost all of them were forced, because I thought they were humorous, but not enough to make me chuckle, or even snort. Martin is, of course, best in comedies, but to make them work, he needs more than his name and face. He does have great comedic timing, but he just couldn't pull it off. Not to say he wasn't bad at acting, he just didn't make me laugh. Carter, though nowhere near her performance in Fight Club, did a very good job, and she seemed to have chemistry with Martin. Dern, however, seemed to be out of place, and just went in and out of the movie at times. That brings me to my next point, which is a good thing. Many of the events that occur early on in the movie that you wouldn't even remember come back later and become involved in the story.There were lots of scenes, with cool transitions in between them, with a few of them being X-Rays of the characters as they are moving, but others are a purple bar that sweeps across. Very cool. Martin provides a narration that is scarce and would have been better if it had been more widely used or not used at all. And, many of the plot developments were somewhat heavy for a comedy (no matter how dark). Novocaine relied on mayhem to make us laugh, which I didn't buy.I also thought it seemed like Martin was trying to reach to an older audience (more than the teenagers) by constant swearing that was not necessary. It also had many grisly images that I didn't think needed to belong there (also included is that teddy bear&#133;brrr). Maybe it would have been better if Martin had made this as a drama (which would have worked), because of its dark comedy style that seems to overtake it sometimes. Many secondary characters were unnecessary.I did, however, like the mystery that overtook the story. I found it more enjoyable than the supposed humor. The ending, nonetheless, had everything explained and wrapped up in a nice little package and express shipped to our hearts (well, maybe not that last part) and was unsatisfactory. If it had been more ambiguous, it would be able to be more believable. I was thinking, all the way through the movie, that everyone tried way too hard to make a substantial comedy. A character's breakdown at the end didn't make be believe him\/her.`Pretty funny, huh?' a character asks during the movie, when another gives a negative response.

A couple in a car. The woman asks herself out loud, why girls need braces just at the time of their life when appearance means the most to them. Then, wham, a car crash.That's a brilliant opening. Almost too good, because it's a tough act to follow. The film fails, losing its charge quite quickly, by settling in a far too recognizable presentation. Not until half way into it, does it get on track again - but never to the extent that it matches the intro.During far too many minutes, it's simply hard to care, since everything is just too ordinary. It goes on being very ordinary, but about an hour into the film, there is at least some twist to it. Some good moments, though rare. The best one is when Sammy, the female lead, drives her car home after a secret rendez-vous with an unlikely lover, and bursts into sudden laughter. A wonderful laughter, saying such a lot.There are other scenes, where silence speaks fluently, through very skilled acting and a good sense of timing. There are some good actors in it. Matthew Broderick is very precise as a slightly repulsive boss worthy of a Freudian analysis, and still neither a monster nor a parody. Laura Linney also balances on the border between sympathetic and neurotic. And the boy, the younger Culcin, again makes me marvel at the Hollywood ability to make child actors perform so splendidly. I don't know how they do it, I'm not even sure I want to know.The weak one is Mark Ruffalo, playing the slightly Bohemian brother, but staying far too safely in the Prince Charming spectrum, whatever he does. It's really disturbing. If he could, at all, he should have allowed his character to be less agreeable, less safe. That was what the story seemed to call for.Well, the story is not that strong, either. It's pretty much a scramble of the usual drama cliches. Only at short moments does it stand out, like in how the Ruffalo character deals with the little boy's fantasy image of his absent father, or in the dialogue where the local priest tries to give him some spiritual guidance. That's a masterly dialogue, where both are allowed to say wise and reasonable things. An argument on such a high level, though brief, that there can be no winner of it.Otherwise, the film makes little impact. And the far too slow ending - naah, it is just a way of surrendering to the lack of a really good story.

The action and special effects of the 1932 classic have been massively increased, and the new film turns more to shocking special effects, often cheesy comic relief, and sparkling scenery, away from the slow, creeping tension of the original. As a result, we get a fast moving feature that places a lot of emphasis on its special effects and it's good-looking stars. Thankfully, the movie knows when to laugh at itself, but it trips because it doesn't know when to stop.The film starts roughly 3000 years in the past, with the Egyptian priest Imhotep being put to a rather vicious death for getting a little too friendly with the Pharaoh's mistress. Naturally, he is mummified alive, sealed in a coffin with a lot of flesh-eating beetles (the sounds of which make up some of the creepiest stuff in the whole movie), only to be accidentally resurrected by a lot of bounty hunters a few millennia later. This is where the cast comes in, Rick (Brendan Fraser), Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah).Rick is the hero of the movie, the guy who has been there and done it all and just wants to get his money and get out. He's kind of like a cross between the single-mindedness of Han Solo, the bad one-liners of James Bond, and the adventure experience of Indiana Jones, except that he comes across more as a muddy conglomeration of characters like those rather than an original character of his own. He goes through his part upset by the fact that other people seem to be constantly be holding him back from some faraway goal, the importance of which they can probably never be expected to understand. Evelyn is there mainly with scientific interest (until she meets the hottie hero and romance is added to her To Do list) and her brother Jonathan is there for pure financial gain, as is the movie's director and crew and production team. There is also a tagalong character named Beni who I can only satisfactorily describe as a greedy rat, someone you would expect to meet on the wet streets of New York in the 1940s or something. He is a constant double-crosser who never has anyone's but his own best interest in mind, and so naturally ends up working for the resurrected Imhotep. His weird eye-makeup and pathetically whiny little voice make him a perfect candidate for the throwaway antagonist, who Rick tries vainly to save in a climactic scene near the end of the film. The interesting thing about the plot comes up when you consider when exactly Imhotep became the bad guy.

The action and special effects of the 1932 classic have been massively increased, and the new film turns more to shocking special effects, often cheesy comic relief, and sparkling scenery, away from the slow, creeping tension of the original.

Thankfully, the movie knows when to laugh at itself, but it trips because it doesn't know when to stop.The film starts roughly 3000 years in the past, with the Egyptian priest Imhotep being put to a rather vicious death for getting a little too friendly with the Pharaoh's mistress. Naturally, he is mummified alive, sealed in a coffin with a lot of flesh-eating beetles (the sounds of which make up some of the creepiest stuff in the whole movie), only to be accidentally resurrected by a lot of bounty hunters a few millennia later. This is where the cast comes in, Rick (Brendan Fraser), Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah).Rick is the hero of the movie, the guy who has been there and done it all and just wants to get his money and get out. He's kind of like a cross between the single-mindedness of Han Solo, the bad one-liners of James Bond, and the adventure experience of Indiana Jones, except that he comes across more as a muddy conglomeration of characters like those rather than an original character of his own. He goes through his part upset by the fact that other people seem to be constantly be holding him back from some faraway goal, the importance of which they can probably never be expected to understand. Evelyn is there mainly with scientific interest (until she meets the hottie hero and romance is added to her To Do list) and her brother Jonathan is there for pure financial gain, as is the movie's director and crew and production team. There is also a tagalong character named Beni who I can only satisfactorily describe as a greedy rat, someone you would expect to meet on the wet streets of New York in the 1940s or something. He is a constant double-crosser who never has anyone's but his own best interest in mind, and so naturally ends up working for the resurrected Imhotep.

The rest of the turtles remain the same, new vioces, but the same. What's noticable is that Shredder and Splinter are much more 'Japanese'.This brings me onto Splinter, PURE BRILLIANCE. Perfectly voiced, prefect speeches, perfect music during his speeches, his speeches are my favourite parts of the film; especially the one with Raphael.I also can't stress the importance of how this film doesn't involve digitally created turtles. The turtles look realistic and are properly bought to life by the fact that they properly exist in the world around them. Acting will also always be better with their physical presence, and their relationship with the live action humans is all important. Crucially, it trully allows the turtles to become more 'ninja' than before. It means alot that they went to the trouble of producing decent fight scenes that would have no effect if animated. I'm definitely no fan of CGI use (take Jurrassic Park - I only like the robotic dinosaurs). Another crucial element is that the suits were brilliantly constructed and that the turtles don't look like clones of each other, they're all unique - which may not have happened with CGI.I also love the music in this film. I know that many find the elements such as the music and drama as too much to swallow for a film like this and insist that the film tries to be good however, I find that the value does come from replay, this film can grow on you.I'm not suggesting in any way that this is the perfect film.

This is not a propaganda film that bashes the life of a skinhead.  Being a white supremacist is far from a good thing, and the film doesn't in any way try to condone their lifestyles.  It just serves as a wake-up call that people like these are out there, and rather than treating them as one-dimensional caricatures, the director treats them as regular characters.  I mean, drama involves truth.  If it's an exaggeration of truth, it's called melodrama.  The writer\/director obviously did much research on the lives on these Australian skinheads, and shows in the film that they have feelings, emotions and love lives like the rest of the people in the world.  It may seem sadistic to many having the skinheads as the protagonists in the story, but how many films have we seen where the protagonists are hitmen (Pulp Fiction)?  Or psychopaths (American Psycho)?  Or gangsters (Goodfellas)?  Are we condoning their lifestyles as well?  Does the increased popularity of The Sopranos mean that we all secretly want to be part of the Mafia? *POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD*True, the intentions of these white supremacist groups are anything but pure, but neither are the intentions of Jules and Vincent in PF.  Just because they're the protagonists, doesn't mean we have to feel perfect sympathy for them.  As the director expressed in his commentary, the fact that all the characters died--with the exception of Daniel Pollack's character--is punishment enough for their evil deeds.  There are certainly some disturbing scenes, involving the mass beatings of the new flock of Vietnamese in the community (which disturbed me, being half Asian myself; movies like this mainly focus on the group's hatred for blacks and Jews), but they're not done in a way in which the characters are virtually screaming out, I am evil and ruthless.

I wanted to know more about why he's so ruthless.  Of course, we don't exactly need a heavy-handed flashback sequence, showing how his father brought him up to hate, but I would've appreciated some sort of background.  Pollack's character I was able to understand a lot more.  He's a bit shy and aimless, and I've seen people like him in everyday life.  He doesn't know where to go with his life, has no friends to make him feel welcome, so he joins the first group of people who treat him respect, as if he's a member of the family.  This is why many young people join gangs.  They don't get much affection at home or by most of their peers, so they feel this is the only way to go.  Pollack's subtle performance made the character all the more effective.  It's sad that he died after post production of the film, because he seemed to have great potential.  The director said something interesting in the commentary.  He said that Pollack committed suicide directly after post-production was wrapped.  It's as if he wanted to finish this movie before leaving this world.  Well, God bless his soul.  Russell Crowe does a fine job as well, though I wish I could've seen the film BEFORE he evolved into a massive superstar.  It just makes it more difficult to forget that's Russell on screen.  But he still did a good job.  The woman who plays his girlfriend, who eventually falls into the arms of Pollack, also does a very good job.

But that plan goes wrong, when accidently, Liz chokes on the jawbreaker, her friends stuffed in her mouth to keep her from screaming. Everyone is totally shocked, except the cold hearted Courtney, who just doesn't give a crap about anybody but herself. Julie wants to go to the police right away and tell them what happened but Courtney calms her down and tries to cover the crime and make it look like somebody raped Liz. Suddenly, a geeky outcast named Fern Mayo(Judy Greer) who has always admired Liz, finds out what happened to her and is totally devasted. Courtney tells her if she keeps her mouth shut, she will make Fern something she always wanted to be. POPULAR. This was a very entertaining and fun dark comedy. I enjoyed it a lot. Rose Mcgowan is gorgeous and does a great job along with the rest of the cast. I would give Jawbreaker 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 January 2003","score":"26 out of 36 people found the following review useful","review":"  Courtney(Rose Mcgowan),Julie(Rebecca Gayheart),Marcie(Julie Benz) and Liz(Charlotte Ayanna) were the most popular girls at school.
