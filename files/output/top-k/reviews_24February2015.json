A little boy receives a few unique gifts for his birthday an old cupboard, an old key, and an old Native American Iroquois toy. When combined, something magical happens. The toy becomes a living man. The young boy is at first excited about being able to make his toys come to life, until he learns that with the people being truly alive, it also means they can die. He learns a lot from the Native American about the man's culture, and brings the information to school. But when the boy's friend learns the truth, he decides to bring an old cowboy to life, which causes fights between the toys. This is a heartwarming tale of friendship, love, and the meaning and consequences of life. For that reason, this movie is sweet, and good. However, from a technical standpoint, this movie is terrible. Therefore, I must say, if you have kids then this would be a sweet movie to watch with them. Otherwise, never see this film.Soundtrack 4- There were moments of soundtrack that worked, usually when putting in bits of Native American chants, but for the most part it was just bad.Script 4- There are so many plot holes. Not only that, but the script sounded choppy, and not well thought out. However, there were some moments that seemed to try to be character development, and for the sake of what the script had to offer, it was OK.Originality 10- This was definitely an excellent idea, and might even work if redone better.Cinematography 5- The cinematography was not spectacular. There were some strange camera choices. However, the special effects blended pretty decently, giving this an average score.Casting 2- There were a couple people that worked, but for the most part the cast just wasn't right.Acting 1- The man playing the Native American was decent, and the only reason the acting is not a zero.

Even if there existed a darker side to his jovial laughter, Newman's characters always had a clear sense of who they were. From pool sharks to train robbers to grifters, Newman's characters were always likable, even if they were not always completely comprehensible. Interestingly, Newman was nominated seven times for acting without winning until he snatched the Oscar for The Color of Money, reprising his Academy-nominated role from The Hustler, Fast Eddie Felson. Some Hollywood insiders viewed the win more as recognition for Newman's career than a truly outstanding performance as the other nominees seemed to have offered far more powerful performances. However, some critics regard his performance in The Verdict, for which he was nominated but lost to Ben Kingsley (Gandhi), as quite possibly his best.Newman plays Frank Galvin, a character who is not the typical Newman self-assured role. Galvin is a nearly washed-out civil-suit attorney who is in the twilight of his career. Having once, we learn, been part of a prestigious law firm until he's forced to play fall guy for the firm's scandalous behavior, and is fired, Galvin is a depressed barfly sporting hard drinks and frequent turns at the pinball machine. And he seems lost in a world where he doesn't know where he fits in. His law practice is dismal, and he's resorted to attending post-funeral wakes hoping the family of the deceased might retain him for services provided the death seems wrongful. At one such wake, he's thrown out when he lies to the family, claiming he knew the deceased. He's not just an ambulance chaser, but a hearse chaser in some sense.Mickey Morrissey (Jack Warden), a colleague and former teacher, brings him just the case he's been looking for a young woman who fell into a coma during a failed childbirth at a Roman Catholic hospital in Boston. The family of the comatose victim desires to sue for malpractice. He meets a prestigious anesthesiologist who is willing to support the case, possibly testify at trial. At first Galvin is convinced the hospital and diocese will settle out of court, but then Galvin has a change of heart. He is technically not the attorney of the family members. His client is the comatose victim. He decides to take the case to trial despite a relatively large settlement offered by the Diocese. As a result, the surviving family, the victim's sister and her husband are incensed.A sub-story develops when Frank meets an attractive young woman at the bar he frequents, Laura Fischer, who we learn was once married to an attorney. The story moves on both fronts, in which Frank pursues the case and simultaneously engages in a relationship with Laura. Several stumbling blocks occur in the wake of declining the settlement, including the sudden unavailability of his star witness. Galvin then must pursue other witnesses, some of whom don't wish to testify, while also pursuing another medical expert willing to testify. And then his colleague Mickey stumbles upon something which could put the entire plaintiff's case in jeopardy. The final summation at the conclusion of the trial may be the best courtroom speech of its type since Atticus Finch's summation in To Kill a Mockingbird, as realized by Gregory Peck. The Verdict is an outstanding character-driven story which has as its theme the idea of second chances. As the story unfolds, we learn several characters were compelled onto undesirable paths which were not of their own making, Galvin being the obvious example along with his comatose client. Others are also in similar situations, but more subtly. Larger forces were at work which drove these characters out of their desired situations and into mediocre existences. In this story, there is the possibility for another chance to achieve their desires and reclaim their paths. Some characters succeed while others are denied this second chance at fulfillment and\/or redemption.

Needless to say, it certainly lives up to its reputation as a timeless classic and one with an obvious political agenda, back in the HUAC days. But this is a simple story about revenge and corruption within the unions. It's a very transformative film and it has Marlon Brando at his very best as the man who is afraid to stick up for himself, at least at first. Elia Kazan, whose name might strike a chord with those familiar with history, directed a film about a poor dockworker named Terry who lives his days by caring for his pigeons and working for a corrupt union boss named Johnny Friendly. After he witnessed the murder of a man, he becomes close with the dead man's sister, Edie whom introduces him to Father Barry who tries to convince Terry to snitch on Johnny Friendly. This film has a great cast and they all deliver excellent performances. Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of all time and he has proved that here as Terry, the man with a big heart but a semi-cowardly one. Eva Marie Saint in her film debut has several powerful scenes including a big one with her and Brando trying to speak over the loudness of a ship. Karl Malden as Father Barry is undoubtedly great as the man fighting for a righteous cause and Lee J. Cobb is sinister, but excellent in his role as the crime boss ruling the waterfront streets.

It has hammy performances... that are great! And some of the most atmospheric direction and creative use of limited resources you'll see in any film. On a budget of somewhere between 350 and $400,000, Raimi was able to churn out a film that received praise from Stephen King for being terrifying and went on to gross $2.4 million on its original release. So let's dust off our old VHS, get our box tellies out of the garden shed, dim the lights and take in this horror classic Sam Raimi's Evil Dead.Our story begins with our hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) going with his girlfriend Linda, her sister Cheryl, and another couple Scott and Shelley to stay at a cabin in the woods. These early scenes are a little painful, with Ash failing to gain much interest..or anything.Some typical foreboding things happen on their way to the cabin (a near hit car incident and a semi-collapsing bridge) but they make it the cabin safely. Upon getting there Cheryl's hand is possessed by Satan (or something similar) and she draws a weird picture. Inexplicably finding this normal, she mentions it to no one. Later on at dinner time the attic door in the cabin flings open, Ash and Scott decide to check it out, again because there's nothing abnormal about an attic door flinging itself up for no reason. In the attic they find the Book of the Dead and an old tape player with some incantations on it. Needless to say these incantations release evil and demonic spirits.Cheryl was already demonically possessed earlier and so naturally she is the first to really have horrific things happen to her, like a pretty full on scene where she is violated by a tree. She gets back inside and no one believes her. This is pretty good gradual revelation as the audience and Cheryl know more than the other four characters. Cheryl is understandably hysterical and so Ash tries to drive her back into town, but they realize that the semi collapsed bridge has fully collapsed and they are trapped at the cabin.They arrive back at the cabin and Cheryl turns full zombie. From there they turn one by one until it's just Ash remaining trying to survive the night and survive the zombies.As classical as a horror film plot that is, and I hope from that synopsis of the setup that it comes across just how well this movie builds in the first act, the real star is the awesome shots of the camera zooming through the woods. Now, they couldn't afford dollies on their budget so apparently Raimi tried everything from improvised wooden sliders using trees to getting two guys to run around in the woods holding a camera attached to a wooden rail sleeper. However he did it, Raimi and his virtually novice crew are able to create the sensation of a spirit or force moving through the woods. These shots are unsettling in the first act and downright frightening as the film continues.Another star is the gore effects, even though there are some scenes where you can see blood capsules and melting plastic. In the end, these zombie looking things actually are pretty scary and do work, at least within the world this film happens in.Campbell does grow on you as the film continues and his panicked flailing near the end of the film is excellent. The rest of the cast are inexperienced and do what they're asked by a director who appears to be taking great pleasure in subjecting them to all manner of discomforts and indignities.This film was widely praised when it came out and still highly regarded now. I think I've revealed the most unexpectedly disgusting part, but there's a lot of stuff in here that may offend. With this type of story and budget, you know what to expect, but you can also expect to get a film far better than you typical horror outing. One of the very best the horror genre has to offer.

This action creates extreme outrage locally within the community. Situated in Alexandria, Virginia, racial tensions are already high and desegregation is a fresh idea during this time. Denzel Washington, playing Herman Boone, is assigned the head coaching position at the school. As the team heads off to a two-week camp, hate and disrespect towards the opposite race engulfs the players, making fights amongst them and sloppy plays on the football field a reoccurring issue. However, with the help of the white former head coach, Bill Yoast, and both of their assistant coaches, they are able to gradually put their own differences aside for the name of the game. Through a myriad of strenuous practices, and the even harder task of talking and getting to know one another, positive relationships amongst the players finally begin to develop, bringing the team together both on and off the field. Gerry Bertier, the white captain, and Julius Campnell, the colored captain, serve as a memorable example of true leadership and a blossoming and beautiful friendship. Upon the arrival back home, the town of Alexandria, and more specifically TC Williams High School, appear to be in even more turmoil over the integration. The football team's newfound chemistry and undefeated record eventually set an example for the community and constructively brings them together. No longer black versus white, but the beginning of a 'greyness' that will make history. This movie touches many in its accurate account of a not only upsetting, but also amazing time. ReviewHeartrending. Superb. Eye opening. Brutal. Life changing Remember the Titans never fails to fully amaze its viewers. The effects of this movie are not limited to a select group of people. Reaching from blacks to whites, males to females, children to adults, each and every witness to this film is enlightened and touched by it. Focusing on the football team of the freshly integrated TC Williams High School, this motion picture recounts accurate events of hate and racism, friendship and leadership, as well as success and progress within the local community of Alexandria, Virginia. Racial tensions are at a frightening high in Virginia during the 1970s. When the government mandates that two schools of different races integrate into one high school, the already existing conflicts do the opposite of die down. Currently living in a time and place where discrimination is rarely an issue, it is arduous as a viewer to see the sheer odium that truly prevented people from living a hate-free, just life in this film. For example, the girlfriend of Gerry, one of the main characters and a white player on the team, refuses to shake the colored Julius' hand. A few of the players, Sunshine, a 'gay' Caucasian from California, along with two of his colored teammates, are kicked out of a bar solely because the owner refuses to serve black folks. A divided and unfair society is never a pretty one. The apparent prejudices and subsequent destruction of a community witnessed throughout this movie makes me fully aware and thankful that I live in a significantly changed time. The importance of putting aside differences in color and personality traits is vital to a functioning society as well as a solid team. Although animosity fills the players, true leadership is first seem through the rising captains Julius and Gerry. They come together and realize the team cannot succeed if the white men do not have the black men's backs, and vice versa. The leadership and love for the game these two leaders exhibit critically improves the team dynamics. This cultivates into a strong brotherhood between these two boys especially off the field as well. This friendship is sure to melt the heart of any human. This kind of player and person is the most admirable of traits, one that will always be respected by all. As the boys and coaches form a bond thicker than bone and stronger than steal, their football season remains undefeated. Seemingly the most difficult and impossible task at this time, joining together is thoroughly exemplified through the Titan's efforts on and off the field. Fans and opponents are stunned and some very angry about this. However, the remarkable victory rate seems to bring everyone in the community closer together and farther from their racial differences. Stemming from the TC Williams football team, the progress made between the people of Alexandria in regards to their dissimilarities, is sincerely inspiring and moving. Even just one team of players and coaches working to put prejudices behind them ignited the same goal locally, as well as sparking change in other areas and for the future. Only the most powerful of movies can accurately outline historical events dealing with prejudices and malice, and watch these negatives degenerate into integrated love and respect, and lead to unforgettable accomplishments that start on a football field and lead into an entire community. Heartwarming, enlightening, and overall uplifting, Remember the Titans is a film that requires viewers to open their eyes to the unpleasant reality of prejudices, and teach life lessons that truly leave a mark on one's heart. It is not common to find a movie that truly changes you; that makes you want to be a better person and love and accept everyone. We will all be exposed to tough situations in life. However, this film shows the importance of looking over differences, being the bigger person, knowing your morals and stances on issues and stick to them, and believing that if you work hard enough, you can achieve any goal you make for yourself. Always remember this beautiful story. Remember the vital lessons taught in it. But of course, Remember the Titans.

Only the most powerful of movies can accurately outline historical events dealing with prejudices and malice, and watch these negatives degenerate into integrated love and respect, and lead to unforgettable accomplishments that start on a football field and lead into an entire community. Heartwarming, enlightening, and overall uplifting, Remember the Titans is a film that requires viewers to open their eyes to the unpleasant reality of prejudices, and teach life lessons that truly leave a mark on one's heart. It is not common to find a movie that truly changes you; that makes you want to be a better person and love and accept everyone. We will all be exposed to tough situations in life. However, this film shows the importance of looking over differences, being the bigger person, knowing your morals and stances on issues and stick to them, and believing that if you work hard enough, you can achieve any goal you make for yourself.

This action creates extreme outrage locally within the community. Situated in Alexandria, Virginia, racial tensions are already high and desegregation is a fresh idea during this time. Denzel Washington, playing Herman Boone, is assigned the head coaching position at the school. As the team heads off to a two-week camp, hate and disrespect towards the opposite race engulfs the players, making fights amongst them and sloppy plays on the football field a reoccurring issue. However, with the help of the white former head coach, Bill Yoast, and both of their assistant coaches, they are able to gradually put their own differences aside for the name of the game. Through a myriad of strenuous practices, and the even harder task of talking and getting to know one another, positive relationships amongst the players finally begin to develop, bringing the team together both on and off the field. Gerry Bertier, the white captain, and Julius Campnell, the colored captain, serve as a memorable example of true leadership and a blossoming and beautiful friendship. Upon the arrival back home, the town of Alexandria, and more specifically TC Williams High School, appear to be in even more turmoil over the integration. The football team's newfound chemistry and undefeated record eventually set an example for the community and constructively brings them together. No longer black versus white, but the beginning of a 'greyness' that will make history. This movie touches many in its accurate account of a not only upsetting, but also amazing time. ReviewHeartrending. Superb. Eye opening. Brutal. Life changing Remember the Titans never fails to fully amaze its viewers. The effects of this movie are not limited to a select group of people. Reaching from blacks to whites, males to females, children to adults, each and every witness to this film is enlightened and touched by it. Focusing on the football team of the freshly integrated TC Williams High School, this motion picture recounts accurate events of hate and racism, friendship and leadership, as well as success and progress within the local community of Alexandria, Virginia. Racial tensions are at a frightening high in Virginia during the 1970s. When the government mandates that two schools of different races integrate into one high school, the already existing conflicts do the opposite of die down. Currently living in a time and place where discrimination is rarely an issue, it is arduous as a viewer to see the sheer odium that truly prevented people from living a hate-free, just life in this film. For example, the girlfriend of Gerry, one of the main characters and a white player on the team, refuses to shake the colored Julius' hand. A few of the players, Sunshine, a 'gay' Caucasian from California, along with two of his colored teammates, are kicked out of a bar solely because the owner refuses to serve black folks. A divided and unfair society is never a pretty one. The apparent prejudices and subsequent destruction of a community witnessed throughout this movie makes me fully aware and thankful that I live in a significantly changed time. The importance of putting aside differences in color and personality traits is vital to a functioning society as well as a solid team. Although animosity fills the players, true leadership is first seem through the rising captains Julius and Gerry. They come together and realize the team cannot succeed if the white men do not have the black men's backs, and vice versa. The leadership and love for the game these two leaders exhibit critically improves the team dynamics. This cultivates into a strong brotherhood between these two boys especially off the field as well. This friendship is sure to melt the heart of any human. This kind of player and person is the most admirable of traits, one that will always be respected by all. As the boys and coaches form a bond thicker than bone and stronger than steal, their football season remains undefeated.

The film got Best Picture honors and director Elia Kazan won his second Oscar. Brando got his first nomination in another Kazan film 3 years earlier and this time won. That film was A Streetcar Named Desire and brought Karl Malden the win. Here he got another nomination. Lee J. Cobb shines as the main villain and manages his first Academy award nomination just like Rod Steiger, who has only a very small part and was a complete newcomer to movies at this point. The latter could also be said about Eva Marie Saint with the difference that she did win the prestigious Supporting Actress award for her breakthrough movie. Saint is stunning and gives a truly mesmerizing performance as does Brando. This is maybe my favorite turn from him. Both were in their late 20s in this film and Brando was actually older than Steiger, who played his older brother.Really everybody nails their part here and I am always surprised what a likable presence Karl Malden has. Guess I need to watch Streets of San Francisco at some point. The film is packed with excellent metaphors about all kinds of stuff, including pigeons for example. It deals with (false) loyalty, love, parental disapproval of boyfriends, missed chances and careers and finally having the balls to do the right thing. I am actually glad, the film has a (sort-of) happy ending. Occasionally I felt it could end badly for Brando's character. It's really difficult to find something negative about this film, but maybe if you don't know a lot about unions and the mob in America at this point of time, you may have a hard time to understand crucial moments of the movie, including the ending. That's just a minor criticism though. It's an excellent film and I highly recommend it.

However, a powerful but forgetful wizard named Merlin has plans for Arthur to be something beyond a squire.This movie actually starts off with a captivating intro where England is left without a king, and a proclamation has been sent that the one who can pull the sword out of the stone will be made king. It then leads to imaginative and quirky scenes where Merlin demonstrates his magical powers to Arthur while, at the same time, try to get him an education so he could get to places beyond that of being a squire.This film really does not have much of a plot, as most of the movie is about Merlin showing Arthur his magic spells (I thought the squirrel scene took up too much time). However, it's great imaginative fun for the little kids and, probably to the adults' liking, you can get a couple of important messages from the film like getting an education and how complicated love can get.The animation was pretty good, not as vibrant as earlier films or in later films of the 80s and 90s, but it is serviceable. The songs by the Sherman Brothers weren't my favorite to listen to, but they're quite fun and easy to sing along with (again, something good for the kids). Wolfgang Reitherman did a nice job directing, as the characters were memorable and have a nice dose of humor, and his sons, Richard and Robert, did a nice job in voicing Arthur - innocent and carefree, but grounded. Rickie Sorensen also voiced Arthur and also did an equally good job.Overall, it's not one of the best Disney movies I've seen but it does have a certain charm to it that definitely acquires that special Disney touch.

He plays a highly decorated soldier, who deserted in Cambodia. However, I felt his part was just too self-indulging. It had Give me an Oscar written all over it as the final 45 minutes of the film entirely circled around him and everything before as well as he was talked about for pretty much the entire film. However, Brando did not win a single award anywhere for his performance here and the film won Oscars for its cinematography and sound. With the truly big awards, the Academy preferred a family divorce drama that year. The central character in Apocalypse Now, however, is played by Martin Sheen, who shows striking resemblance to his son Charlie in quite a few scenes.This is probably the most famous anti-war movie of all times. It's in the IMDb top50, but definitely not in my top50. However, I still thought it was a good film. Especially Robert Duvall (Kilgore) succeeds in displaying the insanity of war as he treats combat like a painting, plays classic music to the horrendous scenes and has his guys surfing at the same time. Excellent portrayal. He was the much better Coppola reunion in this movie and the Golden Globe and BAFTA wins were absolutely deserving. And when there is no visual horror...horror (e.g. a severed head or the death of the character played by the very young Laurence Fishburne), we hear people talking about it, for example Kurtz' story on severed children's arms.The redux version of the movie runs for considerably over 3 hours, about 200 minutes, and I would lie if I said there was not a single moment when it dragged. It did, occasionally, for example when they meet the French guys. I could have done without that part. The cast is pretty spectacular. Apart from everybody I already mentioned, there's also Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford and Frederic Forrest in this movie, all 3 Academy award nominees themselves. It's an interesting take on soldiers' lives during this difficult time. But apart from all the brutal battle scenes and (during one scene) the unsuccessful longing for leadership, we also see a bunch of playboy bunnies giving the troops some pleasure with their mere presence.This is a good film, no doubt about it. You may certainly need some knowledge about historical background to fully appreciate it and even then, it is certainly not for everybody, but watching this film can be a great experience. Visually, it's a masterpiece and the cinematography contributes as much to the nightmarish atmosphere and constant fight for survival as does the music, most of all The Doors' This is the End.

It had Give me an Oscar written all over it as the final 45 minutes of the film entirely circled around him and everything before as well as he was talked about for pretty much the entire film. However, Brando did not win a single award anywhere for his performance here and the film won Oscars for its cinematography and sound. With the truly big awards, the Academy preferred a family divorce drama that year. The central character in Apocalypse Now, however, is played by Martin Sheen, who shows striking resemblance to his son Charlie in quite a few scenes.This is probably the most famous anti-war movie of all times. It's in the IMDb top50, but definitely not in my top50. However, I still thought it was a good film. Especially Robert Duvall (Kilgore) succeeds in displaying the insanity of war as he treats combat like a painting, plays classic music to the horrendous scenes and has his guys surfing at the same time. Excellent portrayal. He was the much better Coppola reunion in this movie and the Golden Globe and BAFTA wins were absolutely deserving. And when there is no visual horror...horror (e.g. a severed head or the death of the character played by the very young Laurence Fishburne), we hear people talking about it, for example Kurtz' story on severed children's arms.The redux version of the movie runs for considerably over 3 hours, about 200 minutes, and I would lie if I said there was not a single moment when it dragged. It did, occasionally, for example when they meet the French guys. I could have done without that part. The cast is pretty spectacular. Apart from everybody I already mentioned, there's also Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford and Frederic Forrest in this movie, all 3 Academy award nominees themselves. It's an interesting take on soldiers' lives during this difficult time. But apart from all the brutal battle scenes and (during one scene) the unsuccessful longing for leadership, we also see a bunch of playboy bunnies giving the troops some pleasure with their mere presence.This is a good film, no doubt about it. You may certainly need some knowledge about historical background to fully appreciate it and even then, it is certainly not for everybody, but watching this film can be a great experience. Visually, it's a masterpiece and the cinematography contributes as much to the nightmarish atmosphere and constant fight for survival as does the music, most of all The Doors' This is the End.

Growing up in Australia, I fell under the spell of Doctor Who and could not quite find a cool looking space ship quite as exciting as a magic blue box. I did end up enjoying the Next Generation, though it was never must see TV for me. Star Trek 2 Wrath of Khan did however make me a fan of the film franchise after an underwhelming opening in The Motion Picture.The Wrath of Khan is a grown up story, it fleshes out the character of Khan, brought to life by a well calculated performance from Ricardo Montalban including moments of quiet menace, calm intelligence, sadistic evil and never far from bat sh-t crazy, and his motives far better than any other villain in the series.While the Klingons and Borg are good enemies, Khan works because he is just one man being driven by motives you can believe a man can be driven by, and the power he has at his disposal, combined with his intelligence and lack of restraint, makes him a very dangerous and believable threat indeed.The film continues to develop the dynamic between Kirk, Spock and Bones that is the real driving force behind the film series. Shatner, Nimoy and Kelly are all on form, apart from one infamous moment of unrestrained silliness from Shatner, shouting out KHAAAAN! like he is passing a kidney stone that's inspired many a youtube montage and was even referenced in the later reboot Star Trek into Darkness.Montalban stars as Khan, a super intelligent, super strong humanoid looking war criminal who was left on the moon years earlier by Kirk to give him and the rest of his equally strong and intelligent crew a second chance at life. However, there was no life on the planet and so Khan and his buddies have been living a decidedly second rate existence, with Khan blaming Kirk and becoming increasingly off his rocker over the decades that pass. When Chekov stumbles upon Khan's ship, the evil Mexican hatches a plan to both escape this desolate hell hole and take his revenge on Kirk.Once the script gets Kirk and Khan where it wants them, a chase ensues, and eventually a tactical battle to the death between the two men eventuates with Spock forced to make ultimate sacrifice, the ship's crew blasting his body into space in memoriam at film's end. Kirk and Spock's final goodbye is a scene that can make a grown man weep.Before this though we are introduced to the Kobayashi Maru simulation for the first time (apologies to Trekkies if it was first mentioned in the original television series), a no-win scenario that becomes such a key part of Star Trek lore. We are also introduced to the Genesis project which drives the third film, which is overseen by Kirk's former lover and their son. This is the one that really sets up the rest of the film series. We are also introduced to Lt Saavik, a female Vulcan (Kirstie Alley in her first film role). Moreso than any of the other movies this is so much more than a movie length Star Trek episode. While the first film delivered the box office receipts to show there was a big screen audience for Star Trek, this one delivered the story, the sets and the script to indicate that Star Trek films could actually be not just accessible to a wider audience but could actually be good in their own right. If you only ever watch one of the original Star Trek films, make sure it's this one.
