Like the equally low-budget Carnival of Souls, the film owes much of its effectiveness to the creative use of an available location. The Cement Garden's outdoor shots should look familiar as Stanley Kubrick used the location back in 1987 for the main battle sequence of Full Metal Jacket. He used the abandoned Beckton Gasworks just across from the Royal Docks area (Beckton-Silverton London). The area has now been transformed into London City Airport. As a film, The Cement Garden could best be described as pretentious (marked by an unwarranted claim to importance or distinction). It is a movie that tries embarrassingly hard to be more than the sum of its parts. The strategy is to introduce shocking and scandalous elements in such a casual way that it will amp up the effect of breaking taboos far beyond what they would otherwise merit. This too owes much to Kubrick (insert Lolita here). The Cement Garden is what you would get if Gregg Araki remade Our Mother's House on a shoestring budget; although it is safe to say Araki would have done a much better job of acting for the camera direction. It is an adaptation of Ian McEwan's controversial novel, but as the adapting was done by Director Andrew Birkin (later to be blamed for The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc script), the result is likely to be disappointing to readers of McEwan's book. I recommend the film, although some viewers will not enjoy it most will be mildly shocked and entertained by it. I found viewing possible only in 20 minute segments (not so much because it was painful but because it was not involving enough for me to ignore household interruptions). Since the macabre elements aren't particularly shocking (just a couple of stylish Blue Velvet type shots), Birkin must fall back on incest and gender identity. It is one perversion too many and there is no logical connection between the two. The story is about a family of six (mother, father, two daughters and two sons). The older son is meant to look like a girl, the older daughter is meant to look like a boy, and the younger son wants to be a girl. The mother's death occurs a few weeks after the father, and the children conceal her death in an effort to stay together. The story is told from the point of view of the oldest boy, who is turned on by his own reflection and by his tease of an older sister. Since he looks so much more feminine than her, his sexual orientation may actually be straight. The younger sister (who is not involved in any of this) looks perfectly normal but spends a lot of time writing letters to her dead mother. Like Our Mother's House (a far better film), an older man is inserted into the story in an effort to make something happen. While a little hard to decipher, the basic themes concern the problems associated with assuming responsibilities before you are emotionally mature enough for them. In fairness, an attempt is made to insert an allegorical element into the film, as the older boy frequently does a voice-over reading of a science fiction story. This is meant to reflect his internal moral struggles but the connection with the events of the story is rather fuzzy. Not surprising since the weak direction builds neither suspense nor convincing characters. But at least there is that great production design. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

Of course the parallel with Nikita is because it is the same director, but the story in general is quite similar too! Add to this the little girl characterization of Pretty Baby by Malle.

In Pretty Baby Brooke Shields learned about prostitution and wanted to be a whore, now in Leon Natalie Portman learned about weapons and wanted to be a cleaner. I make the question again... Do these people realize that they are dealing with children, and that somehow this kind of things affect the little actor psyche??? Because of this... I found most time of this movie very disgusting! It was very hard to stay in front on the screen. I like to study English with movies and that is the only reason I kept watching this garbage. I rented this one and well... and had to watch it, at least to learn English.This movie was extremely violent without reason, had many plot holes and impossible things... I mean things no plausible at all.First... I understand the girl had a bad childhood but she wanting to be a killer is not convincing, even with her brother died, an 11 y.o. girl does not have that kind of feelings and wants to murder people.Second, I do not understand why so many people say in their comments that Jean Reno character is a good guy... Do you think a good person would say to a little girl that life is always like this when she ask if it is always so hard??? Even if the life is so hard, you would never paint it in black for a little girl, man!

OK, do it, make the movie, but then do not make a scandal when something like that happens in the real world!I will not continue because this movie made me sick... but wait, somehow the final is good and the plant finale scene is really moving.

Tarantino has that way of charmingly ruffling up other people's work and making it his own and somehow getting us to love it. Jackie Brown is wonderful.This is inarguably Quentin's least appreciated film. This is something like saying the Holy Spirit is not as appreciated as the Father and the Son, because all of his films are appreciated.

He's an eccentric who doesn't realize it, a nearly laughable pseudo-badass-businessman exterior, but with a cold-hearted interior quietly ahead of everyone else, a clever double-sided mastermind.Grier naturally gives off that down-home, unsophisticated streetwise woman-trying-to- make-it feeling in the movie's title heroine, especially early on when we're just coming to know her as a character and she's not saying much, tired from nights spent in jail, just wanting a drink and a smoke and to go home, but knowing something about her situation isn't adding up. We learn to love her not just as a badass black chick in a suit with a gun, but as a middle-aged woman trying to cling to that semblance of a life she has and taking such risks to beat the odds.One surprise in Jackie Brown is the presence of Robert De Niro. It seems appropriate that Tarantino, someone who so embraces the crime genre and having done so much with Harvey Keitel, should cast De Niro as a seasoned career scumbag, the staple of his tremendous career. The surprise is that he plays the character down, which is so rare for him to do. Usually, De Niro takes a character and plays him up, making him a bigger, tougher, more brazen and bombastic character, sometimes just a little bit and sometimes a lot. Jackie Brown is a departure from the majority of his other work. His character shares a lot of the same traits as most of De Niro's other tough guys and crooks, but his disposition is so different.

Elder daughter Charlie is over the moon when they are paid a surprise visit by her namesake, Uncle Charlie, who brings gifts and excitement, but also a shady and uncomfortable past ...I like this movie, but it's not my favourite Hitchcock film by a rather long chalk. It's extremely well made and the cast are great but whenever I see it, it feels a little flat to me and I'm never quite sure exactly what tone it's going for. The depiction of the small town (it was shot in the real Santa Rosa) and the corruption of young Charlie's innocence are terrific - she starts out bored by the humdrum predictability of her family but by the end she would give anything just to have that back. But as a thriller it has (perhaps intentionally) almost no suspense; we know that Uncle Charlie is a vicious, self-interested sociopath right from the start and we never have any sympathy for him. Wright - the Jodie Foster of her generation - is superb as the girl becoming a woman, forced into facing harsh truths, Collinge is memorable as the self-sacrificing mother who gives all to her family but underneath is dangerously fragile, and there are several excellent vignette performances, notably Cronyn as the meek neighbour. The most interesting thing about Shadow Of A Doubt is that Hitchcock cited it as his favourite of his own films, a comment that intrigues me when he made many other films that were more successful, more ambitious, more original, scarier, funnier, more exciting - take your pick. I think perhaps he meant that from first conception to final cut, this film turned out exactly the way he wanted it to, with nothing lost in the process, more than any other movie he made. It certainly doesn't have any flaws; for me, it's just a bit too much like Santa Rosa - ordinary and respectable. Scripted by Thornton Wilder (the author of Our Town), Sally Benson and Alma Reville (Hitch's wife); catch the director's cameo as the unlucky card-player on the train.

If you think about it as you watch it, it's very interesting. Of course, many people at the time had probably only heard the names of the actors in the film for the first time, with the exception of James Caan, so it may not have been a star attractor. Maybe that explains it? All I know is that I wanted to watch this again after the first view because it was that good.Dignan, played by Owen Wilson, is now a film icon for me. His name is not only the coolest name ever, but it alone spells out his dignity, passion, and aggressive will to hang on whatever he can get. Even though Anthony (Luke Wilson) makes a good main character, the film focuses on Dignan, for his actions motivate the other characters and keep the film going. Wilson's performance of this character was probably at his best and it is one of those very rare acts where the actor doesn't become the character, but actually is the character.As I said, it is the simplest complex films I've ever watched because the scenes are rather mellow and easy, not emotional and touching like most friendship comedy-drama films, but they still leave the audience with feelings. That's why the script is brilliant. It spares intensity from the screen and lets the audience find it for each person itself. It's very hard to achieve that, but Wes Anderson and Wilson do so.Each character is so well formed. Like Anderson's other movie, The Royal Tenenbaums, you can see the essence of each character just from their appearance, voice, and movement. Only for this one, I cannot quite describe how. The only way to know what I'm talking about is to actually see these characters for yourself.Almost like a Shakespearean play, every character shown plays a role. Even those who seem minor have an important part, so their appearances aren't wasted. An example is Grace (Shea Fowler), Anthony's caring but cynical kid sister who is deeply disappointed at her brother's chosen destination in life. At first, Anthony's happy to see her, to see that someone understands and knows him like the person he really is. But he sees that, over time, Grace has become unlike that, that her childish deceit has come in the way. She becomes a hard spot in Anthony's life and mind, which becomes resolved for a time by Inez (Lumi Cavalos).This may be a mere cult hit now, but I have a feeling that it will become something bigger in the future.

I admit the first time I saw it I thought it was just about the weirdest, nonsensical film I ever saw, but now, every time I'm in the mood to hear some mellowing Simon and Garfunkel music, it never disappoints. It's a great movie to put on when you feel like thinking and when you don't feel like thinking. The characters, despite their problems, are relatable and sympathetic. The direction is powerful, especially for the time. The soundtrack is perfect on so many levels. And, I have to admit as a sucker for happy endings, it has probably one of the greatest, most realistic last couple of shots in a movie. Dustin Hoffman plays Benjamin Braddock, a college graduate who comes home to his comfortable, lazy lifestyle after overachieving for four years. He feels pressure from his parents and their well-to-do friends, and at his overwhelming graduation party, he runs into Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson, a bored housewife, the wife of Ben's father's business partner. She gets him back to her house and tells him that if he ever wants to sleep with her, he should feel completely free to. Ben objects, but when his confusion about his future overruns his mangled good judgment, he takes up her offer and they continue to see each other for several months, a secret that they conceal quite perfectly. Things start to go sour when Mrs. Robinson's daughter (played by Katharine Ross) is thrown into the mix. Ben takes her on a purposely awful date to appease his parents, but then he discovers that in a time of vagueness and boredom, Elaine Robinson is the only person who really understands him. Once he falls in love, everything unravels. Everything about this movie is symbolic and cyclical (the beginning and end seem to be parallel, for instance, with the somehow appropriate S&G tune 'The Sound of Silence' playing hauntingly in both scenes, depicting how Ben is just as alone and confused in the end of the film as he was in the beginning). All of the actors are perfect in their roles, stirring sympathy at parts and disdain at others (Bancroft, for example, exudes such vulnerability during her a scene with Hoffman when he insists that they talk before they leap into bed together that one cannot help but feel for the seductive, married woman). The music ties it all together, so calming and even eerie that the songs come out like thoughts of the characters, which I believe is how they were intended to be presented. A final thought as a teenager brought up on the movies of this day and age, I applaud Mike Nichols for this old breath of fresh air. Bravo.

Congress proposed a bill that would hike the minimum wage for the first time in almost ten years. (Meanwhile, Congress had voted itself almost ten raises in the same period.) Enemies of the minimum wage hike tacked on a repeal of the estate tax for the mega-wealthy, so the bill flunked.I just give that as an example of how some things worked during this past year, a period in which Congress worked for 93 days. (They gave themselves two weeks off for St. Patty's day alone.) Anyone who follows the news knows as much as I've just written, and in fact I may have added some misleading details out of ignorance.How can such things happen? If a bill is designed to raise the minimum wage, period, how can an explosive device like a repeal of the estate tax be buried in it? How, exactly, does a bill get hung up in committee? WHAT committee, and why? And how come the House Ways and Means Committee is always described in the press as powerful? What makes it so damned powerful? All these kinds of issues are raised and answered in a five-minute lecture given by Saunders (Jean Arthur) to Honorary Senator Jeff Smith (Jimmy Stewart). It's not really as complicated as it sounds. I learned more from Saunders' little explanation than I did during months of civics in the fifth grade. So much for your class, Mrs. Greene. You never liked me anyway, and to tell you the truth I always found you a little overbearing.

The villains are really villainous -- except for Claude Raines, the bad guy who turns good. The issue in this case is hardly one involving life and death. It's not about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or abortion or capital punishment. It's about a kind of Boy Scout camp that Stewart wants to build on some unused acres in his home state, land that will be paid for by the Boy Scouts themselves by sending in their nickels and dimes. (No more than ten cents apiece, says Stewart.) As in many of Capra's populist and popular entertainments there are shady shenanigans going on behind all the public nobility displayed. A bad guy (Edward Arnold) intends to build a lucrative dam on that land and discredits Stewart, who is humiliated and scorned by his former admirers. The format is familiar and undemanding.And of course no one in Washington is as naive as Stewart. The Boy Scouts? Dimes? Are you kidding?

If A Soldier's Story had kept itself to this level, it probably would have done better at the box office, been considered more daring and controversial and been talked about as a landmark film. It also probably would have been trendy, clichéd, one dimensional, and, of course, at least partially false. If you don't see something in its entirety, it's very easy to misunderstand it. For centuries people looked at the land around them and concluded the world was flat. A clear example of how the vast majority sees something that is irrefutable, yet in reality it is a lowest common denominator myth based in ignorance. A Soldier's Story is a much better film than to rely on such one or even two dimensional near-sightedness. The story and characters are motivated by life-like emotions and thoughts, so it is honest, meaningful and, not surprisingly, overlooked as one of the finest films to cover the subject of racism.It would be very convenient, and the solution for racism would be very easy, if all the blame for it could be attributed to a specific group of people from a specific area of a country; in this case the opening quote above refers to the whites who lived in and mostly controlled the southern United States during the 1940s. If the white people in the south were the entire cause of racism for black Americans then jailing, executing or somehow making them stop their terrible practices would be the simple solution for the blacks to live happily ever after. But real adults know happily ever after only exists as a sweet, neat and tidy way to finish children's stories. Sometimes, however, even real adults can forget that the causes and therefore the solution to racism is not as simple, neat and convenient as we like to think and tell each other during our semi-thoughtful moods. For a start, like so many other undesirable things in societies and life, racism is so pervasive and entrenched that it becomes invisible even though it is constantly in our field of vision. A good example is when one of the black soldiers said Sir, they lynched Jefferson the week I got here and two weeks after that- and he doesn't finish the statement as he is interrupted by his C.O. The subject of his sentence, a previous racial murder, is dismissed as irrelevant to the current murder of that day. It is used as a throw away line, something the characters and most of the audience quickly dismiss, for a variety of reasons, but mostly because underlying its dismissal is Yeah, they lynched blacks back then with a regular frequency and your point is...? Just as tragically, the attitude with which the character delivering the line is somewhat dismissive, or more correctly, defeatist, as in Yeah, and what can we do about it? We're the ones being lynched and we ain't got the power. Just another one of us murdered. All of this is conveyed effectively by its brevity and casualness, just as it, sadly, is in real life. Not even a sub-plot, just a minor bit of story and character foundation, a throw-away line. That's the nature of something that is pervasive and entrenched, the majority believing the half truths or outright lies used to justify the actions more than the actions themselves; and the majority must be complicit in pervasive, institutional racism or it would not exist. Another thing real adults know is that black and white, in the human world, are concepts, ideas, there are no men who are all black, just as there are no men that are all white. Most men (and women) are gray, varying shades of black and white, just as probably no men are all good or all evil. And in and among these shades of gray is self-loathing and all types of racism, including racism with members of your own race. I think Groucho Marx was speaking for the common man when he said I would not want to belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member. There is a great deal of detail in the many trees within this film but it is easy to miss much of it, partially because you're involved with the story (forest) and also because the subject is painful, pervasive and ignored as much as possible, even in the relatively safe confines of a movie. A really excellent film, like any form of art, will make you be more aware of reality, something we constantly obscure with our personal and social delusions. Another reason the depth of this movie can be missed is the presentation of the story. It is presented like a Hollywood film, in a formulaic-style package, which betrays the content. The presentation is a little slick but the subject, story and details are not, which is written by Charles Fuller, who also did the original play for which he won a deserved Pulitzer Prize. Not to disparage Norman Jewison at all, a man who has directed a number of great masterpieces, including the masterfully presented In the Heat of the Night, which did not share quite the same intricate details of racism as this offering does. Perhaps this is just an example of how as wonderful as the movie medium can occasionally be it may lack in intellectual presentation when compared to the play or novel. Regardless, for what it offers, including outstanding performances all around, including the late but greats Adolph Caesar, Larry Riley, and, of course, Howard E. Rollins Jr., it doesn't get much better than A Soldier's Story, a movie I recommend for multiple viewings to afford yourself the opportunity to see the pervasive racism within your world and self a little more clearly.

After finding a few leads, he has an encounter with a dangerous cannibal tribe called The Fierce Ones and actually stumbles on his son as he tries to flee for his life. The dilemma of the piece comes with a decision left up to Tommy, leave his tribe which are essentially his real family after ten years of living with them or joining his father in the modern civilization across the river.The film is more a focus on how modernization, progress if you will, has began to wipe out the trees and land of Amazon tribes as they slowly die out. Interesting enough is that Bill is a model example of this type of progress as he heads a log dam which clears land once civilized by The Fierce Ones tribe. He will spend time with The Invisible Ones tribe and find the error of his ways seeing that what he and others(White Man)are doing to people who have lived here for centuries destroying cultures. We also see how the ugliness of prostitution has became a stigma to tribes as The Fierce Ones trade women from The Invisible Ones tribe for machine guns. Using the machine guns, The Fierced Ones have a clear advantage over The Invisible Ones and their mere spears. Again, through that we see how progress can also destroy a civilization..The Fierce Ones can wipe out who they deem a threat and\/or nuisance with advanced weaponry.When The Invisible Ones lose a great deal of their men to those machine gun attacks, Tomme(his name amongst his tribe)will search for his father across the river for help to get back their women who have been traded to a prostitution house.Stunning cinematography(by Philippe Rousselot)and score are highlights of this amazingly shot film set in the Amazon. Through Boorman's fluid camera-work, we follow the characters as they travel to destinations in the immense forest, yet see what is happening as modernization is chopping away the trees that once populated said Amazon forest. I thought the angle of the modern age clashing with tribal customs in the form of Tommy to be the strong point of the film while the progress part of the film as it pertains to the cultures being wiped out laid on a bit too thick. I didn't quite like the remaining twenty minutes(the deal with the prostitution ring resulting in heavy violence and the whole rain ordeal as it destroys the dam) as much as the first hour as Powers Booth's Bill was amongst a culture of people he knew nothing about. Seeing his son almost completely tribal is interesting not to mention the viewer getting a glimpse into a unique culture of people and their ways of living. The mythological aspects were also diverting from the realism of the film(if a wee bit silly).Young Charley Boorman is quite impressive as Tomme.

Again, through that we see how progress can also destroy a civilization..The Fierce Ones can wipe out who they deem a threat and\/or nuisance with advanced weaponry.When The Invisible Ones lose a great deal of their men to those machine gun attacks, Tomme(his name amongst his tribe)will search for his father across the river for help to get back their women who have been traded to a prostitution house.Stunning cinematography(by Philippe Rousselot)and score are highlights of this amazingly shot film set in the Amazon. Through Boorman's fluid camera-work, we follow the characters as they travel to destinations in the immense forest, yet see what is happening as modernization is chopping away the trees that once populated said Amazon forest. I thought the angle of the modern age clashing with tribal customs in the form of Tommy to be the strong point of the film while the progress part of the film as it pertains to the cultures being wiped out laid on a bit too thick. I didn't quite like the remaining twenty minutes(the deal with the prostitution ring resulting in heavy violence and the whole rain ordeal as it destroys the dam) as much as the first hour as Powers Booth's Bill was amongst a culture of people he knew nothing about. Seeing his son almost completely tribal is interesting not to mention the viewer getting a glimpse into a unique culture of people and their ways of living. The mythological aspects were also diverting from the realism of the film(if a wee bit silly).Young Charley Boorman is quite impressive as Tomme.

After finding a few leads, he has an encounter with a dangerous cannibal tribe called The Fierce Ones and actually stumbles on his son as he tries to flee for his life. The dilemma of the piece comes with a decision left up to Tommy, leave his tribe which are essentially his real family after ten years of living with them or joining his father in the modern civilization across the river.The film is more a focus on how modernization, progress if you will, has began to wipe out the trees and land of Amazon tribes as they slowly die out. Interesting enough is that Bill is a model example of this type of progress as he heads a log dam which clears land once civilized by The Fierce Ones tribe. He will spend time with The Invisible Ones tribe and find the error of his ways seeing that what he and others(White Man)are doing to people who have lived here for centuries destroying cultures.

Most of the Marches are too old for their roles, which is a bit distracting. (I still cringe a bit at the thought of Marmee kissing a 25-year-old Hepburn good night and tucking her into bed...shudder.) However, the movie picks up quickly enough, and is generally fun and enjoyable, if a bit sugary. Hepburn makes an adorable Jo, although she, too, is quite over-the-top in the early scenes with the other Marches. Those scenes still makes for little guilty pleasures, such as the scene where Jo directs Amy for a fainting scene in her Christmas play (You have to get into the mood!) and the scene where Jo plays a mustached villain in said Christmas play.I would say that Hepburn's real turning point in this movie is after Jo rejects Laurie's proposal and decides to move to New York. From that point on, Hepburn's gradually develops Jo's character from an brashy wild child to a mature and strong woman -- who doesn't have to sacrifice too much of her personality.I recommend this as a good, clean family film - just try not to roll your eyes too much in the early scenes and you'll be fine.
