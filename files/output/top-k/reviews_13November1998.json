Gillian Armstrong does an amazing job.  Everything is so detailed and bright and colorful.  There are wonderful moments when the camera does a close-up shot of a pair of hands shaking sugar powder over a cake ... or of red rose petals being spread over a row of worn dolls.  These are very little, but memorable moments.I've read the Little Women series several times - before and after seeing this movie.  I've also seen two other film versions; this one is really a superb adaptation of Little Women and Good Wives.  It's also modernized (and pretty much de-Christianized) but in keeping with the original sentiment of the novels.This is one of those movies that I watch and ... as the minutes pass I dread arriving at the conclusion.  I just want it to go on and on.Kirsten Dunst, Susan Sarandon and Christian Bale are really the stand outs in this picture.  Christian Bale is the absolute best Laurie imaginable. His proposal scene to Jo (I'll let you win every argument) is great.  Kirsten Dunst is perfect as the spoiled, self-absorbed (but still sweet and lovable) youngest March sister. Every time I see this movie I want Susan Sarandon to be MY mother.  She is just like Marmee in the book.Winona Ryder as Jo is, of course, the central character - and she plays her well, but I found it a little hard to accept her because she is nothing like the Jo in the book.  I mean, Jo wasn't really supposed to be so pretty and petite as Winona Ryder.  One of the reasons Jo is such an enduring and beloved character is the very fact that she WAS an ordinary-looking girl - but she had an extraordinary spirit.  Thousands upon thousands of girls could relate to her.By casting Winona Ryder it felt silly to hear her say things like I'm ugly.  If she was supposed to be ugly, what about the rest of us?  Well, in any case, I can forgive that because Ryder really does do a good job and the rest of the casting (except for the somewhat distant Samantha Mathis) was right-on.All in all, the movie is great family entertainment. It's a nice portrayal of old-fashioned feminism, and the bonds of family (especially sisterhood). Maybe it won't strike such a strong chord with the male sector but I haven't met a woman yet who didn't love it.

A praise based on a middle-of-the-night viewing of this movie on TV about ten years ago that stuck in my memory. I was a teenager then, and a lover of classic films. What I remembered was a great film based on the Scopes monkey trial, starring two great actors who became their characters right there in front of us. The way I remembered it, for a few minutes, Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryant were alive again through Spencer Tracy and Fredric March. Now, all those years have passed and I've become more acquainted with the Scopes monkey trial, and I must say that, having rewatched the movie yesterday, Inherit the Wind leaves a lot to be desired in terms of accuracy. The film is definitely biased towards the evolutionists and paints an unrealistic picture of the events. About the only aspect of this movie which can be taken as factual is the trial itself. Jerome Lawrence, the playwright whose play served as a base for this adaptation, didn't have a lot of hard work putting this together. He took almost verbatim, word-by-word, the sparring between Clarence Darrow and William J. Bryant and gave his characters their lines. One could say that Lawrence didn't really write the best lines in the play, but Darrow and Bryant (here named Henry Drummond and Mathew H. Brady)did, in real life. What Lawrence did create was a lot of composite, bigoted, biased secondary characters who don't seem to do more than slow the plot down. Nevertheless, the clash of the stars is a once in a lifetime spectacle almost as interesting as the Scopes trial itself. The cast is in top shape, with March an incredible Brady and Spencer Tracy no less than mesmerising. I suggest it as a double-feature with Compulsion (1959), starring Orson Welles in the Spencer Tracy role, an also ABSOLUTELY brilliant acting showcase! They don't make lawyers like Darrow anymore!
