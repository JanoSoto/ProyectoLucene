I wouldn't say this is the best movie I ever saw, but it's up there with the greatest.

Problem is the driving force of the series gets killed at the end of it. What do Fox do? Do they hope they can carry on without her? Do they pretend it was all a dream and hope no-one notices? Do they take the side route of pairing the Aliens off with the Predators? Nope, they do their damnedest to get Ripley back on her feet. In this the film succeeds. As for the rest my opinions are somewhat divided.As a standalone film about a different alien species AR would probably have succeeded. The nice, slow, tense build-up was used brilliantly. The Alien escape is very clever. And the underwater sequence borders on genius. It's a good little sci-fi horror which is incredibly stylish and has some clever twists to it.Unfortunately AR is not a standalone film. It's part of one of the most successful and influential franchises ever made. As such it has to be compared to the others. This is where it falls down. AR never escapes the feeling that it's merely a bridge for the next one. Somewhere, I believe, is a truly awe-inspiring Alien script. It's the best of the series, will win awards by the shedload and become a legend in film history. But it's got Ripley in it. Fox scramble to get Ripley back into the series which results in this a film which just doesn't match up to (or use) the Alien heritage.The idea of introducing a human element to the Alien world is a nice one. It's also clever to parallel it by introducing an Alien element into the human world with the hybrid Ripley. But by doing this the Aliens lose something. The mystique is gone. They're no longer the most ruthless killers in known space. They no longer kill because it's in their nature to do so. They loose that level of terror which they always had. It gets replaced with the Newborn. This unholy union of chimpanzee and strawberry blamanche will either have you gasping at it's horrifying elegance or make you splutter into your popcorn. Guess which one I did.The whole film is a rehash of the previous three. We get Scott's shadowy corridors and silent terror. We get Camerons gung-ho action and horror in numbers. We get Finchers dark visuals and gothic sets. We don't get anything new except ideas which don't work or aren't used properly. In the first film the computer was called Mother. Now it's called Father. Go figure. There's also a casting problem. Hedaya and Dourif ham it up because they know they're only minor. Perlman mugs away trying to look hard but only succeeds in looking stupid. Ryder looks out of place and never quite gets her swearing right. But worst is the criminal underuse of Wincott. Add a lousy, tacked on ending and the case for the prosecution is complete.One of the aspects of the Alien series which I've always liked is the fact that each film has a different director. This means that each film has a different visual style. I expect they'll do it again for Alien 5. Now it's absolutely essential! Get Jeunet as far away from from the film set as possible! His surreal, Lynch-like style may work for Delicatessen. Here it's just plain weird and he never seems to be taking it seriously. Hopefully the next film will have a lot less brown and a lot less goo.This isn't a bad film (it has a strangely watchable quality) but it's a half hearted attempt which only served one purpose getting Ripley back.

Dark Crystal is like a cult favorite to me since the first time I watched it when I was a kid and should be recommended to watch if people who want to see a wierd fantastic Muppet movie and this movie is made from England like the other Muppet movies that the Jim Henson Workshop did.  Anyway this movie rules and the Muppets!

In fact, from reading some of the other reviews here, it may be the only way to enjoy this movie.A great read; a better-than-I-expected screen adaptation.  I had to see it, because I couldn't imagine how such a character-driven work would be handled on film.  I will tell you that I was predisposed to think that it would not be handled well, but I was pleasantly surprised.All in all, this movie manages to do a good job of condensing the book into a non-butt-busting film length, while remaining generally faithful to it. The length and the slowness of the movie are really the only ways to convey the meanderings of the book. It's part of the way this movie creates the slow Southern atmosphere that is such an integral part of the story. Savannah is a character in the book, and the only unifying force other than the author.  It's easier to convey that in words than pictures, but Eastwood has done a good job of getting the point across here.The casting is mostly great, particularly the supporting characters.  Irma P.

I didn't know how the casting of the actual Chablis would affect the film, but she really delivers the goods without seeming like stunt casting.I was irritated by what I felt were John's and Chablis' too-active roles in the court case, but I suppose I can understand the reasoning behind it.  I don't have to like it, but I understand it.  Just as irritating, and entirely disposable, was the romantic subplot.

I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the film loves all of its characters, no matter how depraved they may act.  Then it leads us, as the audience, to care about the characters, even though we want them brought to justice.  The film never gets very explicit about its cannibalism overtones, or what has caused the shortage of livestock that has driven some people to eat any meat they can possibly get. No, they're not flesh-eating zombies, they're regular people with jobs and families, and when Louison tells Julie what happened to Livingston, his chimpanzee performing partner, we see this seedy apartment is merely a microcosm for the rest of the world.  Not everyone is so insistent on eating meat, and that's what differentiates the main characters and the Troglos, underground dwelling vegetarians, or seed-eating faggots as Clapet calls them, probably inaccurately.  Even so, even Clapet manages to gain our sympathy so that we laugh as much as we cry when he gets his comeuppance.Never have I seen a romantic comedy this thought-provoking, a science fiction film so caring, a horror film so pleasant.  The comic bumbling suicide victim is sadly tragic, sweet and loveable, and oh dear what happened to Grandma and the guy who'll disguise himself as garbage to escape.  The monsters are humans, the humans victims, the victims monsters. This is surely one of the greatest films ever made, defying genre categorization, doing so much in such a visionary way without ever sinking into luridness (unless one counts the stage business with Marcel clening his prophilactic, but even that is important since no one, anywhere, can afford another mouth to feed, because it's likely to have Swiftian consequenses). Highly recommended, even if you think it's not your taste.

I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the film loves all of its characters, no matter how depraved they may act.

The film never gets very explicit about its cannibalism overtones, or what has caused the shortage of livestock that has driven some people to eat any meat they can possibly get. No, they're not flesh-eating zombies, they're regular people with jobs and families, and when Louison tells Julie what happened to Livingston, his chimpanzee performing partner, we see this seedy apartment is merely a microcosm for the rest of the world.  Not everyone is so insistent on eating meat, and that's what differentiates the main characters and the Troglos, underground dwelling vegetarians, or seed-eating faggots as Clapet calls them, probably inaccurately.

The movie is a take on the valley girl lifestyle of the 80's-early 90's (yes, like Clueless), Kristy Swanson suits the role to a T, and the appearance by Pee-Wee Herman is a blast. Personally, I think the TV series is good in its own right. But it's unfair and crazy that people compare the film and the show with such scrutiny. It's like comparing apples and oranges. The movie was a comedy with a little drama, and the series is a drama with a little comedy. The TV series would have been better off with a different title, because except for a few vague similarities, they are NOTHING alike. There isn't even one similar character between the two. So for those of you who like the series but have never seen the movie, don't expect to see Angel, Giles, Xander, or Drusilla. It's not that kinda movie.

This is without a doubt the best film I have ever seen. Judd Nelson's portrayal of John Bender is truly sexy. Oh, how I wish I was Molly Ringwald. It's a shame that the cast have fallen into the traps of American sitcoms and T.V. movies. However the film would probably not have the same impact on the teenage population, today. Saying this, I first saw this film in the mid 90's as a young teenager and have loved it ever since. Although the film is set in one place for most of the film, the script and the chemistry between the actors more than make up for it. In conclusion, I would say that The Breakfast Club is explosive viewing, so ENJOY.

I haven't liked all of Drew Barrymore's movies that much and was scared this would be very boring. I was wrong. The movie is beautiful to look at and the score was amazing. Andy Tennant did a great job of directing this picture. The acting was well done all around. I liked the bickering in the bittersweet relationship of the King and Queen, and I loved the idea of only one bad step-sister. Drew Barrymore held this picture together and she certainly deserves credit for that alone. The film is about true love, some will think it a very goofy fairy tale.
