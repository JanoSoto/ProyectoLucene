He's among a quartet of old flyboys given their one shot in space 40 years after being bypassed by NASA. It's a film that deploys charm in place of a smart script.I can't fill up a spaceship with geriatrics, moans a nasty NASA executive played by James Cromwell with a shaky Southern accent.Clock's ticking, Bob, and I'm only getting older, Eastwood's Frank Corvin replies.Eastwood is a good sport in playing up his age for laughs, as are Donald Sutherland, James Garner, and Tommy Lee Jones. Jones looks a bit young for active service in the 1950s, as does Cromwell as their former commander. A bigger problem is the way the film plays to action-comedy convention most of the way through before pulling a big tearjerker of an ending that doesn't make much sense.Not that much was making sense before. At the beginning, for example, we see the then-young quartet (younger actors badly dubbed by the four croaky stars) go through a bone-rattling mission, only to discover upon landing that weaselly Bob has grounded them for space flight in favor of a chimp. Why does he have them appear at a press conference to be humiliated, or even allow them to go up one last time knowing their Project Daedalus has been scrubbed? Eastwood and his writers go for the big scenes, and don't worry about setting them up properly.All this opening section does is waste time that could have been economically handled with a minimum of exposition. We don't even need the protracted scenes of the four meeting up again, especially when we are asked to believe Frank doesn't know that his old buddy Hawk (Jones) has lost his wife years before, or that the woman Jerry O'Neill (Sutherland) is hanging out with isn't his daughter.The age jokes get annoying, too. You noticed how everybody seems to be dead lately? asks Tank Sullivan (Garner).Garner is supercargo on this mission, regulated to making lame Holy-Joe jokes about his vocation as a minister. The man has obvious difficulty walking (Garner had major knee surgery years before) but we are asked to believe he can pass an astronaut physical.I wasn't buying, but as a trip to the well it works in bits and pieces. Sutherland has fun playing his Ensure-gulping Lothario character, in one scene memorably pulling out his teeth as Frank grimaces in disgust. They work off each other as well as they did in Kelly's Heroes 30 years before. I liked Jones best in two scenes he shares with Marcia Gay Harden, a love interest who still can't make him forget his wife - or his willingness to give of himself in service of his fellows.Like many Eastwood films, Space Cowboys pushes bad guys into the picture with no subtlety. Cromwell's constant glowering is bad enough. Worse is Loren Dean as a seemingly smart astronaut whose left-field hatred for Frank causes an outer-space meltdown as severe as HAL 9000's in 2001. You're only here as a publicity stunt, he whines, Eastwood's way of letting us know it's okay to dislike him.As a director, Eastwood isn't subtle but usually he's more economical. Space Cowboys, which runs over two hours, is the kind of movie that leaves you with the concept and little else. With a cast like that, you just want for something more than a spacewalk into the sunset.

Also, I want to say how fall short this falls of the other two, and tales from the darkside.The first thing I would like to talk about is how weak the back story is. If you do not know the details, it's a retarded cannibal wants to fry a kid for a dinner party. And the kid is delaying her by telling stories from a book, Tales From The Darker Side.The first story is called Crate 247 or something ridiculous like that. It revolves around a wanna be porn star who's making a fetish about west Colombia or something, a Christopher Walken wanna be and two annoying rich assholes. Chris Walken raises a mummy and the other people are the ones to pay. I enjoyed the mummy effects, and the kills were cool. The climax was okay. And the acting and music were decent. This gets a 7.1 out of 10.The second story is about a cenile old man who calls and assassin or something to kill a retarded cat. As flashbacks play, we see two weed addicts get killed in ridiculous ways and a man spazz out and die when he gets scratched. So the villain of our story, the slasher, not Jason, Freddy or even Chucky, is being hunted by a retarded guy who can't fight him with guns, tranquilizers and knives even though he's a cat. I was sad when I saw how much Steven King ruined himself with this story. The plot was terrible.The acting was pretty bad,except for the main character, who did a good job and even made me laugh at times.The effects were goofy and cheesy, all around unlikeable. However, there is some amazing suspense and tension. The music is pretty good. I rate this with a 3 of 10 because of the story and supporting cast. Otherwise it would be an easy 6.The gargoyle episode, Lover's Vow was not a bad watch, with some nasty effects and great gore. It centers around an artist named Preston who sees something very unusual occur. After promising not to tell anyone what he saw for his life, he meets a girl. He is generous to her, and they end up falling in love and having children. The reason this works is because the actor for Preston does an amazing job at how he wants to tell somebody and the paranoia of what if he does . And how much the night changed him. He secretly makes artwork of gargoyles, but nobody knows about it because he's afraid he may end up spilling the real information of the night to whoever finds the art. There is a quality to this one that is chillingly human, which makes this so eerie. I don't think I should reveal anything besides this, because you should see it for yourself. You will most likely love the twist!!The story gets a 7 out of 10. The acting gets a 7, because most of the supporting cast sucks. The flawless effects get a 10. The music is amazing, getting a 9.6. So my final score for this one? 8.8 out of 10.And how does the back story end? Watch it yourself and find out. It kinda sucks. On my scale, it gets a 2.5 out of 10.My final words- it really has some strong points which can almost save it, but sadly the weak points are overwhelming. If you liked the other two, and Tales from the Darkside, then pick it up if you are curious... Otherwise stick to the superior Twilight Zone the movie for this kind of short story thing.

I've seen a few of the films he's written and, yeah, they tend to be very good. I barely remember Heistbut vaguely recall that it seemed to go nowhere pretty quickly; I'm sure I enjoyed it to at least some extent merely as a result of the presence of Gene Hackman, one of those actors who elevates anything he's in solely by virtue of his presence. Unfortunately, Mr Hackman wasn't in The Spanish Prisoner, though I think the main problem here is that a real director wasn't directing the thing.Early on in the piece I was trying to reconcile what I've always heard Mamet was noted for -- realistic dialog -- with the garbage I was hearing the actors on screen parrot. 'Parrot' being, given Mamet's way of working with actors (well, 'dictating to' is probably more correct), definitely the word. Part of the problem was quoting ancient Phoenician poets or whatever the hell much of the early dialog consisted of, a trait absent in 99% of the world's relatively sane population and less convincing when the direction comes from a man who seems (understandable, from a writer's perspective, as it may be) a total control freak when it comes to actors delivering his dialog. The fact that Ricky Jay (who, though a cool dude, is a very obviously limited and self-conscious 'actor') delivers some of these lines probably has less to do with their failure than Mamet's helming the affair.I mean, I've spent my fair share of time in some quite diverse subcultures and seen a fair bit of the world, spending a great many years in academia and the like as well as, in common with probably most Americans, in the middle of crowds of people who appear to be Method actors auditioning for Idiocracy 2, and neither intelligentsia nor your basic Joe Halfwits talk anything like Mamet's model in this film. Oh, so the dialog's STYLIZED? Well, whoop-de-doo; if it's stylized, maybe he didn't stylize it ENOUGH because, really, it's not that interesting. And its delivery in this film is pretty uniformly stilted, wooden, and unconvincing. That's both the fault of the words themselves and of their delivery, but in this case I think we can deflect the blame for that away from the actors (well, most of them) and toward the Director who rules delivery of his sacred dialog with an iron fist. The whole also feels very _stagey_, as in old Dave forgetting or not knowing that film is inherently a different kind of medium than stage performance.I have the feeling that many who've reviewed this film are praising Mamet because it's the done thing to do. That the emperor's clothes are, at best, somewhat threadbare is of no apparent concern. The plot's interesting enough, though largely predictable fairly early on (and I am one who tends to let myself get immersed in a good movie, who's not ashamed that he didn't see the twists coming in films like The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense) and suffering from a tendency toward hammering us over the head with clues, whether real or false. Overall, I think, if this film's any indication then Mamet's work is at its best when directed by someone else. Obviously I have little on which to base this (like I said, I barely remember Heist and this one's cured me of any tendency to want to rush out to watch any further Mamet-directed films) but from watching other films for which he only has writer's credit I get the impression that his dialog and plots are far more effective in the hands of directors (and editors) who feel free to play a little more fast and loose with those structures and with actors who're working without metronomes.Sure, some actors may be thrilled to speak Mamet's words but I know a lot of actors would probably hate working with someone who demanded such absolute control over what was coming out of an actor's mouth. There's inherently a conflict between those who make the film and those who write it, but this film's one indication of how much weaker a film can be when the writer's vision is all that matters. Forcing stutters, incomplete sentences and repetition is NOT the magic key to writing realistic dialog and, anyway, a competent actor (or a halfway-competent actor under competent direction) should be able to improvise such realistic dialog delivery around the lines on the screenplay that, yeah, more often than not probably ARE too clean and neat to reflect real dialog. Mamet's a good writer, sometimes, but the fact that he's recognized that real speech includes stops and starts and tangents doesn't mean he's qualified to make a film that's any more realistic than average and when he does give such a try and fails it's a cop-out to claim that the reason it's not realistic is because it's stylized, or hyper-realistic, or that perhaps we just don't understand and couldn't begin to fathom the genius of the man.I've seen worse -- the recent The Marine still stands proudly high as one of the worst films I've seen, largely because I probably ruled out a lot more worthy candidates before I actually tried to watch them -- but this film's a bit of a dud, largely because it's mostly just a non-event and even the climaxes are anticlimactic.

Another problem I had with the film were the actual demons. They're small, unscary and way too cute to be very menacing. Not for a second did the film ever build up any type of suspense and not once did I feel that any of the characters were in danger.

This is the simultaneously disturbing and depressing portrait of an apathetic teenage generation in a lower social class suburban hell, with some of the strangest character drawings ever and an atmosphere that epitomizes nihilism, hopelessness and inertia. What makes River's Edge extra shocking is the fact that it's inspired by a real-life murder case as it occurred in California in the autumn of 1981. Although supposedly just loosely based on the case, the plot of the film is quite similar to the facts in the murder case of Marcy Renee Conrad. This is the type of story that would be grotesque and implausible if it were an entire work of fiction, but now you can't but feel very disquieted about our society. Samson John Tollet just strangled his girlfriend Jamie, but he isn't upset, remorseful or nervous to get caught at all. Quite the contrary, he reacts very disinterested and carelessly invites all of his friends to come and check out Jamie's lifeless body that he left behind naked on the riverbank of his hometown. Their reactions, however, are equally startling since initially none of them bothers to alert the authorities. Instead they prefer to get stoned, steal beer from the local liquor store and upset their parents by staying out all night. Layne, the uncrowned leader of the pack, even decides to help John get away with his inhuman crime and arranges a hideout at the house of the deranged dope-dealing Feck. River's Edge is a slow-paced and extremely unsettling viewing experience. The social criticism is literally crushing and much more bitter than in any other so-called 'coming-of-age' film of the 80's (and they were quite plentiful). The movie tackles the subject of the teenage slackers' disrespect, but also the adults' lack of parenting and teaching abilities. The adult characters in the story are almost as lamentable as the teenagers, like a powerless mother, an lightly inflammable stepfather and a science teacher stuck in the hippie era. Not to mention Feck, who's the embodiment of a bad role model. Yet, in spite of the overall very raw and nihilistic tone, River's Edge doesn't feature any graphical on screen violence or bloodshed. Jamie is dead from the opening sequence already and the later acts of brutality remain suggestive as well. This is a psychological piece of horror; harsh and mentally confronting! River's Edge is literally chock-full of amazing acting performances. Keanu Reeves is ideally cast as the gawky stoner and Daniel Roebuck is truly petrifying as the emotionally dead Samson Tollet. There's a particular sequence, in which he describes the murder in detail, where he's scary as hell. But the absolute most tremendous performance comes from cult favorite & and natural born weirdo Crispin Glover as the eccentric gang leader Layne. He's an unpredictable and mentally very unstable representation of teenage alienation. And then of course there's Dennis Hopper as Feck. What other middle-aged cult actor would consider playing a sex-doll obsessed, gun swinging and drug addicted lunatic?

The movie was overlong, boring and made absolutely no sense. I didn't find myself caring for any of the characters, it was horribly directed by Stanley Kubrik and was a poor execution. Call me contemporary, but I like a film where there is a little dialogue, not a complete hour of total silence. I have lots of patience when it comes to film (I enjoyed Citizen Kane, Casablanca and There Will be Blood) but I found this film to be super overrated and shouldn't even be on IMDb's Top 250 List. The Even if they cut an hour, this movie would've and could've been way better. I also heard that Stanley Kubrik cut about 20-30 minutes to make the pacing faster. What pace? It took 2 and a half hours to tell an hour long story. I would sometimes fast forward and I would find that I missed nothing. You'll notice I didn't mention anything about the acting. That's because there was little acting. The only thing we see is actor's expression and small amount of dialogue. The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars is for the HAL storyline. That is the only interesting part of the film.

I should start by saying that the version I saw was in the French language with subtitles, but there is a version dubbed into English featuring The Rocky Horror Picture Show's Barry Bostwick. Anyway, basically the story takes place on the planet Ygam, ruled by the giant blue humanoid aliens known as the Draags, and there are also the tiny human slaves called the Oms. A baby Om is orphaned by the Draags killing its mother, and Draag daughter Tiwa (Jennifer Drake) takes the child as her pet, with the permission of her father Master Sinh (Jean Topart). Even though he has a collar on him, the Om child that grows, Terr (Eric Baugin, then Jean Valmont) likes spending time with his owner, but he realises other Oms are being killed at random. Terr escapes from the Draag world and travels through desert land until he eventually finds the Om world and joins the tribe. When escaping, Terr managed to steal a headphone set that contains and feeds all the knowledge of the planet and the Draags directly into the brain. Armed with this technological knowledge the Oms build all the weapons and equipment they need as they plan to defend themselves against their giant enemy. In the end though, the Draags and Oms have killed many of each other in big numbers, but they both step down from attacking each other and find some sort of peace, as far as I remember. I was intrigued by how similar the animation was to style of Monty Python, the bounciness of how characters, objects and creatures move across the screen, and the (unintentionally) funny shapes and looks of these things.

Bonds allows himself into the game so that he can try and locate a Soviet encryption device. It seems opinions on the first two films and which one is better can lead to a hot debate but for my money this is the better of the two. The story is quite simple as our bad guys want Bond dead and will stop at nothing to make sure it happens. While the locations here aren't as good as the ones in DR. NO, the terrific supporting cast makes this film impossible not to fall for and the final hour makes for some great nail-biting. It goes without saying but Connery is once again at the top of his game and there's not a thing he does here that we don't believe. The role and performances have become legendary over the years and it's easy to see why as there's really not a cooler or tougher secret agent out there. Bianchi isn't quite as memorable as the previous Bond girl, which might be do the locations and lack of a bikini, but she still manages to be very entertaining. I would say that she gives the better performance of the two ladies as the screenplay allows her to be a little deeper. Robert Shaw is terrific as the robot-like assassin. The stern walk and menacing glare are perfectly done and you can't help but love this villain. Lotte Lenya turns in one of the greatest female-villain performances in the history of film. She really becomes this Russian agent and you just love to hate every single gut in her body. Pedro Armendariz, Bernard Lee and another fine turn by Lois Maxwell round out the supporting players. As with the previous film, I think this one starts off a tad bit slow but by the hour mark we're in for some great action and some wonderful suspense. The train sequence where Shaw has a gun on Bond is priceless and will certainly have all of your nails gone before it's over with. The final chase on the boats contains some great moments as well.
