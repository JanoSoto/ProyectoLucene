BUT - this would have to be one of the best movies of the 90's. I can say that now even after analyzing the f*** out of it this past year as part of school. Even after watching it a zillion times, it still sends tingles down my spine.The plot concerns Eric Draven (the late, great Brandon Lee) being raised from the dead by a mythical crow, given supernatural strength and invincibility, and sent on a mission to avenge the rape and murder of his fiancée Shelly (Sofia Shinas) by a gang of thugs. As he picks off the criminals on his hit list, he attracts the attention of the criminal kingpin Top Dollar (Michael Wincott), who becomes determined to kill him. Like I said, it is the people who cause this film to transcend the ordinary. Much of this is due to Alex Proyas, who uses an effectively stylized setting, clever editing, camera angles, etc. The villains of the piece are also excellent, particularly Wincott and David Patrick Kelly as head thug T-Bird. No Bond-style villainy is present here, these guys are evil, intimidating and cliché-free.But of course, the person who really transcends the ordinary is Brandon Lee. Lee was one of the few actors who could combine that sort of martial arts talent with acting talent, so evident here.

Lila Loomis(Vera Miles, returning to her old role full of fire and hate)will cease at nothing to see Norman locked back up and persuades her daughter Mary(the sexy knock-out Meg Tilly)to manipulate the poor soul by befriending him under a fake identity. Norman's doctor Bill Raymond(Robert Loggia, offering fine support, given a restrained character for once)tries to help him, but someone keeps calling claiming to be his real mother. This someone claims that the dead Mrs. Bates wasn't his real mother and whoever this person is takes up killing those who possibly threaten her little boy. The mystery of the plot is who exactly is committing the murders, and the film does point out that Norman couldn't possibly do it because of his whereabouts as strange occurrences take place. We see a lot of the film through Mary's point-of-view as Norman's sanity is crippling and this creepy mystery woman keeps sneaking inside room peeping through holes in the wall. Dennis Franz has yet another sleazy role(gosh, this guy made a living as scumbags in the 80's such as his blackmailing photographer in De Palma's BLOW OUT;and this one)as a foul-mouthed, belligerent blow-hard who ran the Bates Motel as an adult hotel where people could sleep around and partake in drug use..he doesn't take his firing kindly. Claudia Bryar has a key role as Mrs. Emma Spool, an elderly woman responsible for Norman landing a job at the town diner nearby the Bates Motel.I've watched this film probably twenty times over the years and this was the first time I ever noticed Hitchcock's silhouette in Mrs. Bates room when Norman and Mary enter it for the first time in the film..believe it or not, a tear actually came to my eye. I knew right there how much director Franklin admired and appreciated Hitchcock. The photographic work from veteran cinematographer Dean Cundy just blew me away. I got a woody when Cundy frames a shot from the attic window Norman peers out of trapped after being locked in by someone as the camera glides down to the teenage couple on the ground as they enter the basement for some play time. Just notice the MANY different ways Cundy shoots Norman so ominously(my favorite scene has Norman, almost lost, asking Mary if he has become confused again..when she tries to say he wasn't, Norman's eyes and face twist into this scary demeanor that is quite frightening)and the various odd angles for which he frames action up the steps to the Bates home and inside the house. Just amazing work..in my opinion, some of Cundy's best work to date. And, the score from Goldsmith is just haunting and melodic(..kind of even a bit sad). Written by CHILD'S PLAY director Tom Holland. Film's only real problem are the special effects like when someone gets a butcher knife stabbed in his\/her throat..there's no doubt that's a dummy mask. Fans of Tobe Hooper's MORTUARY might notice here that Lee Garlington portrays a rude, ornery waitress..she portrays the diner owner in MORTUARY. The closing shot brings chills up my spine every time. God, is this film underrated, or what?!

Dennis Franz has yet another sleazy role(gosh, this guy made a living as scumbags in the 80's such as his blackmailing photographer in De Palma's BLOW OUT;and this one)as a foul-mouthed, belligerent blow-hard who ran the Bates Motel as an adult hotel where people could sleep around and partake in drug use..he doesn't take his firing kindly. Claudia Bryar has a key role as Mrs. Emma Spool, an elderly woman responsible for Norman landing a job at the town diner nearby the Bates Motel.I've watched this film probably twenty times over the years and this was the first time I ever noticed Hitchcock's silhouette in Mrs. Bates room when Norman and Mary enter it for the first time in the film..believe it or not, a tear actually came to my eye. I knew right there how much director Franklin admired and appreciated Hitchcock. The photographic work from veteran cinematographer Dean Cundy just blew me away. I got a woody when Cundy frames a shot from the attic window Norman peers out of trapped after being locked in by someone as the camera glides down to the teenage couple on the ground as they enter the basement for some play time. Just notice the MANY different ways Cundy shoots Norman so ominously(my favorite scene has Norman, almost lost, asking Mary if he has become confused again..when she tries to say he wasn't, Norman's eyes and face twist into this scary demeanor that is quite frightening)and the various odd angles for which he frames action up the steps to the Bates home and inside the house. Just amazing work..in my opinion, some of Cundy's best work to date. And, the score from Goldsmith is just haunting and melodic(..kind of even a bit sad). Written by CHILD'S PLAY director Tom Holland. Film's only real problem are the special effects like when someone gets a butcher knife stabbed in his\/her throat..there's no doubt that's a dummy mask.

Lila Loomis(Vera Miles, returning to her old role full of fire and hate)will cease at nothing to see Norman locked back up and persuades her daughter Mary(the sexy knock-out Meg Tilly)to manipulate the poor soul by befriending him under a fake identity. Norman's doctor Bill Raymond(Robert Loggia, offering fine support, given a restrained character for once)tries to help him, but someone keeps calling claiming to be his real mother. This someone claims that the dead Mrs. Bates wasn't his real mother and whoever this person is takes up killing those who possibly threaten her little boy.

But I do not hold a grudge. 1984 is my favorite novel of all time and I don't think I would have been satisfied with any film adaptation. 1984 is a very difficult novel to adapt to film. The most emotional passages are not spoken, and the concepts presented are too numerous and too complex to adequately convey in a film of reasonable length. Before I present any specific criticism, please allow me to say that the acting was masterful (especially Suzanna Hamilton, who was great in the role as well as being gorgeous) and the cinematography excellent. There are no glaring defects in the making of the film itself, and I do not mean to imply that.The film rushed over too many aspects of Oceanic life. There were too many setups left out, which gave the payoffs less impact Winston's horror of rats is not adequately set up, nor is his queasiness about sex, nor are his struggles to discern what pre-revolutionary society might have been like. The distinctions between Party and proletarian life were not made clear, so the woman hanging laundry in the courtyard became meaningless. I think if I had not read the novel over and over again I would have been hopelessly lost in the film.The relationship between Winston and Julia had several holes. The subtleties of its formation were absent, as well as the harshness of its undoing. When they met after their re-education, they seemed almost cordial. There was nothing of the cauterized feelings of the book. And although their sexual relationship was portrayed vividly and splendidly, their conversations, which were so revealing and engrossing, were almost entirely excised. One of the key aspects of their relationship, which was not explored at all, was that they represented two different strategies of rebellion against the rule of the Party Winston wanted to act directly against the Party if possible, or in any event to thwart their efforts; whereas Julia had almost a split personality--she used a strident and orthodox exterior to hide a personal lasciviousness, while caring nothing about whether the Party succeeded or not. Many people today face a similar internal struggle Can the system be changed from inside? Do I make myself irrelevant by refusing to participate? Is there a middle ground? These mental struggles were absent from the film.In the film, the Party seemed evil and overbearing, but I did not get the sense of absolute control and helplessness that I got from the novel. The Ministries of Truth and Love were portrayed as being just as shabby as the rest of Oceania, when in the novel it was made clear that these were two places where the Party had really invested resources, so that they were ultramodern and efficient. O'Brien was not the awe-inspiring figure that he was in the novel. And his apartment, while cleaner and perhaps a bit nicer than Winston's, was not nearly different enough to make an impression--it looked more like an office.

I was a devotee of the original, and I had difficulty imaging how it could be improved upon. Watching Redux, I felt like the quality of the dialogue in the added scenes lagged behind that of the rest of the movie. Plus, rather than being inexorably pulled toward Kurtz's lair, you felt pulled off course by some of the scenes. All that being said, the added scenes do give extra insight into Willard's character. For that, I think they are worthwhile.In the original, you see the Captain as a shell of a man, haunted by the ghosts of things he has seen and done. As he travels down the river to meet Kurtz, you know that he recognizes the similarities between himself and his intended target, but you don't as completely realize what the differences are between the two men. This is important, because the differences are what give you hope that Willard may be able to escape the insanity that has overcome Kurtz.In Redux, Willard displays that, though emotionally damaged, he is still capable of compassion toward other human beings (namely the PBR Streetgang crew). In the infamous Playboy bunny scene, where Willard trades 2 barrels of precious diesel fuel for 2 hours with the Playboy bunnies for his crewmates, his actions are not expedient, but they are kind. Charlie doesn't get much R&R, Willard says earlier in the film. Yet, when he has a chance to grant his men what is basically a dying-man's wish, he does it unhesitatingly. One knows that Kurtz would not have not have done the same thing, having abandoned compassion long ago.Similarly, the French plantation scene depicts Willard as someone who, although racked by guilt, is not so far gone that he would refuse grace, in the form of a lovely, sympathetic French woman. Although I think the dialogue in this scene is awkward and clunky, I get the point. Sex becomes a metaphor for forgiveness, grace, etc. The person who is capable of accepting grace may be able to escape with their sanity. Again, Kurtz is beyond this, but Willard might not be.The added scene with Willard's encounter with Kurtz in the shipping container prison, surrounded by Montagnard children is also, I think, helpful in clarifying the ending of the movie. After his final, symbolic act of killing Kurtz, Willard has the chance to call in the Arclight strike, and destroy completely all traces of the compound. You sense that this is what Kurtz would have done, innocents, children, and all. Willard's turning-off of the radio back on the patrol boat is a clear rejection of Kurtz's philosophy of horror. With the addition of the scene with the children, you have a better sense of exactly what he is rejecting.In the end, I thought for all the remake's flaws, Willard's character came out of Redux as more well-rounded character, with a sense of compassion and honor. Even the act of killing Kurtz comes across more clearly as an act of mercy (among its other meanings). After watching Redux, the original film seems richer, and the ending a little less dark. For the doubters out there, my suggestion is to give Redux a chance (flaws and all), because it gives you an opportunity to watch the original with new eyes. Just remember the good parts, forget the bad.

Just remember the good parts, forget the bad. ","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"21 October 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Like many people, I have mixed emotions about AN Redux. I was a devotee of the original, and I had difficulty imaging how it could be improved upon. Watching Redux, I felt like the quality of the dialogue in the added scenes lagged behind that of the rest of the movie. Plus, rather than being inexorably pulled toward Kurtz's lair, you felt pulled off course by some of the scenes. All that being said, the added scenes do give extra insight into Willard's character. For that, I think they are worthwhile.In the original, you see the Captain as a shell of a man, haunted by the ghosts of things he has seen and done. As he travels down the river to meet Kurtz, you know that he recognizes the similarities between himself and his intended target, but you don't as completely realize what the differences are between the two men. This is important, because the differences are what give you hope that Willard may be able to escape the insanity that has overcome Kurtz.In Redux, Willard displays that, though emotionally damaged, he is still capable of compassion toward other human beings (namely the PBR Streetgang crew). In the infamous Playboy bunny scene, where Willard trades 2 barrels of precious diesel fuel for 2 hours with the Playboy bunnies for his crewmates, his actions are not expedient, but they are kind. Charlie doesn't get much R&R, Willard says earlier in the film. Yet, when he has a chance to grant his men what is basically a dying-man's wish, he does it unhesitatingly. One knows that Kurtz would not have not have done the same thing, having abandoned compassion long ago.Similarly, the French plantation scene depicts Willard as someone who, although racked by guilt, is not so far gone that he would refuse grace, in the form of a lovely, sympathetic French woman. Although I think the dialogue in this scene is awkward and clunky, I get the point. Sex becomes a metaphor for forgiveness, grace, etc. The person who is capable of accepting grace may be able to escape with their sanity. Again, Kurtz is beyond this, but Willard might not be.The added scene with Willard's encounter with Kurtz in the shipping container prison, surrounded by Montagnard children is also, I think, helpful in clarifying the ending of the movie.

I think the macabre humor is the stand-out plus for the film with two or three sequences very inspired. And, I was one of those who liked the possible love angle for Norman.Norman(Anthony Perkins, still very good)has been living quite a quiet existence until numerous things begin to take shape that will only result in tragedy. It starts with the whole fact that Mrs. Spool's disappearance is a constant reminder in the film. Her ghost looms over Norman as certain characters may possibly uncover what he did to Spool in the last film. The three most important characters in this second sequel change Norman's life, all for the worse in many ways.First, he hires Duane Duke(Jeff Fahey, perhaps overdoes he role), one of those pretty boy-white trash types with his all-smiles charm that wins over many a lady unless you're the type that sees through all that for what he really is. We see, though, a nasty streak permeate in certain situations that recognize that Duke is anything but the nicest guy in the world. He gives Diana Scarwid's Maureen Coyle a ride when she wishes to escape from a horrible occurrence and we later see the monster inside Duke as he tries to molest her when he pulls over because of a severe down-pour. When she slaps him for not stopping, he says adiós leaving her to stand in the rain. Later, he takes on a temporary job for Norman who needs an assistant to help around the Bates Motel(In an inspired moment, Duke tells Norman, I just won't be staying around too long. Norman, with that stuffed owl and it's wings spread behind him overhead, answers, No one ever does.)He picks up a dame at a local bar, and after she puts out, throws her out of his room with nothing but a shower of insults down-grading her.Second, a reporter working on a piece about psychopathic behavior and if they should be released from prison, named Tracy Venable(Roberta Maxwell)will not go away. She actually hires Duke to spy on Norman since he could probably notice strange behavior or other unorthodox types of behavior which might yield guilty suspicions of dangerous activity. She begins snooping around Mrs. Spool's life and is always trying to probe into Norman's life one way or another. If anyone will sniff out what Norman might do wrong, she will.The third character in the film is Maureen Coyle who looks like Marian Crane(the scene in which Norman spots MC on her suitcase, and his horrified reaction, are golden moments of jet black humor)and is so shaken in how her life has turned out she tries to commit suicide while staying at the Bates Motel. Duke, not knowing that Room # 1 is a no-no to hand out to just anyone, gives that room to Maureen only adding to the macabre joke that Norman's psychological baggage is carrying yet another heavy bit of luggage. When Mother decides to put an end to Maureen she finds that the young, tortured woman has already slit her wrists. In the most fascinating sequence in the film, Maureen is looking up at Mother, but she sees through her crazed mind, The Virgin Mary. After surviving the suicide attempt, thanks to Norman who just happened to stop by in order to drop off clean towels, they start a warm, friendly relationship which doesn't go over well with Mother. This is a film that is unlike the other two films because it is effected by the slasher genre(this is an example many users have already pointed out, but I just wanted to reiterate it). The violence that occurs to several people is much more potent and bloody. Perkins, as director, has a heavy religious sub-text within the story that shows how disillusioned poor Maureen is, and after accidentally killing a nun in a bell-tower, is searching for her own private island. She freely admits to a priest\/psychiatrist that lust was mainly why she couldn't fully become a nun and that might just end in bad results for her because of the location she winds up at. The Bates Motel seems to be a place that attracts people trying to get away from something. I think the mystery of who is killing is more than obvious. Sure, Perkins shrouds the person in drag with shadow, but the figure is more than recognizable if you look hard enough. Not to mention, there only a few possible suspects since very few characters frequent within the story. I can't tell if Fahey is just badly acting or if this character is trying to put out the charm loudly placing outwardly this facade of Mr. Nice Guy until his more sinister side comes out..specifically towards women. He might identify with Norman more than we think, and Perkins often photographs him as a disturbing type of fellow who might have homicidal tendencies. I feel he's a scumbag just out to make a buck, and always looking to bag a dame..he's your heel that you just know will eventually clash with Norman. But, as I pointed out earlier on, I think the love angle was an important step, even if it was merely inevitable that something(mainly, Mother)would cease it from forming into something amazing for Norman to shift his existence into the norm.

This was when Widescreen was a brand new cinematic invention, and we thought it was way cool to see this movie being shown of such surround screen magnitude in a theater that for our time (the 80's) was known as upgrading. The sound quality had much improved, thanks in part to LucasFilm studios, and the cinema scope (modernized for 21st Century) difference was incredibly awesome. We sat in the theaters, completely mesmerized by all the special effects, sound, and camera takes that previous teen films really didn't offer too much of. And the incredible 'water slide' scene towards the ending, alongside that magnificent pirate ship, sent shivers down everyone's spine, with incredible tingling sensations. We were all still commenting about the incredible experience, many years later.This film touches me in so many emotional ways, embellishing from back in my childhood Here we have a group of misfit kids, who call themselves the Goonies, being they live in a historical old section of a seaside village the wealthy yucks want to selfishly demolish in order to build a fancy golf course, with no recognition or acknowledgment of the residents' place, considering the area the slums or goon-docks (moderning,'back woods hillbilly-types') as they are thought of the lesser people's. Saddened and deeply troubled by the assumed outcome, brother's Brand and Mikey bond together, and try desperately to think of some way they can possibly help their working-class parents, along with the rest of the working-class neighborhood parents, keep the village free from the greedy hands of the developers. If only money was not the sleazy issue. As the story continues, along comes Mikey's small group of closest pals, nicknamed Mouth, Data, and Chunk, who fully understand their pals' plight. And humorously, bend to the affections of Brand (who inadvertently cannot take the boys anywhere, being he 'flunked' his driver's test), with methodical teasing the inability to cruise the town, etc. (mainly Mouth's comments). In order to ease the tension, sadness and pain, the boys farewell takes them into Mikey's attic, where a sudden turn of events brings them upon an old pirate treasure map. Of course at first the kids are skeptical, considering it just a piece of dad's untouched, stored antique collection, until one of the boys remembers rumors of an old legend of the village, of pirate adventure. Mikey is at first the only one who takes the legend seriously, and pockets an old Chalst found inside the map. Soon after, he convinces his pals to go searching for this buried treasure, because what if??? If there is indeed a secret buried treasure out there, then they already have the map to go find it, ease the boredom, do something exciting and adventurous for a change, and not continue moping around the house, feeling sorry. Alas, Mikey and friends go treasure hunting, only to run into the infamous Fratelli clan, notorious bank robbers on the loose, but then manage to escape, and continue embarking on their treasure-hunting journey towards the riches each of them only ever dreamed of. The Fratelli's get hot on their tale, once they find out about the map too...Then meet Sloth, the kindly 'Giant' who gets befriended by Chunk (whom the Fratelli's take hostage), then escapes, and goes searching after the friends. Throughout all the special effects, the Indiana Jones-like adventure, and musical score, next up we get first-hand at the camera-revealing pirate mystery, as the incredible buried lost ship is finally revealed in all its resplendent glory. The Frateli's eventually catch up with the Goonies, threatening to defeat their riches pursuit, but are then taken down by Sloth and Chunk. The Goonies escape from the hidden cave, but not without sobby farewells....as the cave starts to unravel...Here come the Press and the worried folks, at the end, the kids getting their moments of news fame as the Fratelli's are finally apprehended. Then the climactic moment, while the Press is interviewing everybody....a secret legend is finally revealed a historical fact. Holy Mary, mother of God... the officer rasps. The pirate ship is seen, finally escaping its 300 year imprisonment, as the kids and Sloth watch it sail away...in the sunset. Mikey makes his final remarks, and blows the ship a kiss (ahhhh, thanks One-Eyed Willy).PEANUT ","genre":null},{"date":"21 October 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I remember fully when this movie came out.

We were all still commenting about the incredible experience, many years later.This film touches me in so many emotional ways, embellishing from back in my childhood Here we have a group of misfit kids, who call themselves the Goonies, being they live in a historical old section of a seaside village the wealthy yucks want to selfishly demolish in order to build a fancy golf course, with no recognition or acknowledgment of the residents' place, considering the area the slums or goon-docks (moderning,'back woods hillbilly-types') as they are thought of the lesser people's. Saddened and deeply troubled by the assumed outcome, brother's Brand and Mikey bond together, and try desperately to think of some way they can possibly help their working-class parents, along with the rest of the working-class neighborhood parents, keep the village free from the greedy hands of the developers. If only money was not the sleazy issue. As the story continues, along comes Mikey's small group of closest pals, nicknamed Mouth, Data, and Chunk, who fully understand their pals' plight. And humorously, bend to the affections of Brand (who inadvertently cannot take the boys anywhere, being he 'flunked' his driver's test), with methodical teasing the inability to cruise the town, etc. (mainly Mouth's comments). In order to ease the tension, sadness and pain, the boys farewell takes them into Mikey's attic, where a sudden turn of events brings them upon an old pirate treasure map. Of course at first the kids are skeptical, considering it just a piece of dad's untouched, stored antique collection, until one of the boys remembers rumors of an old legend of the village, of pirate adventure. Mikey is at first the only one who takes the legend seriously, and pockets an old Chalst found inside the map. Soon after, he convinces his pals to go searching for this buried treasure, because what if??? If there is indeed a secret buried treasure out there, then they already have the map to go find it, ease the boredom, do something exciting and adventurous for a change, and not continue moping around the house, feeling sorry. Alas, Mikey and friends go treasure hunting, only to run into the infamous Fratelli clan, notorious bank robbers on the loose, but then manage to escape, and continue embarking on their treasure-hunting journey towards the riches each of them only ever dreamed of. The Fratelli's get hot on their tale, once they find out about the map too...Then meet Sloth, the kindly 'Giant' who gets befriended by Chunk (whom the Fratelli's take hostage), then escapes, and goes searching after the friends. Throughout all the special effects, the Indiana Jones-like adventure, and musical score, next up we get first-hand at the camera-revealing pirate mystery, as the incredible buried lost ship is finally revealed in all its resplendent glory. The Frateli's eventually catch up with the Goonies, threatening to defeat their riches pursuit, but are then taken down by Sloth and Chunk. The Goonies escape from the hidden cave, but not without sobby farewells....as the cave starts to unravel...Here come the Press and the worried folks, at the end, the kids getting their moments of news fame as the Fratelli's are finally apprehended. Then the climactic moment, while the Press is interviewing everybody....a secret legend is finally revealed a historical fact. Holy Mary, mother of God... the officer rasps. The pirate ship is seen, finally escaping its 300 year imprisonment, as the kids and Sloth watch it sail away...in the sunset. Mikey makes his final remarks, and blows the ship a kiss (ahhhh, thanks One-Eyed Willy).PEANUT ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family"},{"date":"21 October 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I remember fully when this movie came out. This was when Widescreen was a brand new cinematic invention, and we thought it was way cool to see this movie being shown of such surround screen magnitude in a theater that for our time (the 80's) was known as upgrading. The sound quality had much improved, thanks in part to LucasFilm studios, and the cinema scope (modernized for 21st Century) difference was incredibly awesome.

I put off watching it for so long for this reason, but it was enjoyable enough.Comparisons to the LOTR trilogy are inevitable, so I'm not going to avoid it. I didn't really like the LOTR trilogy. It just seemed to be a bunch of movies that everyone was forced to like and if you didn't then there must be something wrong with you. Yes, they are much, much better made than the rather quaint D&D, but if you want a smaller, unassuming fantasy ride then don't completely rule this movie out.The visual effects and production design of D&D are very similar to Paul Anderson's Mortal Kombat. Yes, it looks fake, but with just a little bit of suspension of disbelief you'll not even notice. I have a feeling that Courtney Solomon tried really hard to make it a good film but his talent doesn't extend as far as his enthusiasm.In terms of character and story it is all pretty bland and generic. There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen somewhere else. The actors do their best with the tepid dialogue and almost manage to not look embarrassed. The best thing about the film is it's surprisingly ferocious (maybe a bit too OTT) sound design. And the Dragon fight at the end was impressive for a medium budget film.I was actually surprised to find Joel Silver's name on the closing credits. I will assume that without him the film would have been a REAL stinker. And what's with that ending? Either way, I am still interested in the sequel.

When I heard that this was done by Baz Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, who later went on to create Moulin Rouge together, which is one of my favorite love stories(granted, at the time I first saw it, that was a pretty short list) of all time, as well as just about the only true musical that I've found myself enjoying, naturally I was going to watch it. Plus, it's difficult to challenge the quality of William Shakespeare's writings, and this is said to be one of his best works. The idea is magnificent; take the original story and retell it in modern day suburbia, with the original dialog(though, obviously, unfortunately, not all the dialog could be retained; I was disappointed to find that the brief exchange regarding how deep was the cut was not in the film). The result works out very well, by changing the setting to one that today's youth can easier relate to, whilst still making the points that the original play did. The plot is very good, and evolves nicely throughout. The pace is *intense*. This thing moves non-stop. Blink and you'll miss something. At times, this speed was almost overwhelming. The running time is two (exactly!) hours, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost all of it. The editing seems to bear traces of this... more often than not, it seems like the scene or certain cuts of it had been trimmed by a few seconds, to ensure the run-time length, and it can be a little confusing(for the quite few times it happens). I will say that Luhrmann kept the pace at an appropriate rate for the dramatic scenes. In fact, they may become even stronger, from the otherwise extreme pace. The line-delivery is fast, but exceptional. The acting is excellent. I can't name a single performance that I found even slightly flawed. The casting is marvelous, as well... the two leads and the supporting players are spot-on(heck, even Jamie Kennedy worked, here). The music is a good mix of hip, new music and a beautiful score. Production values are high. The cinematography causes a confusing moment or two, but it mostly simply serves to keep the intensity up. A well-done modernization of the famous play. I recommend this to any fan of the people involved in making it, and\/or William Shakespeare. Do keep in mind that there are various creative decisions made, changing the original tale... including one regarding the famous ending. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 October 2006","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I hadn't heard all of this story before watching this film, so please forgive me any misunderstandings that may come as a result of that ignorance.
