I haven't even rated this movie... it just doesn't deserve a rating.The acting was at best vain, John Trivalta was doing a fine job of showing over acting at its finest. The main guy, can't be bothered to remember his name, did such a bad job it was like he was reading of Que cards. He was so wooden and unbelievable i'm not joking i've seen people in my 9 year old cousins plays that where better. The rest of the people in this film where so forgettable i've forgotten them.The Story must have been written under the influence. I am a writer myself, and Mr H.L Hobberd (Or what ever his name was) must not have been a very good writer to come up with this shameful story. He either wasn't a born writer or he must have been high and thought 'I know, I'll have an earth 1,000 years in the future, a race of the Stupidist Aliens to ever become Space faring in control and a disgruntled ex monkey lead a fight against them... yes! brilliant' This could have worked, if you gave it to a man like Isic Asemov or some one, but here it doesn't.The story is simple (Not in the good way) Aliens have taken over, force humanity to mine gold... for some reason, and reduce Mankind's numbers to the miners that work for them and a few isolated tribes scattered here and there. When one man, the protagonist, leaves his tribes camp, again... for some unknown reason, leaving his girl friend and all, and travels to a ruined Denver where he is captured by the camp Aliens. These Alens, known as the Pychelo, make him mine gold. He escapes (Yeh, cleaver Aliens huh?) but is caught again. Then promises to mine them gold from the Rockys with equipment, Which they agree to... for some reason, wouldn't it give the humans a sense of independence? Where the humans discover a stash of 'old' U.S. Militery equipment, yet, they are brand new, shiny, clean, and fully fuelled ready to fight (again, for some unexplained reason)The humans begin to learn how to use them them using a flight simulator (Which is powered by magical fairy dust i suppose?) and when the Alien's come to collect there gold the humans (This is my favourite part of the whole film) pay them off with already smelted Gold that they found in a nearby castle with a big nylon sign saying 'Fort Noix' pointing to it... OK, it was a big exaggeration but that's almost what it's like. 1,000 years occupation and these morons that claim to be superior to us in every way and with an unexplained unquenchable thirst for gold has not found Fort Noix. Now these cleaver Aliens have given our hero an 'Inteligance Machine' from which he can learn everything about the Alein's race, Militry, Langige and Culture. I suppose it's a reference to the 'Stupidity Machine' every one who worked on this film was forced at gun point to go though. That will not make the Humans more dangerous now will it? and on top of that, They take him to the great library in Washington D.C. and show him a 1,000 year old book (That is still legible? impressive) and the Declaration of Indipendance (That's in perfect condition, wow how time flys)That will not give the humans further drive now will it? Then, I must have fell asleep as there was a small skirmish, a plan that made less sense than one Paris Hilten getting a Deploma, Planes flying around not doing a great deal (That they learnt how to fly in just a week? Has anyone in this film have any form of knowledge on planes at all?) and preforming all kinds of menovers that I know myself a British made Harrior can not do. Then the Aliens give up and retreat. Then the humans get an Atomic bomb that is so new you can imagine it still in it's Argos package and send some poor sapp on a suicide mission to the home planet of the Pychlo by means of a Teliport system. Then more stupidity and the bomb explodes, destroying the entire Pychlo planet... I kid you not... I guess with Nagasaki and all we where very lucky.The Camira work was a joke, it was always on a slant and my neck hurt by the end of the movie trying to get the full picture. At first I thought there was something wrong with my TV set so I changed it over to BBC 2 and it was fine... Mock the Week was just finnishing and I was depressed with the other channels so reluctantly, I switched over to BBC1 and Battlefeild Earth. Now don't get me wrong, the 70 million they plundered on this movie was not entirely wasted (just mostly) the visuals where stunning. The overview of earth at the beginning was a real bit of eye candy that taken my very breath away... shame it was on a tilt.The production and execution of the film was the worst of all Hollywood's history. I wouldn't have been surprised if they had captured a Monkey from the Amazon, put him in a suit so no one would know it Animal Cruelty, and forced him to work on this film under punishment of castration.As a film, this was eye bleedingly bad, as an Epic is needs to be destroyed, as a story it had the odd power of draining your very I.Q by a massive 40 points.

When his gang turns against him, he is caught by the police and sent to prison. From there, he undergoes a treatment to cure his violent urges. Will it work?Casting I think the cast was perfect, and this is Malcolm MacDowell's most recognizable role. Watching Clockwork Orange tends to lead to the debate of what's Kubrick's best film, as he has made so many classics. Many would say 2001, but this film puts up a good fight. But you really never hear people debate their favorite Malcolm film role, because it's invariably going to be this one, I think.Imagery Kubrick uses vibrant colors and some odd images. The milk bar is especially unusual, and sexual imagery appears all over in even the most ordinary of places. The cat house? A sign that says home? Very unusual stuff. The strong Christ imagery? Intense. From my recollection of the book, it was never this extreme and we have Kubrick to thank for such a radical interpretation of futuristic England.Music Obviously, Beethoven's 9th plays a key role in this and it's worked in well. But also, the synthesized music fits (such as in the record store). I don't know if it makes you think of the future, but it certainly makes you think this is a very foreign place from the world we know today (yet, the lessons and morals here are just as important).Some discussions could be attached to this film -- is it right to limit a man's choices, even if the choices eliminated are bad? In real life, is it okay to chemically castrate rapists rather than have them make their own choices? Is human nature defined by free choice, or are we predisposed? There is lots of room for discussion of these and other topics.If you haven't seen this, see it. I don't recall anyone ever leaving this film unchanged. It tends to be more easily accepted by men than women, for some reason, and I've been hesitant to recommend it to women. Some have said they don't get it and others can't get past the rape scene (which is disturbing, but serves to drive the point home). But then again, I had a female professor who had us read the book (I had already read it at that point). So, who knows. Really, this film is the very definition of morality, freedom and the nihilistic future we're heading towards.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"26 July 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" How can the pairing of Jack Nicholson and Stanley Kubrick, right after a decade of their best work in the movie industry, fail? With The Shining, we get one of the best thrillers to ever grace the silver screen. There is no need for special effects or gross-out gore like the so- called horror films currently being churned out. Instead we get an amazing lead performance from Nicholson, showing a descent into the hell of insanity, and the visual genius that was Kubrick behind the camera.The best literary adaptations are those that take the source material and make something unique out of it. Film is a totally separate medium and most novels can't be transferred word for word; books just aren't meant to be especially cinematic. With The Shining, we are given something that is no longer Stephen King's story. Sure the crux of the tale remains intact, but a singular mind like Kubrick allows himself to take the basics and craft them into a piece of art that lends itself to the medium being used to express it. Thus, rather than bore us with people talking to explain what is described to us in a book&#151;like The Da Vinci Code amongst others&#151;we are able to join this family for their winter taking care of the Overlook Hotel. The visuals speak for themselves and it is the inner turmoil and setting in of cabin fever that really takes over the story to become a force in and of itself.There are so many moments and frames of imagery that will stick in your mind for the rest of your life. Between the twin sisters and the sharp cuts to them butchered on the floor, to the blood spilling out from an elevator, to the old woman in room 237, they bring chills just reminiscing. Not to mention the crazy, what the hell just happened moments, like that of the bear and butler alone in their room, whatever evil residing inside the hotel has a keen ability to unsettle and terrorize those that threaten its motives and enjoyment. There could also be no one better to shoot the film then Kubrick and his knack for cinematography and composition. With his visual style, I still can't believe he shot many of his movies in fullscreen format. Having the ability to shoot widescreen seems a natural fit, but something about the 11.33 ratio spoke to him. Along with the gorgeous angles and points of view, he orchestrates an amazing score and sound effects track. Being low to the ground as we follow young Danny Torrance on his big wheel not only puts us into the action, but the loud sounds of the wheels turning on the hardwood floor and being momentarily muffled by the area rugs along the way add a sense of foreboding and anxiousness that remains prevalent throughout.Besides the technical craft that went in to the film, we have some stellar acting performances. What can be said about Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance? He always holds that touch of temper hiding behind his too gracious smile at the beginning, and once we hear his wife's tale about why he stopped drinking, you start to realize what he may be capable of. When the voices and visions projected onto him by the hotel finally seep into his head, the real fun begins. His facial expressions, tone of voice, and overall demeanor bring laughs to the audience, but they are just as much for comic reasons as they are for the viewers' unease, smirking out of fear for what this dangerous man might do. The role could have overshadowed everything else, but the success in this film lies in the fact that all fronts work cohesively. Even the abysmal Shelley Duvall doesn't seem too bad here. Her faces of fear are almost too real and her amateurish acting quality lends itself well to the naïve wife dutifully staying by the side of her husband. We are also treated by two wonderful turns from veteran Scatman Crothers and newbie Danny Lloyd. These two experience the titular shining and are able to see what force lies inside the hotel. Almost used as a defensive mechanism to try and exorcise the evil, these two show the good and the bad of their gift. Lloyd is great as the young son experiencing the horrors and visions of past murder; you almost fear for his mental wellbeing. His parents must be credited for allowing their son to partake in such grueling and psychologically detrimental moments. Whether he changes his voice to become Tony or he convulses from what he sees in his head, I have to believe Kubrick shot his scenes in a way to not let him know the full extent of what was happening in the script. Either way, Lloyd has done only one more bit of acting in his life and seems to have called it quits. He still definitely made a lasting impression on the craft.As a final note to the perfection of this movie, it is fun to see how many moments have been used later on in new films. If you are going to steal, definitely steal from the best. A couple I noticed occur during the credit sequence and shortly thereafter.

With The Shining, we get one of the best thrillers to ever grace the silver screen. There is no need for special effects or gross-out gore like the so- called horror films currently being churned out. Instead we get an amazing lead performance from Nicholson, showing a descent into the hell of insanity, and the visual genius that was Kubrick behind the camera.The best literary adaptations are those that take the source material and make something unique out of it. Film is a totally separate medium and most novels can't be transferred word for word; books just aren't meant to be especially cinematic. With The Shining, we are given something that is no longer Stephen King's story. Sure the crux of the tale remains intact, but a singular mind like Kubrick allows himself to take the basics and craft them into a piece of art that lends itself to the medium being used to express it. Thus, rather than bore us with people talking to explain what is described to us in a book&#151;like The Da Vinci Code amongst others&#151;we are able to join this family for their winter taking care of the Overlook Hotel. The visuals speak for themselves and it is the inner turmoil and setting in of cabin fever that really takes over the story to become a force in and of itself.There are so many moments and frames of imagery that will stick in your mind for the rest of your life. Between the twin sisters and the sharp cuts to them butchered on the floor, to the blood spilling out from an elevator, to the old woman in room 237, they bring chills just reminiscing. Not to mention the crazy, what the hell just happened moments, like that of the bear and butler alone in their room, whatever evil residing inside the hotel has a keen ability to unsettle and terrorize those that threaten its motives and enjoyment. There could also be no one better to shoot the film then Kubrick and his knack for cinematography and composition. With his visual style, I still can't believe he shot many of his movies in fullscreen format. Having the ability to shoot widescreen seems a natural fit, but something about the 11.33 ratio spoke to him. Along with the gorgeous angles and points of view, he orchestrates an amazing score and sound effects track. Being low to the ground as we follow young Danny Torrance on his big wheel not only puts us into the action, but the loud sounds of the wheels turning on the hardwood floor and being momentarily muffled by the area rugs along the way add a sense of foreboding and anxiousness that remains prevalent throughout.Besides the technical craft that went in to the film, we have some stellar acting performances. What can be said about Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance? He always holds that touch of temper hiding behind his too gracious smile at the beginning, and once we hear his wife's tale about why he stopped drinking, you start to realize what he may be capable of. When the voices and visions projected onto him by the hotel finally seep into his head, the real fun begins.

Tell me he's joking.There is no way, NO WAY, anyone watching this movie could come to the director's conclusion without hearing it straight from the horse's mouth.

Even once you've been spoon-fed all the answers on the web or through the director's commentary, they're still full of holes and the actions of Donnie Darko still make little sense. At times his actions are the equivalent of blowing up an entire country just to kill an ant hill.Does that sound like a top 250 movie to you? A movie where the directors vision can not be seen without him explaining it to you? To me, that's the very definition of a FAILURE! The movie should be the explanation, even if it's subtle.

When the hoodlums are beating-up on Fat Moe (fabulous character played by Larry Papp), they put a gun in his mouth to get him to tell where Noodles (DeNiro) is hiding....that's not in the VHS....and on-and-on. Someday, I'll get the DVD, but I don't always like them. The VHS is so moody in its colors.Read some of the other user's comments to get the full story if you've missed this great film.....I'm not saying a thing about the story. I've personally known gangsters and they are portrayed authentically in Once Upon a Time in America - if you think they don't still exist, you're uninformed. They are a different breed than the gangstas who roam our streets today.I am terribly confused about the running-length of this movie....nearly every comment has a different time. I don't have ANY trouble with long movies....yes, I was confused the first time I saw it, but it's beauty drew me right back to it - you have to really get involved in this story, beautifully directed by Leone with crystalline cinematography. I suspect I'll watch the last half again on TCM this Saturday, good reception or not.Best is a personal decision I stand steadfastly with those who think this movie is one of the most moving films ever made. Bravo! to all involved - and I also agree with another user who rates it as 100-to-10.......Other ganster-films do not portray the hoods as real people - they were and are.....I've been watching them since silent-film days. Better than Godfather ?.,....by a mile !! Every adult should watch this movie, even if only to discover they don't like it.

I had recently seen some reruns of Beetlejuice, the cartoon series loosely based on this live action movie, after not seeing any of it in over a decade (since the early 1990s, when I was probably six or seven), but didn't really like it anymore. However, I WAS impressed with this movie when I first saw it. I even found it more enjoyable during later viewings, and liked it a lot! After not seeing it for a while, I just watched it again last night, but wasn't nearly as impressed with it as I was before.Barbara and Adam Maitland are a married couple who live in a large house in a rural New England town. One day, on their way home, just as they are about to cross a bridge, they see a dog in front of them, and quickly try to stop. They don't run over the dog, but they do fall off the bridge in their car and crash into the river! They quickly arrive back home, thinking they survived the accident, but soon learn that they are dead, and if they try to leave the house, they will find themselves in a dangerous place! It gets worse when an annoying family moves in, and the Maitlands are stuck with them! The recently deceased couple attempt to scare this family out of the house, but cannot seem to succeed. Is giving in and using a fellow ghost named Beetlejuice the answer, despite warnings?! Some say that this movie gets better with more than one viewing, and a while ago, after watching it several times, I could see what they meant. However, after my most recent viewing, I can't imagine ever enjoying it as much as I used to again. I still found some parts funny, but found that most of the funny parts involve Beetlejuice, and he certainly doesn't have the biggest part in the movie. Michael Keaton's performance (as Beetlejuice) is the only one that really stands out, the other performances are really nothing special. The movie is exciting in some parts, but also a bit dull in others. Fortunately, the good in this movie does outweigh the bad to some extent.Beetle Juice is a very imaginative motion picture, but that doesn't automatically make it a masterpiece. Tim Burton is a director with unique vision, and many strongly admire him, while some think he's a terrible filmmaker. Personally, I am a fan, but this is not one of my favourites of his. If you don't like Burton's films in general, I don't think this particular film would be any exception, so if you haven't already seen it, I don't suggest you ever do. On the other hand, if you are a fan of the director, and like movies that combine the comedy and horror genres, you would probably like Beetle Juice. You could even like it better with more than one viewing, though this MIGHT not be permanent.

The first one takes place on Perris Island, a boot camp facility where newly recruited Marines are trained before going to fight in Vietnam. It is a brutal training, its aim being solely to turn innocent men into killing machines, and the lifelessness these soldiers are moving towards is evident from the opening sequence, where they all get their heads shaved without as much as blinking. That, however, is nothing compared to how they must put up with their instructor's foul-mouthed orders Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) is one of the scariest film characters of all time, his verbal abuse of every single soldier, especially an obese kid he renames Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), being much worse than anything they could possibly experience in Asia.This point is proved in the movie's second half, entirely set in the 'Nam, where Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine), having completed his training, leads the rest of the unit in a series of bloody missions, behaving in a way that openly contradicts the nickname he was given by Hartman.Kubrick made another war movie at the beginning of his career, and though Paths of Glory (1957) resembles FMJ in its open anti-militaristic position, those two films couldn't be more different the WWI drama dealt with the injustice of war that takes place outside the battlefield, while Jacket explores the effect of conflicts on the human psyche. In fact, it can be said that the film's analysis of mental distortion is a sort of expansion of themes previously covered in A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, the director's almost morbid passion for humanity's downfall being at its most explicit in those features (there are also echoes of 2001 in the legendary bathroom scene, HAL's actions being mirrored by one of the soldiers).Strangely, though, the build-up turns out to be more shocking and memorable than the pay-off, the Vietnam section clearly suffering from Ermey's absence. The most frightening thing about his performance is of course the fact that he isn't acting a real Marines instructor who was hired as a consultant for the picture's first half, Ermey was so committed to the job Kubrick hired him on the spot. It is not hard to see why there aren't that many actors who could be able to shout obscenities the way he does, relentlessly, without ever repeating himself or hesitating (that he also improvised a large part, perhaps even all, of his dialogue adds to the character's iconic status).

By being a movie where the lead actors are Sean Connery and Michael Caine it can't be bad, now can it? Well, it can't and it wasn't. To be honest the movie wasn't quite what I expected it to be, but it sure was a great movie. The movie tells about two men, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan, who decide to resign from the Army and travel to Kafiristan to become kings. No white man has set foot in Kafiristan since Alexander, but as ambitious as Daniel and Peachy are they decide to give it a go and leave on the adventure.Being a story by Rudyard Kipling it has all the right ingredients what an adventure movie requires. The film wisely uses those ingredients, but after I had seen the movie I honestly thought it could have been better. The film just has this certain style of telling the story, which can sometimes be a bit long-winded. It does seem that sometimes there isn't that much happening and it may be unbearable for some viewers. Well it is a movie from the 70's and movies were different even back then, though it isn't a long time ago at all. Despite that it's still a great adventure movie throughout and when it's directed by John Huston (who has also written the screenplay with Gladys Hill) it is indeed guaranteed quality. The cinematography's used how it's supposed to, when shooting in exotic locations you must shoot the beautiful landscapes as well to give the viewer that certain feeling of a real adventure. We see all kinds of astonishing sceneries throughout the movie and overall the movie is shot incredibly well by using every resource the milieu has to offer.What makes this movie so great, despite the already mentioned and complimented story, directing and cinematography, is undeniably the chemistry between Sean Connery and Michael Caine. If the movie doesn't interest you at all, try at least for god sakes watch it for Connery and Caine. There's just this unspeakable chemistry which can not be described with words, undeniably one of the best I've ever seen in a motion picture.

There is also a clever dialog between Dravot and Carnehan, which is a real treat for the fans. And when there's written this familiar witty sarcasm throughout the screenplay there honestly couldn't be better lead actors doing it, Connery and Caine exceed it.The Man Who Would Be King is more than just an adventure movie. It also tells a story about a true friendship, how friends should help each other in tight situations and what a real friendship is all about. This evolves the movie into a beautiful story which also makes it surprisingly dramatic. Backed up by the fantastic music by Maurice Jarre it really makes you shed a tear, even tears. Despite the movie having an opportunity to be something much better it still hangs on to be a great movie by having such magnificent lead actors in it. When each other area works really well too the movie is much better than the ingredients given to it. Sean Connery and Michael Caine can't become kings, as they already are kings.

Although they have a few minor money-making schemes such as adding broken glass to food in order to claim compensation from restaurant owners, their real speciality is a trick they play on wealthy men. Maxine will persuade the man to marry her, using a false name and without telling him that she has a daughter. Page then seduces the man, ensuring that they are caught in flagrante delicto by Maxine, who immediately files for divorce and walks away with a lucrative settlement. They first pull this stunt on Dean, a dodgy car dealer, but Maxine has her eyes on an even bigger prize, William B Tensy, an elderly tobacco billionaire. A complicating factor arises when Page falls in love with Jack, a handsome young barman and the intended object of one of her cons, much to the disgust of her mother who believes that the male sex exists solely for the purpose of being cheated.This film is sometimes described as a romantic comedy, but to me it seemed like a comedy incorporating a romance, which is not quite the same thing. In a romantic comedy it is the love-story which drives the entire plot; here, the romance between Page and Jack is only one of a number of plot elements, and not really the most interesting. There are a number of very funny scenes, most of them involving either Sigourney Weaver's Maxine or Gene Hackman's Tensy, the ultimate disgusting old man, wheezing his way into his grave through reckless over-indulgence in his own products. (Tensy stubbornly refuses to believe that smoking is bad for the health). Weaver is particularly good in scenes where her character has to think quickly, such as the one where Maxine deals with Tensy's domineering housekeeper or where, when pretending to be Russian, she is challenged to prove it by singing a Russian song. (There is no real reason why Maxine should have pretended to be a foreigner; it was simply a plot device to set up this scene).There are, however, two problems with the film.

A complicating factor arises when Page falls in love with Jack, a handsome young barman and the intended object of one of her cons, much to the disgust of her mother who believes that the male sex exists solely for the purpose of being cheated.This film is sometimes described as a romantic comedy, but to me it seemed like a comedy incorporating a romance, which is not quite the same thing. In a romantic comedy it is the love-story which drives the entire plot; here, the romance between Page and Jack is only one of a number of plot elements, and not really the most interesting. There are a number of very funny scenes, most of them involving either Sigourney Weaver's Maxine or Gene Hackman's Tensy, the ultimate disgusting old man, wheezing his way into his grave through reckless over-indulgence in his own products. (Tensy stubbornly refuses to believe that smoking is bad for the health). Weaver is particularly good in scenes where her character has to think quickly, such as the one where Maxine deals with Tensy's domineering housekeeper or where, when pretending to be Russian, she is challenged to prove it by singing a Russian song. (There is no real reason why Maxine should have pretended to be a foreigner; it was simply a plot device to set up this scene).There are, however, two problems with the film.

Snape's character has a lot to do with the success of the film, because he must be oily and underhanded but at the same time complex enough to make the resolution believable. It's a really fun cast all around, with fantasy stalwarts like Warwick Davis peppering a cast of the U.K.'s finest character actors.

It sounded like Gonna Fly Now would be played at the beginning, but it was just a song that sounded like that one. The new, almost equally worthy theme started up after that, with scenes from the life of Rocky Balboa (even The Muppet Show!) as well as highlights of the career of Clubber Lang. Survivor's theme was used for some training scenes later and, with a tiger growling, for the closing credits. Purists who wanted Gonna Fly Now get to hear it during some quite exciting training scenes, and played by a marching band early in the movie as Rocky's statue is unveiled.Was it as good as the others? Certainly none of the sequels matched the original, but this film held its own. For the first time, Rocky is faced with the prospect of actually having to retire. Clubber Lang is the fiercest, cruelest opponent yet. And, of course, with Mickey opposed to Rocky fighting this monster (and for another reason I'd rather not mention), Apollo Creed does the training this time, and Carl Weathers gives the movie's standout performance. In fact, this may have been the best of the movies for those who like him.The usual formula applies need it be mentioned that Rocky can't win the first time? Or can he? Maybe Lang wants revenge. Can Rocky win the second time? Maybe.I'm not sure whether to call Mr. T a good actor. But he is definitely scary and menacing, always taunting, always acting like he can't be defeated. He just doesn't show a lot of range. And Muhammad Ali he's not--Ali had a kind side. One has to wonder if Lang ever had anyone care about him.Stallone gives a good performance here. He has to show doubt about whether he can continue. He certainly shows determination, and in some scenes where he should show fear, he doesn't. That is probably a good thing.Burgess Meredith is almost as good here as in the others, but he isn't in the movie much. Talia Shire has her share of good scenes too.Hulk Hogan is almost as menacing as T in the charity event, and one wonders how Rocky got out of that alive. Hogan's no actor, but his performance should satisfy fans of rasslin. For those concerned that scene is too violent, Rocky's son does ask if Daddy is having fun. That should resolve any concerns.As for later, I guess it's up to parents if they want to watch two guys beating the you-know-what out of each other.

Mike (Michael Baldwin) and Reggie (Reggie Bannister) continue their relentless fight against the evil Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), a ghastly grave-robber from another dimension who is slowly taking over the dead one town at a time. Mike, after the events in Part III, finds himself in a strange limbo of dimensions in the Tall Man's world, trying to save his own life and stop the evil villain.Being a big fan of the Phantasm series, I really, really tried to like this movie as best as I could, but I had a little trouble with it at times. Like each film in this series tends to do, it's style and overall tone is a whole lot different than that of it's three predecessors. Part III threw in a lot of black comedy and humor for some comic relief, which did draw away some of the tension. Oblivion sheds all of the punch-lines and humor, and gets things back to the gritty, scary world of The Tall Man, and for that I have some respect for this movie. It maintains this feel of inescapable terror throughout, and the utter bizarreness and the dreamlike atmosphere is strong as ever. The entire film is like one big nightmare that you can't wake up from, and this nightmarish feeling succeeds in making you feel uneasy.However, I do have to complain that at times the storyline becomes a little lost in the vast dreamlike landscape and bizarre imagery. It's hard to distinguish what is exactly happening at times, and this film challenges you to put some pieces together yourself, and I'll admit it is a bit tough in certain areas. It takes a little thinking and it's not a movie you can really understand immediately, so I will advise a second viewing if needed, it may make you appreciate the movie more. There are a few minor inconsistencies concerning the dimension-travel and a couple of plot holes that are never explained (one of them being, whatever happened to young Timmy from Part III? We are led to believe he died, but nothing is ever really explained, his character is just kind of sloppily thrown out of the picture. I suppose it isn't too terrible though because his character wasn't of much relevance to the overall story, but still).Beside the storyline becoming a little lost at times, I can't complain about much else. There are some truly frightening scenes here, and I have to praise this movie for it's atmosphere, cinematography, and the truly eerie feeling that it emanates. Michael Baldwin is featured much more in this sequel, and holds up well, as does Reggie Bannister as his long-time friend and co-fighter against The Tall Man. Angus Scrimm is just as scary here as he was in the original Phantasm. His presence is really something of screen legend, especially within the horror genre. The conclusion to the movie is open-ended for a sequel (as are all the endings in these films), but we're still awaiting another installment to try and help answer a few questions and possibly bring a close to this utterly bizarre gem of a movie series.Overall, Phantasm IV Oblivion is an installment that most phans won't be too disappointed with. Personally, I enjoyed it. It has some script problems and it does become hard to follow at times, but the surreal atmosphere and the downright ambiguity and eeriness brought through the imagery and the cinematography is really wonderful. It's a weird sequel, but I liked it a lot, all things considered. I'd strictly recommend it to phans of the series though, because all others will likely despise it. 8\/10.

It always brings a smile to my face as I begin thinking of my own childhood. That is really quite strange because the movie takes place in the early 50's and I was born in '77. That 20+ year difference doesn't seem to have any diminishing effects on this movies ability to relate to boys, young men, or older. I suppose you could call it timeless.As far as mood, Stand By Me is both serious and light-hearted at the same time. The 4 boys (main Characters) laugh a lot as most do, but they also cry and occasionally fight.The music is almost like an additional character. It fits the film perfectly and despite the fact that it's not my preferred listening choice, I can't help but hum or even sing along during the movie. The music seems to propel you back in time and it feels like your on this great adventure with the Characters.The entire cast is huge, and includes many well established actors such as Will Wheaton, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, Jerry O'Connell, and supporting actors including John Cusack, Richard Dreyfuss, and Kiefer Sutherland. I'm not sure about some of the spelling on the names, so please forgive me if I misspelled any.The one single deterrent in my opinion is that the language is rather strong. All of the boys attempt to be independent and rebellious to some extent and in the absence of parental figures they curse quite often. This won't bother everyone, but I felt the movie would have been just as great without the language, or perhaps with less (mostly in the beginning). It is probably more believable this way however, and i'm sure that was one of the intentions of the director.In conclusion, Stand By Me is over 20 years old now. Most people have seen it, but if you haven't then i'm suggesting it to you now. I'm quite sure you'll enjoy it, especially guys, but everyone should see it once. For those of you who already love this movie, make sure you add it to your home video collection. Enjoy this coming of age movie.

After seeing the fantastic 2007 version of Hairspray and hearing a lot of buzz about the 1988 original, I just knew I had to see it. So that's precisely what I did. I went right to Blockbuster and I bought it, expecting to like the movie for my recent obsession over all things Hairspray (I listen to the music from the movie more times than you can imagine). I really didn't like it very much at all. I loved a couple things (Penny getting shock treatment was HYSTERICAL and they definitely should have kept the subplot in with Prudy following them to Motor Mouth Records and being scared of all the black people. That was so funny when she went to the officer and she realized he was black and went screaming down the street!) but it was mostly really boring. Divine was good, but he was nothing compared to John Travolta, I'm sorry to say. I also felt that the movie was too short. I also really didn't like the woman who played Motor Mouth Maybelle, but some of the other choices were just perfect. I really liked Tracy (the always-amazing Ricki Lake). The thing that really annoyed me would be that there was always a line that they made into the songs! Hey Mama, welcome to the 60s! Link was pretty funny, and that riot where both his legs were broken was ridiculous, but pretty funny. The dynamite thing in the hair was a bit much. I just don't see how so many people could like the original! I expected much more from it, I have to say.So don't look here for lots of fun, although the laughs often surprise you out of nowhere. This original version was very cheesy, and while I know that was its intention, I just didn't altogether buy it. As much as I like John Waters, this movie really did not impress me. The script was fantastic and the acting was comedic genius, especially from the legendary Divine. I have to say, though, that without all of the music and the insane energy, Hairspray just doesn't feel the same or have that same magic spark about it.

Sarah Conner's in an insane asylum, and a robot from the future has come to kill her son. But don't worry, because her son (in the future) sent his own robot back to kill the other robot and save the son (himself). Yeah, it might not make sense from a time travel point of view, but just deal with it.What to say? Arnold is great, as usual (though this is no Commando). Edward Furlong is young, but does a fine job. I don't have the crush on him some people do, but he's cool. Robert Patrick is also awesome, even if he has creepy weird ears. And this is more action than you'll get in most films, which is probably what you want if you're watching this.There, that was my little review.

First of all, the mother's actions bothered me. Maybe the writers want us to believe that future man will have no human attributes, just self-centered and callous. Maybe that's what happens when the world floods over, millions of people perish and then we won't care about anything but ourselves. The robot inventor is also selfish. I was hoping there would be more interaction between him and David. But nothing and I think that was a bad idea. I thought it ended and then it kept going--I was quite confused. I am a sentimental person when it comes to movie endings but this time I deeply cried and then became depressed. I couldn't understand why but now I know it was because I had no answers to some questions the movie posed and then the idea of the end of our world and the new alien looking mechas lasting is depressing.I don't think Kubrick would have liked this movie. I wish he could have directed it. Spielberg destroyed this story.
