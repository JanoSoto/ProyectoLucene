Alexander Payne's Election works on many levels because he knows how to tell this story from a directing, editing, and writing point of view, and never loses sight on the real issue here, which are the tactics taken by the rational and the irrational when a big choice is about to be made.We get three people's stories told wonderfully all in a concise runtime, with development and intelligence to assist them. Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is your textbook, overachieving high school senior, who is determined, no, hellbent on winning the school council election and become the president - a rather petty, useless honor. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is a teacher at the same high school, and knows Tracy's secret side, where her seduction and relentless passion got her in cahoots with his best friend, also a teacher, resulting in a teacher\/student affair costing him his job and a divorce. After Tracy reminds him that when she wins the election, they will be spending a lot more time together, Jim, being a man with an ability of rational, critical thinking, feels he can dismantle her chances by persuading another student to run. This student is the slow-witted, but big-hearted jock, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein). Because of a skiing accident that left him with a severely broken leg, Paul is unable to play football this year and possibly the rest of his life, and feels his purpose in life has been discarded just like that. Mr. McAllister informs him that he is capable of a lot more than he believes and reminds him how unanimously liked he is with the students. Paul finally decides to run against Tracy, who was previously running unopposed, much to her dismay. It isn't long before Paul's revenge-hungry sister, Tammy (Jessica Campbell) joins the race, boasting a campaign on nihilism, saying that if she were elected, she'd put an end to school government to spare the class the trouble of sitting through another one of these stupid assemblies. Mr. McAllister works around the clock to assure Tracy's chances of winning are gone, and this is where the satire part kicks in. We see how worked up the man gets about a ridiculous school election which, SPOILER ALERT, winds up practically ruining his whole life.But, oh, what fun it is to watch everything unfold. The film will be more fun if you can fill in the characters, or perhaps be given the rare ability to connect with one of them. Within the first few minutes of the film, I scanned my head to try and pick a Tracy Flick I knew in school and was keenly reminded of the smarmy, annoying qualities she possessed.Election is given further amounts of care and attention because of its graphic emphasis on style. For example, all four characters, Tracy, Jim, Paul, and Tammy, get vital speaking time during the film, so it doesn't feel like a satire with caricatures instead of characters. Not to mention, performance-wise, the film is surprisingly observant, with Witherspoon giving her most involved and hilarious performance to date, Broderick doing some very funny work, and Chris Klein giving his most sentimental acting job in a while.As one can imagine, this is not your typical high school film. Its goal isn't gross-out gags or crass humor, but a comedy of intellectual heights and a satire on how a reasonably intelligent man, a teacher nonetheless, succumbs to such low standards just to tarnish a young woman's chances of winning a school election. While I vaguely sympathize with the Tracy character (Payne is careful in this department, not making one character intolerable or unlikable), I can't say I didn't crack a smile during scenes of her dismay.Starring Reese Witherspoon, Matthew Broderick, Chris Klein, and Jessica Campbell.

Dr. No (1962), starring Sean Connery, is the first James Bond film. Based on the 1958 Ian Fleming novel of the same name, it was adapted by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather and was directed by Terence Young. The film was produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, a partnership that would continue until 1975. In the film, James Bond is sent to Jamaica on an investigation into the death of a fellow British agent. The murder trail leads him to the underground base of Dr. Julius No, who is plotting to disrupt an early American manned space launch with a radio beam weapon. Although the first of the Bond books to be made into a film, Dr. No was not the first of Fleming's novels, Casino Royale being the debut for the character. However, the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books, such as M presenting him with his better-known Walther PPK. Dr. No was produced with a low budget, but was a financial success. While critical reaction at release was mixed, over time the film received a reputation as one of the franchise's best installments. The film was followed by a successful series with currently 22 films and a 23rd planned for release in 2012. Dr. No also launched a successful genre of secret agent films that flourished in the 1960s. Many of the iconic aspects of a typical James Bond film were established in Dr. No, beginning with what is known as the gun barrel sequence. The film begins with an introduction to the character through the view of a gun barrel, and a highly stylized main title sequence, both created by Maurice Binder. In his work on film, production designer Ken Adam established a unique and expansive visual style that is one of the hallmarks of the Bond film series.SUMMARY John Strangways, the British Intelligence (SIS) Station Chief in Jamaica, is ambushed, killed, and his body taken by three assassins known as the Three Blind Mice. In response, MI6 agent James Bond (007) is summoned to the office of his superior, M. Bond is briefed to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his cooperation with the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on a case involving the disruption of Cape Canaveral rocket launches by radio jamming. Upon his arrival at Kingston Airport, a female photographer tries to take Bond's picture and he is shadowed from the airport. A chauffeur, who Bond determines to be an enemy agent, picks him up. Bond instructs him to leave the main road and, after a brief fight, Bond starts to interrogate the driver, who then kills himself with a cyanide-embedded cigarette. During his investigation, Bond sees a picture of a boatman named Quarrel with Strangways. Bond locates Quarrel but finds him to be IN-cooperative when he interviews him. Bond also recognizes Quarrel to have been the driver of the car that chased him from the airport. Bond follows Quarrel and is about to be beaten by him and a friend when the fight is interrupted by the man from the airport who has been following Bond he reveals himself to be CIA agent Felix Leiter and that not only are the two agents on the same mission, but also that Quarrel is helping Leiter. The CIA has traced the mysterious radio jamming of American rockets to the Jamaica vicinity, but aerial photography cannot see the exact location of its origin. Quarrel reveals to have been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also tells about the island of Crab Key, owned by the reclusive Dr. No, who operates a bauxite mine, which is rigorously protected against trespassers by armed security force and low-scan radar. After finding a receipt in Strangways' house about mysterious rocks naming, Professor R.J. Dent, Bond meets with Dent who says he had assayed the samples for Strangways and determined them to be ordinary rocks. This visit makes Dent wary and he takes a boat to Crab Key where Dr. No expresses displeasure at Dent's failure to kill Bond and orders him to try again, this time with a large venomous spider.

It stars Geena Davis, Matthew Modine, Frank Langella, Maury Chaykin, Patrick Malahide, Stan Shaw and Rex Linn. Music is scored by John Debney and cinematography by Peter Levy.A film of many flaws, with a reputation akin to it being the devil of big budget failures, it is, however, a wonderful piece of piratical entertainment if you are prepared to see past the monetary excess. Famously cited as the film that bankrupted Caroloco Pictures, the truth is that Carolco was going under anyway, the studio had filed for bankruptcy before Cutthroat Island had even been released, the box office performance was irrelevant, it wouldn't have made a bit of difference. And while no amount of hard sell marketing could have gotten the film to make back the $98 million spent making it, it received no support from distributor MGM who were in the process of being sold, so finances for marketing were not available.Harlin's movie has all the pirate movie ingredients crammed in to the plot, though it is a standard plot that sees Davis as female pirate Morgan Adams who leads her charges on a quest to find the ultimate treasure hoard.

Call it 'the system', call it 'the power', call it even 'America', there's obviously one enemy that ought to be fought. Who? What? Do the Right Thing is precisely essential because it doesn't try to provide definite answers about guilt but to raise right questions about responsibility. For this &#x96;I guess-, the film was fittingly voted #96 in AFI's Top 100 Greatest Movies and although I don't believe it redeems some shameful Oscar snubs, I know the film is getting more and more respected.Always do the right thing? says Da Mayor, That's it? retorts Mookie, That's it! Da Mayor is the local old-timer spending the day drinking, meditating, giving advice and occasionally flirting with Mother Sister, a woman of the same generation played by Ruby Dee, Davis' real-life wife, observing the neighborhood's life through the window. The two veterans incarnate the attitude of those who know but don't tell, the wounds from the past exist but they'd rather be turned into a dignified silence if the advice wouldn't keep youth's minds in peace. It's not about fighting the other, but one's own inner demons.That's why reducing the antagonism to a conflict between Blacks and Whites is like imitating the fool who stares at the wise man's finger when he's pointing it to the moon. And speaking of pointing fingers, the most emblematic scene of the film consists of different protagonists facing a camera and delivering a racist rant until the local DJ, Mister Senor Love Daddy tells them to chill out. The iconic racial slur montage illustrates the sad reality that each one has and is an enemy. And in that hateful cacophony, only Samuel L. Jackson sounds like the true voice of reason. And his catchphrase &#x85;that's the truth, Ruth resonates as if he was the one who knew life's secret embracing the very love he made his nickname out of. And that's one of the most overlooked aspects of the film Do the Right Thing speaks as much powerful statements about love than it does about hate.The most significant example is given by Radio Raheem, Bill Nunn as the colossal figure who kept walking by blasting Public Enemy's Fight the Power on his boom box like a non-violent defiance to authority. His LOVE and HATE speech, echoing a famous scene from The Night of the Hunter, establishes the ironic correlation between love and hate as one is only possible from a heart capable of the other, and each one is a double-edged sword leading to potential self-destruction. Both Sal, the owner of the pizzeria (Danny Aiello nominated for Best Supporting Actor) and Radio Raheem, revealed their tender side during the film, but ... we all know that the road to hell can be paved by good intentions.Do the Right Thing is like a modern Greek tragedy, where no choice would avoid a disaster. And the Oscar-nominated script is a triumph in intelligence in the way it doesn't beg for cheap feelings of sympathy. You don't have to ask yourself if Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) was right or wrong about the pictures in the wall, but why this lead to the climactic riot despite the fact that everyone disagreed with him. I guess that's humanity's tragedy, the most violent people can be the most capable of love and vice-versa, and this highlight Spike Lee's undeniable writing talent when it comes to create real characters, truly three-dimensional.Take the most blatantly racist character Sal's older son, Pino, one of Turturro's greatest performances. At first sight, he's just a hateful bigot, but when you get to know him, you can see he's a guy who just hates his job, and the same bitterness can be read in Mookie's droopy eyes and laconic talking. The central character played by Spike Lee, a bitter delivery man who wishes to make a more valuable job to take care of his new born son and be a man in the eyes of his Puerto Rican girlfriend, Tina (Rosie Perez) One can even see both Pino and Mookie contemptuously staring at Sal when he smoothly talks to Mookie's sister Jade (Spike Lee's sister in real life), for once they are in the same wavelength, which is ironic since they're both wrong.The film is full of these insightful ironies where no reaction is expectable, Da Mayor tries to prevent Sal and his sons to be lynched by the angry mob, while Mother Sister cries and ask people to burn the fire down. People who suffered the most from racism can't stand the sight of their own people inflicting the same treatment they experienced from the depths of their souls. The climactic mayhem let the most repressed impulses finally explode, in right or wrong. Even the Korean storekeeper shouts that he's black to be spared, and ultimately Smiley, the stuttering militant puts in the burning wall two pictures of the great African American leader  Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X.And the film ends with two quotes from the two men, one insisting that violence is never the solution, and the other that violence is intelligence when it's self-defense, a key to understand the film's intelligence two people can be in the same wavelength and still be wrong, two others can disagree and be both right &#x85; and that's the simple truth, Ruth.

This touched off one of the goriest ending in movie history as Shaker after being shot to pieces by police and FBI bullets and cut to ribbons, by going head first through a plate glass store window, still had enough left to pull out a gun out of his ankle holster only to get plugged with enough lead that would have sunk a fully equipped and manned US Navy nuclear aircraft-carrier!

The acting was a little 'stiff' and the introduction of the characters was not very well executed in my opinion. But as soon as they come into the city of Stalingrad itself the movie took a better turn.The battle scenes can be quite gruesome, but very realistic as well (it's not as bloody as for example Saving Private Ryan but still limbs fly over the place). At this point, the depth of the characters also becomes more important. This movie shows you exactly what happens to normal grunts (in the movie it is once said that they are not all Nazis) under extreme pressure of an ongoing and fierce battle, and how they cope with the emotional\/psychological stress involved. What I liked is that it shows the battle not only from the German perspective (although most of it) but also from the defender's side, and civilians.At his point, the acting becomes very good, and I found myself wondering more than once what I would do if I was in their place. At first they are surprised that the Russians shoot their own troops considered as cowards, but they will soon realize that for them there is no viable option of retreat as well. Unless of course they want to end up as the enemy. The deprivation of sleep, food, and the stress of being in combat for months at a time is very well depicted. I can understand that some people will not like this movie, because it shows the human side of the Germans as well, and not just as savage beasts bringing terror throughout Europe (much like for example 'Der Untergang')However, this movie shows that we are ALL victims of such a terrible war, and in war the difference between right and wrong fades very fast.The ending to me was heartbreaking.

The ocean communicates by materializing physical human imitations, persons created from the memory of the humans - blessing or curse, attack or welcome gesture, who can know? According to Lem mankind thus has to understand that it is merely a speck of dust and irrelevant in the general order or chaos of things, however Tarkovsky subverts this view in his own interpretation and intentionally digs deeper into the human psyche.

To a horizon, clearly right in front of you, but which you cannot grasp, not even try to. Or beyond your own self, to something trusted, something so deep inside that it fails all description, eludes you, yet teases to understand it - after all, it has always been there. Few movies manage to point at both, like Solaris. This is a picture that operates on the borderline between the self and the unknown, between what is alien and what makes us what we are, and even more so Solaris' theme is in fact about understanding ourselves, the unknown, the bridge between these extremes... all wrapped in one of the most powerful science fiction stories of the 20th century, written by Stanislaw Lem.Lem's book focuses on the futile communication attempts between entirely different beings, humans on the one hand and an intelligent ocean-like form of existence on the other, a life-form which covers a whole planet while producing fascinating phenomena to the visitors from afar. The ocean communicates by materializing physical human imitations, persons created from the memory of the humans - blessing or curse, attack or welcome gesture, who can know? According to Lem mankind thus has to understand that it is merely a speck of dust and irrelevant in the general order or chaos of things, however Tarkovsky subverts this view in his own interpretation and intentionally digs deeper into the human psyche. His adaptation adds its very own spiritual twist to the source material and puts man himself back on center stage. Admittedly he opens up more doors than he gives concrete answers in the process, but in doing so he addresses profound philosophical issues in the scope they deserve.

It's an outstanding cinematic work which tells well the story of the incomparably brilliant mathematician John Nash, a schizophrenic who leads a very traumatic life, due to the fact that overusing his beautiful mind leads to such a frightening life. I am impressed with the depiction of the story which goes all the way from 1947 through 1994 when Nash received the award for Economics. The versatile Russell Crowe came across well in the character depiction of the overtaxed scientist who refused to take his medicine for his degenerative disease. Ed Harris convinced people that they should hate him for the harm he brought to Nash, even if he was a phantasm. Christopher Plummer was very good as the caring doctor, Dr. Rosen. Jennifer Connelley (my favorite) played her part well as the very concerned and very loving wife. The only thing that family members should have been concerned about were the graphic and scary scenes, such as the shock treatment and him cutting himself on the wrist. But overall, it was an excellent production. I'm glad I saw it.

Someone wanting a million dollars, that's who, and in this case, there are four of them. Walter Matthau plays the head of the subway police whose early part of the afternoon has consisted of showing what he thinks are non-English speaking Japanese members of the Tokyo Metro Board around their office. He's in for two surprises. A little lesson in diplomacy is followed by the worst crisis since a bomb threat turned out only to be a cantaloupe. Four men, dressed almost alike, enter the train at different stops. Since this train left Pelham (the start of the line up in the Bronx) at 123, it is in the middle of its journey between 28th and 23rd streets when the train suddenly comes to a stop. The four guys pull out their automatics, and as soon as headquarters notices, the train is contacted without the conductor answering. It isn't until one of them finally calls in that they learn that the remaining people aboard this single car (separated from the others) will be killed unless the city meets their demands.This is certainly not a comedy, but if you feel the tension of what the politicians, police and public transportation people are feeling, you'll understand why they have to crack wise. The unpopular mayor happens to be down with the flu that day; One of the women who works with the transit police has dropped her wedding ring down the john; and another officer is too busy reading the paper to acknowledge the influential Japanese VIP's visiting. There's also the fact that the terrorists don't get along, and one of them (Hector Elizondo) is obviously even more psycho than the rest. The transit police must get the $1000000 from the New Amsterdam Building on Center Street down to 23rd and Lexington within a ridiculously short time. This creates one of the greatest action scenes on NY City Streets covering a good majority of lower-mid Manhattan. It's as exciting as the chase sequence in Bullitt. There is an excessive amount of violence, but considering the plot, it is absolutely necessary.I found myself riveted to the screen from beginning to end, actually routing for one of the bad guys in spite of the fact he was a crook. There's a really funny brief bit concerning a drunk passenger in the hostage-held car that has a great pay-off. Not one false note to make this a great film. Some reviews complain about the cursing and unlikable characters, but NY City in 1974 (let alone today) is not Disneyand.

I often disagree with his politics\/point of view, and his messages in his films are often too preachy for me. But every time I see Jungle Fever, I think not only is it his best film, it's a phenomenal piece of work, that for whatever reason, is not often talked about among his greatest films. For me, it's kind of like how I think Kevin Smith is a terrible filmmaker, but I think Chasing Amy is very, very good. It kind of makes me wonder for both Jungle Fever and Chasing Amy if Lee and Smith are letting others do more of the work on these. Anyway, the acting and performances in Jungle Fever are of course phenomenal, with Samuel L. Jackson's first big hit as Gator, and Wesley Snipes is also excellent as Flipper. I believe none of these people were famous before this film, with the exception of John Turturro and Spike himself. The sequence where Flipper is searching for a drugged-out Gator with Stevie Wonder's Livin' for the City in the background is one of my favorite scenes across ALL films that I have ever seen. I also think that he and Scorsese have it right with how working class Italians speak\/behave...I grew up in an area just like that. Finally, the scene where the black women are all discussing lightness of skin as being more desirable to black men is often a third-rail topic in the black community, so I appreciate Spike's courage in showing this.If you've never seen Jungle Fever yet, do yourself a favor and do so.

There are some wonderful numbers- Make Em' Laugh, Good Morning, that one where the gal with the long leg dangles a hat in front of Gene Kelly- but the film itself is disappointing. I've always found Gene Kelly too arrogant and annoying to want to watch him as a romantic lead, a bit too uptight to be comic and his dancing's better in An American in Paris. Debbie Reynolds is cute but not earth-shattering. Donald O'Connor is fabulous- he's the reason to watch this film. His talent, particularly for comedy, exceeds Kelly's talents. He's definitely underrated.I was told that the whole spoofing of the advent of the talkies was hilarious. It's mildly amusing at best. The characters didn't really grab me either. It's a total myth that the story of a musical can get away with being complete fluff. Even if the story's a bit of a stretch (or a lot if it's Brigadoon), it should at least be entertaining. This film really ought to have simply been a revue.I think that nostalgia and hype may have clouded the judgement of quite a few viewers.

If she is not obviously a knockout, physically, then no I don't understand that view, since her pulchritude scores right up in the top BABE percentage as Kidman, Ryan, and the late Anna Nicole Smith. The Jurassic Park scientist who bounded across the compound running for her life(and Sam Neill) has the best legs of any actress in my mind. Laura Dern's acting competence is right up there at her feminine attractiveness.Different from the very popular Jurassic Park. The less well-known comedy\/drama is typically the old(1991) tape or DVD some person has back in a closet underneath a bunch of old videocassettes, eight-tracks, and various other old media. It belongs on a shelf next to Annie Hall or Beaches. Ramblin' Rose is a movie with a practical transference into a role of a simple but level-headed call girl in the South during the Depression Era. The woman is very down to earth, homey, and very sincere. But has a taste for good loving. Put it that way.The time is the nineteen-thirties, and Ramblin' Rose is a movie you could see with anyone, who is an adult and appreciates a good movie. It feels like a seventies movie for some reason.
