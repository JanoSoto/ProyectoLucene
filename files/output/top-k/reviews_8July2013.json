Simply yes. In comparison to the other princess films in the Disney Renaissance, this tops it but overall it isn't my favorite. The Disney Renaissance was film after film executed with brilliance and there are four films that would almost always be chosen either one as the best of the pack; The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. I fall in the group that thinks Aladdin is the strongest film but either one are great enough to be number one.The story team for this film, did a great job as they meshed the melodramatic tale ,that is commonly found in the Disney princess films of the past, with modern dialogue and humor that appeals to the newer generation. With Disney animated films, I expect to see funny side characters. The difference between the old Disney and the new Disney is that somehow the most memorable element of the cast is the supporting cast rather than the main star. With Disney's old films, the main characters were the memorable ones for me. The film is an endearing, feel good, romantic story; with hilarious dialogue; that will appeal to all ages.This film was directed by Gary Tousdale and Kirk Wise, and this film was their debut in directing a Disney animated full length feature. What a great way to start, they created a film that is now regarded as a classic and was the first animated feature to be nominated with Best Picture at the Academy Awards. I think they took the best things about The Little Mermaid and added other things that work. Their next directorial efforts for Disney did not achieve close to what they have done for this, although those films did gain a cult following.I felt that The Little Mermaid and The Rescuers Down Under in comparison did not have that beautiful cinematography that Beauty and the Beast shows. It's cinematography is one of the main reasons why so much of this film work, whether it's the beautiful and dramatic lighting or the way the camera moves in a particular scene. An example would be the scene where both Belle and the Beast had a romantic dance in the ballroom; the scene was lit gorgeously and the iconic moment when the camera starts from the chandelier and glides its way down to them dancing. I felt that this aspect of the film should have been awarded with something.As expected from a Disney film, it is going to contain musical numbers in it. I don't usually mind it as it allows the animators to show off something daring and outrageous. I feel that the songs in this film are much more accessible and beautiful, like 'Be Our Guest' and 'Gaston', rather than something grand and iconic, Lion King, or as fun and daring, Aladdin. Be Our Guest and Gaston are definitely the favorite of mine. Be Our Guest due to it feeling like a Broadway musical and Gaston because it is so ridiculously egotistic that it is entertaining. Also pretty much who has seen the film, would remember the words Tale as old as time\/Song as old as rhyme. The soundtrack is wonderful but I don't feel any of it out trumps Aladdin's 'A Whole New World' or Lion King's 'Circle of Life'.The voices of the film fit well for the characters and certainly gives the characters a bit of personality. The animators did a wonderful job drawing the characters as they look very clean and attractive. The animators pushed hard on this film as large amounts of objects or people move in one shot, and each movement has a personality of its own. Cogsworth and Lumiere are one of the best character duos ever animated on Disney.The film is an icon of its own and definitely ranks in one of the top romance films of all time. Beauty and the Beast is a film that would be competing against films like Casablanca and Gone with the Wind in deciding which melodramatic romance film is the best. If you are looking for a great romantic film or a Disney film that hits all of its marks then this is that film.

Filled with great direction,a wonderful cast and a fantastic soundtrack,Tuff Turf is an entertaining 80's Teen film and a fine guilty pleasure.Set in Los Angeles,Tuff Turf tells the story of Morgan Hiller(James Spader),a rebellious teen who's family has moved to Los Angeles for a fresh start. Unfortunately,Morgan gets into trouble with a local street gang who's leader Nick(Paul Mones)wants Morgan's blood. To make matters worse Morgan starts falls for Nick's girlfriend Frankie(Kim Richards) which angers Nick and leads to violent confrontations and chaos between Morgan and Nick who want to survive in the Tuff Turf.The 1980s were arguably the golden age of Teen films and there were Teen films that broke down into two categories Teen films that were recognized during the 1980s and became classics years later and Teen films that are obscure and little known but find audiences years later. Tuff Turf fits into the latter category. Tuff Turf is a flawed but entertaining Teen film that is a combination of Rebel Without A Cause and West Side Story with elements of The Warriors and Class Of 1984 and while Tuff Turf doesn't match the greatness of those films I mentioned and doesn't do anything groundbreaking in terms of story Tuff Turf is a movie works in it's own right. Tuff Turf is also a genre mash-up film mixing together genres like Teen films,Gang film,Action film and a little bit of Musical thrown in as well and I think the mixture of all of those genres makes Tuff Turf a guilty pleasure and unintentionally hilarious. TT is a guilty pleasure in a sense where you watch the film and like but you as the viewer are almost afraid to say you liked it. TT is unintentionally hilarious because there are scenes and moments in the film that are really supposed to be serious and straight-forward but are so wild and over the top you can't help but laugh at how absurd at how serious the film tries to be. Although Tuff Turf is silly and very funny,there are times where the film can be dark,gritty and violent with a Film-Noir atmosphere that wasn't seen in Teen films during the 1980s. Morgan Hiller is a great character because he's a rebel who uses his wits and intelligence to get out of tough situations and can handle himself. At the same time Morgan is a character with great depth and is multi-dimensional because while Morgan is a rebel he's not a criminal or thug but just a very troubled and confused teenager that has to deal with the pressures of growing up,his parents,falling for Frankie as well as trying to battle Nick and his gang. The Morgan Hiller character is one of the reasons TT is memorable and entertaining to watch and you will like him as soon as he comes on the screen. The Action and fight scenes are well done and memorable with toughness and great pace and truly adds to the film. At 112 minutes TT moves at a good pace,grabs your attention and keeps you glued to the screen from beginning to end. If there is a flaw with Tuff Turf is that the tone and genre of the film is very uneven because one minute the tone can be light the next minute the tone can be dark and serious. Also you never know where Tuff Turf is going to go and what genre it is. TT is a Teen film then it's a gang film as well as an Action film and all of those elements can make the movie confusing at times. I guess TT was trying to make a Teen film that was different from other Teen films at the time by making a genre mash-up film and throwing in everything but the kitchen sink in this movie and sometimes it succeeds and other times it fails The final 15-20 minutes of Tuff Turf are Action-packed and thrilling and a great ending and fun cap-off to the film.The whole cast is wonderful. James Spader is excellent and memorable as Morgan Hiller,with Spader bringing depth,charisma and humor to the role. Kim Richards is wonderful and beautiful as Frankie,Morgan's love interest and Nick's girlfriend. Paul Mones is fantastic as Nick,a gang leader and rival of Morgan and Frankie's boyfriend. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Jimmy,a student who becomes Morgan's friend. Matt Clark is wonderful as Stuart Hiller,Morgan's Father. Olivia Barash(Ronnie),Claudette Nevins(Page Hiller),Panchito Gomez(Mickey),Michael Wyle(Eddie),Catya Sassoon(Feather)and Bill Meyers(Brian Hiller)give good performances as well.The direction by Fritz Kiersch is great,with Kiersch bringing a great pace and style to the film,as well as great camera angles and movements. Wonderful direction,Kiersch.The score by Johnathan Elias is great and effective and matches the tone of the film. A fine score by Elias. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs from Jack Mack And The Heart Attack(So Tuff,Green Onions,She's Looking Good),Jim Carroll(People Who Died,Voices,It's Too Late),Marianne Faithful(Love Hates),Southside Johnny(Tuff Turf),Lene Lovich(Breakin' The Rules(What Do You Do When Opposites Attract),Dale Gonyea With J.R. & The Z-Man(Twist And Shout)and Jonathan Elias(We Walk The Night). Great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Teen Films,Gang Films or Action films,I suggest you see Tuff Turf,a film that's flawed and far from perfect but is entertaining,fun and is well worth your time.

","genre":"Action, Drama"},{"date":"8 July 2013","score":"","review":" Spoilers present in this review...We live in an age where personal technology has pretty much become something of a necessity in our lives. How do we know that no one is listening to our conversations or watching us while we are in our homes. Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation explores the culture and life of a man, Harry Caul, who works in 'surveillance'. This film was made between the Godfather films and released on 1974, the same year The Godfather II was released.Harry Caul is to do a voice recording job on a couple's conversation on Union Square and give the tapes to director, the man who hired him. There may be more to it than just a conversation and he becomes personally involved as he doesn't want something from the past repeat itself. The film also explores this man who, definitely is one of the best in the profession, have become so isolated and guarded. Caul is afraid that someone might be listening or watching him. A certain areas of the film, it also speaks about the technology and how something that may seem like a normal object may be bugged and recording\/observing you. The topics of this film, I find very interesting as it relates to the technology that is currently used today and some of us are maybe too naive to think that someone might actually be listening. Coppola has made a wonderful script and using a protagonist who has been mentally and emotionally damaged by his own work.Not a bad year for Francis Ford Coppola. Two films released in one year and both were nominated for Best Picture and one won the Palme d'Or at Cannes; one is very personal and indie, and the other is a big sequel to the best film of the 1970's. The Conversation was clearly something that he always wanted to make but the studios don't think it would be any good or they think he is not good enough of a director, so he made The Godfather and that made them think twice. The Godfather felt very grand, and Coppola wanted to make this film more subtle and quiet. This film is definitely slow when comparing to Coppola's other works but it works well with the subject and story that the film explores. In my first viewing, this was not something I loved and if i reviewed it then, it would have been a 3.5\/5, but after a few months I watched it again and the film felt different, there was so much more to it than I thought there was. This film is so enjoyable and the last half hour is so frightening, in a subtle way, that it would be in your minds a few hours after the film is finished.Coppola wanted the photography to be very simple but it's simplicity is effective. The film's opening has a great shot that starts at a height and slowly gets closer and closer to the important characters, and the film ends with a slow panning shot as Hackman sits in the corner playing the saxophone. The photography doesn't try too hard to show off something and this is because it is not needed. I like that this film does not try to show off like The Godfather or be heavy like Apocalypse Now.The score of the film, by David Shire, is also very stripped and simple. The score is driven by the piano and at times is supported by a saxophone. It is so stripped down that sometimes you may not even notice it's playing in a scene. There is a particular moment at the hotel where something happens and this static noise that adds to the imagery makes that scene so frightening.Gene Hackman is incredible in this film, his portrayal of this closed off character was great. He is the main focus of the film and the supporting cast doesn't seem to out play him. Coppola wants the film to follow Caul as he listens to the tapes and uncovers things. The film overall has a great cast, it has actors like Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, John Cazele and Cindy Williams. Cindy Williams, I was surprised broke off my impression of her from when I saw her at American Graffiti. Nevertheless this is a Hackman show and he delivers, this is possibly his best role.Many may not regard this as Coppola's masterpiece but it is a well made film about paranoia and the advancement of spyware technology.

How do we know that no one is listening to our conversations or watching us while we are in our homes. Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation explores the culture and life of a man, Harry Caul, who works in 'surveillance'. This film was made between the Godfather films and released on 1974, the same year The Godfather II was released.Harry Caul is to do a voice recording job on a couple's conversation on Union Square and give the tapes to director, the man who hired him. There may be more to it than just a conversation and he becomes personally involved as he doesn't want something from the past repeat itself. The film also explores this man who, definitely is one of the best in the profession, have become so isolated and guarded. Caul is afraid that someone might be listening or watching him. A certain areas of the film, it also speaks about the technology and how something that may seem like a normal object may be bugged and recording\/observing you. The topics of this film, I find very interesting as it relates to the technology that is currently used today and some of us are maybe too naive to think that someone might actually be listening. Coppola has made a wonderful script and using a protagonist who has been mentally and emotionally damaged by his own work.Not a bad year for Francis Ford Coppola. Two films released in one year and both were nominated for Best Picture and one won the Palme d'Or at Cannes; one is very personal and indie, and the other is a big sequel to the best film of the 1970's. The Conversation was clearly something that he always wanted to make but the studios don't think it would be any good or they think he is not good enough of a director, so he made The Godfather and that made them think twice. The Godfather felt very grand, and Coppola wanted to make this film more subtle and quiet. This film is definitely slow when comparing to Coppola's other works but it works well with the subject and story that the film explores. In my first viewing, this was not something I loved and if i reviewed it then, it would have been a 3.5\/5, but after a few months I watched it again and the film felt different, there was so much more to it than I thought there was. This film is so enjoyable and the last half hour is so frightening, in a subtle way, that it would be in your minds a few hours after the film is finished.Coppola wanted the photography to be very simple but it's simplicity is effective. The film's opening has a great shot that starts at a height and slowly gets closer and closer to the important characters, and the film ends with a slow panning shot as Hackman sits in the corner playing the saxophone. The photography doesn't try too hard to show off something and this is because it is not needed. I like that this film does not try to show off like The Godfather or be heavy like Apocalypse Now.The score of the film, by David Shire, is also very stripped and simple. The score is driven by the piano and at times is supported by a saxophone. It is so stripped down that sometimes you may not even notice it's playing in a scene. There is a particular moment at the hotel where something happens and this static noise that adds to the imagery makes that scene so frightening.Gene Hackman is incredible in this film, his portrayal of this closed off character was great. He is the main focus of the film and the supporting cast doesn't seem to out play him. Coppola wants the film to follow Caul as he listens to the tapes and uncovers things. The film overall has a great cast, it has actors like Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, John Cazele and Cindy Williams. Cindy Williams, I was surprised broke off my impression of her from when I saw her at American Graffiti. Nevertheless this is a Hackman show and he delivers, this is possibly his best role.Many may not regard this as Coppola's masterpiece but it is a well made film about paranoia and the advancement of spyware technology.

But then there's Stanley Kubrick a man that explored completely different topics with each of his films, yet never without leaving his thumbprint on the work. And while I don't adore every single one of his movies as much as some others, I can't find a single bad movie he made in his entire career. He may have been unfaithful to the source material he was given (Anthony Burgess and Stephen King both publicly vented their displeasure with his adaptions of A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, respectively), but he always created a uniquely interesting movie. The Shining is my personal favorite.His 9th full-length movie and his only foray into horror confronts the audience with a seemingly normal American family in the 70's. The father, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson arguably doing the best turn in his career), is an unsuccessful writer that gladly accepts a job as a caretaker for an isolated hotel in the Rocky Mountains since he expects a lot of leisure time to focus on his new writing project. His wife, played by Shelley Duvall and his approximately 10-year-old son accompany him. The two will be the only people he sees during the freezing winter months. Kubrick doesn't waste too much time with exposition; the movie starts to get quite frightening after a couple of minutes in. Actually, the opening scene already gives you goosebumps because of the ultra-chilling theme that would probably make a cat feeding its kittens seem frightening. We already get a glimpse of the prodigious set design and the huge symbolism after that, even though the real horror is yet to come. The audience, together with Jack, learns some ghastly background stories about the hotel and Nicholson's crazy grinning gives us justified reason to expect that his character isn't the sanest fellow in this movie. It is also revealed that Danny, Jack's son, is suffering from 'Shining', an illness\/ability that gives him various abnormal skills which his parents seem to overlook. Contrary to most horror movies, the audience can't predict what's going to happen in The Shining, a chilling masterpiece that doesn't make you jump out of your seat or disturb you by excessive amounts of gore, but totally works against the 'rules' of its genre. And still, Kubrick manages to scare the hell out of you and give you nightmares of two little twins standing in front of you or even naked women (if you've seen the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about). The American auteur understands the concept of psychological horror and perfects it in this movie seeing some things from the perspective of the young boy Danny was a masterful move and the rides through the hotel never fail to creep me out. Those scenes in the first half of the movie actually have always scared me more than the dramatic climax, an undoubtedly intense and well-made chasing sequence that, however, suffers from a simple, almost banal structure. It can be said that Kubrick created an extremely intense atmosphere in The Shining and that it's one of the most genre-defining horror movies of all time, yet there's another aspect of the film that should be treated with at least the same amount of attention. Its symbolism, greater than in any other Kubrick's movies, and so comprehensive that some fanatics made a feature-length documentary entirely focusing on the hidden meanings in it last year - fittingly named after the mysterious Room 237 in the original movie - is sheerly unbelievable. While some theories (Minotaurs; The Holocaust) really got carried away, I like to believe that many of the ideas, written on countless blogs in the Internet, were actually intended by this weird genius named Stanley Kubrick. The exceptionally long shooting process and the exasperation some cast members (especially Duvall and supporting star Scatman Crothers) developed are indicating that Kubrick was in fact aiming for absolute perfection with this movie. You don't even have to tinker with the movie on Internet blogs and studying each frame like the creators of Room 237 did isn't necessary either; you can be fascinated by The Shining just because of the strangeness that lies in every single scene. It's almost impossible to describe the brilliancy in some of them - Kubrick's use of colors, numbers, or the Steadicam are just perfect. Even the editing, a part of movies that most cinema-goers (including myself) tend to overlook, is fantastic.Most of the cast members in the movie did quite good in the movie with Danny Lloyd acting impressively realistic for such a young age, but main actor Jack Nicholson is incredible at portraying the growing insanity of his character. His grumpy psychopath has got to be one of the most iconic villains in film and the fact that he didn't even get an Oscar nomination for this role is clearly one of the biggest snubs in the history of the Academy. And, of course, the Here's Johnny part wouldn't have been nearly as good without Nicholson who gives a gripping intensity to this and every other scene he's in. It's a bit sad that his on-screen wife Duvall is so completely unable to keep up with his terrific performance, but still, nominating her for a Razzie Award was a big exaggeration.THE VERDICT The Shining is an insane horror trip that is likely to haunt you and fascinate you on the same level.

The film was great. It is clearly a classic but it also has its faults. It doesn't necessarily feel dated, in fact it holds up pretty well comparatively to other classics in the same vein. The French countryside is stunning and beautiful and a near perfect setting for the film. It certainly presents itself as thriller, its something you sort of expect from Hitchcock but this is certainly the most different I have seen of his films. It is part drama and part romance with some moments of tension. As much as I hate to say anything bad about Hollywood legends like Hitchcock and Cary Grant...the film's pacing felt off at times. It dragged a lot in the middle and I was waiting for more of the story to unfold. Considering the premise of the film the characters are very well developed, especially Grant. There is a back story behind his characters that comes out a little bit at a time and we grow to really like his rehabilitated thief. The brilliant cinematography and well written characters make it a very good watch.Cary Grant is as suave, handsome and cool as his reputation states him to be. I couldn't get over how much George Clooney looks like Grant (just a side note.) His character as John Robie is very well done and fascinating. Grant plays part detective, part reformed thief and part lover and does all three flawlessly. You cannot deny his charisma on screen. Grace Kelly is beautiful. I know I'm stating the obvious but this is the first time I've really noticed her in a film and only the second film of hers I've seen (the first being Rear Window.) Kelly and Grant together are electric. Kelly's character starts as very plain and nearly boring and I thought that this was just another stereotypical snobby upper class girl that falls in love with a low-class thief. I was very wrong. Kelly's character ends up having more depth and some clever turns to her personality and she really pulls it off. Jessie Royce Landis was near brilliant in my books. She only had a few scenes but she easily carried every scene she was in. The banter between her and Grant was just perfect and she was so great in every scene she was in. John Williams and Charles Vanel round out the main supporting cast in solid performances though neither really stand out against the main cast. Brigitte Auber was very good in her role as the young, naive Danielle who clearly has a sordid past with Grant's Robie. I actually would have liked to have seen more of her and find out more about their past.As with any good Hitchcock film there is a twist. However, it is a weak twist in my book and I had it almost positively figured out very early on. I am not one to figure things out quickly so I am disappointed when a film blatantly makes the twist obvious. Alfred Hitchcock is a legend and every film I have seen of his thus far has featured very dark undertones, a thriller\/horror feel and this one was completely different. It was almost a drama with just a touch of mystery. But there is no doubt that his direction is brilliant. As I mentioned, the setting and cinematography is so well done and the film is so well shot. Its a feast of for the eyes when it comes to traditional visuals. While it is not one of his best, I was glad to see it. It absolutely has that genuine timeless classic feel and I am officially a Cary Grant fan and officially have a classic crush on the stunning Grace Kelly. A fun, Sunday afternoon flick that everyone can enjoy. Just don't expect it to be Hitchcock's best and I would hazard to guess it isn't Grant's best either. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 July 2013","score":"","review":" This marked the first time I have seen a Cary Grant film.

Alfred Hitchcock is a legend and every film I have seen of his thus far has featured very dark undertones, a thriller\/horror feel and this one was completely different.

It absolutely has that genuine timeless classic feel and I am officially a Cary Grant fan and officially have a classic crush on the stunning Grace Kelly.

This is a remarkable confession for a movie guy like myself. The film was great. It is clearly a classic but it also has its faults. It doesn't necessarily feel dated, in fact it holds up pretty well comparatively to other classics in the same vein. The French countryside is stunning and beautiful and a near perfect setting for the film. It certainly presents itself as thriller, its something you sort of expect from Hitchcock but this is certainly the most different I have seen of his films. It is part drama and part romance with some moments of tension. As much as I hate to say anything bad about Hollywood legends like Hitchcock and Cary Grant...the film's pacing felt off at times. It dragged a lot in the middle and I was waiting for more of the story to unfold. Considering the premise of the film the characters are very well developed, especially Grant. There is a back story behind his characters that comes out a little bit at a time and we grow to really like his rehabilitated thief. The brilliant cinematography and well written characters make it a very good watch.Cary Grant is as suave, handsome and cool as his reputation states him to be. I couldn't get over how much George Clooney looks like Grant (just a side note.) His character as John Robie is very well done and fascinating. Grant plays part detective, part reformed thief and part lover and does all three flawlessly. You cannot deny his charisma on screen. Grace Kelly is beautiful. I know I'm stating the obvious but this is the first time I've really noticed her in a film and only the second film of hers I've seen (the first being Rear Window.) Kelly and Grant together are electric. Kelly's character starts as very plain and nearly boring and I thought that this was just another stereotypical snobby upper class girl that falls in love with a low-class thief. I was very wrong. Kelly's character ends up having more depth and some clever turns to her personality and she really pulls it off. Jessie Royce Landis was near brilliant in my books. She only had a few scenes but she easily carried every scene she was in. The banter between her and Grant was just perfect and she was so great in every scene she was in. John Williams and Charles Vanel round out the main supporting cast in solid performances though neither really stand out against the main cast. Brigitte Auber was very good in her role as the young, naive Danielle who clearly has a sordid past with Grant's Robie. I actually would have liked to have seen more of her and find out more about their past.As with any good Hitchcock film there is a twist.

As a matter of fact, this is the most recent movie I've ever seen. I watched it because I am interested in the history of the space program, was a space junkie when I was a kid, and am old enough to vividly recall the entire event of Apollo 13. I am not familiar with the actors in the film, who, from reading other reviews, are big names to movie fans. So I come to the film uninfluenced by my like or dislike of the actors, which often distorts one's view of a film, and I watched it mainly to see how right they got it.I think they mostly got it right. Visually, the film is beautiful. Having lived through the time myself, I think they got the look of the period perfectly. This isn't always easy to do, and the filmmakers should be credited with their dedication to accuracy. Hollywood hasn't always been so vigilant, even on such relatively recent events. One need only watch a 1940's film depicting the 1920's, to see how the filmmakers feel the need to modernize styles, not trusting the audience to get it, that it's a period piece. Cars, furniture, houses, clothes, hair styles, everything looks right in this picture. If you have a disposition towards accuracy, the research needn't be that deep&#x97;just dig up a 1970 Sears Catalog; but even this effort often seems too much for Hollywood.Same with all the rocket stuff. I'm not an engineer or scientist, but I have a fair layman's knowledge of the Apollo gear, from 40+ years of interest in the subject, and I didn't notice any glaring mistakes. I'm sure there were some, but you'd have to be annoyingly obsessive to be offended by, or to even notice, them.A couple of things bugged me, striking me as hokey. First, was the argument between Haise & Swigert in the LEM. I guess this was added to create dramatic tension. I suppose you need this to make it a story instead of a documentary, but it is simply not credible. Second was the part at the end when TK Mattingly takes over as CapCom during the reentry. This scene smacked of old time Hollywood bathos, and I wasn't buying it. Third, making Grumman the goat in a couple of scenes where an unnamed Grumman executive is depicted as being hesitant, obstructive and noncommittal. I guess every movie needs a villain and it's easy to pick a now non-existent corporate entity to be the villain in a film where everybody else bonds together in a spirit of cooperation, but it's a libel on the company that, after all, built the spacecraft that saved the crew's lives.The acting was good, but the writing was often clichéd. A lot of it reminded me of things like Back To Bataan or the Sands of Iwo Jima, only moving the scene from the beachheads of World War II to the vacuum of outer space. Watching the film, I got the feeling the actors looked a little too young for the parts they were playing, especially the guy who played Jack Swigert. Swigert was a tough, hard looking guy, while the actor portraying him looked almost adolescent. The actor playing Lovell did a good job in playing A part, but he didn't come across to me as Jim Lovell, whose public persona I've been familiar with since I was in the first grade. Lovell always came across as one of the more glib and well spoken of the astronauts, with a strong sense of humor, and we don't sense this in the film. I think ii's more a product of the writing than the acting, but the Lovell character in the film seems more like a generic movie action hero than the real life Jim Lovell. This, I think, is the main shortcoming of the film, that the crew members, Lovell, Swigert, Haise & Mattingly, seem like 4 interchangeable guys, rather than distinct personalities. Again, I feel the fault is in the writing, not the acting.A couple of the characters are never really named in the film (that I noticed) but it's obvious who they were supposed to be&#x97;mainly Sy Liebergot and John Aaron. I don't necessarily think an actor in a film needs to look exactly like the historical figure he's portraying, but the actor playing Liebergot looked nothing like the real Liebergot. I did find it interesting that the actor playing the unnamed CapCom through most of the film looked a whole lot like John Young. I wondered if this was done on purpose, because in the photos and films of the actual event, Young is often seen around the CapCom desk, though he never was CapCom on this flight. This didn't bug me, but it was interesting. (Also, the other CapCom in the film strongly resembled Stuart Roosa, Apollo 14 Command Module pilot, and I wondered if this, too, was intentional. Like Young, Roosa was never a CapCom on this flight.)But for all the complaints, I did like the film. You have to expect a certain level of hokeyness when Hollywood tackles a serious subject. There's a happy ending when the astronauts return safely, and an even happier ending for Mattingly (in real life, not the film) when he was assigned to Apollo 16, a much longer, more interesting, mission, in which he got to do his own EVA, a deep flight space walk, which he would not have done had he not been booted from 13. Hopefully some of the folks seeing this film will be interested enough to read up on the subject, and then look at other missions of the Apollo (and Mercury and Gemini) programs, because it's all fascinating stuff.

It doesn't exactly have the most coherent story, but the Death Wish style premise is easy enough to understand. Where it truly succeeds is in creating some memorably vicious and amazingly trashy moments. As a snapshot of the very seedy side of NYC at the time, it's aces. Some viewers will appreciate the combination of action, stunts, and sleaze; there's always another nasty surprise around the corner.Robert Ginty has the title role (otherwise known as John Eastland), a Vietnam veteran whose life is saved more than once by good friend Michael Jefferson (the charismatic Steve James, in a part you wish was bigger). Michael, unfortunately, is targeted by degenerate street punks back in NYC; he is mugged and paralyzed. John, knowing he owes his friend, tracks the punks down and gives them what they deserve. But he doesn't stop there. Incensed at the various kinds of crime in The City, he becomes a flamethrower wielding vigilante, soon pursued by amiable detective James Dalton (Christopher George).The entertainment value here, of course, lies in that vicarious pleasure we so often experience watching somebody, whether fictional or real, fight back against the criminal scum that try to make our lives miserable. Whether we're dealing with the punks, a loathsome chicken pimp (a creep who specializes in procuring boys for perverts, played by Tony Di Benedetto), or big shot mobsters such as Gino Pontivini (Dick Boccelli), the bad guys are so bad you wait eagerly to see them punished. The wildest scene has a guy fed into a meat grinder, although people also get set on fire and shot in the crotch with poisoned bullets. These moments are what make this such a trashy fun experience, although it does waste some time giving the detective character a love interest, a doctor played by Samantha Eggar. One good thing is that the movie literally begins with a bang, giving us a nightmarish Vietnam sequence that features what is one of the best cinematic decapitations of all time, thanks to Tom Burman and Stan Winston.George as always has an engaging presence, and Eggar is endearing as his new lady friend. Ginty does what he has to do well enough; buffs will note the presence of a number of character faces - David Lipman, Dennis Boutsikaris, George Cheung, Ned Eisenberg, Irwin Keyes, Lou David, Tom Everett - among the cast. Apparently Samuel L. Jackson was also an extra somewhere in here!Amazing aerial shots of NYC, excellent music by Joe Renzetti, and some poignant songs over the opening and ending credits also help.If you love other urban B pictures from this period (William Lustigs' Vigilante is another good one), then this one is pretty much mandatory viewing.Seven out of 10.

The movie doesn't do a very well job in incorporating Bedrock and its world into the story or the viewing of the movie as it attempts to expand on the original cartoon without having all too much creativity, BUUUUT, it's still very good, and it's still a very lovely family adventure. I love the Flintstones movie. The Flintstones is amusingly funny all the way through with a likable story and a friendly disposition. The Flintstones has pleasant visuals; it has greatly glamorous sets as it is wondrously colorful. The interactive Bedrock environments are really solid. The cast is full of chiseled actors, well....okay, it's a really good cast. John Goodman plays a great Fred Flintstone. Goodman and Elizabeth Perkins are both fine as Fred and Wilma Flintstone. Rick Moranis is really good in a poorly written Barney Rubble character, and Rosie O'Donnell is pissy and not good as she struggles in what's supposed to be a sweet Betty Rubble character. This is a likable Kyle MacLachlan role as he's good in a consistently well-written villain character, but I have yet to ever take notice of MacLachlan while I am watching the Flintstones. Holy smokes! Hello, Halle Berry! My goodness! You're scorchingly beautiful! Wow! Miss Halle Berry as Miss Stone is smoking hot! My God! Look at her! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is so rocking hot beyond belief! Bamm-Bamm! The hottest girl in history! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is melting me with her fire! Oh my! Sweet Halle! Halle as Miss Stone gives one of the sexiest flirtatious jobs I've ever seen! Yabba dabba do! Halle Berry is unbelievable as she gives an all-time lovely performance. The Flintstones serves as a launching pad to Halle's destined superstardom. Berry blatantly owns this movie from beginning to end, and Halle is so clearly the great standout star of The Flintstones, not so much in an 'everybody else is bad she's so great' kind of a way but more so in an 'everybody's so good oh she's so very good' kind of way. Berry's amazing. It's more than just my imagination, Berry's scenes are just better; maybe it's her performance, maybe it's her bodacious body in that dress. Her scenes were meant to serve as a sweet getaway so that the audience could get lost in Halle's gorgeous eyes, and her freakishly fine physique for some time, but they actually serve as critical plot points. Halle has all the best parts. Miss Stone is a respectable and an elegant written character. Stone is the heroine of The Flintstones, and Halle's the heroine of my heart. I love Halle so. The lovely Elizabeth Taylor appears in her farewell performance and she's...so lovely. She's too great a choice to play Fred's mother-in-law; I'm grateful Taylor decided to do the role. Elizabeth brings real life to the character. The Flintstones is a gay old time.

But just like every other successful person, they had to start somewhere. Parker and Stone started their careers by creating low budget comedy movies. The first full-length movie they created was the 1993 black comedy named Cannibal! The Musical aka Alferd Packer The Musical and then, several years after, in 1997, they finished the interestingly named comedy Orgazmo. Orgazmo, while not being a particularly good movie, is a good early example of Parker and Stone's distinguished sense of humour.Orgazmo is about a young Mormon named Joe Young (Trey Parker) who is in a happy relationship with his fiancée Lisa. They plan on getting wedded in some church or something, but unfortunately they have no money to do so. However, Joe, for no apparent reason, has extremely good fighting skills, which come in handy when a porn director named Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs) sees him beating up a couple of guys and decides to hire him in his newest porn\/super-hero movie. Joe reluctantly accepts, but says he will only do the actual acting, none of the intercourse. They agree on using a 'stunt cock' to film all his sex scenes. And so Joe finds himself playing the title role of Orbinson's newest movie &#x96; Orgazmo.The premise of the movie is very silly and very 'South Park-esque', if I may add. But what works in animation, doesn't necessarily work in non-animated movies &#x96; especially when it comes to humour. And the humour in Orgazmo is very versatile &#x96; there's toilet humour, there's spoof humour, there's self-parodying (the movie deliberately looks bad from time to time) and there's original jokes. When a movie has so many different types of humour in it, it's hard to enjoy every one of them. The toilet humour is the one that bothered me the most and I found those jokes to be the least funny ones. Apart from that, I did laugh quite a few times.The acting in Orgazmo is classic 'low budget-trashy' and it doesn't want to be anything more. However, the interesting thing is that a big number of actors starring in Orgazmo are actual porn stars &#x96; the most prominent being Ron Jeremy and Chasey Lain. All in all, Orgazmo is just another trash movie that may be fun but truly isn't anything special. If you are a die hard fan of South Park\/Trey Parker\/Matt Stone, do check out this early creation, you'll probably be pleasantly surprised. As for the rest of you, the only thing that will quite possibly entertain you is Orgazmo's goofy title.Rating 6\/10 Read more at http\/\/passpopcorn.wordpress.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"8 July 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" If you're even remotely interested in either comedy, animation or TV-shows, you must have heard of Trey Parker and Matt Stone &#x96; the genius creators of the famous South Park.
