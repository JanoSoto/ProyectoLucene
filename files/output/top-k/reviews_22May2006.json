Adam Sandler looks like haute coture by comparison; South Park (the TV series) classic high comedy. Evidently, the filmmakers here lack the ability to be clever without being so excessively edgy that you would never want to watch it with your kids at any age - unless you're the type of parent that thinks you should look the other way when they get into your stash and that it's just fine when your 15-year-old gets pregnant. It is most definitely NOT good fun as some have phrased it; CADDDYSHACK was good fun, ANIMAL HOUSE was good fun, but this is is so far over the top it is just trash. I notice in the IMDb bio of Jim Carrey that he has one daughter; I wonder how he felt about the idea of her seeing this thing when it premiered? (Then again, according to the bio he was married and divorced three times before the age of 36 - chances are he doesn't know which way is up, anyway.) Seriously, it is a perfect example of how pop culture has gone completely into the toilet over the past generation, with nothing but increasingly rancid manifestations to be expected in the foreseeable future.

It is a real shame because Renee Zellweger is one of my favorites and Carrey is certainly capable of better. It is a worse shame that stars of this magnitude of both popularity and talent serve to elevate this garbage to the level of mainstream entertainment.

This is, by far, one of my favorite films to date. This initially appears to be a somewhat light film about 2 modern day characters ( Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) that have a run-in with Don Knotts as a T.V. repairmen. The outcome of which ends them both in the T.V. show of Pleasantville. A place where the temperature is always 72 degrees, the sun always shines, and everything is in black and white, and ...pleasant.After the initial shock wears off, both characters discover how 2-dimensional the characters in Pleasantville are. They find themselves as the main characters in a 50's T.V. show as children of George and Betty Parker. The actors in this film do a phenomenal job portraying a life devoid of passion. They find that all of the characters go about life in a mechanical fashion, without any knowledge of lust, hope, grief, or anger.Reese's character (Jennifer) quickly turns to her old ways, and promptly takes her 'boyfriend' (Paul Walker of The Fast and the Furious fame) to lovers lane. She shows him the joys of sex, at which point, the exodus from Eden begins. Shortly after Paul drops Reese off at home, he sees a single red rose. By red, I mean this is the only non black and white thing in Pleasantville. From here on the movie reaches out and grabs you. It turns into a cascading affect of self discovery, both good and bad for the citizens of Smallville. Initially all of the high school kids enter onto this path, as glimpses here and there of pink bubble gum, neon signs at the local hang out\/diner, rose red lips, and curiosity about the previously unknown world outside of Pleasantville. The Diner and Lovers lane become a place of color in a black and white world with many allegories to The Garden of Eden.They discover things like love, lust, wonder about the world around them. This is where I disagree with many of the reviews here. This is a movie about passion. You have to look beyond the first and most obvious things that curious teenagers do. The changes in the children begin to happen with the parents. Suddenly dinner isn't cooked and ready at 6. A wife burns her husband's shirt with a iron because she was daydreaming. They see rain and rainbows in Technicolor for the first time, and a tree in front of the Parkers' household bursts into flame as the mother (Joan Allen) pleasures herself in the bathroom (with a little instruction from Reese Witherspoon on the facts of life). These scenes are all tastefully done.From here the film takes a turn into the darker side of human emotion. Soon, the 'coloreds' are drawing attention to the fact that things are changing in Pleasantville. Signs stating that no coloreds are allowed start appearing on Main Street while the coloreds continue to explore themselves and the world around them. Angry mobs begin to form, trying to stamp out any sign of change. As each person discovers passion in some form (whether hate, love, lust, bigotry, grief, regret), they turn into coloreds who then initially hide in the local soda shop, desperate to escape the angry mobs outside. A new city ordinance is passed declaring what music is acceptable, and what colors are safe (as long as they are a shade of gray).Jeff Daniels also shines here as the local Diner owner. He finds himself attracted to Miss Parker, who in turn finds herself drawn to him even though her character is 'happily' married. Daniels also finds he has a passion for art. He goes from a mechanical shop keeper to a person in love, who also stands defiant with Tobey Maguire in painting a naked mural showing Miss Parker. This sets off a riot, and ends with the Diner being trashed and a bonfire culminating in a book burning. Some of these moments have you sitting with a lump in our throat from the raw emotion the visuals and the music evoke from this film.Suffice it to say; this is one of the finest and most original films I've ever seen, and certainly not to be missed. For those that think this is an attack on moral values, you have missed the point. This is not about lust, or promiscuity. It simply shows that were are all human. We make mistakes. We love. We live. As a result, we have passions of which sometimes you cannot control.

This is, by far, one of my favorite films to date. This initially appears to be a somewhat light film about 2 modern day characters ( Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) that have a run-in with Don Knotts as a T.V. repairmen. The outcome of which ends them both in the T.V. show of Pleasantville. A place where the temperature is always 72 degrees, the sun always shines, and everything is in black and white, and ...pleasant.After the initial shock wears off, both characters discover how 2-dimensional the characters in Pleasantville are. They find themselves as the main characters in a 50's T.V. show as children of George and Betty Parker. The actors in this film do a phenomenal job portraying a life devoid of passion. They find that all of the characters go about life in a mechanical fashion, without any knowledge of lust, hope, grief, or anger.Reese's character (Jennifer) quickly turns to her old ways, and promptly takes her 'boyfriend' (Paul Walker of The Fast and the Furious fame) to lovers lane. She shows him the joys of sex, at which point, the exodus from Eden begins. Shortly after Paul drops Reese off at home, he sees a single red rose. By red, I mean this is the only non black and white thing in Pleasantville. From here on the movie reaches out and grabs you. It turns into a cascading affect of self discovery, both good and bad for the citizens of Smallville.

It's kind of like smelling something that you haven't in a long time and all those feelings that you had the first time you experienced it come flooding back.For me, I was twelve years old when I first saw this movie. It was on a rainy summer Saturday afternoon with my best friend Dean (we had nothing better to do...). The film was both funny and seriously awe-inspiring at the same time. As we walked out of the theater, Dean and I looked at each other and exclaimed at the same time, I can do that! When I got home from the movie, I immediately went to work lobbying my brothers and pestering my parents to get us (me) a bike. Between all of us, we finally came to an agreement with us boys finding a way to finance most of it (our dad flitting the bill for the rest) and mom consenting to let us anywhere near the thing in the first place (lots of promises were made that day I can tell you).That first bike was a Bultaco Sherpa some 3 or four years old. It was set up as a trails bike and all of us boys, our friends (until they talked their parents into one), and even a sister or two took many turns over the next few trying to figure out how to negotiate a 30 inch diameter log that lay across the creek...without putting our feet down (a la Malcolm Smith in the movie of course)! Many of us, some 35 years later, still wear faded scars that mark these great, but dangerous, days.This movie got me started loving something that I didn't even really think about existing until then. We had mainly bicycles and horses where I grew up. A friend down the rode apiece did have a mini-bike with a 5 hp Briggs and Stratton powering it, but it was touchy and didn't always start when you wanted it too (although, I can also say this about the Sherpa at times).This was really the first time that I started to learn about motors...what it was like to get greasy-dirty...the smell of gasoline and oil...and what it took to get both yourself and the bike clean again (to Mom's satisfaction).My love of motorcycles began on that wet summer day and has continued to the present.

I don't like giving spoilers so I'll just put out some points so you can decide whether or not to rent\/buy this If you like Billy Crystal as a comedian, then you will love this movie. He makes his signature subtle, pessimistic jokes throughout the movie.Meg Ryan is also great. Although her character develops from a snobby, sheltered young woman to a mature, open-minded woman, she maintains this innocence that makes this fun to watch because you get to kind of feel what she feels -- she speaks what comes to mind, and you see her emotions all over her face. It kind of reminds me of her role in Sleepless in Seattle and her other earlier roles.Together, Billy and Meg have this great chemistry on screen, and this makes the movie feel like you're watching a real story. The way the relationship develops is probably the most interesting thing, so even if you know what happens, you will enjoy watching it happen. If you don't know what happens, it's a perfect feel-good movie with a happy ending, but it's not easy to predict how it gets to the happy ending.Overall, this movie is a great choice if you're looking for something uplifting, romantic, and funny but also realistic and not too mushy.

At that time my first thought was that it was about some horror movie slasher film in a corn field due to the dark movie cover and the cold looking man on the cover. Although the cover has changed since then I was only surprised to learn that it was about a baseball player later on in my life around the age of 15. However it was about a cold looking, and not to mention cruel acting man. It was almost scary the way this man viewed life. Almost abusively portrayed through the incredible skill of Tommy Lee Jones. No one could have possibly played this role with enough conviction and energy as the man they cast. He was vigorous, violent, and energetic and in every way fit for this part. I disagree with another commentators comment that Robert Wuhl's character was dry and lacking. In that I also say that I saw much more in that character than most people give him credit for. This film carry's you from a wretched, sick old man in the boondocks to a wild, wary, warrior of life fighting and dominating every aspect of life that he cared to pursue. Tommy lee Jones did an incredible job at playing a hated, yet respected character in that stone cold role of Tyrus Raymond Cobb. I found this film most moving, and although at times I could not believe the wake left in his trail I had to tip my hat to a man who kept fighting right up to the last minute of his life. I later read the biography Cobba biography by Al Stump and reading of his wild nature in that book I knew that the role had been attacked with a savage ferocity. No matter who you are don't look at this film as something to criticize, but more as something to educate yourself on a man who never gave up, and lived his life without ever giving inch without fighting for it. He set records and he turned some heads in the process.Go into this movie with an open perspective instead of the love hate attitude that most have for films. For if a film was about you loving or hating a character or a part of a movie you might miss the whole point of the film. The point of this film clearly established that he was hated, and he owed that to no one other than himself. I was moved, wowed, amazed, and shaken by this film simply from the acting alone. it's worth watching at least once. and lastly i must say comparing this to the real story that this movie was as close to the truth of any portrayal of any life as any i have seen. ***1\/2 out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"22 May 2006","score":"11 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":" when was in a movie rental store around the age of 8 I had no idea what in the world a movie titled Cobb could possibly be about.
