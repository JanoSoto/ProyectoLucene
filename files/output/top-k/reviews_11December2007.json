Discovered by Sam Phillips, the man who discovered Elvis and Johnny Cash, Lewis came up the ranks quickly and was poised to become the King of Rock 'n' Roll when Elvis went into the Army. But the scandal that broke when it was revealed he was married to his 13-year-old cousin Myra (Winona Ryder) and was in fact a bigamist - which today would be shrugged off - just about ruined his career. Soon he was prone to violence on and off stage and imbibing in alcohol.I have always loved Jerry Lee Lewis' music, but the only thing I knew about him was that he married his cousin - so that will show you where all the publicity was focused. I had no idea that Jimmy Swaggert (played here by Alec Baldwin) was also his cousin. I was struck by the qualities he had in common with Elvis - they both were highly-charged performers with so much energy a stage couldn't hold them, both completely original, natural talents inspired by music they heard in their communities, and both were discovered by Sam Phillips. What each one was most of all was just like one of the kids that he sang to, who could pulsate, dance and let their hormones run wild with the music. Lewis remains today an electrifying performer with an unmistakable sound. His high gear Great Balls of Fire, Breathless, High School Confidential, and of course, Whole Lotta Shaking' Going' On are unmatched.Now, how accurate was this film? Jerry Lee himself claims he never acted the way Dennis Quaid portrayed him in his life, though others say Quaid was right on. It's a little like Scottish people hearing a Scottish burr on an actor and saying, we don't talk like that when they do. I will quibble with the depiction of Sam Phillips as a snake oil salesman who, according to this script, lost Elvis. Phillips didn't lose Elvis - his record company was too small to promote Elvis as he needed to be promoted, and Phillips badly needed the money Elvis' contract would bring. Elvis, Vernon and Gladys Presley thought they had it good - no one dreamed Elvis could accomplish what he did - so Sam Phillips could have kept Elvis with Sun for a longer period of time, but rather than stifling Presley's career, he let him go.Quaid does an excellent job as a thrilling performer who perhaps isn't the most likable person off stage - in fact, might be a little sleazy - and Ryder captures the teenage silliness beautifully. Baldwin doesn't get to do much but proselytize.The most interesting thing about Great Balls of Fire is its relevance today. Rock 'n' Roll was perceived as the way to complete degradation for teenagers and the performers were servants of the devil. Rap music is viewed the same way today. With rock 'n' roll, the road to degradation was a sexual one - swinging those hips and getting all charged up could only mean trouble. Today, with rap, it's the message of violence against women and attitudes towards them, the use of violence and foul language. In between, we had the schools ruling that no one could have a Beatles haircut. Maybe someday it will occur to somebody that many things can destroy a generation - war and drugs being two - but music doesn't seem to be one of them.

Hailed as one of the great screwball comedies and on many best lists, I just didn't think it was as strong a picture as I was expecting. When I think of 'screwball', I'm looking for snappy one liners and engaging chemistry between the principals, but the film didn't deliver for me on that score. Gable's character came off as rather harsh for my taste, especially in the scene at the cabin when they faked their marriage to convince the authorities that Ellie (Claudette Colbert) wasn't the person they were looking for. There was also that set up at the beginning of the relationship when Peter Warne (Gable) has the 'so there' tiff with the bus driver. I was really expecting a clever resolution to that exchange and it just went nowhere.So OK, the picture swept the Oscars, but take a look at one of the competitors - The Thin Man. Now there was a screwball comedy, with as engaging a couple as you can find in William Powell and Myrna Loy. What was probably needed here was someone like Cary Grant to pull off the male lead, as Gable's approach was just a bit too shrill. In fact, Grant was a newspaper reporter in His Girl Friday, opposite Rosalind Russell, so there's another example. Another would be Philadelphia Story, Grant again with a little help from Jimmy Stewart. The latter two came a half dozen years later, but you still get the idea.As for director Capra, I think he outdid this picture with his 1938 Best Film Oscar winner - You Can't Take It With You, and you can't get any more screwball than that one. And even though the theme is somewhat different, It's A Wonderful Life stands head and shoulders above this one in my estimation. So maybe I'm missing something, and I'll leave it at that.There were a few things that caught my attention though, like 'Hot Dogs and Hamburgers - 10 cents' on one of the roadside bus stops - there's a bargain! And I had never seen an 'autogyro' before, I thought it would be a helicopter, but seeing it with two propellers going in different directions was really cool to see.But then you had Gable smoking in bed a couple of times. Not a very good example to set when so many people lose their lives in house fires from that very cause. And who thought it was cool for him to beat up a guy to steal his car? Sorry for those downers. But the thing that nagged me the most - what did Ellie Andrews ever see in King Westley to begin with?

The Family Man has killed eight families in six months & Campbell & Cole are told that he has struck again, two people in a seedy motel room bear all the hallmarks of the serial killer but super cop Cole knows that something is not right. As Campbell & Cole investigate the killings they find themselves under threat from from the Russian mafia, hit-men & the all round general scum of Los Angeles as they stumble across a plot in import chemical weapon's into the states...Directed by John Gray one has to say that I like a good over-the-top Steven Seagal action flick, unfortunately The Glimmer Man is nothing like a good over-the-top Steven Seagal action flick. The script by Kevin Brodbin takes itself very seriously & one feels it tries to marry a dark serial killer thriller storyline not too dissimilar to the excellent Se7en (1995) which was a big box-office success the previous year together with the brutal violent action & martial arts of some of Seagal's previous better films like Out for Justice (1992), Under Siege (1992) it's sequel Under Siege 2 Dark Territory (1995) in particular which is an uneasy combination The Glimmer Man fails at spectacularly. The serial killer plot is there just for the hell of it & is totally abandoned by the halfway mark in favour of a buddy buddy mismatched partner cop action thriller like Lethal Weapon (1987), in fact The Glimmer Man feels like little bits & pieces, themes & ideas from various similar (much better) films all strung together in a rather lazy, routine & predictable narrative. As usual for Seagal there are some unintentionally funny scenes here the best being when Seagal's character is talking to a pathologist discussing a dead woman's body & Seagal proceeds to pick up a nearby scalpel, slice open the corpses breast & pull out a silicon implant so they can check the serial number on it! Yes, the scene really is as daft, dumb & silly as it sounds & that's not the only one. For instance when Campbell is hanging from the hotel window ledge at the end where did Seagal suddenly find all that professional abseiling gear to rescue him with?Director Gray has to take a large chunk of responsibility here, the film drags badly especially at the start & it's surprisingly boring despite a few reasonable fight scenes. This is filmed in a functional if forgettable way & the constant gloomy whether & rain pouring from the sky is a direct & obvious rip-off from Se7en only it doesn't work here. In The Glimmer Man you can really see Seagal starting to put some weight on after having a string of financially successful flicks, maybe he became too complacent but as far as most people are concerned your only as good as your last film & it's this point Seagal's career took a nose-dive into the crapper to the point where he's staring these days in low budget action films opposite has-been rappers in Eastern Europeon countries. There are some trademark violent action scenes with Seagal slicing bad guy's throats with razor blades hidden in credit cards, breaking arms, shooting people to gain information, throwing them into steel posts, & generally causing lots of people lots of pain in a variety of entertaining ways. Unfortunately those scenes don't stop The Glimmer Man from being crap. There's an OK car crash sequence as a car crashes into a gas tanker conveniently parked diagonally across a road but a bit more could have been done with it & doesn't linger in the memory that long.With a supposed budget of about $45,000,000 The Glimmer Man opened with under $8,000,000 & to very bad reviews. While I don't think The Glimmer Man lost much money I doubt it made much for Warner Bros. either which is why they probably went off Seagal a bit & only made two more films with him each one decreasing in budget. I have to mention Seagal's coat & Buddhist bead necklace here, it's awful & worth a few laughs all on it's own. I suspect Keenan Ivory Wayans was maybe trying to imitate his brother Damon Wayans who starred in a similar sort of action flick The Last Boy Scout (1991) along side Bruce Willis, the only difference being The Last Boy Scout is a terrific action film & The Glimmer Man isn't. As usual Seagal mumbles his way through the film & has become pretty lazy during the fight scenes not really moving or seemingly putting much effort into them.The Glimmer Man is terrible, apart from one or two half decent & violent fight scenes this is just a jumbled mess of ideas stolen from better films.

I'll lay it all out first by echoing the comments of my girlfriend and fellow viewer when she said this is the most ridiculous film I've ever seen.She said this shortly after a cat fight where endless breasts tumble of dresses and after yet another violent exchange and what she said did have an element of truth to it.

However, I can (and will) also say these as things that make the film worth watching but most of these are essentially what the blaxploitation genre did at its cheesiest. Looking at it that way, the film is actually pretty good within the genre because the plot and deliver holds it mostly together and, surprisingly, it never felt cheap or tacky even when it was being trashy.

That experience has since instilled a strong sense of compassion and patience in me despite the most degrading treatment shown to me at the hands of those I've attempted to help, but if it has taught me anything in my quest as a writer, it is that you must never judge the characters you encounter or create if you want to do justice to them or make them whole, and that is exactly how I feel about the characters portrayed in Lee Tamahori's Once Were Warriors. Despite the intense violence this film depicts I all at once connected to its story and characters as if they were extensions of my own self. Tamahori presents an emotional epic that is brutal yet honest and spares us from unnecessary romantics.Through the magnificent performances of its epic cast not only does it illustrate the complexities of passion and love, but also of forgiveness and redemption for oneself and others through utter and complete humanity and three dimensional characters. Jake Heke is all at once the violent antagonist as he is the misguided child who desperately searches for love and affection the only way he knows how, through violence and the gang ethic he has instilled in him. If you know what it's like to really be alone and to grasp at straws in a vain effort to protect yourself from it you won't hate him despite the most deplorable actions he undertakes. This film carries a strong and powerful message about inner strength, the power of heritage and history, and its capacity to mold human ambition and character through acceptance and admiration versus shame and suffering.

We also see overall tension rising between officials of the media, the African-American community, and the overall population--and as we all are well aware, it does not necessarily yield positive results. Overall, Spike Lee's Bamboozled addresses a series of issues including the influence from media, racial profiling\/discrimination, corruption, etc., and also alludes to the conflicts of the past regarding the origins of the black face as well as racism itself. This film is incredibly loaded and I feel it takes one with substantial passion and intelligence to organize and create a story as powerful as Spike Lee's. I truly commend Lee's work!

The Baker Boys have been playing dual pianos on the lounge circuit for years, with Frank (Beau) acting as the booking manager and accountant. When the bookings dry up, the brothers decide to hire a singer. She's Susie Diamond, a gorgeous blond with a sultry voice and sexy appearance that gives the Baker Boys the pizazz that they need to pick up better gigs and more of them. Of course, one can't wait for the handsome, quietly intense Jack (Jeff) and Susie to give into their sexual chemistry, despite Frank's warnings that Jack's hit and run technique will not work with a teammate. When Frank is called away on a family emergency, more than sex happens. Ultimately Susie's bluntness and ability to see a situation for what it is makes Jack realize he hates the act, hates the way his brother handles it, and hates himself for not pursuing work as a jazz musician.Someone wrote that the plot is thin - not really. The sibling dynamics are real, pent up, and the product of years of lip-biting, Jack becoming more and more introverted and Frank more desperate to work so he can support his family. It takes an outsider to bring tempers to a boil.The film is very well done, with great music throughout, including some very hot singing by Pfeiffer. The highlight of the movie is Pfeiffer rolling around on the piano as she sings to Jack. She's really at the height of her beauty and can compare favorably to any Hollywood goddess of the past. Her performance as a street-wise singer who's had it tough is excellent, right down to the chewing gum and the crystal jewelry. Beau Bridges is perfectly cast. He plays a working musician for whom music is a job - and yet he's proud of the act, insistent on having Feelings in every show they do, and likes songs like Bali Hai. Then we come to Jeff Bridges, certainly one of the sexiest men to ever come down the pike - tall and handsome, he is the essence of true jazz musician here - passionate on the piano, cool, loving the night life and the attendant bad habits of drinking and smoking. He's all tied up in his inability to break free of his brother, and it's expressed in every non-expression, every puff of his cigarette. He's fantastic.Another reviewer on this site stated that non-musicians probably can't understand Jack's frustration about the music. It's true, I'm a trained musician and related to his crisis immediately. But I think many people are in jobs they don't like, many people have a book they never finished because the kids came along - I think this is a very appealing story.I remember this film getting a big build-up when it was released, but many people on IMDb feel it's underrated. I didn't realize it was, but if it is, it shouldn't be. What a movie - a strange kind of a love story for sure, between a man and his music, but a love story nevertheless.

But I think many people are in jobs they don't like, many people have a book they never finished because the kids came along - I think this is a very appealing story.I remember this film getting a big build-up when it was released, but many people on IMDb feel it's underrated. I didn't realize it was, but if it is, it shouldn't be. What a movie - a strange kind of a love story for sure, between a man and his music, but a love story nevertheless.

However, re-watching it, this is a heavy handed kids movie with too many slow moments and animation too loose for it's own good.Ferngully tells the story of a rain forest full of sprite like creatures. Their habitat is being destroyed by man, who don't know how much harm they're causing. The villain in the film is Hexxus, a glob of goo who grows larger and larger and thrives off of waste. Tim Curry's performance as this very strange character is what makes the movie. Robin Williams has a real throwaway role as the comic relief bat, aptly named Batty. Though he is a comic relief character he's also there to be preachy, and was previously tested on by humans. Everything in this movie gives a message, and as a child I did not care or understand what the point of this was. Now, I realize how preachy this really is, so it doesn't work on any level.In the end, this was a short, preachy movie, with some inspired moments....but mostly it was too heavy on it's environmental message.My rating ** out of ****. 71 mins.

I cannot describe the sensation that is being burnt alive; shot six times by a pistol; shot several times with various shotguns, pistols and an assault rifle simultaneously and I especially cannot describe what it is like falling through some sodden ground only to have a gravestone cave in on top of me. Maybe I cannot describe it because none of it really happened; after all &#150; the third Halloween film only included me as part of a television trailer thus disconnecting me from the 'real' world entirely poor shame.I can get away with anything, because I'm Michael Myers and I'm invincible. I've been shot and burnt and what have you loads of times but I keep coming back like the giant cockroach that won't die; I am invisible despite being the biggest person in the whole town; I am indestructible despite being a human being; I've been captured but then consequently escaped when I should have been victim of capital punishment long before I even got the chance to. Yes, I'm the thing that wouldn't die in the franchise that wouldn't die and isn't it grand? Rumours were back in the day that I was going to go up against Freddy Kruger in a spin off adventure of its own but that was shelved for fifteen years; Voorhees eventually got the role &#150; Pah! Nobody likes Friday the Thirteenth anyway! Especially the one that had him most recently in space.But I am adamant that I can get over it by reliving some of my finest work from yesteryear particularly in the form of Halloween 5 The Revenge of Mi...... Oh no, wait &#150; this one was just 'Halloween 5' with no subheading, how disappointing. This time, I am convinced that I am invincible as well as invisible with brainless logic forming the basis of this addition to my ever increasingly daft adventures. Evidence comes in the form of a dog barking at me loudly and yet nobody does or hears anything except for the owner who does or suspects nothing &#150; it's worth saying here that it is Halloween eve in Haddonfield and it's only been a year since I was at large and the owner WAS warned on the phone &#150; silly girl. Another case of idiocy on the resident's part was when the police come round to check; they leave after thinking it was a false alarm involving the dog but I'm smart I hide in the closet and wait for them to go but when the silly girl opens the door to get something out, she still doesn't see me &#150; unfortunately, she has since changed after finishing her shower.I'm Michael Myers and I'm invisible. I can stand amongst the bushes and stick out like a sore thumb but no one sees me. I am able to stand there and watch kids and their cars and partners mingle around a shop front they are more interested in sex and alcohol than they are in values; when I was their age, I was being treated at a hospital after what I did when I was very young but they don't know anything about that soon they will, though; soon they will. What I love about these kids is that I kill one of them and take his car &#150; his name is, unbelievably Michael. From here, I get to live out a fantasy I have never come within a light-year of ever experiencing. I drive to my new partner's house and pick her up; she dances for me showing me her Halloween costume thinking I'm Michael, which of course I am; she says my name in that wonderful voice she has and attempts conversation but I can't reply for two reasons it would give the game away and I'm stone cold with adrenaline. We drive for a while and she asks to stop by a petrol station but I drive straight past before screeching round and going back &#150; it would seem that a little girl whom I am related to has used her telepathic powers to tell the police where I am the 'living the dream' is over but it was worth it.It would seem that when I do come face to face with my relative, it is in an attic of my Myers house that wasn't actually there in any other of my adventures. It's equally convenient that the authorities and my doctor at the hospital never thought to check the house to see if that's where I was staying during this Halloween. After all, they didn't check the surrounding area after I escaped into the river at the very beginning; especially since I lodged up in a shack owned by an old man &#150; there I lay; for one year with no interference or anything like the old man reporting that he'd found me but how was I to know he'd keep quiet after I'd left? I wasn't, so I had to get rid of him of course. When it does come to the crunch; I delay over completing my goal in this edition as she lies there in my coffin bed &#150; I shed a tear but I don't know why; she escapes and gets the better of me in a laundry chute &#150; how careless of me this invisible, indestructible killing machine is beaten by an infant. I guess David and Goliath can happen after all. Then again, with my most recent adventure a replay of my first and set in an entirely different universe; I can forget all about this particular episode and re-focus on what I do best it's what you want and it's what I want.
