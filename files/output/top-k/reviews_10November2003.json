As first films go, Brosnan has an ease and a level of security here that works very well. You would never know watching it that this was his first Bond film, he is fantastic. It helps, though, that he is corresponded with a great supporting cast and a fantastic script that, despite a huge plot hole, works very well.The best part of the script is seeing how Bond is now interacting with the world now that not only the Cold War is over,  but that the world has gone and become a more politically correct one. His interaction with a modern Moneypenny a female M (who refers to him as a sexist misogynistic dinosaur) are all wonderfully done, but it is the more familiar Bond elements that make this the must see that it is. The far fetched plot, insane villain and two beautiful Bond girls all ensure a classic entrance for Brosnan and a brilliant reintroduction for the character.The plot is also quite strong as Bond deals with the death of a friend, only to learn that he has been betrayed. It all leads to a fantastic moment where 006, played with great aplomb by Sean Bean, is revealed to be the actual villain, having faked his death in the pre-title sequence. The scene features some wonderful music by Eric Serra and a wonderful scene where he reveals to Bond why he has done what he has done. The fantastic performances from Bean and Brosnan ensure that the film has a wonderful dynamic for hero and villain to play against. Trevelyn is not just another super villain looking to destroy the world, although that is something he is wanting to do, of course, but the fact that Bond is fighting against a man he believed to be his friend gives the film a mighty emotional punch, especially in the final moments that mark it out as something else. Add to this wonderful elements the shape of two beautiful Bond girls in the shape of Izabella Scoropco as Natalya Seminova and (my personal favorite) Famke Janssen as Xenia Onattop and some fantastic action sequences, such as the tank chase through St Petersburg and we have an all time classic Bond film, the beginning of a new era and one to rival the Connery dynasty.

Another gaffe, just as egregious and apparent but not nearly as commented on, is when Cary and Eva, clutching an incriminating statute, are rock-climbing around a quartet of famous presidential heads until a bad guy suddenly appears and leaps upon him. Whereupon the surprised, backward-falling Cary has the presence of mind to hand the statute to Eva, who takes his from him whilst in mid-scream. Do me a favor and read that last sentence again. What director today would allow such a scene past the editing room?But it just doesn't matter IMDB voters at this writing have placed the 44-year-old `North By Northwest' ahead of all but 18 movies ever made, including 14 which have nothing to do with Frodo Baggins or Darth Vader. That's pretty damn impressive. What the hell were they thinking? The only Hitchcock movie they rate higher is Rear Window; I can think of at least seven or eight Hitchcocks I'd rank over North By Northwest. None of them are Rear Window.The truth is this film is so popular because it is so good. Not great, but very, very good, in a way that anticipates a lot of the direction of mass entertainment to come and thus speaks to people in a way `Vertigo' or `Strangers On A Train' do not. People talk about how forward thinking Psycho is, and it is, but more directors took note of the just-as-clever-but-more-mainstream approach of North By Northwest. The last four decade have been chock full of flicks serving up suspense, sex, changing locales, and plot twists that play with viewers' expectations, all the while keeping the laughs coming. It's not like North By Northwest invented this formula, but it perfected and distilled it into an essence that is imitated, with varying success, to this day.Cary Grant plays slick adman Roger Thornhill, who gets mistaken for a fugitive named Kaplan and finds himself on the run from a slew of bad guys, led by James Mason at his smug and oily peak as Vandamme. Martin Landau makes his first memorable appearance as Mason's nastiest henchman Leonard (1959 was good to him, as Plan Nine From Outer Space premiered that year as well), suspicious, ruthless, and probably gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it was 1959 and that was a little daring.Daring also is Eva Marie Saint's Eve Kendall, a woman who uses sex, as Thornhill puts it, the way some people use a flyswatter. Her repartee with Thornhill shows just how erotic two people just talking to each other can be. It also provides further evidence Hitchcock's writers didn't go out on many dates. (Kendall I'm a big girl. Thornhill Yeah, and in all the right places. And she KISSES him for it!)The film does chug slowly at the outset, building suspense but also bugging you a bit as the plot gears grind while Thornhill is being pushed through his early paces, right until his moment at the UN. About the time we find ourselves with Thornhill in the cornfield, the picture starts to pick up a serious head of steam, and never loses it all the way to the final, famous tunnel shot. Actually, I like the penultimate scene between Grant and Saint, an elegant and witty way of resolving that most tried-and-true device, the cliffhanger.As with most of Hitchcock's &#145;50s fare, elegance is behind much of what makes this movie so great. `North By Northwest' manifests an elegance in dress, decor, language, music, and lighting that represents the best of its era while giving the picture a timeless character all the same. Hitchcock's camera movements are very subtle yet brilliant, as during Mason's entrance and Grant's hide-and-seek game around the train. Everyone has perfect hair, lounges about in gowns and jackets, and you never think it should be otherwise.Grant isn't my favorite actor, but he's smooth enough for the central role when he's not doing that bad Foster Brooks impression behind the wheel of the car. I docked the movie one point just for that. His best scene may be at the auction, though he projects real fear in the cornfield. Saint is simply splendid, nailing every line as she walks a tightrope and plays her character's motives close to her décolletage. Hitchcock seemed to lose his ability to direct female actors, and not merely bask in them, with the advent of color, but Saint is one blonde bombshell that gives us a sense of brains and personality behind her mystery.There's logic gaps in this movie, and bad process shots, but it's an amazing ride all the same, more amazing because it's done with smoke and mirrors and without apologies. You ask the questions and figure out the loopholes only after you walk away, because the movie doesn't let you up much while you are watching it. Hitchcock made other, more challenging movies that attested to his rare vision as an artist, but this is maybe his purest exercise in the craft of good filmmaking. That's why `North By Northwest' has remained so high in people's estimations. Whatever the errors, it's hard not feeling good about that.

How does a human being accomplish this by him\/her self as though physical weapons of this world have any impact on the spiritual warfare?

The first thirty minutes of the film is pretty much Andy and Larry sitting in your TV asking, `What is the Matrix?  What *is* the Matrix?

How the conflict is resolved, beginning with some advice from Mother, may seem realistic and true to some. Others raised on self-empowered heroines may think it's a trite sell-out.There's no question that young Redford fits the bill as Handsome & Charming, but it's a little hard to believe in him as a character who's supposed to be a stick in the mud. Fonda at this point had carved out a niche for herself in Wild, Untamed Belle roles, and she's fine again in that role here.

Now, 17 years later, I sat through Manhattan again and I have to say that I generally agree with the people here that say it's overrated.  After so many years of seeing Woody Allen's films, there is a repetitiveness in so many of his themes death, meaning of life (or lack of..) and infidelity.

The film is beautiful to look at sometimes but that is because he used Gordon Willis as his Director of Photography.  That man could make anything look great and here he does.  He even shoots scenes of garbage piled up on the streets and it looks OK.  The main problem with Manhattan and similar movies like Hannah and Her Sisters is that when all is said and done, why should we really care about any of these people?  I'm not expecting Allen to do a movie about welfare mothers or drug addicts in New York but these people are priviledged, spoiled white people who whine about death and how their relationships go no where.  After all these years, his movies have become pointless and stifling.  I still like Crimes and Misdemeanors and Bananas, Sleeper and Annie Hall.  But the guy thinks WAY too much of himself and his ideas.  The word now for Mr. Allen is insufferable.  It's too bad.  There was a time when he was truly dynamic.  Now he's irrelevant.

I know that seems a bit sad, but this film has so many memorable lines that it came so natural. I've watched this movie since I was a little girl and the strange thing is that every time I watch it, it just seems to get funnier and funnier. I don't understand how a person could not laugh with this film, it just has perfect humor that I'm sure could make the emotionally stunted person laugh. How could you not laugh at Rick Morannis as Lord Helmet? He was beyond a perfect choice for Helmet, he was the complete opposite of what Darth Vadar was, and he didn't have a problem making fun of himself. In fact, the whole cast looked like they had the ultimate blast making this film, everyone clicked so well. The story is one of Mel's finest parades, of course, this one is of Star Wars or pretty much any space film.Lord Helmet and President Skroob wish to steal all of Planet Druidia's fresh air and transfer it onto their own, but they must get the combination to the air shield that is protecting it. King Roland's daughter, Princess Vespa, runs away from her wedding, since King Roland is the king of Druidia, Lord Helmet kidnaps her to get the combination. King Roland asks space rebel, Lone Starr and his faithful side kick Mog(half-man half-dog) Barf, to save the princess. But things quickly turn bad when Helmet does get the combination and now Lone Starr must use the schwartz and defeat Lord Helmet and Skroob before they suck all the air from Druidia.Spaceballs is seriously just a great comedy, I guarantee you that you will have a good laugh by watching this film. Every scene is just so funny, my favorite is always the one with Lord Helmet playing with his dolls and Corinel Sanders walks in on him, you'll just have to see what I mean, but it's the funniest scene in my opinion. But there isn't one scene that isn't funny. If you are a fan of Mel Brooks, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't love this film, it's my second favorite just behind Young Frankenstein, but that was a tough choice. I highly recommend Spaceballs for anyone, please see this film, you won't regret it.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 November 2003","score":"76 out of 91 people found the following review useful","review":" Spaceballs is one of my favorite comedies of all time, it's actually one of those few movies that I know every single line too.

Every scene is just so funny, my favorite is always the one with Lord Helmet playing with his dolls and Corinel Sanders walks in on him, you'll just have to see what I mean, but it's the funniest scene in my opinion. But there isn't one scene that isn't funny. If you are a fan of Mel Brooks, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't love this film, it's my second favorite just behind Young Frankenstein, but that was a tough choice. I highly recommend Spaceballs for anyone, please see this film, you won't regret it.10\/10 ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"10 November 2003","score":"76 out of 91 people found the following review useful","review":" Spaceballs is one of my favorite comedies of all time, it's actually one of those few movies that I know every single line too. I know that seems a bit sad, but this film has so many memorable lines that it came so natural. I've watched this movie since I was a little girl and the strange thing is that every time I watch it, it just seems to get funnier and funnier. I don't understand how a person could not laugh with this film, it just has perfect humor that I'm sure could make the emotionally stunted person laugh. How could you not laugh at Rick Morannis as Lord Helmet? He was beyond a perfect choice for Helmet, he was the complete opposite of what Darth Vadar was, and he didn't have a problem making fun of himself. In fact, the whole cast looked like they had the ultimate blast making this film, everyone clicked so well. The story is one of Mel's finest parades, of course, this one is of Star Wars or pretty much any space film.Lord Helmet and President Skroob wish to steal all of Planet Druidia's fresh air and transfer it onto their own, but they must get the combination to the air shield that is protecting it. King Roland's daughter, Princess Vespa, runs away from her wedding, since King Roland is the king of Druidia, Lord Helmet kidnaps her to get the combination.

Sadly, it falls somewhere in between the two and fails to hit heights in either genre. I just got the feeling that from such a fantastic idea (a middle-aged woman turns to growing drugs to help her financial situation), so much more jokes could have been made of it. The best example of this was when Grace, a middle aged country woman, goes to london to try and sell her marujana plants. This had the potential for some hilarious jokes, instead the scene was plain and just not funny. Likewise in the drama side, it never seemed to hit any nerves or make you feel for the character, despite Brenda Blethyn playing the role incredibly convincingly.  In conclusion, Saving Grace is a sturdy film which stands alone as a watchable feel-good comedy, i just felt let down because such a good idea could have made such a better movie. Maybe the screenwriter was smoking the stuff rather than writing about it.

A realistic satire that exposes super heroes for what they really are  costume-clad outcasts who are consumed by their one-liners and motifs instead of fighting crime.The themes are hilarious, and yet not far from from comic book contents. The Shoveler, the disco boys, the frat boys.  The creators of this show evidently made the same realization as the creators of the Batman series starring Adam West  The only way to successfully transfer comic books subjects to film is to make fun of them.The film is satirical but also original.  Some highlights are Geoffrey Rush's grandiose ramblings while trying to convince the parole board he's sane, and Janeane Garofalo spontaneously seizing the opportunity to push independent artists.A few too many flatulence jokes and shovels in the face for my liking.For an equally realistic yet more serious portrayal of super heroes in the real world, see M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable, starring B. Willis and S. L. Jackson.
