I did not know that Cameron was one of veteran b-movie filmmaker Roger Corman's prodigies. At the time, I did not know much about Corman other than he had something to do with Battle Beyond the Stars which I liked although I thought it was rather silly.Cameron learned all of his tricks from Corman... As this film shows. Basically, Terminator was a B-Movie made to look like an A-Movie. Using all Corman's budget saving tricks, Cameron produced a film that at least to a viewer's initial viewing, looks like it had a much higher budget than it actually did - Much like Corman's AIC films of the 60's.Now Terminator borrowed heavily from basic science fiction material, to the point where Harlan Ellison sued due to plot details similar to his short story Demon with a Glass Hand which was made into an Outer Limits episode - One of the earliest Science Fiction things I had ever seen, I was maybe 4 years old when I saw Demon with a Glass Hand. I did notice the similarities, but basically I did not care. You can also see elements which may have been influenced by the short story All you Zombies by the dean of science fiction, Robert Anson Heinlein. The Terminator then, borrowed from both of these sources. I was not surprised to learn later that Harlan Ellision sued to get story recognition put on the credits of the film, this was a very Ellision thing to do- Cameron should have done this in the first place though, you can't just borrow parts of plots from Hugo Award winning science fiction stories - And Cameron did it again in Avatar, borrowing the main plot elements of Poul Anderson's Call me Joe (Guy in a wheelchair, spinal injury, moon of a superjovian planet, remote controlling a genetically created body on the surface of said moon and eventual transfer into that body), and since Poul Anderson passed in 2008, I'd say Cameron released Avatar just in time, eh? But he did not get away with it in 1984, as he was a fledgling director at the time. What Cameron did, was blend these borrowed items, and he created a new piece of work. Now, it never bothers me that film writers borrow from all over, in 1984 Cameron was made to put the acknowledgment into the film, and I am glad for that, because as I was sitting in the theatre, I was thinking, This guy reads a LOT of Science Fiction - And as his taste was just like mine, I wholly enjoyed seeing the material used.Now what nobody really knew was how immensely popular this film would become, basically shadowing Arnold Schwarzenegger to this date with I'll be Back and other quotes- Actually The Terminator is responsible for creating a whole subculture based on some of the phrases from the film. But what The Terminator really did was create a launching point for a Franchise.This film was a milestone for Special Effects Animatronix Wizard Stan Winston - Who created a whole working mechanical Arnold for a lot of the shots which reveal Terminator internal workings. When you view Terminator in 2011, these effects look rather primitive - What people have to realise that in 1984, nothing like that had ever been done before. This put both Cameron and Winston on the map from then on. Also we can thank Tom Woodruff, Jr, who has operated Winston (and other creatures) effects from the 80's through the 2010's.This film also made use of unknown actors, Michael Beihn, Linda Hamilton, the three punks Brad Reardon, Brian Thompshon (The Shape Changing Alien from X-Files) and of course the great Bill Paxton. And of course this was the breakthrough for Arnold even more than Conan the Barbarian... More people identify Arnie as The Terminator rather than any role where he basically ran around in a loincloth.Now, I really don't care that Cameron basically borrowed material from several Hugo-Award Winning Science Fiction Authors, because nobody was USING that material, and any films made from material by those greats (A Boy and His Dog) were done poorly... Now here is a director not afraid to take this source material and make it LOOK the way it was written in these classic Sci-Fi stories, and so what we have here, is Part One of a now-Quadrilogy of great Sci Fi stories - This first installment set the basic foundation, and what has been done, is that Cameron is now responsible for creating a new kind of American Mythology based on these borrowed concepts of Time Travel, Cyborg Soldier, Grandfather Paradox (Ie - Man goes back in time, becomes his own grandfather). Just as Lord of the Rings was created by JRR Tolkein to become a new kind of British Folklore, The Terminator has become part of An American Folklore.

She, and some nameless body double for the nude scenes, played a troubled young woman who deviously inserts herself into a family and wrecks havoc in their lives. A few years later they did Poison Ivy II, which is one of those Fraudulent Sequels where an original script is altered just enough to be barely connected to the first film. Poison Ivy II starred Alyssa Milano and, I believe, no body double for the nude scenes. Just a year after that they came out with Poison Ivy The New Seduction, which is one of those Fraudulent Sequels where they simply remake the first film and slap different names on all the characters. This one starred Jaime Pressly as the sister of Barrymore's character and she also deviously inserts herself into a family and wrecks havoc in their lives. Not only did Pressly have no body double for the nude scenes but her nubile form is the best thing this flick has going for it. So, this franchise went from movie child star to TV child star to young actress nobody had ever heard of, a great example of Hollywood devolution.Let's be clear about something. By the time they got down to this movie, no one had any illusions about what they were making except, perhaps, the young Miss Pressly. This is a trashy melodrama without even a spark of true creativity or dramatic ambition. Having said that...it's not terrible. Yes, a couple of Benedictine monks who've taken vows of silence could have written snappier dialog. Yes, none of the characters have any existence beyond what the plot requires, with one actually existing only as a disembodied voice on the phone. Yes, it's directed with all the flair of an episode of Matt Houston. And yes, it has an ending that basically screams We've run out of money! What's the cheapest possible way we can kill of the villain?For all that, the young Miss Pressley looks damn good without any clothes on and even shows the makings of a fine actress, though one that still needed further training. When the story call on her to act crazy, Pressley clearly had no idea what she was doing. There's also enough activity going on to keep the film from grinding to a halt and it only minimally insults the viewer's intelligence. Michael Des Barres gives the yeoman's performance you'd expect and Megan Edwards is awfully appealing, though even more awfully is never nude.As crap movies go, Poison Ivy The New Seduction isn't that bad. I wouldn't suggest anyone spend money to rent it but if you can find it playing unedited on TV, there are worse ways to waste 95 minutes.

She, and some nameless body double for the nude scenes, played a troubled young woman who deviously inserts herself into a family and wrecks havoc in their lives. A few years later they did Poison Ivy II, which is one of those Fraudulent Sequels where an original script is altered just enough to be barely connected to the first film. Poison Ivy II starred Alyssa Milano and, I believe, no body double for the nude scenes. Just a year after that they came out with Poison Ivy The New Seduction, which is one of those Fraudulent Sequels where they simply remake the first film and slap different names on all the characters. This one starred Jaime Pressly as the sister of Barrymore's character and she also deviously inserts herself into a family and wrecks havoc in their lives. Not only did Pressly have no body double for the nude scenes but her nubile form is the best thing this flick has going for it.

This is done with great skill and without ever appearing to be rushed. Time is taken to introduce the various characters and to show their relationships to each other before the meticulous planning process is carried out and every stage of the robbery is then shown in great detail and every aspect of the numerous events that follow is depicted briskly and commendably, without any loss of clarity.The robbery itself is shown in a remarkably tense 28 minute sequence during which there is no dialogue and every action seems vital to the success of the operation. The suspense then increases further when it becomes clear that the time available to the gang is very close to running out.Tony le Stephanois (Jean Servais), an ageing criminal who's just been released from prison, meets up with his protégé Jo le Suedois (Carl Mohner) who suggests that they carry out a jewellery robbery together with Mario Ferrati (Robert Manuel). After considering Jo's proposal, Tony decides not to take part and instead tracks down his ex-girlfriend Mado (Marie Sabouret) who, in his absence, has taken up with Pierre Grutter (Marcel Lupovici) a rival gangster and nightclub owner. Tony takes Mado back to his apartment where he becomes angry about her relationship with Grutter and brutally beats her with a belt. Afterwards, he reconsiders Jo's offer and decides to take part in the heist subject to various changes being made to the original plan.The three men take on expert safe-cracker Cesar le Milanais (Jules Dassin credited as Perlo Vita) of whom it's said that there's no safe that can resist Cesar and no woman that Cesar can resist. On arrival in Paris, Cesar soon starts a relationship with Viviane (Magali Noel) who's a singer at Grutter's nightclub.The four men successfully carry out the robbery and arrangements are in hand for the hot jewels to be fenced. During the robbery, without anyone else noticing, Cesar took a diamond ring which he kept and later gave to Viviane. When Grutter sees Viviane's ring he quickly deduces who's carried out the high profile heist and after getting information out of Cesar, goes after the other gang members so that he can pocket the proceeds of the heist for himself. The action that Grutter subsequently takes (including the kidnapping of Jo's son) ultimately leads to none of the gang profiting from the success of the heist.Rififi was the second film that Jules Dassin had made in Europe after having been blacklisted in Hollywood during the McCarthy era and interestingly his character betrays his fellow gang members just as he himself had been betrayed by others who gave evidence about him to the House Committee on Un-American Activities.Tony is man who looks drained, disillusioned and haggard and who doesn't even look forward to enjoying the rewards that he can reasonably expect to gain from the heist. Jean Servais is magnificent in this role as his appearance and manner so perfectly reflect Tony's state of mind. He also conveys powerfully the innate sadness of a man who's compelled to live by his own code of principles even when doing the right thing brings him profound regret (as happens when he has to deal with Cesar's betrayal). He is though, also capable of kindness and selflessness as he had protected Jo from having to serve a prison sentence and also had a warm relationship with his Godson (Jo's son).Gang member Mario provides the movie with its most humorous moments and Viviane supplies the musical entertainment with a great rendition of the title song which explains the meaning of Rififi.The moody Paris locations provide an ideal backdrop for this story of greed, cruelty, betrayal and revenge and it's incredible just how engrossing this low budget movie remains so many years after it was first released.

Well, first, I think it was a film that slowly caught on and many people also just didn't know what to think of this anti-Hollywood and anti-Broadway film. Second, 1958 was an amazingly good year in films and all but one of the Best Picture nominees were amazing films. Whether or not they were better or worse than Sweet Smell of Success is debatable but they almost all were terrific films--Bridge on the Rive Kwai, 12 Angry Men, Sayonara and Witness for the Prosecution were all up for the big award (how Peyton Place, a very glossy soap opera, got nominated is beyond me). However, neither Curtis nor Lancaster even got nominated..and that is inexplicable.the ","genre":"Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"6 May 2011","score":"","review":" A few years back, as i perused the aisles of HMV for quality DVDs, I encountered the two-disc special edition of Taxi Driver which i didn't then own.

Certainly the ending in which an expressionless Betsy is escorted home by an apparently unchanged Travis is very ethereal and would seem the perfectly unimaginative wordless fantasy of a dying loner like Bickle.

He has certain positive qualities - engaging personality, good looks, quick mind - which are canceled by his many flaws &#x96; vanity, ambition, envy, just to name a few &#x96; which drives him to worship a false god, in the person of J. J. Hunsecker, the epitome of everything Falco wants to emulate. The trouble is, Falco's false god is so flawed that anyone who worships him will be corrupted. Falco's god does not dispense blessings. Rather, he dispenses meanness. Yet, Falco by nature is not inherently mean. He is not ruthless like Eleanor Iselin or Joel Cairo. He wants to better himself socially but is guided by a distorted set of values which he has learned from a culture that is depraved. Falco knows the difference between right and wrong, yet he chooses to do wrong because to do right simply does not pay off. But by doing wrong he pays the price - not for his amorality but because he messes with the wrong people Hunsecker, Steve, Frank, Officer Kello, Susan, Rita. These people know the street and are aggressive, and when they're hit, they hit back, hard, and Falco is doing everything he can to get a beating. But he is oblivious to that because he doesn't yet realize with whom he is dealing. But he finally learns it, the hard way, when he does something good, i.e., saves Susan's life. Instead of thanks, he gets his butt kicked, and then not once, but twice, first by Hunsecker, who gives him a taste of what is to come, and then by Kello, who finishes the job. Falco's good deed means nothing in a culture in which the most valued form of social interaction is the trading of information for favors. Falco would have done himself a huge favor by having let Susan jump; it would have given him leverage, which would have jump-started his career and earned him the instant recognition that he craved. He would have had the inside scoop on the most sensational story of the year, one that would have destroyed Hunsecker Sister driven to suicide by overbearing brother. The resulting scandal would have propelled Falco to instant stardom. It would have made him king of the gossip-mongers. He would have shared with the world every sordid detail, from how Hunsecker first recruited him to destroy a romance involving Steve and Hunsecker's sister, to how Hunsecker's launched a vendetta against Steve, to how Hunsecker ordered him to frame Steve, to how he got the message to rush over to Hunsecker's apartment, to how he arrived just at the moment that Susan was about to jump, and finally to how Hunsecker reacted after learning that his sister had committed suicide. Everyone involved would have become the subject of the most intense scrutiny, by the police and by the press. Falco's name would have been blasted all over the media. It would have become a media circus with Falco as the ringmaster. The relationship between Hunsecker and Officer Kello would have been revealed. Kello might have quit his job and gone to work for Falco. The whole world would have learned about Hunsecker's cold and ruthless nature. Speculation on the nature of Hunsecker's relationship with his sister would have been rampant. Every gossip columnist in the world would have been knocking on Falco's door for the story, not so much to learn about a tragic death of a young woman but to gather mud to use against Hunsecker, with Falco in charge of the mud pit. But Falco messes up; although brash and pushy, he's not yet cruel; he's still not jaded enough to exploit death; he does good when the situation required that he do bad, like Hunsecker would have done.

Unlike the two previous films Dr. No and From Russia with Love that took themselves pretty seriously, Goldfinger has a more comic book like touch that borders over-the-top, but doesn't go full silliness like some later movies in series. It is definitely the most well-known and one of the best Bond movies.While on a vacation in Florida, James Bond is assigned to keep an eye on Auric Goldfinger, a wealthy gold industrialist. Bond discovers Goldfinger is cheating at cards and humiliates the man. This however leads to the death of Goldfinger's beautiful assistant who Bond seduced to help him. Later Bond is sent to find out how Goldfinger is smuggling gold out of UK. While on this he also discovers that Goldfinger is planning something far more sinister.The film is directed by Guy Hamilton, the first of the four Bond films he directed. Hamilton's films always have a more humorous touch in them, but Goldfinger is not yet as campy as the three later films would be. What makes Goldfinger so memorable are its many famous moments, such as Bond finding the murdered girl covered in gold paint or later being strapped on a table with laser approaching his crotch. This is also the movie where the gadgets started to become a part of Bond's life, such as the Aston Martin car with an ejection seat and other fun surprises. John Barry's score and Shirley Bassey's theme song, probably the most well-known Bond theme ever, deserves to be mentioned as well.The cast is great. Sean Connery plays Bond for the third time and he seems to be having fun, getting to be even wittier than before. Honor Blackman plays Pussy Galore (that name would never pass today's censorship), a woman who seems more interested in her female workers than of Bond. Seducing her might be one of Bond's greatest accomplishments ever. Gert Fröbe is Goldfinger, a big man with twice as big ego. Unlike other early Bond villains he is not working for Russians or SPECTRE, but to himself. He also gets the best line in the history of Bond villains. Eternally memorable Harold Sakata plays Oddjob, Goldfinger's silent but deadly henchman whose own hat is a lethal weapon.Goldfinger is a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but that still provides excitement, action and entertainment. Many Bond films have later tried to copy its mood but have often just become plain silly. Goldfinger is one of the most memorable of its kind and highly recommended.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"6 May 2011","score":"","review":" The third movie in the series, Goldfinger (1964), is often considered to be the definitive Bond film and it is most certainly most copied one. Unlike the two previous films Dr. No and From Russia with Love that took themselves pretty seriously, Goldfinger has a more comic book like touch that borders over-the-top, but doesn't go full silliness like some later movies in series. It is definitely the most well-known and one of the best Bond movies.While on a vacation in Florida, James Bond is assigned to keep an eye on Auric Goldfinger, a wealthy gold industrialist. Bond discovers Goldfinger is cheating at cards and humiliates the man. This however leads to the death of Goldfinger's beautiful assistant who Bond seduced to help him. Later Bond is sent to find out how Goldfinger is smuggling gold out of UK. While on this he also discovers that Goldfinger is planning something far more sinister.The film is directed by Guy Hamilton, the first of the four Bond films he directed. Hamilton's films always have a more humorous touch in them, but Goldfinger is not yet as campy as the three later films would be. What makes Goldfinger so memorable are its many famous moments, such as Bond finding the murdered girl covered in gold paint or later being strapped on a table with laser approaching his crotch. This is also the movie where the gadgets started to become a part of Bond's life, such as the Aston Martin car with an ejection seat and other fun surprises. John Barry's score and Shirley Bassey's theme song, probably the most well-known Bond theme ever, deserves to be mentioned as well.The cast is great. Sean Connery plays Bond for the third time and he seems to be having fun, getting to be even wittier than before. Honor Blackman plays Pussy Galore (that name would never pass today's censorship), a woman who seems more interested in her female workers than of Bond.

The build-up scenes are well done with a great deal of tension.

This starts with a strange scene where a car containing a murderous gang is pursued by a vengeful father whose daughter has been killed by them. One of the gang steps out of the car into the open and basically lets himself by shot.

Shoulders arched and head low, Bell moves through unadorned halls, overcrowded locker rooms. There's not one of you that's learned how to win! He thunders out, slamming the door only to come back to heave a water tank across the room and trudge out again. On the court, fans shouting, cheerleaders abound, band playing, Bell's face is anxious, his fuse lit again. Cries and chaos churn around Bell like he's within a bulldozer. His university team plays vigorously, but drop the ball, miss hoops. He hangs a towel overhead to shield his eyes. At loggerheads with a ref, Bell kicks the ball up into the stands and is disqualified. After winning national championships, Nolte's Bell is at risk of having his first losing season. And joblessness.He could procure blue chip prospects, giving them cash, cars, etc. But in two respects he's unable to take advantage. Primarily, if I break the rules I get kicked out of coaching. Next, I might not get caught. It's Bell's ethical predicament. Blue Chips is not about the fight for victory but the fight to defeat. That's the appeal. Bell's passion for winning forces him to be disloyal to himself. Contempt comes in the figure of J.T. Walsh's gladly corrupt, obnoxious alum. When Bell refuses his first proposal of money to draft blue chip players, he tells Bell they make millions for the university for nothing in return and a multi-year contract for him, that they're owed these inducements. Bell storms off but the press-stud is in as he can see no other way. It's the vehicle for Bell's self-destruction.Director William Friedkin's drawn to desperate characters with very few choices. His portrayal of college basketball bribery may be pessimistic, and Bell may be having an emergency of principles, but it's not especially gripping. His ex-wife Mary McDonnell asks him if he cheated. He denies it. Later, when she learns the facts, she sobbingly says she can't trust him anymore. A point-shaving rumor has hung over Bell for awhile. Walsh says it's true, go look at the tape. Bell does. His response is somewhat stupid, saying with surprise that he coached a rigged game. Bell wasn't a schemer but a dupe! He's acting like he perpetrated an offense against humankind. After his recently bought team's climactic game, Bell says words he never thought he'd say. It's paradoxical, but what does it matter? Friedkin tries to infuse some visual strength into the narrative when one of Bell's procured athletes tells the Coach he's homesick but if he goes, will his mother lose her new house that the friends of the program gave her? Bell pretends unawareness of any arrangement. Friedkin begins the scene at Dutch angles, calling direct awareness to itself, the purpose vague. Is it showing Bell's world growing uncontrollable? We already got that when he sat alone in the gym staring longingly at the championship banners, imagined the cheering of past triumphs, sees no option but to cheat. Or when his wife asked him if he deceived and he denies. Bell approaches the gym before the final game, and we see him from another Dutch angle. They seem incompatible and bland here.There are of course elements of Ron Shelton's script that Friedkin helms shrewdly. Bell's introductory locker talk and the first game, for instance. Later, Bell follows coaches who are also probing blue chip possibilities. One of them is Ricky from French Lick. They watch a main street parade highlighting the town pet, Larry Bird, and Ricky riding together in a convertible. The coaches beckon but then look shocked as Friedkin shows Bell, grinningly gesturing back at them from the driver's seat.Another high point is the introduction of Shaq's character Neon in a Louisiana backwoods storehouse playing ruthless street basketball, a Goliath smashing the ball through the hoop over and over, his fierce expression defying the other players to face up to him.

Of course, the fans will be pleased, like this film over the next films but it's dull and unimaginative. It's entertaining, visually impressive, well acted, so close to perfection but so inoffensive, lacking in anything. Maybe the director should stop caring about what other people think, follow artistic instincts yet still keep to the plot. It's hard to find any sense of magic in here. And I have read the novels, but I am an avid film fan and understand the difficulties of trying to turn a book into a novel. People pleasing just turns potential classics into uninspired movies.

The director is such a people pleaser that despite the surprisingly violent finale, this film lacks grit, character and lacks any source of imagination. Of course, the fans will be pleased, like this film over the next films but it's dull and unimaginative. It's entertaining, visually impressive, well acted, so close to perfection but so inoffensive, lacking in anything. Maybe the director should stop caring about what other people think, follow artistic instincts yet still keep to the plot. It's hard to find any sense of magic in here. And I have read the novels, but I am an avid film fan and understand the difficulties of trying to turn a book into a novel. People pleasing just turns potential classics into uninspired movies.

Basically Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) has retired from the Navy and works as a chef for the Mile High Cafe in Denver, Colorado, and he is on a big train taking his niece Sarah (Knocked Up's Katherine Heigl) on vacation. The train is travelling through the Rocky Mountains heading to Los Angeles, and on the journey it is taken hostage by Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian) and his mercenary gang. He is using the movement of the train to cover up his signal linked to a weapon satellite in outer space that is capable of devastating big areas. Travis caused an earthquake in China blowing up a chemical plant, and he is demanding a ransom of one billion dollars from the Pentagon to end the destruction and release the hostages. With some outside help, it is obviously up to Casey to save the hostages, get the Pentagon aware of their location to capture the villains, and obviously he has to kill any of the bad guys who deserve it. Also starring Morris Chestnut as Bobby Zachs, Everett McGill as Marcus Penn, Deep Impact's Kurtwood Smith as General Stanley Cooper, Nick Mancuso as Tom Breaker, Andy Romano as Admiral Bates, Brenda Bakke as Captain Linda Gilder, Sandra Taylor as Kelly - Barmaid, Jonathan Banks as Scotty - Mercenary, Peter Greene as Mercenary #1 and Dale Dye as Captain Garza. Seagal does good martial arts moves and that, and Bogosian is a naff crazy villain, the fight scenes don't really make any difference, especially because of the location with limited to have happen, compared to a battleship it is daft, well, the whole film is a daft and dull action thriller. Adequate!
