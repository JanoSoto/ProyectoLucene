[{"date":"18 October 2012","score":"","review":" In the nineties, the Farrelly Brothers were dominating the comedy\/drama genres with their energetic, screwball scenarios for their quirky, genial subjects to fall into. From the charming goofiness of There's Something About Mary to their passably dopey Dumb and Dumber, the Farrelly's seemed to pitch every possible idea to Miramax and they willingly committed to making it happen. The directors were the studio's biggest moneymaker, so as a result, we got all different kinds of films from the directors, good and bad.And after watching both of the previously mentioned efforts and was met with marginal satisfaction, my idea to venture into the Farrelly's lesser-known film Outside Providence, which was critically underwhelming and financially disastrous compared to the previous films. The film is simple, good-natured, and an easy watch, but at no point does this become more than a methodical tip-toe through the woods of clichés.Our main character is Timothy Dildo Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy), an underachieving high school senior with a strict father (Alec Baldwin) and a handicapped brother (Tommy Bone) he treats like a regular person to avoid showing any resemblance of superiority or difference towards him. The small family resides in Pawtucket, Road Island, and after Timothy and friends crash into a parked police car with marijuana on their person, his father tires from his blatant incompetence and sends him to Cornwall Academy, a strict prep school in Connecticut.Upon arriving, Timothy is placed in the lower-level classes and is mocked, tormented, and left a social pariah with the other more advanced men of the school. He quickly becomes acquainted with Amy Smart's Jane Weston, an attractive blonde girl he believes is the nicest, prettiest one there. At the same time, while being harassed by a number of the kids, Timothy finds that Cornwall's dorm master, Mr. Funderburk (Timothy Crowe), is out to get him and continues to devise plans to avoid him or even pull the occasional prank or two.The film was based on a book written by Peter Farrelly a year before, with Farrelly stating the film is a marginally fictionalized account of his real experiences at a prep school in Connecticut. I could already assume that the film is pretty fictional, because I would expect quirkier, more unique experiences from one of the most famous comedy directors in the business.Shawn Hatosy gives us a kind-hearted, but overall, bland character to deal with, proving that he has the charisma and screen presence but not the proper material to sustain a ninety-five minute excursion. The most admirably compelling performance in the film is that of Alec Baldwin's whose cut throat, east-coast attitude is somewhat out of place but not the less welcoming in a film filled dead-end material.Ultimately, the highest regard I can pay to Outside Providence is its wonderful use of seventies songs, all of which easily recognizable and wonderfully engaging. From All Right Now to Free Bird, and don't forget the little nuanced things like a copy of Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the Farrelly brothers and co-writer, Michael Corrente, clearly recall the seventies with vivid clarity. And to be fair, as competent, basic entertainment, Outside Providence maybe just what some are looking for. It's a rather quick comedy, over in the blink of an eye, and you're left to either praise it for its simplicity or bash it for the same reason. For the comedy genre, it won't be the straw that breaks the camel's back. For the Farrelly's, it may have gotten Miramax to wake up.Starring Shawn Hatosy, Alec Baldwin, Amy Smart, Timothy Crowe, and Tommy Bone. Directed by Michael Corrente.

It's an animal-centered movie but through its inspirational story and endearing sweetness, remains closer to Bambi and Dumbo than The Jungle Book or even The Lion King.Babe is the name of a little pig that grew up in an Australian farm owned by Arthur Hogget (James Cromwell) and dreamed of becoming a sheep dog. But there's a time to get to that dream, and the director Chris Noonan starts by immersing us into the farm, it's in Australia, but as a matter of fact, it can be any farm, as imagined by any child from any place in the world. Farm in Babe is not just a beautiful dream-like setting, it happens to be a codified universe where each species has a specific place depending on its utility. The rooster wakes up the farmer, the hens make eggs, cows give milk, dogs herd the sheep, cat chase mice, horses transport etc. In this hierarchy, pigs are in the bottom, their only purpose being to grow up, to get fat so they can be eaten and go to Paradise, a place so beautiful no pig ever came back from. The film deals with pigs' fate with a gravity that mirrors the dramatic death of Bambi's mother, but also through comedy with the unforgettable Ferdinand the Duck who tries to replace the rooster to be spared from being eaten. Babe is an outcast, but like Dumbo and in a lesser measure Pinocchio, in the gentle sense of the word. Indeed, he wants to be useful, to be part of the farm's collective effort. The charm of Babe is to create a character to which any kid can identify with; inspired by the idea of following their dreams no matter how silly they sound. But nothing is silly when handled in a smooth and sensitive way. Babe respects the order and the leadership of Rex, the male sheepdog, he plays with Rex and his female Fly's puppies, but they have the right to be in home, along with the cat, but he can't. This feeling of rejection is the cement of kids' personalities because it's a way for children to determine what they can bring to the others.The story goes on, punctuated by the songs of three little mice, with a high-pitched voice that make anything they say irresistible to the ears. The film is an extraordinary achievement as it really focuses on animals' feelings more than their actions. In a sad scene where Rex and Fly's puppies are sold, you could see the sadness in the two parent's eyes, and ironically, Rex, the hard-nosed and grouchy one seemed to be most devastated, we'd learn later than he'd already experience loss. The 'puppies' scene isn't shot in an overly dramatic way because its main purpose is to show that even the sheepdogs must deal with some aspects of their lives they don't necessary like. The second purpose is to build the relationship between Babe and Fly.As a new adoptive mother, Fly believes that Babe can make a good replacement for Rex, who never won a championship since the day he lost sheep during a pouring rain and became almost deaf. The farm owner, Hogget, sees the same potential in Babe and decides to give him a chance. Why? As the narrator says These little ideas that tickled and nagged and refused to go away should never be ignored for in them lie the seeds of destiny, that's the kind of movie quotes that takes you by surprise and displays a level of smartness that can appeal to both kids and adults. Also, it starts off the core of the story, which is less the coming-of-age of Babe than the beautiful relationship between the little pig and his master.James Cromwell, was rightfully Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor because this is the kind of role you can't cheat on. It might be easy to pretend to talk to a pig, but there are emotions that cannot be feigned, and the look on Cromwell's eyes in some scenes betrayed a genuine attachment. But again, it's not that easy to make out of a pig, a believable sheep dog. In a key scene, Fly orders Babe to shout at the sheep, to be more aggressive. After all, he's still a pig, his master might change his mind it's still a life-and-death situation. That was the make it or break it part of the script, had Babe commanded the sheep through violence, the film would have lost me. Naturally, Babe respects both the children and the adult's intelligence by not operating a 180° turn on its character. Babe is first mocked but it's by talking to the sheep gently, by explaining what he wants to Maa, the older one, that he gets what he wants. The point is not to teach that being nice might open every door, but that sometimes you get to better results by getting things your way. It's about respecting the others, and not assuming someone's silly or wouldn't understand because he or she's different. The dogs are constantly insulting sheep but a very clever twist reveals at the end, that the sheep doesn't think much of the dogs either, both prejudices being due to some ancestral conditioning. If anything, Babe is a lesson of humility, gentleness and perseverance.The ending can come as predictable but there's more in the film than a simple plot. it's about self-acceptance, respect before inspiring the recognition and the love of people that count in our lives, something powerfully conveyed by the Cromwell's face with his That'll do, pig. That'll do.And from a man of few words, each one carried the same magical resonance than the moment where Pinocchio became a real boy and Dumbo started flying in the circus.

I couldn't see how the magic of the first film would operate again, what new could Babe ever learn? I compared Babe to Bambi and Dumbo and the idea of a sequel was as ludicrous as the sequels trend that almost ruined the Disney classics.Yet Roger Ebert put the film on his top 10 list of best movies released in 1998 (the original Babe had only 3 stars) and Gene Siskel made it the top on his list, but I thought it was a sentimental choice for a man for a reason that makes me feel guilty now. Anyway, I was wondering how the film could surpass the original and made the two critic's list, but then I recall what Ebert said once when they disagree, one is right and the other is wrong, when they both agree, they're both right. That's enough due to my respect for the distinguished critics, to give the film at least the benefit of the doubt, and watch it to see where I stand for.In fact, it's all a matter of mindset, if you decide to watch Babe Pig in the City as a sequel recreating the same cutesy magic of the first opus, you prepare yourself to a big disappointment because the film carries much darker undertones than the first, featuring in very explicit scenes, the notion of violence and some unexpected near-death experiences. But it's less a flaw but rather than the basis of the film's originality. Babe Pig in the City is not a sequel, not even a part II, it's simply the recreation of a character in a new universe, and what a beautiful universe. I said that the farm in Babe could be any farm; the same applies for the city. It feels like a city, something like Sidney or New York, yet it avoids all these clichés, there's no sight of animals crossing a road in the middle of a traffic jam, or meeting a group of hookers or kids in skateboards. The city is here without its archetypes, and that's the big surprise of the film it's still an animal-centered movie.However, the film takes is kind of slow when it comes to gain our trust. I must admit I was so perplexed about the 'sequel' that the opening sequence made me cringe, the sight of good old Arthur Hogget (James Crowell) being accidentally wounded after the water pumping incident took me by surprise, but I didn't see the violence because I guess I was relieved he didn't die. Babe Pig in the City is full of unsettling moments where we feel the presence of death, and really expect a character to pass away. It starts with a fire caused during a circus show, ruining the act of a clown played by Mickey Rooney, later, a pit bull who savagely chases Babe and then throws him in a river, before accidentally hanging himself and almost drowning in the water, there's also a goldfish asking for help after a bowl is broken, and a dog on wheels that gets hit by a car. Yet the genius of these scenes is to flirt with violence without getting too much disturbing for children, because no one dies.The film, directed by George Miller, didn't meet the same critical success than the first, it was even a box-office flop, and I guess the darker tone was to blame. The problem is that retrospectively, if you compare the film to any other one made after, it has everything that would make it a classic a magnificent setting, actions, thrills, comedy through an unforgettable climax involving a swinging chandeliers and a scene-stealing Esme Hogget, played by a talented Magda Zubanski, who forms an irresistible duo with the tall and slim landlady (Mary Stein). And last point, if not a message, the film shows a new facet of animals, as living creatures. In many films, you see fishes agonizing after a bowl is broken, but what if you could hear them talking? That's the little details that elevate the film above the common children's movies. And the monkeys are the real stars of the show and they're absolutely believable, as the closest animals to men, it's interesting that George Miller chose to focus on them as to give them a sort of human look, not human as 'like us', but as 'more human that us'.Babe Pig in the City had all the ingredients to be a great and successful film, but I guess it only suffered by comparison with the first film, and its failure put an end to what could have been a beautiful saga. But what a second sequel, how thrilling it is, some parts are weird and it takes its time to grab you but when the action starts, it's really a heart-pounding experience, with great special effects, and unforgettable characters, Babe is here, the three singing mice, and Ferdinand the Duck desperately trying to follow the airplane, creates a hilarious moment, but was it as funny as the go fly, noble duck, from the pelicans, or the unfortunate place he landed.? I concede the film is a little adult-oriented at times, but there's no way a kid could really be traumatized by this, or let me be more direct, if any parent believes that it's too much for kids, then they should also throw away movies like Pinocchio (think of Monstro, the Coachman, Stromboli), Bambi, and Fantasia and while they're at it, every animated film containing a death.Babe Pig in the City trusted the maturity of its audience but it went wrong somewhere, whatever is the reason, I don't put the blame on the film which, if not as great as the first, because the element of surprise disappeared, is a gutsy sequel with some parts that transcend the charm of the original.

The city is here without its archetypes, and that's the big surprise of the film it's still an animal-centered movie.However, the film takes is kind of slow when it comes to gain our trust. I must admit I was so perplexed about the 'sequel' that the opening sequence made me cringe, the sight of good old Arthur Hogget (James Crowell) being accidentally wounded after the water pumping incident took me by surprise, but I didn't see the violence because I guess I was relieved he didn't die. Babe Pig in the City is full of unsettling moments where we feel the presence of death, and really expect a character to pass away. It starts with a fire caused during a circus show, ruining the act of a clown played by Mickey Rooney, later, a pit bull who savagely chases Babe and then throws him in a river, before accidentally hanging himself and almost drowning in the water, there's also a goldfish asking for help after a bowl is broken, and a dog on wheels that gets hit by a car. Yet the genius of these scenes is to flirt with violence without getting too much disturbing for children, because no one dies.The film, directed by George Miller, didn't meet the same critical success than the first, it was even a box-office flop, and I guess the darker tone was to blame. The problem is that retrospectively, if you compare the film to any other one made after, it has everything that would make it a classic a magnificent setting, actions, thrills, comedy through an unforgettable climax involving a swinging chandeliers and a scene-stealing Esme Hogget, played by a talented Magda Zubanski, who forms an irresistible duo with the tall and slim landlady (Mary Stein). And last point, if not a message, the film shows a new facet of animals, as living creatures. In many films, you see fishes agonizing after a bowl is broken, but what if you could hear them talking? That's the little details that elevate the film above the common children's movies. And the monkeys are the real stars of the show and they're absolutely believable, as the closest animals to men, it's interesting that George Miller chose to focus on them as to give them a sort of human look, not human as 'like us', but as 'more human that us'.Babe Pig in the City had all the ingredients to be a great and successful film, but I guess it only suffered by comparison with the first film, and its failure put an end to what could have been a beautiful saga. But what a second sequel, how thrilling it is, some parts are weird and it takes its time to grab you but when the action starts, it's really a heart-pounding experience, with great special effects, and unforgettable characters, Babe is here, the three singing mice, and Ferdinand the Duck desperately trying to follow the airplane, creates a hilarious moment, but was it as funny as the go fly, noble duck, from the pelicans, or the unfortunate place he landed.? I concede the film is a little adult-oriented at times, but there's no way a kid could really be traumatized by this, or let me be more direct, if any parent believes that it's too much for kids, then they should also throw away movies like Pinocchio (think of Monstro, the Coachman, Stromboli), Bambi, and Fantasia and while they're at it, every animated film containing a death.Babe Pig in the City trusted the maturity of its audience but it went wrong somewhere, whatever is the reason, I don't put the blame on the film which, if not as great as the first, because the element of surprise disappeared, is a gutsy sequel with some parts that transcend the charm of the original.

I couldn't see how the magic of the first film would operate again, what new could Babe ever learn? I compared Babe to Bambi and Dumbo and the idea of a sequel was as ludicrous as the sequels trend that almost ruined the Disney classics.Yet Roger Ebert put the film on his top 10 list of best movies released in 1998 (the original Babe had only 3 stars) and Gene Siskel made it the top on his list, but I thought it was a sentimental choice for a man for a reason that makes me feel guilty now. Anyway, I was wondering how the film could surpass the original and made the two critic's list, but then I recall what Ebert said once when they disagree, one is right and the other is wrong, when they both agree, they're both right. That's enough due to my respect for the distinguished critics, to give the film at least the benefit of the doubt, and watch it to see where I stand for.In fact, it's all a matter of mindset, if you decide to watch Babe Pig in the City as a sequel recreating the same cutesy magic of the first opus, you prepare yourself to a big disappointment because the film carries much darker undertones than the first, featuring in very explicit scenes, the notion of violence and some unexpected near-death experiences. But it's less a flaw but rather than the basis of the film's originality. Babe Pig in the City is not a sequel, not even a part II, it's simply the recreation of a character in a new universe, and what a beautiful universe.

His Prime Minister, Leonid Kleist (played by Patrick Malahide), insures that Boris rules with an iron fist. Joy arrives and becomes instrumental in introducing much needed change. More importantly though, she changes Boris for the better as well. Now, while this plot is extremely predictable, the comedy is anything but that as there are many surprises written into the script that are simply hilarious and I think the writer (Todd Graff) deserves a lot of credit for this.

The ludicrously lame sub-moniker should give you an idea of the level of intelligence you'll be dealing with if you decide to slog your way through this wretched mess, since the same minds who created this film also thought Your Sister Is A Werewolf was a good movie title. Amazingly enough, this isn't the worst name they came up with; their original idea was Stirba- Werewolf Bitch. Kind of sort of picking up where things left off, the action here begins at the funeral of Karen White (you won't recognize her because she's played by a stand-in; Dee Wallace wisely opted not to sully her good name by appearing in this), where we learn that she's not actually dead. Your Sister attempts to assert its originality by revising the guidelines of the lycanthropy mythology, and we're informed here that since the silver bullets were taken out of Karen's body during her autopsy, her werewolf super powers kicked in again and brought her back to life (conveniently, this doesn't happen until her coffin lid is closed after the memorial service, so there seems to be a few days of lag time on this go-go-resurrection). So, if we really think about this logically, that would mean that not only does every werewolf whose human body undergoes postmortem examination come back to life, but those who somehow get put into the ground without an autopsy or embalming taking place will have their skeletons rise from their graves after decomposition naturally removes the silver artifact that killed them from their flesh.But, wait... That's not the most fascinating addition the concussed film-makers cooked up for this feast of foolishness. You see, according to Howling II, the REAL way to kill a werewolf is to, of course, drive a stake through its heart (?!), and this is the method of dispatch which defeats several of the creatures we meet in this film. It gets better. The monstress queen's lair, where our heroes must travel to in order to rid the world of the lycan curse once and for all, is located in the place everyone immediately associates with werewolves Transylvania (??!!). Once the team of would-be werewolf slayers arrives and our female protagonist makes sure to point out that she brought cloves of garlic with her to protect them from the creatures, we have no choice but to wonder if director Philippe Mora even knew what movie he was making a sequel to.Oh, and by the way, werewolves apparently also have the ability to suck the souls out of human victims to rejuvenate themselves. And shoot lazers out of their fingers that make people's eyes burst out of their heads. And, yes, I'm completely serious.The creature FX range from serviceable to atrocious, and most of the monsters we see spend the film in a perpetual state of half-transformation, which is represented by clunky prosthetics that make them look more like puffy-faced apes than lupine shape-shifters; this impression is strengthened by the appearance of several of the fully formed beasts, whose bulbous, over-sized dimensions make it readily apparent that they're running around in modified gorilla costumes. This outing ramps up the gore and eroticism to make up for its sheer baffling inanity, so there is a lot more splatter and nudity on hand here than in the original Howling. If that sounds like an endorsement, go ahead and run with that, because it's the only thing close to one you'll find in this write-up.The inclusion of the great Christopher Lee should be a point of interest, but his scenes are actually heart-breaking to watch. Ever the gentleman, Lee demonstrates grace and professionalism throughout this farce, but it's patently obvious by his demeanor and general lack of enthusiasm how mortified he is to be tackling such insipid material.Miami Vice was the hottest show in the world when this was made, and, oddly, Howling II directly models entire sequences after that '80s staple. Any scene which features a car driving at night is shot and edited in a blatantly similar style, and the pulsing synth-rock soundtrack blaring in the foreground cements this homage. Unfortunately, the producers only sprang for one band to appear on the soundtrack and apparently only paid them for three songs; one of them is actually about werewolves, and you will have the dubious pleasure of hearing it over and over and over and over and over and over again throughout the film.If you find yourself wondering why Sybil Danning was afforded such prominent placement in this movie despite the fact that, as evidenced by her performance, she has trouble even forming a four-word sentence like Go get the girl, you'll get two reasons during her check THESE out scene, in which she tears her top off and exposes her breasts. The vital importance the film-makers place on this epochal shot is emphasized during the closing credits, where Danning's reveal is repeated precisely 17 more times (I counted).The two stars in my score are solely for Christopher Lee's presence and the film's ample allotment of diversionary bloodshed (okay, we'll throw Danning's boobs in there too). Everything else in Howling II from the stilted introduction to the hokey climax is simply abominable. I love bad movies as much as anyone, but this is just plain unbearable.

Nosferatu was directed by F.W. Murnau and starting Max Schreck as the Count Orlok. It's a chilling and eerie adaption of Stoker's Dracula, following the same plot somewhat and ever since it has first came to the screens in 1922, it has become a silent masterpiece of terror which to this day is the most striking and frightening portrayal of the legend. The old grainy black and white footage, and low frames per second recording somehow add to the creepiness of this film. Since it's public domain though, there have been several different re-releases over the years, a lot of which have music and voice overs that just seems out of place. It's hard to decide, when there is so many version of the film. There is a version where the music by Type O Negative&#x85;somewhere. Some of the campy music; there are moments when the tension of the music doesn't even fit what's happening on the screen. It's sad to watch. The original music was more Gothic in nature and better fit the feel for the movie. The music was originally composed by Hans Erdmann but the score was never recorded. This song is by far the greatest soundtrack to this movie! All the re-mastered versions suck! Not only did the remastered versions mess up the score, but also the picture by making it gold and blue. One problem in the film, is you can't really tell the different between night and day in this film&#x85; so it's better to have it black and white for the picture. W. Murnau originally filmed Nosferatu in a color tinted version not black and white, for instance Murnau shot the night scenes in a blue tint and the day ones in a gold tint which really works at the end of film with the rising of the sun. The Kino DVD of Nosferatu is really beautiful. It's amazing how great actors had to be, by telling the story by body expressing. Max Schreck acting in Nosferatu is chilling. The Orlok make-up is so timeless. He doesn't close his eyes at any time during the film, which I find rather creepy. He was an eccentric who took his parts so seriously he remained in character during the entire shoot. Max was already known for his quirky and often seen as weird or obscure habits. He was a loner who enjoyed playing grotesque characters and mainly lived in his own world. It's a trait that adds to Schreck's macabre appearance. The other actors acting are somewhat slow and awkward. Gustav v. Wangenheim is just awful as Hutter. Makes you appreciate this classic! Interesting thing is that the name credits in this B&W film at the beginning are a bit off because Murnau didn't use any of the character's names from the original Stoker novel when he filmed Nosferatu so Bram Stoker's widow wouldn't sue him and his company, (she did though) which is why in the original German titles you have names like 'Graff Orlock' instead of Count Dracula and 'Hutter' in place of Harker and 'Ellen' in place of Mina. Only very loosely based on Bram Stoker's novel, which, I guess would have been too complex to make a film of without dialogue - and is probably over-complex anyway. It's better than Dracula somewhat. Thank goodness that the widow of Bram Stoker couldn't burn all the film due to the suing of Nosferatu. We are lucky to see this film due to that. True horror enters the soul and disturbs us, like a insecure feeling of helplessness. This film holds those emotions after all these years, it still frightens many people.

The aspects of this movie which I appreciate are the plot (family in a haunted hotel), cinematography, background score, sound editing, direction & Jack Nicholson's maniac portrayal of the central character.Stephen king had chosen a perfect plot for his novel - isolated hotel, dark winter, no one to help, just the caretakers to deal with the supernatural and of course, with themselves. Gives me the shivers. The story and direction had a lot of grip and flow up to the point where Jack started to lose his mind (had a nightmare) - the build up was really nice. I have come to realize that the secret to a good mystery movie is if it continues to unravel bit by bit, but never giving the viewer the whole story, or the climax. As I said, the build up to the climax is critical. If it has a shocking end, all the more better. The shining had many such moments in the first half - psychic son, hotel with a murder history, a busy hotel suddenly shown as a big empty mansion, room 237 conversation between the cook and Danny, the twin girls being seen a couple of times and maybe a few more. This build-up was ably aided by haunting music & good camera-work. But somewhere the plot was lost. Some of the scenes were quite flimsy & cheesy for an audience like me - like the wave of blood coming from the lift and flowing across the lobby. Or the old lady with boils (or just bad skin) which Jack tried to kiss. Or Jack's multiple encounter with imaginary people, and maybe the real ghost of Delbert Grady. Such scenes actually led to more bitterness than pounding heartbeats. But nonetheless, Mr.Kubrick was successful in maintaining the plot based madness and continued it till the end. Maybe I wanted to get more chills.The background score, sound editing and the cinematography deserve a special mention. The background music was haunting for sure and added that extra dark-wintery feeling to the already freezing winter.The same played from the opening shot of car traveling in the mountains - beautiful scenery, haunting music. Did set the mood. The sound editing was fabulous. Its not like the clichéd tricks of sudden loud noises, but a potent combination of silence and background sound. The cinematography was classic horror style. Camera-work had this quality of making the viewer expect that there is something around the corner, which the camera will see at the same time as the character in the scene. It builds up the feeling of the unexpectedand magnifies the shock factor. Its a feeling which we all are familiar with when we close our eyes while watching a horror flick to avoid the shock. I know I did it a couple of times! The awesome co-ordination of sound editing and cinematography could be seen in a scene where the kid is riding his tri-cycle in empty corridors of the hotel - nice zippy work with just the background noise of tyres running on the wooden floor (and carpet) and camera behind the kid. Really thought the twins were just around the corner!All the above needed a central character for anchoring - Mr.Nicholson obliged. He is an artist who uses his face and various features in a brilliant manner. His expressive eyes, broad smile, ever moving eyebrows, deep crackling voice - all tools for a top class entertainer like Mr.Nicholson. He displayed cold frustration as effectively as outrageous anger. Portrayal of a frustrated madmen who slowly looses his mind was very detailed and must have resulted from a lot of homework.All in all, The shining had a lot of things which went right.

Camera-work had this quality of making the viewer expect that there is something around the corner, which the camera will see at the same time as the character in the scene. It builds up the feeling of the unexpectedand magnifies the shock factor. Its a feeling which we all are familiar with when we close our eyes while watching a horror flick to avoid the shock. I know I did it a couple of times! The awesome co-ordination of sound editing and cinematography could be seen in a scene where the kid is riding his tri-cycle in empty corridors of the hotel - nice zippy work with just the background noise of tyres running on the wooden floor (and carpet) and camera behind the kid. Really thought the twins were just around the corner!All the above needed a central character for anchoring - Mr.Nicholson obliged. He is an artist who uses his face and various features in a brilliant manner. His expressive eyes, broad smile, ever moving eyebrows, deep crackling voice - all tools for a top class entertainer like Mr.Nicholson. He displayed cold frustration as effectively as outrageous anger. Portrayal of a frustrated madmen who slowly looses his mind was very detailed and must have resulted from a lot of homework.All in all, The shining had a lot of things which went right. For 1980, Mr.Kubrick did deliver a never-seen-before cinematic horror experience. But maybe having seen current horror flicks like The Ring and The Grudge, I was expecting more chills. At the time of this review, IMDb rates The shining @ 8.5. I rate this as 7.5 ","genre":"Drama, Horror"},{"date":"18 October 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" A blend of comedy, drama and romance, Bull Durham follows the intertwining of three lives brought together by the great American pastime.

One would have expected THE WOMEN, with its depiction of upper-class wives as basically parasites who live off their husbands (and the alimony checks after the divorce), to have faded into oblivion years ago. That it has not is a tribute to director George Cukor, writers Clare Booth Luce and Anita Loos (and some sources say an uncredited F Scott Fitzgerald, among others), and a stellar cast of the biggest female stars in MGM's galaxy.Somehow, getting past the basic premise, which should have dated badly but somehow has not, is fairly easy, mainly because this movie is just so much fun. From Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard's infamous cat fight at the Reno ranch to Mary's (Shearer) attempts to be oh-so-noble about her failed marriage (drawing sharp criticism from her mother, who knows better but to whom she will not listen) to Joan Fontaine's simpering little mouse to what I consider the best performance in the whole thing Joan Crawford as the conniving, husband-stealing bitch Crystal Allen, an employee at the perfume counter at an upscale store who manages to wreck Mary's marriage and steal her husband, if only temporarily. Crawford only won one Oscar in her career, as the noble, self-sacrificing mother in MILDRED PIERCE, and her biographers have suggested that the Mildred role was how she saw herself, but I always liked her the best when she played a broad on the make, as in GRAND HOTEL and in this, possibly her best film role, and one which gave her one of the best exit lines ever written (see above).A lot has been said and written about the sexist nature of this film and the play upon which it was based, but Luce was writing of people she knew, and in those days a man who made or had serious money took care of his wife during their marriage and even after, so the film works, even today, I think, as a great comedy of manners that brilliantly spoofs upper class women with too much time on their hands and not enough scruples or ambition to actually DO anything themselves.I love this movie. Yes, it is sexist, and no, it could never work today (I know they remade it but I refuse to see it; the very idea is preposterous), but thanks to Cukor's skill in handling a cast that had not one man in the mix, THE WOMEN remains a classic comedy of manners with dialogue that will never go out of style.

Though it lost the race for the Best movie Oscar to The French Connection in 1972, I bellieve it could have gone either way - both being trendsetters & works of inspirational cinema.When I started the movie, the first shot really set my mood - The smirk on Alex's face, those eyes full of determination, hatred, scorn, revenge, unremitting, intense - just ripping through the viewer and sending a chilling message down the spine. Before Alex was imprisoned, Stanley Kubrick presented a theatrical piece of anarchy brought about in a devilish manner. Sometimes it felt like Nihilism and sometimes, just pure & unadultered paranoia. Malcom McDowell's portrayal of Alex's character must be commended - There was a sense of symphony to Alex and what he did, as if he was performing with the background music. It was like watching a concert.But the highlight of this movie was not the plot, but the theatrical extremities in which the cast portrayed their characters. This was brought together with detailed camera-work, background music, sets, artwork, make-up and symbolism. Specific sequences in the storyline helped in building up the feeling of hoodlumism and anarchy - billy & his boys raping a young girl, the garbage lying around when Alex was returning home from his evening odyssey, the vandalized art pieces, broken lift, artwork at the milkbar. Stanley Kubrick did well to create an atmosphere for Alex's delinquent behaviour. The background score added to the overall drama. Throughout the movie, most of the scenes had concert music in the background, even during acts of crime or action sequences - like when Alex and his droogs were beating Billy & his boys. When there was no music, there was silence with the dialogues echoing in the room, as if live theatre performances were getting delivered. It helped in building up the concert\/theatre feeling very nicely. Stanley Kubrick did well with artwork and make-up that denoted underlying sexuality and anarchism. Detailed creativity like Alex's eyelashes and the piece of art at the murdered lady's house are classic. The poster of clockwork where Alex is peeking out with his eyelashes & smirk, still gives me a quirky feeling. Knowing that Stanley himself was an avid photographer & knew all about cinematography, it isn't a surprise that in the credits under cinematography, John Alcott's name has been mentioned only as lighting cameraman. Stanley manipulated the camera-work that suited his style & which went with the movie's flavour - the close faceshots, camera-work from unique angles to shoot the characters.All in all, a clockwork orange is a masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick, in his long list of successful pieces of work. It is worth mentioning here that clockwork is by no means an easy film to watch and\/or understand, as many will be turned off by the explicit violence and rape. It'll make the viewer heavy-headed and leave the theatre in shock. But that was Mr.Kubrick's style afterall - Shock & Awe. This is a brand of cinema which'll live on for many years to come.Score - 8.5 out of 10. Definitely recommended if you have got a taste for drama.

Hannibal then cuts the top half of Krendlers skull off as he cuts off a part of his brain and serves it to Krendler.

But there is one thing about the film that bugs me and that is Juliane Moore as Clarice Starling.

Not in some re-release, but the real deal - my parents took me to see this during it's original release back when I was four or five years old. I can even remember where it was, the old Goshen Theater in Goshen, New York. So if you're reading this and know where I'm talking about, it would be cool to say hello.That was my prime motivation in watching this again, to see my first ever movie experience and share it with my granddaughter who's the same age now as when I first saw it. I can tell the magic works when she sits wide eyed and attentive, and gets a kick out of the same things I used to. It's weird the things you remember after a half century, like the words to the Siamese cat song; how does that work? That and things like The Tramp's pals Jock and Trusty.But nostalgia carries it only so far. Watching today I could enjoy the animation and vibrant use of color but the story itself seems a bit underdeveloped and simple. The sequence with the killer rat seemed a little too far fetched for me to accept, and the fast forward to Lady and the Tramp having their own family of pups huddled around the Christmas tree was out of synch with the rest of the story. Still it's a fun movie and ideal for the young and the young at heart. Walt Disney would have been proud to know his talent has reached across the generations to entertain one and all for so long after his passing.
