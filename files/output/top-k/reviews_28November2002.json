Ya gotta understand, with all the media-marketing hype and the terms family oriented and Kids Film I grew to dislike this film, without seeing it. That was until I saw it all the way through for the first time on cable tv. Lesson learned ignore the hype, view for yourself, make up your own mind.That's when I found out, this is a wonderful film for children, families and adults. Smart, witty and funny, a brilliant re-tread of fairy tales that will live on for a long time, to be included with all those other well-known timeless fairy tales.Shrek the Ogre, as voiced by Mike Myers was wonderful. He had all the elements, kids like. He's gross, he's loud, he's green and ugly. But he also possessed many traits adults liked, he was valiant and he had a heart. Everything a movie hero is made up of!I'm with everyone here as I cannot stop loving Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy. He should have won an Oscar for this. His vocal comedic stylings with this animation was brilliant, you cannot help but love Donkey.Princess Fiona, voiced by Cameron Diaz, was also wonderful and who could forget, Lord Farquaad voiced by the ever talented John Lithgow. I cannot tell you how hard I laughed throughout this film...and I loved the ending...I loved the twist of Princes Fiona and how, at least in this telling of the beautiful Princess fairy-tale story, beauty and love is in the eyes of the beholder.This film is a Dreamworks animation division triumph. Mr. Katzenberg out did himself in producing this one, an excellent choice and project well done. The Animation was superb. For those who don't believe me, take a look at Donkey during the film, or Lord Farquaad's hair for example. This type of Computer Animation is so scary, you just KNOW real actors now have a shelf life and in the coming decades, this technology will advance and become a Hollywood norm. Good or bad as this shelf life for real actors may be, I am just commenting on what a great accomplishment, great entertainment and I hope as the technology progresses, it is used with and not instead of.Anyone who hates this film, in my humble view, has a personal problem with it..because as far as an achievement, it is a great one, it is a spectacular film for all audiences -- loaded with adult jokes but in keeping it in line for children, which keeps everyone interested and very much entertained.

Movie producers take note, this is the way to make a film. I believe Hannibal should be a benchmark for the future production of films.I was not a big fan of Silence Of The Lambs but Hannibal just entertained me thoroughly-I am just glad I wasn't eating anything whilst watching it.Anthony Hopkins is back as Hannibal Lecter and he is extremely convincing in the role (perhaps too convincing). Julianne Moore takes on the role of Agent Clarice Starling and does just a good a job as Jodie Hopkins. Giancarlo Giannini does a wonderful job as Inspector Pazzi who matches wits with Hannibal (if you can match wits with an intellect like Hannibal). I must also mention Ray Liotta who plays a bureaucratic government pencil pusher called Paul Krendler.The first half of the film is slow but I think this helps rather than hinders the film. Slow spots in a film are sometimes crucial to maximizing the effect of the storyline later. Every good film and book has slow spots to balance out the action or horror.Giancarlo Giannini has the screentime for the first half as he engages in a battle of wits with the wicked but intelligent Hannibal and the scenes-although slow-are superb.The second half of the film finds Hannibal back in the United States where he continues his bizzare relationship with Agent Starling. The relationship between Hannibal and Starling is indeed one of the most bizzare relationships ever on screen. Both are very convincing in their roles.Let us not forget Gary Oldman as Mason Verger, one of Hannibal's early victims who is now disfigured (his face will give you nightmares so those of a nervous disposition close your eyes when he comes on). Mason originally gives Starling a lead on Hannibal but we soon find out what his real agenda is. It's hard at first to know whether to feel sympathy or disdain for Mason.The script is fantastic and as I said earlier, the slow parts help rather than hinder the movie. The tension is amazing between Inspector Pazzi and Hannibal and Starling\/Hannibal.The film is very powerful and effective although it does leave a bad taste in the mouth a few days after viewing with three truly disturbing scenes.The first scene shows a flashback to Mason Verger becoming a victim to Hannibal and it is unpleasant. The second disturbing scene involves some wild razorback pigs and Hannibal and Mason Verger. This is a powerful scene that will shock you. Something happens to Mason Verger which is really awful and at this point, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for him. The third and possibly most disturbing scene involves Hannibal and someone's brain. I won't spoil it-watch the film.This is an intense film because I think it is realistic. My personal feelings about any type of serial killer is that we should ignore their existence and not glamourize them. However, in real life that is rarely the case and people do build up a rapport with killers like Hannibal. The most interesting thing in the film is the relationship between Agent Starling and Hannibal. Underneath, there is clearly respect even though they are two different breeds.The other interesting thing about this movie is how everything is not black and white. A lot of people who see this film find themselves siding with the very guy we should be booing-I guess that says a lot about us humans. Hannibal could well be considered an anti-hero in these films whilst the 'good guys' pursuing him are often looked on as the villains.All in all, a masterpiece even though it leaves a bad taste in the mouth for days.

I was too old for those cutie Disney Animated cartoons of that time, and too young for the adult theme films that were being advertised which I DID want to see. This is why I like this film, it brings back the genre for children, the wonder, the fantasy in film just for them.A nice effort production wise, with the casting, with the story. Children love fantasy, wonder, adventure, a character THEIR age doing and thinking like THEY would and...watching kids eat lots of sweets. This Harry Potter film fit the bill. For me as an adult, it was...nice. For children between 7 and 12, its fantastic. The special effects were neat, the story was engaging for them, but what I liked the best was the school itself. I thought that the classes and interactions of the children with each other were on their level. So it was at a Wizards school. Point is, it could be at ANY school. (or boarding school!)In my surroundings, there have been a few adults\/parents screaming about how this film and the school Hogwarts promotes kids to get into the black arts. I think that is so awful to think that, and I think it does not give children the benefit of the doubt.

I was too old for those cutie Disney Animated cartoons of that time, and too young for the adult theme films that were being advertised which I DID want to see. This is why I like this film, it brings back the genre for children, the wonder, the fantasy in film just for them.A nice effort production wise, with the casting, with the story. Children love fantasy, wonder, adventure, a character THEIR age doing and thinking like THEY would and...watching kids eat lots of sweets. This Harry Potter film fit the bill. For me as an adult, it was...nice. For children between 7 and 12, its fantastic. The special effects were neat, the story was engaging for them, but what I liked the best was the school itself. I thought that the classes and interactions of the children with each other were on their level. So it was at a Wizards school. Point is, it could be at ANY school. (or boarding school!)In my surroundings, there have been a few adults\/parents screaming about how this film and the school Hogwarts promotes kids to get into the black arts. I think that is so awful to think that, and I think it does not give children the benefit of the doubt. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a nice little film about something a child\/pre-teen has fun with. I actually compared it to the Disney film Fantasia and the scene of Mickey being the Sorcerer's Apprentice. I watched that over and over as a 6 year old and trust me, I had no desire to get into the black arts.To me, this film is geared towards that audience that has been forgotten AND portrayed in the last 15 years, the 7 to 12 year olds. Yes, Disney had alot of animation that was marketed to that group of children, but its been quite sometime to make a long full length feature film of fantasy where children are the focus, and they are just...children. Reminds me of Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang...fantasy films for the 7 to 12 year old to enjoy the movie going experience on their level, but NOT talking DOWN to them.Children under 7 may be a bit scared at some parts and teens over 13 may not get into this film at all. But for the 7 to 12 year olds, this film is a nice one for them in the same vein as Oliver! and Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was for me.

To better understand my vantage point towards this film, you have to know that I've read 'The Lord of the Rings' many times over for the past twenty-one years, that, at age 14, it was one of the initial causes for my fascination with English language and literature (not my first language) and that I, as an avid cinephile have wondered many a time how this complex epic could ever be made into a movie worthy of its literary source. So, by having mulled over for some years, how the locations could look like on  film, who could be cast in the main roles, how the flow of the story could be arranged and which parts would have to be drastically cut for reasons of pacing, I did enter the cinema with a very clear picture, what was absolutely necessary for a decent adaptation, what was the maximum I could hope for, and where potential pitfalls might be lurking.After sitting through the prologue with its epic and action packed vista on the history of the ring giving way to the bucolic garden of the Shire, overwhelming joy was bubbling up inside me. This was exactly what I had hoped for, not only was the story represented in detail, the overall feeling of every scene was right on target, too.Among the highlights I have to mention are the grandiose and meticulously chosen location shots and the seamlessly worked effects representing the magical nature of the mythic world of Middle-Earth without distracting from the story. Nearly every picture in the film shows some sort of 'effect' but only in a precious few the first-time viewer becomes aware of it, and even then it blends in remarkably well. No less there have to be compliments to the astonishing depth of back story worked both into the script - often in an off-handed and almost imperceptible way - and into every prop and piece of decoration. The cultural representation of invented cultures in the film does put to shame every fantasy or sci-fi movie shot until now and many a period piece or historic drama based on real world cultures. Next there are the actors, every one of them cast and played exquisitely to represent the very distinct characters in the story, not always exactly according to the books and obviously not necessarily to everyone's taste, but always fully consistent internally and to its background story. Despite the big differences in experience and word count within the cast there is never any danger for the film to turn into a star vehicle, always putting the real stars, the ring, the fellowship and Tolkien's story, first.A lot of story elements from the book have been cut and even more have undergone changes big and small, but if one accepts Peter Jackson's right to alter peripheral parts of the narrative for dramatic reasons, the reasoning behind nearly every discrepancy has proven sound, prominently featuring both the wish to produce a movie appealing to fans and first-timers alike and the dramatic obligation to turn the often remote and epical characters of Tolkien's books into a full sensory presence of the big screen. And indeed, I do know of a lot of people never before in close contact with Tolkien's books, who came away from the film in awe and with respect for a genre they admitted to have gravely underestimated.Even if this appears to be hardly possible, the extended DVD version still improves on this work of art, adding a lot of scenes giving additional back story and a feel for the world of Middle-Earth and re-cutting action scenes to more streamlined and dramatic versions.So why do some people just don't seem to be able to see anything worthwhile in this movie? Clearly my taste isn't superior to theirs, but I would just venture the opinion that those people confronted the film with expectations it couldn't meet for perfectly good reasons. So let me tell you, this movie is not for you (and probably the second nor the third part of the story is neither), if you- just don't like the notion of Fantasy with its strange creatures, magic, outlandish names and tales of fate and heroics.- insist on scripts adapted from a novel to exactly mirror the book, and still more importantly your interpretation of it.- can't stand action scenes and staged battles or do like action movies to be nothing but.- find it disturbing to have the reality of evil and temptation portrayed intensely and neither cynical nor comical.- like to have your characters either one-dimensional or monologueing their thoughts to death in front of the camera.- take the point of view, that romance or humour are misplaced within films exhibiting a serious and dark mood.- feel betrayed by a story that moves somewhat unpredictably throughout the movie and doesn't tie up nicely at the end of the film either.- take offence at being forced to sit through a three hour screening.While I might come across as patronizing (because I have trouble appreciating these lines of thinking), I don't want to belittle the disappointment of anybody who didn't like the film. I just would like to give fair warning to anybody contemplating to view it at long last, to buy the DVD or to queue up for the upcoming parts. To all those able to overcome differing expectations and appreciate the lots of love, creativity and expertise the cast and the crew under Peter Jackson have poured into this adaptation, I just can say 'Have lots of unadulterated fun and awe.'

This was exactly what I had hoped for, not only was the story represented in detail, the overall feeling of every scene was right on target, too.Among the highlights I have to mention are the grandiose and meticulously chosen location shots and the seamlessly worked effects representing the magical nature of the mythic world of Middle-Earth without distracting from the story. Nearly every picture in the film shows some sort of 'effect' but only in a precious few the first-time viewer becomes aware of it, and even then it blends in remarkably well. No less there have to be compliments to the astonishing depth of back story worked both into the script - often in an off-handed and almost imperceptible way - and into every prop and piece of decoration. The cultural representation of invented cultures in the film does put to shame every fantasy or sci-fi movie shot until now and many a period piece or historic drama based on real world cultures. Next there are the actors, every one of them cast and played exquisitely to represent the very distinct characters in the story, not always exactly according to the books and obviously not necessarily to everyone's taste, but always fully consistent internally and to its background story. Despite the big differences in experience and word count within the cast there is never any danger for the film to turn into a star vehicle, always putting the real stars, the ring, the fellowship and Tolkien's story, first.A lot of story elements from the book have been cut and even more have undergone changes big and small, but if one accepts Peter Jackson's right to alter peripheral parts of the narrative for dramatic reasons, the reasoning behind nearly every discrepancy has proven sound, prominently featuring both the wish to produce a movie appealing to fans and first-timers alike and the dramatic obligation to turn the often remote and epical characters of Tolkien's books into a full sensory presence of the big screen. And indeed, I do know of a lot of people never before in close contact with Tolkien's books, who came away from the film in awe and with respect for a genre they admitted to have gravely underestimated.Even if this appears to be hardly possible, the extended DVD version still improves on this work of art, adding a lot of scenes giving additional back story and a feel for the world of Middle-Earth and re-cutting action scenes to more streamlined and dramatic versions.So why do some people just don't seem to be able to see anything worthwhile in this movie? Clearly my taste isn't superior to theirs, but I would just venture the opinion that those people confronted the film with expectations it couldn't meet for perfectly good reasons. So let me tell you, this movie is not for you (and probably the second nor the third part of the story is neither), if you- just don't like the notion of Fantasy with its strange creatures, magic, outlandish names and tales of fate and heroics.- insist on scripts adapted from a novel to exactly mirror the book, and still more importantly your interpretation of it.- can't stand action scenes and staged battles or do like action movies to be nothing but.- find it disturbing to have the reality of evil and temptation portrayed intensely and neither cynical nor comical.- like to have your characters either one-dimensional or monologueing their thoughts to death in front of the camera.- take the point of view, that romance or humour are misplaced within films exhibiting a serious and dark mood.- feel betrayed by a story that moves somewhat unpredictably throughout the movie and doesn't tie up nicely at the end of the film either.- take offence at being forced to sit through a three hour screening.While I might come across as patronizing (because I have trouble appreciating these lines of thinking), I don't want to belittle the disappointment of anybody who didn't like the film. I just would like to give fair warning to anybody contemplating to view it at long last, to buy the DVD or to queue up for the upcoming parts. To all those able to overcome differing expectations and appreciate the lots of love, creativity and expertise the cast and the crew under Peter Jackson have poured into this adaptation, I just can say 'Have lots of unadulterated fun and awe.'

Mr Morgan(Crisp)is the proud father of a hardworking mining patriarchy.  It is amazing how well Hollywood recreated the Welsh mining town where the story is set!  The new preacher Mr Gruffydd (Pidgeon)is well liked and especially by Angharad(O'Hara)and young Huw Morgan(McDowall).  Unfortunately the son of the mine owner is set to marry her, and she cannot refuse, so she is miserable in a loveless marriage. The soundtrack is beautiful, and the miners' continual singing throughout provide a moving framework for their spirit and suffering.  Huw is small and smart, so will become a doctor. He and Mrs Morgan have fallen in the frozen water and are rescued after she confronts them for their rough ways, but they are bedridden for months. They tap hello with their canes, Mr Gruffydd visits, and lovely Bronwyn reads him from Robert Louis Stevenson, so they both recover.  A very touching scene comes when spring is here and Huw looking out the window observes that the daffodils are in bloom. Mr Gruffydd takes him out and teaches him to walk again, among the daffodils.  Then later Huw gets beat up at the neighboring school and becomes a man there, and the scholar decides that before college he wants to go down into the colliery, just like his father and brothers did.  He gets beat up again defending his sister's honor.  Then they lose their jobs to neighbors, the mine blows up and Dada and Ivor Morgan get killed.  Some hard lessons here, but that is how it was.

Andrew Dufresne, a fairly young man committed murder and was sentenced to life in Shawshank prison.  There are some elements of this film that differ from elements of this novel.  And yet many things are the same.In the novel, Andy was a short, partially bald man, who was quiet and shy, and in the movie he was a tall intimidating stocky figure.  I think this difference is important in one particular scene the prisoners are tarring the roof, and Andy overhears Hadley, a man who is angry at the world, talking about his inheritance from his deceased brother.  Andy speaks up about the taxes of the inheritance and Hadley gets furious.  I think that if in the movie he was the man described in the book, it would have made this seem weak, and Hadley probably wouldn't have thought him worthy to even speak to him. I think this movie was put together well, but to be honest, I like Stephen King's short novel better.Review by Steve The movie was very good.  Andy's life in prison was real.  Andy really got cheated out of 20 years of his life.  Andy's in jail for something he didn't do. I especially like the scene when the warden was talking to the media. When the warden was in front of the building talking it looked like the warden had a crown on.  Showing that he was a king he had all the power. I didn't like the ending of the movie.  It was good for them because it was what they both wanted. They both wanted freedom and that's what that scene showed.  But they should have had some sort of action, like gone sailing, fishing, showed them both out to sea doing something.  Being free.  Not just on the beach hugging each other.Review by Derek I think that the directors should have filmed the movie in Charleston, Maine because I've spent a lot of time there.  I wish I would have had a chance to see the whole movie but from what I saw it was a great movie. I liked the movie cause it seemed so real.  But what I didn't like was how the guards and the warden thought that any one who got in the way or their business they could kill them or put them in solitary confinement.  Plus I didn't like how guards treated inmates like slaves. They couldn't just face reality and treat them like equals. But it happens in prisons all over the world so that's why I liked Shawshank Redemption.Review by Brad I liked the movie compared to the book.  I think that the movie was way better. The movie seemed to be way more interesting.  It was complimentary to Stephen King's ways of writing an intricate portrayal of an actual event that took place in Maine. One of the things I liked about the movie is the way camera angles portray power.Review by Dan A Review of Shawshank Redemption from an Inmate's View I found the movie not nearly as enjoyable as Stephen King's `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'.  The points I found I did not agree with are they have Red's character as a black man in the movie when in the short story he was a white Irish man but it kinda adds a little laughter to a serious theme.  Second they have Andy Dufresne as a tall skinny man when in `Rita Hayworth.' he's a small and a heavy man with not much of an aura. Thirdly they have one warden Mr. Norton when there is three in the short story because it seems to the viewer that 19 years did not go by, but in a way its good so the viewer can focus his hate towards one figure. That's what I didn't like but there are more pros than cons.  The film makers did an excellent job with the lighting, the angle of the camera and the music. With these three combined it gives the feelings of dread and despair as black as death.  Freedom as high as a bird and sadness as deep as an ocean. With all these in mind it makes a great movie on a scale from 1 to 10 I'd give it 8 ½.Review by Chris This movie was madcool. Some specific parts about this movie that I thought were pretty phat was like when the music was played by the Italian lady's singing and they all looked free.  When later on in the movie the music is really fast and strong after he's finished climbing out of the pipe and really is free.  I also like how Andy never gave up against the sisters and then finally Hadley beat the p*** out of Boggs,the guards helped him because he helped them that's pretty killer.Madcool-really good, very interesting Phat-cool interesting, awesome, madcool Pretty Killer-same ","genre":null},{"date":"28 November 2002","score":"","review":"  CONTAINS SPOILERS Review by Joe `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' the original short novel by legendary author Stephen King, sparked the start of a superb movie and ongoing legend.

With these three combined it gives the feelings of dread and despair as black as death.  Freedom as high as a bird and sadness as deep as an ocean. With all these in mind it makes a great movie on a scale from 1 to 10 I'd give it 8 ½.Review by Chris This movie was madcool. Some specific parts about this movie that I thought were pretty phat was like when the music was played by the Italian lady's singing and they all looked free.  When later on in the movie the music is really fast and strong after he's finished climbing out of the pipe and really is free.  I also like how Andy never gave up against the sisters and then finally Hadley beat the p*** out of Boggs,the guards helped him because he helped them that's pretty killer.Madcool-really good, very interesting Phat-cool interesting, awesome, madcool Pretty Killer-same ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"28 November 2002","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  CONTAINS SPOILERS       Scotty Smalls was new to the neighborhood.

Surprisingly, it's the only Hitchcock movie ever to win an Oscar and a truly cinema classic, besides one of his best movies from the Selznick period (the other being the amazing Notorius; but I digress again).Ok, I'll focus in the movie.

While many people have complained about the ambiguous ending, it gives room for the audience to think and interpret it from the signs. This is my interpretation and theory, and I believe it is very sound. First, here is the plot. One day, Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the midst of a busy train station. After attempting to help a woman from muggers, he is arrested and sent to Bellevue, and later transferred to Dr. Mark Powell's (Jeff Bridges) hospital. Prot freely talks about how he came from the planet K-Pax and is here to do a report on Earth. Naturally, he is classified as a looney and is locked up in a low security level ward. He befriends the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story. In fact, he tells them he can take one person back with him. Soon Dr. Powell is beginning to question Prot's insanity and as the plot progresses, it is harder and harder to prove Prot wrong. In the end, Dr. Powell learns that Prot is Robert Porter, a smart man who worked in a slaughter house in New Mexico, when his wife and daughter were murdered. Prot claims that he plans to leave for K-Pax at a precise time on the fifth anniversary of the murders. The time comes and goes, and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients is missing and is never found again. On to my theory Prot is not crazy. Prot is from the planet K-Pax. Robert Porter is a friend of Prot's. On one of Prot's previous visits to Earth, Robert was a child, learning about the constellations from his father. Prot and Robert became best friends. After the death of his family, and Robert slaying the murderer, Robert decides to commit suicide. Prot is on K-Pax at the time, but he rushes back (in multiples of light speed) to stop Robert. So Prot takes over the thinking of Robert, taking over his body so to speak. Awhile later, Prot (still inhabiting Robert's body) comes to New York and is locked up. When he leaves for K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him, but he must leave Robert's body behind. Hence, we now have the catatonic Robert.Explanations or cluesPROT'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANETS AROUND LIBRA As Prot says, any child knows about their own system. Only a few people on Earth had an inkling about the system, and Prot added to their knowledge. Robert Porter, while smart and knows his constellations, was no astro-physicist. DR POWELL FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT It's true. Prot could've left the institute at any time, but chose not too. Prot's last words to Dr. Powell are, Now that you've found Robert. Take care of him. Prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for Robert when he left. SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot provides his usual K-Pax reason, but there was no Earthly reason given. It was also mentioned that Prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect.HELPING THE PATIENTS Throughout the movie, you see Prot helping the other patients (or the patients discussing Prot's suggestions) to a better sane world. While the psychologist balk at Prot's help, Dr. Powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading.THE SPRINKLER SCENE The sprinkler is associated with Porter's home in New Mexico (which is ironically where Roswell is). Does Porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family? Is her trying to protect Powell's daughter from that horrible fate? I have a different point of view. It is assumed that Porter had committed suicide in a river. Indeed, Prot (under hypnosis) is greatly concerned about Robert. I believe that Prot associates the danger with the water, not the sprinkler. He is trying to protect the girl from watery death, like he did Robert.HYPNOSIS Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover Prot's true identity, but while Prot gives plenty of information, he never gives up his Prot persona and claimed homeland of K-Pax.THE SECURITY CAMERA Why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason? MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES First, Prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north. Funny, the patients are not at all alarmed. Indeed, they try to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff. Naturally, the most telling disappearance is of Bess, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does she disappear at the approximate same time, but the only remaining clue is her winning essay.This is only my humble theory. You can conclude what you want.

Well, get ready to change your view of these ancient creatures.Dragons, the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs, have been in slumber for centuries.  (As a previous review pointed out, why no fossel record of them is just one of several major plot holes that I see in the story.) With the reawakening of the only male of the species, all hell breaks loose on earth.  Dragons, we learn, live on ash, and produce fire by secreting liquid from two glands in their mouth.  When these two liquids mix, you have instant napalm which is then ejected from the dragon's mouth.  Within 10 years, humanity is reduced to small pockets fighting to survive as the onslaught of the dragons continue.In this setting, we find Christian Bale leading a group of adults and children in a run down castle stuck out in the middle of nowhere.  (Maybe it's just me, but if I was afraid of being attacked by creatures that ruled the sky, why keep myself and my people holed up in a castle with no real defenses?  And what's with the garden being so far away from the castle?) Into the delicate balance that Bale has formed with his people marched Matthew McConaughey.  Gone are his golden locks and good-boy looks from pervious films.  This McConaughey is dark, buffed, shaved head, and covered in tatoos.  McConaughey plays a US citizen who leads a group of dragon fighters who managed to get a plane across the Atlantic and landed in a field nearby Bale's castle.  Their goal is to get to London to destroy the one male that is populating the species (more on this later).Other than the incredible dragon effects, the weight of the story is strongest when you view the interaction between Bale and McConaughey. Both are leaders but both have different styles of leadership.  Bale is leader by default.  He is rather uncharasmatic and leads simply because no one else seems to want the job.  McConaughey leads by example, and by his own inner fire to see the beasts totally destroyed.  During their interaction, we see some signs of story growth.  After McConaughey's team has been destroyed by a dragon attack, he is left with just himself, his pilot and Bale to sneak into London, find the big Bull, and destroy it.  They have one axe, three crossbows, three arrows, and a couple of rifles.  With an obvious blue screen attack, McConaughey gets eaten by the dragon early in the fight. This leaves Bale to finish him off.  With the great Bull dragon dead, the species will die out.The focus of the dialogue between McConaughey and Bale is on leadership...which has the best plan for the future of their peoples and how to merge them into one strong group.  Since both leaders loose most of their followers in two different dragon attacks, the question of which leadership type if best is left unanswered.  One could argue that Bale's was the best since he survied the attach, but this argument falls when one remembers how McConaughey died.Plot holes involving the dragons are abundant.  For example, McConaughey believes that the dragons reproduce in the same way as fish.  The female lays eggs and they are fertalized by the one male.  However, this view is contradicted by Bale when he pulls out a dragon egg from a dead female and inside the egg is a dragon embryo.  Bale never bothers to share this information with McConaughey.  Why?Also, the theory that only one male is populating the species does not have much weight when you consider one question...how does this one male keep other males from being born?  If you say that female dragons can only have female babies, then where did the one male come from?  To spend so much time on developing the relationship between the two major characters, and such expense in developing the dragons, to not answer these basic questions makes the movie empty.As a character study in leadership, see the film.

MANY SPOILERS BELOW!!!!! *************From the opening scene, the movie is loaded with incongruities and events that didn't even happen in the book.  Worse still was the fact that many, many parts of the book - events that were central to the storyline - were either completely changed or left out altogether.For instance, in the book Mercedes waits for YEARS before she finally succumbs to Fernands advances.  In the book, Dantes' revenge is not only aimed at those who sent him to prison, but at Mercedes as well.  Although in the book he does not carry out nearly as harsh of a punishment against her, Mercedes life as a countess is dashed against the rocks.  Her and her son are stripped of their riches and are forced to live a life of poverty. Mercedes' son Albert is NOT the son of Dantes in the book.  Although Albert and Dantes NEARLY get into a swordfight in the book... it is due to a duel that Albert proposes after Dantes ruins his father(Danglar).Which brings us to another casual change in the book.  Danglar is NOT the first mate on the Phaeron.  He is the bursar.  He is never in any position to have command authority over Dantes even though he exclaims in the opening scene that Dantes disobeyed his orders.Fernand is not killed in a swordfight.  He kills himself after his life is ruined by the Count of Monte Cristo's careful scheming.  Jacobo is in a small part of the book but by no means is he the counts loyal servant throughout the story.  The way he is picked up by the smugglers is completely different in the book as well.  These examples go on and on throughout the movie.  Heck, there is even a huge part of the book that is totally left out of the movie.Instead of being a classy visual representation of one of the most prolific stories ever to be written, the movie comes off as a cheap equivalent of the summary you would find in Cliff's notes.  Do yourself a favor... if you liked the movie and havent read the book - don't.  It will only make you realize how stupid the movie is.One last thing.  I find it very amusing that on the DVD the director has a special area in which he defends, err... explains his decisions.  I have never seen another movie where this happens.  Its almost like he is acknowledging how badly he screwed up the plot.  And hey... if anyone would know, it would be the director.
