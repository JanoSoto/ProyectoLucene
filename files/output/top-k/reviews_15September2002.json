It's a tad clichéd (look mommy - the man has learnt a valuable lesson) but not to the point of irritation and the action is never left out long enough to make you into Billy Bored.Acting? Well Matthew hasn't quite found his wings here yet but does a passable job. Bill Paxton is good, but not in it long.

Mr. Salva obviously doesn't have a sister, and if he ever did, he must have never spoken to her in his life, because his portrayal of a family dynamic is about as far from realistic as it gets.  The movie actually makes you WANT to see these brats eaten, if only to stop their incessant whining.  These are not protagonists you care about.  If you find you have any emotional connection with these characters at all, it is, without exception a seething, burning hate.  However, the audience, is inevitably robbed of any catharsis at the end, because even though somebody dies, it's done in the absolute worst scene caught on film. You can't even enjoy their death because you just feel dirty after sitting through it.  Suffice to say, the ending is a travesty. And for a real treat, rent the DVD with the alternate ending.  I honestly didn't think it was possible, but it's actually worse.  MUCH worse.  That's like finding out that Charles Manson spends his down-time kicking puppies.As for the Monster, well, the thing just doesn't make much sense.  You can design the spookiest monster in the world, but it doesn't make much difference if you have it doing Matrix-type ninja moves.  That's like Freddy Kruger using a pistol.  It just doesn't work.

For two reasons. I have lost faith in the action genre and haven't seen an action film on screen in a while. Secondly Vin Diesel doesn't really appeal to me as an actor. Yet more like a guy that attracts the girls to the cinemas, while the girls Ooooh and Ahhhh at his biceps, triceps and abs. The introduction starts off with action, thats a pretty good way to start an action film isn't it?? With some action.One thing that i really DEMAND in a lot of films is realism. Most action films are MUCH MORE than a stone throw away from reality. XXX doesn't differ, infact this goes the extra mile in terms of UNrealism. The Art Of War (Wesley Snipes) was so unrealistic, that i dropped it automatically as an action film. XXX wasn't Action packed, yet it was adequate. The acting was acceptable, I liked the female accomplice in the movie. The accents were a nice touch, as the film was shot in the lovely city of Prague. The soundtrack, although suiting to the film wasn't my style. Some great special effects were also used in the film, the Avalanche scene being one of the greatest.Without giving too much away i would really reccomend you watch XXX, the film has such a great aura, although terribly unrealistic, there are many things which FORCE you to like the film. The Cinematography was magical, the writing was good, Sound effects were top notch. One must give in to the Extreme Excitement of XXX.ACTING Acceptable. Vin Diesel never really Acted. He always seems to be the same character (Fast And the Furious). The other cast acted fairly enough, i liked Jelena. She was probably the best of all in the film, not to mention Samuel L. Jackson who adds a few laughs to the film. Nothing to go on about, i doubt any Oscars will be won.ACTORS An adequate selection of actors. The film was shot in Prague, Czech Republic. So we didn't exactly see a lot of famous faces. Yet most notably was Vin Diesel and Samuel L. Jackson who play their characters pretty well.SCRIPT The script was fine.The lines sometimes are Corny, yet they add to the whole fun of the movie. The plot though wasn't very well....interesting.

It's all beautifully shot, i couldn't have asked for any better, honestly some of the best cinematography, much better than any Bond film in terms of Cinema.ACTION As i said, the film wasn't Action Packed. It was mediocore on levels of violence and blood. I wouldn't think of comparing this to other hardcore action films. It was quiet clean, yet still was loads of fun. The Intro was fine, and Vin Diesel had some intense situations. I really enjoyed the Sky Diving, Snow Boarding and Motorbike riding, lots of XXXtreme Sports.MUSIC\/SOUND The music went well with the medieval atmosphere yet it wasn't my style. Very heavy metal.

I was happy.OVERALL I would rather watch this than any 007 film. The movie is actually quiet addictive. It's fast paced, loads of fun and REALLY unrealstic.

And believe it or not, there is a good deal of blacks who are very wealthy and work in big business.  This movie plays against all the stereotypes. And that's what I found fascinating.  None of that cheesy, exploitative White people bad\/Black people good crap.  Though Harry Belafonte's character is a close-minded racist in the beginning, he develops a healthy friendship with John Travolta as the film goes on and eventually he changes his views.  Just like some white people should realize that not all black people are low-class idiots, some blacks should realize that not all whites are high-class snobs.  There is no such thing as a superior race.Travolta and Belanfonte give splendid performances.  This is a fine example of Travolta's versatility as an actor.  He doesn't just play the smooth-talking, chain-smoking villain.  This is obviously a low-budget film, so I imagine Travolta didn't get paid much to do this movie.  Kelly Lynch is compelling as his wife, and there's a very disturbing scene in which she's forced by two cops to change clothes in front of one of them.WMB has a good message, but doesn't deliver it in a melodramatic, in-your-face fashion.  It's a brutal, realistic, touching character study that I think most people should check out.  It's one of those overlooked films that really deserved more attention.My score  7 (out of 10)       ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"15 September 2002","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  If you're a fan of comic books or comic book movies, then please disregard my comments.

Joan is glamorous, witty, loves acting, loves her cat and never stops talking. Mostly she talks about herself. At a club she spots Keenan, a boy with blue hair and hard eyes. One of the first things he tells her is he doesn't date. Sure thing Joan says But if you want, meet me at the cinema tomorrow. But it wont be a date if you don't want to. And what do you know he actually shows up! But Keenan is a boy with secrets. He won't tell Joan what has happened to him, so she assumes he's been ditched by the girl he loved. She's close to the truth, but she could by no means ever emagine what Keenan has gone thrue.**WARNING SPOILERS!!**My God! The scene where Keenan tells Joan the reason he hardly ever smiles and is persuaded he will never be alowed to love again is one of the strongest scenes in movie history! I cried a lot over this young couple's destiny. I cried because it was so unfair that they, so in love and so happy, were going to be punished for something someone else did. How unfair isn't the world when a young guy like Keenan is given HIV by his unfaithful girlfriend, and is therefor going to be ripped away from the girl he loves. Twice! First his girlfriend dies and then he is going to die and leave Joan alone here to grief. And the s***tiest part of it all is that it happens every day, all over the world!Both Ryan Philippe and Angelina Jolie are magnificent in this movie. Especially Jolie surpasses almost all of her co-stars. She is truly amazing; something I thought I'd never say about her. All in all this is a great movie. I guess that it wants to leave you with a feeling of hope. Hope in life and love and humans, but it actually mostly left me with the feeling of why is this world so unfair?!Watch it if you can.

Hugh Grant is once again brilliant in a film that shows how complex and easy it can be to commit to someone. This is another one of those funny British films of our time that both men and women should appreciate. Will is a 38-year-old rich, child-free, hip and irresponsible Londoner. Will spends most of his time hanging out at restaurants and dating women with no intention of committing to a permanent relationship. After a fling with a single mother, he discovers that a good place to meet women is at single-parent help groups. Inventing a toddler son called Ned, he joins a local group and is well on the way to seducing Susie, when he meets 12-year-old Marcus, the son of Susie's friend Fiona. After this, Will's life changes in many different ways. It has been along time since I have seen a movie quite like &#145;about a boy'. I really enjoyed the storyline, although I warn that it is complicated for one of a better word. I found the way the story was told, by both the acting and the voiceovers of the two main characters to be excellent. This aspect to the film was not only funny, but also original, as not many films dictate what should be happening, while the opposite is actually happening. Most of the credit for the way this and the whole movie was put forward must got to both the directors, the Weitz brothers, Paul and Chris. Considering that the two had a part in the outrageous &#145;American Pie' movie(s), I felt they both did an extremely good job with &#145;about a boy'.Then what about the cast of this film! Hugh Grant has had a funny career, with of course his big hits being &#145;Notting Hill' and &#145;Bridget Jones Diary'. Yet in this, he is given a very diverse and complex character to play. Not only is he a very boring person, he is a nobody. He wants no part in a committed relationship, believing that &#145;it is not for me'. He rather enjoys toying with many women's emotions. Grant was born for this role of Will, a single bloke who wants no commitment, to spoil what he thinks is a perfect life. Yet his character learns plenty from a young and &#145;down and out', 12 year old Marcus. In fact they both teach each other important values for life. Marcus tries to help Will grow up and be a real man, and commit to a woman, while Will attempts to show Marcus what it means to be &#145;cool'. Acting newcomer Nicholas Hoult plays Marcus. I found him to be of great value to this film, as he brings out the good in Will. In addition he does a wonderful job in his first movie role. The way both Nicholas and Grant perform onscreen together was another highlight for me. I must not forget the other great members to this cast. Aussie Toni Collette is great as the depressed mother of Marcus. The way she portrays Fiona, is so frighteningly good. Trust me I know what it is like to feel as Fiona did in this film! In fact her role brings back memories of her character in the &#145;Sixth Sense'. I also found the small performance by Rachel Weisz suited this film well. Her character is of great importance to the balance of the story being presented.I would also like to point out that &#145;about a boy' poses some important values for its audience. Yes, most men can be like &#145;islands' and they can be scared to commit and love women as they are. It is important to not let someone slip away or for something to stuff you up, when that is the last thing you really want. Both of the main characters show this to be so true.So please watch &#145;about a boy', learn from it, be touched by it and laugh at it. All of these components are crucial to the film, making it one of my favourite films of this year.

After a fling with a single mother, he discovers that a good place to meet women is at single-parent help groups. Inventing a toddler son called Ned, he joins a local group and is well on the way to seducing Susie, when he meets 12-year-old Marcus, the son of Susie's friend Fiona. After this, Will's life changes in many different ways. It has been along time since I have seen a movie quite like &#145;about a boy'. I really enjoyed the storyline, although I warn that it is complicated for one of a better word. I found the way the story was told, by both the acting and the voiceovers of the two main characters to be excellent. This aspect to the film was not only funny, but also original, as not many films dictate what should be happening, while the opposite is actually happening. Most of the credit for the way this and the whole movie was put forward must got to both the directors, the Weitz brothers, Paul and Chris. Considering that the two had a part in the outrageous &#145;American Pie' movie(s), I felt they both did an extremely good job with &#145;about a boy'.Then what about the cast of this film! Hugh Grant has had a funny career, with of course his big hits being &#145;Notting Hill' and &#145;Bridget Jones Diary'. Yet in this, he is given a very diverse and complex character to play. Not only is he a very boring person, he is a nobody. He wants no part in a committed relationship, believing that &#145;it is not for me'. He rather enjoys toying with many women's emotions. Grant was born for this role of Will, a single bloke who wants no commitment, to spoil what he thinks is a perfect life. Yet his character learns plenty from a young and &#145;down and out', 12 year old Marcus. In fact they both teach each other important values for life. Marcus tries to help Will grow up and be a real man, and commit to a woman, while Will attempts to show Marcus what it means to be &#145;cool'. Acting newcomer Nicholas Hoult plays Marcus. I found him to be of great value to this film, as he brings out the good in Will. In addition he does a wonderful job in his first movie role. The way both Nicholas and Grant perform onscreen together was another highlight for me. I must not forget the other great members to this cast. Aussie Toni Collette is great as the depressed mother of Marcus. The way she portrays Fiona, is so frighteningly good. Trust me I know what it is like to feel as Fiona did in this film! In fact her role brings back memories of her character in the &#145;Sixth Sense'. I also found the small performance by Rachel Weisz suited this film well. Her character is of great importance to the balance of the story being presented.I would also like to point out that &#145;about a boy' poses some important values for its audience. Yes, most men can be like &#145;islands' and they can be scared to commit and love women as they are. It is important to not let someone slip away or for something to stuff you up, when that is the last thing you really want. Both of the main characters show this to be so true.So please watch &#145;about a boy', learn from it, be touched by it and laugh at it. All of these components are crucial to the film, making it one of my favourite films of this year. Also if you are single and have someone special in your life, take a chance with him or her, as you might regret not doing this for the rest of your life. CMRS gives &#145;about a boy' 4 (very good film) ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"15 September 2002","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Before I saw this movie, what I had heard about it was comments comparing it to porno in the sense that the storyline is only there to provide some kind of back-up to Tom Greens vulgar feats. Although it is not too far off, that description is a bit harsh in my opinion. The film concetrates on the storyline which consists of Gord Brody's (Tom Green) struggle to accomplish his dream of being a pro animator. Currently he is nothing but a 28-year old sandwich-flipping loser still living with his parents.Since this is Tom Green we are talking about here, he flips out into obscenities even more frequent then he is flipping cheese. Everything you would expect from this guy is here, difference being that this time he exposes his fellow cast members instead of regular people like in the Tom Green show.I am not a fan of Tom Green although he does occationally give me a laugh or two, but I cannot stand his constant screaming aggressions which makes him look more of a mental patient than a comedian in my eyes. But if that is your cup of tea, then there you go, he does not stop the screaming on the big screen, I tell you.Even though I think Tom Green is OK, this movie really told me nothing. In fact, it is almost entirely forgotten after just a couple of hours since my viewing. But if you're a fan of Tom Green, then give this movie a go.
