Reason being, that I'm a big fan of the MGM-version and generally consider remakes somewhat unnecessary. But when I finally got around to watch the film, I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least.Thanks to prior films with Clark Gable or Marlon Brando, the perceptions of the mutiny (and especially the ill-fated captain) have been a little one-sided, if not biased. Captain Bligh is generally perceived as a ruthless tyrant, Fletcher Christian as a noble, justice-seeking soul and the mutiny itself as completely justified. The Bounty takes a slightly different take. There is no good guys versus bad guys-mentality. All the characters are somewhat flawed, which makes them all too human. Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) is essentially an idealist, generally a fair man, but completely overtaken by his sense of duty and puritanical background (in reality Bligh was said to have been a captain who, unlike most contemporaries, would reprimand, where other captains would whip and whip where other captains hang misfits). Treating his crew harsh seems almost a panic reaction of a man who fears that he might loose control over his mission. Christian (Mel Gibson) on the other hand is the mirror-image of Bligh A happy-go-lucky youngster, who &#x96; like most sailors &#x96; cares less about the mission or social-justice, and more about his woman on Tahiti. Same goes for the rest of the mutineers, more or less scoundrels, who care less about their duties and more about living the hedonistic lifestyle. It is hence understandable that the real story didn't come to a happy-end; a few years after having settled on Pitcairn Island, most of the crew had decimated itself with drink and violent murder (even today, despite its sparse population, the island is plagued by a high rate of sexual assault).That said The cinematography of The Bounty is excellent and the atmosphere so authentic, that one can really imagine what it must have been to be a sailor of the time. The actors are altogether superb; only Daniel Day-Lewis is a little wasted as John Fryer and Mel Gibson, still being young and rather inexperienced, relies more on his charm and good looks rather than his (still limited) acting-skills. From the point of the mutiny on, the story seems a little rushed, which may have something to do with the fact that the film was originally meant to be divided into two parts. Indeed, one would have liked to see more of the live of the mutineers on Pitcairn and the end suggests a happy-end that was not to be. Personally I found the soundtrack a bit unfitting. Generally I like the Vangelis-sound (he did an outstanding job on Blade Runner and 1492 &#x96; Conquest of Paradise), but the sugary-sweet, dreamy melodies would have been more fitting in a Werner Herzog film. But these flaws are minor and The Bounty is highly recommendable to everybody who is interested in the story of the Bounty-mutiny. An exceptional movie, that would have deserved more attention than it did at the box-office (no doubt most potential viewers likewise expected just another remake).A final theory some claim that Bligh forced the sailors to eat breadfruit on the return-voyage (in which case I myself would call the mutiny justified).8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 December 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The 1984 version of the Mutiny of the Bounty has been sitting on my shelf for quiet a while before I came around to watching it.

The shortest may have been I'm nobody, I'm drunk and depressed; I'm famous, I'm drunk and depressed. I'm fat, I'm drunk and depressed and I'm famous and dead (presumably no longer drunk and depressed). Others have criticized that Val Kilmer looks nothing like the real Lizard King, or that the story adds little new to story of both band and singer. That may to an extent be all true that The Doors is an excellent film.At the same time I have to warn that is by no means an objective opinion. See, I come from a generation where the music of Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, The Who and The Doors was an integral part of growing-up. It didn't even matter that Jim Morrison had already been dead for more than 20 years. See, it was a divided time, where honest music had become scare and channels like MTV had just begun their barrage of intolerable, artificially-hyped fluff (little did we know of the horrors to still come). So there was the alternative between this Pop, some contemporary honest Rock- and Metal-acts like Guns N'Roses or Nirvana, and of course the Golden Oldies from father's tape- and record-collection. This was all zealously played on the weekends and when Oliver Stones The Doors finally arrived on videotape, this too was zealously watched before, during and often after various parties. As said Good times that stand between an objective review.How true to the fact Stones film is, let historians and people from the era decide that. Fact is, that the film captured the essence of the time, the 1960's and 70's, at least to the point where we viewers, who weren't around then, would like to envision it. We cared little about the social-upheaval of the time, the Flower-Power-movement or Vietnam; we cared about honest Rock-music, epic performances and one of the most charismatic band-leaders of the time. All this we got in both the music and the film itself. Again, it is true that Val Kilmer optically didn't look much like Morrison but the performance went far beyond anything that has since (and after) been given by many look-alike characters. Kilmer even did the unthinkable singing most of the material himself and emulating the Lizard King to a tit. Yes, after a few moments Kilmer has convinced us that he IS Morrison, by virtues of acting, not make-up or special-effects. Indeed, a performance that would have deserved more praise and awards than it got.If there's any criticism from my side, it may be that the film is too short. Not just from a fans perspective, who would have spent some more time with Jim, Ray and the other boys (all superbly acted by all involved, included extras and cameos), but because we would have wished to learn a little more about the enigma that was Jim Morrison. Like Oliver Stone once said himself (paraphrasing here) A movie is two hours and you cannot condense a persons full life to two hours. Sure, there must have been more to Morrison than the fast-living hellraiser and drunken hoodlum-poet in the movie, but more often it's what left out from a persons life rather than what's been meticulously shown that turns a life into a legend. That's a balance that Oliver Stone got just right and hence the film gets a very subjective 8\/10 from me.

So, he discovers about Christmas and decides to try it out. Jack gets the people of Halloween Town to make Christmas, and does for what he has to do on his own.

The songs and music by Danny Elfman are really far beyond from being good; they are so memorable like This is Halloween; Making Christmas; What's this?; etc. Many of you would like to know if this movie is either a Halloween movie or a Christmas movie; it just depends on what you make of. To me, personally, I think its both and I always get in the mood when it comes to both Halloween and Christmas at the same time. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out! The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the greatest stop-motion animated movies ever made, and it is one of Burton's greatest achievements! I give it a perfect 10 out of 10.

Sure, you get your money's worth, but don't expect anything more or something like a free autograph or a hi, how are u doing from the last remaining original members without taking out your wallet first. That seems particularly true these days, where the band still produces tours and albums on the sole premise that most fans are completists, who cannot suffer holes in their collections. So, Detroit Rock City was one of the last few cases where the fan had the feeling that this was produced by band & fans for fans and not only for cash.Sure, I had rooted for this film when it came out and sure, as a kid I had my room plastered with KISS-posters, wore KISS-Make-Up during Halloween and religiously bought most things that bore the distinct logo (despite the design being altered in Germany, because it resembled the SS-Runes a little too close, suggesting that Mr. Chaim Wietz and Mr. Stanley Eisen were Nazis). Got my dad to smuggle me into Runaway, despite being a few years short of admission (and I didn't want to go see this film because I'm fond of Tom Selleck). Thinking of it, my parents probably bought Gene Simmons a new Cadillac, despite nowadays I'd hope that this money went into the pockets of either Ace Frehley or Peter Criss.By the time Detroit Rock City hit the cinema, it had pretty much been clear to even the hardened fan, that 90 percent apart from the music was hype and that the two founding members had begun to view their band more of a cash-milking-cow rather than a vehicle to transport good music. But why drop a lifelong habit? Like Richard Linklaters Dazed and Confused, Adam Rifkin was able to capture the feel and air of the time When KISS ruled the world, which is only one aspect that makes the film work. Though by the time I was old enough to get into the concerts KISS had already taken off their iconic make-up, one could really get a feel of what the great KISSteria must have been like. Then there is the humour I'm not easily moved to laugh tears at slapstick, but I have to admit that a heartily laughed more than once. The priest and the mushroom-pizza, the clash between KISS-Fans and Disco-Guidos or the Hawk stripping for cash, it all made me crack up. As a bonus, there are plenty of KISS Insider-jokes, from the names of the protagonists to the dialogue; it should be abundantly clear Adam Rifkin knows his KISS.When talking to the fans, the issue of a sequel would invariably come up.

But what you won't find is this seemingly post-apocalyptic scenario that Christiane F has painted, simply because it never existed other than in the media and the minds of the people.One must give kudos to the film and the director It shows the effect of heavy drug-addiction as realistic and relentless as Leaving Las Vegas shows the effect of alcohol-abuse. The horrors of being a junkie, drifting ever further the social-ladder and the descent into addiction, prostitution and eventually death are indeed harrowing. However, when it comes to the subject of the protagonist and the severity of the general problems, more than just some artistic-liberties have been taken.Unlike the novel and the interviews with (the real) Christiane F, the film neglects to tell us, that Christiane and her friends already come from a severely disturbed, low-class background. Germanys social-system (or if you want, caste-system) is very rigid, similar to that in the US. Can't deny your roots and if you happen to come from a redneck or white trash background, it is very unlikely that all the money in the world will be able to wash that background off.The movie would like to make us believe that any 'nice girl from next door' can slide down into the living hell of the junkie-world, but that is only half true.

However, I have a different, idiosyncratic point-of-view. I think that the girls committed suicide because they lived in what they perceived as a man's world. There is evidence to back up my opinion. The first girl committed suicide during a party intended to keep the girls social; she probably noticed that the boys invited to the house were jerks, especially after noticing how they mistreated the kid who was mentally handicapped. During the same party, a teenager shot a dirty, sensual look at the mother (Kathleen Turner) of the five girls. The fact that she was not surprised by this behavior testifies to the mother's awareness that boys and men had been motivated by lust. The film was narrated by the teenage boys, and they even went out of their way to read the diary of the first girl. Throughout the movie, they only showcased their interpretation of why the daughters of Kathleen Turner's character killed themselves. One kid, for instance, even knew the sewer system as a way of getting into girls' houses; on a similar note, the boys collectively used a telescope to peep into the house of Kathleen Turner's family and often caught Kirsten Dunst engaging in sensual\/sexual activity with a said, particular boy. Josh Hartnett's character also slept with a teacher's wife and eventually became a mental fixation of Kirsten Dunst's character. The film also displays camaraderie between Josh Hartnett and the girls' father who happened to be a teacher at the school the girls attended; such an encounter was symbolic of the cooperation which existed between men in controlling women.

Based on real life.Bonnie and Clyde is a violent film, although by today's standards it may seem fairly tame. The film is quite realistic, although viewers steeped in modern (and generally completely unrealistic) CGI may think quite the opposite. Ask your local trauma surgeon for her opinion. The film presents us with a sexually dysfunctional antihero, a topic only to be found in Indie films these days.B&C belongs to a series of movies that continued with Clockwork Orange and more recently Natural Born Killers. Movies that almost (or perhaps fully?) make us root for violent criminals, exposing how thin the veneer of civil life really is. As one might expect, anything that NBK does is done in more subtle ways in B&C, although it may not have seemed so to moviegoers of the mid-sixties. Where Bonnie gets a dainty little poem about her life of crime published in the newspapers, Mickey of NBK gets his own media crew worshiping him. Where Clyde kills by accident at first, Mickey mass-murders. The twist of irony is deeper in B&C though Clyde can fire off a gun, but he can't fire from the hip, and when he finally does, the guns quickly turn on him. All the characters talk explicitly about how they are good Christians, but unbridled passion will not go unpunished. And Bonnie's poem is as real as the real Bonnie and Clyde, although 100s of years from now their existence will undoubtedly be doubted, as is now the existence of Shakespeare in some quarters.Enough comparison, though. Bonnie and Clyde is the granddaddy of hyperviolent movies, and like all granddaddies must be given credit, even if the envelope was pushed more later on. It's also quite humorous, and it pays to follow the faces of different individual characters in crowded scenes when seeing it again. The southern accents are priceless. The acting is stellar, from an innocent Beatty to a jolly Hackman, a sultry Dunaway to an awe-struck Pollard. Gene Wilder has a cameo, before he became famous in The Producers and all those Mel Brooks films. Director Arthur Penn had a brilliant eye for humor.

I'd liken it to a drug experience if only I'd ever taken drugs before, but the degree to which watching this film simulates what its characters go through is astounding. The story is rather simple a scientist, Eddie Jessup (William Hurt, in his feature film debut) has been doing sensory deprivation experiments, but after a trip to Mexico, he starts doing those experiments under the influence of a powerful psychedelic drug which might possibly be affecting his genetic makeup. Plot-wise, it's not too complicated as it just follows Eddie's personal journey and evolution over the course of these life-altering experiments. Every actor was very capable and William Hurt was especially good considering this was his first role. However, the real magic of the film is in its many hallucinatory images which range from the sacrilegious to the primal. Even if you haven't seen the film, you might already be familiar with the image of a six-eyed, goat-headed man on a cross. Early on, Eddie mentions that he had visions as a young man that were out of Revelation and this imagery is kind of a perversion of that. However, the imagery that occurs later on in the film is extremely hard to describe and honestly it's best if you just see it for yourself. There are some interesting observations\/connections made between religious and psychedelic experiences, and also mental disorders, however the true power of this film is in its images, which were realized with some incredible visual effects. I don't think this film will be to everyone's taste, certainly not those who are religious and might be offended by some of the imagery, but for those brave enough to give it a try it's an experience you won't soon forget.

He wishes for some of the obvious things - wealth, prosperity, knowledge, physical prowess - but she's sneaky enough to give all of the various scenarios an unfortunate catch.As co-written and directed by the late Harold Ramis, this 21st century update of the fondly remembered Dudley Moore \/ Peter Cook comedy never generates any great comedy fireworks. At its best, it's just sort of mildly amusing. It can't really sustain itself for a full hour and 33 minutes, with the more entertaining gags weighted near the beginning. At least it espouses some reasonable themes about selflessness and the idea that life is what we make it.What really drives the 2000 version of Bedazzled is an engaging star duo. Fraser, who'd proved his comedic chops in the past, does his able best to sell the material from sequence to sequence. You could say that he gives 110%. Hurley is extremely enticing, especially with the constant costume changes. She looks especially fetching in the cheerleader and cop outfits. O'Connor is perfect as the object of Frasers' desires, while the supporting cast - Miriam Shor, Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein, Toby Huss - gets to strut their stuff in multiple roles. Ramis casts his repertory player Brian Doyle-Murray as a priest.Overall, this is likable but never really inspired.Six out of 10.
