It's good to know that Hollywood still can produce awesome movie with no sex and violence. This gave me an idea about how to get closed to patients instead of diseases. Patch's way of getting closed to patients is just genius.

As soon as I graduated from elementary school and started on my way to high school, I had people constantly telling to watch The Breakfast Club because it's amazing. They would then tell me they love the movie and I could never seem to get a word out of them past that. No one would tell me what the plot was or why it was so amazing, until one day I straight up asked my mom what this amazing movie is about. She replied with, It's about a bunch of teenagers. I wasn't sure what to do with all of this new information, so I finally sat myself down and watched it. I have to say, I can certainly see why everyone recommended this movie for my then excited soon-to-be eighth grade self. Despite the fact that this movie is set around 30 years ago, the ideas and issues they cover in this movie are timeless. While the focus is teens' issues, they also give us a glimpse into the world of those who are growing older. They show us how alarming it can be to watch as the younger generations stumble in, seemingly destroying everything they can, while the adults change unknowingly into the people they'd hoped they'd never be. There isn't anything I really dislike about this movie. Normally, I would have a whole list of things that I think could be tweaked in a movie. There's something about this movie that feels different. Every time I find something that could be considered a flaw, I consider the context and I realize that it is not in fact a flaw, it is simply something that adds to the story and tone of the film. This film almost feels untouchable; it is still so famous and well-loved so many years later. Despite the fact that it's set in a sketchy, nearly unoccupied high school, this movie somehow contributes to the romanticized fantasy all eighth graders have about high school. High school is a place for the big kids it's where you find your clique and look cool. No matter what is happening in your life, there's always going to be at least one more person who knows what you're going through, which is an idea that is relevant for people of all ages. I really love the fact that John Hughes took characters that you can see in everyday aspects of high school life and broke them down to show that they are multifaceted and more than the image they project. All of the adults in this movie are shown as stubborn, insensitive fools who refuse to bother listening or paying attention to the kids who's live they're messing up. One of the most memorable adults in this film is the looming presence of authority, Principal Vernon. The students seem to view him as a bad guy and I can certainly see why. When I look at him as a character, I see an unhappy, afraid, old man who feels like he's tripping over his feet trying to keep up with the rest of the world. He believes that he is a victim of injustice the kids are just getting brattier and brattier and he's just a guy trying to knock some sense back into them. He receives a strong, cold glass of reality when Carl (the janitor) tells him bluntly and without malice that it's not the kids who are changing, it's him. Yes, I do agree that a lot of young people are brats it's what we do. We're too inexperienced and new to the world to see beyond our problems. What Vernon needs to understand is that he is the one who is changing. Yes, parents can't get away with the same punishment they did a few decades ago and yes, there is a surplus of new technology that is changing the way people experience their lives. But Vernon is changing himself. Nothing seems bright and shiny and new anymore. He's seen every kind of kid you could see, he knows the tricks, and his life has fallen into a sad routine. He expects respect for his experience in the world, while all he does is throw his weight around and pretend that he understands every kid he meets because he's probably met at least three others like them. He can't remember why he chose to do this. He watches bright eyed kids graduate every year to experience new adventures and start their lives. All of these kids are passionate and ready to live and learn new things, but he has no more adventures left.This movie is a cult classic because it has aspects that appeal to both the young and old. Both sides are provided with an insight into the other. We learn about each other's struggles and find that appearances can indeed be misleading. Despite all of the images and airs people may put on, we are all complex humans with valid feelings and thoughts. All we want is to find empathy and belonging. Decades may pass, but we all still have basic, common struggles. I think one of the reasons this movie is so loved is because it's so easy to connect with no matter who you are, if you're a human, you'll probably be able to relate to at least one aspect of this move. This movie helps remind the audience that it's okay if you don't have everything figured out, no matter what age you are. It's hard when you don't know who you are or can't remember.

It is too sprawling and narrative to be the former and too sweeping and Victorian to be the latter. Wikipedia describes it as an epic biographical war film, which I suppose its technically accurate. But it sounds like some description an English teacher would give, one that is not quite appropriate for what is one display here. It is too sweeping, too emotional, too driven, too dedicated to channeling the primal sophistication.From a critical standpoint, perhaps the greatest achievement of the film is how it shows the over-the-top character that is Patton without bias or framing. It shows the man as he was and how he saw the world. The people who like Patton come out of this movie thinking that it wanted them to like him. The people who don't like Patton come out of this movie thinking that it didn't want them to like Patton. Of course, really it is neither. It is somehow faces left and right without stopping staring straight ahead.I would say that Patton is one of those people whose lives just beg to be put on screen. He is basically what you would get if you combined the high points of the arrogant jerk character and the typical protagonist and blew it up tenfold. There are characters in film that are made to be unbelievably over-the-top but they don't come close to Patton. None of this is meant as an insult, by the way; he seems to transcend reality, bringing truth the old axiom, The difference between truth and fiction is that fiction has to make sense. He saw life as his story; yes, kids, if you think the world revolves around you, one day, you might be the greatest general of your time.But seriously, he believed himself to be the reincarnation of every great general in history, including the aforementioned Napoleon and Alexander the Great. He lived for war; it allowed him to rise to what he felt was his destiny. It is poetic that he died not long after the German surrender.What I'm trying to say is that the film reflects the man. This film is not light or fluffy about war or Patton, but it is not a hyper-realistic Saving Private Ryan-type movie either. It is as if Patton is a lead actor on the world's deadliest stage. As it should be.The only times the camera moves off Patton are the battle scenes. And even then, could you really say that they moved off him at all? Patton is battle. If anything, they moved off his outer frame and into his heart. This is the kind of man who would fight forever and never find it boring.I find it interesting that the screenplays for this and Apocalypse Now were both penned by the same man, Francis Ford Coppola. There are many similarities between the films; if you don't think that Colonel Kilgore was channeling at least some of Patton's energy, you did not watch the same movie that I did. Of course, Patton is a more complex character\/person, but I can certainly imagine him saying something along the lines of, I love the smell of napalm in the morning. Both films also dive into the heart of war in a way that few others do. It is not portrayed in exactly the same way in both, but some of the basic elements are the same. Think about it. Take a normal war movie. Likely as not, the environment is portrayed like a deadly lion stalking its prey. There is nothing wrong with this in fact, one of my all-time favorite films, Saving Private Ryan, goes this route. But those sorts of films have been done a million times and you need to be outstanding to not be a blip. Coppola's vision, on the other hand, is unique.The lion does not chase its prey. It charges towards it with eyes of insanity. Most war films have a deathly feel. Coppola's give off the impression that they are revoltingly, horrifyingly alive. He focuses more on the insanity so present in war than its morbidness. As a result, his films feel more interesting, and in a perverted way, more realistic. There are very few directors who could pull that off. He is one of them.For that matter, there are very few people who could convincingly play George S. Patton. George C. Scott is one of them, and not just because his name kind of looks like Patton's. He was the sort of rebel that really doesn't exist anymore, couldn't exist anymore- just like Patton. He also produced the sorts of results that are nigh-impossible to replicate- just like Patton. The casting is topped only by the execution. I do not just believe his performance whenever I watch it; I give up to it. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for this role; though, in true rebel fashion, he turned it down.This movie took home a whole slew of Academy Awards, and rightfully so; I would have been angered if it didn't, and not just because it's a good movie. 1970 was a terrible year for film; the second best movie released that year was likely either Love Story or Airport, two movies that I like well enough but are not all-time great movies in the least. Keep that in mind every time someone says how terrible movies are nowadays. This film towered over the cinematic year like Patton himself towered over any war theatre he took to.Goodnight.

He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for this role; though, in true rebel fashion, he turned it down.This movie took home a whole slew of Academy Awards, and rightfully so; I would have been angered if it didn't, and not just because it's a good movie. 1970 was a terrible year for film; the second best movie released that year was likely either Love Story or Airport, two movies that I like well enough but are not all-time great movies in the least. Keep that in mind every time someone says how terrible movies are nowadays. This film towered over the cinematic year like Patton himself towered over any war theatre he took to.Goodnight.

My opinion. No. Because it was his quality of family life, and normal life that suffered. I had heard the real Joe Pistone, tell quite a terrifying tale, which had him in another room, where two mafia guys were fifty fifty about him, and were having a discussion on whether to whack him, where Joe heard the whole tale. Now, put yourself in this situation, you can imagine. Depp, plays the real life Pistone, again to polished perfection, who went undercover as Don the jeweler, and was taken in by Lefty, (a feared mafia man, who becomes a pathetic pussy later on, as his status deteriorates, where Sonny (Michael Madsen, doing what he does best, smiling and looking intimidating with those mannerisms, we love) one of Lefty's gang, replaced him. It's really hard to rate Madsen's performance in this. The other two of Lefty's mob are played by Bruno Kirby and James Russo. Russo really surprised me actually. He's hasn't done work this good for a long time. Pacino as Lefty is just another masterpiece of a performance. I mean, what else can I say? He really carved out this real life character so deep, especially playing the pitiable part well, where Donnie seems to be his real only friend. Anne Heche is great as Depp's suffering wife, and is sexy too, as well as being a great actress. Violence wise, it's only violent when it needs to be, but when it happens, when the blood sprays, it's strong. In particular I'm taking about one scene, before human dismemberment, takes place. This is very smartly modified, as the visuals could of been much worse. Here's just another well told mafia tale, with great acting and writing. In contrast, bits of this one I familiarize with the current Black Mass, with Depp on the other end of the law. But what you really get out of this film, is how scary going over cover is, and Lefty's mob aren't idiots.

The film promises excitement and entertainment and it delivers on its promise. It even gives you two Zorros for the price of one. Anthony Hopkins plays Don Diego de la Vega, Zorro number one. Unfortunately for de la Vega when we meet him his time as a swashbuckling hero is about to be cut short in rather tragic fashion. He loses everything that is dear to him and is tossed into a dungeon. Twenty years later he escapes and plots his revenge. Only by this point he's a little too old for the Zorro stuff. He needs a protégé. Enter Alejandro Murrieta, played by Antonio Banderas. Alejandro, seeking revenge of his own, is raw and uncultured, nowhere near as suave as the original Zorro. And being suave is part of what makes Zorro Zorro. de la Vega will have to teach the new Zorro so much more than how to use a sword.Conveniently the man who wronged Alejandro, Captain Love, is now the right-hand man of Don Montero, the man who wronged de la Vega. They will take their vengeance together. Of course it's not quite that simple, there are complications. As you would expect in a movie of this sort one of those complications is a stunningly beautiful woman. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Elena, the daughter Montero stole from de la Vega when she was an infant all those years ago. Elena and Alejandro fall for each other because of course they do. Meanwhile there are still those bad guys who need to be dispatched and a plot to steal California which needs to be foiled. This of course will involve sword fights. Many, many sword fights. Hey, it's a Zorro movie, what were you expecting? The movie greatly benefits from the performances of its three leads. Hopkins is reliably brilliant and clearly enjoying himself in a role which allows him to have some real fun for once. Banderas really grows into the role of Zorro as the movie progresses. He may not be very suave in the beginning but by the end he's quite the charmer. And Zeta-Jones brings a great spark to the proceedings. Elena's not your stereotypical damsel in distress, she gives as good as she gets. Zeta-Jones fits the role perfectly, full of confidence and charisma. Being drop-dead gorgeous doesn't hurt either. Banderas and Zeta-Jones have great chemistry but so too, in a very different way, do Banderas and Hopkins. Everyone plays off one another ever so well. While certainly not as memorable as the three stars the villains play their parts well too. A movie like this needs strong antagonists and here we are not disappointed, these are some truly hissable villains. Captain Love is so over-the-top in his evilness it's a little hard to believe. But the character is based on a real-life figure so give the movie the benefit of the doubt I suppose. Anyhow if you hate the bad guys, and you will, that can only help the movie in the end as you become more emotionally invested. This movie has a lot going for it. Action, drama, romance. A great story, great actors, great visuals, great music. Heroes to cheer, villains to despise. It's certainly not the most serious-minded of films but it's serious enough when it needs to be.

The movie's core is the dynamic between Arthur and Hobson, how the latter gently, but firmly, guides and protects him. He conceals his imminent death from Arthur until the very end, preparing Linda, quite sternly, for the heavy lifting of loving Arthur ahead for her.This is my favorite comedy for many reasons 1.

Yes, my header is spoken by Burt Johnson, Arthur's future father in law who does not have Hobson's patience for Arthur's flippancy and mockery in the funniest scene in the movie.

Arthur's progression to manhood, when he finds the love he has been searching for he throws off his liquid crutch that deadened the pain of abandonment. Hobson discovers this love when he mocks Linda and Arthur yells at him. Hobson's death is done so well and understated. My favorite scene is where Hobson looks away from Arthur and mumbles,Arthur, you're a good son. They both are so embarrassed by their love for each other.

Gielgud never gave a better performance; the dyad between Moore and Gielgud, the understated deep love will endear this classic to you. The writing is on a level you will never see again in your lifetime. There are quotable one-liners that would be the highlight of other entire movies; this movie has hundreds of them.

It tries to be really cool, but it can't deliver at all.The director seemingly knew nothing about composition. The revealing shots and cuts are ridiculous to watch. There is also no character ark. The guy starts out as the Exterminator right away. All it takes is his friend getting attacked and he's like Yep, this city just turned into Vietnam. Prepare yourselves, bitches.

Heavily inspired by the Dark Horse comic that featured Dutch's brother as an LA gang cop, the lack of Arnie, who's wage demands were knocked back by the studio, clearly went against the movie from the start.In retrospect, Danny Glover's resourceful, seasoned LA gang cop is sound replacement and delivers in what is possibly his best action role. Compared to Murtagh in Lethal Weapon half a decade earlier, he looks a lot younger, fitter and buff enough as a believable opponent for the Predator.The supporting characters are total comic-book and right on the money.These larger than life, stereotypes fit beautifully into this world and there are so many of them, Colombians, Jamaicans, Bill Paxtons, that you don't have time to stop and think about their lack of dimension. They're bubble gum, and fun. A real treat for me watching 25 years on is the atmosphere and feel of the classic 80's sci-fi movies still celebrated today. Predator 2 almost seems to exist in the same universe as RoboCop, borrowing heavily from the aesthetic and attitude of the media, the overcrowded police station and Lewis in Maria Conchita Alonso, which is something that may have seemed derivative at the time but in retrospect, would not seem out of place now with the MCU. Drawing on many influences of the time, throwing them in a pot and seeing what comes out the other end is part of Predator 2's charm but also part of the problem, especially as it veers a little too close into ALIENS territory later in the film, however I can live with that and looking back makes me nostalgic for a great era of sci-fi. But it's not without flaws and there are a couple of problems I had at the time that are amplified now. On release, I felt the film was toned down, not as violent as the first and that it had possibly been edited for a lower rating. In retrospect, it's actually a far more violent film than the original, there's blood and bullets everywhere, but what I was picking up on and what I see clearly now, is more to do with the way Predator 2 is lit and shot. Stephen Hopkins was hired to direct only his 3rd film coming straight off the back of Nightmare On Elm St 5, a film that is widely regarded as the weakest of that franchise and aside from Lost In Space has mostly directed TV since.So it's no surprise that a lot of the scenes in Predator 2 look far less cinematic that they should and instead have more of an X-Files vibe. The lighting is too bright and colourful, whilst watching, you can't shake the fact that this is staged and shot on a set. In my view, it suffers the same problem as RoboCop 2 whereby the lower budget of the preceding film gave the original a rough and ready look, where the sequels ramp up the production values to the point where everything looks far too polished and fake. But crucially, the make up and blood looks almost clean enough to eat and the death scenes are just underwhelming.Exploding heads and chests are replaced with sparklers and cut away shots, which work well in the right context, the Reservoir Dogs torture is a great example of getting it right, but here the camera avoids everything so there's no pay off. You just get fragments and sweeps which are very effective in terms of replicating comic book panels but after the imaginative bloodbath of the first movie, you're left feeling short changed.During the opening sequence there are some brilliant cuts shot between VHS camera's, grainy, hand-held, shaky that represent the view of the media. They look far more realistic for my money and that's how I would have liked to have seen this picture shot.Overall, Predator 2 is a bold and innovative precursor to the MCU.It's a movie that appears to have been designed by a studio with bold plans for a bigger universe, heavily hinting at crossover potential and I would have loved to have seen this era of Fox expand into the Alien Vs Predator territory it hinted at, rather than the damp squibs that came a decade later. Ultimately, Fox picked an inexperienced director who didn't have the resume of a John McTiernan or James Cameron, presumably so that they had more control but in doing so, paid the price with a sequel that almost kills but lacks the genuine wonder and sincerity in its execution, that made the first movie so compelling.

In my view, it suffers the same problem as RoboCop 2 whereby the lower budget of the preceding film gave the original a rough and ready look, where the sequels ramp up the production values to the point where everything looks far too polished and fake. But crucially, the make up and blood looks almost clean enough to eat and the death scenes are just underwhelming.Exploding heads and chests are replaced with sparklers and cut away shots, which work well in the right context, the Reservoir Dogs torture is a great example of getting it right, but here the camera avoids everything so there's no pay off. You just get fragments and sweeps which are very effective in terms of replicating comic book panels but after the imaginative bloodbath of the first movie, you're left feeling short changed.During the opening sequence there are some brilliant cuts shot between VHS camera's, grainy, hand-held, shaky that represent the view of the media. They look far more realistic for my money and that's how I would have liked to have seen this picture shot.Overall, Predator 2 is a bold and innovative precursor to the MCU.It's a movie that appears to have been designed by a studio with bold plans for a bigger universe, heavily hinting at crossover potential and I would have loved to have seen this era of Fox expand into the Alien Vs Predator territory it hinted at, rather than the damp squibs that came a decade later. Ultimately, Fox picked an inexperienced director who didn't have the resume of a John McTiernan or James Cameron, presumably so that they had more control but in doing so, paid the price with a sequel that almost kills but lacks the genuine wonder and sincerity in its execution, that made the first movie so compelling.

She'd dreamt that she was being chased through a dark boiler room by a horribly burnt man named Freddy, who was trying to kill her with a bladed glove. A typical nightmare, except that Nancy had the exact same dream.After Rod confesses to Nancy that he, too, dreamt of Freddy and is found hanged after Nancy dreams that Freddy visited him in jail, it confirms her suspicions that he is not the real killer and that something much more sinister is going on.The nightmares start escalating and she begins to wake up with real injuries on her body after having them inflicted upon her during her dreams, until she is literally forced to stay awake in order to stay alive.Nancy starts to believe that she is going crazy until her alcoholic mother confesses that Freddy was once a real person; a serial child killer who was burned to death by outraged vigilante parents when Freddy evaded jail due to a technicality.After she discovers that she is able to pull objects from her dreams into the real world, Nancy sees this as an opportunity to defeat Freddy and take back control of her dreams and her life.A Nightmare on Elm Street came out at a time when the slasher genre was getting very stale but writer and director Wes Craven managed to put a unique and refreshing spin on it.In contrast to the fictional movie serial killers that came before him (Leatherface, Michael Myers, Jason) Freddy is neither mute nor robotic. Instead, he is very animated and relishes in verbally taunting his victims before he kills them. Robert Englund was clearly having the time of his life playing Freddy; so much so that it has become synonymous with him as an actor and it's hard to picture anyone else in the role (sorry Jackie Earl Haley) and he even went on to star in all seven sequels (eight, including Freddy vs. Jason) plus the short lived TV series 'Freddy's Nightmares.'Heather Langenkamp does a decent job as Nancy, and is everything a horror movie heroine should be; vulnerable but strong.Johnny Depp provides some delectable eye candy as Nancy's boyfriend in his first movie role. I have personally never seen Ronee Blakley act in anything else (supposedly she is a credible actress), but I have a hard time deciding if she is just bad in the role of Nancy's mother, or whether it was a conscious acting choice to play her as over dramatic and over the top to make her seem more detached and in denial of the situation.
