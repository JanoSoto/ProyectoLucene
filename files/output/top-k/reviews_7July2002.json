Bad press and word of mouth followed this movie around like the plague upon its release at Thanksgiving, 2000. On one level, of course, I can understand it; Grinch certainly didn't need the big-screen, live action treatment - the simple half-hour cartoon is, and always will be, a classic unto itself. But exactly because that version is in no danger of going away or being forgotten (or - perish the thought! - replaced), I for one was able to be more generous and forgiving when watching this movie. Oh hell, I might as well admit it - I watched it at all pretty much explicitly to see what Jim Carrey was going to do with the lead role. On that score, I was not disappointed; he took the basic character sketch that is the Grinch and embroidered it with all manner of tics, impersonations, and over-the-top shenanigans. As usual, if you're no fan of Carrey - and broad humor in general - there's nothing here that will convert you. Me, I'm constantly astonished by his resourcefulness and creativity, as well as the almost superhuman energy he brings to every role. Here it's especially impressive, as he coaxes a pulsing life force to come through layers and layers of prosthetics. In fact, it occurred to me, watching the film, that if anyone could be a modern day Lon Chaney, it would be Jim Carrey - I could see him making a good career out of bringing life to a rogues' gallery of monsters, grotesques, and other costumed or heavily made-up characters. It would in fact seem the natural extension of his talents and inclination; if there's ever been anyone constrained by the notion of being a normal person, it's Jim Carrey. But by the same token, no one - not Jack Nicholson in Batman, not Christopher Lloyd in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, not even Paul Reubens as Pee Wee Herman - has seemed so at home projecting the weightlessness and exaggeration of a cartoon existence more fully than Jim Carrey. This is no easy trick by any stretch of the imagination, and I hope for all our sakes that he'll always at least keep his hand in this style of performing; there's many who can do realistic acting (in varying degrees of quality, of course) - there's precious few, maybe no one else currently alive, who can do what Carrey does.As to the movie itself is there anything here beyond Carrey's performance that makes it worth seeing? Not really. But then again there's nothing that really gets in the way, either. The sets and the basic look of the movie are reasonably well done nothing overtly memorable, but not the ugly and barren wasteland many reviewers have suggested. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou-Hoo is suitably cute in her part without being insufferable (and on that score let's not forget that even Dr. Seuss's Cindy Lou was impossibly precious and saccharine in the first place) and she develops a nice rapport with Carrey that helps anchor the film. The backstory which explains the Grinch and how he became that way . . . well, yeah, it's stupid, but it also doesn't take up much time, so if you just twiddle your thumbs for a few minutes you can get through it without too much pain or discomfort. But many objected to the film on the basic grounds that its portrayal of the Hoos was an abomination; that it took the simple, good-hearted creatures of the Dr. Seuss original and turned them into lunk-headed and materialistic busybodies - in essence, caricatures of Yuletide soul-lessness and consumerism. Personally, I think it's an interesting change. Seuss's heart was always more with Grinch's cynicism and disgruntlement anyway, so it makes sense to pile on those qualities in an extended treatment of the story. Furthermore, while the Hoos as paragons of perfect virtue and simplicity works OK in a 22-minute treatment (especially one where we don't see much of them), there's something fundamentally false and unsatisfying about it. After all, even in the original tale, these people *are* pretty ostentatious and materialistic in their celebration of Christmas. It makes sense to me that they - just as much as the Grinch - would need a reminder in what the true meaning of the holiday season really is before they would lovingly burst into song at the prospect of a Christmas without any presents or decorations. And, of course, this makes them closer in conception to the average American, and thereby more identifiable and accessible (if necessarily less admirable). Especially since, as I've said, this new version doesn't wipe out the old one, I think the change in the Hoos is utterly defensible and adds an interesting wrinkle that the film can truly call its own. So that's the Grinch, circa 2000 - no big whoop, but no big travesty either. And if you like Jim Carrey, another notch on his belt of impressive performances. That's really all you need to know.

After recovering from the shock I recall this is a low budget movie and realize that Hollywood is still stuck in it's conservative mire.Nice simple plot this one. Jessica Stein has gotten nowhere with the men in her life - there's always been some flaw. In a fit of experimentation she answers an end from one Helen, a woman seeking a relationship with a woman. From there we see Jessica awkwardly adjusting to this new life, while overhead looms her brother's wedding and - in her office - her ex-fiancée, who is still in love with her. It's simple enough, but this is a romantic comedy and doesn't really need a twisting narrative.But is it any good? Is it romantic? Yeah, it is. What's refreshing here is the relationship itself. There's no agenda here, nor is the relationship a product of some male fantasy (the script was written by the two female leads). Instead its full of amusing moments, with awkwardness (particularly on Jessica's part) and genuine feeling (as the movie progresses). It's not trying to be an issue movie, although the movie does falter in its stereotypes of other characters (Helen's museum friends, the Jewish mother). Still the characters are all likable and none ever grate on your nerves.Direction is grand. There's a `hand cam' feel approach at times, presumably from both artistic merit and budgetary limitations. It's good enough - the pacing is grand, the movie never really drags and the lead characters share just enough of the spot light so as not to upstage anyone. The performances the actors give are good. They're certainly not excellent but they do get themselves into character and let us suspend our disbelief (which is their job).So in the end this movie is worth seeing. There's not enough meat to fill you up, but the amiable nature of the cast, and script makes it a nice snack.

It is however a necessity to read it, in most cases, to be able to understand the movie and what it attempts to present to the viewer.I admit that I watched the movie before I ever read the book. Since I have read it many times now, my opinion of the movie has not changed as drastically as one might think. Granted, on the whole the movie can not be deemed anything other than disappointing when compared to its origin, but objectively it was somewhat of a success.The book in it's entirety is on the same scale, perhaps, as, for example, The Lord of The Rings when it comes to it's complexity. The corporations, political families and hierarchies, cultural backgrounds, religions and discriminations alone would have made this a difficult production, so it is no surprise that it is barely comparable to the novel. But aside from these things there is the embedded plotline following the young ducal heir, Paul, on his (for want of a better word) adventure, which is often immensely confusing.His destiny is one so profound and if you'd read the novel, you would understand exactly how difficult it would be to convey its complexity and to represent his gifts properly. That is undoubtedly why this element of the story is not explored nearly enough in the movie. The movie concentrates, instead, more on the conflict with the harkonnens, and that is why I believe the ending is not nearly as powerful as it should be. It is not as important to the movie's particular story as it is to the book, and so doesn't fit the way it should.The characters, who I believe were perfectly cast, were the embodiment of professional, great acting. Though in the confines of the script, the characters personalities and relationships were not explored in nearly enough depth when compared to the novel, they were still superb and beautiful and no one else could have portrayed them better, from the sly and repulsive Baron, the devious and playful feyd to the stunning yet guarded jessica and the mysteriously cunning reverend mother.The sets were exquisite, and very close to what would have been expected. While in the tv series the atreides home was impersonal and unlived, in the movie the homes were beautifully ancient and symbolic of both the advanced technologies of the time, and of the old fashioned culture, almost Medieval in some respects.The special effects may have been greatly lacking, but then the movie centred more on the conflict in the story and so placed more importance on the visual effects used.On the whole I enjoy the movie a great deal, it is a great fantasy story and quite intriguing and interesting, truly a cult classic, but if you are looking for a wider story, or just wish to explore the characters or the many parts that were not included in the movie, read the novel, and indeed the others of the series.

Granted, on the whole the movie can not be deemed anything other than disappointing when compared to its origin, but objectively it was somewhat of a success.The book in it's entirety is on the same scale, perhaps, as, for example, The Lord of The Rings when it comes to it's complexity. The corporations, political families and hierarchies, cultural backgrounds, religions and discriminations alone would have made this a difficult production, so it is no surprise that it is barely comparable to the novel. But aside from these things there is the embedded plotline following the young ducal heir, Paul, on his (for want of a better word) adventure, which is often immensely confusing.His destiny is one so profound and if you'd read the novel, you would understand exactly how difficult it would be to convey its complexity and to represent his gifts properly. That is undoubtedly why this element of the story is not explored nearly enough in the movie. The movie concentrates, instead, more on the conflict with the harkonnens, and that is why I believe the ending is not nearly as powerful as it should be. It is not as important to the movie's particular story as it is to the book, and so doesn't fit the way it should.The characters, who I believe were perfectly cast, were the embodiment of professional, great acting. Though in the confines of the script, the characters personalities and relationships were not explored in nearly enough depth when compared to the novel, they were still superb and beautiful and no one else could have portrayed them better, from the sly and repulsive Baron, the devious and playful feyd to the stunning yet guarded jessica and the mysteriously cunning reverend mother.The sets were exquisite, and very close to what would have been expected. While in the tv series the atreides home was impersonal and unlived, in the movie the homes were beautifully ancient and symbolic of both the advanced technologies of the time, and of the old fashioned culture, almost Medieval in some respects.The special effects may have been greatly lacking, but then the movie centred more on the conflict in the story and so placed more importance on the visual effects used.On the whole I enjoy the movie a great deal, it is a great fantasy story and quite intriguing and interesting, truly a cult classic, but if you are looking for a wider story, or just wish to explore the characters or the many parts that were not included in the movie, read the novel, and indeed the others of the series.

Barry is an ambitious young man who is, alas, a slave to his own desires which he cannot always keep under control. Along the way these emotions both assist and threaten his well being in matters of live and love.Ryan O'Neal plays the titular role. As this is a movie spanning many years he plays the character at different ages (and thus, as a young man, doesn't quite look the part). Most of the time he's alright - Redmond Barry is a passionate young man, disciplined only by his driving ambition to be someone important. However I was left somewhat cold by the performance - I never really empathised with him. Partially this is due to Redmond Barry being a very flawed human being, but it also down to O'Neal's somewhat taciturn performance. Other performances are mixed - there's the (overly) cute kid, a `snivelling brat' performance, the hard-nosed mother (a great showing by Marie Kean). The more memorable characters seem to come from the smaller roles, where the actors invest more energy into their pieces.What helps this movie greatly is the talented work of its director - the legendary Stanley Kubrick. The movie looks gorgeous (again). The cinematography is absolutely incredible - scenes (intentionally) look like rendered paintings. The attention to lighting is breath taking - Kubrick took the ambitious move of using natural lighting for night scenes (no stage lights at all), and it pays off giving candle-lit scenes a real glow and authenticity - small wonder it won an Oscar here. In fact the movie is a brilliant example of a periodical drama - costumes, scenery, background detail all allow you to really absorb the feeling of the area. This is due to Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail, which pays off in other areas - the score is similarly wonderful (deserving the Oscar that it won). Other details - such as the background use of birds in the barn scene - are nicely done. The area that Kubrick perhaps slipped up on was the length - the movie does tend to drag in parts. The pacing is generally fine but there's a sense that certain elements could have been removed in the interest of audience attention. Having said that I was never bored by the movie, primarily because Kubrick's talent helped otherwise boring scenes look interesting.`Barry Lyndon' is definitely worth viewing - principally to see a talented director at work in a movie that's - for the most part - fairly decent.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, History"},{"date":"7 July 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  `Barry Lyndon' is about the rise of Redmond Barry, from a reasonably comfortable Irishman to lavish English gentleman, and his subsequent fall. Barry is an ambitious young man who is, alas, a slave to his own desires which he cannot always keep under control. Along the way these emotions both assist and threaten his well being in matters of live and love.Ryan O'Neal plays the titular role. As this is a movie spanning many years he plays the character at different ages (and thus, as a young man, doesn't quite look the part). Most of the time he's alright - Redmond Barry is a passionate young man, disciplined only by his driving ambition to be someone important. However I was left somewhat cold by the performance - I never really empathised with him. Partially this is due to Redmond Barry being a very flawed human being, but it also down to O'Neal's somewhat taciturn performance. Other performances are mixed - there's the (overly) cute kid, a `snivelling brat' performance, the hard-nosed mother (a great showing by Marie Kean). The more memorable characters seem to come from the smaller roles, where the actors invest more energy into their pieces.What helps this movie greatly is the talented work of its director - the legendary Stanley Kubrick. The movie looks gorgeous (again). The cinematography is absolutely incredible - scenes (intentionally) look like rendered paintings. The attention to lighting is breath taking - Kubrick took the ambitious move of using natural lighting for night scenes (no stage lights at all), and it pays off giving candle-lit scenes a real glow and authenticity - small wonder it won an Oscar here. In fact the movie is a brilliant example of a periodical drama - costumes, scenery, background detail all allow you to really absorb the feeling of the area. This is due to Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail, which pays off in other areas - the score is similarly wonderful (deserving the Oscar that it won). Other details - such as the background use of birds in the barn scene - are nicely done. The area that Kubrick perhaps slipped up on was the length - the movie does tend to drag in parts. The pacing is generally fine but there's a sense that certain elements could have been removed in the interest of audience attention. Having said that I was never bored by the movie, primarily because Kubrick's talent helped otherwise boring scenes look interesting.`Barry Lyndon' is definitely worth viewing - principally to see a talented director at work in a movie that's - for the most part - fairly decent.

A View to a Kill is a good Bond film that suffers from one thing, Moore was to old to be playing James Bond by 1985, because Bond has to look like he can handle himself in a fight and perform all manner of stunts plus look like a woman as young as Tanya Roberts would be attracted to him, Moore couldn't pull off either of those things. Everything else he done fine, but the moment 007 has to spring into action its glaringly obvious to everyone its Rogers double doing the athletic bits, why wasn't obvious to the makers and Roger himself?. Octopussy would have been the perfect send off for Moore. Its still sad to see him go though as he was in my opinion a great James Bond with the Spy who Loved Me his best film, 8 years previous to this. This is still a Bond film though and there some great action sequences, especially the chase through Paris. Walken is fine as the villain but I expected more from him. I think Grace Jones was great and Tanya Roberts was gorgeous but wasn't given much to do but scream and yell James every five minutes, another good score from John Barry (please use him again Bond producers) and a cracking theme tune from those Duran Duran lads. Thanks for keeping the James Bond series going Roger, now over to you Timothy.
