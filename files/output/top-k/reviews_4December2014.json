Well, this a review I'm FINALLY gonna be typing out for a film that really deserves it.And I think it deserves a rating HIGHER than 7.9 - like seriously?? I read that earlier it had a 8.1!Now I watched the first Toy Story a ZILLION times before this sequel was released - and rightfully so. I mean I was no more than 5, and the playroom with the television set & VHS player was just my jam! (NOt to mention those fun CD games I used play on Windows computers) But, I'm even quite a big movie buff today; but most of the time, I now usually make YouTube videos discussing the issues of Science, Creation, Evolution, and Dinosaurs.Anyways, this film was the very first movie I saw in the THEATER! I was just 7 years old! And at that point in my life, not only did life feel so innocent & easy, but I liked movies not so much for their story, but more for their visuals - and Toy Story 2 had that in DROGUES! (As well as Phantom Menace, though that's a flick generally everyone almost hates.)Furthermore, most often times, I seem to meet people (especially in Japan here) who either know more about the first Toy Story, or the most recent 3rd one. I feel as if a lot people aren't referencing this movie ENOUGH! And though it is somewhat generally well-known, I still feel as if doesn't get enough attention it deserves! I mean, you've got a much better story (compared to the 1st or 3rd one, IMO), lots of new characters (Zurg being my favorite), an AMAZING intro with Buzz (which quite literally BLEW me away when I was just 7 years old in that theater), there being comic references to Japan (the country where I was born & now live in - which kinda asks the question, why isn't this film more famous here if Japan got referenced a lot, like in Cars 2?), amazing plot twists, a climax that takes place in an airport (Oh, and I just *love* airports & airplanes - they're my favorite form of travel, though I haven't used them very often), jokes that work with both children and adults, great pop-cultural references (like Star Wars - Empire Strikes Back colorful characters, stunning animation, great character study, pretty memorable songs, soundtrack, scenes, and quotes, HILARIOUS blooper end credits that just keep making me laugh over & over etc.And a good thing the movie was nominated for an Oscar (AT ALL!) for the song When Somebody Loved Me - and rightfully so. That's a song that my sisters kept singing out of the blew almost every year I was growing up - just to mention for laughs.But I believe it's THIS movie that should've won PIXAR an Oscar for Best Animated Film much earlier - not Toy Story 3, really; I think that's one that should've gone to How To Train Your Dragon. I'm serious. And I almost felt something was LACKING from the 3rd Toy Story; I don't know if it was the look of the animation, or whether the traveling feel was absent, or if the jokes were too lame, or that I didn't cry at the end, or if the possible fact the movie seemed purely fueled by nostalgia purposes - I'm just still confused as to why it's made it on the Top 250 on IMDb. Shouldn't it be THIS movie instead!? Or who knows! Maybe the 3rd one DOES deserve to be up there, and I just don't know something that others do.And it's definitely one of the movies that Tom Hanks should be known for on his IMDb profile, rather instead of say The DaVinci Code or The Green Mile (those are just two films I can't stand, 'cause I either find them too overrated, too controversial, or just too weird) - Hanks' voice is just so well-acted in this movie (or fair enough, in the other two Toy Story's), I just imagine all the gestures & hand motions he must've done behind that microphone. lol Hey, he's an actor - he be as colorful, or over-the-top as he wants.Toy Story 2... It's just too good! In my opinion, it's WAY better than either 1 or 3. Not only do I think this is this one of the greatest sequels ever, it's also my favorite PIXAR movie, one of my favorite Disney movies, definitely one my favorite movies ever, and surely one of greatest movies of all time!!(FUNNY TRIVIA It was this movie from where I learned the basic directions of LEFT & RIGHT - and my memory keeps coming back to it! hahaha)Someone PLEASE get this back onto the Top 250 on IMDb! I BEG you!10\/10PS But now, I wonder what they're gonna do with Toy Story 4??

As can be expected, combining the two creates cinematic gold. This adaptation of King Lear relocates the play to Japan a few centuries later than the play is set. A powerful war lord abdicates to his 3 sons and 2 of them turn against him and betray him. Shakespeare films rarely capture his genius, but this one does and then some. It adds depth and complexity to an already fine play, and makes the central character arguably even more compelling than he was in Shakespeare's version. It makes some changes here and there, but it doesn't feel overly different from its source material. This isn't just an adaptation of the play; it's using the play to create a sobering, fantastically powerful and completely mesmerising meditation of loyalty, chaos and war. This is absolutely incredible cinema which shows why it is one of the most successful art forms in the world. This dazzling, earth shaking masterpiece outshines not only every single other Shakespeare adaptation but all the paintings in the Lourve combined.Akira Kurosawa's direction is near perfect The film looks unbelievable and the battle sequences are absolutely tremendous. Every single shot looks amazing and it's definitely his most beautiful film. The acting is absolutely astonishing, and there are some particularly frightening characters in this one. It also has an incredible script; it's incredibly deep, hauntingly powerful and none of the dialogue feels forced or awkward. It's a fairly slow movie, but you don't even notice it. The final shot of the movie is utterly haunting. Ran is a very powerful and thrilling movie with amazing action scenes, mind blowing acting and a brilliant story. It's so ridiculously captivating and well made 2 and a half hours disappear like nothing. Definitely one of the best foreign language movies ever and even better than the film which put Kurosawa on the map, Rashomon. Films like Romeo + Juliet and O are good, but they can't possibly hope to match this, which is actually just as good as King Lear itself. At least they actually say what happened to the fool this time.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 December 2014","score":"","review":" Akira Kurosawa is one of my favourite directors and William Shakespeare is my favourite writer of all time.

Now, watching it again I have trouble to understand what made me love that movie. It just seems meh, now. Looking at the positive reviews to find the answer I just see a bunch of people gloating over having a sense of humor and not being easily offended. So well, that must be it. When I was young this movie just seemed outrageous and I loved it because I thought it was daring. Now, I am just too used to dark movies and this one doesn't seem to be too outstanding so the weak parts of the movie are not as easy to overlook.My main issue is that, it just isn't funny. At the same time it is not a marketing mistake that I often see when a movie is presented as comedy while it is a 100% drama. I can see that they were really going for a dark comedy, but the comedy part is pretty much non-existent. There are a few moments that make one smirk, but other than that I am not sure where is comedy.The movie is still above the average. Mainly thanks to the great cast with brilliant acting skills. Christian Slater should have gotten an Oscar for this. Was surprised to find out that John Favreau was in it. The guy has changed so much, it is only his voice and way of talking that made me recognize him. Watching them all acting it out was a pleasure. Also, it had many pretty original moments.

I am not a big horror fan, but this is one of the best horror films I have ever seen. It is rare that a horror movie is legitimately good or scary. This is not legitimately good, but it does a good job in putting scares into half of the people that watch it. The other half will think of it as a so bad, it's good movie. It is really cheesy with over-the-top gore and death scenes and over-acting. Luckily, it does not cross the line between fun and stupidity. Some of the monsters and special effects are funny. After a while of letting them soak in, you start to take them more seriously. The story of a magic box that unleashes demons sent to torture people is a good concept, as people believe real ouija boards really do unleash evil spirits. A playboy manages to escape the clutches after blood from his lover's husband drops on his remains, letting him slowly come back to life. The whole concept is very interesting, but as an 80s horror movie, you can't expect greatness. Like Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, the main killer kicks ass. Pinhead (played by Doug Bradley) does not make any kills (he lets his goons and death instruments do the work), but he is as scary as Jason and Freddy. Also like the two other movies mentioned, the style is 100% 80s. All that was missing was headbands, Michael Jackson, and Miami Vice. Other than that, you get the feel of the decade with the hair styles, general looks of people and general 80s film look. The general 80s film look is good, which is probably what sets it apart from the other movies. I'm giving it a 9 for being fun and memorable.

I am not a big horror fan, but this is one of the best horror films I have ever seen. It is rare that a horror movie is legitimately good or scary. This is not legitimately good, but it does a good job in putting scares into half of the people that watch it. The other half will think of it as a so bad, it's good movie. It is really cheesy with over-the-top gore and death scenes and over-acting. Luckily, it does not cross the line between fun and stupidity. Some of the monsters and special effects are funny. After a while of letting them soak in, you start to take them more seriously. The story of a magic box that unleashes demons sent to torture people is a good concept, as people believe real ouija boards really do unleash evil spirits. A playboy manages to escape the clutches after blood from his lover's husband drops on his remains, letting him slowly come back to life. The whole concept is very interesting, but as an 80s horror movie, you can't expect greatness. Like Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, the main killer kicks ass. Pinhead (played by Doug Bradley) does not make any kills (he lets his goons and death instruments do the work), but he is as scary as Jason and Freddy. Also like the two other movies mentioned, the style is 100% 80s. All that was missing was headbands, Michael Jackson, and Miami Vice. Other than that, you get the feel of the decade with the hair styles, general looks of people and general 80s film look.

As a child watching it, I remember being scared a terrified, clenching my butt-hole the whole time, and holding on to my aunts arm tightly. Because of that experience The Lost World Jurassic Park holds a special place in my heart, as cheesy as that sounds. I know many might see this film as an inferior sequel, but for me personally, I get a kick out of it and still do, despite it being slightly mediocre. This time around there are more dinosaurs, more action, and even more scares. I thought that in this film, Spielberg does a more effective job at creating tension and suspense. Once again Spielberg effectively uses the dinosaurs in every scene they're in, not to mention they look even better. The scenes involving the Compsognathus left me scarred in my youth and it still sends shivers down my spine every time I re-watch this film. The Stegosaurus scene involving Julianne Moore's character Dr. Sarah Harding, doesn't quite capture the magic of the Brachiosaurus scene, but still tender. The Velociraptors are again effectively used for scares and are even more vicious. There are three T-Rexes this time in the film, two being parents of an infant and they are the stars in this film. There's an awesome sequence involving a T-Rex rampaging across San Diego. The film's weak point, as it was in the first film are the characters. This time around Dr. Ian Malcolm is a different man. Jeff Goldblum, although his performance is dry, but it works for his character. He isn't the same man he used to be since the first film so it was neat to see Malcolm become a different person. Aside from Malcolm getting most of the spotlight, the rest of the characters are flat, aside from showing off hints of their personalities. I enjoyed Vince Vaughn's Nick Van Owen, he was full of wisecracks. I also very much enjoyed Pete Postlethwaite as Roland Temdo the hunter and tracker, who was in a way similar to Bob Peck's role in the first film. Aside from them I didn't really care much for the other characters. I was annoyed with Julianne Moore's character, as with the main villain of the film Peter Ludlow, portrayed by Arliss Howard, who now took over Ingen from his uncle John Hammond. He now wants to capture some of the dinosaurs and bring them to a park built in San Diego, something John Hammond does not want. Vanessa Lee Chester also fills in the void for Lex and Tim. It felt like a rehash of the first film, despite her pretty cool moment with a Velociraptor in the film. It feels as though, while watching this film, the characters are a lot smarter than they appear to be. I mean why would they do what they're doing when they clearly know that everything they're doing is a bad idea. You can't help but wonder these thoughts while in viewing. Despite all this, every moment with the dinosaurs are golden. Even though we don't really care about some of the characters in the film, the stakes are higher and it's fun seeing them in peril, and it makes for an entertaining film. The action sequences are twice as exhilarating, one involving a trailer over the cliff will surely have you grip on to something. Not to mention John Williams's score this time around is more energetic and just as good as the first one. To sum it up this sequel is everything that you'd expect, more action, more dinosaurs, more thrills, and a higher body count. It's a fun ride throughout and provides more than the first film in terms of scale and stakes, but it's not completely refreshing as it's predecessor. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 December 2014","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This was the first Jurassic Park film I saw in theaters, I was barely an infant when the first one was released, but I was old enough, and accompanied by my teenage aunt to see this film in theaters in the summer of 1997.

The premise is that Earth has been destroyed by the Drej, an evil race of aliens. The remnants of humanity are now scattered across the stars, doing their best to survive among the multitude of other species found in the infinite galaxies. Our hero Cale (voiced by Matt Damon) is the son of an inventor who promised to deliver a way to fight back against the Drej, but disappeared right after Earth was destroyed. When he meets a crew of explorers, including Captain Joseph Korso (Bill Pullman), love interest Akima (voiced by Drew Barrymore) and the aliens Preed (Nathan Lane), weapons expert Stith (Janeane Garofalo) and inventor Gune (John Leguizamo), they embark on a journey that is full of danger, but is humanity's only hope.With the earth being destroyed and humanity clinging on only the smallest shreds of hope in a galaxy where the friends are scarce, the stakes here are high. Somehow though, there's not a lot of tension because the characters aren't really developed. The main villains hate humans and want to destroy Earth for no reason. They're literally just bad guys that show up, attack Earth Death Star-style and are never explored any further. Do any of the other alien cultures object to their behavior? Did the humans stumble upon some kind of weapon that could be used against the Drej? You never find out. When it comes to the crew of the ship that comes looking for Cale, they don't have much personality beyond the surface. The nerdy looking Gune, the one with glasses, is socially awkward and wacky. The strong aggressive female Stith is... strong and aggressive. The human female is (predictably) the love interest, which means she is cold towards our hero at first but warms up to him as the plot moves on. My problem isn't the romance angle. I don't fault the characters for being attracted to each other almost immediately because all of these aliens are pretty ugly. It's just that this movie's story is pretty bland and that the characters are just way too familiar to get you very invested. Take the reluctant protagonist. He's told that he holds the key to saving humanity! He could be a hero and get out of the dumpy space station where nobody likes him! Is he excited at the idea? Not at all. His too cool attitude means he's always making snarky remarks until he finally gets into the spirit of saving the world (but only after some pretty big disastrous developments). It's not all bad. If you look in the credits you might notice that Joss Whedon worked on the script and once in a while you can recognize some hints of what this movie could have been. It's just bogged down with too many typical 90's sci-fi moments and tropes.On the plus side, there are some alien worlds that are pretty creative and make for some cool moments. On the planet Sesharrim, these hydrogen-filled plants and it's bat-like inhabitants work really well for example. There are also some exciting chases scenes throughout. Most impressive by far are the scenes set in the ice rings of the Andali Nebula. They play with the idea that the place is filled with reflective surfaces and that there's so much debris that at any second they could all be crushed very well. The visuals are quite good and there are many moments where they look genuinely inspired. The film uses computer animation extensively and most of the time I thought it blended well, but once in a while, it clashed badly. It looks like most of the teams working on the film were really talented and one just wasn't very good at all because there is one particular scene towards the end where the CGI looks downright awful.Overall I have been saying mostly mixed things about the film. The ratio of good to bad segments is about 32. It makes the movie more of a disappointment than an actual bad movie because I can see what people like about it. My biggest problem is that there are many plot conveniences or moments that don't make any sense. I have to ask once again how come there are no consequences to this alien race wandering around and destroying alien home worlds without provocation? Why is it that with the dozens of different alien species we see, none of them have banded together to fight off such a huge menace? Why is an incredibly crucial artifact, one so important the fate of the human race depends on it, given to a four year old without any instructions? Why, when there is a secret plan that could really create some turmoil within the crew, are only a few members aware of it? Why is it that the Drej use prisons that don't keep anyone in or out of them? Visually the movie has a lot going on and it gets props for not pulling its punches and actually showing characters get hurt, bleed and die but often that's all it has going. While young audiences that may not question the plot so much will enjoy the film, adults will find it flat. I really wanted to give the movie a shot, having seen it once and not finding it particularly special, but even upon repeat viewings, with lower expectations I just kept finding more problems with it. The music used in the film for example, is downright terrible. Just generic 90's pop over and over. No big orchestral score to get us pumped for the action at all.

I don't fault the characters for being attracted to each other almost immediately because all of these aliens are pretty ugly. It's just that this movie's story is pretty bland and that the characters are just way too familiar to get you very invested. Take the reluctant protagonist. He's told that he holds the key to saving humanity! He could be a hero and get out of the dumpy space station where nobody likes him! Is he excited at the idea? Not at all. His too cool attitude means he's always making snarky remarks until he finally gets into the spirit of saving the world (but only after some pretty big disastrous developments). It's not all bad. If you look in the credits you might notice that Joss Whedon worked on the script and once in a while you can recognize some hints of what this movie could have been. It's just bogged down with too many typical 90's sci-fi moments and tropes.On the plus side, there are some alien worlds that are pretty creative and make for some cool moments. On the planet Sesharrim, these hydrogen-filled plants and it's bat-like inhabitants work really well for example. There are also some exciting chases scenes throughout. Most impressive by far are the scenes set in the ice rings of the Andali Nebula. They play with the idea that the place is filled with reflective surfaces and that there's so much debris that at any second they could all be crushed very well. The visuals are quite good and there are many moments where they look genuinely inspired. The film uses computer animation extensively and most of the time I thought it blended well, but once in a while, it clashed badly. It looks like most of the teams working on the film were really talented and one just wasn't very good at all because there is one particular scene towards the end where the CGI looks downright awful.Overall I have been saying mostly mixed things about the film. The ratio of good to bad segments is about 32. It makes the movie more of a disappointment than an actual bad movie because I can see what people like about it. My biggest problem is that there are many plot conveniences or moments that don't make any sense. I have to ask once again how come there are no consequences to this alien race wandering around and destroying alien home worlds without provocation? Why is it that with the dozens of different alien species we see, none of them have banded together to fight off such a huge menace? Why is an incredibly crucial artifact, one so important the fate of the human race depends on it, given to a four year old without any instructions? Why, when there is a secret plan that could really create some turmoil within the crew, are only a few members aware of it? Why is it that the Drej use prisons that don't keep anyone in or out of them? Visually the movie has a lot going on and it gets props for not pulling its punches and actually showing characters get hurt, bleed and die but often that's all it has going. While young audiences that may not question the plot so much will enjoy the film, adults will find it flat. I really wanted to give the movie a shot, having seen it once and not finding it particularly special, but even upon repeat viewings, with lower expectations I just kept finding more problems with it. The music used in the film for example, is downright terrible. Just generic 90's pop over and over. No big orchestral score to get us pumped for the action at all. I'm going to give the film a 2,5\/5. Higher than my previous rating because honestly, the movie is fun to watch, it's just not particularly memorable.

Sam Niell effortlessly slides back into the role quite well, and should provide comfort food for Jurassic Park fans like myself and others. If anything in this film, aside from the dinosaurs are worthy of your time and attention, it's Dr. Grant. We also have a nice cameo from Laura Dern who returns as Ellie Sattler. The new cast are kind of expendable. I did in particular liked Alessandro Nivola's character Billy, but I didn't care for the rest of the mercenaries or the couple who are looking for their missing son portrayed by Tea Leoni and William H.

This time around I didn't buy into the reason why everyone was forced to go back to that island once more. I thought overall, the film was thinly written, sloppy dialog, and just kind of shoehorned in. I mean after the events of the first two films, it's well known and publicized that dinosaurs exist once more so why in the world would anyone attempt to go near that island. Also, going into spoiler territory here, but if Ellie is able to rescue Grant and the others, by calling the US navy and the marines, why didn't the Kirby's(Macy and Leoni) do that to rescue their son? I also found that Malcolm's excuse to go back to that island was kinda lame in the second film, but he was forced into it because of his girlfriend, but for Dr. Grant, even if he was bribed by the Kirby's, he's smarter than that. But I guess money can change people's mind. Despite the characters repeating the same mistakes and getting into same situations again, the pacing is brisk and the dinosaurs are as cool as ever with some impressive visuals. We now see the Pteranodons in full action and they're just as deadly. The Velociraptors never fail to be threatening and vicious and this third entry displays their intelligence even more which was quite intriguing to watch. The Spinosaurus is introduced, and new dinosaur villain and single-handedly destroys the T-Rex.

I personally think that is arguable, since it arguably surpasses its proceeder and checking out the Lord of the Rings sequels and the Empire Strikes Back. Say this is the best sequel ever and I will not disagree. Say this is better than the first and I will agree. Honestly, I keep changing my mind about which instalment is better every time I watch them. This last time I watched them, the first one seemed better to me. The time before, this one was the superior picture. I don't care which is better, as long as I have 200 minutes of no interruptions while watching this.With the success of The Godfather in 1972, it was only natural for there to be a sequel. The Godfather Part II acts as both a sequel and a prequel, with the sequel being written by Coppola and Puzo and the prequel being taken from the novel. When Pacino broke out in the first movie, he topped it one year later with Serpico. His performance in this tops Serpico and everything else he's ever done. Unfortunately, he lost his sure Oscar win to Art Carney. Yes, Carney was worthy, but put him in the same category as Al Pacino for perhaps the best role ever and he becomes very unworthy. The people at the Academy probably thought Pacino would just get better and they could give him an award later. That would not come until 1993 when he won for a role in Scent of a Woman that was inferior to all that he did in the 70s. At least the Academy got the Best Picture win right. That was a given. Pacino's rival\/friend\/co- star, Robert De Niro took home the win for Best Supporting Actor, beating out their acting teacher, Lee Strasberg. De Niro became the first Oscar winner to not say a word of English. I don't know what it was about his portrayal, but there was some sort of magic contained with utter brilliance. Strasberg and Michael Gazzo where also fantastic, but both did not possess an unknown magic that few can bring to the table.The prequel follows a child Vito Corleone who's family is poor. He witnesses his family begin murdered by Corleone's most powerful mob boss. He heads to America and grows up on the streets there too. Years later, an adult Vito (De Niro) rises to the top of New York's underworld and is determined to avenge his family's death. Revenge stories like this have been done to death, but almost none have been executed this good. The sequel takes place a few years after the first with Michael (Pacino) as the Don. After he successfully dodges an assassination attempt, ordered by Hyman Roth (Strasberg), Michael's fears about loyalty, betrayal and murder lead him to a severe paranoid state making him a deadly madman. If there was one flaw this had, it would be that the antagonist in the sequel isn't much of a threat; we know Michael can destroy him and all he has. One reason the first one worked so well was because the family was losing and audience did not know how the family would regain power. That masterstroke isn't quite achieved in this. So maybe the first one is better.Both stories are less complex than the original, but both together make one hefty team. Al Pacino outdoes Marlon Brando and himself in one of the top five greatest roles of the screen. He leads an all-star cast in what is arguably better acting than the first. With most of this being arguably better than the first, Coppola's direction surpasses the first. The cinematography, sets and camera tricks beat out all the first had, which were great.

It has less suspense, that is true, but offers a lot of other things to enjoy. First of all, Jason Voorhees is back &#x96; and he's on the road of revenge again. It is interesting that Jason Lives strictly follows the classic plot structure (which was introduced in the very first part of Friday the 13th), but at the same time film manages to incorporate new elements into the basic story. This is possible mainly because of returning of Tommy Jarvis, who is now actually steals the show sometimes. The subplot of Tommy and Jason's clash is the basic story driver here, and it's working pretty good to keep your attention.

It's a cartoon based on an underground comic created by Robert Crumb (although against his wishes apparently). It's probably most famous now for being the first X-rated animated movie. Up to that point in time, cartoons had more or less all been kiddy-friendly family films; Fritz the Cat was to challenge this and show that there was another way to go with this kind of thing. It was the first feature length animated movie from director Ralph Bakshi, who would go on to make several cult cartoons throughout the 70's, including the fantasy films Wizards (1977) and The Lord of the Rings (1978).Set in New York City, Fritz is a counter-cultural cat that lives a life of sexual and drug-taking excess. Police aggression results in him fleeing the city and going on a road trip. To be honest, the story-line is pretty minimal and not ultimately very important. Where this one scores is in its combination of irreverence and psychedelic visuals mixed in with anti-establishment social commentary. The animation is pretty crude, although the painted backdrops are nice, but there are some scenes that display an original approach. My favourite being the extended sequence that features the Bo Diddley tune. It does overall have a definite feel that works to its advantage though. The mean back-streets of NYC are depicted quite effectively and its denizens all have a certain undeniable character &#x96; we have the crows from Harlem (black people), the pig cops and, latterly, a spaced out, oddly threatening, heroin addicted biker rabbit. The soundtrack seems to continually churn out urban funk to set the scene. So, on the one hand this doesn't have the most engaging story and it has pretty rough animation, but on the other hand it's so of its time and sufficiently daring to ensure that it remains a very interesting watch all the same.

It's nearing 21 years now, since the release of this film. My goodness it still holds up. Now this film was released in June of 1993, I was born in March of 1993, never saw it it theaters, but I saw it in VHS and man I loved it even as a child. I will point out however, I saw The Lost World Jurassic Park first with my aunt as a youngster in theaters, then I saw this film. In my youth, when I compare this one to the second film, I recall being terrified and being on the edge in The Lost World, but with Jurassic Park, I felt a sense of wonderment and excitement. Having seen the second one first, I felt this one, even with some suspenseful moments, is a little lighter in tone, and has a more subtle approach.All the actors do the best they can in this film and they all do a commendable job. They're not very fleshed out, aside from John Hammond portrayed by Richard Attenborough, founder and owner of Ingen and Jurassic Park. More often than not we get good moments where the trio of leads get to show off their personality. Sam Neill is great as the calm, collective, and stern Dr. Alan Grant, who has a fascination with dinosaurs and dislikes kids, much to his annoyance Hammond's grandkids Lex(Ariana Richards) and Tim(Joseph Mazzello) who are great by the way, one of the few films where I actually enjoyed child actors and their performances, are also at the park and is stuck with Grant after narrowly escaping an incident with the fierce T-Rex. Laura Dern's character Dr. Ellie Sattler has a nice banter with Dr. Grant and the romance is very subtle which I admired. Sattler also holds her own against the Velociraptors in the film. Jeff Goldblum is awesome as Dr. Ian Malcolm a mathematician who specializes in chaos theory. He provides some of the most funniest moments within the film. Wayne Knight, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bob Peck also have decent supporting roles that are served for the plot. Knight and Jackson also provide humor in the film, and Peck provides and fills in the typical tough guy, as well as being a Velociraptor specialist. Now lets be honest here, as great as the cast is, it provides some of the film's slowest moments. Its the dinosaurs that make this film work. Director Steven Spielberg, Stan Winston(RIP) and his crew wisely uses practical dinosaur mechanics and visual cgi to bring these creatures to life. Think about this it's been nearly 21 years since its release and the visuals still look great. Some would argue maybe even up to par or better than most cgi-fest blockbusters released today. Spielberg also uses the dinosaurs very effectively for every scene they're in. The Velociraptors are smart and deadly and provides the film's scariest moments. The T-Rex scene is also effective sending chills by your spine. The Brachiosaurus scene in the beginning, combined with John Williams's powerful score, brings the scene to life, quite literally. It is so powerful that it can bring goosebumps to your skin and make you feel as if you're there with Dr. Grant and Sattler actually witnessing a real dinosaur right in front of you. Jurassic Park is not a typical brainless blockbuster. Not to say that a brainless blockbuster can't be fun or enjoyable, but Jurassic Park is more than that. It has science in it that is plausible to a certain degree that you can easily follow. It's not convoluted at all by any means and every dinosaur sequence rocks, and it'll make you want more. Yes some of the technological aspects in the film involving computers, cell phones, and whatnot are very outdated, but even so the film has not aged a bit. 8.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 December 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Jurassic Park.

There is Jeff Spicoli who is a laid-back stoner and has a thing for surfing. Stacy who is a young girl in need of sex and her older brother Brad, who is a senior bouncing from place-to-place job-wise. There is Linda who is a gorgeous, smart girl and Mike who is a ticket scalper. There is also Mr. Hand, the world's most uptight history teacher.The acting is really good here. The film features performances from future Oscar-winners like Sean Penn, Forest Whittaker, and even Nic Cage. Penn's performance is the standout as everyone's favorite stoner.
