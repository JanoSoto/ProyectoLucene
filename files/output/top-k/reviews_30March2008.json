This of course begs the question of why did I watch this movie? Anyway, what we basically have here is a children's fantasy about a mythical goblin world, directed by Muppets creator Jim Henson and starring controversial rocker David Bowie as the 'Goblin King' as well as a young Jennifer Connelly (who was probably given the role because of her excellent turn in the Dario Argento masterpiece 'Phenomena' a year earlier) as the young heroine named Sarah. The plot begins when the young Sarah gets sick of her baby brother's crying so does what any aggravated sister would do - and wishes him off to the Goblin Kingdom. The Goblin King gets hold of her brother and keeps him in his castle, which happens to be right at the centre of said Goblin Kingdom. Naturally she decides to try and get her brother back and the rest of the film follows her in typical fairytale fashion as she makes her way through the various pitfalls.This film apparently didn't do very well upon its release and I'm not really surprised. Not least because the two leads were not well known (David Bowie not well known for acting) but also because the movie just doesn't work. Labyrinth has a lot to play with from the plot but it all feels very dingy and like the producers didn't want to stump up the money to have the film made properly. Fantasy worlds really should be colourful in kid's films, and if they're not then the plot should be dark enough to justify the tone, but what we end up with is a typically 'happy' kid's movie with plenty of singing and dancing etc in an environment that doesn't suit it. David Bowie tries to create a big of menace with his character but ends up looking silly more often, and while the heroine does face some tribulations in her efforts to get her brother back; I never really felt like she was in any danger and that it wasn't all going to turn out OK in the end. To her credit, Jennifer Connelly is the best thing about the movie and puts in a suitable performance in the lead role. Most of the characters are puppets and they all look a bit crap and I'm sure that the puppeteers could have managed something a bit more impressive. Overall, this is a rather lacklustre fantasy with not much to recommend it for; but it is better than the crappy 'Legend' at least.

Alien only had one critter? Well, let's slap an 's' on the end of the title and have hundreds of the bastards. It'll be great.' And indeed it is. Die-hard fans of Alien may bemoan the different approach that Cameron takes &#150; lots of guns and the Aliens themselves reduced to bugs to be blown to pieces &#150; but the film is true to Scott's original while taking it in a new direction. It's a perfect sequel. The fidelity to the original includes the creepy atmosphere and the slow build-up, but this film has more action and more of an emotional pull. Indeed, it's the relationship between Ripley and Newt that elevates it to something more than just an excellent action film.The final act, which sees Ripley head off alone into the Alien nest in order to rescue what has become her surrogate daughter, has a whiff of absurdity to it. Skinny woman with a massive gun and flamethrower attached to her and she's going to kick butt? Yeah, right. But because Weaver and Cameron play it so straight, and because you've become so attached to the characters over the course of the film, it seems like the only thing that could happen. You totally believe in Ripley. This is something she just has to do. And it helps that there are no attempts to indulge in empty grandstanding. This is just a simple case of a mother going into hell to rescue her daughter. And as everyone knows, there's nothing in the world you should fear more than a woman who's trying to get her child back. Mothers are tougher than any Alien Queen, a point illustrated by the fabulous moment when Ripley burns the Alien Queen's eggs.However, the bond between Ripley and Newt was less explicit in the original cut. But in the Special Edition we get a great scene where we find out, because she spent so much time drifting through space in hypersleep after surviving the Nostromo, that Ripley's real child has died as an old woman. It's a great little scene and gives more depth to the relationship between Ripley and Newt. I'm kind of baffled as to why it was cut out.However, other stuff in the Special Edition doesn't fare quite as well. The least successful inclusion is the scene on the colony where we see Newt's parents find the derelict alien ship from the first film. It's kind of pointless and it's not particularly well filmed or acted &#150; I can easily see why it was cut out. And plus, part of the joy of Aliens was not knowing exactly what happened on the colony. It was creepier when we could try and imagine it ourselves. I'm also not a huge fan of the sentry gun sequences. Most people tend to love them, thinking they add to the tension. But to me they only seem to highlight the budgetary restrictions. You seem to see the same bit of footage of an Alien exploding over and over again. Plus, for me, there was greater tension when you saw less of the Aliens. The longer you have to wait for the attack, the bigger the pay-off because you've been wound up that little bit more.But although the big attack where the Aliens come crashing through the ceiling is magnificent, I prefer the first encounter; the one where the cocky Marines are slaughtered in the hive. What makes the scene so fantastic is the way Cameron uses the Marines' cameras, the ones they have strapped to them, to add to the confusion of the attack. It makes it even more visceral - we see a lot of the action take place on a series of monitors.But this use of monitor footage also serves as a nod to Alien. When Dallas and his crew head off to the derelict ship this technique is used to build tension. But Aliens takes the concept that little bit further. And it's this unseen enemy, and the Marines' cockiness, that makes it feel like a Vietnam War film. The Marines start off with complete confidence and then are gradually broken down by an enemy that is less well equipped but that can adapt to its environment better.However, going back to the way that Cameron builds upon the ideas that were started in Alien, I love the use of Bishop in the film. After Ash in the first film, we maybe expect another unhinged robot or at very least a company stooge. And at the beginning Ripley treats him like crap. But after hinting that he might be another android psycho, he turns out to be heroic. And it's a lovely moment when Ripley finally tells Bishop that he did well. In a film that is relentlessly violent, it's nice to have a moment that has such warmth.Aside from building on the concepts started in the first film, another one of Cameron's strengths is creating memorable characters. No one gets lost in the mix. All the grunts stand out. My personal favourite is Hudson, the whinging scaredy cat who eventually grows a massive set of balls and kicks some serious Alien butt before being killed. Every line he utters is a work of genius. Then there's Vasquez. I don't know what it is about Cameron, but he always seems to be able to create believably tough female characters. Therefore it doesn't ring untrue when she kicks an Alien in the head and shoots it in the face. You believe this woman is capable of doing this. But smaller characters stand out as well. Drake and the Sergeant are great in what limited time they have, and I love Gorman, the poindexter turned good. And then there's Burke, who proves that a greedy company man will always be worse than an acid-drooling monster.

For those who think that sort of thing doesn't matter much, this movie will provide many great examples proving my point about the effect of good camera work to the average Joe.Before you read the rest, keep in mind that I actually recommend this movie for the above reasons. They've all been covered in detail by many others I'm sure, and rightfully so. However, it often gets hyped as One of the best movies I've seen whenever anyone makes a list that goes beyond 5 movies. This is as much a reaction to that as it is a review.There are some funny moments and some graphic ones. There's a good amount of tension and release. All this adds to the realism and is expertly portrayed by the relationships between parents and children and the parents themselves. My main problem with the film is the issue of self-righteousness which seems to be praised throughout. Lester's character is supposed to a hero, and that's fine. But he's a flawed one at least. I think the film tries to convey the opposite message. Selfishness abounds in this movie to the point where it becomes preachy. The message do what feels good were subtle enough to fool a lot of people into thinking there was more here than there really was. Tarantino would've had a gospel choir sing a song called do what feels good I think. Mendes was smarter than that.Still, it's well worth watching, but make sure you're mature enough to see past the flaws. A man with Mendes' talent could've easily gotten rid of the preachy implications of Chris Cooper's next-door visit to Lester's garage (I don't want to give it away but you'll know when you see it). Ricky's emotive recount of how he felt filming the plastic bag is kind of vomit inducing too. But these small miscalculations really took a lot away from an otherwise great movie. It wouldn't have been so obvious and wouldn't have been so forceful on the modern existentialism, but it would've been more real as a result. It could've been a masterpiece. Should've been a contender.

Seeing the protagonist sit in a theater simply watching a musical performance does not sound exciting at all on the page. However, somehow with Diva, it works. Because the music in question is perfect sounding and the introduction of the protagonist makes him out to be so mysterious, as well as a little bit creepy, the scene feels extraordinary. Any time a film opens without any dialogue and simply lets music and action of the characters dictate what is going on, it's a solid opening. It's easy to open a scene with dialogue between characters. It's harder to slowly build up to the first lines of dialogue. The opening and ending are oftentimes the two most important parts in movies. In the case of Diva, at least the first scene is incredibly successful.Unfortunately, Diva, like most thrillers, is unable to live up to its opening scene. After that first scene and a lengthy set-up, director Jean-Jacques Beineix presents the audience with the typical thriller conventions double crosses, corruption, and of coarse, chases. To be fair, one of the chases in Diva is better than most. It helps that the chase involves a motorcycle rather than a car. What makes the scene stand out is the fact that while there are certainly stunts in the scenes, nothing that is done on the motorcycle seems impossible. The audience is not required to suspend disbelief to such an extent that it becomes unbearable, as is the case with almost all thrillers, especially with the ones that have come out in recent years. On the downside, the chase is exactly that, a chase. It's cool to watch, even fun to watch, but it doesn't necessarily serve the plot. The chase could have been cut in half and the impact would have remained the same.I must admit that once the car chase was over, my interest began to wane. It became clear that this simply wasn't a movie for me. I was hoping the main character would be killed off towards the final act. That sounds like a horrible thing to say, but at least then I would have been somewhat surprised by the plot twists. The hero of Diva has the convenience of slipping away from danger and death too easily. It's not so much fun to watch when the audience knows that a character in danger can get away at just the right moment, outrun the bad guys at the most opportune of times. It is for this reason that the ending lost me. The final showdown that takes place in the giant warehouse is more predictable than anything in the entire film. It follows the pattern that whenever someone is about to get shot, the shooter is taken out before he\/she can fire the weapon. I lost count of how many times this happened in Diva, but it was way too many for my liking. There are positives to Diva. All the performances are decent. The production values are admirable. The only real letdown is the story and reliance to the thriller formula. There's no doubt that Jean-Jacques Beineix has talent. However, talent is not always put to the best uses.

It may not have been as realistic as the latter, but it was sure as heck a lot more fun. Despite some really hokey dialog and wildly improbable developments (aim for the moon, but hit Mars!), Rocketship does what every good movie should-- it holds interest throughout. The opening scene is especially impressive with its well-stocked news conference and especially the booming countdown to blast-off. Already there's an air of thrills to come. Sure, the characters are a collection of movie stereotypes-- the jet jockey (Bridges), the likable yokel (Beery Jr.), the sexy scientist (Massen), the stern chief (Emery), and the rather unsteady engineer (O' Brien). Nonetheless, each is played with conviction, and in a real casting coup, there's the lordly Morris Ankrum back at command central.Lippert Pictures was a budget-minded company to put it kindly. Thus it's to producer-writer-director Kurt Neumann's credit that he gets so much out of the material. Note the early scene where the crew climbs up to the control compartment. The opening shot of the rocketship interior could have simply placed the crew already in that central compartment and saved some money. But it doesn't. Instead Neumann has the crew climb through the rather impressive guts of the ship, thereby creating a more believable and eye-catching transport. It's touches like this that help compensate for the occasional triteness.Speaking of touches, how well I remember audience reaction to the Martian girl when she opened her eyes to reveal two blanks. The audience let out a collective shriek. Of course, that was 1950, still a long time before today's super-sophisticated special effects. But I doubt if any of today's effects produced a stronger reaction than those two all-white lenses. (Question-- is that lipstick I see on the girl in this 1976 enhanced version?)There's also a subtle subtext in the movie's latter half. 1949 was the year the Soviets first tested an atomic bomb, thus establishing the possibility of the Cold War going nuclear. Note the pointed comments crew members make about the destructive potential of radioactivity once they discover its effects on the Martian civilization. That would appear to be writer Neumann making some timely observations on a menace then beginning to emerge. On a similar note, Ankrum's closing insistence that space exploration must proceed despite an ill-fated first effort is years ahead of its time, and likely the first such declaration in the movies or any other popular medium. Then too, it was rather gutsy to crash the survivors on their way back to Earth. That unhappy ending warned audiences of the human cost that exploration would inevitably take.Setting aside its strictly commercial aspects, the movie does a lot better than would normally be expected of a Lippert production, becoming rather prophetic in its own modest way.

At it's time in 1967 the film was a milestone, now it's considered a classic and certainly for the action paced drama and black hearted humor it held up. Bonnie and Clyde pushed the envelope at it's time not only just because of it's historical legendary tale of two outlaws it also for 1967 was one of the more violent and bloody films to come out.Set in the early 1930's in Texas and some of the west in the depression era it begins with two drifters Clyde Barrow(Warren Beatty)who's an ex con just released from prison for armed robbery and Bonnie Parker(Faye Dunaway)who's just a pretty small town Texas blond who wants to escape the world of being a waitress. And from the beginning of the film the pair hook up and embark on a life of crime only to build up one by one to bigger and better bank robberies. Though the film is very violent for 1967 it portrays the crimes as fun and full of adventure, it's well blended with romance and sexual tension between the two central characters as both Beatty and Dunaway look as if though they had a field day playing Clyde and Bonnie respectively. The Barrow gang expands when more partners in crime come as Gene Hackman gives an over the top performance as Beatty's brother and his wife played by Estelle Parsons brings caution and slow witted humor to the gang. And worth a note is Michael J. Pollard's supporting performance as a partner in crime helper.Director Arthur Penn does the film as rough and gritty but he keeps it humble. The shootouts, chase scenes, and slang talk combined with the playing of banjo music all during the film and the cops and robbers and wild west attitude style make this a classic thrilling ride of brilliance and grace. Beatty not only produced but his portrayal of outlaw Clyde Barrow was first class work at a time when he was the movies new stud.

Here we get all those things we associate with Hammer Studios directorial flair and finesse, gobs of Gothic atmosphere, lush cinematography, beautiful sets and costumes, great character acting, and, of course, best of all - Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. This was their first horror film together with Fisher - the start of a beautiful friendship which would last for many, many years. Lee has a rather thankless role here as the monster but shows us why we would see so much more of him later on. Make no mistake though - Hammer would be successful because of this film and its success stood on the shoulders of two men - one in front of the camera the other behind it. Sure the writer Jimmy Sangster did a marvelous job adapting\/changing Mary Shelley's classic novel whilst making sure the movie didn't resemble the Universal Frankenstein at all. It had to do that to be anything on its own. Here the monster is the supporting player and the doctor - the real villain of th book - is the protagonist. That transition would not have worked with an actor unable to convince us of his motives, his purely methodical, calculating mind, his endless ambition and desire to discover a new scientific pathway to the secret of life, a God-complex so completely shrouded over him yet ever so subtly revealed. The man that was able to do that was Peter Cushing, an actor who gets lost in the annals of great actors because he chose horror to shine in rather than mainstream films where he undoubtedly could have been more successful.

I was just expecting to view it with an open mind, something that is rare for me.The 400 Blows was an interesting watch. Having only viewed a handful of French cinema titles, I was drawn into the differences between this coming-of-age tale from another country as opposed to the coming-of-age tales that are typically seen in America. When it comes to America, a coming-of-age tale usually has a great deal of sex, drugs, or both. There was little to none of these two elements in The 400 Blows. I appreciated the fact that Truffaut took time with characters rather than blatant salaciousness.What I appreciated most about The 400 Blows was its pseudo-documentary style. There's a scene early on where lead character Antoine is told to get out of bed. Antoine does what he is told. In most films, the director would cut as soon as the character is out of bed. However, Truffaut continues the scene long past that point with Antoine changing clothes. It is times like these that the audience almost forgets that they are watching something fictional and feel more like they are watching a documentary on someone's life. This is a style that Robert Altman would later perfect (Altman was still mainly directing television at the time of the release of The 400 Blows). Adding to the feeling of a documentary is the use of sound. There is music, there is in almost every movie, but the use of music is so low-key and soft that I hardly noticed it. One of my nit-picks with a lot of old and new films is the overuse of a loud, overbearing score that despite the intention, actually takes away from the emotion that is supposed to be taking place on screen. There's a certain amount of elegance to the way that the music is used in Antoine's story. It never takes away from the proceedings. It feels organic and welcome. There was a movie I loved when I was younger called Joe the King with Val Kilmer. The plot was nearly identical, there were several homages to The 400 Blows (which I didn't get at the time), and it was just as effective. If I were to go back and watch Joe the King now, I would probably find it nothing but a mere knock-off of The 400 Blows. I'm a comedy guy.

Harry and his mother have their differences, but they clearly love each other dearly. We understand without having to be told that Harry and his friend Tyrone are heavily involved with drugs (heroin in particular), and that Harry's girlfriend Marion is no stranger to them, either. All four of them have goals and aspirations. Sara simply wants to lose weight and look good for an upcoming TV appearance, and as she impatiently waits and obsesses over it, it becomes the central focus and seemingly all she thinks about in her lonely life. Harry and Marion want to open a business someday, and with the money they make from selling heroin, it seems to the viewer that it is well within the realm of possibility. They too, love each other and are supportive of each other's goals. What I realize now is that one reason the movie was so tragic is because each person's dreams are mostly realistic, and could have been realized.

Along the way, a raft (no pun intended) of unpleasant things happen to the men. Despite the nasty happenings in this picture, Boorman captures the natural beauty of the river nicely. The location was really chosen well. Indeed, this would still be a very nice film to watch, had the canoe trip gone smoothly. The lush forests and gentle landscape only make the horror more horrible. Not only is the location scenic, but also beautifully shot thanks to cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond. It has been said that Burt Reynolds' performance as the outdoorsman, Lewis, is the star acting role in this film. I reckon however, that Jon Voight steals the show with his role as the suburban family man, Ed, who is rapidly forced to change his demeanour in order to survive. In fact, the scene in which climbs the cliff was not a stuntman. It was Voight himself. To cut costs the filming wasn't insured and the actors did their own stunts. The soundtrack is particularly noteworthy. Eric Weissberg's and Steve Mendel's performance on guitar and banjo as part of the Duelling Banjos sequence remains one of the most awesome pieces of soundtrack in the history of cinema for the sheer intensity of its performance. At a couple of other points in the movie, we are treated to more, softer, banjo music which provides a very pleasant accompaniment to the trip down the river For all the good points of this film, I did find it a little lacking in purpose. It doesn't build suspense very well and it isn't really as gruesome as we have been led to believe. The plot itself is somewhat poor and it doesn't really go anywhere. Nevertheless, this movie has enough good points to get my recommendation. I did like it but for fans of gore, there isn't really much of it. None really, in fact. It isn't so much a horror film as an adventure film that turns a little bit sour. Think of it like Rambo First Blood meets Three Men In A Boat. Look out for a very young Charley Boorman as Ed's son. I did like this movie, the soundtrack, cinematography and acting earns it a well deserved 7 out of 10.

As someone has noted, The Dish involves its audience without pyrotechnics but rather through its keen eye for human nature. This despite the fact that its characters are caught up in the greatest technological achievement so far managed by the human species. In fact it is exactly this tension between recognizable human traits and technological wizardry, the ordinary and the exceptional, that gives the movie its soul and its humanity. This is a tribute to the scripting and direction as well as to the actors who convey the essential humanity in many fine performances. Sam Neill and Patrick Warburton have already established themselves as fine actors but their restraint and confidence here plays off the fine work of numerous supporting actors. I found the work of Roy Billing as Mayor Bob McIntyre virtually a constant joy - and one of the reasons, as has been noted, that one can watch this film again and again in its entirety and still find something new to enjoy, almost as if it transcended the label and conventions of film as entertainment, and instead riveted the audience with the commonest human feelings and frailties, conveyed with a deadpan sense of humor that is warm as well as wry. As several have already noted, Parkes is in New South Wales, solidly in the Murray Darling Basin which has been for a century the bread basket of Australia until being knocked sideways by a decade of drought and misapplication of its diminishing water resources.

Frankenstein got picked up by Toho, who decided to give the local boy one more chance. Not only would King Kong Vs. Godzilla be the first time in color and CinemaScope for both beasts, but its popularity would propel a Godzilla revival as he worked his way back up through the ranks of monster mashes to stake his claim as Japan's favorite monster. Sadly, while it may have revived their careers, it's not an especially worthy vehicle for either star. Even in its original Japanese version this was played largely for easy laughs &#150; one character has obviously spent a lot of time studying Edgar Kennedy's mannerisms while another sounds like he's dubbed by Ritzik from Sergeant Bilko (Ooh! Oooh!), and that's not mentioning dialogue like You can't start shooting at Kong now &#150; he's holding my sister in his hand! or King Kong can't make a monkey out of us. The plot is nothing to write home about. After Godzilla breaks free of the ice he was trapped in back in 1955, the head of a pharmaceutical company hoping to market a giant berry with narcotic effects declares I'm sick of Godzilla. I want my own monster! Find me a monster fast! Luckily the same remote island the berries come from is the home of King Kong, who is worshipped by a tribe of Japanese actors in blackface speaking pigeon-English.

The fight itself doesn't exactly live up to expectations or its billing as 'The Battle of the Century!', but at least it got the big feller back in the game.There were plans at one point to incorporate stop-motion effects into the film before time and money ruled that out, though judging by the couple of brief and ineffective moments of stop-motion animation in the film that's not a bad thing. Still, there's no hiding the fact that the Kong suit isn't one of Toho's finest achievements &#150; aware that more suspension of disbelief was needed than normal, they used photos of the 1933 Kong to promote the movie. There's also some very clumsy integration of the human characters and the battling monsters, the clumsy color separation and superimposition constantly turning foreground figures into blue silhouettes. The optical printing is reportedly slightly better in the Japanese version but unfortunately the only version available on DVD to non-Japanese audiences is the heavily Americanized version, which not only deletes large chunks of the original and replaces Akiro Ifukube's score with selections from The Creature From The Black Lagoon and other 50s Universal monster movies but also stops the action dead for long stretches with wildly overlong newly shot and very static sequences with Michael Keith's UN reporter and Gig Young impersonator commenting on the action from the studio while Harry Holcombe's dinosaur expert describes Godzilla as a cross between a Tyrannosaurus Rex (which he demonstrates by holding up a picture of an Allosaurus) and a Stegasaurus with a brain the size of a berry.

It honestly did nothing but bore me the entire time. The movie starts off slow, and never really gets going. There's no character development with any of the characters sans Kurt Russell, and the movie relies on Gore & special effects for it's scares. Trust me when I say there's absolutely nothing suspenseful about this movie, and the paranoia theme doesn't work here. What we basically get is some shape shifting Alien that apparently was frozen for thousands of years, which apparently a group of Norwegians was able to carry to their base, which then escaped and started attacking the group of Americans. That's the plot right there. What it does is it basically stays hidden as a dog for a very long time, apparently not in the mood to make it's attack, and only gets caught because apparently the sounds of dogs barking annoys it enough. And let's not forget how the seemingly immortal Shape Shifting Alien dies in such a laughably easy manner. Kurt Russell and his crew spend the entire time burning it down, and yet it somehow still finds a way to survive, making it seemingly immortal. Then at the end Russell blows it up easily with a stick of dynamite, which for some reason he never thought of doing before. We also have no idea what happens to the Nauls character, as he just disappears into oblivion. Apparently his character wasn't needed anymore, so the makers of this film decided to get rid of him by sending the character to go investigate something he saw, even though the character Nauls knows there's an Alien out there waiting to take over his body. Honestly, what sense does that make? That part right there was very poorly written. As to the ending, it really makes no sense because it features Russell's character and Childs sitting there wondering if each one is possibly The Thing, despite Russell just recently killing it. And if either one was The Thing, why didn't it attack the other? Why sit there drinking whiskey with a human when you could easily finish him off? It makes no sense to me. Also, neither apparently care to leave the freezing area, apparently leaving us to believe they both just die there. Anyway, the only points I give this movie for is the special effects, and the atmosphere. The location of Antarctica was fantastic, and the special effects for it's time were astounding. Other then that, this movie is poorly written and really boring. Pass on it, 3\/10.

As is the case of Jules et Jim, a favorite among film historians and critics. I tend not to agree with what critics say. If the majority of film critics hate a movie, chances are that I will love it. If the majority of film critics love a movie, chances are that I will absolutely hate it. Jules et Jim just wasn't for me. Having an extreme distaste for romance as a genre played a big role in inability to find much to like during the nearly two hours of running time. The opening scenes are among the best. The voice-over narration, a technique I normally find annoying, works wonderfully in setting up the relationship between Jules and Jim, the two leads that the audience has to find appealing to spend the rest of the film with. For the first ten minutes, their interactions come across as true to life-real and honest. The two leads, Oskar Werner and Henri Serre as Jim and Jules respectively, have chemistry that makes it easy to believe that they are best friends. The introduction of Therese, a mysterious woman seems to take the storyline in an interesting direction. Yet Therese disappears soon after her introduction and another mysterious woman, Catherine, is brought in. The problem is I found Therese more alluring than Catherine. I knew almost instantly once Catherine was introduced, that she was going to end up unstable. I had figured out her character shortly before she plunges herself into the water. Director Francois Truffaut didn't do anything to provide enough suspense or mystery with Catherine. Unlike with 400 Blows, Truffaut opts not to use his impressive use of pseudo-documentary style. Had Truffaut used a similar technique here, following the characters, especially the character of Catherine, would have made for a fascinating watch. With a documentary style, watching the lives of Jim, Jules, and Catherine slowly fall apart would have seemed almost heartbreaking, or if not, at least more interesting. Done the way it is, the whole experience just comes across as predictable and a bit boring. Being a romantic drama, it was obvious from the start that at least one of the characters was going to die in the end. One of the defining staples of romantic dramas is the death of one or more of the lead characters in the final act. Jules et Jim was able to keep me semi-engaged with the constant guessing of which one of the three leads would end up dying. At one point, I thought maybe all three wouldn't live. Truffaut deserves credit for making the ending work as well as he does. The death scene is not a long one. In fact, it is a very short scene. Sometimes the shorter the moment, the more effective it works. The ending could have been drawn out yet Truffaut makes it short but sweet. I can't say I was particularly fond of Jules et Jim. However, the early scenes and the ending work well. If only I could say the same for the rest of the movie.
