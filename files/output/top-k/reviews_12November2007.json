The accomplishments in the areas of science, literature, painting, architecture and athletics are shamefully dragged down by the one disgustingly grim reality. And that is that the streets of our cities are not safe.In our quest for civility and peace, we have gone to the path of legislating laws that have continued to restrict if not outright violate our own Constitution.

Now, please notice that the Amendment does NOT say that our Government, be it State or National, may grant us permission, because our Founding Fathers knew that the Right of Self-Protection is a gift to Mankind from Our Creator, not of any man-made body, no matter how well intentioned. And furthermore, it is very common sense friendly.OUR STORY&#133;&#133;&#133; We open up with a view of New York City, Manhattan life in the contemporary setting of 1974.

When they pay for the order, there is a delivery slip that is left with it in the box with their address.A band of three Street Scum Sociopaths (Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Logan and Gregory Rozakis) of the very worst order read the delivery slip and make a beeline for the exclusive residential property and going around the to the back service entrance, they circumvent the main entrance and the Dorman. They then go to the right floor where they gain entrance to the Kersey Residence by announcing they were the grocery delivery man.Now dear folks, kindly readers, what follows has to be the most disgustingly realistic, brutal and out and out sickening scene ever captured on the cinema screen. Because the two women have so little money, the three angered by their waste of time, attack them violently, and violate the daughter sexually, molesting her, raping and forcing her into fellatio. The mother, who had earlier cautioned her daughter to just keep quiet and cooperate, gets beaten viciously with a blackjack, slapped back and forth across her face.The two men, Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) and his son-in-law Jack Toby (Steven Keats) receive word that their wives have been taken to a Hospital Emergency Room, in poor physical condition After a seemingly endless runaround at the Hospital, Jack finds out his wife is in stable condition. When Paul inquires about his wife, he is flatly and abruptly told; Mr. Kersey, your Wife died about 20 minutes ago! With the Wife killed and the daughter in serious mental condition and possibly facing permanently hospitalization, Paul Kersey gets himself lost in his work. Immersing himself completely in a planned housing development in the Southwest, in either New Mexico or Arizona, Kersey goes there in person to work out a compromise about the number of houses to be built with Land Developer, Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin).On the occasion of accompanying Mr. Jainchill as his guest at his Gun Club, Paul is found out to be an expert marksman and having been a Conscious Objector, assigned as a Medic in the Korean War.Returning to New York, Mr. Kersey, while reading through his back-log of mail, finds the photos of him and his wife from their last vacation trip. Tearful and feeling more lonely than ever, Paul opens the gift package given to him by Mr. Jainchill at the airport when he left the Southwest; its contents &#150; a .32 Calibre Revolver.Taking an evening stroll in the Wintry City Landscape, he purposely goes to spots clearly off the beaten path, and hence more isolated from the safety of numbers.

By today's standards (albeit with a few edits that may never be corrected) it could get away with not even a soft R, but back when it was released Peeping Tom caused such an uproar with the uptight British censors that it not only brought the film to a crashing halt in distribution, but tarnished the reputation of one of Britain's most revered filmmakers beyond repair, and he was only 54; it would only be once Scorsese and others championed his classics that he would finally feel at peace before his death. The greatest gift, however, is that Peeping Tom wasn't tossed into the ocean like half of Magnificent Ambersons or put in the incinerator like most of Strohem's Greed, and that today's audience's can judge the film on its own terms. And on the terms it's a a creepy, atmospheric masterpiece, a work of skill technically that should not be too lightly looked on as being as strong as that of the Red Shoes, and probably was ahead of its time in pressing forward the subjective angle of a mad killer as being more than just that.What's superb about just watching Peeping Tom is seeing how Powell, as he did with Red Shoes and Tales of Hoffmann, makes a unique color palette. It may have just been the print on the Criterion DVD being faded, yet there's something to the look for the most part that has the feel of a pulp-fiction paperback book coming to life, in all its bold-faced subject matter and a dangerous character at the center. It's the story of Mark Lewis (Bohm, with a perfectly terrified and terrifying look of a man who can't stand his obsession but is driven by it), amateur photographer and focus puller at a motion picture studio. On the side he's been getting a little too crafty- he follows a prostitute and we see that he comes closer with his little 16mm camera, up in her face, and as she screams it cuts to the projection of her screaming and fading out. Did he kill her? This might be explained well enough when we finally see it, in all the finger-biting tension leading up to it as a stand-in on the movie set becomes his target how to get in the mood for this 'screen test' she asks? The proper motivation, right on his camera stand it seems.This might make for a slightly thin story, but in the pulp-fiction tradition there's also a romantic interest in the downstairs neighbor, a girl who just turned 21 and is interested in Mark's movies. She's intrigued, and disturbed, and rightfully so by footage of his father putting a lizard on his bed as a kid. But they start seeing each other- no photography though- and her mother, blind as can be, won't stand for it (this brings an immensely satisfying scene with touches of dark humor when she is in Mark's screening room unannounced and he nearly goes for the kill). There's a typical murder investigation, evidence mounting, so on and so forth, who will he kill next. This would only be slightly of interest if it weren't going somewhere or put into some heavy direction. Powell, taking off on Leo Marks's clever screenplay, makes tension into something that is relatable to Hitchcock but not at the same time; even Hitchcock never got this much into a subjective perception through the character. Right from the start we have to go along with this guy, as crazy as he is, but with little moments of sympathy that are striking, leading up to the wild, melodramatic climax where it verges into pure theater.There's also a subtext to the material that could be considered, for its time, a precursor to Blowup, that's posed daringly to the viewer. What is it about the movie image, or just capturing it, that moves from reality into a blend of it? Do we really see what we want to or is desire and Freudian sensibilities in the mix? Going back to Hithccock too is the whole deal with observing, seeing to the point where it's like nothing at all to the person doing the looking, where curiosity pushes into obsession. There's a great scene where Mark and his date are about to go out but she convinces him to leave his most precious camera behind. He does, and as soon as they walk out he sees a couple making out in the shadows by a tree. He's frozen stiff- can he take seeing things without the medium? Can any of us? Compelling, bitingly funny, and with an edge that sticks through Powell's fine vision.

She's intrigued, and disturbed, and rightfully so by footage of his father putting a lizard on his bed as a kid. But they start seeing each other- no photography though- and her mother, blind as can be, won't stand for it (this brings an immensely satisfying scene with touches of dark humor when she is in Mark's screening room unannounced and he nearly goes for the kill).

This would only be slightly of interest if it weren't going somewhere or put into some heavy direction.

By today's standards (albeit with a few edits that may never be corrected) it could get away with not even a soft R, but back when it was released Peeping Tom caused such an uproar with the uptight British censors that it not only brought the film to a crashing halt in distribution, but tarnished the reputation of one of Britain's most revered filmmakers beyond repair, and he was only 54; it would only be once Scorsese and others championed his classics that he would finally feel at peace before his death. The greatest gift, however, is that Peeping Tom wasn't tossed into the ocean like half of Magnificent Ambersons or put in the incinerator like most of Strohem's Greed, and that today's audience's can judge the film on its own terms. And on the terms it's a a creepy, atmospheric masterpiece, a work of skill technically that should not be too lightly looked on as being as strong as that of the Red Shoes, and probably was ahead of its time in pressing forward the subjective angle of a mad killer as being more than just that.What's superb about just watching Peeping Tom is seeing how Powell, as he did with Red Shoes and Tales of Hoffmann, makes a unique color palette. It may have just been the print on the Criterion DVD being faded, yet there's something to the look for the most part that has the feel of a pulp-fiction paperback book coming to life, in all its bold-faced subject matter and a dangerous character at the center. It's the story of Mark Lewis (Bohm, with a perfectly terrified and terrifying look of a man who can't stand his obsession but is driven by it), amateur photographer and focus puller at a motion picture studio. On the side he's been getting a little too crafty- he follows a prostitute and we see that he comes closer with his little 16mm camera, up in her face, and as she screams it cuts to the projection of her screaming and fading out. Did he kill her? This might be explained well enough when we finally see it, in all the finger-biting tension leading up to it as a stand-in on the movie set becomes his target how to get in the mood for this 'screen test' she asks?

Although audiences likely patted themselves on the back for being tolerant and liberal enough to see the film, the movie revolves around Kevin Kline's Howard Brackett, who is a grossly stereotyped gay man. The movie asserts that a tendency to dance to disco music, revel in Barbra Streisand movies, and dress well indicates one's sexual orientation. Like Queer Eye, the film actually takes a backhanded slap at straight men and stereotypes them as slovenly, dim witted, and lacking in taste and culture. OK, so In and Out is only a comedy, but even comedies send messages that can hurt.Unfortunately, at the center of the film's humor lies a somewhat pathetic character. Howard is middle aged, deeply closeted or in self-denial, and evidently has never had a sex life. A three-year engagement to a female teacher in the school where he works is described as a series of sunsets, long talks, and watching Funny Lady. Fortunately, Joan Cusack plays Howard's intended, Emily Montgomery, and she steals the show throughout. Most of the film's funniest moments belong to her, although Kline's attempts to resist dancing during an instruction tape on macho behavior are hilarious. He is a gifted physical performer, but the film gives him only few moments to shine. Matt Dillon also stands out as the student turned actor, and the clip from his Oscar-nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical. However, despite the movie's gay theme, there is no boy-meets-boy romance, and only one male-to-male kiss, and that smooch is about as erotic as the one between Michael and Fredo Corleone in Godfather II. Although well intentioned, In and Out fails to address the injustices and prejudices that it illustrates. Howard is fired from his teaching job despite his outstanding performance and credentials, yet little outrage is expressed. Most of the characters are more upset about the cancelled wedding than about Howard's self-realization, which seems to take place overnight, and his abrupt and unjust dismissal. Not surprisingly, Howard's parents, endearingly portrayed by Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley, and his students rise to support him. However, the sugary finale is as embarrassing to the audience as it evidently was to Howard Brackett in the film. The movie would have been more refreshing if it had revolved around a gay man who dressed like a slob, was a rabid fan of football, drove a station wagon, listened to country music, and lived on fast food.

Director James Whale, Screenplay John L. Balderston from the play by Peggy Webling.Based on Mary Shelley's 19th century horror novel, this was a huge success for Universal when released in 1931. Drawn from a play, Director James Whale's film would enjoy the same level of acclaim that Dracula with Bela Lugosi did in the same decade. Boris Karloff became a household name in horror along with Lugosi and unfortunately for these actors, these roles were the only ones they were cast in. Frankenstein captures the spirit of Hollywood movies at the time. The Depression was still on, radio and not television was the only other available source of entertainment and so audiences flocked to movie theaters to see movies with melodramatic and incredible plots (King Kong, etc) when they weren't watching romance or their favorite actors in either comedy or serious films. Not entirely accurate to the novel, this movie is built around Boris Karloff portraying the Frankenstein monster. Because this role is that of an overgrown, awkward, dead-looking, automaton creature, it was an impressive performance by Karloff under heavy make up and costume. There's no real need for him to act but even so, he plays the role with sensitivity and humanity in small subtle doses. Much has already been said about the famous scene in which Frankenstein plays with a little girl and is confused by the game she's invented and ultimately kills her. He is a big child and he wants to learn about the human world but it's scary and his strongest instincts are to kill. The thing is this same instinct is inside us as humans. The best performance is that of Colin Clive as Dr. Frankenstein. He is maniacal, driven by ambition and oozing the classic evil scientist persona. His scene in which he revives Frankenstein during a lightning storm is one of the most memorable scenes in horror movies. It's Alive! It's Alive! At last I know what it is like to play God. This is the message of the film. Dr. Frankenstein has played God in resurrecting a corpse and the consequences are dire. Still, the novel is a lot stronger in this theme and a lot more haunting. This film is sensational and at the same time filled with everyday scenes in a village. The ending in which a baby is born in Baron Frankenstein's home is absolutely commonplace. The romance between Elizabeth and Victor is wooden and underdeveloped. This movie was a hit at the time because few movies had reached a level of horror at the time.

In one sense justifiably so as the Lost World could never compare to the first instalment in the franchise. It was always going to be an impossible task to improve on the first film which had so much going for it and unsurprisingly it is not the best film in the world.In some respects this film does shoot itself in the foot. The end sequence is silly, there are numerous unexplored errors and for the raptor fans, they get a pretty raw deal. Furthermore the Lost World continued on the premise that children would be able to survive a dinosaur attack while mercenaries with guns could not...If you leave these issues aside the Lost World is a respectable movie and no matter how many times I watch it does entertain.What I liked was that unlike Jurassic Park 3, it continued the idea of the dinosaurs being animals rather than monsters. Apart from the Raptors which were just as scary and monstrous as in the first film, none of the animals attack for pleasure or financial gain (compared to the humans in the film). They hunt and kill for their basic needs and instincts. One could say that the film follows an ecological route, and criticises all corporate involvement in animal exploitation.Plot wise, The Lost World is basically an add on to the first film. We find out that there is another island other than Isla Nublar with dinosaurs called Isla Sorna and the now bankrupt Ingen wants to harvest the island in order to ship the dinosaurs back to the mainland. Hammond, who had recently lost control of the company, however disapproves of this and so decides to construct a team to document the animals in order to gain public support for their conservation. He tries to recruit first film survivor Ian Malcolm who initially refuses.However when Malcolm finds out his girlfriend Dr.Harding has already gone to the island on her own he decides to rescue her. What transpires is a 2 hour survival movie full of dinosaur attacks, suspense, action and Jeff Goldblum (Malcolm) attempting sarcasm along the way.While the sarcasm may grate after a while the movie does have some great one liners NickHammond's check cleared or I wouldn't be going on this wild goose chase.Malcolm Well your going to the only place in the world where the geese chase youSimilarily while the plot isn't that complicated the characters are enjoyable. Malcolm is definitely the funniest with his sarcastic one liners (see above). Roland played by Pete Posthelwaite (a surprising casting as I would not expect to see him in a Hollywood action movie) is especially good as the cold, yet human hunter character in the film.The only annoying character is surprise, surprise Malcolm's daughter Kelly, who despite spending almost the entire film screaming and whining about the least bit thing (stereotype teenager), is brave enough to do a complicated gymnastic routine inside a derelict house on rusty bars to kick a Raptor through a window. It is an annoying trait in Jurassic Park that in every film there is always an annoying kid.Interestingly when compared to the book the film is does a good job. Jurassic Park the film was nowhere near as good as the novel but there is a definite improvement over the Lost World Novel in this film. Not saying the book was bad (or for that matter the first film), it was just that I enjoyed the film a lot more. My advice is to watch the film before you read the book. While the book has its moments don't expect it to be a repeat of Crichton's classic first novel.Additionaly the CGI and models come back with avengence!!! As you'd expect after 4 years of development the dinosaurs look better than ever, and still look pretty impressive. Certainly this film has aged pretty well.The moving models have improved as well. Supposedly both T-Rex's in Lost World contained twice the equipment of the previous T-Rex from the first film. Lost World looks great and as you would expect from a Spielberg film, has great production values. Locations look sublime with the coniferous forests, tall grass and no fencing making the new island look and feel like a true lost world rather than a science experiment. Finally I personally loved the look of the vehicles. Certainly this is not a film which will disappoint (or unlike the JP III will confuse you)with its look and feel and as stated before has great production values.All in all, this is a severely underrated film which was always going to be slated if it was not 100% as good as its predecessor. It is not as good as Jurassic Park but the Lost World is definitely a film you can enjoy. Certainly it will entertain you for its 2 hour duration and has always been a personal favourite. So its unsurprising that I was overjoyed to see it move ahead of the disastrous Jurassic III in the IMDb polls. A well deserved result.

Kirk (William Shatner) from the original series of films and passing the torch to the new crew from the TV series Star Trek The Next Generation and their captain, Picard (Patrick Stewart). I think the film has been somewhat unfairly dismissed by some of the old-school Trek fans and people should consider taking another look at it without that burden weighing so heavily on the film.Granted there are some problems with the execution of the story. There are a lot of loopholes here depending on how demanding a viewer you are. For instance, if Kirk and Picard had failed to stop Soren, the Nexus would still have swept them up and taken them back and they could simply have tried again at least until they were both killed. The Klingon ship that we see early in the story is destroyed much too quickly &#150; yes it is an older ship that can't match up to the Enterprise but here, just like in ST VI, it's a bit too much to ask the audience that one shot destroys it. A much bigger problem actually IMHO is the fact that we have Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) talking the Nexus up so much (once you're there, you're not going to care about anything&#133;. All you will want is to stay in the Nexus) and we have McDowell at his usual creepy pitch selling us on how obsessed he is with the Nexus, so it's very underwhelming to see the place. Picard's version of the Nexus looks like a throwaway scene from a Dickens novel, and it's much too easy for he and Kirk to decide to leave the Nexus. It's not real says Kirk &#150; so why does it feel so real for Guinan and Soren? So IMHO the Nexus was a great idea and a great motivation for Soren but is undermined by poor execution &#150; in the end we don't see any reason to think it's any more tempting than the holodeck.However it's all pretty forgivable when you consider how nicely all the themes from Soren, Picard and Kirk coincide in the concept of the Nexus. Time is the fire in which we burn says Soren &#150; and it resonates for us because we know that Picard and Kirk have both been preoccupied with their legacy, in Picard's case a deep sadness due to the death of his brother and nephew. Stewart's acting in the scene he shares with Troi (Marina Sirtis) is fantastic, some of the best you will ever see in a sci-fi movie (though not subtle). I thought the theme was powerful enough that it would have made this a top Trek movie if the execution of the Nexus and the final battle was just a bit better.The secondary story involving Data using the emotion chip was interesting but also could have been handled better in some ways. I think some people don't understand that Data's horrible jokes are supposed to be horrible, and are only funny because they're so bad. But even so, I think they went a bit too far with it. I did think the scene with Data and Geordy on the space station when Data began to malfunction was handled very well, and I laughed at Data's first experience with alcohol.Unfortunately most of the supporting characters just don't have a lot to do in this one, which is one of the problems generally speaking that undermined the Next Generation series when it went to film. On television the series was groundbreaking, its multi-episode character arcs leading the way for shows like X-Files and Buffy that would come later. But none of this is possible with film &#150; I do respect the decision to try to develop Data with the emotion chip, but it's simply impossible to have every member of this crew do something memorable or important. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) gets thrown in the water 15 minutes in and then virtually disappears. The rest of the crew crashland (nice FX with the miniature work on this scene) on some other planet and never become involved in the action for the last 30 minutes of the film.But heck &#150; Stewart and Shatner are great together and the scenes with the 2 of them are a Trekkie dream come true. I like how Kirk's death was handled &#150; the desert planet reminds you of great episodes of the original show that were shot in the desert&#133;. Trek fans will forgive me for not remembering the name of the episode but there was that one with Kirk fighting the green lizard guy in the desert. His last words (&#133;. Oh my&#133;..) are 1,000,000 times better than some dignified speech. And it's fitting that Picard is the only witness to his death and the only mourner at his funeral. McDowell is one of the stronger villains in the series, second only to Montalban's Khan and Pullman's Chang. Sometimes in the later years McDowell played victims too ham-fisted (i.e. Blake Edward's Sunset), but here there's something exciting and compelling in his eyes &#150; it's as if he's searching desperately for something that he knows he will never find. I liked it better than any of the subsequent TrekTNG films because it was the most cinematic and original, had very good music and effects, and you can't beat Picard and Kirk as a screen hero duo.

Time is the fire in which we burn says Soren &#150; and it resonates for us because we know that Picard and Kirk have both been preoccupied with their legacy, in Picard's case a deep sadness due to the death of his brother and nephew. Stewart's acting in the scene he shares with Troi (Marina Sirtis) is fantastic, some of the best you will ever see in a sci-fi movie (though not subtle). I thought the theme was powerful enough that it would have made this a top Trek movie if the execution of the Nexus and the final battle was just a bit better.The secondary story involving Data using the emotion chip was interesting but also could have been handled better in some ways. I think some people don't understand that Data's horrible jokes are supposed to be horrible, and are only funny because they're so bad. But even so, I think they went a bit too far with it. I did think the scene with Data and Geordy on the space station when Data began to malfunction was handled very well, and I laughed at Data's first experience with alcohol.Unfortunately most of the supporting characters just don't have a lot to do in this one, which is one of the problems generally speaking that undermined the Next Generation series when it went to film. On television the series was groundbreaking, its multi-episode character arcs leading the way for shows like X-Files and Buffy that would come later. But none of this is possible with film &#150; I do respect the decision to try to develop Data with the emotion chip, but it's simply impossible to have every member of this crew do something memorable or important. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) gets thrown in the water 15 minutes in and then virtually disappears. The rest of the crew crashland (nice FX with the miniature work on this scene) on some other planet and never become involved in the action for the last 30 minutes of the film.But heck &#150; Stewart and Shatner are great together and the scenes with the 2 of them are a Trekkie dream come true. I like how Kirk's death was handled &#150; the desert planet reminds you of great episodes of the original show that were shot in the desert&#133;. Trek fans will forgive me for not remembering the name of the episode but there was that one with Kirk fighting the green lizard guy in the desert. His last words (&#133;. Oh my&#133;..) are 1,000,000 times better than some dignified speech. And it's fitting that Picard is the only witness to his death and the only mourner at his funeral. McDowell is one of the stronger villains in the series, second only to Montalban's Khan and Pullman's Chang. Sometimes in the later years McDowell played victims too ham-fisted (i.e. Blake Edward's Sunset), but here there's something exciting and compelling in his eyes &#150; it's as if he's searching desperately for something that he knows he will never find. I liked it better than any of the subsequent TrekTNG films because it was the most cinematic and original, had very good music and effects, and you can't beat Picard and Kirk as a screen hero duo.

Let me tell you why.The first 1\/5 of the film is spent introducing the first four characters (two couples) - and this must have been on a tight budget, because they only used a couple of sets - one by the pool, the other in the restaurant.The acting was really poor - and the characters even less believable.Let me elaborate.... lets take Ray Winstone - what a poor choice of lead character. He neither comes across believable, nor does he have an ounce of menace about him - I mean let's be serious - is he your idea of a big time gangster in retirement? PLEASE...The problem with this film, is that it stars Ben Kingsley, who some people would give 10\/10 even if the production was absolute rubbish.Towards the end of the first fifth of this film ,we have some more poor acting, when Aitch and Jackie approach the dinner table, seeming to come across as they've seen a ghost - trembling with fear because they've picked up a phone call from the brutal(not) Don Logan (Kingsley). The acting at this point is quite pitiful and overdone.When you see Ben Kingsley for the first time, you'd be forgiven for thinking he'd just starved himself for an upcoming role in Ghandi.

The murderers search for her and find her when her sister and her husband arrive at the spot and she explains to them with gestures and hand movements about the murder.

I loved everyone's acting and found their performances strong. The way they show the lady being murdered is quiet brutal and intense, though not scary in my opinion. The way they show the mute girl escaping is shot really well. The camera effects, the sudden silence, the heavy breathing, all are taken in such a way that the audience is glued to the film. There is some dark humor in this film but in the first hour only, it gels with the film pretty well. The agitated sister, who is so worried about her sister, gives a power-packed performance, while her husband, who takes the matter lightly, too, gives a real good role. As the film is shot in Russia, many of the people speak in foreign language, but you can cope up with them because there is a translator in the beginning and well, you can understand. The scene where the girl is lying in the tub is taken pretty well, in slow-motion and I loved the camera-effects, the 'plopping' of the water. Really strong.But after that, we are introduced to a person who is from the police and rescues the girl. Then, there is a mish-mash where the story turns way too stupid and confusing that I was perplexed at the end, not with the story at all. The 'Reaper' thing was all c**p and the film became more sleazy. The sister and the husband's role became quite unnecessary and stupid as from a powerful role, their role turn absolutely stupid, and they were more kept as the funny guys. The mute-girl too became childish and a side-kick while the police-man became the hero of the film all of a sudden. I reckon that there would have been different script writers for the first and the second part, because after about an hour, the film became the complete opposite. Its reputation tumbled down and that's the main reason I am giving it a six out of ten. THe first have surely deserved an eight. ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"12 November 2007","score":"","review":" Hawkeye\/Nathaniel (Daniel Day Lewis) is a white man who was captured and raised by the Mohican Indians. But, do to tragic circumstances, only three Mohicans remain, Hawkeye's adopted father and brother, Uncas. The father sent Nathaniel to live with the colonial settlers for a spell, so he is fluent in the ways and languages of both worlds. One day, as the trio of men are out hunting, they happen across three people in big trouble. Cora (Madeleine Stowe), her younger sister, Alice and a British soldier are on route to Fort McHenry when they are attacked by other Indian tribes. The ladies are traveling to the fort because their father (Pete Postelthwaite) is the commander and they believe he has sent for them. However, a disgruntled Indian, Magua (Wes Studi), whose own family was destroyed by the commander in battle, is out to take his revenge and arranged the ambush. Hawkeye and his family, however, jump in and fight for the colonists, killing and driving off the attackers. The Mohicans escort the three Britishers to the fort, at great peril. But, once there, the fort is besieged and the war rages fiercely. What will become of the English settlers, especially Hawkeye and Cora, who have fallen hard for each other? This is a superb movie, with great actors and more, but its depiction of the violent French and Indian War is very real and very potent. Therefore, be forewarned that there are some stomach-turning scenes that do make the film unsuitable for children. Some Native American tribes were quite fierce and their weapons of choice were tomahawks. Enough said. The cast is terrific, with Day Lewis very great as Hawkeye, Stowe most beautiful as Cora, and Studi totally frightening as the vengeful Indian. Other cast members are wonderful, too. The scope of the film is grand, with the finest of cinematography, staging, costuming, direction and writing. As they say, they don't make them like this anymore but the movie clearly shows that they DO. If you want to experience an historical tale of great merit, this is one you should not miss. Just make certain you have someone's hand to hold when the rough scenes arrive again and again.

This cast member was Leonard Nimoy, and if you ask me, he did a good job directing those two films. However, this fifth movie in the franchise, The Final Frontier, was directed by another cast member, William Shatner, and his efforts were not too well-received. Aware of that, I had low expectations for this film, and while it may have turned out slightly better than I thought, I still wasn't too pleased by the end.While Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are on vacation in Yosemite National Park, the Enterprise is under repair. However, their time off is soon interrupted, and the crew is sent on a mission to Nimbus III. This planet is known as The Planet of Galactic Peace, but trouble has arisen there, as a kidnapping has just taken place! The kidnapper is a Vulcan named Sybok, who is Spock's half-brother. Unlike most Vulcans, Sybok is emotionally-driven, and was eventually banished from Vulcan for rejecting the traditional logic of the planet's inhabitants. When the crew arrives on Nimbus III, they are captured, and learn that the kidnapping was all a setup for Spock's half-brother to hijack their ship and use it in an attempt to reach the centre of the galaxy, where the Supreme Being is to be found! I certainly can't say I was bored throughout the entire film. In my opinion, it doesn't start out bad. The scene with Kirk climbing El Capitan near the beginning is fairly suspenseful, and McCoy's panicking adds some humour to that part. After that, more suspense and humour follows, but that doesn't save the entire film. There are some cheesy scenes, such as the two with the creature that seems to be a cross between a human and a cat. I also found that the movie eventually gets worse as it goes along. I think I started finding that the story a tad confusing, hard to follow, and not very well-written, which pretty much ruined it. I might be able to give Star Trek V The Final Frontier a 6\/10 instead of a 5, but that's it.This fifth installment in the Star Trek movie franchise wasn't too well-received, and neither was the first one, 1979's Star Trek The Motion Picture. I'm sure many fans would disagree with me on this, but I think The Final Frontier is slightly superior to The Motion Picture. Nonetheless, I would say it is definitely downhill from the three films that came in between, which have all impressed me to some degree. If Shatner is responsible for most of this movie's problems, I guess he shouldn't have had so much involvement in it.
