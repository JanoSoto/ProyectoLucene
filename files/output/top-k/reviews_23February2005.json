The actors are top notch and manage to carry off the Yorkshire accent, which I know from friends trying to imitate it, is not an easy one to pull off. Of course for the born and breds like Mark Addy, it wasn't too tricky. But of course there are always variations within regions but the Sheffield accent sounded good to me.I didn't have a particular favourite character, each one had their reasons to either laugh or cry at their plight and misfortune.This film is like marmite, you either love it or you hate it. Many may not understand it because of the highly localised plot and characters. But if you can see past that you get a film that will make you laugh and make you go aww.

The main reason why I liked it was because it offered me exactly what I expected from it. It was plenty of action and it had a good looking Angelina Jolie in it. I know it isn't much, but I can guarantee you that it is the only way to avoid disillusion and because I can't immediately think of any other reasons to watch this movie. You don't have to watch it because of the world shocking story. I'm not saying the story isn't any good, but it was derived from a video game, which is, let's be honest, not really the best of modern literature.Lara Croft is a wealthy, British antiquities hunter, who travels to exotic places, in search of treasures and artifacts in ancient tombs and ruins. She is skilled in hand-to-hand combat, in handling weapons and she speaks several foreign languages. The Illuminati, a secret society, is seeking an ancient talisman that gives its possessor the ability to control time when the planets of the solar system are going into planetary alignment (something that only occurs every 5,000 years). To find the talisman, they need a key that is hidden in a clock, which is in Lara's possession. The Illuminati steal the key and now she must try to get it back before the alignment. You probably ask yourself why? Well, because in the meantime she has received a letter from her deceased father, telling her about the Illuminati's hidden agenda.If you don't expect much more but a fast-paced and action-filled adventure movie (you could compare it to the Indiana Jones movies), than this is exactly the movie to watch. OK, it may not be the most intellectual experience of your life, but it offers good fun and some decent acting. And that is also worth something. I give it a 7\/10.

This is especially true since someone may also be able to kill another in self defence, a fact which, considering the bad husband's tendency for violence and self-preservation, logically could obviate the need to rely on the double-jeopardy protection at all. Therefore, by only turning to double jeopardy rather than self-defense to make the film original the makers are making only a meaningless, superficial change. Moreover, anyone with any legal education or knowledge of US government will understand the meaning of the title from the start and realize where they are going. Finally, had they really done their research, the makers might have discovered, and utilised, the fact that in the U.S., general police powers (for handling crimes such as simple murder) are vested in the states, and that while each state must apply the double-jeopardy rule for all crimes\/convictions within its boundaries, they do not all apply it where the original crime and conviction occurred in another state.

Rudy was one of the earlier films to go down the rocky path compared to a football pre-season training camp. As it was based on a true story, it was one that pleased the audiences and is now memorable today.Sean Astin plays Rudy Ruettiger, a young football fan who grew up having his favorite university football team being the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. As him and his family would always gather round the television set and watch their team in action, Rudy had a dream that one day, he could play for the team. However with his small size, his brother and his father always doubted him in his efforts and that brought Rudy down. In his senior year, he was one of the most memorable players on his high school football team with only one aspiration on his mind, attending Notre Dame University and playing for the Fighting Irish. With his low grades and his only job being at a steel mill, Rudy had a bad start as nobody helped him on his journey.After the death of his best friend, Pete, he decided that was the final straw and the only thing to do was to strive for a future. As he made new friends and started to improve in life, he finally got a chance for the team after months of minimum wage work with the caretaker of the stadium. Rudy worked his way through the training camp but was only on the side team. So one day, Rudy asked the coach to play one game for the Fighting Irish. The coach granted this request as he realized Rudy had gone far enough and could only continue to prove all the people who doubted him wrong. During the game, Rudy was called in to play and won the game heroically as he was carried around the field. Rudy had fulfilled his dreams.This great true story was brought from the acting of Sean Astin. With this being one of the earlier roles in his career pre-Lord-of-the-Rings, I believe Sean Astin did a fine job portraying this true story. The movie has its fair share of downsides unfortunately. Since it is a true story, it's terribly predictable but the filmmakers worked with this and tried to incorporate surprises with these moments. The story may sometimes feel very lagged and sluggish and even unappealing sometimes. Sometimes you think Rudy is inhuman with his disparity just to get into Notre Dame with his crazy antics and über-determination. However we see this is all worth it with the film's conclusion.Overall, Rudy is on the list of one of the most memorable football films out there. It has its problems but they can be forgotten if you just sit back and enjoy the film. For a look into the future, I think it's going to be hard to make any excellent football films but The Longest Yard looks promising in the comedy department. Having said that, Rudy will be one of those remembered football movies to be shown in years from now.My Rating 7.5\/10 (A Low 7.5) Eliason A.

Yet in context, this movie must have been mesmerizing, horrifying, and almost pornographic for the innocent early 60's. The concept of a sadist ex-con with a grudge (Mitchum) stalking the June Cleaverish wife and Patty Duke-coiffed daughter of Gregory Peck (playing, well, a very Gregory Pecky trial lawyer) and having the Constitution protect him must have rattled Americans out in the suburbs and the hinterland.At no time did I really believe Peck and family were in danger (but it's 2005, right?). I did believe that I was watching a great, right to the edge of the the envelope performance by Robert Mitchum. When he lovingly smears egg on Polly Bergen's heaving bosom (now there's a fun phrase!), his improvisation with dairy products made me squirm with revulsion (and want to be in his shoes), which was exactly what Mitchum wanted the male viewer to feel--disgust and sexual excitement. It may be one of the best tiny pieces of acting I've ever seen--a perfect cross between intellect and porn.The great trouble with Cape Fear is its cheesy, unbelievable moments that increase in number and severity as the movie progresses. No lawyer with an above room temperature IQ would do some of the stupid things Peck does, there's no way police chief Martin Balsam would not arrest Peck for his stupidity, hookers don't talk in philosophy-major gobbledygook, wharf-hoods don't get their butts kicked by one guy, private investigators don't talk like psychoanalysts, women built like Polly Bergen show a little more than Harriet Nelson, and teenage girls can, in fact, be that stupid, but occasionally unclench their hair.Of course, all this is from the viewpoint of a guy who was four when this movie came out and does lame, wordy movie reviews on IMDb.There is something about this movie that I found very intriguing. It was directed by a very-experienced man named J. Lee Thompson (I think). His credits included everything from the awesome Guns of Navarone to those gawdawful B minus crimers with Charles Bronson, you know, the ones in the late 80's when Bronson was about 90 and had changed his toupee from stringy and believable to fluffy and ridiculous. Thompson was a journeyman director for hire, much like the man who should have been hired for this film--Don Siegel. Yet Siegel was better, and would have made this movie snap, crackle, and crunch as a whole, while still being a vehicle for Robert Mitchum's brilliance.With Siegel in mind, I thought of the whole Constitution as enemy theme and Cape Fear, I believe, is something of a great-uncle to Siegel's best artistic film, Dirty Harry. See this movie--and not the remake--and then the original Harry Callahan episode. They compliment each other--Mitchum's bad guy and Andy Robinson's Scorpio.Now, I wonder if my wife would like to scramble some eggs with me for dinner.

The first of these was 1999's Brokedown Palace, co-starring Clare Danes and (wince) Bill Pullman.Kate and Clare play Darlene and Alice, respectively, two nice girls from Ohio who get caught up in a drug trafficking scam in Taiwan. We can see quite clearly that they were framed (or were they?), but of course the Taiwanese can't. The film spends its first half hour or so with the two young beauties lounging around pools and playing footsie with another rich tourist (Daniel Lapaine), and then, as soon as they are caught, slams them in a pretty rancid jail. We spend the next half an hour or so watching things get progressively worse for them, and then they finally contract the services of one Yankee Hank Green (Pullman) and his wife Yon (Jacqueline Kim), both of them lawyers who specialize in down-and-out cases.The film makes the most of its pretty intro, because once the girls are behind bars, it's an exercise in ugly, ugly, ugly &#150; as would a stay in a Taiwanese prison be, I suppose. There's a sort of drabness of color that underscores effectively the boredom of captivity, and everything seems to be a sort of ruddy earth-tone, including, eventually, even the girls.The acting and direction is a bit melodramatic, with a lot of crying and keening, but overall I felt Danes and Beckinsale both did pretty good jobs with their characters. Beckinsale proves yet again she can do a pretty good American accent (she only slips once or twice), and she and Danes make believable companions in misery. The big surprise, to me, was Pullman, who makes Yankee Hank so likable you end up wanting to see more with him and caring less about the girls. Pullman manages just the right mix of do-gooder mixed with used car salesman, and it works great. Jackie Kim is also strong in her admittedly limited role (and she pulls off a fake accent terrifically too).Brokedown Palace is a good film, if a bit of a downer. I actually respected it more for not having a rosy ending. It moves a bit slow in places, and occasionally you can't believe how stupid or naïve the girls are. But it's an effective drama, certainly worth a spin on your DVD player.

And yet, what he does isn't all that renewing. Stanley Kubrick did it before him in 1971, more than 20 years earlier, in a decade where violence in movies wasn't yet as tolerated as it is today. So in a way, Kubrick was more ground breaking than Tarantino will ever be (Not that I'm not a fan of QT's work, I certainly am).This is how the story goes In the UK, somewhere in the near future, Alex is the leader of a gang of teenagers. He enjoys rape, violence, everything sadistic and ... Beethoven's classical music. They spend their nights terrorizing anyone who they might encounter. One night, they break into the house of a woman with a lot of cats and kill her, but than his gang turns on him and leaves him to the police. He is sentenced to 14 years in prison, but he finds a way to get out of prison soon. The government needs more prison cells for political prisoners and all he has to do is to be a guinea pig for a scientific experiment. The experiment should change violent people into good, sweet and loving people, who are no longer able to even think about violence. Alex immediately agrees, because than he'll be able to get out of prison soon and return to society as a good and honest man. But the experiment has some unforeseen side-effects. He nearly dies and his case becomes a major embarrassment for the government, who arranges to cure him of his cure.What may be the most thought-provoking about this movie is the contrast between all the violence and the beautiful classical music, composed by Beethoven (I guess the man himself could never have imagined his music would be used in such a context). What you see is awful and the music accentuates that even more, but thanks to the music it also seems to be more digestible. But don't think this movie is a celebration of cheap violence, it certainly isn't. If you look closer, you'll see that it's against violence, but also against any dictatorial government who thinks it should control its citizens by any means.Perhaps it is all a bit difficult to understand what I mean and I guess you'll have to see the movie for yourself to fully understand it, perhaps even more than once. Only after several viewings, this movie will get fully through to you. And after you've seen it at least once, you'll agree with me that this is an absolute masterpiece and that it deserves a full 10\/10.

And yet, what he does isn't all that renewing. Stanley Kubrick did it before him in 1971, more than 20 years earlier, in a decade where violence in movies wasn't yet as tolerated as it is today. So in a way, Kubrick was more ground breaking than Tarantino will ever be (Not that I'm not a fan of QT's work, I certainly am).This is how the story goes In the UK, somewhere in the near future, Alex is the leader of a gang of teenagers. He enjoys rape, violence, everything sadistic and ... Beethoven's classical music. They spend their nights terrorizing anyone who they might encounter. One night, they break into the house of a woman with a lot of cats and kill her, but than his gang turns on him and leaves him to the police. He is sentenced to 14 years in prison, but he finds a way to get out of prison soon. The government needs more prison cells for political prisoners and all he has to do is to be a guinea pig for a scientific experiment. The experiment should change violent people into good, sweet and loving people, who are no longer able to even think about violence. Alex immediately agrees, because than he'll be able to get out of prison soon and return to society as a good and honest man. But the experiment has some unforeseen side-effects. He nearly dies and his case becomes a major embarrassment for the government, who arranges to cure him of his cure.What may be the most thought-provoking about this movie is the contrast between all the violence and the beautiful classical music, composed by Beethoven (I guess the man himself could never have imagined his music would be used in such a context). What you see is awful and the music accentuates that even more, but thanks to the music it also seems to be more digestible. But don't think this movie is a celebration of cheap violence, it certainly isn't.

Each builds on the events of the previous entry and will have much more meaning and significance if watched in order. The first film is Frankenstein (1931), and the second is Bride of Frankenstein (1935).The third film in Universal's Frankenstein series, Son of Frankenstein is set after the first two film's Henry Frankenstein has passed away. Baron Wolf von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone), Henry's son, is on his way to claim his inheritance from his father, and receives a not-too-warm welcome from the small German town that has been frightened out of its wits by Henry's doings with monsters. While staying at the family castle, Wolf opens a box containing his father's research records and a note from his father encouraging him to follow in the same footsteps. He initially believes he's not worthy of such encouragement, but becoming a mad doctor may be easier than he thinks.In both the overall tone of the film and in the tone of Boris Karloff's last turn as The Monster, Son of Frankenstein is much more closely allied with James Whale's first Frankenstein film, rather than the camp-fest that was Bride of Frankenstein. New series director Rowland V. Lee has everything played various seriously, even Bela Lugosi's Ygor, which could have easily become funny, intentionally so or not.Adding to the atmosphere are the sets, which are just as grand in their own way as anything in either of Whale's two Frankenstein films. This time around the expressionist influence is at its strongest, but it is combined with a prescient minimalism. While the first two films had strong surrealist visual touches combined with their expressionism, Son of Frankenstein dispenses altogether with any concerns of approaching realism or naturalism. The idea here instead is to create starkness and shadows, often with a maximum of intentional artificiality. It's an appropriate approach that both pays homage to the earlier films and reflects the plot of the present film--shadows are an offspring of their parent objects, and the monster is an artificial man. The production and set design of the film is even more remarkable when one realizes that art directors of the era routinely worked on many films at once. Son of Frankenstein's Art Director Jack Otterson, for example, worked on over 50 films in 1942 alone! It's a rare treat to have three genre icons the caliber of Rathbone, Karloff and Lugosi together in one film. They mesh exquisitely, managing to enhance each other's performances with no one upstaging anyone else. Lionel Atwill, as Inspector Krogh, easily holds his own with the trio (although any fan of Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein (1974) is sure to laugh at occasional moments involving Krogh, since he is so perfectly spoofed in Brooks' film), as does the beautiful Josephine Hutchinson as Frankenstein's wife Elsa (named after the woman who played The Bride in the previous film, Elsa Lanchester) and Donnie Dunagan as their son Peter.Lugosi's Ygor was supposedly improvised then written into the film--Lugosi was originally slated to play a policeman. This is remarkable in that his shepherd character and relationship to The Monster are so well integrated. The Monster symbolically wears a heavy woolen vest\/smock, and has a deeply symbiotic relationship with Ygor that is the core of the film. Ygor is also undead in his own way.While Son of Frankenstein is not nearly as epic as the first two films, it should not be. Its aim is to unfold more like a stage play, with highly abstract, symbolic sets and finely integrated performances from a skilled cast. As such, it is every bit as good as the first two films in the series.

I think the most interesting part is when the two brothers wanted to catch the mouse in the kitchen. They saw the mouse go into its hole. They put many mouse traps in font of the hole. When the mouse come out, it jumped across all the mouse traps and landed on a fruit basket and kicked something down on to the mouse traps. When one of the mouse traps was touched, it closed tightly. When this happened, all the mouse traps closed in sequence. Erine and Lars were standing next to the mouse traps and they were trapped. I think this is the funniest moment in this movie. This movie has an important impact on me. Before I watched it, I didn't like comedy so much. Now, I always look for 'HAPPY' movies when i go to the theaters and VCDs shop.

Acting can make a film good or bad, especially for films in drama genre. A beautiful mind is a successful movie because of its fabulous acting. Russel Crowe acted as John Nash. His performance was excellent because he became the character. He shaped the characteristics, behavior and tragedy of John successfully through out the film. In the film, John is a pure genius who can solve problems that baffle most of the mathematicians. There is one scene in the university canteen where he discovers an essential idea of his 'Game Theory'. He brings the audiences into his world of mind with complicated thoughts and ideas. As I was watching the film, I could understand how brilliant that John is. But it does not mean that he is perfect. This arrogant young man faced the problem of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe performed as an insane person. John's life is tragic. I could feel the bitter he has tasted in his lifetime struggle, though he fends off his fate late in his life. After countless bitter, his contribution has been approved. I am relieved and I am proud of John. Jennifer Connelly acted as Alicia Nash. She shows mercy and love to John who is having a journey of self-discovery. For the most impressive part, I should mention the time when John disappoints Alicia again because of his failure to defeat his weakness. However, Alicia does not give up John. She grabbed his tightly and put it softly onto her chest. She also put her hand on his chest to show how deep she likes John and says, 'this is real' to bring him back to reality. Really touching.
