However, to call American Psycho simply a slasher film, is wrong.  This film rises above all genres to become an instant classic.  Ever since the original Scream, killer movies have tried to follow a very familiar and formulaic path.  American Psycho delivers all the horror, but still tells an intriguing psychological tale of a killer in the 1980's.American Psycho tells the story of Patrick Bateman.  Bateman works on Wall Street, and is basically a rich yuppie trying to fit in.  He listens to all the latest music, like Huey Lewis and the News, and does 1,000 crunches every day.  This is Patrick Bateman by day.  By night, he must satisfy a terrible blood lust.Patrick Bateman is played brilliantly by Christian Bale.  Bale displays Bateman with an absolute coldness.  It is as if the only humanity displayed by him is when he is killing someone.  I think that Christian Bale is someone to be watched and I see Oscars in his future.  He takes on a role which he describes as being, an acting teachers nightmare.  Christian Bale, however, is an absolute dream as Patrick Bateman.  To think that the role originaly belonged to Leonardo DiCaprio.  Nobody else could have played Bateman except Christian Bale.American Psycho is masterfully directed by Mary Harron.  She injects the film with a sort of style that is all its own.  Not only style, but substance.  Every scene hints at the psychological make-up of Patrick Bateman.  It's very kinetic, as it rises faster and faster to an unbelievable climax.  Overall, American Psycho is a must-see movie for those who have the stomach for it.

Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer are perfectly cast as a couple who experience surreal psychological terror that is both involving and suspenseful. Both leading performers deliver superb performances; Ford is flawless in another calm, cold, collected character, and Pfeiffer is astonishing with a vivid, taut performance. With all these positive variables going for the film, it should have been something very special&#133;but it isn't. \tWhat Lies Beneath stars Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer as Norman and Claire Spencer, happy couple who just sent their only daughter, Caitlin (Katharine Towne), to college. The two live on a beautiful New England lake inherited by Norman's late father, in which gardening and making love are regular occurrences. Norman in a busy person as a scientist conducting research on an antidote that makes a living specimen paralyzed for a short period of time. Claire's homemaker lifestyle is pretty relaxed, although the past leaves her deeply emotional.\tThe Spencer's new neighbors, Warren (James Remar) and Mary Feur (Miranda Otto), are seemingly having marital problems. Although Claire and Norman haven't properly introduced themselves to the Feurs, they witness several events that disturb the harmony in their neighborhood. After several incidences that give Claire the impression that Warren may have murdered his spouse, she digs deeper into the situation and uncovers what may include a closet full of skeletons that induce supernatural occurrences within her home. \tThe script, by Sarah Kernochan and Clack Gregg, varies a great deal in quality. On one account the film's story is revealing and tension-filled because we bond with the Claire character as she unravels the circumstances and learns information as we do. We are involved and intrigued because neither the audience nor Claire knows what will transpire. There are a few elements left unexamined, but the production has an engrossing atmosphere to keep us on the edge of our seats. \tOn another note, structurally the film fails. We receive an opening detailing Claire's investigation of her neighbor's murder mystery. The movie spends a minimum of forty-five minutes dealing with this issue, but half-way in, the movie completely drops the subject and reveals (spoiler) the subplot had no significant purpose whatsoever in the overall story. Instead of going somewhere with the earlier plot (which is capable of carrying the movie on its own), the plot opens a brand new series of events almost entirely unconnected to the previous. This structure is a false first act (always a pleasure to analyze). Although well styled, the structure clearly exemplifies the sloppiness of the script, as does the conclusion, which is lunacy in itself even if you willingly suspend your disbelief.\tDirector Robert Zemickis has made some very good movies, several that have earned slots on my top ten lists. I am, of course, speaking of such superior pictures like Contact, and best picture winner of 1994, Forrest Gump. In addition to those films, he has also lent his expertise to unworthy productions like The Frighteners, starring Michael J.

I myself am not a proponent of any of the conspiracy theories cited in this film. I tend to regard them in the same way I regard urban legends or sightings of Elvis.  However, the films account of Jim Garrison's activities in relation to the trial of Clay Shaw is definitely of interest to me.Having read Garrison's book, `On the Trail of the Assassins' and various other accounts of the JFK assassination, I find that the movie only serves to support my belief that Garrison's case against Clay Shaw was utter fiction.  There really wasn't anything even remotely resembling hard evidence that Clay Shaw had anything to do with the JFK assassination. There are indications, however, that Garrison probably singled Shaw out because of his homosexuality.  It's pretty well documented that Garrison was homophobic and this is even referenced in the movie when his wife cites it as the reason Garrison is going after Clay Shaw.  In fact, in his interview with Shaw in the movie, he puts Shaw on the spot for hiring a male prostitute before he even mentions Lee Harvey Oswald.  (The character played by Kevin Bacon in this film is fictional by the way.  There was no Willie O'Keefe) What bearing does Shaw's homosexuality have on the Kennedy assassination?  You tell me!  Another thing you notice in the movie is that Garrison's witnesses all seem to be from the bottom layer of society.  In real life, his only real witness (if you can call him that) was a man called Perry Russo whose deposition was initially taken under the influence of sodium pentathol.  Until then, Russo never even mentioned knowing Clay Shaw, and the name he gave, Clay Bertrand, was used by Garrison as evidence of Shaw's guilt.  (There was never any hard evidence that Shaw ever used that alias, although Garrison insists that it was given by Shaw when he was arrested) The point is, the more you know factually about Garrison, the more the film shows him not to be some kind of Shakespearian hero, but rather a corrupt and paranoid man with extreme charisma.  It's also worth noting that if Clay Shaw hadn't died of cancer (not mysteriously as the film suggests) he'd have probably won the civil lawsuit he'd brought against Garrison for wrongful persecution.  It's also worth mentioning that Shaw was financially broken by the legal expenses involved in defending himself against Garrison's lawsuit.  The film makes no mention of this, of course as it would not serve Stone's ends to make a documentary about how Garrison effectively ruined Shaw's life.The frustrating thing about this movie is that since it is cinematically well crafted, and the performances are compelling, it is also grossly misleading.  Aside from making Garrison into a hero, it makes Oswald look like some kind of complex character straight out of the Manchurian Candidate.  (A movie I'm sure Stone loved...I certainly did.)  Oswald was a bitter little man who wanted to be a big man.  I saw no indications of this in the film.  Costner's portrayal of Garrison was actually more accurate than I expected as it gives indications of all the aspects of his character I've cited above.I'd say if you don't know a lot about the Kennedy assassination, read up on it before you subject yourself to this movie.  In spite of it's implausible theories, it can convince the uninformed of some very inaccurate things.

(There was never any hard evidence that Shaw ever used that alias, although Garrison insists that it was given by Shaw when he was arrested) The point is, the more you know factually about Garrison, the more the film shows him not to be some kind of Shakespearian hero, but rather a corrupt and paranoid man with extreme charisma.  It's also worth noting that if Clay Shaw hadn't died of cancer (not mysteriously as the film suggests) he'd have probably won the civil lawsuit he'd brought against Garrison for wrongful persecution.  It's also worth mentioning that Shaw was financially broken by the legal expenses involved in defending himself against Garrison's lawsuit.  The film makes no mention of this, of course as it would not serve Stone's ends to make a documentary about how Garrison effectively ruined Shaw's life.The frustrating thing about this movie is that since it is cinematically well crafted, and the performances are compelling, it is also grossly misleading.  Aside from making Garrison into a hero, it makes Oswald look like some kind of complex character straight out of the Manchurian Candidate.  (A movie I'm sure Stone loved...I certainly did.)  Oswald was a bitter little man who wanted to be a big man.  I saw no indications of this in the film.  Costner's portrayal of Garrison was actually more accurate than I expected as it gives indications of all the aspects of his character I've cited above.I'd say if you don't know a lot about the Kennedy assassination, read up on it before you subject yourself to this movie.  In spite of it's implausible theories, it can convince the uninformed of some very inaccurate things.

Children of Heaven was my second Iranian film, having seen White Balloon (Dir. by Jafar Panahi, 1995) before. And I couldn't eradicate the notion which lingered on me that night when seeing Children of Heaven, that it was a rip off of WB-I couldn't eradicate it, couldn't-until the very scene in CH where the little girl drops her brother's shoes, and is trying to chase after it. I sigh with glee and marvel watching the poor dainty Iranian girl, in the city streets, chasing thitherward a singular shoe.  Even though the shoe was impeded by a couple of trash in the canal, the girl still cried because it's so near, yet far. Until the man seeing this girl took consideration and applied a lending hand, eventually the little one walked back home with one shoe wet. Little scenes like that, really stabbed within the unfathomable void in my heart, and I couldn't help it but fall in love at that film.  So when I found out that the writer and director of that film has a new one movie out, ferocious jubilation surging against my vein was an understatement.So now, after seeing the film-Color of Paradise, the question lies amongst the atmosphere like a thick fog Did I like it?The answer, no.I loved it.  The rife symbolism, profound poetic language translated into scenes of majestic splendor in the film abounds-rife with pure joy.  After seeing this film, my headache-well it still lingered, but it somewhat subsided. And after seeing this film, I really want to go to Iran now.  I can't help but think about little magical village of the character Ashitaka in PRINCESS MONONOKE(dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 1997) before he was forcefully set off to his quest, the serene village of Kurosawa's RHAPSODY IN AUGUST(1992), Kurosawa's last story in his DREAMS(1994), and in Miyazaki's MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO(1988).  The scene in COLOR OF PARADISE, after leaving Muhammid's school-are like a Renoir painting, its glamorous vibrancy was unexpected before the Expressionist, so was the beauty, it was unexpected from Iran. Now I am one of the many ignoramus Westerners whose completely oblivious to the fact that Iran procured a paradise, so in a way, I was like Muhammid, with all respects.  And I completely felt the father's pauses when he's in the state of deciding if he should consider helping the child, this comes to play dramatically in the climax.  Which brings me to mind-maybe I can be poetic about this and say that the reason why they have that horse, the real thing, fall off the bridge, and be trampled with all those jagged, piercing like thousand knives, rocks-was because throughout the film, the animals were always rescued , except the upturned turtle-which might be an ominous harbinger of things to come.  At any rate, I would like to take liberties of regarding some of the hidden messages and poignant yet elegant way of weaving poetic pictures-to compare Majidi's work to Kurosawa's, and Tarkovsky's.  I love how Majidi's endearment for whispered voices.  It's like his film, soft, and subtle, serene to the eyes, or ears when whispering.  It is so demulcent it can be considered narcotics.  I have so much to tell about this film, but I'm afraid my indolence is catching up like a turtle, for I am the once boastful prestigious rabbit.
