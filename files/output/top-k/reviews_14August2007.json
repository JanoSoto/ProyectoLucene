RoboCop is great. But this one is a turkey, neither cool nor funny, neither good nor ultimately bad. It pretends to be something valuable. But such elements as the fighting between the main hero and his wife with picturesque martial arts moves, stupid taxi service with that cheap talking driver-doll that tries to joke, bits of action without proper set piece as a big macho is running, jumping, and killing some mutants and security guards, while trying to save the planet (is it a video-game? then where is the joystick?), pretentious performance and dialogues backed up by violence (remember the evil character shooting a lady in the bar just to show them who's the boss and his face expressions), too many trash-talking characters - especially mutants - making it all look hectic like some crowd scenes of Star Wars are ruining it, at least to me. Even a greatly executed (visually) scene with the talking female cyber-mask, which blows the whole place off, cannot save it all. When I witness such things, I am not interested in the plot. It is just another eye-candy from Hollywood - it can be mind-blowing (and perhaps it really is) but I don't care what happens next. If you can appreciate all those super-entertaining details, then it is possibly a movie for you. I cannot. What a waste of everything is the only phrase that comes to my mind.Just one parallel to mention here. Does anybody remember the PD shoot-out scene in Terminator or any shooting scene in RoboCop? The backgrounds for those scenes were overwhelming. The shootouts looked real and serious. They were kind of fortissimo. And even after repeated viewing I watch them with some sort of awe.

The only reason I type this comment is that I disagree with the film's high rating. It is to be 5 out of 10 at most. RoboCop (1987) is worth a thousandth buy (great job, Mr Paul Verhoeven) while Total Recall is not worth even a second look (can't believe it is the same Mr Paul Verhoeven behind this production).3 out of 10 (to watch once is more than enough).

Many argue it is the finest example of such a medium. Both The Godfather and The Godfather Part II won Best Picture in the years of 1972 and 1974. The films spawned continuously growing numbers of so-called gangster flicks, most of them not having the same delicate, operatic beauty of Francis Ford Coppola's classic. At present, and forever more, the film will consistently rank among the most flawless; perfectly illustrating an era when American cinema really was at the top of its game.Charting the rise and fall of a ruthless family of high-class society members who have made their fortune through crime, The Godfather remains a story which enthrals and grasps the imagination of viewers from all generations. It is an essay of violence; nevertheless, some accuse the film of being a study of family, rather than of gangsters. Being that, technically speaking, the film uses gangsterism as a means of driving the film's key motifs, such as that of dedication and reliance to one's family. Kicking off with the wedding sequence the film details an Italian-American family's ascent into an intensifying success (and failure) through organised crime. After returning from the war, a reluctant Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) makes his best attempts at distancing himself from his Mafia ties. Unlike the rest of his brothers, he feels obliged to live a fruitful life as a law-abiding citizen, but due to obligations and regard for his family he soon becomes more inclined to join the family because of a number of pressing commitment and loyalty issues.Arguably, the theme of violence breeding violence is one which has been wildly overdone throughout cinema history. Yet The Godfather is a work which uses the theme to the best of its extent. The depiction of cold-blooded brutality within the picture has not lost any of its raw and painful pragmatism. Indeed, it is the matter-of-fact nature of the film which makes it unquestionably powerful. Since the violence portrayed is not particularly graphic, but presented in a way which strikes the viewer due to the &#150;what seems like- prolonged nature of the appearance. Essentially, much of The Godfather oozes a sense of unequalled menace, not due to the violence, but the scale of operatic themes conveyed through such an awe-inspiring sensation of film-making splendour.Every element participates in creating the finished version of a film, and The Godfather is a primary instance of even the most intricate details being perfected to a point of enabling the film to become entirely flawless. The masterpiece provides viewers with performances which remain unmatched in their scope, and rank among a league of their own. How the performers utilise their characters, while serving as a means of polishing the film is truly exceptional. Renowned actors, such as Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall offer performances of such inconspicuous allure that they soon become almost unrecognisable from that of their character. To detail the performances would take a lifetime, being that there is such a considerable amount of material to analysis within career-defining performances, which offer more and more with each and every viewing. The performances are deliberately faultless so as to be valued and studied as each year goes by.The legendary and widely celebrated baptism scene coveys editing in a manner unlike practically anything made prior and following the film. A sequence crafted on an acrimonious feeling of guilt; permitting the work to become even more emotionally engaging and terrifying in its momentum. Cutting from the false commitment of Catholic oath, to the hiring of vicious contract killings it conveys the deepest feeling of tentative regret and unholy guilt. Gordon Willis' foreboding cinematography is a genuine accomplishment of epic proportions. The cinematography is the kind which has evidently stood the test of time, letting viewers relish the profound and unique aura of the elegantly gracious camera work through long, ominous takes and fragile pull-backs. It is of such sophistication that The Godfather compels its viewers to feel the impression of being in the company of an auteur. Next up is the score, remaining one of the crucial tones to the picture.

Cinema has endured decades of revolution since The Godfather was first released, but The Godfather still stands tall above nearly all the gangster films which have followed in pursuit. A gangster predecessor which is slightly greater than that of The Godfather is Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas; nevertheless, that is still a debatable opinion of my own. I cannot begin to stress just how deserving The Godfather is of its appreciation, since it is a film which is deservedly identified and credited as a slice of perfection. To think that in 1979 Francis Ford Coppola released a film more superior than The Godfather (the film being Apocalypse Now); I believe this unmistakably puts his auteur status into glaring perspective.

Apparently, this second full-length animated feature from Disney (of many) wasn't very successful upon its original release in 1940. However, through the generations, Pinocchio, an adaptation of the story by Carlo Collodi, has generally been regarded as a classic, just like so many other Disney films, both early and recent, and it appears that it spawned many re-releases over the course of several decades! So, since its original release, it has had so much well-deserved belated success! One night, Jiminy Cricket comes into the shop of an inventor named Gepetto, and witnesses him putting the finishing touches on wooden marionette, and trying it out. Gepetto names this marionette Pinocchio. Just before he goes to sleep, the inventor looks out the window and sees a wishing star, so he makes a wish. His wish is for his new marionette to become a real boy! While Gepetto is asleep, and Jiminy is still awake, the Blue Fairy comes in and partially grants the inventor his wish, making Pinocchio alive, but still wooden. In order for Gepetto's wish to be fully granted, Pinocchio will have to prove himself brave, truthful, and unselfish. Jiminy is assigned by the Fairy to be Pinocchio's conscience. The next morning, after Gepetto sends Pinocchio to school, the living marionette is soon mislead, going somewhere else, and Jiminy Cricket finds that getting him to listen to his conscience isn't easy! As you would expect from an animated Disney flick, this is a musical, and as such, it has several memorable songs, including the Oscar-winning When You Wish Upon a Star, along with Give a Little Whistle, and others. It's also a very adventurous piece, and has a bit of humour (including a couple hilarious early scenes involving Honest John and the clumsy Gideon), as well as moments of sadness or fright, and some morals, such as telling the truth. Overall, Pinocchio is a bit darker than most other films in Disney's catalogue, whether you would consider that a good or bad thing.

Apparently, this second full-length animated feature from Disney (of many) wasn't very successful upon its original release in 1940. However, through the generations, Pinocchio, an adaptation of the story by Carlo Collodi, has generally been regarded as a classic, just like so many other Disney films, both early and recent, and it appears that it spawned many re-releases over the course of several decades! So, since its original release, it has had so much well-deserved belated success! One night, Jiminy Cricket comes into the shop of an inventor named Gepetto, and witnesses him putting the finishing touches on wooden marionette, and trying it out. Gepetto names this marionette Pinocchio. Just before he goes to sleep, the inventor looks out the window and sees a wishing star, so he makes a wish. His wish is for his new marionette to become a real boy! While Gepetto is asleep, and Jiminy is still awake, the Blue Fairy comes in and partially grants the inventor his wish, making Pinocchio alive, but still wooden. In order for Gepetto's wish to be fully granted, Pinocchio will have to prove himself brave, truthful, and unselfish. Jiminy is assigned by the Fairy to be Pinocchio's conscience. The next morning, after Gepetto sends Pinocchio to school, the living marionette is soon mislead, going somewhere else, and Jiminy Cricket finds that getting him to listen to his conscience isn't easy! As you would expect from an animated Disney flick, this is a musical, and as such, it has several memorable songs, including the Oscar-winning When You Wish Upon a Star, along with Give a Little Whistle, and others. It's also a very adventurous piece, and has a bit of humour (including a couple hilarious early scenes involving Honest John and the clumsy Gideon), as well as moments of sadness or fright, and some morals, such as telling the truth. Overall, Pinocchio is a bit darker than most other films in Disney's catalogue, whether you would consider that a good or bad thing.

Based on the novel of the same name by Anthony Burgess, director Stanley Kubrick brings an ultimately surreal and artistic look to the movie.Never before have I seen a movie that works and operates so well on a visual level, and I am not sure if I ever will. It is a movie that must ultimately be seen to believe.For the course of A Clockwork Orange, we follow the experiences encountered by young British criminal\/rapist Alex DeLarge, played wonderfully yet hauntingly by Malcom McDowell. Alex and his droogs (members in a gang lead by Alex) rape, beat, lynch, and steal just to have their own sick sense of enjoyment, all while communicating to each other in a type of language known as Nadsat. Whether you view these experiences as intelligent views on society or just plain vile and disgusting images, there is no denying that it is definitely artistic, and that is the level that this movie succeeds best on.While the movie is full of violence and sexual content, it is the way that it is portrayed that truly sets it apart. Bright, brilliant colors make up much of the backgrounds and settings, while various pieces of classical music are used as background music. While the colors and music usually clash with what is taking place in a particular scene, the overall experience that they all create is truly a wonder to view.I place a lot of emphasis on this movies artistic direction, and while it does make the movie what it is, it is not the only thing that makes the movie great. Malcom McDowell portrays the monster Alex DeLarge so well that, even though we find everything he does to be awful, he can almost make you sympathize with him when he encounters various problems. Even though you never agree with the type of person that Alex is (or at least I hope you don't), you can truly see Alex as an actual person, and I attribute this in great deal to Malcom McDowell.It is not surprising that this movie was so controversial when it first came out in 1971, as it shows a great deal of infamous rape, sex, and violent scenes. To only see the movie as something of those elements only, though, is to be rather short-sighted. Another popular criticism of this movie is that it seems cold and lifeless, but that is necessary to ensure we see the entire move fold out in front of us like a piece of artwork. Simply said, their is no time for real character development. All that time wasted on complaining about such issues, however, detracts from time that could be spent on one of the most visually arresting and absolutely brilliant movies in existence.

The story of Andrews' Raiders is one such example. These true events took place during the American Civil War and formed the basis for the 1927 Buster Keaton film The General. In The Great Locomotive Chase, a 1956 offering from Disney, the story is dealt with more seriously and earnestly than in Keaton's comedic version. While The General is easily the better film - indeed, one of THE greatest films of all-time - this version has much to recommend it too.Union spy James J. Andrews (Fess Parker) works deep in the Confederate territory and is totally trusted by his southern foes. He is asked by a Union general to lead an audacious raiding party deep behind enemy lines. Their mission is to destroy a series of bridges that carry a vital rail line from Atlanta to Chattanooga, so that the Union army can advance on Chattanooga without having to worry about the enemy strengthening itself with reinforcements. Andrews enlists a group of bored Union soldiers led by William Pittinger (John Lupton) to help him in his mission. The men pose as Kentuckians planning to join the Confederacy, and trek deep into rebel territory. They seize control of a locomotive called The General and use it to travel along the line, tearing up track and cutting telegraph wires as they go. But as they approach the first bridge that they have been ordered to destroy, they realise that a group of Confederates are hot on their heels, led by an indomitable train conductor, William Fuller (Jeffrey Hunter), who worked on The General before it was stolen and is determined to get it back. There ensues an exhilarating chase during which both sides are stretched to the limit in terms of determination, courage and ingenuity.The Great Locomotive Chase is an almost forgotten film that has not retained its popularity or reputation like so many of the Disney productions. It is rather sad that the film has faded into obscurity - there is certainly enough here to keep audiences engrossed. While Parker is a somewhat stolid hero, the performance of Hunter as his challenger is very energetic and enjoyable. Francis D. Lyon directs the film at a sprightly pace, especially during the train chase sequence which is full of sustained excitement. The film is pretty much pared to the bone, so that the story is very brisk and involving, completely unburdened with extraneous detail. There is even some surprising depth to the proceedings - in one particularly memorable scene Andrews and Pittinger discuss how much one can learn to hate one's own lies and deception when engaged in spy work. How do you stand it? asks Pittinger in a moment of anguish, a man clearly tormented by the underhand nature of the job he's carrying out.

In less than 100 years Japan became an industrial power, every bit as formidable as any western country and was able to attack the country that forced it open.Our Far eastern foreign policy from then until 1941 was simply trading concessions with both Asian powers, Japan and China. When they became rivals in Asia we and other countries had to choose up sides. Alternately we favored China and Japan, but in 1941 U.S. sympathies in Washington and in public opinion was favoring China. The island chain of Japan is notoriously lacking in natural resources. Even the United Kingdom which it is often compared to has deposits of coal and iron and that created the British steel industry. Japan has to import and in the age of imperialism, they became every bit as imperialistic as any of our western countries, maybe more so because their need was greater.Note during the film of Tora Tora Tora it is remarked that the U.S. Fleet in Hawaii was like a dagger pointed at Japan. When the island country of Hawaii was formally annexed to the United States and the Phillipines acquired after the Spanish American War at the end of the 19th century we became rivals in the Pacific to the Japanese. And imagine if the Japanese who were most anxious to annex Hawaii themselves had done so. The dagger would have been at our West Coast. Of course the poor Hawaiians had little to say about any of this.All that has to be factored into what you are seeing in Tora Tora Tora. That and more is what led up to the events that are meticulously recorded in documentary style. Unlike the later film Midway which spoiled a good account of the battle with a personal story, Tora Tora Tora does not waste any of the viewers time in that regard.The participants are there in all their flaws. Admiral Husband Kimmel who made the fortunate choice of sending out the aircraft carriers which was an act that may have eventually won the Pacific War for America is played by Martin Balsam. Nevertheless he took the fall for the attack as did Chief of Naval Operations Harold Stark played by Edward Andrews.One very luckless man was Army commander in Hawaii General Joseph Short played by Jason Robards, Jr. who was in real life in the Navy and at Pearl Harbor. Short made the fatal decision to put all the aircraft at Hickam field in the center of the field because he was afraid of saboteurs.

In less than 100 years Japan became an industrial power, every bit as formidable as any western country and was able to attack the country that forced it open.Our Far eastern foreign policy from then until 1941 was simply trading concessions with both Asian powers, Japan and China. When they became rivals in Asia we and other countries had to choose up sides. Alternately we favored China and Japan, but in 1941 U.S. sympathies in Washington and in public opinion was favoring China. The island chain of Japan is notoriously lacking in natural resources. Even the United Kingdom which it is often compared to has deposits of coal and iron and that created the British steel industry. Japan has to import and in the age of imperialism, they became every bit as imperialistic as any of our western countries, maybe more so because their need was greater.Note during the film of Tora Tora Tora it is remarked that the U.S. Fleet in Hawaii was like a dagger pointed at Japan. When the island country of Hawaii was formally annexed to the United States and the Phillipines acquired after the Spanish American War at the end of the 19th century we became rivals in the Pacific to the Japanese. And imagine if the Japanese who were most anxious to annex Hawaii themselves had done so. The dagger would have been at our West Coast. Of course the poor Hawaiians had little to say about any of this.All that has to be factored into what you are seeing in Tora Tora Tora. That and more is what led up to the events that are meticulously recorded in documentary style. Unlike the later film Midway which spoiled a good account of the battle with a personal story, Tora Tora Tora does not waste any of the viewers time in that regard.The participants are there in all their flaws. Admiral Husband Kimmel who made the fortunate choice of sending out the aircraft carriers which was an act that may have eventually won the Pacific War for America is played by Martin Balsam. Nevertheless he took the fall for the attack as did Chief of Naval Operations Harold Stark played by Edward Andrews.One very luckless man was Army commander in Hawaii General Joseph Short played by Jason Robards, Jr. who was in real life in the Navy and at Pearl Harbor. Short made the fatal decision to put all the aircraft at Hickam field in the center of the field because he was afraid of saboteurs. The better to bomb them from the air.Three members of FDR's cabinet are portrayed, George MacReady as Secretary of State Cordell Hull, Joseph Cotten as Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and Leon Ames as Frank Knox the Secretary of the Navy. Franklin Roosevelt being the wise leader he was and knowing that our eventual entry demanded bipartisan support chose a pair of Republicans in Stimson and Knox. Would that our current president had that kind of foresight.George MacReady who usually portrayed polished villains is a good guy here and has one of his best screen moments as the Japanese envoys are ushered into his office AFTER the attack has begun to issue Japanese diplomatic demands. Tora Tora Tora should be shown in schools as a great piece of well acted documentary film making if that's not a contradiction in terms. It won an Oscar for Special Effects which are out of date compared to the later Pearl Harbor movie, but still done well. Catch it if you can by all means.

Streisand, the ugliest major actress for so many decades now (although Aniston, Barrymore, and Tea Leoni are hot on her heels) has made yet another self-indulgent piece of crap. The movie isn't about love in general, it's specifically about Barbra's undying, limitless and infinite love toward herself - though like most narcissists, that is probably largely based on a deeply repressed sense of low self-worth. (Aren't I a great from-the-distance psycho-analyst?) In this dumb movie she is supposed to be younger than Mimi Rogers, which is so extremely pathetic that it isn't even funny any more. In reality Mimi is FOURTEEN YEARS younger than the old the-way-we-were Marxist hag. In fact, Rogers looks 20 years younger, simply because ugly women like Streisand always look automatically older than they are. And anyway, even though Mimi is nothing to shout about (apart from the phenomenal breasts) she is a goddess next to Streisand, hence if they're to play sisters, I demand an explanation in the plot as to what DNA screw-up happened when their parents were making Barbra, having previously (ha-ha) made a normal-looking human female.Equally pathetic\/funny\/ridiculous is the fact that Barbra gets to smooch with Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Bridges, two guys who would in reality sooner vomit on her ugly nose than kiss it. Pierce, the most effeminate Bond ever, looks like a school-girl next to this Loch-Ness monster. The two of them kissing and flirting was like something perverse straight out of a manga comic or something. I was half-expecting her to grow tentacles out of her breasts and choke Pierce with them.

What the f**k? I couldn't help but laugh. When they reach a castle, two guards are asking how they got coconut halves. We found them. What? In Mercia? The coconuts are tropical. What do you mean? This is a sub-temperate zone. So? It could be carried. I'm not going to keep going on because I know that I will not stop. Along the way, King Arthur and Patsy come along the Black Knight, who is fighting a green knight, and eventually stabs a sword into the green knight's head. It's really fake. King Arthur tries to pass him, but must fight the Black Knight. He ends up cutting his arm off. You fight well, good Sir knight, but the fight is mine. You sissy. What? You're arm is off! No it isn't. Look!! Just a scratch. He cuts the other arm. 'Tis a flesh wound. Then he cuts a leg off. Arthur says, What're you gonna do, bleed on me? He ends up cutting his other leg off as well. Alright, Arthur says, we'll call it a draw. It's really hilarious to watch that scene, especially the 'tis a flesh wound part. Over the course of the movie, Arthur comes across people who like to burn witches because they look like one. He gathers followers who are asked to come to Camelot, but then the silly song comes up, and then... You know, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot. It is a silly place. They are asked by God to seek the Holy Grail; also, to stop shielding their eyes. It's like those miserable Psalms. They're so depressing. They would find many adventures along the way, including a castle full of sexy girls, a three-headed knight, a killer monster, a seemingly harmless creature, and parts that will make you think What the hell were these guys thinking??!!!!This is a great Monty Python movie. Watch it and you'll see why. Or you can disagree with me completely and think that it's a total waste of time. Your pick.

The unique niche in the annals of film genres that is occupied by the Gangster Movie is truly a study in one end of the spectrum meeting the other end somewhere in the middle.The Gangster film seems to be one Film Genre that everyone enjoys.

At one point, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta)in describing what it is to be a gangster says(in fine voice-over form), ...we were like Movie Stars with muscle! That must be it, for I can well recall as a kid prefer being Al Capone to being Elliott Ness.In Director Scorsese's capable hand, we have the True Master. His is the mind to not only select a story for adaptation to the screen. The settings and the stories are great.(Being a native New Yorker, he knows this terrain, like no other.) But friend Martin has one secret weapon at his disposal that gave his work the final edge of so many others.Mr. Scorsese makes use of all sorts of seemingly commonplace techniques, combined and then given an even greater effectiveness by these combination of these. Hence, using the hand held camera with the subjective lens, then combining it with crisp, short bursts of voice over, is used to create a sense of here and now that is virtually unseen elsewhere..But this Director does not push it. He knows that he should just give us so much of this business, and then he abruptly switches gears. This is done several times during the course of the film and is particularly effective in getting out a lot of exposition material and advancing the story.Bringing a full three dimensional look and feel to the characters he presents to us is where an awful lot of other film makers are left behind in the dust. Any character in GOOD FELLAS is complex and multi-faceted. Plenty of time and care is expended in an effort to make each character into something besides being just another character. There is not any room for the shallow, the one sided, the 'stock' or stereo-typed in Martin Scorsese's World.So, we see a Henry, who would do a 'Hit', yet is caring and loving in personally protecting and comforting a frightened, molested Karen. Paulie who holds the powers of Judge and Exicutioner over so many low level syndicate 'soldiers' and 'wannabees', yet is gentle and protective to the multitude of his adoring nieces and nephews. Even Tommy, who is clearly 'not playing with a full deck' and could fly off the handle and kill for absolutely no reason, is still kind and respectful to his poor, old white haired Mother.Only Jimmy Conway(DeNiro)seems to be lacking in any real, even half-fast good points to his personality. In the final analysis, is it he who is the worst of the bad guys? What is it that he lacks to leave him so inadequate as a person? There is one other element that seems to permeate all of Master Builder Scorsese's finished products. Mr. Scorsese always has had the ability to bring his characters just one step beyond what we would expect. He has displayed the good judgment to make his characters identifiable with us, the movie going public. This he accomplishes by bridging any existing gaps between us and the on-screeners. No matter how different we are, he manages to bring a sense of identification to us.Hence, regardless of personal station in life (Low-life Gangster, Caveman-like Prize fighter or enigmatic billionaire tycoon) or any difference in ethnicity(Italian,Irish,Jewish, Black, etc.)we identify with these characters.

More than in most other Bond films the girl is not just there for decoration. The whole plot revolves around Tatiana Romanova and her phony defection and so much more could have been done with that. Sharper dialogue and a little more depth to Tatiana's character would have made all the difference.So, not the best film but still streets ahead of later Bonds.

More than in most other Bond films the girl is not just there for decoration. The whole plot revolves around Tatiana Romanova and her phony defection and so much more could have been done with that. Sharper dialogue and a little more depth to Tatiana's character would have made all the difference.So, not the best film but still streets ahead of later Bonds.

It was only Bond's second outing so the director, writers & crew were still trying to tell a story with a beginning, middle and end. Later efforts just became a series of spectacular set-pieces linked together.This is a genuine spy story centring on a plot to steal a de-coding machine from the Russians, but there is an added twist in that, for the first hour, the audience knows more than 007. We know that it isn't the Russians who are pulling the strings but Spectre and Bond is just being used.So, what's the let-down? It's the inter-play between the two main characters.
