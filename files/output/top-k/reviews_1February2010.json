The story is easy to understand because there are many action scenes. Many instruments are performed to show the emotion of characters and help the audience to understand the feeling of scenes. For example, in the romantic scene when the main character went to help the lover, the piano was performs in the romantic tune. In addition, there are many jokes which are showed by the main character. These jokes make the movie more attractive because they entertain the audience by combining with many kinds of instruments in appropriate way. Moreover, the action scene that the main character chased the another army to help the lover was very excited ,and I like the ideas of both to obstruct each other during driving the train.

I don't think that there are many people in Hollywood that have Lynch's ability or state of mind and I guess that's why I admired this film.My Introduction to Screen writing professor probably would have labeled the plot of Blue Velvet as episodic, meaning that random things keep happening to the main characters, instead of things happening or 'growing' out of necessity. I may be inclined to agree with that thought, but in this case, I don't think it's a bad thing. In a way, the main character's random stumbling around town makes sense in regard to the style of this movie; Lynch has made the story flow like a bad dream, almost psychedelically.After watching the movie, I couldn't help but tune in to some of the making-of documentary on my DVD's special features, to try to get a little insight. Somebody in the documentary clip mentioned how Lynch has sort of become America's Luis Bunel, and I can sort of see that. I watched Bunel's Tristana (1970) for a Spanish film class and I remember how it was full of very strange camera shots and symbolic references in his random standoutish tactics (for example, the phallic bell that turned out to be the decapitated head of a lustful father-figure). Anyway, Lynch seems to have locked on to a similar mentality about how to create a strange and gloomy, confusing world by using odd film techniques. In fact, later on in the documentary on Blue Velvet, somebody else mention the term American Surrealism, which, yeah, makes sense.Dennis Hopper had just finished rehab before making this movie. Apparently, his agent begged him not to play this role because of the probable negative image it would portray of him, and I can see why. Hopper was very scary and a crazy bad guy who did a wonderful (or awful?!) performance. What a creepy part! Isabella Rossini is also a person of interest in this movie because she too is one of the eerie mysterious characters wrapped up in the dark plot. She realistically portrays insanity as well as personified, messed-up sexual desires. We can't help but wonder how her character ended up being so crazy-- was it caused by drugs or getting involved with the wrong people or the trauma inflicted by Hopper's character? Whatever the cause, damn.Throughout the movie, the line It's a strange world kept on being repeated in different settings by different people. And I think that sums up Lynch's take on our world, at least as he showed it to us in Blue Velvet. He certainly likes to create these weird and crazy people and events, but he never explicitly answers our questions to solve the mystery. I suppose that for a lot of people, this can get on their nerves. His style is definitely not for everyone. But if you're into weird stories and are up for a unique and interesting style, I recommend this movie. It's at the minimum unforgettable.

But, really was it the worst movie? I disagree. Mainly because even though Wood, Jr.'s intentions may have been to make a serious Sci-Fi horror, while combining a bunch of the genre's creations, and as crazy as he might have been, he must've known that this movie was just fluff and not Oscar material. I've seen a lot, and I mean A LOT worse than this, mainly because they were trying to be serious and were trying to get awards. I doubt the awards season ever entered Wood Jr.'s mind.That said, wow, WOW, this movie was hilariously bad. Incoherent scenes and characters, laugh-out-loud horrible dialogue, funny special effects and the cast seems so, well, dumbfounded on what to do on the set. That's not the end of how bad this movie was, just the beginning. Costumes from outer space that were either made from 10-year-old King Arthur fans or just rented and had no business on space aliens. Also, it had sets, namely that main graveyard or the cockpit, that were so funny, so deliciously bad, you can't help but laugh again and again. I could go on and on, but suffice to say, this is thee perfect example of how NOT to make a movie. In fact, nothing at all works here. Nothing, but, again, humor for the audience. (Side Note best to watch it via Rifftrax, though I know it doesn't need much help; they just make it all the more enjoyable.) I guess the well over-stuffed and confused plot involves an elevated alien race landing\/hovering in the skies who's deep plan is to raise the dead in order to prove their existence to Earthlings who apparently don't believe the fake saucers in the air are real due to the government cover up. Some humans are attempting to undercover the conspiracy, but must battle 3 zombies\/skeletons and intellectual aliens. (Unfortunately, they never meet the head, and enormously flamboyant leader &#x96; I would've liked to see that meeting.) I am not sure if books have been written on this movie, but I can see volumes written dissecting this movie. (I bet Wood Jr. didn't see that coming.) But there are so many aspects to scrutinize on the different scenes or dialogue that didn't work or the characters, namely the long-nailed, 2 inch waist of Vampira or the mouth-breather Tor or Bela and his cape &#x96; something that would work in Dracula, but here was obviously used to cover up that it wasn't him half the time.How could anyone hate this movie? It's the main definition of so-bad-it's good. I'm actually awarding this a full star higher than the bottom of the barrel 1-star, because of the enjoyment I got from watching it. Never before have I ever seen such a mess, embarrassment or perfect movie to watch while under the influence. And again, if you can purchase the Rifftrax audio commentary, it's a welcome addition to the already fun experience.
