The storyline should have been really riveting, but it was so pedestrian with the way they went along with it. The serial killer himself (Vincent D'Onofrio) is rather scary, and we do get some very striking visuals, but I just got bored with it after a while. It's all style and very little substance in my opinion. I also had trouble with the pacing. It flagged quite a bit in the middle, and my interest only perked up for the interaction between Vince Vaugh & Jennifer Lopez. It doesn't have that much suspense, when it should have a plethora of it. You have a really unique plot here, TAKE ADVANTAGE! It's watchable, but not very entertaining when all is said and done. Jennifer Lopez is adequate here, but also slightly inconsistent. I thought she was too blasé when it came to certain situations and I would have liked her to amp up her intensity. She's certainly easy on the eyes, and she nailed her scenes with Vaughn, but I thought she was off and on. Vince Vaughn has been middling with lame comedies for so many years now, I honestly forgot how good of a serious actor he can be. I enjoyed his intense show here, and he was the main reason that kept me watching, and I'm no Vince Vaughn fan. I don't care for the guy at all, but he has the ability to be a good actor when he wants to. Vincent D'Onofrio is one creepy dude and gave a solid show as the killer. He'll keep your attention, that's for sure. The acting (aside from Lopez's inconsistencies) isn't the problem hereFinal Thoughts It was alright.

Meanwhile later on in the movie we meet another girl called Jenny who finds Oliver tangled up in wires as Oliver was teaming up with the irritating dog who later has a thing for a poodle(voiced by another singer Bette Midler) that belongs to Jenny.But who will Oliver choose; Dodger the dog and his owner Fagin(voiced by Dom Deluise) and the other mutts or Jenny the sweet and innocent red head that you cannot help but love?Bottom line I loved this movie since I was a child and to this day I still have it on VHS all the time and it never fails to bring a tear in my eye(yes you gotta be a cynical moron not to cry over this movie).The songs were great especially Billy Joel's song Why Should I Worry and the other song In Good Company sung by the little girl Jenny.This movie was witty,cute,sad,entertaining and a feel good movie.For that I'm giving it an 8 out of 10.

The title is a little misleading. It makes the film sound like nothing more than a dumb testosterone flick but in actuality, it's a thrilling, intense look at masculinity and individuality.The story of this film is that of a unhappy, lonely man who works as an automobile company employee and is only referred to in the film as The Narrator. He's not enjoying his job, he has insomnia, and he has to go to support groups just to be able to sleep. His life pretty much sucks until he meets Tyler Durden, who is the embodiment of everything the Narrator wishes to be. He's cool, laidback, dresses like a movie star, has a buff body, and most of all, free from consumerism. They quickly form a friendship and one night, they fought each other just for the heck of it and ended up really enjoying so they form a fight club for men to take out their frustrations with their fists. The club gets more and more members overtime so Tyler comes up with Project Mayhem, a plan to bomb buildings with credit card companies'recordings.What makes this film so great is how both inviting and disturbing it is. At first, when The Narrator meets Tyler Durden, we see and understand their problems with society because it's actually a very common frustration normal people have. Because of this, it allows us to at least understand where these people are coming from and be able to sitback and enjoy the first half until the second half comes along and gets really freaking dark and intense.The second half is when it gets dark and disturbing. Instead of them just beating the sh!t out of each other in a basement, they decide to freaking blow up buildings! At this point, you could either be completely disgusted with their behavior, or disagree with their methods but still understand their position, or completely agree with everything they do(minority). But whether or not you agree with their behavior, you still feel sympathy towards the Narrator because he's just a normal guy who happened to have a messed up mental conditioning and he's never EVIL in this movie, he's just frustrated in a lifestyle he doesn't enjoy. So this movie does get pretty darn intense because you care for him.The directing and acting in this film is superb! David Fincher is considered to be one of the greatest filmmakers of our time and he definitely lives up to the hype in this movie! The way he uses narration, quick-cuts, and CGI-animated sequences is amazing! He makes the audience feel just as lost and confused as The Narrator does in this film because of these things and a mediocre director would've just played generic suspenseful music but Fincher adds style and panache to what could have been just a generic psychological thriller.Everyone does a solid job in this movie. From Edward Norton playing his role with cynicism and frustration, to Brad Pitt making Tyler Durden a surprisingly likable and charming character that is both cool and terrifying, and Helena Bonham Carter who makes her character quirky and kinda funny. All in all, the acting in this film is great!Lastly, this film brings up a lot of thought-provoking questions. Can you actually be your own man in a world this corporate? Do people really need to be freed from their jobs such as construction workers, waiters, cooks, taxi drivers, and teachers to do their own thing? And is there such thing as true freedom? These are all really thought-provoking questions and you'll definitely be thinking about these things after watching this film.Overall, this is an intelligent, intense film that really makes us think about our positions in life and because of that, I'm gonna give it a 10\/10.

But its subject matter and the way it deals with a pretty - if needlessly - controversial topic is noteworthy and a plausible entertainment diversion. In current times, few other controversial films about risqué subjects are this amusing to watch unfold.The plot Joanna (Katharine Houghton) is your typical, all- American white girl, pure, innocent, and smiley. She is vacationing in Hawaii when she meets Dr. John Wayde Prentice Jr. (Sidney Poitier), an intelligent black doctor with a laundry-list of accolades. The film opens with them returning to San Francisco on a whim to meet Joanna's parents. She doesn't believe they'll be surprised; her parents (Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn) are known to be very liberal people (so liberal there's an image of FDR on her father's desk). He, on the other hand, knows for a fact they'll be shocked. Sure enough, they are - her mother can barely keep her jaw closed when John is in her house. Her father is a tad more optimistic at first, but when his daughter drops the bomb that they plan on marrying asap, both her parents must come to a decision over dinner. Anyone for cocktails?This is the perfect example of a film that doesn't age particularly well. The United States of America in 2013 has evolved greatly from very close-minded notions\/attitudes about race into a very accepting, liberal state of mind for the most part. Few stop and stare on the streets when they see a white woman join hands with a black man or vice-versa. The mindset and the notions in the 1960's of interracial relationships and are understandable now, and calling the attitudes of the characters in this film unrealistic is a critique of culture - not the film. Their attitudes are simply akin to that of people in the respected time-period; in this case, the late 1960's during the ongoing Civil Rights movement in America.It's also obvious this is totally a plot set up specifically for a film. It's realistic in a sense, but even some instances are carried a bit past believability. However, the way Guess Who's Coming to Dinner questions your ethics and plays with your emotions is an admirable rarity. It allows one to ask themselves if they had a daughter who dated outside her race if they'd consent to the relationship. How long would it take you to come to a decision of whether or not to allow them to do it? Do personal achievements and accomplishments of your daughter's partner come second if he's not of your race?Moreover, when it comes to these race-parables, acting can really make or break the film and its subject matter. Thankfully, A- listers such as Poitier, Houghton, Hepburn, and Tracy make this a bearable affair. It clearly too a reasonable level of comfortableness to get adjusted to the material provided here, allowing the actors their ability to express and convince, and thankfully the immediate awkwardness wears off rather quickly.The biggest problem with Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is its very sanctimonious and often plays like a statement from the Why Can't We All Just Get Along? committee. However, strong performances, some truly great memorable longs, and constant questioning of ethics make this film stronger than it may have initially been. Race is a subject that constantly shifts focus in terms of how we view it, how we portray it, and how we accept it. If current films age as poorly as this one, I'm curious how I'll view films like Do the Right Thing, ones I currently hail as audacious masterpieces.

When I heard about this film and its epic mosaic of various Los Angeles characters, I couldn't wait to watch it. Now, I wish I could get my three hours back. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.One of the things I hated most about it was that the opening 30 minutes was amazingly great. It starts off epic and all goes downhill from there. We are shown three urban legends, followed by an introduction of all the characters set to Three Dog Night's One. We see a game show host (Philip Baker Hall), a kid contestant (Jeremy Blackman), a former contestant now an adult (William H. Macy), a dying man (Jason Robards), his gold digging wife (Julianne Moore), his nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman), his estranged womanizing son (Tom Cruise), an LAPD officer (John C. Reilly), and the crack head he goes on a date with.The story, you ask? There was no story. Just random people saying the f-word over and over again. At first it was just boring, but then it became painful to watch. It doesn't help that these are the dumbest characters I have ever seen. There wasn't a single action done by them that was realistic. From the kid who pees his pants instead of going to a bathroom, to the wife who barely reacts when she finds out her husband molested their daughter. None of the people were interesting and the film gave me no reason to care about them. The last 20 minutes of the story goes from boring to completely absurd. The route Paul Thomas Anderson decides to go is way too gimmicky. Without giving too much away, he ended the movie in a way that had no point and proceeded to make the entire film pointless.In the end, there was no closure. None of the characters connected in any noticeable way. Nobody ended up changing. I had so many questions that I could have filled up the entire discussion boards with them, if I cared enough to find out the answers, which I didn't. The message isn't even clear, which is a big problem if your film is supposed to be a 'message movie'. The best I can come up with is You can't change the past, so learn from it, no matter how bad you are. Mr. Anderson thinks he is so revolutionary, but it's the exact same moral as The Lion King, except five times more cynical.My film studies teacher once asked me what I thought of the brilliant ending (her words) and I responded I was still trying to figure out why Julianne Moore was cursing in the pharmacy earlier. This movie was two hours too long and far too unfocused, not to mentioned pretentious. Paul Thomas Anderson thinks he is so clever with his symbolic use of numbers, age-old twists, and shallow philosophy, even though they had been done before.Was there anything redeeming about the movie? Well, the soundtrack by Aimee Mann was great, both her songs and the tracks by other artists, but it was so overbearing and out of place at times that I could barely make out the dialog. John C. Reilly's police officer character was good, but he kept making ridiculously stupid decisions over and over. I kept wondering if I would like to see any of the segments expanded into its own film, I couldn't think a single one that I would pay to see.This is not a good film.

In addition to that, it's an insufferably boring film to sit through!Based on the novel of the same name, the story of To Kill A Mockingbird is set in a fictional American town during the 1930s and concerns a respected lawyer & his family who faces a backlash from his society when he agrees to defend a young black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Through the trial, the racial attitude in town's society is exposed.Directed by Robert Mulligan, it is surprising that the first half of the film doesn't even feature anything related to the case, which itself surfaces very late into the story. Maybe this movie isn't a courtroom drama after all, maybe it's more about the loss of childhood innocence & stuff like that but that's not what I was looking forward to after having heard so much praise about it.Set pieces do carry an authentic feel of its timeline & location. The whole drama is captured in crisp black n white and even the night scenes are brightly lit. Editing unfolds its story at a slow pace which becomes a pain to sit through if, like me, you were expecting a customary courtroom drama and ended up with whatever this is. However, its theme of how prejudice can blind an entire society is effectively handled.Coming to the performances, the cast of To Kill A Mockingbird comprises of Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Phillip Alford, Brock Peters & Robert Duvall in what is his acting debut. Peck is definitely the show-stealer here for his performance as the righteous lawyer is very down- to-earth & impressive, plus that summation speech from him in the courthouse is an instant classic moment, but that same level of commitment is missing from the rest of the cast.Badham & Alford play the two kids whose journey this film is probably about but they utter their lines as if reading from a wall in front of them, that too with blank expressions. Peters does fine with what he's provided as Tom, the convicted black man. Duvall's debut work is nothing special for all he is supposed to do in this film is to show up at a particular moment & then disappear once again. However, Crahan Denton does justice to his white trash character.On an overall scale, To Kill A Mockingbird shouldn't even be classified as courtroom drama when it is something else entirely. Its #1 ranking in the AFI Top !0 Courtroom Dramas is the very reason why I was intrigued to check it out in the first place but to find that part in such a small dose & the story being more inclined towards those kids than the case at hand was both disappointing & frustrating. Overlong & tedious for the most part, this isn't the movie I was looking forward to. Greatest courtroom drama, my ass!

However, its theme of how prejudice can blind an entire society is effectively handled.Coming to the performances, the cast of To Kill A Mockingbird comprises of Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Phillip Alford, Brock Peters & Robert Duvall in what is his acting debut. Peck is definitely the show-stealer here for his performance as the righteous lawyer is very down- to-earth & impressive, plus that summation speech from him in the courthouse is an instant classic moment, but that same level of commitment is missing from the rest of the cast.Badham & Alford play the two kids whose journey this film is probably about but they utter their lines as if reading from a wall in front of them, that too with blank expressions. Peters does fine with what he's provided as Tom, the convicted black man. Duvall's debut work is nothing special for all he is supposed to do in this film is to show up at a particular moment & then disappear once again. However, Crahan Denton does justice to his white trash character.On an overall scale, To Kill A Mockingbird shouldn't even be classified as courtroom drama when it is something else entirely. Its #1 ranking in the AFI Top !0 Courtroom Dramas is the very reason why I was intrigued to check it out in the first place but to find that part in such a small dose & the story being more inclined towards those kids than the case at hand was both disappointing & frustrating.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"9 September 2013","score":"","review":" Widely considered by many to be one of the finest films ever made, this so-called Greatest courtroom drama of all time has only one segment set in the courthouse while the rest of it concerns a couple of annoying kids & their everyday life, which doesn't even have anything to do with the case. In addition to that, it's an insufferably boring film to sit through!Based on the novel of the same name, the story of To Kill A Mockingbird is set in a fictional American town during the 1930s and concerns a respected lawyer & his family who faces a backlash from his society when he agrees to defend a young black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Through the trial, the racial attitude in town's society is exposed.Directed by Robert Mulligan, it is surprising that the first half of the film doesn't even feature anything related to the case, which itself surfaces very late into the story. Maybe this movie isn't a courtroom drama after all, maybe it's more about the loss of childhood innocence & stuff like that but that's not what I was looking forward to after having heard so much praise about it.Set pieces do carry an authentic feel of its timeline & location.

I personally haven't really warmed up to French Cinema. I will say out of all the cinemas I have seen, French is the one I can't really seem to get into. With that being said I did find this movie to be good.The plot of this movie is that a young French girl decides to interfere in other people's lives for the better (or so she thinks) and falls in love in the process.Now here are the things I find wrong with it. Basically it's the things Amelie does to interfere in other people's lives. The scenes at the beginning where she finds remnants of someone's childhood and gives it to him, now middleaged. That was good. But later on in the film she basically tries to set up two people to fall in love. Not because she finds them perfect for each other or anything like that. But because of her overhearing someone talk about the recipe for love.I only have one other complaint with the movie. It has the tendency to toss information at you that isn't needed for the story and never will be mentioned again. For example, Do we really need to know that a cat likes listening to children's stories? I know it was played on as a joke but, come on.With that being said I did find the humour in this movie, while bizarre it actually works (but I'm sure that's what most people think when looking at a new humour). I mean, some of the jokes are really out there, such as a suicidal goldfish (well I'm giving this movie credit for being original) and Amelie playing practical jokes on the guy that owns the fruit shop.So would I recommend this movie? If you are a fan of French cinema (of which I still think I need to find one that is really entertaining) then sure, this is worth a look. If you're looking for an introduction then this isn't bad.

It gives the perception of being normal at first glance. But, as the film proceeds, we realize she isn't normal. She will go to any lengths to proceed with her disillusionment as much as possible, she wants her glory days back, not realizing she never will.

Quite possibly the best around. We really get into the psychology of Gloria Swanson's character and her performance does an unbelievable job of portraying it. Right from the start, we can tell something is off. She is clearly obsessed with herself but at first, it just seems like a typical stuck-up film star who only cares about herself. It gives the perception of being normal at first glance. But, as the film proceeds, we realize she isn't normal. She will go to any lengths to proceed with her disillusionment as much as possible, she wants her glory days back, not realizing she never will. Max (Erich von Stroheim) is Norma Desmond's butler and only helps with her disillusionment. He keeps it up and allows it to happen. We don't know why until towards the end, but it makes sense as it reaches the point. Joe Gillis stays with Norma to fix a script she wrote. He knows it's horrible, but he has a comfortable place to stay and basically infinite amounts of money. He's satisfied. We don't really get extremely in depth with his character, but I'm okay with that. It needed to stay focused on Norma as it did. The movie is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder, as he usually does. John F. Seitz provides the film's cinematography that gives it the distinct film noir look. I don't have a whole lot more to say about this film but it truly is a masterpiece filled with multiple haunting and memorable moments.

With Christian Bales performance of the caped crusader still fresh in everyones minds, many are unwilling to give Affleck the chance to prove himself. It was at this point that I decided to revisit several of his different roles from throughout his career in an attempt to come to a conclusion. The first of these films being the touching 'Good Will Hunting', co- written and starring both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.When a series of difficult equations are solved by a university janitor, he is pursued by a professor after he is arrested following a street fight. Help comes from mysterious places as he is released on the grounds that he meets regularly with both a Therapist and the Professor in an attempt to help him realise his full potential.He goes through several therapists in quick succession as he outsmarts and analyses them prior to them being able to properly get to know him. This calls for Professor Gerard Lambeauto call upon his old college friend, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Both characters grew up in South Boston, which helps them to develop a connection that will test their limits.Will (Matt Damon) soon understands that he has met his intellectual equal and their meetings play out much like a game of chess. It's thrilling to watch them both trying to gain the upper hand only to constantly counter each other. Williams is such an accomplished actor, always perfecting the role of the caring teacher as Hunting desperately searches for a father figure after having a turbulent childhood. Realising this, Maguire opens up to share real life experience as the genius has limited himself so much, knowing only what he knows from literature and quotations to protect himself from the pain of losing people.All the characters have believable motivations for helping Will and it's good to see how they all approach it in different way. From the assertive, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård) who attempts to push the genius down various career paths to Sean, who tries to guide him to find his own path, understanding that Wills difficulties originate from the abuse and neglect that he experienced in his childhood.Although Affleck isn't in the lime-light throughout most of the movie there are several key scenes which really triumph in leaving a lasting impression on the viewer. With honourable mentions to his final, poignant scene. On the other hand, collaborating with Damon to create such an incredible script is a testament to their skill. Far from being a skeptic, this has really made me far more open to his take on the worlds greatest detective.The movie really tackles many issues as you see the darkness that some talented people can face on a daily basis and how his past overshadows his brilliance, preventing him from taking leaps towards a better life. It really is a film based on self discovery and the events that rekindle his intentions to push himself further in his existence begin as he comprehends how many people care for him. I'd recommend this film to anyone as it can really resonate with any viewer.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"9 September 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The movie industry has always had an obscure relationship with drugs. Originally being completely taboo, they are now a staple in many modern horrors and comedies. Where some films glamourise them such as the 'Stoner-Comedy' sub-genre, there are other films that really show the grittier, downward spiral that narcotics can easily take people down such as 'Less Than Zero' or 'Spun'.Having seen Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem for a Dream' before, I knew what film I was going to be sitting through. There would be no settling down, and no entertainment. This isn't to say that it is not a great film but you really do feel emotionally drained after the viewing. It isn't a movie you watch prior to settling down to sleep but one that will haunt you for a time after the credits have rolled. The surreal parts emphasise occurrences superbly, going from a very limited dark colour palette in reality to vibrant, energetic colours in their hallucinogenic, vegetated state that enables you to see things from their perspective without making drugs seem alluring. Far from it. This is potentially one of the greats of anti-drug cinema.There is no way to really prepare yourself for such an experience. It is bleak straight from the opening scenes where Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is introduced. Entering his own mother, Sara's (Ellen Burstyn) home, he takes her television to acquire money for a fix. All the while the cinematography really gives you a deeper insight into their tarnished relationship as there is a literal line drawn between the two characters, showing their actions and reactions.Harry plans on becoming a dealer of high quality drugs with Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) whilst Goldfarb slowly drags his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connely) into the fire with him, promising her their dirty money would go towards her own store where she can sell her fashion designs but, with her history of drug-usage. She soon finds herself back in a predicament.The film takes place over three seasons; Summer, Autumn and Winter and each play out as an act, showing the escalating desperation as the four main individuals sink deeper into their troubles. Throughout Harry's ordeal with the heroin his mother is dealing with another form of addiction. After the loss of her husband she has become lonely and food and television have become her substitute for love. After a phone-call from a television station she is filled with false hope, entertaining the idea of her 15 minutes of fame. Determined to wear her once beloved red dress for her small-screen appearance, unknowingly, she turns to amphetamine and becomes increasingly reliant on it's effects.Much like seasons in reality, each act becomes darker earlier, cold in it's outlook. Frosty in it's reception. Each of the characters push past the point of no return, sacrificing love, health and happiness in their own selfish or vulnerable haze.It isn't just the acting or the content of the movie that pushes it above and beyond, it's the orchestral pieces by Clint Mansell that really capture the despair. I am unable to listen to his pieces, full of sorrow and foreboding. It has a confounding effect on the soul emphasising all that is occurring on screen. Without a doubt it is one of the most effective and provocative soundtracks I have experienced on film. As much as it is an essential watch. It's too taxing to watch regularly. However, it deserves pride of place in any DVD collection and I would implore everyone to give it at least one viewing in their life-time. A powerful and eye-opening view into an underworld that most people avoid in their life-times. It really is a challenging view.

The surreal parts emphasise occurrences superbly, going from a very limited dark colour palette in reality to vibrant, energetic colours in their hallucinogenic, vegetated state that enables you to see things from their perspective without making drugs seem alluring. Far from it. This is potentially one of the greats of anti-drug cinema.There is no way to really prepare yourself for such an experience. It is bleak straight from the opening scenes where Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is introduced. Entering his own mother, Sara's (Ellen Burstyn) home, he takes her television to acquire money for a fix. All the while the cinematography really gives you a deeper insight into their tarnished relationship as there is a literal line drawn between the two characters, showing their actions and reactions.Harry plans on becoming a dealer of high quality drugs with Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) whilst Goldfarb slowly drags his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connely) into the fire with him, promising her their dirty money would go towards her own store where she can sell her fashion designs but, with her history of drug-usage. She soon finds herself back in a predicament.The film takes place over three seasons; Summer, Autumn and Winter and each play out as an act, showing the escalating desperation as the four main individuals sink deeper into their troubles. Throughout Harry's ordeal with the heroin his mother is dealing with another form of addiction. After the loss of her husband she has become lonely and food and television have become her substitute for love. After a phone-call from a television station she is filled with false hope, entertaining the idea of her 15 minutes of fame. Determined to wear her once beloved red dress for her small-screen appearance, unknowingly, she turns to amphetamine and becomes increasingly reliant on it's effects.Much like seasons in reality, each act becomes darker earlier, cold in it's outlook. Frosty in it's reception. Each of the characters push past the point of no return, sacrificing love, health and happiness in their own selfish or vulnerable haze.It isn't just the acting or the content of the movie that pushes it above and beyond, it's the orchestral pieces by Clint Mansell that really capture the despair. I am unable to listen to his pieces, full of sorrow and foreboding. It has a confounding effect on the soul emphasising all that is occurring on screen. Without a doubt it is one of the most effective and provocative soundtracks I have experienced on film. As much as it is an essential watch. It's too taxing to watch regularly. However, it deserves pride of place in any DVD collection and I would implore everyone to give it at least one viewing in their life-time. A powerful and eye-opening view into an underworld that most people avoid in their life-times. It really is a challenging view.

Originally being completely taboo, they are now a staple in many modern horrors and comedies. Where some films glamourise them such as the 'Stoner-Comedy' sub-genre, there are other films that really show the grittier, downward spiral that narcotics can easily take people down such as 'Less Than Zero' or 'Spun'.Having seen Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem for a Dream' before, I knew what film I was going to be sitting through.
