In fact, I used to watch this film for more than 20 times ( I got the DVD ) when I was in college, and I think it is one of the best film I even seem in these years.I actually can understand why most people don't like the film. I guess it is because this film digs up the underground world that related to the Underground Porns Well, as you can understand, most people just can't accept the topic, and thus don't like the people, movies, and books that talk about it ( Well, people like ignoring things that they don't like but actually exist. How stupid is that? )Anyway, 8mm sure is a powerful and underrated movie. Its' story, script, casting, and the characters' acting are all wonderful. The first half of the movie may seem a little slow, but the second half is very breath taking, especially when Max gets killed, and Tom (Cage) tries to run away ( I still remember when I watched this part the first time with my girlfriend, I fast forwared so that I could find out can he really escape before I went on with the film, and got my ass kicked by my girlfriend...... ). Also, the guy who plays as Max in the movie has the best performance, and lines in the film. I will give 8.5 stars out of 10 for this film. However, this is a film that only for those people who have an open mind, and willing to see the dark side of our world.P.S.  See the comments on this film from the users int32, and Fat-Boy99.

The Greek style performers are fantastic and not at all out of place. The director put it there, and when an old proven talent does something like that, it's up to you to understand it. It isn't up to him to direct down to your level. The movie doesn't meet standards of movie normalcy, and that will probably confuse and annoy those who aren't up to using their brains extensively while they enjoy a film.Woody Allen has become more challenging to watch as he matures, but as I get older and more observant I can find and enjoy more of the subtleties. When it seems like it's getting slow that just means he's setting you up for something grand. Mira Sorvino is good. Decent. But she isn't all that. She's great to look at.

This, an animated feature film spin-off of the immensely popular cult television show from Comedy Central, is one of the most deliberately profane, vulgar and controversial films I have ever seen &#150; and, like many controversial films, it is a social satire with bite.That's not to say that it's flawless. The movie is funny, and it has its fair share of hilarious moments, but it isn't great by any means &#150; and often goes searching for laughs in all the wrong places. Still, one has to admire the guts of Parker and Stone &#150; who also voice most of the characters in the movie. I never thought I'd see so many racial stereotypes packed into a single movie &#150; much less an animated one. I never thought I'd see young (albeit animated) children using four-letter words with such pride. I never thought I'd see Saddam Hussein and Satan having a homosexual affair together. Then again, I never thought I'd really see anything remotely close to the content in general that exists within 'South Park' the movie.Fans of the TV show will already be familiar with the characters four animated kids named Kenny, Kyle, Stan and Cartman. 'Uncut' opens with a cheery musical number and rapidly moves towards vulgarity as the 'innocent' children sneak into an R-rated movie starring their boyhood idols, the foul-mouthed Canadian duo Terrence and Philip, whose combined humor consists of bodily function gags and songs with extreme profanity. ('What did he say?' one of the boys mutters in the theater after the first expletive is heard.)Terrence and Philip's movie becomes number one at the box office, inspiring many local children to start frequently swearing. The parents of South Park decide to launch a campaign named Mothers Against Canada (MAC), with the sole intent of starting a war between the U.S. and our neighbors to the north.If Terrence and Philip are killed, Satan and a recently deceased Saddam Hussein (the character of which is actually represented by real photos of Hussein blended with animation) will rise from the bowels of Hell and take over the world. Terrence and Philip's death somehow &#150; for one reason or another &#150; signifies the coming of the apocalypse, and Kenny &#150; who dies early on in the film, goes to Hell and realizes Satan's plan &#150; rises back to Earth as a ghostly image and tells his friends they must stop the war.I think Trey Parker and Matt Stone are making a statement here, not just about war in general but also about what they believe is 'censorship' by the MPAA and their absurd standards (as one character sings in a musical number, it's okay to show nasty blood and guts &#150; but just don't say any naughty words!). And it's quite obvious that 'Terrence and Philip' are metaphors for the creators of 'South Park,' and the reaction of the public in the film is an eerie foreshadowing of the controversy surrounding the 'real' film's release. It's a clever bit of self-parody that works quite well. I don't think anyone can say that 'South Park' is dumb, even if it's immature.Canadians in 'South Park' are represented by crude stick figures with heads that part at the mouth into two pieces, flapping about as they 'talk.' The animation on the Americans isn't much better &#150; very, very basic drawings. In a bit of a self-referential stab, one of the kids in the film says that he likes Terrence & Philip, but 'the animation sucks.'Some people said 'The Passion of the Christ' was anti-Semitic. Some people said 'Birth of a Nation' was racist (indeed, a recent limited re-release was protested). 'South Park' is both. Packaged along with more than a handful of scatological references are cruel jokes surrounding ethnicity. There are running gags about Jewish residents of South Park, as well as African-Americans and, of course, Canadians. However juvenile their jokes may be, however, Parker and Stone manage to make us laugh &#150; even though we may sometimes feel disturbed by doing so. And one can't help but realize that a lot of the racial jokes are satirical &#150; such as when the Army decides to launch an attack against Canada, and a platoon of black soldiers are used as the 'human shield.' The movie is often trying to say something important, which isn't at all what I had expected &#150; and the notion of America trying to blame other countries for its fault (in this case, Canada) isn't so far-fetched.'South Park' contains less profanity than 'Scarface,' 'Pulp Fiction,' 'GoodFellas,' and 'American History X,' among others, but it's known for its strong language. It constantly pops up on Internet message boards as one of 'the' most profane films of all time, despite the fact that according to official sources it contains less than half the amount of foul language found in Martin Scorsese's 'Casino.'So why are so many people convinced that it has the most profane language of all-time? Well, part of the reason is its length &#150; barely more than 80 minutes &#150; and I'm sure another large issue is the fact that it's animated, and all the profanity is delivered at a rapid speed, mostly by supposed 'children' (who look like big blobs of cardboard). And, unlike more serious films, the profanity in 'South Park' is there for no reason at all &#150; at least not in the same context as dramas. In an interview, director Trey Parker claimed that the intent of 'South Park Bigger, Longer & Uncut' was to shock. And indeed, if that was his point then he and co-writer Stone have succeeded &#150; this is a revolutionary advancement in mainstream entertainment. The MPAA is constantly stretching its boundaries, and with 'South Park' &#150; which they originally gave an NC-17 classification prior to certain scenes being deleted by Parker &#150; they really have shamed themselves.I liked 'South Park,' a number of scenes made me laugh and I was very amused overall. No fault can be found in its short length, either &#150; had it dragged out another twenty minutes, perhaps it would have seemed too long, but its current runtime is appropriate given the material. Not all the jokes work, and sometimes the film just goes too far &#150; but if you're looking for something funny, and you have an open mind and aren't easily offended, 'South Park Bigger, Longer & Uncut' is a worthy recommendation.

","genre":"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"11 September 2004","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  'South Park' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have been major protesters against the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) since one of their early films, 'Orgazmo,' was tagged with an NC-17 rating due to strong language and pervasive sexual content.They have been known to purposely upset the MPAA by a number of methods, but nothing they've done yet reaches the low standards of 'South Park Bigger, Longer & Uncut' (1999). This, an animated feature film spin-off of the immensely popular cult television show from Comedy Central, is one of the most deliberately profane, vulgar and controversial films I have ever seen &#150; and, like many controversial films, it is a social satire with bite.That's not to say that it's flawless. The movie is funny, and it has its fair share of hilarious moments, but it isn't great by any means &#150; and often goes searching for laughs in all the wrong places. Still, one has to admire the guts of Parker and Stone &#150; who also voice most of the characters in the movie. I never thought I'd see so many racial stereotypes packed into a single movie &#150; much less an animated one. I never thought I'd see young (albeit animated) children using four-letter words with such pride. I never thought I'd see Saddam Hussein and Satan having a homosexual affair together. Then again, I never thought I'd really see anything remotely close to the content in general that exists within 'South Park' the movie.Fans of the TV show will already be familiar with the characters four animated kids named Kenny, Kyle, Stan and Cartman. 'Uncut' opens with a cheery musical number and rapidly moves towards vulgarity as the 'innocent' children sneak into an R-rated movie starring their boyhood idols, the foul-mouthed Canadian duo Terrence and Philip, whose combined humor consists of bodily function gags and songs with extreme profanity. ('What did he say?' one of the boys mutters in the theater after the first expletive is heard.)Terrence and Philip's movie becomes number one at the box office, inspiring many local children to start frequently swearing. The parents of South Park decide to launch a campaign named Mothers Against Canada (MAC), with the sole intent of starting a war between the U.S. and our neighbors to the north.If Terrence and Philip are killed, Satan and a recently deceased Saddam Hussein (the character of which is actually represented by real photos of Hussein blended with animation) will rise from the bowels of Hell and take over the world. Terrence and Philip's death somehow &#150; for one reason or another &#150; signifies the coming of the apocalypse, and Kenny &#150; who dies early on in the film, goes to Hell and realizes Satan's plan &#150; rises back to Earth as a ghostly image and tells his friends they must stop the war.I think Trey Parker and Matt Stone are making a statement here, not just about war in general but also about what they believe is 'censorship' by the MPAA and their absurd standards (as one character sings in a musical number, it's okay to show nasty blood and guts &#150; but just don't say any naughty words!). And it's quite obvious that 'Terrence and Philip' are metaphors for the creators of 'South Park,' and the reaction of the public in the film is an eerie foreshadowing of the controversy surrounding the 'real' film's release. It's a clever bit of self-parody that works quite well. I don't think anyone can say that 'South Park' is dumb, even if it's immature.Canadians in 'South Park' are represented by crude stick figures with heads that part at the mouth into two pieces, flapping about as they 'talk.' The animation on the Americans isn't much better &#150; very, very basic drawings. In a bit of a self-referential stab, one of the kids in the film says that he likes Terrence & Philip, but 'the animation sucks.'Some people said 'The Passion of the Christ' was anti-Semitic. Some people said 'Birth of a Nation' was racist (indeed, a recent limited re-release was protested). 'South Park' is both. Packaged along with more than a handful of scatological references are cruel jokes surrounding ethnicity. There are running gags about Jewish residents of South Park, as well as African-Americans and, of course, Canadians. However juvenile their jokes may be, however, Parker and Stone manage to make us laugh &#150; even though we may sometimes feel disturbed by doing so. And one can't help but realize that a lot of the racial jokes are satirical &#150; such as when the Army decides to launch an attack against Canada, and a platoon of black soldiers are used as the 'human shield.' The movie is often trying to say something important, which isn't at all what I had expected &#150; and the notion of America trying to blame other countries for its fault (in this case, Canada) isn't so far-fetched.'South Park' contains less profanity than 'Scarface,' 'Pulp Fiction,' 'GoodFellas,' and 'American History X,' among others, but it's known for its strong language. It constantly pops up on Internet message boards as one of 'the' most profane films of all time, despite the fact that according to official sources it contains less than half the amount of foul language found in Martin Scorsese's 'Casino.'So why are so many people convinced that it has the most profane language of all-time?

But, it is only in recent times that the Steinbeck wonderment is brought into the film industries' lime light to be produced as nothing less than a masterpiece anecdote of two traveler's dreams, relationships, and passions. The transformation between book and film has been portrayed close to perfection, with few flaws, and resulting in great viewer satisfaction.'Of Mice and Men' is an originally unique tale concentrating on the hardships of men in the 1930's, with a collage of death, fate, and companionship coed together with a few laughs, and a few cries; this film is a remarkable feat of movie making. The focus of both the book and film is centered around two nomadic travelers, George and Lennie &#150; both of which are uniquely different, with a few commonalties. The most important of these is their shared dream of one-day owning a small plot of land that they can call their own, with a few rabbits, farm-animals, and where no-one may order them about, nor tell them what to do. This dream is modest, yet desperately desired by both men, and they will endure almost anything to get it. George, a clever man played by director Garry Sinise, is the 'leader' of the two men, the one who calls all the shots, and keeping the mentally handicapped Lennie in line; Lennie, acted magnificently by John Malkovich, inarticulately follows George's orders, and instructions to keep out of his own trouble. The loyalty between the two is priceless, and, although frequently strained, they stick together through the harder of hardships &#150; both having each other to rely on. Recently forced into hastily leaving their jobs due to one of Lennie's common but unfortunate misunderstandings; they find themselves on a ranch in California's Salinas Valley, working hard as 'Barley Buckers' for their monthly payment &#150; and ever saving for their dream acreage.The story slowly unfolds as they meld with other solitary travelers at the ranch. Like themselves, they're are others on the road with colourful dreams perpetually present in their own minds. One such fellow traveler is Candy (Ray Walston), the 'ranch elder'. Candy has his eye on George & Lennie's plan, and decides to team up with the duo to buy the land quicker than expected. Everything seems to be happily falling into place, until they meet 'Curly's Wife' (we never hear her actual name). She is a promiscuous, licentious and cunning woman. Curly, the ranch owner's over-protective son is recently married, and intensely paranoid, and out to catch anyone who even so much as looks at his wife. In the end this causes problems of great magnitude for Lennie, as he dim-wittily is drawn in by this girl to inevitably meet his fate. The movie is bursting with exciting twists and turns, with exceptional acting by all characters. Running smoothly from beginning to end, with no 'abrupt ending' &#150; common in many films adapted from books. Although feeling a little disappointed about Lennie's physical size &#150; being described much larger in the novel than in the film, the extremely difficult character was acted out fantastically by John Malkovich, a proclaimed French actor in his own right. He worked the difficult slurs of the character's makeup perfectly, with great involvement and effort he brought 'Lennie' off the pages of the novel to real life.This film shows the true side of people, their dreams and hopes, all wonderfully presented in an enjoyable and challenging fashion. I give it an 8\/10. It is a truly lovely rendition of one of America's best pieces of literature.

Recently forced into hastily leaving their jobs due to one of Lennie's common but unfortunate misunderstandings; they find themselves on a ranch in California's Salinas Valley, working hard as 'Barley Buckers' for their monthly payment &#150; and ever saving for their dream acreage.The story slowly unfolds as they meld with other solitary travelers at the ranch. Like themselves, they're are others on the road with colourful dreams perpetually present in their own minds. One such fellow traveler is Candy (Ray Walston), the 'ranch elder'. Candy has his eye on George & Lennie's plan, and decides to team up with the duo to buy the land quicker than expected. Everything seems to be happily falling into place, until they meet 'Curly's Wife' (we never hear her actual name). She is a promiscuous, licentious and cunning woman. Curly, the ranch owner's over-protective son is recently married, and intensely paranoid, and out to catch anyone who even so much as looks at his wife. In the end this causes problems of great magnitude for Lennie, as he dim-wittily is drawn in by this girl to inevitably meet his fate. The movie is bursting with exciting twists and turns, with exceptional acting by all characters. Running smoothly from beginning to end, with no 'abrupt ending' &#150; common in many films adapted from books. Although feeling a little disappointed about Lennie's physical size &#150; being described much larger in the novel than in the film, the extremely difficult character was acted out fantastically by John Malkovich, a proclaimed French actor in his own right. He worked the difficult slurs of the character's makeup perfectly, with great involvement and effort he brought 'Lennie' off the pages of the novel to real life.This film shows the true side of people, their dreams and hopes, all wonderfully presented in an enjoyable and challenging fashion. I give it an 8\/10. It is a truly lovely rendition of one of America's best pieces of literature. As Widgett Walls said Nothing like a couple of acting gods attacking one of the classics.© Peter Brien 2004  ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"11 September 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  It has been a long while since John Steinbeck sat down to write the world-renowned classic novelette 'Of Mice and Men'. For as long as anyone can remember this story has been loved and adored by people from all over the globe, all of which have been captured by the pure talent and illustrative writings that the story contains. But, it is only in recent times that the Steinbeck wonderment is brought into the film industries' lime light to be produced as nothing less than a masterpiece anecdote of two traveler's dreams, relationships, and passions. The transformation between book and film has been portrayed close to perfection, with few flaws, and resulting in great viewer satisfaction.'Of Mice and Men' is an originally unique tale concentrating on the hardships of men in the 1930's, with a collage of death, fate, and companionship coed together with a few laughs, and a few cries; this film is a remarkable feat of movie making. The focus of both the book and film is centered around two nomadic travelers, George and Lennie &#150; both of which are uniquely different, with a few commonalties. The most important of these is their shared dream of one-day owning a small plot of land that they can call their own, with a few rabbits, farm-animals, and where no-one may order them about, nor tell them what to do. This dream is modest, yet desperately desired by both men, and they will endure almost anything to get it. George, a clever man played by director Garry Sinise, is the 'leader' of the two men, the one who calls all the shots, and keeping the mentally handicapped Lennie in line; Lennie, acted magnificently by John Malkovich, inarticulately follows George's orders, and instructions to keep out of his own trouble.

I consider all the Friday the 13th sequels to be guilty pleasures (except that dreadful fifth installment) and I don't really support all the people who criticize them. The Friday series never were intellectual cinema experiences and it probably doesn't take you 8 film to find that out. So I see no use in bashing these film and if you hate them, just skip them. All of Jason adventures are amusing money-makers, intended for the fans. And this 'Jason takes Manhattan' perfectly fits in this slasher-structure. This film should better been entitled 'Jason takes a boat ride', as more than half of the film takes place on a cruise ship on its way from Crystal Lake to New York city. And, when arrived in New York, Jason doesn't get much further than the docks and the rancid slums. A group of high-school graduates are on their way to Manhattan for a city-trip and Jason cheerfully joins them as a stowaway. Our hockey-masked friend wanders around the boat and violently terminates everyone he comes across. The best characteristic about Jason is that he's the least discriminating killer ever! Whether a NY purse-snatcher or a young steersman who just informed us about his 19-months-old son&#133;.Jason Vorhees annihilates them all! Talking in terms of plotting, part VIII is weaker than the previous installment (The New Blood) that desperately tried to bring some creativity into the routine franchise. This film connects to the original by the main-heroine, who suffers from visions of young Jason pulling her down in Crystal Lake. But&#133;don't worry too much about the plot as the killings offer more than enough amusement and horror-fun. Favorite sequence definitely is when Jason takes about hundred hits from an amateur-boxer and then simply beheads his attacker with one clean smash! Go Jason, go!

Brad Pitt doesn't take himself too seriously and it's refreshing. Julia Roberts takes on the role of a whiny nagging girlfriend and ... it's refreshing, too. Sam truly irritated me; Roberts usually plays likable women, even if they're strident like Erin Brokovich. The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was a rip-off. However, the second time I saw it, I realized that if you disregarded the starpowers (Pitt and Roberts) and the misleading teasers (romance???), you've got a good story.I thought the story of the Mexican, la pistola, shot in sepia tones with tongue-in-cheek overacting, was hilarious. Some of the lines of the monologue were unintentionally funny, like that bit about the pistol not having a good aim.Also, the movie had too many twists and turns that towards the end, I just wanted for it to end.Ultimately, the script might have been the best thing about The Mexican.
