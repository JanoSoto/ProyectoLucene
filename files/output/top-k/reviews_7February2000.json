From the UK, it is about a young crowd of flatmates and their various relationship dilemmas. Much of the humour is centred around a new-agey men's self-help group where they pass around various implements like the 'rock of truth'.  They also go on a 'hunter gatherer' weekend with hilarious results. Trust me, you'll laugh your teeth out.
