I am surprised that of all the movies I have seen that this is one I have found to be unforgettable. Though the budget wasn't huge and the special effects look low-grade by today's standards the acting is good and the message is powerful. It resonated with me on a number of levels. It is also a very interesting story. It doesn't matter whether you believe in the supernatural or psychic abilities or any of that, it is still intriguing. After someone very close to me passed away the movie became even more significant to me. I could really relate to his confusion and the feelings of madness, the anger and questioning of your own sanity. If you are dealing with a tragic loss or asking big questions about life, death and the after-life, this movie might give you something new to ponder, or distract you for a while - in a useful way - from your private pain and grief.

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Mystery"},{"date":"25 February 2013","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" This is the film that Woody Allen notoriously shot and then scrapped, re-wrote, re-cast and re-shot, and was reportedly keen to do it a third time. But to be honest, I really wish he'd just left it scrapped. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Allen fan, and would sit down to watch anything by him, comedy or drama, and on top of that, I'm also a fan of Ingmar Bergman, whom Allen admires greatly and has obviously taken huge inspiration from for September, most notably his film Autumn Sonata. I also have great respect for Woody's constant desire to do his own thing, his desire to never get caught up in the demands of mainstream, money-making Hollywood, and his determination to always be different. But in this case, his desire to be different hinders September totally, and what could have been a thoughtful and original psychological drama ends up being a desperate attempt by Allen to be as bleak and different as possible, and is unnecessarily tedious and condescending.The story is simple. A group of six people, (in my opinion some of the most boring characters ever assembled), gather together one summer at a country house. From there on in, there is lifeless and at times pointless drama between the characters as they all deal with love and evaluating their lives, each one more annoying than the last, completely lacking any power or conviction.The concept of the film is fascinating, and suits a filmmaker like Allen, who focuses primarily on characters and their thoughts and feelings above all else, particularly in his dramas, down to the ground. The film is a chamber piece, that is, it focuses on a very small number of characters in the one setting from start to finish. Also, Allen's main idea is to film in the style of a play as much as possible, using long, un-broken shots and keeping any unnecessary camera movements like close-ups to a minimum. The fusion of these two mediums is an extremely interesting idea, and is appropriate for the material. So far, so interesting. But unfortunately, that still leaves the rest of the film to look at.Pretension is the word of the day in September, and as interesting as its premise is, everything else about it feels forcedly unglamorous and so unnecessarily bland, almost as if Allen was curious as to just how independent and how anti-Hollywood he could make a film. But as great an idea as that sounds, there's a huge difference between making a film that's genuinely different and non-mainstream, and making a film that's just trying to be different for the sake of being different and rubbing it in the faces of mainstream films and film-watchers everywhere, and to me that's all September is. Nothing feels natural about this film, and it doesn't feel like it was made to be good, it just seems like Allen's attempt to be as different and as indie as possible, with no effort at actually making it good.What doesn't help is that an experienced and talented cast turn in drab and lifeless performances, though one of the main reasons for this is that they all find themselves stuck with boring, one-dimensional and frankly whiny characters that spend the entire film upset or sad about their lives, but lacking any real emotional depth or personality, instead just doing it because Allen wants the film to be as bleak and dramatic as possible. Taking the lead role, Mia Farrow as Lane begins as probably the most human of all the characters, and the one that seems most real, but by the end has become the most boring and whiny of them all, with a pretty lacklustre performance. Sam Waterston as Peter is diabolical, delivering a totally flat and ridiculously wooden performance, almost like an acting student performing in front of his peers for the first time. On a par with Waterston's awful performance is that of Dianne Wiest as Stephanie who is about as interesting and emotionally engaging as a doorknob, and whose story of her failing marriage is as short on depth and insightfulness as her head is of hair.Luckily there are a few worthwhile performances, notably Denholm Elliott who gives a very interesting and subtle performance as Howard, the man in love with Lane, who is one of the only characters with any real appeal or feeling in the whole film, but who unfortunately is barely used. Another god performance comes from Elaine Stritch as Lane's mother Diane, who although gives a convincing and at times genuinely emotionally engrossing performance, is also saddled with an uninteresting and unengaging character. Strong support comes also from Jack Warner as Lane's stepfather Lloyd, an enjoyable and interesting character with intelligent and intriguing insights into life.As regards the poor performances, it would be unfair to say that it's totally the actors' fault, as they were dealing with a director who was after nothing more than ponderous melodrama and banal story-telling, and although conceived an unusual and interesting idea, was incapable of avoiding pretentiousness and one-dimension. Woody Allen has been responsible for many intelligent, engaging and extremely moving films. Go and watch those instead, as this is not one of them.

I thought it meant that Kane never wanted to be adopted and wanted to have a simple life, instead of the rich and famous life. The movie was directed brilliantly. You could tell Orson Welles put his all into this movie. He also won an Oscar for Best Screenplay, but it should have won all the awards it was nominated for. The acting is also brilliant, especially since most of the actors in the movies were new to film. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested.

It moved the story forward at the right pace. Reno did probably his best acting. Besson and Reno also teamed up in Leon bringing out the same lonely character bent upon perfection of his art.

The film isn't perfect. The cooking breakfast scene, for example, is way overdone (no father is THAT inept). But, the film does pack a HUGE emotional wallop and it is bound to leave most viewers in tears--and not in a cloying and manipulative way. So, I'll err on the side of 10--especially since the film has some terrific performances.I won't review the film or what it's about, as there are already a ton of reviews and comments on IMDb about the film and the subject matter it brings up. Now this isn't to mean I don't love this aspect of the film--I adore how the film pushes for social change in regard to paternal custody. What I'd instead like to discuss is the acting. The film earned an Oscar for Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor) and Meryl Streep (Best Actress) and the boy (Justin Henry) earn a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Hoffman was great. He showed a wonderful range in his acting--much greater than usual for a guy in a film. As for Streep, every moment she was in the film she was excellent, though I was surprised she got the Oscar for Best Actress since she really wasn't in the film that much. But, the one that REALLY impressed me was Henry--who just blew me away with his natural acting and emotionality. The kid was simply amazing and so real--it's a shame the Academy really won't give the Oscar to kids (though they sure will nominate them).Overall, a wonderful film but one you MUST watch with some Kleenex nearby. It sure packs an emotional wallop.

On one hand, it is obviously a Schwarzenegger star vehicle, directed by the characteristically over-the-top Paul Verhoeven, a ludicrous gore-fest featuring no shortage of cheap thrills. On the other hand, it is a seriously conceptual science fiction trip, and however much it may depart from the Phillip K. Dick source material on which it is based, it still is a genuinely good, thoughtful story at its heart.It opens with a beautiful, mysterious scene on Mars, but soon finds itself back on Earth, with Arnold and his crazy reptilian facial expressions, going 21st-century schizoid man on any number of enemies that he finds coming out of the woodwork to get him. Along the way, there is a lot of (obviously fake) blood, a lot of people dying dramatically, a lot of product placement, and plenty of shameless exploitation of all sorts of things.But somehow, it never becomes disposable. From the word go, Schwarzenegger's title character is one worth caring about, and as the overall plot gradually reveals itself, one can easily become quite engrossed in it. This is not a film without real emotion. There is plenty of drama, a truly big, epic climax and a surprisingly artistic final frame.There are two specific elements in TOTAL RECALL that I think bear mentioning. First, the excellent visual depictions of the planet Mars. I am referring to the *exteriors* where, whatever the filmmaking techniques used, a very evocative picture is painted of another world, both romantic and bleak at the same time.The second thing is the performance of Rachel Ticotin. Her depiction of the character Melina makes this film far better and more watchable that it would have been otherwise. I cannot overstate that. I found myself looking her up to see what else she had acted in. In a film full of performances that are effective but most of them laughable nonetheless, Ticotin is really, seriously believable. For me, she is the heart. (Not Sharon Stone.)I do not know how much I actually like this film. But it is an undeniably entertaining watch, with some interesting ideas about the future and no lack of visual craziness. It is far more violent than I had anticipated, so definitely not for everyone. Also, it is a bit dated when viewed in the present (2013), but not nearly so much as many other films from its era.

It's pretty incredible to think that this film works as well as it does because there's really nothing that happens here. The two people walk around talking and every once in a while they sit down somewhere and talk. It took a lot of courage for a film like this but in the end it really pays off. Both Hawke and Delpy turn in some of the best work of their careers and without their chemistry there would be no film. Again, this thing shouldn't have worked for so many reasons but the two stars are so flawless that you can't help but believe the relationship as it blooms. I really liked the way both of them got to make complete characters who aren't alike but they still enjoy their time together.

The screenplay gives the two a lot of different stories to tell and while not all of them are interesting, even the less interesting ones still seem like a real conversation you'd have.

This movie sums up those fears in a nutshell.The Movie is about a bunch of kids who decide to fight a Guerrilla War against the invading communist forces that are oppressing the people of their hometown. At first, the basic storyline sounds incredibly stupid and far fetched (even by cold war standards) and it starred several actors who were either already well known or later became well known.The dialogue isn't too bad (except the first few lines prior to the invasion) with some very memorable sequences and quotes (WOLVERINES!!!), and the characters are all well done; the kids themselves are believable and show emotion quite well (especially compared to it's 2012 remake). Heck, even the Communist forces are given a fair amount of screen time, with one of the commanders having seconds thoughts about WW3 by the end, (Something which is non-existent in the remake).The Action sequences themselves are quite entertaining and well set, especially concerning that these kids have no prior experience in warfare.However, the one thing that impressed me about this movie was it's attention to detail All the tanks and firearms are correct (and if not, heavily modified to resemble the correct weapons\/vehicles). Heck, even the Soviet Propaganda in the town during it's occupation is very believable.The only flaws of this movie are the fact that some suspension of disbelief is required (How are the kids able to slaughter and entire Spetsnaz brigade, who are among the best trained special forces in the world?), and that it's obviously dated (Most kids don't know what Communism is let alone the Soviet Union) and a few minor pacing issues.Overall, I think this is a pretty good movie that you should check out if you are a fan of 1980's action movies, cold war movies, or even any sort of action movie for that matter.

The film is a simple, routine and straight forward drama driven by script and scenario which works better than most dramas do having had a gazillion-and-one things thrown at it. Set in one location for its entire duration, and I read drawing on influence from a stage show of similar ilk, Lifeboat is a never anything less than fascinating film feeding off this really effective sense of isolation and being stranded with different classes; genders and the enemy. It is a survival film, but a film wherein characters must use their wits and minds to work through situations; one wherein writers must use their own respective qualities in this department to further things along whilst running on a minimalist premise. When the on screen drama comes off, and the author is firing on all cylinders in the manner they are here with what they have their characters say; do and how they manipulate fate to up the ante, the results are quite extraordinary pieces of film-making. Lifeboat is one of these instances.The film covers an array of personnel aboard a lifeboat, the titular lifeboat; a small yet large enough vessel for all half a dozen or so people coming to terms with the fact their ship has been shelled by a German U-boat in the Atlantic and they are now stuck riding the waves of the open sea. We are in the middle of The Second World War and, in a cruel twist of fate, the U-boat itself is struck and sunk resulting in a lone German sailor clambering aboard and into the fray. This of course causes issues given the global situation, but adds an extra dimension to things via the problem with the language barrier.One might say the presence of these people together like this is representative of how people at the time came to find themselves stuck in a situation of global conflict as a whole. Different folk of British and American ilk, some female and some male; some white and one even African American &#x96; all of different classes and backgrounds, are here all together in the same boat (quite literally) at the bereft of a German attack no one saw coming and no one expected would interrupt their pleasant lives as they ploughed on. The presence of a German is intriguing in this sense, if beyond the fact it might act as a petty source for some form of antagonism in the future. Where cries of propaganda might arise, it is interesting to observe just how much more bloodthirsty certain American characters are in this film during this time of German induced mass-slaughter in Europe. Here, the German is not a beacon of evil or a mere stock villain; he is just as smart (if not smarter) than anyone else and is depicted as his own entity with a realistic set of goals for the scenario.The film is beautifully paced and wonderfully directed; taking this premise of a bunch of people trapped in a boat and wrenching out as much heightened tension and such as possible without ever becoming stuck or just feeling like it were plodding along. Concept drams such as these have worked well in the past, films one can pitch in a sentence or a single line; in 1994 film Speed's case, a character is even able to outline three quarters (or the part most people remember) of the plot through a line of dialogue one feels they might say in that situation anyway regarding bombs on buses and the figures behind such a situation. There is less of that sense of spectacle in Lifeboat, but that same sense of energy and drama. The film doesn't have the room for its characters that films such as Cellular did, its inhabitants are stuck where they stand, but if we desire cause and effect to drive the proceedings, the 'cause' must often from within the craft itself while the 'effect' must then go on to have such a thing on everyone in said craft.

I suppose to make this worth watching, she has to do a good job with this. The story itself has been done over and over seeking revenge after a violent crime because the justice system has failed. That's a pretty cliché type of situation and story, so there's not really a great deal to recommend this as far as originality is concerned. But Fields is good, and Kiefer Sutherland is appropriately creepy and threatening as the rapist\/murderer. The portrayal of the rape of Karen's daughter was terrifying, but (thankfully) not especially graphic.) The same could be said for the later rape committed by Sutherland's Doob. The movie, in my opinion, also makes a fair point about the justice system leaning too far on the side of defending the rights of obviously guilty criminals at the expense of actually dispensing justice for their victims. I understand the need to protect the rights of the accused, but there does have to be a balance, and that balance is sometimes lost in the system that we have.I was kind of put off by the group the McCann's attended for people who had lost loved ones to violence. To each his or her own, I suppose, but I can't imagine that sitting around night after night talking about the same thing over and over and over again is really going to help anyone move on, and I wasn't convinced by the vigilante organization aspect of this.I have to say, though, that I did like the ending. What I was finding distasteful up to this point was that Karen was going to turn vigilante, and by so doing she'd be be risking losing her other daughter as well by ending up in prison, which might have satisfied her own desire for revenge but would have been very selfish toward the younger daughter. So, the way she played things, she made sure that (a) she'd get her revenge, but (b) that she wouldn't lose anything more by doing it. So, the ending worked for me.

Since I was young, I never really got the name of the rabbit until I saw this masterpiece of a film and was blown all the way to the moon. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is not only a comical action packed suspense thriller, but a film which brings all our childhood fantasies to reality. Who didn't want to see Mickey Mouse interact with Bugs Bunny? Who didn't want to see Donald Duck throw Daffy Duck into a piano? Who didn't want to see Mary Poppins' penguins serving drinks in a nightclub? It's all stuff we imagined as youngsters, and this film brought it all together in a well paced, well put together, exciting, innovative, and most of all entertaining epic. It's undeniably one of my all time favorite animated films and one of my all time favorite films in general.I think what I love most about this movie is the way the human characters interact with the cartoon characters. The way Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) picks up Roger and tosses him in the sink, pretending to do his laundry, it's hilarious and impressive at the same time, and I still question how they were able to pull off such an effect. The way Jessica Rabbit dances around Marvin Acme, tugging on his cheeks and taking the hat off his head, it makes you think the cartoon characters are actually there and not inked animated creations superimposed over the film. I also like the scenes where the cartoons interact with human appliances. The scene where Roger is drinking, he's drinking from a real glass and he picks it up just like a flesh and blood human would. The scene where Roger is smashing plates over his head, he's smashing real plates and not animated cartoon ones. The scene where the Toon Patrol tracks down Eddie, they are wielding real guns and not cartoon ones. What's ironic is that the human Eddie would wield a cartoon gun later on in the film. This film has the perfect blend of slapstick, humor, drama, terror and straight forward fun, which makes sense for a film involving cartoon entities. I love some of the jokes seen throughout the motion picture and the puns spewed from the mouths of some of the characters really add a bit of comic relief, even in the film's most horrifying of scenes. I really love Charles Fleischer's voice work as Roger Rabbit, but would you believe Paul Pee-Wee Herman Reubens originally auditioned for the voice. Although Reubens would have done a great job, I really dig Fleischer's voicing of the character, especially his PWWWWLLLEEEAASSSEEE! You gotta love that, for it's the character's most distinctive trademark and makes him stick out among other rabbit characters in the world of the Toons. Bob Hoskins is also phenomenal as Eddie Valiant and to this day, it's considered one of his best roles, although I'll always remember him for playing Mario Mario.But the actor who steals the show in my eyes is Christopher Lloyd as the slinky yet intimidating Judge Doom. Straight out of Back to the Future, Lloyd delivers a menacing performance that has you laughing and screaming in fright all at once. You really feel frightened by this dude, and although he is defeated in the end, he sticks out in your mind and has his cartoonish red eyes watching you in your dreams. He's just that chilling. Although the human\/cartoon interaction and Lloyd are some of my favorite aspects of the film, my favorite moment of the film is the scene at the very end where the wall to Toon Town is broken and all our favorites come running out to get the spotlight. Literally, ALL our favorites are there. Mickey, Bugs, Betty Boop, Woody Woodpecker, Donald, Daffy, Goofy, Yosemite Sam, Pinocchio, Droopy Dog, even Peter from Disney's adaptation of Peter and the Wolf somehow squeezes in a cameo. My only gripe is that my all time favorite cat and mouse duo Tom and Jerry don't make an appearance, but that's just a miner nitpick.Overall, this is a perfect movie. This film clearly displays what films are made of or can be made of if a lot of hard work and ingenuity are put into them. This film clearly displays what fantasies and images of imagination are all about, and takes all the things we love about the Toons and blends them all together into one solid concoction. It also combines genres. One time it can be an action thriller, the other time it can be a romantic comedy, the other time it can be a horror film with Judge Doom drowning a Toon shoe in the horrid Dip. It puts together a lot of stuff we love about the movies and when you set your eyes upon this film, no matter how many times you set your eyes upon it, your inner child is released and in no time, you feel like your in another dimension filled with flying elephants and reluctant dragons. AND DON'T FORGET THE FLOWERS AND TREES. This is a solid picture that I've seen so many times, and I still can't believe how magnificent it is.
