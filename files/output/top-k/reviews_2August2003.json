I realise that it was one of the biggest movies in cinema history, but after initially 'liking it', I could see through its grandness and see that it had big faults. The consensus of the 'general public' was that the 'titanic' is a great movie, however I am one person who disagrees.One of the world's greatest tragedies, Titanic, the 'unsinkable' ship, a most unimaginable human catastrophe. The untold stories lay in mystery two and a half miles beneath the waves of the North Atlantic. Now, in a 'fictional romantic tale', Jack and Rose meet aboard the ill-fated 'Titanic', but their love gives them hope and courage as their trip aboard Titanic becomes a struggle just to survive.James Cameron certainly had big visions when he accepted the directing role on 'Titanic'. I believe Cameron wanted the 'Titanic' to appeal to a certain audience, perhaps young couples who have just fallen in love, I do not know. But what I do know is that having the love story in this film was unrealistic and boring for that matter. However, I did like how the film showed the events leading up too the ships demise, and the demise itself, as these had great drama and were what I was expecting from Cameron in the director's chair.But the biggest fault in this movie came from its story, which was also written by Cameron. Firstly, I did not like how the story started, having it being told from the point of view of a much older Rose (Gloria Stewart). Instead, I would have rather the story start with all the excitement of seeing the Titanic about to leave the doc. Then to write in a love story, such as the one presented here, was a typical Hollywood move, very corny, and for me, unappreciated. I agree with the people who say that the love story presented here is most disrespectful to the people who lost their lives on board the ship. But would have such a relationship ever have developed on board Titanic? I say 'NO!', because the very experience of being on the Titanic would have been very overpowering for many people. Then again, when the story starts to show the ship in crisis that is when I became 'interested' again, as that I what I wanted to be told via the story.I will admit that there was some pretty good acting talent on show in the 'Titanic'. Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is men that you could call plain lucky or unlucky, which ever way you look at his situation aboard the Titanic. Dawson is an artist, painting many different things. The only reason he is aboard the great ship, is because he won a hand of poker at the local saloon. He is now on the way to America. Little does he know what is about to unfold in his life. On the Titanic he casually glances at a beautiful woman, called Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). While DiCaprio and Winslet are great in their roles, I still find it hard to accept the love story the pair share, as I feel it was only ever there as a device to help sell the movie even more, however it did not work on me.There are other roles I enjoyed in Titanic. Rose's fiancé, Caledon 'Cal' Hockley (Billy Zane), was great as the mean and nasty 'bastard.  He believes he can buy what he does not have, and gives Rose a necklace called 'the heart of the ocean', a big focal point to the film. I love when Cal gets angry and aggressive towards other people on the ship, especially Jack. How he escapes from drowning in the cold ocean waters, was very clever indeed. The other character I liked here was Margaret 'Molly' Brown (Kathy Bates). She is tagged as being 'unseekable Molly Brown', with many of the 1st class passengers not liking her at all. Bate's humour was a real highlight for me, as was her help for Jack, and her compassion for the drowning passengers of the Titanic.I also enjoyed the special effects of Titanic, showing the ship, both functioning and in demise, especially the moment where the ship tears itself in half, and start to sink. The sets are also done in a grand way in this film, showing how classy an experience it must have been on the Titanic. The musicals score to Titanic is not bad, as it makes for great drama, tension and emotion. The main song of the soundtrack, 'My heart will go on', sung by Celine Dion, was a big song at the time of this movie's release. However when I hear it these days, I cringe at how bad it really is.Sure, the 'Titanic' is the highest grossing movie of all-time and winner of 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Director, but these facts do not change my opinion on how bad I think it is. I feel it is a movie that has suffered 'Hollywooditis', with just too much of the standard movie formula done here 'too sink a ship'. I would have preferred to see a much more low-key movie, focusing more on what it would like to be on such a ship as the 'Titanic', such as when Jack is at the front of the boat, screaming 'I'm the king of the world', as those sections of the movie had me captivated. I cannot say the same for its love story. Also, running at about 3 hours and 10 minutes, it was just a bit too long for my liking. I am amazed at how naïve the passengers were about the indestructibility of the Titanic, saying that it was 'unsinkable', because they were proven too be majorally wrong.CMRS gives 'Titanic' 1.5 (Bad - Ok Film)  ","genre":null},{"date":"2 August 2003","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  SPOILER ALERT The first time I watched this film it was a highly emotional experience, the second time, ironically, it bored me to 'tears'.

Famed action director John Woo has served himself well by mounting spectacularly effective and brilliantly orchestrated battle scenes, but the writers, John Rice and Joe Bateer, have let him down big time in the story department.  Woo has flooded the screen with moments of uncompromising graphic realism, only to have them mitigated by trite dialogue, predictable ironies and corny melodramatics.  Both the director and the men who actually lived through the events of this true-life story deserve better.`Windtalkers' does have history going for it.  In World War II, the Allied Forces in the Pacific needed to come up with a brand new code that would be `uncrackable' by the Japanese.  The military decided that it would base that code on the Navajo language, thus precipitating the need to recruit young Navajo men to come to the battlefields as `code-talkers.'  The film focuses on one such man, Ben Yahzee, and the officer, Joe Enders, whose sole duty it becomes to protect Ben in battle and keep him out of the hands of the Japanese.  Joe, naturally, balks at the idea of having to perform `babysitting' duty on the front line, and he is not afraid to show Ben just how he feels about the situation in the early stages of their relationship.  Joe has other problems as well.  Recently injured in battle himself, he also struggles with the guilt accrued from having led all the men of his previous platoon to their deaths while `following orders like a good Marine.'There is certainly plenty in terms of character and conflict for the screenwriters to work with here, yet somehow they never find a way to bring those characters or conflicts to convincing life.  Joe's initial reluctance to accept Ben is as predictable as his inevitable change of heart at the end.  And `predictable' is really the key word here in describing much of this film.  Are we really surprised when the most vocal racist in the group &#150; who says `Injuns' aren't much different from the Japanese they're all fighting &#150; has his life saved by the very man who's been the target of all his ridicule?  And don't we just know that a soldier will be gunned down the moment he offers a piece of chocolate to a distraught little Japanese girl?  Or how about the fact that the two men, one white, one Navajo, who have been literally making beautiful music together &#150; one on the flute and the other on the harmonica &#150; demonstrating colorblind brotherhood in action, are cut down right next to one another in the same battle?  Thus, the unsettling, cluttered `messiness' of the battle scenes is undercut by the too carefully contrived nature of so much of the actual narrative.  By trying so hard to move and uplift us, the film feels manipulative and calculated when it needs to feel most sincere.`Windtalkers' might have been a more compelling film were it not for the lackluster, wooden performance Nicholas Cage delivers in the lead role.  Cage has never been very adept at conveying complex emotions and his inability to provide any depth or shading to the psychologically tormented Enders goes a long way towards minimalizing the film's impact.  Adam Beach, on the other hand, brings a fresh-faced likability to the part of Ben, the Navajo, who, in many ways, takes on the Private Ryan role in the story.

The film is one of the BEST FILMS of my lifetime.  It will always represent to me, the dream that is America.I think it's because the emotions of the film are so universal, that I count it as one of my favorites. I am male, I am hispanic, I came to the United States when I was 13 years old.  I felt alienated, lonely and hopeless, could anyone really understand all that I wanted to do, all that I wanted to become.  How do you reconcile your cultural roots, with wanting to fit into the American Dream.I try to watch The JOY LUCK CLUB as often as I try to read the book.  Because it reminds me that we are all connected in so many ways.

He used to be a minister you know,' and visualizing a cross-Atlantic sea voyage by showing a cartoon ship moving jerkily across a cheesy map of the western hemisphere, now draw affectionate laughter.  But as sophisticated as we've all become, we're still able to enjoy The Lost World because we haven't lost our sense of wonder, which this film plays directly to.  This film has all the elements of a grand adventure, even if we are no longer able to accept it as such.  There are still several touches that can move us, such as the antics of Jocko, the superbly trained monkey who plays the intrepid explorers' animal companion, and the facial expressions of the stop-motion dinosaurs, which often reminded me of the snarls of my own cocker spaniel. Even the Brontosaurus run amok on the streets of Victorian London was so detailed it put me in mind of the ferret my wife and I have been pet sitting for the last week.  Actually, I'm not sure which of them causes more chaos when he gets loose.  Though many things in this flick seem ridiculous by today's standards, including wrestler Bull Montana dressed in a very bad monkey suit as the sinister scheming Ape Man, more often than not they just add to the fun.  For instance, apparently to lend verisimilitude, a real chimpanzee plays the Ape Man's companion.  Now you and I both know that the chimpanzee is an Old World Ape and not native to South America.  But we also know that pterodactyls and triceratops don't live in Brazil, either, so why sweat the chimp?This movie was a huge hit and absolutely state-of-the-art when it was released in 1925 and while much of it no longer works, a great deal of it does.Footnote I saw The Lost World on August 1st, 2003, 78 years after its first release.  It was shown as part of the Silent Film Society of Chicago's Silent Summer Film Festival.  There was live musical accompaniment provided by Dennis James on the Gateway Theatre's Mighty Pipe Organ, and the 28 piece Lincolnwood Chamber Orchestra, directed by Philip Simmons.  The Gateway Theatre hasn't been operated as a movie theater on a regular basis since I was a kid.  I used to go and see movies like Goldfinger, Bullitt, and Hooper.  The last movie I saw there was City Heat, with Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds.  It's a grand old theater built in 1930, though only partially restored.  In a way, being converted into the Copernicus Cultural and Civic Center twenty years ago saved it, as it would probably have been multiplexed to remain commercially viable otherwise.  We sat in the second row of the balcony, which I recall was usually closed when I went there as a kid.  Not only did going there bring back a flood of memories for me, it brought in a flood of people!  The movie had to be delayed 20 minutes or so to allow all the folks to get in. This giant movie palace was rockin' with almost 2,000 moviegoers at $15 a head!  I ran into many old friends I hadn't seen in years, including the self-styled 'Ed Wood of the 90s', movie director David 'The Rock' Nelson, who was his usual enthusiastic self.

And this movie was one of them along with counterparts such as Dancer in the Dark, Eraserhead, Salo, Bad Lieutenant etc. As you might have probably understood, those movies are not so pleasant to watch. Anyways, when I was in a Blockbuster in Boston, I have seen RFAD and I have remembered it from that site. I have rented the unrated uncut version and went back to my dorm, I immediately put it in my VCR. To be honest, before watching it, I didn't expect to much because the tagline says ' the downward spiral of for people because of drugs'. I thought this was another junkie movie. Boy was I wrong. When the last credits started to roll. I was in a state of shock. All I could do is to call my mom in Turkey at 2AM and sobbing like a baby for 35 minutes.This can give you the idea. I consider my self as a pretty jaded person and I am not easily affected by movies(Except Schindler's list because I am jewish). But in RFAD's case this is not true. From my Perspective, This movie is THE BEST again THE BEST movie that has ever been put on celluloid, BY FAR. Never once in life before have I seen a gut-wrentching, heart-shattering and horrifying movie like this. This movie is a sad tragedy. The level of its tragedy can be just equaled by King Lear or Macbeth.MILD SPOILERS BELOW!!!The movie is about four human-beings. Sara Golfarb, His son, son's friend, and son's lover. The mother is a lonely old women who wants to be on television but to make it real she should fit into her ostentatious red dress. The son Harry and his girl friend Marion are junkies whose major dream is to open a fashion store and Harry's friend Tyrone is also a junkie who wants to be a 'somebody' to reach happiness. But their goals were bullied by their addictions and as the movie goes ahead we see the hell got broke loose.I don't want to spoil the film by telling the significant details of it but what I have to say is this is the most intense, realistic, horrifying journey that I have ever attampted to join. If you are a human, than there is no way that you cannot be affected by this flick. Especially the last 20 minute montage of this film is so powerful and so sad that a faint of heart or a squemish may want to throw himself from the window. But this shouldn't fool you because although it is not a pleasant film to watch, this doesn't mean that it is bad infact for me it is the best film of all time as I mentioned numerously.The cinematic aspects of this film are no less then spectacular. The acting is the best one could ever attempt to see. I meant the ensemble cast but Ellen Burstyn steals the show as the desperate lonely mother. Giving the Oscar to Julia Roberts in stead of Ellen Burstyn is a laugh riot. The other actor are also more than amazing. They should have gotten at least an Academy Award nomination but who are we kidding ha!!!. The cinematography is one of the best, the directing and film editing is simply groundbreaking with hip-hop montages, split screens, reverse angels and close ups. A solid script and The most haunting score that has never been listened to since Schindler's list. The score perfectly matches with the progression of the movie infact it may be the third crucial element to make this movie the best of motion picture history, after the acting and the directing.Also the movie deeply focuses of the weak parts of the American society. For me The T.V and show obsession of Sara Goldfarb is a reflection of the entertainment obsessed Americans. MILD SPOILER HERE!!! When Sara went to the Diet Doctor to complain about the diet pills, doctor just didn't pay attention to Sara and said she will be allright. For me it symbolizes the isolation of American people from others. Also the loneliness of Sara is very American because I don't know a nation except Americans that the people just have to rely on themselves so much that they plan to be alone. As an individual in life Americans are pathetically lonely. And Tyrone's case. MILD SPOILER HERE!!! When Tyrone was dreaming of his childhood he said to his mom that one day he is gonna be a big man. I think that sentence was put intentionally in the film to criticise that America is also a success obsessed nation that emposes 'if you are not somebody, than you are nobody' ideology to its citizens END OF THE MILD SPOILER!!!. And these seperate things are perfectly matching with the sub plots of RFAD.Overall, This is the best film of the cinema history. Also very provacative and thought-provoking about learning the darker side of American culture by its critisizations. RFAD should have gotten 12 Oscar for Best Picture, Best Director(Darren Aronofsky), Best Actress in a leading role(Ellen Burstyn), Best Actor in a Leading Role(Jared Leto), Best Actress in a supporting role(Jennifer Conelly), Best Actor in a supporting role(Marlon Wayans), Best Original Score(Clint Mansell and the Kronos quartet). Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound an Best Sound editing but thanks to the blatant hypocrasy of the beloved Academy. Also this is a very harsh movie that never loses the high level of emotion while viewing more than once. I have watched it 18 times so far and every time I watch it I pray to have a stone in stead of my heart for not being heavily affected. Thank god for letting me to witness the zenith of cinematic beauty at the age of 20.On a scale of 1 to 10, this movie is 1.000.000.000.000\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 August 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  When I was surfing on the internet, I have seen a article about the most 25 disturbing films of all time ..

Robert Rodriguez is the writer and director of such bloody, ultra-violent action fair as `Desperado', `From Dusk &#145;Till Dawn' and &#145;The Faculty' (my favorite), so it comes as kind of a surprise to see him diving neck-deep into this PG-rated family film. Rodriguez is an imaginative filmmaker, and with Spy Kids more then ever before that imagination is let loose like a wild dog to ravage every aspect of the production. This gives us some gleaming moments like a fight scene inside a rapidly spinning merry-go &#145;round and  a surprise bit in the final scene involving a cameo from George Clooney that is pretty ingenious. In fact, the real stars of the film are not Antonio Bandaris and Carla Gugino and not even the spy kids (Alexa Vega and  Daryl Sabara), but the `thumb soldiers'.  Life-size beings whose limbs (`arms', `legs', and `head') are made of nothing but giant thumbs, the thumb soldiers are one of those rare special effect creations that show us something we've never seen before. It needs to be seen to be believed. Rodriguez has them fumbling and sliding around, trying to catch things and at one point breaking into a home in ski masks and full fatigues. It is hilarious. Rodriguez throws so much at as, with such vibrant visuals and at such a frenzied pace we don't quite grasp how cheesy and unsatisfying the movie is until it settles down a bit in the 3rd act when it gets past the parade of visual bits and attempts to pull together the strings and resolve it's story.  It's like being dropped out of a tornado and shaking your head wondering where you are &#150; and why you've been putting up with this kind of stuff. The movie doesn't fall apart scene by scene like many others. Instead, I just started getting the sinking impression that what I was seeing - and what I had been seeing - was a movie that was not going to grow beyond it's set-up and amount to much. It's not even necessarily that the screenplay did anything to snap me away from it (accept for, maybe, a scene where Vega's robot punches through a concrete pillar), but as it progressed I just more and more, felt the potential (and potential charm) being drained away and it pulling at my tolerance. Instead of building on itself, it seems to just be throwing whatever Rodriguez thinks might look cool at us. He gives us a fairly original set-up and then runs his kids through the type of lame action scenes we've grown so tired of in adult movies. The family friendly twists can only sustain the movie so long.  Rodriguez also aims to satirize nonsensical children's programming &#150; similar to The Teletubbies. But what might have sounded good on the page doesn't play out as edgy and topical as it wants to be. It just seems creepy. The always engaging Alan Cumming (fresh off `Josie and the Pussycats') as the villain of the piece gets strained through Rodriguez's mainstream kid's movie template and falls out the other side looking foolish and giving typical syrupy motivational speeches. The premise is one of child empowerment. I can't help but admire Rodriguez more as a director for going for this, but it's not like he is breaking any new ground here &#150; this is a pretty standard kid movie theme. His movie strains to be hip and twisted, but then will fall back on usual cornball antics and pounding in sappy messages about the importance of family. It's an incredibly awkward mix. While Bandaris and Gugino are the big stars and get the big credits, the centerpieces of the movie are the two young leads. Vega and Sabara carry the movie like pros, and without being shackled with any cute kid antics. Alexa Vega, in particular, could be a big star in the making.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"2 August 2003","score":"","review":"  Final Score 6.5 (out of 10)&#145;Spy Kids' is as radical and daring a change of pace as it comes for a filmmaker. Robert Rodriguez is the writer and director of such bloody, ultra-violent action fair as `Desperado', `From Dusk &#145;Till Dawn' and &#145;The Faculty' (my favorite), so it comes as kind of a surprise to see him diving neck-deep into this PG-rated family film. Rodriguez is an imaginative filmmaker, and with Spy Kids more then ever before that imagination is let loose like a wild dog to ravage every aspect of the production. This gives us some gleaming moments like a fight scene inside a rapidly spinning merry-go &#145;round and  a surprise bit in the final scene involving a cameo from George Clooney that is pretty ingenious. In fact, the real stars of the film are not Antonio Bandaris and Carla Gugino and not even the spy kids (Alexa Vega and  Daryl Sabara), but the `thumb soldiers'.  Life-size beings whose limbs (`arms', `legs', and `head') are made of nothing but giant thumbs, the thumb soldiers are one of those rare special effect creations that show us something we've never seen before. It needs to be seen to be believed. Rodriguez has them fumbling and sliding around, trying to catch things and at one point breaking into a home in ski masks and full fatigues. It is hilarious. Rodriguez throws so much at as, with such vibrant visuals and at such a frenzied pace we don't quite grasp how cheesy and unsatisfying the movie is until it settles down a bit in the 3rd act when it gets past the parade of visual bits and attempts to pull together the strings and resolve it's story.  It's like being dropped out of a tornado and shaking your head wondering where you are &#150; and why you've been putting up with this kind of stuff. The movie doesn't fall apart scene by scene like many others. Instead, I just started getting the sinking impression that what I was seeing - and what I had been seeing - was a movie that was not going to grow beyond it's set-up and amount to much. It's not even necessarily that the screenplay did anything to snap me away from it (accept for, maybe, a scene where Vega's robot punches through a concrete pillar), but as it progressed I just more and more, felt the potential (and potential charm) being drained away and it pulling at my tolerance. Instead of building on itself, it seems to just be throwing whatever Rodriguez thinks might look cool at us. He gives us a fairly original set-up and then runs his kids through the type of lame action scenes we've grown so tired of in adult movies. The family friendly twists can only sustain the movie so long.  Rodriguez also aims to satirize nonsensical children's programming &#150; similar to The Teletubbies. But what might have sounded good on the page doesn't play out as edgy and topical as it wants to be. It just seems creepy. The always engaging Alan Cumming (fresh off `Josie and the Pussycats') as the villain of the piece gets strained through Rodriguez's mainstream kid's movie template and falls out the other side looking foolish and giving typical syrupy motivational speeches. The premise is one of child empowerment. I can't help but admire Rodriguez more as a director for going for this, but it's not like he is breaking any new ground here &#150; this is a pretty standard kid movie theme. His movie strains to be hip and twisted, but then will fall back on usual cornball antics and pounding in sappy messages about the importance of family. It's an incredibly awkward mix.

Also after watching this movie, I feel you cannot escape asking yourself `What is my favourite pet?' I have had two favourite pets, one was my father's boarder collie-cross kelpie sheep dog, called &#145;Lassie', who was a fantastic dog, both as a worker for my father, and a family pet for my Sister and I when we were growing up. I have never forgotten the night she died. But these days, my family's oldest cat, a pure tortoiseshell cat, would have to rank as my favourite pet. This is a highly entertaining family movie, with a great humour, sentiment and emotion.  Who says best friends have to be human? Not Willie Morris, who receives a talented terrier named Skip for his birthday. With Skip's remarkable and unconventional help, Willie and Skip turn bullies into friends, tangle with hapless moonshiners, and even win the affections of the prettiest girl in school. Shining with warmth and humour, &#145;My Dog Skip' unleashes a story that will have the entire family sitting up begging for more.Director, Jay Russell, did a fine job with this movie. I loved all the shots with the dogs that play &#145;Skip', as these were done with great class and emotion by Russell. He also re-created the time for the movie beautifully, and handled all of the young performers in the movie very well, because they stood out to me every time they were onscreen, none more so, then Frankie Muniz. Also, having the movie only run for little under an hour and a half, was the perfect length, which I am sure Jay has to take the credit for.   The story for &#145;MDS' was based on the true story, written by Willie Morris, a very intelligent story indeed. The screenplay for the film was adapted by Gail Gilchriest, who I am sure, would have had Willie's input many times. Gilchriest added in a large amount of story for both Skip and Willie and showed Willie's life to be very unpleasant many times. But the great parts about this script are its &#145;emotional and very human side', which I know I will not forget for along time to come Willie Morris (played by a very young Frankie Muniz) was perfectly casted in his role. Before seeing this film, I have found Muniz to be an unusual kind of actor, mainly because of his role in the weird and dysfunctional TV-comedy &#145;Malcolm in the Middle'. But after seeing him in this film, he convinced me how talented he really was. I also think that Muniz needs to be commended for how well he acted with the two dogs in the film, as this was vital to final make-up of the film. Willie's parents, Jack (Kevin Bacon) and Ellen (Unfathful's Diane Lane) were perfect choices as the conservative parents. I especially like how Ellen tries to makes Willie's life as good as it can be, considering the barrage of abusive he receives. Jack is a very wise man, and tells his wife that letting a dog come into their son's life could be harmful, because he will become attached to the animal and love it. He is afraid Willie could be hurt via the animal. Willie has a great relationship with his next door neighbour, the famous Baseballer Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson). Wilson is convincing as Dink, especially when he returns from serving in the 2nd World War. He is a very dark type of character, after that event.The town characters are also interesting to see on the screen. Willie's enemies\/friends are entertaining to watch see go from one stage to another, thanks to the help of Skip. Willie also gets the girl of any boy's dreams, that of Rivers Applewhite (Caitlin Wachs). The townfolk love the cute little dog of the Morris's, especially the local butcher, Barney (Bill Butler). However there is one person that we do not see, but only hear his voice in the film. The narrator (Harry Connick Jnr.) is the very deep voice of a much older and wiser Willie Morris. I really like Connick's part in the film, as it is not unlike that of Alec Baldwin's voiceover performance in &#145;The Royal Tenenbaums'.Much of the credit for the film, has to go the two dogs trained in the film. Skip (Enzo and Moose), were extremely well trained in the film, by animal trainer Maltilda de Cagny. I loved every scene with Skip in it, as it would bring a smile almost every time. But the best scene has to be when Skip is causing a stir through Mississippi, with Willie and Ellen. I could not stop laughing. My only disappointment after seeing this film for a second time is that I wish I had had a dog just like &#145;Skip'. My reasoning is because I had an indifferent time as child, being picked on like Willie was in the film. I really could have used a friend like &#145;Skip'. When I compare this movie to other movie and TV experiences I have had, I think of an old TV show called &#145;The littlest Ho-Bo', which featured a big German shepherd, who wandered from town to town helping many people on his journey. It was very similar to &#145;My Dog Skip', as it had great emotion, and was one of my favourite TV shows as a child. This film and &#145;October Sky', while handling completely different stories and age groups for that matter, are similar qualities of movies. However, &#145;My Dog Skip' is just a little better from where I viewed it. If you have not seen this movie, then I can only recommend you do.

Well shoot, if you do forget all you know about Muhammad Ali then you'll exit the film knowing almost nothing about the man. As a Muhammad Ali fan I thought this film didn't do the great man any justice.  It reveals nothing new about Ali, in fact it makes his entire life story seem less interesting than it is.From the outset it is clear that director Michael Mann has taken an odd approach to filming Ali, as we see grainy (wince inducing) visuals of Will Smith on a roof top, possibly to add to its sort of documentary approach, but all it adds to is a headache.I don't understand why he chose to make it like a documentary because it you watch any program about Muhammad Ali then it will consist entirely of grainy news reel footage, which brings an automatic comparison between the two and unfortunatly the film doesn't stand a chance because you can immediatly see that the film is horribly fake.  Recreating news reel footage is hardly ever sucessful especially when it recreates such famous scenes which everybody knows.Will Smith is the one of the only praise worthy things about this film.  He is beefed up to the size of Ali in his prime and 'does' his rapid talking well, except the filmmaking style lets him down immensely because his 'big' scenes are all recreations of what we have seen already in Muhammad Ali documentaries on tv.  I understand what is trying to be achieved, except the comparisons between real and fake make a huge difference, which makes Will Smith appear not as a character, but as Will Smith pretending to be Muhammad Ali.  I know this is the concept of film, to pretend your somebody else, except this is an exception where it just doesn't work.The fight scenes are horrible.  It is not rapid editing which spoils them, but the lazy camera work which is meant to bring you into the middle of the fight, except leaves you with wobbly views of the fighters backs and legs.  It is a fatal blow for a boxing film. Perhaps this was to avoid copying the style of Raging Bull, but it is worse off for it.The performances, besides Smith, are hazy and uninteresting. Mario Van Peebles is Malcolm X, but his importance to the plot actually relies on the viewer having knowledge of him and Ali to understand his importance (which makes the films Tagline pointless) as he and Ali's relationship is very distant and unspecific.  The two actresses who play Muhammad Ali's first and second wives are also completely worthless, and do not add anything to the film.The one other bright spot of the film is John Voight as Howard Cosell.  Although only appearing in a few scenes, he steals the entire film from Will Smith because his performance can match the original news reel footage perfectly and therefore 'is' that character.As a boxing film Ali is well below par.

Part way through watching this movie, I felt that Mel Gibson was born to play the role of Mad Max, as he suits the character that was created. I was thinking that this film might have had a very 'Hollywood' feel to it. But to my surprise, I was glad to see and hear a very Australian flavour continuing, which has accompanied all the Mad Max movies to date.Two men enter. One man leaves. That is the law in Bartertown's Thunderdome arena. But lawmaker Aunty Entity will soon add another Do not get Max mad! Max is back as the hero who takes on the barbarians of the post-nuclear future - and this time becomes the savior of a tribe of lost children. However, the power-mad Aunty Entity, a dominatrix, is determined to use Max to tighten her stranglehold on Bartertown.What was lacking in the second of the Mad Max movies was its script, which seemed to be underdeveloped, so I was hoping that the 'Beyond Thunderdome' would be better. Thankfully it was, as there was a lot more dialogue, some intriguing characters, and an even better story, which contained a lot of entertaining elements. I especially like the location of Bartertown, as it still had an 'Australian feel' to it, the idea of the Thunderdome was well explained and shown through the story. Then to have Max, be the protector of all these children made the story just that much better. MM3 was written once again by George Miller and Terry Hayes.But George Miller also did so much more. He directed the third movie, giving it all the necessary touches that have made Mad Max, the movies they are today. Helping Miller in the director's chair is another George, director George Ogilvie. Having two directors I think only enhances the movie all the more. I like the way we see the famous 'Thunderdome' fighting scene, as Miller and Ogilvie focused very much on that event and the many elements within it. I also like the grand view of the open desert that we see numerous times through out the film, as both directors certainly wanted us to see that the conditions surrounding Bartertown were pretty harsh to both humans and animals. Credit for this section of the movie has to also go to the cinematographer, Dean Semler, who shot some great camera angles of the deserts.MM3 also had some fine performers. Mad Max (Mel Gibson) shows that he is still a force to be reckoned with. His introduction to Aunty Entity (Tina Turner) was highly entertaining, as Max takes an impossible situation to show that he is a person not to be taken lightly. Max, for part of this movie, has long hair, which I believe gives Max an even more silent, heroic, darker edge to his character. However I was not a big fan of Tina Turner's performance in the film, as she did not seem at all in her place as an actress, but the look of her character was effective. Tina sings the song 'We don't need another hero' for the movie's soundtrack.I also liked the actors with minor roles in the film. Max is told to separate Master-blaster, who is two identities. There is the very small and intelligent Master (Angelo Rossitto), and the very muscular Blaster (Paul Larsson), who Max has the huge encounter with in the Thunderdome. There was also a very Australian feel to this cast. Pigkiller (Robert Grubb) was a peculiar character that I immediately liked. He genuinely wants to help Max's cause in any way he can. Of the nastier looking guys, you have Ironbar (Angry Anderson), who might not have much to say, but has many lives in the film. In fact, many incidents with him are humorous and breathtaking as well. Back in MM3 is Jedediah (Bruce Spence), who now has a son, Jedediah Jnr. (Adam Cockburn). Max and Jedediah have a very clear understanding, which continues here. Another major component to the film is the use of pigs. I will not say why they are used here, just that I liked their presence every time they were onscreen.There are some amazing scenes attached to MM3. I have to agree that the film contains one the best movie fight scenes ever, as Max and gladiatorial Blaster face off with maces, chainsaws and anything not nailed down inside Thunderdome. It is truly an exhilarating scene to see playing out, (although I cringed when I saw Max drop-start the chainsaw). However the customary car chase scene, which MM is famous for, was not as great here, as in the previous two movies. But it did have the fun sequence showing Ironbar barely escaping with his life many times. I enjoyed the lead up scenes to the car chase, as they had a lot of action and involvement of many people from the cast.While, I like the characters we see in this movie, I do not believe they are as well developed as the people created for the first movie, as they were a lot easier to get to know, love and understand. I guess the big question after this movie is, 'which Mad Max is better, one or three?' I am still a bigger fan of the original, as it is a great film, showing that a small budget filmmaking can be very successful. That does not mean I am not a fan of this film, because I am. 'Beyond Thunderdome' had such a fine conclusion, that perhaps they should have left the 'status quo'. But hearing that a 4th film in the series is being made as we speak, says to me, that Mel Gibson, George Miller and his talented crew have more in store for Mad Max fans.

I enjoyed the lead up scenes to the car chase, as they had a lot of action and involvement of many people from the cast.While, I like the characters we see in this movie, I do not believe they are as well developed as the people created for the first movie, as they were a lot easier to get to know, love and understand. I guess the big question after this movie is, 'which Mad Max is better, one or three?' I am still a bigger fan of the original, as it is a great film, showing that a small budget filmmaking can be very successful. That does not mean I am not a fan of this film, because I am. 'Beyond Thunderdome' had such a fine conclusion, that perhaps they should have left the 'status quo'. But hearing that a 4th film in the series is being made as we speak, says to me, that Mel Gibson, George Miller and his talented crew have more in store for Mad Max fans. I cannot wait!CMRS gives 'Mad Max - Beyond Thunderdome' 3.5 (Good - Very Good Film)  ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"}]
