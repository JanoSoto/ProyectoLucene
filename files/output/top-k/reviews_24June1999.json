It is a movie that does not depend on action or  special effects to generate engagement in an audience, but depth, morals and meaning. The movie is directed by John Turteltaub, who is at a career high with Instinct, an almost certain Oscar contender for best picture.The story is emotional, but never sappy or childish. It stars Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs) as Dr. Ethan Powell, a wildlife scientist who decides to move to Africa for his personal studies for a few years, leaving his family behind. Once there and grown accustomed to the environment and surroundings, he chooses to take pictures of the gorillas in person, and begins to develop a relationship with a particular ape family. He then makes the decision the become part of their family. For two years he lives in harmony, peace and spirituality with these animals, who now except him as one of their own, until something very violent and murderous happens, leaving Powell to be sent to an American psychiatric institute.While arriving, Powell once again does something vicious, nearly killing several security guard officers. But this time, his family watch in horror as their father and husband, whom they haven't seen in more than two years, does this terrible act of violence, almost certainly sentencing him to a top security institute, which does indeed happen.What could have triggered this attack? What could make a family man kill several people like a wild animal and then injure more? Why would Ethan Powell give up a successful career, a loving family and a fairly decent life to live with the apes for two years? These are the questions that Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr. from Jerry Maguire), a novice psychiatrist, has to answer. What makes this task even more difficult the man hasn't said a word to anyone in years.The institute that Powell has been taken to is cruelty in the highest. The prisoners are beaten and shocked with a stun gun if they get rowdy, one random person a day is chosen to go outside for thirty minutes, and their rights and nothing more than the playing cards that the guards use to choose the lucky outsiders. Powell is treated like a wild animal, thus acts like one.The movie's development of the above is very understandable and becomes more in depth when Theo starts to question Powell's strange behavior. The story is told though Powell himself, the problem and solution of the movie. Through flashbacks and lessons taught to Theo, we fully realize the potential and ethics this movie is trying to prove to us.The prison scenes are vivid and disturbing, but also involving and realistic. The characters in the institute are fully realized and understood, creating an emotional relationship with the audience. Also the jungle and wildlife sequences, blossoming the Hopkins character with sheer sensibility and gentleness with provocative instincts. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s first leading role turns out to be a wise gamble. For he is capable of handling a baseline character without stumbling upon meaning and providing an audience's perspective. Donald Sutherland (Virus, 1999) isn't all that bad either.There was a scene in Instinct where a man is using force to control another person, who is being taught a lesson on control itself. This scene provides us with the concept that no one ever has firm control over a situation; it is just an illusion. Instinct is a movie of  true values, fair beliefs and hard theories.

That's because the TV showings were purposefully padded to two parts with more than an hour of extra footage that in this case places the characters in much better context than they appear in the theatrical version, (don't get me wrong, it doesn't elevate it to a topnotch story, but at least the narrative makes better sense).  The biggest revelation upon seeing the theatrical cut was how all of George Kennedy's scenes before the crash weren't there any more.Even at it's best, Airport 77 is only par for the course as far as disaster movies go.  The plot is a little more innovative and the rescue scenes of trying to survive and then get the plane raised are more realistic than what we were served up in Airport 1975 with the stewardess flying the plane. Jack Lemmon does succeed as the nominal lead and that helps make one more charitable toward the rest of the supporting cast which is largely wasted in some classic, stereotyped cliched roles.  But towards the end, it starts to drag just a bit.  You can also see the beginnings of Jimmy Stewart's declining health since he's basically forced to play his part as though he were appearing as a guest on the Johnny Carson show instead of making his character more distinctive.The widescreen DVD is worth having but I strongly recommend catching the expanded TV version instead, even if it is panned and scanned.
