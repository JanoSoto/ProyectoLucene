Even the voice acting is terrific, but I don't recommend this movie to everyone, even if It's great and worth.Shrek is hilarious. The plot is interesting and brings you laughs. It shows the fantastic story of Shrek, a monster that every human hates. I will only say that, nothing else. While the story is great, and funny, I don't recommend this to everyone, because rarely, but critically the story might be not worth for some people, and they might think It is dumb. But, Shrek is brought mostly to laugh, and I'm really glad that I liked the story, and I didn't thought It was bad.Great voice acting and fantastic animation makes this movie a great movie. I was enjoyed seeing the animations, and laughing by the hilarious plot, and characters. The voice acting, especially, makes the movie funny.It's worth, and great, buy it, ENJOY IT!8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 August 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Shrek is fantastically animated, with a stylish and unique story.
