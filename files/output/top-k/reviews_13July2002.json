As the highest achieving student in senior high - she's been in every club and the president of everything possible. She manages to incense one of her teachers, played by Matthew Broderick. He's lost his best friend due to her intellectual attachment that turned sexual to his former best friend and teacher at the school, and is irritated at her rabid go-getter attitude and the sense that she feels better and more deserving than anyone else.

The innocent boy he enlists win, but only by a vote, because Broderick has thrown a couple of ballots away which would have made Tracey the winner.This movie is FUNNY, due to Witherspoon's intense competetive Tracey, who CANNOT accept defeat, and the things that ensue after she is found to be the winner after all.There are other stories going on, a lesbian affair by the popular boy's sister that turns out miserably, with her moping and strange thoughts, Brodericks unfaithfulness to his wife, and believe it or not there is the driest humor and wit in these stories as well as in the main one.I thought this the only good teenage film worth watching at all besides Clueless in the past decade.As the so very aggresive and positive Tracey, Witherspoon shined.

Tenoch is the son of the Secretary of State under the PRI government.  Julio comes from an upper-middle-class family with leftist politics.  Not that these kids care about these things.  What they care about is getting stoned, having sex, swimming and masturbation.  When their girlfriends leave for a trip to Europe, the boys are down to only three things to keep their interest and they assume they are going to have a boring summer.Then Tenoch's father hosts a family wedding at his mansion.  All of Mexico's social & political elite are required to attend.  That includes Tenoch's insufferably pretentious cousin Jano and his beautiful Spanish wife Luisa.  When the boys bump into Luisa, they both start hitting on her at once.  They tell her they know of a beach far away from tourists called Heaven's Mouth that is the most beautiful place in the tropics and they will take her there whenever she wants.  Of course they are just making it up, and Jano chases them off before they can go any further.Some time later Jano phones Luisa in tears and admits he's been cheating on her.  So Luisa phones Tenoch & calls his bluff.  She wants to go to Heavens Mouth with the boys.  So they all get together & borrow a rickety 1983 Dodge station wagon from Julio's sister & take a cross-country journey in which they will all discover themselves, each other & Mexico.The most up-front part of the film is the sexual part.  This is only the second non-porn film I have seen that features a money shot, which is why it couldn't be released in the U.S. with an MPAA rating (the first film--if you're interested--is Pedro Almodovar's Kika).  There is lots of nudity and sex on display and even more conversation about it.  The conversations are of a highly explicit nature and may be even more shocking than the actual sex scenes.But there is another, more subtle part.  The journey they take is an odyssey into the real Mexico  a place of incredible poverty & despair, but also a place of great freedom.  It is a place that neither Tenoch's nor Julio's family wants to acknowledge.  The authoritarian, right-wing PRI wants to sweep the poverty under the rug & clamp down on the freedom.  The upper-class Zapatista-sympathizers are too busy organizing demonstrations to do anything constructive about the poverty & take themselves too seriously to enjoy--or even acknowledge--their freedom.  I would have probably missed this subtext had it not been for the narrative voice which talks about the despair & freedom (as well as the characters' life histories) that occur off-screen.There are flaws of course.  The pacing in the first act--before the wedding--is a bit slow, and the narration interrupts the flow of the story a bit too much.But the acting and story are superb.  I had assumed at first that the two boys were really stoner kids until (*SPOILER ALERT*) the final scene where they are reunited as men in their twenties--played by the same actors, but with radically different characterizations.  And the cinematography can only be described as stunning.  Especially the scenes where the boys race each other swimming.Overall, this film succeeds on both the coming-of-age and social commentary front, which is no small feat.  And it crackles with all of the attitude that the title (translated And Your Mother Too) implies.  8 out of 10.

Mom maintains (or tries to) the values of a dying generation despite having abandoned her once-loved skills as a cook for the convenience of store bought fried chicken heated up in a sparkling white microwave.The center of the story is the loud arrival of representatives with a Strip, Gouge and Build development company out to convert the town and the black residential area into what much of South Florida has already experienced growth.  Sweet deals are offered with the usual soft but clearly understood threat - Sell out now or lose big time later.  Among the developer's flacks is Jack, (Timothy Hutton).  His relationship with Marnie, intrigued by his credentials as a landscape designer, is interesting without detracting from the main issues. Both play their parts very well.Hollywood has always recognized the American love of land ownership and the desire, actually the fanatical imperative,  to improve every last acre, one way or another.  Westerns have been the major cinematic vehicle showing the soul-deep attachment to land ownership with films running from the fierce (Legend of the Fall) to the comedic (Cat Ballou) to the epic (How the West Was Won).  Violence always predominates.Now John Sayles has given us the dilemma of competing values and needs. Ecological and environmental issues are recognized but they're not the whole enchilada by a long shot and therein lies the subtlety and challenge of this film.While there is a little outright criminality by the developers in trying to buy a local pol's vote, the real tension is between those who want to hold on to a way of life they profess to cherish while understanding that change - and profit - attract mightily.  These locals are, with the exception of several elderly black people, not defenders of a hallowed heritage but people suddenly caught up in an opportunity to make more money than they ever thought they could realize from their land.  Indeed, one character - the chief booster of the town's increasingly unattended historically rootless annual festival - says at its conclusion and without a hint of irony that it's hard to invent a tradition.It's the very absence of the callous and even deadly criminality marking several of the recent environmental lawsuit films that makes this story fascinating.  The ambiguities remain with the viewer after the theater lights go on.  Is there a right and a wrong here?  One character trying to buy up land responds to a charge of acting unfairly by saying that no one is being forced to sell land it's purely private choice. What does choice mean here?  The role of law in controlling such choices is, for most of the film, shadowy at best.  The ending is a bit of a cop-out but not enough to be bothersome.The interwoven personal stories are interesting because they're very well-acted and are about people and problems we understand.Were I to teach courses in Property, Real Estate or Environmental Law I'd schedule a mandatory viewing of Sunshine State for the students. The bright sun lighting up the Florida locale where the film was shot illuminates dilemmas faced in much of this country.And don't skip out without hearing the songs accompanying the end credits!!!!!

They are not. They are boring, poorly acted, poorly directed, and Lucas's gold mine of easy money (no matter how bad the movie is).I believe a good share of the boredom is the fact that we as the audience already know whats going to happen before we even go to see the movie. There are very few suprises, and very little sense of adventure. I also believe that the time span in between the trilogies is to blame. There are all new people making the movie, Lucas is not the same person he was then, and the new actors\/actresses all add to the growing boredom throughout the movie. The first hour of episode two seems like an entirely useless way to re-affirm that the princess is still in danger as she was in episode one, and to set up a weak romance. All of it could have been written into the little scrolling info at the beginning. The last half and hour was the only semi-interesting piece of the whole ordeal. I thought the best part of the movie was the few scenes where r2d2 and c3p0 were on their own (Lucas managed to not entirely wreck these characters)It seems as though a large budget film could have afforded actors, who could actually act. Portman although extremely hot, was incredibly boring to watch, especially throughout her 'bonding' with Anakin. Her performance reminded me of the Planet of the Apes Remake, in which Mark Wahlberg is able to fall in love with the lead actress (don't remember her name) after exchanging about two lines of dialogue the entire movie. There was no emotional element to her, her diplomatic character, and personal character were the same dull person.

His performance was one of the worst ive ever seen by an adult actor.I feel like I could go on and on pointing out flaws in episode two but i just wish someone could have pointed them out on the set or in the editing room, because then i could enjoy the new Star Wars. Oh well, in conclusion I don't think Episode 2 is even worth the watch (especially if you have to pay for it) if you've already figured out what happened, and don't want to see the roots of the Empire and Vader skip it, if however you want to see some poor acting and dialogue to remind yourself what a bad movie is then check it out, its perfect.

It was, as far as I can remember, the most disturbing movie I've ever watched and when I started doing some math in my head the next day, I got very, very queasy.

As one of the characters so tellingly puts it at one point, `I'm not anywhere close to being the man I thought I'd be--' and the denial, that failure to accept the fact that time stands still for no man, and the inability to choose which path to take when you hit that inevitable fork in the road, forms the basis for director Ted Demme's examination of how human nature affects the process of maturating, in `Beautiful Girls,' a drama featuring Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon and a young Natalie Portman.Willie Conway (Hutton) is back home in the Midwest for his high school reunion, but more than that, to try and make some decisions about his future.  He finds that nothing much has changed-- the town, or his old friends, most of whom seem to be exerting more time and energy attempting to cling to what was, rather than moving on with their lives.  Tommy Rowland (Dillon), for instance, the high school `hero,' as it were, now drives a snowplow; for all intents and purposes, his life `peaked' in high school, and he can't seem to get past it.  Then there's Paul (Michael Rapaport), who just doesn't seem to want to grow up; after a seven year relationship with Jan (Martha Plimpton), he refuses to make that final commitment-- after all, `What's the rush?'All of which does nothing to help Willie with his own dilemma; the only words of wisdom he gets from anyone, in fact, come from the precocious thirteen-year-old, Marty (Natalie Portman), who lives next door.  But in a couple of days, Tracy (Annabeth Gish), the girl Willie `thinks' he wants to marry, is due to arrive from Chicago, so it's time to move beyond the crossroads; for Willie, it's decision time.Demme delivers a story that just about everyone in the audience is going to connect with on some level, because everyone's gone through (or will go through) these kinds of things at one time or another.  Who hasn't experienced, if only for a moment, that sense of either wanting to stay as they are or going back to what they were, when life was better, or at least simpler.  Or more fun.  Working from a screenplay by Scott Rosenberg, Demme examines the relationships between this eclectic group of individuals in a way that offers some insights into human nature that will no doubt elicit some reflection on the part of the viewer.  It all points up that, no matter what it may look like on the surface, underneath it all we're not so different from one another; we all share that common bond of learning life's lessons one day at a time, albeit in our own particular way, which corresponds to who we are as individuals.  And Demme succeeds in telling his story with warmth and humor; by tapping into the humanity at the heart of it all.The story may focus on Willie, but the film is a true ensemble piece, realized as it is through the sum of it's many and varied parts.  It's a talented cast of actors bringing a unique bunch of characters to life that makes this film what it is, beginning with Hutton, who anchors it with his solid portrayal of Willie, a challenging role in that Willie has to be an average guy who is unique in his own right.  The same can be said of Dillon's Tommy, in whom traces of Dallas Winston from `The Outsiders' can be found; Tommy is, perhaps, just Dallas a few years later.Mira Sorvino gives a memorable performance by creating the most sympathetic character in the film, Tommy's girlfriend, Sharon.  This is the girl who was never going to be prom queen, and who up until now has lacked the self-confidence necessary to create a positive environment for herself.  Lauren Holly, meanwhile, succeeds with her portrayal of Darian Smalls, the absolute opposite of Sharon, a young woman who is probably too positive for her own good and who lives the life of a perpetual prom queen, an individual who-- as another character succinctly puts it-- was `Mean as a snake,' back in the day.  Good performances that add a balanced perspective to the film.There are two performances here that really steal the show, however.  The first being that of Michael Rapaport, who as Paul so completely and convincingly captures the very essence of an average Joe with not too much on the ball, no prospects for the future to speak of, but who is, at heart, a good guy.  There's humor and pathos in his portrayal, which personifies that particular state of being the film is seeking to depict.  Excellent work by Rapaport, and decidedly one of the strengths of the film.The most memorable performance of all, however, is turned in by Natalie Portman, who at fifteen is playing the thirteen-year-old Marty, the girl mature and wise beyond her years (`I'm an old soul,' as she puts it), with whom Willie forms a kind of bond as she, in her own way, helps him to sort out his feelings and find his focus.  Portman's performance here-- some three years before she would forever become Padme Amidala-- exhibits that spark and charismatic screen presence that has served her so well since, in films like `Anywhere But Here,' and `Where the Heart Is.'  She has for some time been, and continues to be, one of the finest and most promising young actors in the business.The cast also includes Noah Emmerich (Mo), Rosie O'Donnell (Gina), Max Perlich (Kev), Uma Thurman (Andrea), Anne Bobby (Sarah) and Pruitt Taylor Vince (Stanley), all of whom help to make `Beautiful Girls' a memorable and satisfying cinematic experience.  And that's the magic of the movies.  8\/10.

But in a couple of days, Tracy (Annabeth Gish), the girl Willie `thinks' he wants to marry, is due to arrive from Chicago, so it's time to move beyond the crossroads; for Willie, it's decision time.Demme delivers a story that just about everyone in the audience is going to connect with on some level, because everyone's gone through (or will go through) these kinds of things at one time or another.  Who hasn't experienced, if only for a moment, that sense of either wanting to stay as they are or going back to what they were, when life was better, or at least simpler.  Or more fun.  Working from a screenplay by Scott Rosenberg, Demme examines the relationships between this eclectic group of individuals in a way that offers some insights into human nature that will no doubt elicit some reflection on the part of the viewer.  It all points up that, no matter what it may look like on the surface, underneath it all we're not so different from one another; we all share that common bond of learning life's lessons one day at a time, albeit in our own particular way, which corresponds to who we are as individuals.  And Demme succeeds in telling his story with warmth and humor; by tapping into the humanity at the heart of it all.The story may focus on Willie, but the film is a true ensemble piece, realized as it is through the sum of it's many and varied parts.  It's a talented cast of actors bringing a unique bunch of characters to life that makes this film what it is, beginning with Hutton, who anchors it with his solid portrayal of Willie, a challenging role in that Willie has to be an average guy who is unique in his own right.  The same can be said of Dillon's Tommy, in whom traces of Dallas Winston from `The Outsiders' can be found; Tommy is, perhaps, just Dallas a few years later.Mira Sorvino gives a memorable performance by creating the most sympathetic character in the film, Tommy's girlfriend, Sharon.  This is the girl who was never going to be prom queen, and who up until now has lacked the self-confidence necessary to create a positive environment for herself.  Lauren Holly, meanwhile, succeeds with her portrayal of Darian Smalls, the absolute opposite of Sharon, a young woman who is probably too positive for her own good and who lives the life of a perpetual prom queen, an individual who-- as another character succinctly puts it-- was `Mean as a snake,' back in the day.  Good performances that add a balanced perspective to the film.There are two performances here that really steal the show, however.  The first being that of Michael Rapaport, who as Paul so completely and convincingly captures the very essence of an average Joe with not too much on the ball, no prospects for the future to speak of, but who is, at heart, a good guy.  There's humor and pathos in his portrayal, which personifies that particular state of being the film is seeking to depict.  Excellent work by Rapaport, and decidedly one of the strengths of the film.The most memorable performance of all, however, is turned in by Natalie Portman, who at fifteen is playing the thirteen-year-old Marty, the girl mature and wise beyond her years (`I'm an old soul,' as she puts it), with whom Willie forms a kind of bond as she, in her own way, helps him to sort out his feelings and find his focus.  Portman's performance here-- some three years before she would forever become Padme Amidala-- exhibits that spark and charismatic screen presence that has served her so well since, in films like `Anywhere But Here,' and `Where the Heart Is.'  She has for some time been, and continues to be, one of the finest and most promising young actors in the business.The cast also includes Noah Emmerich (Mo), Rosie O'Donnell (Gina), Max Perlich (Kev), Uma Thurman (Andrea), Anne Bobby (Sarah) and Pruitt Taylor Vince (Stanley), all of whom help to make `Beautiful Girls' a memorable and satisfying cinematic experience.

As one of the characters so tellingly puts it at one point, `I'm not anywhere close to being the man I thought I'd be--' and the denial, that failure to accept the fact that time stands still for no man, and the inability to choose which path to take when you hit that inevitable fork in the road, forms the basis for director Ted Demme's examination of how human nature affects the process of maturating, in `Beautiful Girls,' a drama featuring Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon and a young Natalie Portman.Willie Conway (Hutton) is back home in the Midwest for his high school reunion, but more than that, to try and make some decisions about his future.  He finds that nothing much has changed-- the town, or his old friends, most of whom seem to be exerting more time and energy attempting to cling to what was, rather than moving on with their lives.  Tommy Rowland (Dillon), for instance, the high school `hero,' as it were, now drives a snowplow; for all intents and purposes, his life `peaked' in high school, and he can't seem to get past it.

Halloween II was a thrill for fans of the original because it literally gave us more of the same, although it left Laurie Strode in a catatonic state for most of the film and giving us boring nurses and orderlies for the wandering Shape to play stalk & slash with. 4-6 painted themselves into a corner with a storyline that attempted to explain Michael Myers, who was so scary because he couldn't be explained.Part 7 reintroduced Curtis to the series by wisely jettisoning the ludicrous sequels and taking its history from the original and Halloween 2, giving us a neurotic Laurie Strode finally having to face the Shape after 20 years of paranoia. The foolish H20 moniker could almost be forgiven, and the brisk pacing made it easy to overlook the silliness of the whole thing and focus on the excitement, culminating when Laurie lops off her boogeyman brother's head with an axe once and for all.Now this.In an introductory explanation that wouldn't get by on an episode of Scooby Doo, we are informed that Michael Myers stealthily crushed the larynx of a convenient paramedic, and then switched outfits with him. It was this paramedic that Laurie hauled off with at the end of H20. It was all a big mistake and the real Michael Myers got away, while Laurie was sent directly to the booby hatch for chopping off his head. Although she does not speak anymore, Laurie secretly dodges her meds (the nurses never notice), and when Mr. Shape inevitably returns to claim her, she is ready. Laurie has somehow even set up an elaborate trap for him on the roof of the asylum, involving a snare built out of a garage door opener (where she got these elements we can only wonder). But it's all for nothing--she falls for a big fakeout and dies, getting a knife in her gut and falling off the roof.At this point, Halloween Resurrection could end. Unfortunately, there are still about 75 minutes left to the film. Director Rick Rosenthal, who directed Halloween II, manages to elicit zero chills in this one. The atmosphere of dread that is essential to the success of a horror film is absolutely missing. Not only that, but the plot is just plain stupid.A group of beautiful young people is gathered in the Myers home on Halloween night as part of an Internet stunt conceived by Busta Rhymes. I doubt you will remember anybody's name after the credits roll. The roles are thankless and the scant amount of personality that the actors manage to inject is quickly exhausted. They wander around the Myers house (locked in, of course) with grainy cameras on their heads so that we can be reminded of Blair Witch Project. Then they are murdered. Some of the early murders even manage to go unnoticed, despite the fact that...well gee, the house can't be that big, can it? Think of your own house. Wouldn't it be real obvious if some screaming person were being hacked to death in the kitchen?The Myers house looks almost nothing like it has in the previous films. We also learn that there is apparently a labyrinthine series of tunnels underneath Haddonfield, which can be accessed through portals in the basements of the homes. Kind of makes the plot of Jason X seem a little more plausible, right?No tension is generated in the film, partly because of the MTV-style editing that obscures the details of the action, and indeed it looks just like a direct-to-video outing. It's even got a groveling television audio mix, where everything is underscored with constant rumbling, spooky music. Then there are the clanking knife sound effects. How can a single knife make a sound like two knives being rubbed together? This movie does not take place in anybody's reality. They might as well have made it an animated feature. The best thing Halloween Resurrection has going for it is some unintentional humor (the campy shots that highlight the bloody tip of Myers's butcher knife) and some amusing references to the earlier films. The actors are powerless to get this dead horse to bolt. Busta Rhymes reveals that he's no Ice-T, and features in one of the movie's most embarrassing sequences when he fights Michael Myers with kung fu moves. In fact, ALL of the roles in this film appear tacked on and contrived. Case in point Tyra Banks's do-nothing role that centers on her wiggling butt and her prowess with a coffee machine. She is so expendable that even her death occurs offscreen.While it was no masterpiece, H20 still carried some curiously powerful imagery, especially in the climactic confrontation where Laurie decapitates the Shape, pausing beforehand to reach out for its hand in an eerily compelling moment. To buy into this film's mythology is to defuse the last good thing about the Halloween series. I ain't buying it.I know Halloween fans will see this movie, just like I did, meaning that the only resurrection going on here is that of Moustapha Akkad's bank account. Now that Laurie Strode is gone from the series, taking the last shred of interest with her, I seriously doubt if even Halloween fans will go to see the excruciatingly inevitable Halloween 9.

This movie cranks up the suspense by having Michael Myers at sometimes pop out of nowhere, and the score gives you that crank of music just at the right time to create an even more atmosphere of terror.

The way her character, Laurie Strode, was killed was cheap and rushed. She went through so much and to end up dead in such a ludicrous and quick way is beyond words - really. The other factor in fast resolution was how Michael Myers remained alive. What a bunch of garbage, switching place with a paramedic? What?absurdity.

Why cant someone in Hollywood find one that is suitable?John Carpenter must be laughing at what they have done to his original masterpiece. Exploited and twisted his creation into a money cow for profit and a level of low entertainment. And Jamie Lee Curtis surprised me the most with her performance in this film.

Disney has been largely successful with that format in the past, and they seem to be diverging from it.  They brought us the hilarious antics in `The Emperor's New Groove' which was furthest from that format.  Now they bring us another break from the pack, `Lilo & Stitch'.&#145;Experiment 6-2-6' was designed by an alien race to be a super-soldier of sorts.  An artificial life deemed to be unsafe it is condemned to imprisonment.  However, it's clever enough to elude its captors, escapes, and crash-lands on Earth.  The landing target is, of all places, Hawaii where it is adopted by a young girl named Lilo (pronounced &#145;LEE-lo').  She is unaware of the creature's origins, mistakes it for a strange dog, and names him `Stitch'.  The story follows Lilo and Stitch (hence the title) as Lilo struggles with her broken family life (being raised by only her older sister), and Stitch adapts to life on Earth, while attempting to avoid capture by the society from which he escaped.  I found this film to be as entertaining to me, as the children in the theatre found it. The relationships in this movie are those that children can relate with.  Stitch's adapting to life in Hawaii is one that comes off quite comical, and routinely unexpected.  His social skills are lacking, and he reacts quickly, without thought, which is the source for the comedy.  I found myself laughing out loud at several of Stitch's antics, and his overall character behaviour really doesn't grow tiring.The movie does take an emotional side too as Lilo confronts her broken home and grows attached to Stitch, who ultimately is threatened with his own capture.  Although it could have gotten completely sappy at the end, it doesn't, which is refreshing.  Of course, it is a Disney feature, so a happy ending is always expected, but it's a light one&#133; complementing the light-hearted romp of this movie.Granted, it's not Disney's platinum achievements, nor is it an AMAZING story&#133; but given the low-key promotion this movie has had, it might slip by you un-detected.

Disney has been largely successful with that format in the past, and they seem to be diverging from it.  They brought us the hilarious antics in `The Emperor's New Groove' which was furthest from that format.  Now they bring us another break from the pack, `Lilo & Stitch'.&#145;Experiment 6-2-6' was designed by an alien race to be a super-soldier of sorts.  An artificial life deemed to be unsafe it is condemned to imprisonment.  However, it's clever enough to elude its captors, escapes, and crash-lands on Earth.  The landing target is, of all places, Hawaii where it is adopted by a young girl named Lilo (pronounced &#145;LEE-lo').  She is unaware of the creature's origins, mistakes it for a strange dog, and names him `Stitch'.  The story follows Lilo and Stitch (hence the title) as Lilo struggles with her broken family life (being raised by only her older sister), and Stitch adapts to life on Earth, while attempting to avoid capture by the society from which he escaped.  I found this film to be as entertaining to me, as the children in the theatre found it. The relationships in this movie are those that children can relate with.  Stitch's adapting to life in Hawaii is one that comes off quite comical, and routinely unexpected.  His social skills are lacking, and he reacts quickly, without thought, which is the source for the comedy.  I found myself laughing out loud at several of Stitch's antics, and his overall character behaviour really doesn't grow tiring.The movie does take an emotional side too as Lilo confronts her broken home and grows attached to Stitch, who ultimately is threatened with his own capture.  Although it could have gotten completely sappy at the end, it doesn't, which is refreshing.  Of course, it is a Disney feature, so a happy ending is always expected, but it's a light one&#133; complementing the light-hearted romp of this movie.Granted, it's not Disney's platinum achievements, nor is it an AMAZING story&#133; but given the low-key promotion this movie has had, it might slip by you un-detected.

The long-waited 7th sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 classic about an escaped mental patient searching for his sister on Halloween night. Over the past 10 years I have watched the series grow from a simple indie horror flick to a complex epic horror story. For me, Halloween was the perfect horror film series from I & II to 4-6. Then in 1998 came Halloween Twenty Years Later(I choose not to acknowledge that ridiculous H20 part), a decent yet disappointing sequel that broke the continuing storyline we had and tried to get us to believe that 4-6 didn't happen.That doesn't mean that things couldn't be fixed in a later sequel, so I had hope for 8. From 1999-2001 Dimension put the film together and several different ideas came across and then were dropped or debunked as rumor. Finally on July 12, 2002 it hit theatres. Today me, my dad, and two of my friends went in to see this film. I was really excited especially after having seen the cool trailers many times. Now here it, my review of Rick Rosenthal's Halloween Resurrection...!!!POSSIBLE SPOILER OR 2!!!Plot3 Years have passed since Laurie Strode decapitated the man whom she thought was her brother, infamous serial killer Michael Myers. Turns out Myers switched clothes with a paramedic, crushed his windpipe, and left. Laurie was locked up in a sanitarium and now Michael has found her. After finally ridding himself of his sister, he returns to Haddonfield, Illinois to kill off any other surviving relatives. However, he learns that 8 people are locked up in his house holding a live webcast. There they will search for clues as to why Myers does what he does. Michael doesn't like this idea, so he locks himself in with these people and kills them one by one.The goodA pretty good pace through most of the film. Jamie Lee Curtis, Bianca Kajilch, Brad Loree, and Ryan Merriman give good performances. The whole webcast things is pulled off really well, so the story is pretty good. We also get some great kill scenes, and a great dark atmosphere to go along with all of it. Not to mention a pretty good score.The badAside from the actors I mentioned above, the rest of the cast is forgettable and I could care less about them. The pace does lag at times, but not for a big part of the movie. There is no character development or suspense whatsoever. That's not te worst thing about it though. The #1 one bad hing about this film is that like H20 it tries to get us to believe that 4-6 never happened, but it doesn't completely erase them eighther. Oh and two more things What's with the connection between Sara and Miles? It doesn't go anywhere and is not needed. Finally we get a lame explanation for why Michael was supposedly missing for 20 years, but I won't spoil that one for you.OverallDespite it's flaws, Resurrection is a pretty good addition to the Halloween series, but is still nowhere near as good as parts 1-6.***1\/2 out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"13 July 2002","score":"","review":"  Well here it is.

When you see this movie, a comfortable chair is essential, because it is enchanting and you will not want to move and your buttocks may well get sore before the end.This film is not above criticism from Tolkien diehards, but it is a remarkable visual experience.  The acting was not perfect, yet so complete was my suspension of disbelief that I seldom felt like it was poor acting by anyone other than the *characters* in the story. (Why, Pippen, what a strange thing to say...) Some may complain that this section or that section was omitted, or the film sacrificed one minor character to build up another, or there were too many ring shots, or whatever.  IMHO, these are ultimately little more than nitpicks.Anyone who read the book has to admit that turning it into a screenplay is a tough job.  For all that was omitted, IT WAS STILL 3 HOURS LONG. What's a humble script writer going to do, release it as a 6-hour movie to fit in Old Man Willow and Tom Bombadil and Goldberry and Fatty Bolger and the house in Crickhollow and Farmer Maggot and the barrow wights?  No, this is about as good a job as one can do with the story as a movie script and still have a movie.  Tolkien's books do not jump easily onto the movie screen; many have tried, so far only this one has succeeded.The level of detail in set and costume design is beyond compare.  I have never seen anything like it before, and outside this trilogy I don't expect to see it again.  New Zealand provides a wonderful backdrop for the film, it is Middle Earth as far as I can tell.  One really feels the age and stagnation of the elvish culture, the ruin of the Numenorean civilization, the pastoral provincialism of the hobbits, the lost glory of the greedy dwarves, and the tension between various races.  The elves are not presented as benevolent fairy-godmother types, which is refreshing. Galadriel was a presence that defied description, although the aural effect on her voice made some of her speech difficult to grok. The size differences are expressed rather well, one seldom doubts that Elijah Wood is three feet shorter than Ian McClellan.Nothing in this film is so poor as to merit serious complaint, and much is done exquisitely.  For all her a priori shortcomings as an actress, Liv Tyler does speak elvish passingly well, with subtitles, and Arwen's altered, expanded role is welcome.  Her romance with Aragorn is done briefly, as is to be expected when the goal was moving the plot along, but not quite as cursorily as some reviewers here have suggested.  It will be interesting to see how the conflicted passion of Eowyn is used by the script in the upcoming sequel.Oh, yes, that brings me to the trailer for The Two Towers attached to the end of the film.  Those who longed for more epic battle scenes will be more than satisfied with the next two movies, I'd wager.  It looks every bit as beautiful a film as this one, and will likely omit just as much and be just as long and be nominated for at least as many awards.I voted this film an 8\/10, downgraded only for my own minor nits with a few coarse edits, somewhat undercooked acting, and occasional sloppy dialog. My only moment of disconnect from the fantasy occurs when Hugo Weaving talks, as I keep expecting Agent Smith from The Matrix. Welcome to Rivendell, Mr. Anderson.
