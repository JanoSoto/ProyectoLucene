Unfortunately, they'd all have to settle for this one, with the comforting thought of knowing that worse movies in and about high school do exist.For the record, Eve Tingle *is* a bitch, whether she's right or wrong about a subject. Even some of the stuffiest teachers on screen(the Prof. Kingsfield's, Mr. Hand's and Mr. Feeny's) and in real-life actually want their pupils to benefit from their lessons. Not this lady. She honestly feels she's better than everyone(including her fellow faculty members) and wants them to stay at the bottom of the totem pole. I can't say I would've kidnapped a teacher over something as trivial as my grades if I were still in high school, but there are teachers I would've given some sort of retribution for their exploitation of youth. The kids in this movie are incredibly stupid! They should have known how easily Mrs. Tingle is at manipulating people in ways that we've seen so many times it's beneath cliche. You'd think that even the budding actress played by Marisa Coughlin would be able to detect Tingle's act, but she doesn't. She talks them into everything, even getting two of them to have a sexual tryst in order to distract them from keeping an eye on her. I would've seen her b.s. coming a mile away even if I were younger than those kids were supposed to be. Too bad they were too stupid to see this coming, but at least Katie Holmes and Barry Watson got to enjoy themselves.Then of course, there's Molly Ringwald who plays the secretary turned substitute teacher Miss Banks, a role mistakenly described by some as a cameo role. People who expected her to remain the John Hughes teen heroine had better brace themselves for a shock when they find out she plays a caring and responsible adult. And it's because she's such an adult that even though she hates Mrs. Tingle like everyone else, she knows something's up later on in the movie.One important point; nobody dies. Not the kids, not the teachers, not the cops and certainly not the villainess. The horror fans this movie is supposed to appeal to will be disappointed with that, but then again there's plenty of other elements that'd bring the same reaction. This may be an fairly interesting story, but that's the only positive thing you can expect from it. ","genre":null},{"date":"31 March 2003","score":"","review":"  (*WARNING!

Even to a 19-year-old male college student, this movie has touched me more than any other.*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS HERE*I will keep my comments brief.  About a year ago, my friends and I sat down to watch the movie that all the critics were talking about, A.I.  It was on this day that one of our close friend's mother died.  We were all deeply upset, but decided to get together anyway and watch a movie to ease our minds.  The movie is about a Mechanical (Mecha) boy named David who is the first of his kind to be programmed to love.  Even as he is deserted by his mother and father and narrowly escapes trouble that could have been prevented, he still has that unconditional love only a child can have for his mother.  Upon being left in the woods alone, David begins his search to find his mother and feel the love he once had.  The search lasts nearly thousands of years....as he is frozen in an icy ocean praying to see his mother again.  Having no concept of time, David wakes up during a futuristic time when friendly aliens roam the earth.  They offer him anything he wishes because they only want for him to be happy.  Of course his only wish is to be with his mother, but he is told he cannot because she has been dead for many years.(I won't spoil why he is able to finally see his mother, but he is told that he will only be allowed to see her for one day.) When the day is over, she will die.  David, wanting nothing more than his mother, requests his wish and it is granted.  The ending, as David spends a final day with his only true love, is extremely sad(trust me, four 18-year-old guys cried during this).  Finally, he hears the words he's been waiting for I love you from his mother and as she dies, he is able to finally go to the place where dreams are born.It is the love of a small child that makes this movie so sad in the end. I loved this movie because it really shows (although slightly exaggerated) what true love really is.  Because of our experience, we all have a deep connection with this movie.  I realize it goes on forever, but it was a great idea and a touching end to one of the greatest directors of all time. Thank you Mr. Kubrick.

It's about Manny Singer who's wife has just passed away and his 7-year-old daughter Molly has trouble adjusting to life without her mother around. Molly uses the silent treatment around Manny and a couple of nannies since she is having trouble coping. One day a very friendly black woman named Corrina Washington comes by and decides to be Molly's nanny since she's good with children as she puts it. Molly soon gets to like Corrina and comes out of her silent mood, but is still dismayed by her mother's death. Corrina teaches the youngster everything-how to clean floors and valuables, how to hula-hoop, and how to play the piano. Manny soon realizes that he's practically in love with Corrina when they sit outside on a soft chair together. Trouble soon arises when Manny receives a phone call at work saying that Corinna has not been taking Molly to school everyday. Manny is mad at both Corinna and Molly for lying to him and he fires Corinna as Molly's nanny but soon re-hires her when Molly insists that Corinna is to come back.

The film is richer for the brilliant casting of Palance's voice.I was viewing the movie with my daughter and my reasons for enjoying the film were the brilliant lines spoken by the male characters that could have been from one of those film-noir gangster films of the Fifties. The turtle character reminded me of Peter Lorre's voice. Take some of the lines Once you steal something, you spend your whole life fighting to keep it, or You should write a book How to Offend Women in Five Syllables or Less. These are lines that adults will love not kids.The dialogue  Don't let her die!  Is that a threat?  Don't you dare let her die!  Oh, it is a threat could have been straight out of a modern gangster film..The lines\/dialogues, not the screenplay, are top notch.

Cameron Diaz has definitely done a fine job as an actress in the many films she has acted.Christina(Cameron Diaz), Courtney(Christina Applegate), and Jane(Selma Blair) are all single women who love to play with the minds of the men they meet during their active night life.  One night out, Christina meets Peter, and he tells her a truthful piece of his mind. They later meet again to start over and get to know each other.

Christina has the desire to find the man again and tell him how she feels.  Courtney finds out where the wedding is being held, and they venture off only to come back upset and disgusted when they find out why cops are all over Christina's apartment.  Peter comes to find Christina, because he can not stop thinking about her.  It was love at first sight, and they did not even know it.Roger Kumble,the director, had to add comedy to this love story so that it would be more appealing to the audience.

I was always seeing it at blockbuster, but never rented it because I thought it would be hokie and dumb. Bruce Willis in a movie about a guy who gets visited by his kid self, come on! Boy was I wrong. This movie surprised me in more ways than one. First I would like to say it was really funny and heart-warming. Bruce Willis can deliver comedic lines very well. He has proven he is a dynamic and versatile actor in the last few years.  He can do drama like Unbreakable, suspense like the Sixth Sense, and comedy. The kid who plays him at 8 years old is also very good and likeable. Lily Tomlin is great as Bruce Willis' personal assistant. She injects a lot of humor to the story and interacts very well with Willis' character. The movie is not just for kids as you quickly find out in the first 15 minutes. It is a story for anybody of any age. The message that you can be what you want in life is very profound throughout the film. It illustrates to the audience how your life can turn out differently depending on the choices you make along the way. I also liked how the movie told us how life is a journey that can go in many directions. A person just has to make things happen and go for what makes them happy.The bond and relationship that forms between present day Willis and his kid self is very sweet and endearing. Willis learns to forgive and accept who he was as a kid in order to better understand who he is as an adult. He learns and grows throughout the film and reaches a point of happiness and satisfaction that leads him to realize his life is not so bad.I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a feel-good comedy that entertains and makes you think of life's possibilities.

Dracula is a suductive, spooky, and devilish little thriller. It's dry at some scenes but good at others. If you don't like the scenes when Dracula tries to bite Mena's throat, then your not a vampire fan. The movie is bloodless but, thats ok because Dracula needs to saver every drop of blood. I love his words too I vant to suck your blood, Come to me, You have strong veins, I am Dracula. Good stuff. My Take 10\/10 My MPAA Rating PG for some vampire scariness.
