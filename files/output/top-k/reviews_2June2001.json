This movie has no plot whatsoever,nought, nowt, not a lot. Zilch, thats the Big O. If you like your movies to hang together and have deep, complex and meaningfulplots, and don't like it any other way, then you may as well go and get out a video, because you will utterly loathe the Mummy Returns.If however, you enjoy a good, fun film, to be watched with brain switched off, bucket of popcorn, and several mates, and you like a good laugh, then this is for you.This is a Wild, Wild ride. This is Indiana Jones written large, with more humour and a few twists. This is the 1930's equivalent of Steampunk, with the rocket-airship and all the gun-play, as well as all the magic and mayhem that goes on. It's a fascinating kind of style really,and one which I'd like to see movies use in the future (albeit maybe with more plot @) ).So, right from the first scenes, where they find the bracelet, you realise this sequel is going to at once pay homage to its predecessor, and send you out on some new thrills along the way. You know how it works. Find artefact, make bad quote, accidently unleash ancient evil, race against time to fix it. The Kid is funny, he just has this habit of being incredibly sarcastic at the most inappropriate moments, which is hilarious when you see the reactions he gets. Brendan has made this style his own, and he does the hero schtick very well, fighting, shooting, quipping and complaining his way through the film. Rachel gets to kick ass some more in this film. Lara Croft has nothing on this girl, lets be honest (its the tight black that does it for me). John Hannah plays Jonathan with that usual bumbling Englishness that he did so well in the first film. Arnold Vosloo is as scary as all hell as Imhotep, although I would have liked to have seen some of his other powers. The other players turn in excellent and amusing performances too. The Rock even gets to do his famous eyebrow!The whole film is just one huge, fun, wild romp through fantasyland from beginning to end. I even liked the music, and the Live song at the end of the credits (Forever may not be long enough) was a good counterpoint to the rest of the film.I thoroughly enjoyed this. I think you will too.

Young poet Christian (Ewan McGregor) comes to Paris in hopes to find inspiration for his writing and inspiration for love. While in Paris, he meets four strange characters who decide to try to get him to be the head writer of a play being worked on called Spectacular Spectacular, to be shown at the ever famous night club Moulin Rouge. So these men take Christian there and arrange a meeting between Christian and Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star dancer of the club and aspiring actress who longs for a better life than being a dancing hooker (well, who wouldn't?). However, the arrangement was made by deceivement-Satine was supposed to meet with The Duke (Richard Roxburgh), who wants to turn the night club into a theater and who also lusts for Satine. Anyway, during the meeting between Christian and Satine, Christian falls in love with Satine and although she's afraid to admit it, she falls in love with him too. But this love is forbidden-see, Satine is forbidden by Moulin Rouge's owner to ever fall in love. And also, The Duke wants Satine to himself. All of these facts cause Christian and Satine's romance to must be a secret. So basically, the movie follows the story of their romance and the construction of the play for Moulin Rouge.This movie was beautiful. Baz Luhrman worked excellently with this film. The cinematic work was breathtaking-even the opening 20th Century Fox fanfare was creative, what with an orchestra leader leading the players of the fanfare. Great! And the symbolism of just how great Moulin Rouge seemed was excellent-outside of the club, it was dreary, gray, and dark. But inside it was bright and colorful.

I enjoyed this movie a lot. I really liked it. I rented this and watched it and at the end credits all I could say was wow. If you like comedys\/ horror films such as Scary Movie you should like this one. It doesn't seem like a funny movie from the cover with the big alligator's mouth wide open, but it has it's share of comedy. Bill Pullman, Briget Fonda, and Oliver Platt had a good role in this film. If you like Scary Movie you'll probably like this one. I can't give this movie an A, but I give it a B+! I reccomend it.

I realize this is a contradiction, but what wasn't about this film? Outside of My Fair Lady I have never been able to stomach a musical, so when I went to see Moulin Rouge I was expecting to go to laugh at it. Strangely enough, I consistently found myself laughing with the film rather than at it (as well as crying). Every time a new scene emerged I thought, here's my chance to scoff, but the film was able to pull me into the other direction EVERY TIME. If anyone wants to know what Post Modern is this is it.  This film took pop culture and made it art...how is that possible? I'm still trying to figure it out.The film, first of all, cannibalizes itself. It's a story about a man writing a play based on the story as it unfolds, and he is writing out the story after the fact. So it's a story within a story within a story. But it is never confusing, surprisingly enough.  Secondly, there is a romance. How does one make a movie about a romance of this nature--very cliche--and pull it off? Ask the director and writer of the film and you'll find out.  I still can't believe I liked the romantic aspect, but I did. Thirdly, the film is a mixture of genres I haven't seen since Blade Runner (although I wouldn't compare the two)--a musical, comedy, tragedy, fairy tale, with some hints of film noir. Fourthly, the film, I don't think, has any original score; rather, it uses a mixture of music from the last thirty years--some so unlikely to be put together that one has to check themselves to make sure they are really hearing the song(s) they are hearing. What I find interesting about the score is that Kidman can sing Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend while the men below sing Smells Like Teen Spirit, both in their original tunes, and they work together as if it was all the same song. And fifthly, the movie is obviously a parody of musicals (and parodies are almost impossible to pull of these days without being banal), which is why the mixture of music, the love story, etc. can be well received without indignant guffaws.Well, there were a couple of people who did guffaw and snicker...but they were sixteen year-old teenage girls with their boyfriends who went to go see the movie because of the Madame Marmalade video on MTV--they wouldn't know parody if Christina Aguilara told them personally. And many have been asking if McGregor and Kidman were lip syncing. Actually, no. Everyone in the film sang their own music and did it live (of course, I'm sure there was some fiddling around with the sound quality).Anyone with intelligence could see Moulin Rouge for what it is a great film. Over the top? Yes. Silly? Yes. Contradictory? Yes. But strangely enough, it all works because it knows it is all of those things and plays off of them. I walked out of that movie thoroughly surprised at my respect for it. It was worth every dollar I spent and I'll spend it again.
