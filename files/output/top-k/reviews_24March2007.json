It was so over the top with gore and filled with stupid humor that I almost didn't recommend it. But after watching it I saw that it was intentionally created with this type of humor in mind. Peter Jackson (yeah that Lord of The Rings guy)went above and beyond just a horror film and made one of the most hilarious gore comedy's of all time.Lionel,(Timothy Balme) an innocent young man, has to take care of his domineering mother after she is bitten by the infamous Sumatran rat monkey. After her death she comes back and starts eating people, infecting them and turning them into what she has become, a zombie that craves human flesh and blood. Like herself, these new zombies are able to infect other people that they dine on, and soon Lionel finds the task of trying to keep them all under lock and key in the basement impossible.This movie was way over the top in humor and gore. The gore becomes more outrageous as the movie goes on, and I found myself laughing hysterically at the special effects and the gruesome scenes. This is not a horror film per-say, it is more like a gruesome comedy which has more gross out scenes than any other movie I've ever seen. The movie includes a Kung Fu priest and even a baby zombie monster which was conceived by two zombies having sex. It all culminates into one of the weirdest endings of all time involving a lawnmower and a monstrous zombie.This movie is just to funny to be taken as a true horror film. It is definitely the goriest film I've ever seen, but I was to busy laughing to really be frightened by everything. But I can see why some people might vomit when seeing this film. So be warned if you have a weak stomach. This movie is definitely not for you. However, for anybody else who enjoys over the top comedy served with grisly horror, well this movie might be right up your alley.

It is a slapstick piece and you never stop getting the gags thrown at you throughout it's 3 hours.... Now I'll admit that it is somewhat funny a lot of the time, but that's because you have some of the greatest comedians in the early years of audio\/visual entertainment. Several of them were around before televisions existed. And these were the early years. Most older people from that time period remembered the days of no television and many of them still had no TV. Some of the slapstick humor in this movie was new to a lot of people, even though much of it came from the silent movie era. But, that was because not that many people had seen a decent number of silent movies. In any case, these comedians were able to take a simplistic script and shape it in a funny way. I never laughed really hard during this movie though, because the jokes are not new (even back then) and it takes too long to get to the point on most of them. Also, certain gags are stretched for way too long. Now it's fun to watch certain scenes, like the airplane flying (which is one of the most impressive flight scenes ever), but it's just not really funny. Dick Shaun is funny no matter what he's doing. As far as I know, he was a 'one-trick-pony', but he's hilarious to watch. Actually, most of the comedians had their plus sides, but the script limited them greatly. The cameos are a nice part of the movie, but that's about it. The movie is just way too long. I grew up in Southern California and I love to see the scenery of the desert and the ocean highways, the towns, and the buildings (so much is not shown in movies these days because of release forms that need to be signed). But there's no deep characterization or plot structure in this movie. That's one part of this work that makes 3 hours a damn long time. Of course, how can you develop a character from a plot that can be described in a few words, Dying man tells where to get lots of money. Everybody's greedy side comes out - in a funny sort of way. What I can say that's good about this movie, is that many of the scenes have their funny little moments. But, as I've read from other reviewers here, almost everything is quite predictable. The moral lesson at the end of the movie actually hurts it considerably. I can think (as many people could) of many other possible ways to build to a climax that could make this movie infinitely better. One of these ways is definitely to shorten the movie. I would say that this is kind of like a SNL show. It has some skits that are funny, but there's not a real story that connects them.

The problem with reviewing Die Hard 2 is if any channel anywhere in Cable land decides to air a Die Hard film...it's this one...I've see Die Hard 2 so many times that it hurts...I always seem to catch the same parts and the same lines on TV over and over again despite the fact that Cable TV attempts to bleep out the language with hilarious voice overs such as Yippee Kai eh Mister Falcon---TBS So I watched Die Hard 2 again beginning to end for this review and I must say the film truly is great in it's own right. I mean plugged up against the magnificence of the Die Hard original...it pales in the shadow but nonetheless has some really important features that make it a necessary and worthy sequel to greatness. Director Renny Harlin took over from the unmatchable greatness of John McTiernan and Harlin was the perfect pick because his career and films, much like McTiernan has had greatness and not so great. Harlin seemed to know the characters and story and what was necessary to create the brilliance of another Die Hard film. Still there was a different and distinctive style in Harlin's film over the original. The sarcasm and biting humor was toned down a great deal and the supporting cast wasn't nearly as important as John McClane and the terrorists but setting the film in an airport was sheer brilliance. The most important thing was not lacking and that was unstoppable, kick ass, edge of your seat, things blowing up ACTION!! Bruce Willis returned to his familiar role as tough, rugged, ripped good guy cop John McClane waiting for his now reconciled wife Holly to land in Washington and join him and their kids at her parents home. John with instincts in tact smells something funny going down and everything from there on in is typical Die Hard. Bruce Willis is still amazing in this role and although I don't think the second installment had near the bite and brawn of John McClane that the original had he's still amazing at it and a true action hero further implementing that modern day action cowboy name. Bonnie Bedelia also returns as McClane's once estranged wife that pulled him into the first terrorist plot. Much the same as last time Holly is at the whim of terrorists only this time she is in a jet circling the airport the terrorists have taken control of. Bedelia still has that very strong female role down pat and she suits the idea of a woman who can handle McClane. She also has the pleasure of verbally torturing slimy News anchor Richard Thornburg who happens on the same plane as her played by William Atherton also returning from the original. He gets more of a substantial role and is even more slimy and the perfect adversary for Holly who makes short work of him. William Sadler is terrific as the lead terrorist Col. Stuart although he still doesn't hold a candle to previous lead terrorist in Die Hard played by Alan Rickman but he does a decent job as a man determined to achieve his goal. He's military, decisive, violent, and determined like any great terrorist in films. Franco Nero is also good as the major drug dealer the terrorists are negotiating to have released and escape. Add in the cameo and supporting roles by Reginald VelJohnson, John Amos, Dennis Franz, and Art Evans as McClane's newest sidekick and you've got a great cast.Most importantly the action is swinging within ten minutes of the film's beginning. A gunfight in the baggage claim, suddenly terrorists have control of the flight towers, then they are crashing a 747 filled with people yards from John McClane who is dropping to his knees in terror, a snowmobile chase across an icy lake with machine guns blazing, a high speed Jet chase and finally an unbelievable explosion that is still one of the great explosion scenes in film history. Die Hard 2 lives up to it's name sake and certainly does not disappoint in any fashion. It might not have quite the same wallop that the original had but it also doesn't take away from the series but whole heartedly adds a new chapter that is more than welcome.

Bonnie Bedelia also returns as McClane's once estranged wife that pulled him into the first terrorist plot. Much the same as last time Holly is at the whim of terrorists only this time she is in a jet circling the airport the terrorists have taken control of. Bedelia still has that very strong female role down pat and she suits the idea of a woman who can handle McClane. She also has the pleasure of verbally torturing slimy News anchor Richard Thornburg who happens on the same plane as her played by William Atherton also returning from the original. He gets more of a substantial role and is even more slimy and the perfect adversary for Holly who makes short work of him. William Sadler is terrific as the lead terrorist Col. Stuart although he still doesn't hold a candle to previous lead terrorist in Die Hard played by Alan Rickman but he does a decent job as a man determined to achieve his goal. He's military, decisive, violent, and determined like any great terrorist in films. Franco Nero is also good as the major drug dealer the terrorists are negotiating to have released and escape. Add in the cameo and supporting roles by Reginald VelJohnson, John Amos, Dennis Franz, and Art Evans as McClane's newest sidekick and you've got a great cast.Most importantly the action is swinging within ten minutes of the film's beginning. A gunfight in the baggage claim, suddenly terrorists have control of the flight towers, then they are crashing a 747 filled with people yards from John McClane who is dropping to his knees in terror, a snowmobile chase across an icy lake with machine guns blazing, a high speed Jet chase and finally an unbelievable explosion that is still one of the great explosion scenes in film history. Die Hard 2 lives up to it's name sake and certainly does not disappoint in any fashion. It might not have quite the same wallop that the original had but it also doesn't take away from the series but whole heartedly adds a new chapter that is more than welcome.

The problem with reviewing Die Hard 2 is if any channel anywhere in Cable land decides to air a Die Hard film...it's this one...I've see Die Hard 2 so many times that it hurts...I always seem to catch the same parts and the same lines on TV over and over again despite the fact that Cable TV attempts to bleep out the language with hilarious voice overs such as Yippee Kai eh Mister Falcon---TBS So I watched Die Hard 2 again beginning to end for this review and I must say the film truly is great in it's own right. I mean plugged up against the magnificence of the Die Hard original...it pales in the shadow but nonetheless has some really important features that make it a necessary and worthy sequel to greatness. Director Renny Harlin took over from the unmatchable greatness of John McTiernan and Harlin was the perfect pick because his career and films, much like McTiernan has had greatness and not so great. Harlin seemed to know the characters and story and what was necessary to create the brilliance of another Die Hard film. Still there was a different and distinctive style in Harlin's film over the original. The sarcasm and biting humor was toned down a great deal and the supporting cast wasn't nearly as important as John McClane and the terrorists but setting the film in an airport was sheer brilliance. The most important thing was not lacking and that was unstoppable, kick ass, edge of your seat, things blowing up ACTION!! Bruce Willis returned to his familiar role as tough, rugged, ripped good guy cop John McClane waiting for his now reconciled wife Holly to land in Washington and join him and their kids at her parents home. John with instincts in tact smells something funny going down and everything from there on in is typical Die Hard.

I honestly think that this movie is actually WORSE than the third installment in the series. The movie starts off with a pot-smoking army truck driver loosing a few barrels from his truck, and one falling into the river. The story then cuts to a few young boys, two of which are trying to get the youngest to join their club. They go to their clubhouse which turns out to be a crypt. The youngest boy runs away, and goes into a large drainpipe, in which the fallen canister MAGICALLY moved into. The boys open the canister, releasing the ghoul inside. Now, this is where I realized that this movie was going to get worse before it gets better. The ghoul looks like the Tarman from the first film, only not as creepy, a bit more (trying to be) comedic, and with worse make-up and movement. Well, the gas in the canister is released into the air, and in only about 9 seconds, the clear sky gets filled with dark clouds and with a cliché stroke of lightning, it begins to rain. The rain, now with the zombie-gas in it, seeps into the graveyard, and the zombies within start to get out of their graves. Sadly, what was a fairly creepy scene in the first movie is made to be a slapstick comedy scene, with one zombie's hands getting stepped on repeatedly while trying to get out of his grave, and another zombie straightening his tie when he gets out. What insulted me most, though, is that the zombies were no longer the desperate for brains, fast-moving variety which scared us senseless in the first film. No, now they are about as slow moving as those in Night of the Living Dead. Which is a bad thing, as you would know if you were to see the horror of the characters in Part 1 when they discovered that the movie (Night of the Living Dead) lied. Well, the movie continues, and there is a bit more brain eating than the first film, but it's no longer as horrifying as in the first movie. Instead of characters still trying to get away as their brains are eaten, and then twitching while on the ground, they are overcome with surprise (or so I would think) and stop in their tracks. Near the end of the movie, one character is chasing his girlfriend, and when she trips, he comes up to her saying that it's just her, and she says Ok and calms down. Now, here's the clincher He begins to move his mouth towards the top of her head, albeit slowly, and she obviously notices this, and she has this look of grim satisfaction on her face, even after he begins to chomp her skull. You would think having your brains eaten would hurt... The absolute saddest parts of this movie, in my opinion, were the attempts at making a connection with the first movie. Two characters, Joey and Ed, are played by the same actors that played Freddie and Frank respectively in the first film, have a similar relationship as in Part 1. One scene has the characters repeating a joke from the first movie, but with none of the humorFirst film-- Freddie Stupid asshole! Frank Watch your tongue boy, if you like this job! Freddie LIKE THIS JOB?!?!?!This Film-- Joey You're just afraid that some old creep like you is gonna come along and steal your head. Ed Watch your tongue, boy, if you like this job! Joey Like this job? another scene has the characters announcing that they feel like they've done this all before, like in a dream or something.Overall, this movie has cheesy acting, unfunny humor, an odd DOWNGRADE in make-up effects, and no horror to speak of. I can't see why anyone would be able to say this is as good as the first, let alone BETTER than Part 1. I give this film 4 BRAAAAAAAAIIIINSSSS out of 10.P.S. You know how I earlier commented on how I knew the movie would get worse before it got better? Well, it did get worse, but not better.

This is the question that I tackled while watching another cookie be cut from the Hollywood bakery &#150; this time it was called A Walk to Remember. An adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel by the same name, it focuses on the fairy tale blossom of love between quintessential bad boy Landon Carter (played dramatically by Shane West) and bible-thumping, dust in the wind, cliché bookworm Jamie Sullivan (played by first timer Mandy Moore). As always, we begin with Landon's hijinks, followed by consequences which bring Jamie and him together. Sparks fly? Hardly, but they continue to encounter each other, each imposing their lives into one another, and finally &#150; through Hollywood magic fall in love. What happens in the following acts is classic Sparks as tears begin to play a pivotal element in the closing moments. As I mentioned in my review for The Notebook, one cannot help but wonder if the Kleenex corporation doesn't keep Mr. Sparks, or these films, on retainer.I do not mean to be so harsh with my opening, but one needs to realize that this film, to me, felt stale. I, as well as anyone that has ever watched a full length film, have seen all of these elements before. With A Walk to Remember, I was not impressed or surprised. Perhaps a bit jaded knowing what would happen before it did due largely in part to whispers by huge fans of this film, but I walked away from this as I had with other Shankman films. There could have been potential, but instead it suffered from Hollywood similarities, which ultimately left me with quite a bit of Hollywood boredom. Gasp! Did he say that? Yep, I was bored with this film. The lack of humor, the randomness of chance, and the simplicity of the plot left me wanting, desiring, desperately waiting for something imaginative, creative, or unique to happen. Alas, nothing &#150; I repeat &#150; nothing of the sort occurred. From the cliché play, to the reuniting of family, to the forced tear-jerker of an ending, A Walk to Remember proved yet again that one could make film cookies out of the same, overused batch of cookie dough time and time again while consumers will still stumble across the counter to grab. Why is this? Was it the hunky-ness of Shane West, who did provide with at least a glimmer of acting ability (though his tear scenes were hysterical at best)? Was it that we were hoping for something from Mandy Moore, who only proved that speaking in a small voice and wearing pasty make-up will make audiences cry? Personally, I believe the hype surrounding this film arrives from the name Spark, Nicholas Sparks. It was his name that carried this film, and I cannot say that the new translation fit his story well enough to matter.As I watched this film, it was the secondary characters that really attracted my attention. Daryl Hannah must have just signed for this gig mainly for the paycheck, as she looked especially man-ish in her role. I was a bit startled when I saw her at first, then transformed into confusion as I tried to figure out what sort of mother-role she was attempting. The same can be said for Jamie's father, whom in my eyes, carried this film. I wanted more dynamic between her and him, their differences and their personal loss &#150; as only you could find in Sparks' story. He fit the mold of what this film represented. He was a father &#150; one that nearly anyone could relate to. There was Landon's friends, which played out like a horrid 80s film completely filled with sucker punches, unfunny jokes, and that snobbish popular behavior that seems to drench any teen film head to toe. How did Al Thompson get all the jokes for the film ... could anyone else be any funnier? While I appreciated the levity he brought, there wasn't much to the film to make one feel sad. I say this not because of what happened in the final act, but because there wasn't enough emotion brought to the characters for me to be compelled enough to let my tear ducts express themselves.Overall, I cannot suggest this film to anyone except small teens that are not allowed to go to PG-13 films yet. Throughout the commentary (which, subsequently, only addresses the childish nature of the film), Shankman et crew discuss how this was about to be a PG-13 film, but had to be cut &#150; language and nudity &#150; to appeal to a larger audience as well ensure that the religious sect would not abolish this film. Again, I would like to point out that the makers of this piece of cinema do not consider this a religious film, but instead, a film about faith. I didn't see that. Faith was important to Jamie, but as the film closed, that wasn't the topic of thought. Instead, the question of combustible relationships came to mind. I will have to ask you to pass on this film, unless you are in middle school and have never seen a movie before in your life.Don't let your faith flame get too close to this combustible relationship -- A Walk to Remember could be the result.Grade ** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"24 March 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Is love an instantaneous combustion?

Throughout the commentary (which, subsequently, only addresses the childish nature of the film), Shankman et crew discuss how this was about to be a PG-13 film, but had to be cut &#150; language and nudity &#150; to appeal to a larger audience as well ensure that the religious sect would not abolish this film. Again, I would like to point out that the makers of this piece of cinema do not consider this a religious film, but instead, a film about faith. I didn't see that. Faith was important to Jamie, but as the film closed, that wasn't the topic of thought. Instead, the question of combustible relationships came to mind. I will have to ask you to pass on this film, unless you are in middle school and have never seen a movie before in your life.Don't let your faith flame get too close to this combustible relationship -- A Walk to Remember could be the result.Grade ** out of ***** ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"24 March 2007","score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Jim Carrey has only been better than this in two movies, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Man on the Moon, but both were more or less dramatic roles. Aside from the classic Dumb and Dumber, none of his comedy roles can even begin to compare to his superb, electric performance here. Most people I know don't really enjoy this, but that's because they can't really relate, or they don't want to. Carrey plays 'Chip Douglas' (which might be his real name, or it might not), a Cable Guy brought up on TV and movies. His performance works so well because he normally goes too far with his antics, making himself seem annoying on occasion, rather than funny. Here, he plays a lunatic, so there are no limits for him to adhere to, and where he would normally seem over the top (the Medieval Times sequence), he is genuinely hilarious.Now, I might not be a cable guy, but I'd be lying if I said that I don't spew lines from random movies out of nowhere, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't have an obsession. Maybe it makes fellow fanatics a bit unsettled to see themselves compared to maniacs like Chip (which is probably why the critics assaulted this as well). Although this is by and large Carrey's movie, there is no doubt that Matthew Broderick, Jack Black, and Leslie Mann help elevate this film further with excellent performances. Ben Stiller has directed a few other films, but none of them even come close to matching this. He keeps a perfect balance between the dark and the funny, so The Cable Guy doesn't come across as too mean or sadistic. He also shows up in a running gag as a former child star from a cheesy old sitcom who shoots his own brother and goes to court, a trial whose verdict is highly anticipated by pretty much everyone. Owen Wilson has another great cameo as a cocky ass who takes Steven's (Broderick) girlfriend (Mann) on a date and gets assaulted by Chip when he goes to the washroom.I have never seen a movie like The Cable Guy, and chances are you haven't either. This is a great movie and one of my personal favorites. It's important you don't watch this expecting a cheery slapstick comedy.

Indy is sent by Walter Donavan to go to Venice to try to find Indy's estranged father. He disappeared while he was looking for the Holy Grail. Indy is joined by Elsa Schneider. Indy's father named Henry is not there. They then discover that he is in a castle. They find him. Then Elsa and Donavan betray Henry and Indy. They are actually Nazis. The Nazis want the Grail and they tricked Henry and Indy into finding the Grail for them. They escape to Berlin, where they find Henry's diary full of information of where the Grail is.

Their harsh captain and weaselly doctor are forcing them to eat maggoty meat and the crew has had enough. They revolt, killing 7 of the officers including the weaselly doctor. One of their crew is pursued and killed. When they dock at Odessa, they place the dead crew member in a tent on shore. Odessa was already a hotbed of socialist activity and many people come out to see the body. The government freaks out and sends the calvary (mostly unmounted) out to quell the crowd. They open fire and mow down many on the steps. This scene is graphic, exciting and heart-wrenching as we watch women and children get brutally shot by the heartless calvary. The Potemkin leaves and is pursued by warships who mean to bring it back.This movie is like a milk-chocolate Hershey bar. Or an anti Hershey bar since how can an all-American chocolate represent a, albeit brilliant, propaganda film supporting the Bolsheviks. Let me tell you how. When Hershey's developed their milk chocolate in the early 20th century, it was a huge breakthrough for the chocolate retards (the Americans). It became huge and Hershey's got a large contract with the U.S. Military. Soldiers all had Hershey bars in their rations. This helped spread Hershey's popularity and made the American soldiers popular with kids when they entered new cities. In a way, Hershey bars served as American propaganda. For their time, they were great, but compared the excellent European chocolate, Hershey's is waxy and tastes of sour milk. This film was absolutely brilliant for its time, but silent movies are not to many people's taste these days, nor is melodrama, as we've matured and moved on to bigger things. I enjoyed the film, had I seen it in 1927, I would have given it a 9. If someone had produced this film last year, I would give it a 4. Overall, I'm giving it a 7\/10, weighting the historical significance higher than the actual enjoyment of the film on today's terms.http\/\/blog.myspace.com\/locoformovies ","genre":null},{"date":"24 March 2007","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" This Sergei Eisenstein silent classic from 1927 chronicles (and embellishes) the true story of the uprising of the crew of the Battleship Potemkin in 1905.

It's a pure slice of oddball life, the story of a man who got more than likely tucked away into some kind of perfunctory manner by the only things in life with any significance being television and gardening. No more or less. How does one end up living out in the world, however, if this is all there is for the span of a long life? Jerzy Kosinski's idea is to place this fragmented, polite but assuredly clueless fellow where double standards rule the day. He meets a businessman after a limo accident, and by his outward appearance seeming to fit a certain mold he takes him in. The man is connected in his dealings, all the way up to the president, as an adviser. All Chance (Peter Sellers) can do is say what he knows- not only does he not know lies or how to lie, he's been sort of conditioned, in a way, to not fully comprehend good and evil either. But his words carry meaning, somehow, and he becomes a celebrity all the while not really connected to what's going on. Rarely before has detachment and the subtleties of the human condition been this engaging.There are three major factors for this, which is the control of wit and truth in the screenplay by Kosinski, who won't go for the cheapest laughs or too mocking in satirical form, but in the moments of dead-pan exchange and the bluntness of Chance's character. Sellers, of course, is at the very top of his game, and that's a first factor, along with the rest of the excellent cast (MacClaine is maybe at her best, as I've not seen too much that wowed me until now; Douglass gives a compassionate performance that speaks to the issue of illness and the end of existence; Warden is surprisingly adept at playing a flabbergasted, weak-willed president). He leads it as if going for something that seems like it shouldn't be interesting. It's a guy who doesn't really have much expression, aside from some bits of joy, like meeting the president, or in becoming (somewhat) part of MacClaine's character's love-life, or in seeing someone die. But even then it's a muted, half-way expression, and the repression that Sellers makes real here is staggering. The term 'comfortably numb' popped in my head once or twice regarding Chance the gardener, and Sellers makes this as real as possible, and sometimes as funny as possible, but for the most part it's his most mature work where there isn't any cheating- what you see, with his mind transmogrified by TV forever- is what you get.Ashby, meanwhile, makes this a very successfully directed film by putting a tone to the picture that is not really like the Chance character because you want to see where he goes next. He'll put in a sequence that is hysterically funny, like when Chance is in the limo watching the Cheech and Chong bit Basketball Jones, or in Chance's reaction to pure sexual advances from MacClaine, or in several little things.

A wealthy man named Charles Foster Kane's last words were Rosebud. A man named Thompson tries to discover what Rosebud meant. Thompson interviews Kane's past friends and family to find out his past life and what Rosebud meant. He discovers what happened in Kane's life, when he was forced to live with a banker for the rest of his life, when he runs his own newspaper, when he marries the President's niece, when he divorces here, when he runs for governor, but fails with a scandal, when he marries his second wife and forces her to be an opera singer, and when his attitude drove the people he loved out of his life. In the end when people burn Kane's possessions one of them is a sled. That sled is called Rosebud.Overall, this is definitely one of the best movies of all time.

The sugar cane juice imparted a subtle, slightly more mellow taste to it than actual sugar, and the ice made sure it was cold and refreshing as I sucked it down. 7.5\/10 http\/\/blog.myspace.com\/locoformovies ","genre":"Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"24 March 2007","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This 1955 heist film follows Tony le Stephanois, recently released from prison for theft, as he undertakes the robbery of his life. He teams up with his old heist buddies and they bring in an expert safe-cracker, Cesar from Milan (played by Jules Dassin, who also directed. He only directed because he had been blacklisted as a communist in the U.S. and couldn't work in Hollywood.) The brilliance of this film is the 1\/2 hour during the robbery. During all this time, there is no dialogue and no music, only the muted sounds of digging through the floor or drilling the safe. This increases the suspense and draws you in. They get away with several hundred million francs worth of jewels, but a jewel offered to a dancer by Cesar brings their haul to the attention of a trio of brutal brothers. They set out to get the stash for themselves and bring misfortune in their wake. Great heist\/gangster movie, but I prefer J.-P.
