[{"date":"13 December 2001","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Shrek is, according to the majority of the IMDB, a far better movie than Pixar's recent Monsters, Inc.Despite this, I still hold out hope for humanity. A spiritless, meagre-plotted exercise in digital imagery, Shrek makes its strength on fart jokes and a throwaway message about inner beauty. The only saving grace Shrek sports is Eddie Murphy's spirited, laugh-out-loud Donkey; unless, of course, you've seen Mulan, in which he made much the same appearance. Then again, I laughed at Mulan as well.Comparisons with Monsters Inc. are inevitable, but nearly impossible to make, given the drastically different drives displayed in each film. Monsters Inc., for its failings, is, like all other Pixar works, plot- and character-driven, concerning itself with a strong story first and digital spectacle second. Shrek is driven by spectacle, with the plot and character development running a distant second. All in all, not worth the $7.50 it cost to see in a theater.
