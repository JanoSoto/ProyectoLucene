This film is pile of american patrotism, some very cool special effects, some very famous faces and some incredibly bad dialouge.  However I think that is all it was ever supposed to be, none of the cast take it seriously in the film and seem to be having a good laugh rather than acting in most scenes.  Why else would the gifted likes of Bushemi, Thornton and Tyler ever appear in a film of this type?  This film has the 'die hard' thing going on, great film to look at, you will gasp, laugh, root for the good guys, cheer when the bad guys (or asteroid) get got, the only thing you won't do is think but that is okay sometimes. Imagine a world where the only movies ever made had the emotional depth of 'the shawshank redemption' or the twist ending of 'the usual suspects' we would all go mad, desperatly searching the earth for a piece of entertainment was mindless and just fun, that's all this movie is...fun.

Her mother's failings placed directly on the child's head; everything the mother went through; every failure, every weakness, blamed on the child. Satan will take you away just like he took your father! Oh, Mama! Everybody KNOWS he left with another woman!The scene where Carrie is dragged into the closet and locked inside by her mother is quite dramatic. It actually looks as though Carrie is being PULLED by her hair! It is also typical of a household in that precarious situation; living on donations made by those who'd rather pay money than listen to the zealot drone on.The effects were quite nice, but the religious connotations of the movie really just bash you in the head until you're in danger of a coma.Other than Sissy (Carrie)'s performance, the acting was stiff, the teenagers were portrayed by people closer to 30 and the movie really wasn't all that.For a compelling and faithful version of this movie, see the Made4TV remake with Angela Bettis. It's a subtly better work! This movie gets a 7.3\/10 from...the Fiend .

Director Bernard Rose overcomes the pitfalls of many biographies of composers,in particular two. Biographies by their very nature are very predictable in structure,Rose overcomes this by using a flashback scructure familiar from Citizen Kane. This makes the film a little confusing at first but really works by the end. The other main flaw with composer biographies is that the music is very rarely used as well as it could be. Here,the music is part of the fabric of the film,with some music repeated like a proper score.It is in the combination of music and image that the film really soars,without the need for dialogue,some might say just as well because the dialogue is sometimes below-par e.g.I forgave him everything be cause of Ode For Joy.One sequence,which depicts Beethoven at the only time,perhaps,when he was truly happy,set to the above-mentioned music,is simly astonishing,but here as elsewhere the power comes from not just the melding of sound and film but also because there is so much emotional investment in the story. By the end,the director has dazzled me with his mastery of the cinema,but also really moved me.Gary Oldman is extraordinary in a role which pretty much runs the gamut of every emotion,you would think the Oscar voters might have at least recognised his performance but it was not to be. At the time of it's release the film was intensely criticised for fabricating too much. These critics missed the point. Bernard Rose has simply offered his own interpretation of the many unanswered questions about Beethoven,using the deep emotions and awesome power of his music as a starting point.Maybe one day this great film will get the appraisal it deserves.

Left to be reared by a wealthy English family after his mother (Joyce Redman, in an Oscar-nominated role) is banished for having him out of wedlock in 18th Century England, Finney grows up to be a wild young man (ala his mother) who loves nothing more than sleeping around with multiple women and taking life as it comes to him. Those around him have enough after a while and banish the youth and it is up to him to find his rightful place in a world that sometimes spits in his face. The one true love of his life (Susannah York), her parents (Oscar nominees Hugh Griffith and Edith Evans) and the seductive Diane Cilento (also with an Oscar nod) are also along for the wild ride. Tom Jones is one of those films that never does make a whole lot of sense really. It is way too uneven to be a complete success, but its unique subject matter for the time period and a crazed screenplay were enough to make it a critical and box office success in 1963. Finney tries to carry the film and does an admirable job at a very young age, but those around him are little more than scenery most of the time. New age Oscar-winning direction by Tony Richardson helps to make the movie better than it should have been. A really over-rated production that somehow overcame better competition to win four Oscars overall. Strangely, the last film President John F. Kennedy saw before his assassination in November of 1963. 4 stars out of 5.
