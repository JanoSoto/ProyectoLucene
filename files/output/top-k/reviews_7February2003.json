International Man of Mystery came straight out of the blue. It was a lone star that few people had heard of. But it was stunningly original, had sophisticated humour and ample humour, always kept in good taste, and had a brilliant cast. The Spy Who Shagged Me was a lot more commercially advertised and hyped about.OK I'll admit, the first time I saw this film I thought it was very funny, but it's only after watching it two or three times that you see all the flaws. The acting was OK, but Heather Graham cannot act. Her performance didn't seem very convincing and she wasn't near as good as Liz Hurley was in the first one. Those characters who bloomed in the first one, (Scott Evil, Number 2 etc.) are thrown into the background hear and don't get many stand-alone scenes. The film is simply overrun with cameos.In particular, I hated the way they totally disregarded some of the scenes in IMOM. When they killed off Vanessa at the start and had Basil sat that he knew she was a fembot all along. What was the point of that? They killed off Number 2 in the first one, and now they bring him back with no explanation whatsoever. This is supposed to be a spy-spoof, I don't think any of the characters even hold a gun in the film. It just goes on a trail, further and further away from the point.The new characters are very unwelcome. The whole Mini-Me `make fun of my size' joke gets old very quickly. Fat Bastard is just a lame excuse for gross-out humour. In total there's about two or three good jokes. The rest are either tasteless or rehashed from IMOM.If this were the first movie of the series then I'd probably be easier on it. But the series started on a note of dry wit and then plummeted down to a level of gross out humour.

I personally love watching his films, just because his enormously unrealistic brand of fighting is both so characteristic of him and also because it's just fun to watch, even if a lot of it is so clearly contrived and totally fake. He's fun to watch in the same goofy way that people like Jackie Chan and Van Damme are fun to watch. It's not real likely that this kind of thing can happen in real life, but it is certainly entertaining nonetheless. However, even this larger than life fighting style can be taken too far. Exit Wounds starts off with a politician reciting enormously disturbing (and TRUE) facts about gun violence in America to a crowd while on his campaign for office. So from the very beginning you know what to expect. If you keep in mind that this is a movie that immediately gets you thinking about how terrible the gun situation in this country is and then turns around and literally kills dozens of people with machine guns within the first three minutes of the film, you know how far the intellectual content is meant to go. This is not only a movie that is not intended to get you thinking, it is specifically a movie that is intended NOT to get you thinking. If you're still thinking about the epidemic of gun violence in America four minutes into the film, you've already missed the point. But the movie makes its first unforgiving mistake here, because this is a point that should NEVER be forgotten.Even Seagal's morbidly entertaining brand of fighting is overdone here and made fake and uninteresting by the efforts to make it look all high tech and fancy, vainly trying to copy Matrix-like slow motion and anti-gravity moves, neither of which do anything but make you sigh and slap your forehead. I can't say that I wasn't at all entertained by the fighting scenes in the film, but there are just some inexcusable things like the scene where Boyd (Seagal) walks out of a court-ordered anger management class (after tearing his desk apart because he got stuck in it) to find a bunch of hoodlums trying to break into his brand new Dodge pickup truck, which still has the factory sticker on the window (this is the only commercial that Dodge apparently could afford to put in the film. Mercedes commercials, on the other hand, filled the rest of the movie). Boyd gets out to his truck and finds, as always, one of those groups of car thieves that are somehow under the impression that it takes the whole gang to break into a single car, and if the owner shows up, it's probably best to stay there and talk to him until he beats the hell out of everyone than to scatter and move on to a different car. Boyd puts his smack down and his whole anger management class runs outside and cheers. The event is a success, because Boyd has made his fellow rage-aholics happy, but as always, he grunts and gets into his truck and speeds away.In fact, probably the only person who looks less happy than Boyd in the film is Latrell Walker, a curious character played surprisingly well by DMX, at least as far as the character that he's given, who is angry and mysterious in a criminal way as long as the screenplay needs him to be, before immediately lightening up and turning into a completely different person so that the movie can have a twist. This is weak screenwriting in its most spectacular form. DMX mumbles his way through the first half of the movie, looking about as happy as your average rapper on the cover of your average rap CD\/magazine\/poster\/movie\/music video\/etc. (spoilers) It turns out that Walker is working undercover to expose a group of corrupt cops and to free his brother from wrongful imprisonment, and neither has a clue in the moon how to do this until the screenplay needs them to. We see a couple scenes of Walker's (or, in this case, Leon Rollins, his un-undercover name) brother talking to Boyd and doing everything he possibly can to convince Boyd and us that he really is a criminal and has a lot to hide. Evidently the weak screenwriting doesn't stop with the character of his brother. Walker\/Rollins is independently wealthy, and the fact that he buys $285,000 cars by tossing a duffel bag full of cash at a salesman and saying, `There's $300,000&#133;Keep the change,' leads you to believe that he is, in fact, involved with the massive amount of drugs that infiltrate the entire film. The later revelation that he runs a freaking WEBSITE called `999.com' (Everything you could want for under a dollar) is probably the weakest bit of screenwriting in the entire movie.Exit Wounds does, in fact, have a good amount of twists in it, and twists are a good way to make a boring movie interesting. But it doesn't throw these twists in at an unexpected moment and therefore get a good reaction from the audience as much as it deliberately misleads us to believe one thing and then completely turns around and throws in all this other stuff to completely cancel out everything that it's said so far. It leads us very carefully by the hand in one direction, and then out of the blue shoves us in the opposite direction. In this case, backwards. This structure is embodied perfectly in a scene late in the film where Boyd and Walker confront each other and start fighting. They fight viciously for a minute or two, and then at the drop of a hat, Walker gets knocked to the ground and says, `You want to see what's really going on? Follow me.' At which point Boyd forgets everything he's ever known about any kind of enemy and casually follows Walker into his own territory, which could be filled with all of his buddies and all of their guns if he hadn't immediately decided that hey, we're friends now. He would never do anything to hurt me.Quality or quantity is a choice that you have to make, and in this case, there is a large quantity of plot twists, none of which have any quality at all. About half way through the film the plot jerks you around so much that by the end you want to just turn off the movie and lay down for a while. Action films are supposed to thrill you, not wear you out by taunting you to try to keep up with the twists. The movie tries to be interesting by piling on all these twists (maybe in an effort to make up for the botched martial arts), but if they really wanted to be interesting they might have thought to try to throw in there somewhere a reason that the movie was called Exit Wounds in the first place, other than to have a hugely unappealing title.

His performances seem too heavy-lidded and self-satisfied, as if rather than being on camera he would prefer to be lounging in his London restaurant, smoking a Bolivar. Like his friend Connery, Caine has created an archetype and founded an entire career on reprising it. A friend of mine bought me the DVD of Get Carter, and I surprised him by saying that I had never seen it before despite its considerable critical and cult reputation.Jack Carter is (as we are constantly reminded) an 'ard lad from the slums of Newcastle who returns home from London to investigate the sudden and mysterious death of his bruvver. Brothers of hard lads obviously just don't die of natural causes, so he hangs around to 'stick his bugle in'.

It has an anti-hero at its centre, realistic settings and a cast of grubby and generally highly avoidable characters. The trouble with this approach is that (as we all know from Hollywood) standards of sex and violence change so quickly that films with little else to offer date badly.

What follows is simply a gratuitous kill-by-numbers plot that tries to pack in the maximum number of gory deaths (by 70s standards) and finally ends with Caine (thankfully) being knocked off himself at his moment of fulfilment.Watching 'Get Carter' does have its scattered pleasures however, not the least of which are the bleak landscapes of Northern England (with accompanying howling wind on the soundtrack), Roy Budd's John Barry-ish score, and a masturbating Britt Ekland. Overall, given the passage of thirty years of ever nastier villains, the film has an almost cosy aspect to its violence that is actually rather endearing, like a cranky but charming old Jag Mark II. Watching it made me think of the Monty Python sketch about the gangster who went around nailing people's heads to the floor.

However, I believe that he was awarded it simply for his entire body (more than forty years?) of work than for this one film in particular.  My Fair Lady on stage ran for over 1,000 performances (a record in its day) and for the majority of the 1950's on Broadway and was Lerner and Loewe's first major triumph (to be followed by Camelot in 1960).  One of the biggest coups of the filming of this musical was the fact that the filmakers were able to secure two out of three of the original New York cast members when shooting the film.  We all know who they left out!  Frankly, I cannot begin to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed My Fair Lady as a film musical (a dying breed by the way) because I really didn't.  Rex Harrison was phenomenal in the role of Professor Henry Higgins just as Yul Brynner was in The King and I.  We are fortunate enough that today we have both of their performances forever captured upon celluloid.  On the other hand, Julie Andrews has become so synonomous with the role of Eliza Doolittle that it basically had to be considered as a smack in the face for her not to be given the role when it transferred over onto film. It isn't that I dislike Audrey Hepburn, I like her alot, but in roles that she originated (like Holly Golightly and Sabrina Fair), not in roles that she assumed after the original had come and gone.  Stanley Holloway does a superb job as Eliza's bum of a father, Alfred P. Doolittle (a role he originated on Broadway as well).  Jeremy Brett brought pathos and heartfelt conviction to the role of Freddy Eynsford-Hill, Eliza's love interest.If anything was wrong with the film itself as a story, the amount of time between each musical number was almost excruciatingly unbearable.   Then, once we got to a musical number, two were usual done back to back, the highlights for me being Wouldn't it be Loverly, I Could Have Danced All Night and of course the perennial favorite love song, On the Street Where You Live.  I assume that Cukor was attempting to make up for lost time.  The overall look of the film was done quite beautifully by Mr. Cecil Beaton (who had also designed the original Broadway production in 1954).  The costuming and settings were exquisite down to the minutest details.  I especially loved the main title sequence with the background of the fresh floral arrangements.Both Harrison and Hepburn were up for Academy Awards for their performances with Harrison winning and Hepburn being beaten by Julie Andrews (of all people) for Walt Disney's Mary Poppins.  Ah yes, I guess revenge can be sweet when done the right way.For a musical comedy of such magnitude and one that defined an era as this one did, I hear that the bidding for the screen rights to this musical were quite high.  After finally seeing this film in one sitting I can't help but ask myself why?  After all, it won eight Academy Awards in 1964 including Best Picture (something that should have gone to Mary Poppins that year if you ask me), but I still can't help but think that only three people deserved them wholeheartedly Cecil Beaton, Rex Harrison and last but definitely not least the late, great George Cukor who with this take on a Broadway Musical Masterpiece finally achieved true Hollywood legendary status!
