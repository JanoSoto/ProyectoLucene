There are some deserving Oscars and there are most that aren't really well known to the general public. But no movie is as beautiful as Road to Perdition. It is one of the most beautiful movies of all time, if not THE most. Why do I love it? Well, I'll tell you right now.What's the story? Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) has a normal wife and two sons but has a dangerous job working as a mob boss for Mr. John Rooney (Paul Newman), who raised him ever since he was a baby and loves him more than his real son Connor (Daniel Craig). One night, Michael's son Michael Jr. (Tyler Hocehlin) witnesses an interrogation by Connor and Michael Sr. Connor then proceeds to shoot the suspect, Finn McGovern. After Michael and his son swore to keep it a secret from each other. Connor sneaks into the Sullivan home and kills Michael's wife and other son while planning to kill Michael Sr. Upset about the event, Michael and his son run away from their hometown and they embark on a cross-country journey to find Connor, the man who killed their family, who has been hidden by his father, all while being pursued by the dead people-loving photographer, Maguire (Jude Law) and learning to bond and work together like father and son.Why I love it1. The characters. One of the underrated trademarks of any director is that they tend to focus their movie on characters. Sam Mendes is one of them. All of his movies are focused more on characters and this film is no exception. The development between Michael and Michael, Jr. is really satisfying. They start out distant from each other, but as the film progresses, they learn to work together and help each other, just like a real father and son. You can feel the emotions between them. They're not one-dimensional stereotypes. They are fully rounded characters who desperately miss & struggle to protect their loved ones while working together to move on and achieve their only goals in life. That's what makes Road to Perdition satisfying. The interplay is the main emotional core of the film. You can watch this film with the sound off and you'll still enjoy the interplay.2. The visuals and music score. They work together like a burger and chips. The cinematography by Conrad Hall (which is his last, sadly. RIP, dude) is beautiful enough. But add the music by the great Thomas Newman and you'll have a film that will almost bring you to tears every second until it all wraps up. It almost feels like an art painting if you decide to play a bit of classical music over it for the next two hours. The framing, the timing of the shots, the volume of the orchestra and the overall tone. When combined together, they're absolutely satisfying. It's the perfect combination. 3. The pacing. The pacing of this movie is perfect. The first 40 minutes set-up the characters and events to come. It is perfectly built and allows the characters to reveal more of their true selves before sending them on their journey. The more we get to know Mr. Rooney and his son & Michael's family, the more I become emotionally invested with these people. I know that less means more, but it's my opinion. 4. The overall direction, performances and writing. Sam Mendes' famous movies are American Beauty and Skyfall. I don't hate these movies. I like them, but what makes this movie superior to the former two is the direction. The decisions he makes along with his actors, cinematographer Conrad Hall and screenwriter David Self such as giving more life to the characters and making it look like an art painting are absolutely well-picked. Mendes knows what he's doing, but he doesn't have a big ego and never gets in the way of his actors, cinematographer and screenwriter. That's what I love about him. The fact that you can do these films as long as you keep out of other people's way. He gives out the best direction I've ever seen. The performances of the actors are also the best, specifically Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law and Tyler Hoechlin. The four have chemistry to work with and their personalities progress throughout the movie without breaking their consistency.UPDATE I recently watched it again in black and white. Now, this was for an experiment to see if colour movies were better in black and white. In the B&W version, I personally got the symbolism and what the characters (such as Michael Sr. and Mr. Rooney) are thinking before they make their decision. The colour is stripped off and reveals the raw emotion inside. But, on the visual style, it gives the film a 1940's film noir feel. At times, it works. Not to say that B&W is better than colour, But I like how it's done in B&W. It makes it more darker and more raw. You know, I wonder if Mendes and Hall thought about shooting the movie in B&W. But I guess they had a reason to shoot in colour. If you want, you could try it out in B&W. Some may prefer it in Colour, but I like both versions. Colour may have beautiful visuals but B&W makes the story more personal and raw. Either way, take your pick on which is the best. Overall, a beautiful, beautiful movie with fully relatable characters, wonderful cinematography and music, a poignant story and a moving message to end it all. It's a beautiful and emotional film which is sure to provoke father's and son's thoughts and pull their heartstrings and is a breath-taking journey well worth taking on.

It is incredibly consistent in quality with its excellent writing, voice-acting, animation and music (really powerful and gorgeous). New characters were created (Harley Quinn), deeper back- stories were developed (Mr. Freeze) and countless other ideas were first seen in this series to later become an integral part of the Batman mythology. Its tone found a perfect midpoint between the darkness usually associated with Batman and a children's action cartoon; both adults and kids can enjoy it. And this feature film lives up to all of those standards in a very satisfying way.There are many twists and turns in the plot of Batman Mask of the Phantasm. Like The Usual Suspects, you'll probably think you're clever for guessing certain things only to find you were way off the mark. The story is original although the Phantasm is apparently based on the Reaper from Batman Year Two. There are many flashbacks that give insight into Bruce's personal evolution and struggle as Batman. They tie-in to the events of the movie naturally.There are many little moments of humour, especially between Alfred and Bruce (or when Bruce is in public with his playboy persona). Their banter is often understated and hilarious. It's not based on shallow gags but centred on the characters so it has a long-term resonance. The more you see of them, the stronger and more entertaining their relationship becomes.The action is really well done. It's not just the same every time, there's always creativity like in a James Bond or Jackie Chan movie. Batman might have to avoid the police while also chasing a suspect or grab and use an unexpected weapon or dodge bombs thrown at him or have to create an impromptu distraction, etc. All the same, he still manages to constantly beat up thugs and outsmart his opponents. And of course, he always has to find a way to fight without ever killing anyone, his most fundamental rule.Speaking of which, the film-makers are clearly passionate about Batman and all of the mythology and fiction that's been created over the years about him and Gotham. They are true to it, honour and respect what they like best about it and regularly take it in new and interesting directions.This is actually a fairly sad and reflective movie.

And that's infinitely better than if it was just another entertaining but typical action movie. It will surely continue to grow in stature over time.

But that was during the golden age of movie making when Andy Hardy's mother would smile simply because he asked for another piece of pie and Fred Astaire would gallantly guide Ginger Rogers around the dance floor. When movies about serious issues such as alcoholism, mental illness and anti-Semitism came in, one movie mogul apparently described it with the statement about realism, So is diarrhea, but I don't want to see it on screen. Yes, we can see through our daily lives that focus on the family is an overstated attempt by certain groups to diminish the realism that families do fail, and not with the help of the groups they don't see eye to eye with. In theatrical drama, this evidence goes back to some of the classics of the American theater, particularly plays by Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee, and those plays hold up strongly today because the elements of why those families were failing were better detailed. Even the black comedy The War of the Roses showed us the motivations behind the hatred, but all American Beauty does is show us that men are sex starved pigs, that women are bitches, that teenagers are messed up because of their sex starved fathers and bitchy mothers and that there's no hope for the future generation.Certainly, this film is excellent as far as the acting is concerned, yet the characters are all extremely creepy and unlikable. Nobody plays creepy weirdos better than Kevin Spacey, and in spite of being that creepy weirdo, his character is actually somewhat understandable, albeit in a pathetic, you can't help but feel sorry for him sort of way. His lust for his nasty daughter's best friend is at first ikky to watch as is his obsession with getting out of the job that he hates with a high paid exit benefit package. Annette Bening is certainly great at playing neurotic bitches, and here she does so quite brilliantly with passive\/aggressive gusto. She's quite sweet and somewhat phony with the gay couple next door, yet she turns on her husband with the venom of a cobra towards a mongoose. The sex scene she has with rival real estate agent Peter Gallagher is filmed with a lustful anger, as if what Gallagher is doing to her she is psychologically doing to her husband.Thora Birch expresses typical teenaged bitterness and insecurities with the violent thud of an anvil being dropped from a skyscraper. She not only hates her parents, but is totally embarrassed by having them around, especially after a basketball game for which she is a cheerleader. Birch's character certainly doesn't have the personality of a cheerleader; In fact, on the court, she can't even force herself to crack a smile and just goes through the routine as if she was being forced at gunpoint to do what most teenaged girls would give their I-Phone (well, maybe not...) to do.Mena Suvari, as her cheerleader pal, is probably the most complex character here, the typically self-centered supposedly perfect girl who actually is more insecure than she lets on. In one disturbing fight scene between Birch and Suvari, her vulnerability really explodes when Birch refers to her as ordinary. How many times has somebody longed to tell off the cheerleader type to try and break their spirit, and when it happens here, it really turns out to be sad. Wes Bentley is the new kid next door, the son of an ex-Marine (a truly scary Chris Cooper), forced by his dad to take a drug test every six months. But unbeknownst to the homophobic Cooper, Bentley has a secret life of his own, a hidden supply of drugs and an obsession with filming everyone around him without their knowledge.Cooper's angry Marine is instantly incensed to find out that the neighbors two doors down is a male gay couple, but this homophobia hides something truly disturbing. Not only is there his obsession with Nazi memorabilia but his own underlying sexuality and abuse of his fragile wife (played with quiet strength by the always excellent Allison Janney). The lives of these characters intertwine to the point of an exploding volcano, a sinking ship without lifeboats, and really, the best escape from this mess turns out to be Spacey's fate. At two hours, this is a depressing and exhausting view of the messed up lives of humans too stupid to realize that they are responsible in most part for their inner destruction. After this was over, I felt as if I had been shot with a taser gun all over my body and needed extensive therapy just to recover from watching these people whom I hope never to know become more and more pathetic.

The sex scene she has with rival real estate agent Peter Gallagher is filmed with a lustful anger, as if what Gallagher is doing to her she is psychologically doing to her husband.Thora Birch expresses typical teenaged bitterness and insecurities with the violent thud of an anvil being dropped from a skyscraper. She not only hates her parents, but is totally embarrassed by having them around, especially after a basketball game for which she is a cheerleader. Birch's character certainly doesn't have the personality of a cheerleader; In fact, on the court, she can't even force herself to crack a smile and just goes through the routine as if she was being forced at gunpoint to do what most teenaged girls would give their I-Phone (well, maybe not...) to do.Mena Suvari, as her cheerleader pal, is probably the most complex character here, the typically self-centered supposedly perfect girl who actually is more insecure than she lets on. In one disturbing fight scene between Birch and Suvari, her vulnerability really explodes when Birch refers to her as ordinary. How many times has somebody longed to tell off the cheerleader type to try and break their spirit, and when it happens here, it really turns out to be sad. Wes Bentley is the new kid next door, the son of an ex-Marine (a truly scary Chris Cooper), forced by his dad to take a drug test every six months. But unbeknownst to the homophobic Cooper, Bentley has a secret life of his own, a hidden supply of drugs and an obsession with filming everyone around him without their knowledge.Cooper's angry Marine is instantly incensed to find out that the neighbors two doors down is a male gay couple, but this homophobia hides something truly disturbing. Not only is there his obsession with Nazi memorabilia but his own underlying sexuality and abuse of his fragile wife (played with quiet strength by the always excellent Allison Janney). The lives of these characters intertwine to the point of an exploding volcano, a sinking ship without lifeboats, and really, the best escape from this mess turns out to be Spacey's fate. At two hours, this is a depressing and exhausting view of the messed up lives of humans too stupid to realize that they are responsible in most part for their inner destruction. After this was over, I felt as if I had been shot with a taser gun all over my body and needed extensive therapy just to recover from watching these people whom I hope never to know become more and more pathetic.

But that was during the golden age of movie making when Andy Hardy's mother would smile simply because he asked for another piece of pie and Fred Astaire would gallantly guide Ginger Rogers around the dance floor. When movies about serious issues such as alcoholism, mental illness and anti-Semitism came in, one movie mogul apparently described it with the statement about realism, So is diarrhea, but I don't want to see it on screen. Yes, we can see through our daily lives that focus on the family is an overstated attempt by certain groups to diminish the realism that families do fail, and not with the help of the groups they don't see eye to eye with. In theatrical drama, this evidence goes back to some of the classics of the American theater, particularly plays by Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee, and those plays hold up strongly today because the elements of why those families were failing were better detailed. Even the black comedy The War of the Roses showed us the motivations behind the hatred, but all American Beauty does is show us that men are sex starved pigs, that women are bitches, that teenagers are messed up because of their sex starved fathers and bitchy mothers and that there's no hope for the future generation.Certainly, this film is excellent as far as the acting is concerned, yet the characters are all extremely creepy and unlikable. Nobody plays creepy weirdos better than Kevin Spacey, and in spite of being that creepy weirdo, his character is actually somewhat understandable, albeit in a pathetic, you can't help but feel sorry for him sort of way. His lust for his nasty daughter's best friend is at first ikky to watch as is his obsession with getting out of the job that he hates with a high paid exit benefit package. Annette Bening is certainly great at playing neurotic bitches, and here she does so quite brilliantly with passive\/aggressive gusto.

But, when he directed in his own universe, one for sure is we must be shocked and astonished. Whether you are Kubrick's fan or not, you won't forget every work of his hand. So do the controversial A Clockwork Orange, you can really define wonderful world of Kubrick thought by this very movie. It's also a great idea of Anthony Burgess, the novelist who wrote it. A pile of great literature served on the table of motion picture, in the teenage age of movie industry. That abstract combination is just the base of this art. I mean, you can't really understand what it could mean. Just watch it and translate it with your own mind, don't worry with the interpretation. The Kubrick's point is to entertain audiences with their comprehension, not his ideology or critic's opinion. Honestly, it's the first Kubrick's movie I have watched, and it leads me to characterize who is he.Let's jump to the story. It's hard to believe the cinematic effect of this movie in 1971. A real movie that you can watch in every aspect of it, such as its cinematography, settings, and strong- character. In one hand, the plot is so vivid, that you can choke all the scene entertainingly. The rape, classic ultraviolence, and all the slang. Masterpiece of dialog in this disturbing movie. A bunch full of sex-scene that shocked the entire movie fan that day even until now, but it's all make sense for the art of movie, the very bold violence. In the other hand, it's very abstract, just like the other Kubrick's work. The director often erase some important points from the novel just to make interesting effects, which is ignorance, puzzlement, yet amazement. For all impressionist, you can get very excited by its uncommon way to impress audiences. This is the point I say that it is indeed a true piece of art, no censor, vulgarity, or taboo thing, just the original amusement with its dark beauty. Comedy about blackness that isn't mark society, instead just to fulfill the art requirement. Not for the audiences who seek moral value, but suitable for you who want to criticize moral.It is divided into to part. I named it, the first is the ultraviolence, and the second is the therapy. Both of them has shadowy chasing with nasty core. The ultraviolence is dreadful as is, with the construction of awful figure. I advise, don't be to confuse, in spite of being innocent yet follower of each scene. There is no taboo here. The therapy, is just a simple conclusion that everyone could imagine. But the latent effects of this therapy is logical as Kubrick had ever done. It makes sense in the end, a simply undefined movie. It's rather a fantasy than a science- fiction, because it's so absurd, pleasantly imaginative. So surrealist, with Beethoven as the background-music. Fast motion and other effects, just to form the entire amazing sequence.Yeah, it's easy on its skin, but dark inside. A movie that is really disturbingly unforgettable. Great art.

He looks honest, she accepts it.

In Chaplin's 1925 silent comedy classic 'The Gold Rush', the Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin) is faced with a whole slew of hardships and challenges, such as biting, blistering winds, near starvation and leaping out of a cabin right before it plummets off of a cliff! And all for the sake of seeking fame and fortune, respectively. To upset matters worse, his ill-gotten attire market him as the mockery for the buffoonery of his comrades and the ruthless rigors of the frigid trek northward. However, real prospectors of the late nineteenth century as part of the Klondike Gold rush faced somewhat similar predicaments. Some came from many walks of life, some as far as the United Kingdom, South Africa and Australia. Most were perfectly aware that the chances of finding significant amounts of gold were very slim and just went along for the adventure, despite what hardships they might face, even through if it meant trenching up the discouraging but enduring Chilkoot Pass in the hopes of gaining their own individual fortunes. Prospectors had to build rafts and boats that would take them the final five-hundred plus miles down the Yukon to Dawson City, near the gold fields.

With the latest sound equipment, viewers no longer have to rely on reading lines on the screen but can enjoy listening to them being spoken, and to be alert for the tone of voice that the actor or actress is using to define the emotions given. Also, actors and actresses can actually declare their emotions out loud to each other and to the viewer as well. The film did however manage to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound Recording nonetheless. Besides the sound quality, this silent gem is also loaded with adventure, love, greed and with Chaplin, laughter, of course, this being a dramatic comedy.

It is a very serious gritty crime drama, starring Al Pacino as Tony Montana and is well supported by Michelle Pfeiffer and Steven Bauer who play his love interest and best friend respectively. Directed by Brian de Palma, this film was panned by the critics upon the film's release in 1983, due to the films vulgar and violent nature but it has aged very well and in a way it was ahead of its time, as audiences back then had not seen anything quite like itScarface is about the rise (and subsequent fall) of Tony Montana, who along with thousands of other fellow Cubans make the voyage to Miami during the cocaine boom of the 1980s. Once in America, Tony quickly gets involved in the criminal world, in which Tony rises up the criminal ranks to a point where he is a drug lord. However his greed gets the better of him and his selfish nature brings about his downfall. The cast of Scarface makes the film the masterpiece that it is, but it is really Al Pacino alone who makes it this way in a role many consider to be his greatest work in a 40-year acting career. Sure he has been criticized over the years for his over-the-top acting in this role, but this acting is exactly how Tony should be portrayed. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Tony's love interest for the film in Elvira. Pfeiffer accurately shows how tough it would be to live with someone who has a life similar to that of Tony. Steven Bauer plays Montana's best friend in Manny, in this role Bauer has delivered a good performance, as Manny is relatable and the viewer generally has feeling for him. Scarface is a great example of what happens when a film has a good director, good writer and a good cast. Brian de Palma's direction is very eye grabbing and ahead of its time, as it showcases the 80's backdrop better than most films released in the decade. The film is shown to be very dark, which keeps the audience on the edge of their seat but a tone such as this isn't very uncommon in films of a similar genre. The sound is also very good, with it accurately describing what is happening throughout the film. Scarface is a mirror image of most other gangster films in that it relies on the theme of the American dream as the main basis of its story. This is best summed when Tony is talking about life with his best friend Manny and states that, In this country you gotta make the money first. Then when you make the money you get the power. Then when you get the power, then you get the women. Scarface reaches the high standards of other films of its genre like 'Goodfellas' and the first two 'Godfathers'. The acting is first-rate, especially from the film's lead. The film's direction, (although criticised upon the films release) has aged well dramatically.

It's been quite some time since I've read it or seen it performed but I would guess that Olivier cut a good third, if not more, of the play for this film version. Most significantly, he entirely cut out the major characters of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and Fortinbras as well as quite a few minor ones. In spite of this, however, the story retains its general thrust - if not all the specifics - and the film is still magnificent as Olivier once again utterly excels as both an actor and a director. This was the first British or non-American film to win the Best Picture Actor and Olivier became the first actor to win the Best Actor Oscar for a film that he directed himself. The only other person to accomplish this feat was Roberto Benigni in La vita è bella 49 years later. Although Olivier was nominated for twelve Oscars (nine for Best Actor, one for Best Supporting Actor and two for Best Picture), this film was the only one for which he won any Academy Award.As the melancholy Dane, Olivier is absolutely wonderful. While the cuts to Henry V meant that the title character was shown in a very positive light, he did not hesitate - as either actor or director - here to emphasise his character's less desirable qualities such as his egotistical behaviour and his utter callousness when it comes to unintentionally killing Polonius. And yet Olivier's performance also draws attention to the character's psychological vulnerability after the murder of his father, thus eliciting sympathy. His lust for revenge has cut him off from his emotions, something which is also seen in his brutal rejection of Ophelia. Olivier also plays the ghost of Hamlet's father in the film and does a fantastic job in that role too.Speaking of Ophelia, the 18-year-old Jean Simmons is excellent, playing the role with a remarkable level of subtlety for someone of her age and comparatively limited acting experience. In spite of playing Hamlet's mother Gertrude, Eileen Herlie was almost eleven years younger than Olivier. While she unsurprisingly looks much younger than him, her very strong performance and great voice meant that I forgot this rather odd age gap existed almost as soon as she opened her mouth. Felix Aylmer, who played the Archbishop of Canterbury in Henry V, has a far larger role in this film as Polonius and was certainly up to the task. He's just fantastic. Basil Sydney isn't as strong as I would have liked as Claudius but he is still very good. However, I don't think that there is anyone in the film who gives a bad performance. Olivier had such a great eye for casting that it's a shame that he directed a mere five films. I wish that an artist - not usually a word that I use when referring to actors - of his calibre had been more prolific behind the camera. Aside from those actors that I have already mentioned, I would like to single out Esmond Knight (who unfortunately has a far smaller role than in Henry V), John Laurie, Terence Morgan, Anthony Quayle and Stanley Holloway. In his first British film, Peter Cushing - one of my favourite actors who, like Olivier, played Van Helsing years later - is good in the small supporting role of the foppish Osric but his performance isn't on the same level as most of his later ones. I have to say that I have never paid so much attention to the extras in a film as in this one! This is because three actors who became very well known in later years made uncredited appearances in the film Christopher Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and Patrick Macnee. In only his third film, Lee makes two blink and you'll miss them appearances just before the duel between Hamlet and Laertes. In the first instance, he appears behind his future best friend and frequent on screen nemesis Peter Cushing in what was their first of 24 films together. Llewelyn was far easier to spot as he appears quite prominently in the background of several scenes. He actually has slightly more screen time than the credited Patrick Troughton, who portrays the small but pivotal role of the Player King but doesn't have any lines. While I was on a constant lookout for Lee and Macnee (the film's only two surviving cast members), I didn't manage to spot the future John Steed. Acting aside, the film looks fantastic. In contrast to the vibrant Technicolor of Henry V, the film was shot in black and white. Apparently, this was done more for financial than artistic reasons but the black and white cinematography adds to the sense of foreboding. The use of deep focus - probably inspired by Citizen Kane - is superlative. As with Orson Welles, Olivier demonstrated that he was a master of not one but two crafts in a single film. Incidentally, Olivier had hoped to make Macbeth after Henry V but the fact that Welles was working on his own version put paid to that idea. Macbeth has always been my favourite Shakespearean play so the fact that Olivier never got to make his version of it for the big screen is hugely disappointing, particularly since it was considered one of his best roles - and that's really saying something - and it would have starred his then wife Vivien Leigh as Lady Macbeth.Overall, the film is a masterpiece in spite of the fact that it cuts significant portions of the play.

This is because three actors who became very well known in later years made uncredited appearances in the film Christopher Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and Patrick Macnee. In only his third film, Lee makes two blink and you'll miss them appearances just before the duel between Hamlet and Laertes. In the first instance, he appears behind his future best friend and frequent on screen nemesis Peter Cushing in what was their first of 24 films together. Llewelyn was far easier to spot as he appears quite prominently in the background of several scenes. He actually has slightly more screen time than the credited Patrick Troughton, who portrays the small but pivotal role of the Player King but doesn't have any lines. While I was on a constant lookout for Lee and Macnee (the film's only two surviving cast members), I didn't manage to spot the future John Steed. Acting aside, the film looks fantastic. In contrast to the vibrant Technicolor of Henry V, the film was shot in black and white. Apparently, this was done more for financial than artistic reasons but the black and white cinematography adds to the sense of foreboding. The use of deep focus - probably inspired by Citizen Kane - is superlative. As with Orson Welles, Olivier demonstrated that he was a master of not one but two crafts in a single film. Incidentally, Olivier had hoped to make Macbeth after Henry V but the fact that Welles was working on his own version put paid to that idea. Macbeth has always been my favourite Shakespearean play so the fact that Olivier never got to make his version of it for the big screen is hugely disappointing, particularly since it was considered one of his best roles - and that's really saying something - and it would have starred his then wife Vivien Leigh as Lady Macbeth.Overall, the film is a masterpiece in spite of the fact that it cuts significant portions of the play. One of my Top 30 to 35 films of all time.

The year 1940 signaled a final turning point for isolationism. German military successes in Europe prompted nationwide American rethinking about its posture toward the war. Even if America did manage to repel invasions, its way of life might wither if it were forced to become a garrison state. Isolationism now became involvement, as thousands of brave soldiers battled their way through many historical battles and a fight for ultimate freedom. Franklin Roosevelt convinced a largely isolationist Congress to pass the Land-Lease Act, allowing the U.S. to sell or lend war materials to any country whose defense the President deems vital to the defense of the United States. A true war was occurring, and the American people would never dream of succumbing to the Nazi way. However, it seemed that people across the world were all in a whirlwind of discomfort and desperation to survive. These changes, also portrayed by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), truly captivates what terror has been wrought upon the souls of Europe, and how anxious people captivated by dread and by just living one more day was a miracle in and of itself. But how did this whole outbreak of escaping and massacre soften Rick to a point where he finally did stick his neck out to a desperate couple in breaking free from the world in which he knew that ultimately became a matter of life and death? Let's take a look.From the play 'Everybody Comes to Rick's' by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison, the film opens to early December 1941, where we meet American expatriate Rick, the proprietor of an upscale nightclub and gambling den in the titular African district entitled Rick's Café Américain. From here we eventually learn that Rick is the sole ticket out of this place back to the States, of whom Rick looks over concerning problems of his own. He is suave, cool and likable, but sticks his neck out for no one. But that all changes when a long-lost love Ilsa Lund (the beautiful Ingrid Bergman) appears in his section of Morocco after a hiatus of many years (Play it, Sam.). Later, Rick sits in his darkened café at the counter of his bar, a drink in front of him to numb the pain of the memories of his past love life that and dwindled away to the present war that soured and choked out the world he once knew to cherish around him only to be replaced with death and despair. A puff of smoke dances and swirls around him as he pounds his fist down on the countertop in frustration to when he recalled simpler times to the tinny tunes of his house pianist Dooley Wilson's (Sam) somber melody (the clinking of champagne glasses compared to the sounds of gunfire). Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world.... Rick can simply not get his mind off of Ilsa, of whom he had seen earlier after years of absence, this time with a new lover by her side named Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). But Ilsa, still having feelings for Rick, needs him only to transport her and her husband back to America via passports. Rick, as mentioned before, sticks his neck out for no one, and is internally bitter at Ilsa for marrying Laszlo do to his unspoken feelings he has still kept for her all these war-torn years but has yet failed to confess. When Isla points a gun point-blank at Rick much later in the film out of utter desperation after asking him over and over for the letters of departure, Rick still keeps his cool. He knows that he would soon die anyway there and tells her that she would be doing him a personal favor. Near the end of the film a gun is pointed again, this time by Rick at a German captain as he tells him to get away from the phone. Upon refusing, Rick shoots him and the captain falls to the ground in cold blood. As Claude Reins' Captain Louis Renault, after witnessing such an act orders to his troops when they arrive on the scene to Round up the usual suspects! with Rick standing right beside them, is priceless. With flashbacks of Rick and Ilsa to easier times and days when they could enjoy each other's love and company to their present departure as Ilsa is about to head back to America on a plane with Laszlo, a story like this can still have some romance amidst a murky world surrounded by war, can't it? It's at least something Rick has left to hold on to when its all he has to stay sane in a flavorless period in history. Ranked as one of the greatest films of all time, winning Oscars for Best Script, Producer and Director by the great Michael Curtiz, 'Casablanca' is a spectacular film in and of itself and a truly remarkable albeit bittersweet love story with a mix of humor of a beautiful bond that can never be between two estranged souls but remains alive and unbroken for both to share and to hold forever in their hearts.

The way it ends, one interpretation is happily everafter. But there is another possibility, I'd say a probability, that Holly's baggage is going to take years of professional help to unpack, and Paul doesn't really know Holly when he professes his love. Where this relationship is heading, at least statistically....doesn't look real good.The guitar scene where she sings Moon River (actually her vocal double) is as good as it gets emotionally, cinematically, musically...well it won 2 Oscars for Mancini -- well deserved.I disagree that it's a period piece. The theme is timeless. What ties it to the early '60s is the artistic freedom that Capote, Edwards & Mancini were riding....making it possible to build a complex storyline and anti-hero character as a victim of childhood sex abuse. This would have been too risqué a storyline in the conformist '50s. '60s movies chased a new level of relevance and dark, gritty reality with moral ambiguity. This flick helps establish the genre.But, weren't her outfits great? Wasn't Peppard a hunk?

Plot In A Paragraph FBI Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) is still grieving for his dead son Michael. His son's killer is a powerful master criminal, Castor Troy (Nic Cage) When Archer finally captures Castor, (in a battle that leaves Troy in a coma) he finds out that Troy has planted a bomb that will destroy the entire city of Los Angeles. Unfortunately the only other person who knows its location is Castor's brother Pollux, and he refuses to talk. So Archer undergoes a special operation by a doctor that can cut off people's faces, and can place a person's face onto another person. However, Troy somehow regains consciousness and now wants revenge. Both Nic Cage (his fourth good movie in a row, following Leaving Las Vegas, The Rock and Con Air) and and John Travolta (Still riding high after Pulp Fiction) have put in some awful performances over the years, but both of them are in top form here. Dominique Swain is fine as Jamie, Travolta's daughter as is Gina Gershon and Thomas Jane in his small role.The plot is ridiculous, but when has that ever mattered in an action movie?? It's a fun ride all the same. Thanks mainly to the performances of the two leads. My bug bearer of policemen and killers never being able to hit the target when it actually matters, is here and sadly in great supply. Interestingly Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone were originally in mind to play the lead roles, but when John Woo was brought in to direct, he decided to go with John Travolta and Nic Cage.

I wasn't looking forward to it, I don't care for action movies, or Japanese movies, and the playtime of 200+ minutes.... Let's just say I put of watching this movie for a long, long time.. But then, with nothing else to do or to watch, it was time. And I won't lie to you, I have struggled through it. It was long, it was slow, it took me a while before I got what the story was about and some of the scenes didn't make sense to me. Still, I watched the full movie and I'm pretty sure I'm better for it. The best movies take effort to watch, and this one took a lot of effort. But I learned something from it, the story ended up grabbing me, not right away, but at the end. Some of the scenes were amazingly complex, at times it looked and felt like total chaos for minutes! It's a rich movie, with many stories to tell, I've never seen anything like it, that's probably one of the reasons why it was so hard to watch, but I understand now why it's in the top 250. It deserves to be! Watch it, wait for it.. and after it's gone, you will love it!
