The thought that dinosaur DNA could be trapped in bugs, then extracted and an actual dinosaur could be re-created is amazing. The first film was a classic. Another brilliant film from the master film maker Steven Speilberg (A.I, Jaws).The original was such a scary and intense film. The second film, and you knew there would be a second, was not as good, but good in its own way. It can't really compare to the first one, but it had its points of great suspense and amazing action. Now, the third film (is this a trilogy??) is a Jurassic failure. It's so short the whole film feels like a dumb Fox action show.It has no emotion, terrible acting, and a plot that has been done with the first two, only the first two did it better. Here is the plot people get stuck on the island and must get off before they are eaten by the dinosaurs. They throw in a whole bunch of crap about a kid being stranded, and a divorced couple, that is pitiful. When watching the movie, ask yourself...Do these people really seem scared?. No! They don't seem scared at all, and they just keep running and making the wrong mistakes.When you watch a good action movie, your heart should race and your blood should flow. This movie made my heart crawl up and die, and my blood freeze over. The only good action scene was when the T-rex&spinosaurus were fighting, which was WAY to short anyway. In the end, the film is sad and dissapointing. The idea of Jurassic Park is so great, and the first one was a true masterpiece...it's sad that this trash should even have the same name.I hear they are making a fourth, and they will probably make a fifth. That's what happens when a great movie comes out...they run it into the ground so by the end, its just trash. The same thing happened to Jaws, another brilliant Steven Speilberg movie. To close up my review, Jurassic park is a masterpiece, one of a kind film. The second was good action, not great and nothing like the first. The third, is a Jurassic failure. At least Steven and Michael could see that.

This movie, although far from great, compliments these three actors nicely.  Frank Oz, a very good director of such films as In & Out and Bowfinger, takes on drama for the first time and succeeds.The heist genre of films is an interesting one, but it has left its days of innovation.  So if one was expecting great things from this movie, they might be a tad disappointed.  Really I see this movie as a tribute to the genre...not an addition to it.  It follows its genre in its classic style; it does not become wild in its plot; it does not have a gunfight\/car chase\/deadly ending.  The Score is pure and professional.  It's solid entertainment.Acting, well...I think this basically goes without saying...was excellent.  Norton and De Niro were both as solid as ever.  They fulfilled their roles realistically and completely.  However, Brando, who seems to have lost his acting talent since The Godfather continued to show this downward trend.  Angela Bassett, in all of her talent, had a cliched and one-dimensional character.  Unfortunate, too, because this role could have been written into something special.  Supporting performances were excellent.  This was the key to making this film an acting gem.Direction was also a plus in this film.  This was a very quiet, tense, suspenseful film.  The ending sequence was just amazing to watch; it was done with such efficiency and vision.  It also had suspense, some twists and turns, but nothing too fantastical.

Basically his character has to give the impression to the public that a couple played by Cusack and Jones who have gone their separate ways, are really still in love with one another. Throw Julia Roberts into the mix and you have a hodgepodge of talent that does not overcrowd each other on the screen since there is really not one main character.

That's not entirely fair, for while he wasn't Oscar material, he was  really no worse an actor than Steven Seagal or Jean-Claude Van Damme . His lack of success on the silver screen is more likely due to the unfortunate fact that the American public wasn't ready for a black action star at the time and this rather kiddie-oriented film made for an inauspicious debut.
