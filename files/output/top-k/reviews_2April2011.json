[{"date":"2 April 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Charlie Chaplin was the greatest film-maker of all-time &#x85; and only two words are enough to measure up the greatness of his talent and its cultural significance in Cinema's history City Lights, a title that resonates in my heart as the most inspiring triumph of the human spirit. City Lights is not just a film; it's a cinematic gift from a genius, who sublimated the simplicity of the pantomime to create the greatest and most universal romantic comedy that ever enchanted the silver screen.The universality and emotionality of the film have remained intact, and continue to provoke the laughs and the tears of movie lovers all over the world even after 80 years. It's an incredible achievement because it stood the test of time and transcended the geographical barriers when other classics are more appreciated in a sort of sentimental and magnanimous way, as if we're trying to repress the feeling that some elements have obviously dated. But Chaplin's film hasn't dated because it chose to be dated from the start, at the time of its release. It was a silent movie in the talking era, when all the fans were enthusiastic of hearing shouts, screams, cars, declarations of loves, bad-ass dialogs and all that new stuff, Chaplin, in an admirable confidence, did what he did the best, the pantomime, the only language that could fit for the most fascinating cinematic character the Little Tramp.And what could have been a timely weakness quickly became the film's ticket for immortality. 1931's audiences applauded the film as a celebration of humanism that could never be imitated again. And only a movie with no words could have touched the hearts of so many people in the world, precisely, during an era where laughs and cheers, trust and optimism were needed. It didn't take a political or a denunciative approach to inspire the hearts, only laughs, cheers and the depiction of the most beautiful and valuables virtues of humanity. No speeches needed, words were as meaningless as these hilarious squawks we heard at the beginning. This gibberish talk is Chaplin reminding us of the futility of words, and we trust him. Maybe, dialogs make you miss the essential in a film.Antoine De Saint Exupéry, who wrote The Little Prince, said One sees well only with the heart. The essential is invisible to the eyes. I guess for Chaplin, who shared the same humanism of the French writer and pilot, you could translate his view on dialogs by this paraphrase  One sees well only with the eyes and the heart. The essential is inaudible to the ears No need for words but in City Lights, our ears are enchanted by the beautiful flower girl melody, and sadness and happiness that inhabit the film has never been so graciously embodied. And while we float in this atmosphere, the action that follows is the tribute of Chaplin's comic genius, his body language and facial expressions are so rich, so fragile I can imagine my inner child being amused by this film, while I'm moved as an adult, by the purity of the character who wants to help this blind girl who sells flowers. The Little Tramp is the quintessential clown without a make-up and a true hero, a word often overused, but not in this case.The Tramp is a hero because of his altruistic nature. He's apolitical but indirectly highlights the social gaps in the modern cities, without letting the film fall into political denunciation. He saves a rich man who wants to commit a suicide and after having developed a fondness for him, the rich makes him discover the world, amusements, dance clubs, parties, all the decadence of the bourgeoisie where the Tramp obviously doesn't fit. But he stands, as a friend, and uses the friendship to help the blind girl who believes he's a rich man. It's the myth of the Charming Prince revisited by Chaplin, through a character driven by his heart. And despise this nobility of spirit, he's constantly bullied, hit, misunderstood. And this is where resides the sadness of the film, the struggle of the Tramp in this journey into the injustices of society. But he's a man, who gets hit but hits back, never remaining a victim, victims are helpless, the girl is helpless, if he becomes so, she has no salvation, the girl is his inspiration, and the only one who never harms him in the film.And boy, how many hits did he get ... of course, I'm referring to the hilarious legendary boxing scene ... probably one of the greatest Chaplin's moments. It has the format of his short stories, but here it does have a particular meaning, since we know what drives him to do so, he wants to get the money to pay the rent for the blind girl, his challenge is our hope, and we hope he'll get it. And as the ultimate tragic hero, not only he'll help her, but he'll get enough money to cure her blindness, before going to jail, rejected by the same rich friend who gave him the money. Rich are so rich, they're perverted by money, and treat friends as they deal with valuable things, but things have no value, love, feeling and generosity have.And the value of these things are illustrated in one of the greatest, if not the greatest concluding scene ever, where the blind girl, now cured, after giving the rose to the Tramp, understands that he is the rich man, the Charming Prince who haunted her dreams. The Tramp is anxious, and timidly asks her if she can see now. The answer of the girl and the breathtaking concluding smile of the Tramp create the most beautiful and inspiring ending ever. Because she had just realized that she saw the essential, which ironically, was invisible to the eyes.
