Long gone are the musical numbers and the fairy tales, gone are the beautiful heroines and the malevolent villains; this little film is a breath of fresh air that takes Disney to the unexplored terrain of satire, parody and irreverent comedy. And the trip is well worth.The movie is about the young and arrogant Kuzco (David Spade), the Emperor of an Incan nation who enjoys his life of pleasure and comfort without caring too much for his people. Until one night, his second in command, Yzma (Eartha Kitt) betrays him and tries to poison him. Fortunately, the formula only converts Kuzco into a talking llama, however, with him in that form Yzma is able to usurp the power and gets rid of Kuzco. Now, the young Emperor will have to learn to live in a world harsher than what he knew and try to recover his throne.Well, while the plot outline sounds like another one of Disney's dramatic epic adventures, this movie has indeed a new groove. History says, that the film was actually going to go that way but director Mark Dindal and writers Chris Williams and David Reynolds took the story in a completely new direction, making a feature unlike any of the rest of Disney's classics. The film is packed with a very clever sense of humor that can be understood in many levels; it is not only mere slapstick, it goes beyond and as written above, has more in common with the Warner Bros. animations of Chuck Jones' days. The characters are perfectly well-designed and are definitely the soul of the film.However, the departure in content does not mean that the rest has changed. Despite all the apparent irreverence, the movie is suitable for kids and the morals and the message are still there, it's just that the package is now more entertaining than before. The animation technique still has Disney's top notch quality and the beautiful Inca-inspired designs give the film a fresh new look. The tone and mood of the story allows the film to explore many things that Disney had never tried and overall is a new modernization to their style.The cast is amazing and responsible of most of the success of the film. David Spade is brilliant as Kuzco and his domain of the character is total. It's hard to imagine someone else doing the voice. John Goodman plays Pacha, the only man who believes the talking llama is actually Kuzco, and his performance is very good. However, Eartha Kitt as Yzma and Patrick Warburton as her sidekick Kronk steal the show. If Spade and Goodman are brilliant then Kitt and Warburton are simply perfect.The film is definitely among the funniest films ever done by Disney and it is almost flawless. Even when it uses some pop culture references the film doesn't feel dated or silly thanks to the very subtle way that kind of humor is used. Still, the movie has been attacked for deviating from the classic Disney film and while the criticism has some good points (the film's simplicity for example), it still is a memorable and effective film that delivers lots of laughs and pure entertainment.The Emperor's New Groove may not be a landmark of animation such as Beauty and the Beast, but personally I think it represents a breath of fresh air for Disney and one of the most funny animated films ever done. While it is understandable that not everyone will catch the film's humor, this personal favorite is a very recommended film. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 July 2006","score":"","review":" The Emperor's New Groove is a bit different to what Disney had accustomed us so far; well, to tell it is a lot different to that, in fact, it could be said that this animated film is closer to the crazy and brilliant minds of Tex Avery and Chuck Jones than to the classic Disney animated features.

Thus we had Olivier's trilogy of Henry V, Richard III and Hamlet, Welles's Othello and Macbeth, Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet, Heston's Antony and Cleopatra (something of a rarity, but still worth seeing) and the Brando\/Mason\/Gielgud version of Julius Caesar. Shakespeare's comedies were less common in the cinema, probably because so much Shakespearean humour is based either upon puns and wordplay which worked better in Elizabethan English than they do in the modern language or upon topical references to the events of the 1590s and 1600s, lost upon today's audiences. There was that old Midsummer Night's Dream from the thirties and Derek Jarman's rather eccentric version of The Tempest, but generally the cinema took the view that the comedies were best left to the theatre and television.With his own version of Henry V, well-received by most critics when it came out in 1989, Kenneth Branagh inherited Olivier's role as Britain's leading cinematic Shakespearean. It was perhaps something of a gamble for him to choose a comedy as his second Shakespeare adaptation, but it was a gamble that paid off. The film was shot in a villa in the hills of Tuscany and in the beautiful, sunlit surrounding countryside. The costumes are vaguely nineteenth-century, but the clear intention was to set the story in a timeless, never-never land, a sort of rustic earthly paradise. (Those claiming supposed anachronisms as goofs, therefore, have rather missed the point. It does not matter whether they had piano-accordions in sixteenth-century Sicily, as this film is obviously not aiming at an accurate recreation of sixteenth-century Sicilian life).Just like the original paradise, this one contains a serpent in the shape of Don John, the evil brother of the Prince of Messina. What is technically the main plot of Shakespeare's play concerns Don John's spiteful machinations to frustrate the marriage of the young soldier Claudio to the beautiful Lady Hero by making false accusations of unchastity against her. I say technically because this storyline often has to take second place to the sub-plot about the wooing of Beatrice and Benedick. Benedick starts out as a confirmed bachelor and Beatrice an ardent proto-feminist, but (in a plot development which has been copied in thousands of romantic comedies ever since) they end up by falling in love with one another. Their verbal duels were so popular with audiences that at one time the play was better known as Beatrice and Benedick than by its official title.In the late eighties and early nineties Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thomson (Ken and Em) were the golden couple of the British acting profession. Like a number of other golden couples (Larry and Viv, Richard and Liz, Jude and Sadie), their relationship was eventually to end unhappily, but while they were together they were cast opposite one another in a number of productions, and it is they who take on the roles of the feuding pair. Both were practised Shakespearean actors, and they speak their lines with great clarity and simplicity, bringing out all the humour and drama in their parts. Richard Briers is equally good as Leonato, Hero's aged father. Hero herself, despite her central role in the drama, is, on the page, a rather colourless figure, but the lovely Kate Beckinsale, in her first major film role, makes her a delightful and unaffected heroine.Besides a number of leading British stage actors, Branagh also cast several Hollywood stars, doubtless with an eye to the American box office. He was criticised for this in Britain, but in my view, given the unreal, idealised world in which the film is set, the mixture of British and American accents does not matter. Nor does the fact that Messina has a black Duke with a Hawaiian brother, although all of his subjects are white.The most criticised of the American stars seems to have been Keanu Reeves. Although he is perhaps not the greatest speaker of blank verse, I must say in his defence that, psychologically, he seems just right for the role of Don John. Whereas the other characters are full of high spirits and good humour, he is a saturnine figure who seems to radiate gloom and ill-will, a man whose malice arises from his envy of the happiness of others. Of the others, Denzel Washington is appropriately dignified as Don Pedro. Robert Sean Leonard rather struggles with Claudio, but it is a thankless role, a man who is technically the romantic lead but whose jealousy and credulity make him a rather unsympathetic figure. The one actor I did not like was Michael Keaton who over-acts frantically in a weird accent as the drunken constable Dogberry, but even he did not spoil the film for me.A special mention must go to the wonderful theme music by Patrick Doyle, essentially a single theme which is heard, in a number of guises, throughout. (Figure-skating fans like me will always recall this as the music to which Tonya Harding skated at the 1994 Winter Olympics while under suspicion for the attack on Nancy Kerrigan; rumour had it that the choice of music from a film about a woman wrongly accused was a quite deliberate gesture to protest her innocence).This stirring theme fits the mood of the film perfectly. It is a film about love, laughter, happiness, friendship, sunlight and the beauty of nature- in short, a film about everything that makes life worth living. In my view, the greatest-ever film of a Shakespeare comedy.

Why? Because it simply includes everything which builds a great story, and that is all films really are, storytelling.The concept of story telling can very easily be lost and forgotten in an industry that can sell cinema tickets by using special effects and employing world super stars like Tom Cruise. That may well be the easy option, but films that rely on pretty faces and big budgets will never be remembered. It is films like Shawshank that will lodge themselves into people hearts, and will be passed down by many generations.This is because everyone that watches this film becomes a part of it. You are there, in that prison, suffering when Andy does, smiling when Andy does. Tim Robbins plays this part so well it could be classed in one of the best lead parts in a film ever.

Ash is now made almost the antihero when he becomes the last person alive from the horrible ordeal.This film wasn't always smooth sailing(as if any low-budget film is), the movie in whole took 5 years to make because of lack of funding. You can see Bruce age from age 21 to age 26, you also see him sustain real injuries and many of the cuts on his face during the film are real. Also many of the actors left the film during filming, so many locals were called to finished the characters role, including Sam Raimi(director) and his brother Ted(who is in almost everyone of his brothers films).Unlike other horror films, there is no sex,(there's no hanky-panky in this film, kids!-Bruce Campbell). Which makes the film more professional, But Sam still flashed a girl topless just for laughs. Sam tried to capture what real teenagers would do in a cabin miles from the nearest town, But when Bruce inhaled real marijuana smoke in front of the camera for a scene, he was totally senseless(he'd never done drugs before). But still the totally untrained actors tried there best to do every stunt, every emotion, everything that Sam threw at them for as little pay as $100 a week.

Unlike other biopics with jump from childhood to adulthood, simply showing us more of a documentary-like look at the subjects life instead a single, consistent story, this film delivers an incredible real-life journey for the greatest boxer of all time, Muhammad Ali. The film covers a ten-year period, between 1964 and 1974. It begins with Ali winning his title from Sonny Liston, and shortly after converting to the Nation of Islam. The film shows how turbulent the times were in the 1960s. Black people everywhere were fighting for their rights, and in different ways. Martin Luthor King Jr. was a devout Christian who preached patience and peace, while Malcolm X represented the Nation of Islam, which was understandably outraged by the discrimination against them, and demanded fair treatment. Ali is obviously a Muslim, and a close friend of Malcolm X's. However, things start to dissolve for Ali after his conversion. The demands of the Nation of Islam and their radical leader Elijah Muhammad force Ali to challenge his friendships and marriage. But he stands by it, even to the point where he is stripped of his Heavyweight Title and threatened with Jail Time for standing up for his religious beliefs. But instead of backing him in this time of crisis, the Nation abandons him. However, Muhammad is fiercely loyal, never turning is back on the Nation, despite his frustrations. The Nation even goes so far as to suspend Muhammad from the practice of Islam. Muhammad stands up for two principals He never stopped being a Muslim, and he never stopped being the champ. His two goals are to continue in his beliefs, and to win back his title, appealing to the Nation of Islam, and fighting everyone he has to to get to the World Champion. This all takes it's toll on Ali, from his first humiliating defeat in the ring, to even straining his marriage with his wife Belinda. Ali is not drawn as the upright and flawless hero. He is shown having an affair not behind his wife's back, but in front of news cameras. But however flawed the man may be, he sticks by his principals. His marriage going down the toilet, he demands, does not plead for, the approval of the Nation of Islam, and battles legendary fights with Joe Fazier and George Foreman. All of Ali's frustrations and troubles over the past ten years are brought to a boiling point by the film's climactic battle, which chronicles what is widely renowned as the greatest boxing match of all time.Overall, not only is this an incredible journey, but it is fascinating to watch a film directed by Michael Mann, to see the cinematography, film editing, and how it fits with the music.

Rich Mrs. Violet Venable (Katharine Hepburn) wants her niece Catherine Holly (Elizabeth Taylor) lobotomized because she has been acting very strange over something she saw last summer. Slowly (VERY slowly) we find out what it was.I never saw the play but I heard it was short and runs just under 90 minutes--this movie goes on for almost 2 hours! It's full of long endless conversations half of which had nothing to do with the plot (especially the first conversation between Hepburn and Clift). It was pretty obvious (to me at least) what was going on fairly early in the movie but this just drags everything out to a ridiculous degree.**SPOILER ALERT--ENDING GIVEN AWAY!!** It seems that Taylor was being used to lure young men for her gay cousin Sebastian to have sex with. Before that his mother (Hepburn) was doing it! Some of the kids rebel and kill and partially devour him in front of Taylor's horrified eyes (not shown BTW).**SPOILER END**The play was also cleaned up for the screen version but (for its time) this was pretty shocking. It does have its good points. It was well-directed by Joseph Mankiewicz (especially at the end) and it looks great. Hepburn was just perfect in her role and Taylor is incredible--this had to be a tough role but she's great in it and really lets loose (especially during her confession scene at the end). Unfortunately Clift is pretty terrible but he was in pain and addicted to drugs and alcohol when this was made. The treatment of a gay man may be offensive to some but it didn't bother me (for the record I'm gay). Also it was written by Gore Vidal and Tennessee Williams who were also gay.

Rich Mrs. Violet Venable (Katharine Hepburn) wants her niece Catherine Holly (Elizabeth Taylor) lobotomized because she has been acting very strange over something she saw last summer. Slowly (VERY slowly) we find out what it was.I never saw the play but I heard it was short and runs just under 90 minutes--this movie goes on for almost 2 hours! It's full of long endless conversations half of which had nothing to do with the plot (especially the first conversation between Hepburn and Clift). It was pretty obvious (to me at least) what was going on fairly early in the movie but this just drags everything out to a ridiculous degree.**SPOILER ALERT--ENDING GIVEN AWAY!!** It seems that Taylor was being used to lure young men for her gay cousin Sebastian to have sex with. Before that his mother (Hepburn) was doing it! Some of the kids rebel and kill and partially devour him in front of Taylor's horrified eyes (not shown BTW).**SPOILER END**The play was also cleaned up for the screen version but (for its time) this was pretty shocking. It does have its good points. It was well-directed by Joseph Mankiewicz (especially at the end) and it looks great. Hepburn was just perfect in her role and Taylor is incredible--this had to be a tough role but she's great in it and really lets loose (especially during her confession scene at the end). Unfortunately Clift is pretty terrible but he was in pain and addicted to drugs and alcohol when this was made. The treatment of a gay man may be offensive to some but it didn't bother me (for the record I'm gay). Also it was written by Gore Vidal and Tennessee Williams who were also gay.
