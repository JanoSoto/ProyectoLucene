[{"date":"5 December 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Rushmore is one of two films which I've seen far too many times, the other being Vertigo. They are very different films, of course, but I suppose what keeps me coming back to both is that they are perhaps among the purest, most perfect examples of an auteur's vision. There are certainly many reasons to see all of Wes Anderson's films, after all he is a contemporary master, albeit an acquired taste thanks to all the dry humor and quirk. I've watched Rushmore with people who didn't even smile once, which seems impossible to me.Everyone knows what the film is about by now, so I won't go into any detail on that. The romantic triangle here with Bill Murray's character Herman Blume, Jason Schwartzman as Max Fischer, and Olivia Williams as Rosemary Cross, a gorgeous young widow who teaches at the titular Rushmore Academy, is gloriously off-beat and improbable, but shockingly evocative of not only the feeling of being in love and the obsession that sometimes follows, but of the adolescent mindset and how it relates to adulthood, and how we probably never really leave it behind. It's really wonderful.One of the most-criticized aspects of Rushmore is Max Fischer himself. A lot of people complain that he's not 'sympathetic'. Now, I've seen the movie too many times to mention here without embarrassment and I'm pretty sure that we're not supposed to adore Max, accept all his actions (which involve sabotage, putting bees in Herman's hotel room, climbing up to Rosemary's window on a rainy night and pretending to have been hit by a car, and several other self-centered acts) as valid, or feel sorry for him. See Charlie Bartlett for something pretty similar which makes all the mistakes possible within this format as well as creating a lead character who is inconceivably ego-centric and cocky, without any of the psychological depth there is to Max's character. Max Fischer ultimately feels human, and I'm sick of the need for audiences to have 'likable' characters (read movie clichés, sometimes disguised, but still idealized). I completely buy Max Fischer as a character because I completely buy that the person could exist. Could all of the things that happen in this film happen? Probably not, but it's made so very believable by the stunning writing, which adds depth and layers to even the most minor characters.The humor is highly subjective of course, but it's always worth praising this script by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson. It's so consistently funny, outrageous, and always with a touch of class and intelligence, always with a humbling human element that produces an almost surprising amount of emotion when you least expect it. The technical aspects of the film, particularly the photography by regular Anderson collaborator Robert Yeoman, are top-notch. Stylistically the film is refreshing and evocative, with more sophistication and class than Anderson's Bottle Rocket. Wes Anderson is an absolutely phenomenal director; his style is completely his own though obviously inspired by Satyajit Ray and Hal Ashby, and he always manages to inject real emotion into his films and occasionally a surprising amount of sweetness without any cloying sentimentality. At 93 minutes in length, Rushmore is essentially all you will ever need to know about Wes Anderson in a neat little package. It's got the dark humor, it's got the quirk which is still completely believable and real (people who complain about Wes Anderson being 'everything that's wrong with 'indie' film' are probably best left ignored or at least directed towards Diablo Cody, Mark Poirier, whoever wrote Little Miss Sunshine, and all the rest of those hacks to see quirk for quirk's sake, and to an almost unbelievable extent), it's got the pathos, the dark, real emotion, and the phenomenal use of music. All of Anderson's films are worth seeing, all of them even great, but none match the stunning power and resonance of Rushmore, which is still one of the best films ever made, and not 'overrated' in the slightest.
