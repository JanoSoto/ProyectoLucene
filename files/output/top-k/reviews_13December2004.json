Well this film caught my eyes and lingered in my mind, and then I began thinking of it. Romantic stories, always happen in places that will just make you feel romantic, which just make me feel bored of. But in this film, it just gives me the impression that it always rains, though not that much, it does a lot. It just makes me feel down, humid, gloomy, crowd, and what the humid air makes me feel is like what I feel about Simon¡¯s life as a gay artist, a little creepy somehow, and the gloom is what Melvin gives who is a obsessive-compulsive disorder writer. He just makes me feel depressed, he is full of love at least in his mind, but he always come up with really sarcastic words and just gives you the impulse to run when you did see him open his mouth, and his expression when he speaks is----maybe he can try acting the horrible role I think. Carol is a single mother who is struggling to raise her chronically asthmatic son, she just makes me feel like if I were her, maybe I would get cracked up someday, she seems always messed up in mind, maybe she¡¯s too worried about her son and suspicious about Melvin¡¯s love. They all give me a different feelings and...so why not like it? It¡¯s the great performance given by these good actors; they are really into their roles!Melvin¡¯s love to that little dog, Simon whom then became his friend, Carol the woman he is in love with, warms up this humid down world and many many cold cold hearts, like one here¡­I still remember what he said to Simon and what he did to his pet, he was so awful there. And like Carol, at first I am worried that Melvin might turns out to be some middle-aged man with some ulterior purposes¡­But everything is getting as good as it is with him since tries to show his love and kindness to others¡­ Well a satisfactory and happy ending!! It sounds quite unbelievable but everything is possible for there is love in our life. So do not try to hide your love, show it to people around you, and everything will go on well with you!!!

Directed by Spike Lee, this movie takes an in depth look at exactly how many variables are involved when being the MVP, and how a man can grow up and assess these circumstances.Ray Allen plays a character who's name is Jesus Shuttlesworth. At a young age, his father pressed him dramatically to be the best he could be. However by mistake kills Jesus's mother and is sent to prison. The troubled child eventually grows up to become one for the best players in the nation. Now the drama builds up. When the decision to go pro or join a college team is just around the corner, Jesus's father (played by Denzel Washington) is let out of jail to convert his son to a specific school or else the father is returned to jail, it leaves Jesus with a daunting task. The reconcile between the father and son is what eventually allows Jesus to become a real man and face his problems.The idea that a boy cannot live without his father plays a defined role in this movie. Jesus grows up with the responsibilities of taking care of his sister, who is several years younger than he is. While it appears that Jesus has all of the support in the world, Spike Lee does a terrific job of accentuating how they are really leeches. All the people want are money, fame, and fortune; which is all possible through Jesus. The reason the father plays such a key role is because although he needs Jesus's help, he isn't interested in that. He really loves his son.Although Spike Lee did some amazing work with this movie especially with the inner city sequences, as well as the use of colors and poetry to his advantage for getting his ideas across to the audience, several scenes were unneeded which seemed overly explicit. Although these are truly issues that can ruin a famous person, they seemed almost too graphic to be seen by a general audience. What Spike does so well is keeping the real connections with the street, and enabling the audience to see exactly what the character is going through by using several techniques. Colors in the movie such as red, green, and black symbolize power, pain, and respect between different characters. While Jesus hates his name, his father named him that through a basketball player that was how he put it, the truth. This movie proves that in real life, you can benefit more by forgiving, and not forgetting.Overall I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a unique, intellectual film that will make you think about your present situation, as well as allowing you to know the difficulties that come with fame.

On the one hand, sometimes I feel like I am extremely harsh to movies that I can't stand (read my reviews of Scary Movie 1, 2, or 3, for example), but on the other hand, maybe I didn't hate Species II as much as many people because I've seen more bad movies than they have. I have a bad habit of watching movies even if I already know I'm going to hate them (this is why I've seen Scary Movie, 2 and 3, for example), so this may be why I've been a little bit numbed to idiocy in the movies.I can certainly recognize stupidity at any level when I see it in the movies, and there is plenty of it in Species II, but it takes a lot more than this movie has for me to describe it as the worst movie I've ever seen or a total waste of celluloid or some other such nonsense. It is certainly not, for example, a grade Z exploitation flick, ripe for the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 treatment. In a massive lapse of cognitive function, scientists, including Dr. Baker from the 1st movie, have decided to make a clone of Sil, this time named Eve, to study her more extensively than they had the chance last time. They somehow made her more docile and controllable (although still female), and she cooperates with them, suffering through the tests and tortures that she has to endure for them to demonstrate things like her remarkable ability to heal. After one such session, Dr. Baker walks Eve back to her glass holding cell, and Eve tiredly asks Dr. Baker something like, Why do you do this to me? Eve spends her time reading and learning to drive by watching Dukes of Hazzard, her favorite show, when she's not being poked and prodded by people in white coats. The only thing that the scientists seem to remember about Sil from the last movie is her unstoppable sex drive, so men are not allowed anywhere inside the area where she is kept, at least until the end when Dennis Gamble (Mykelti Williamson), one of the men on the mission to Mars casually walks in, walks right up to the glass and tries to flirt with her. Good thing she was unimpressed by his genetic code, otherwise they may have had a serious security breach on their hands.While scientists were busy studying Eve for some kind of weakness that they could use should another, ah, outbreak occur, other scientists are busy successfully completing the first manned mission to Mars. On the way back, there is a lapse of communication for seven minutes, I think, and the next thing you know one of the scientists has been infected with alien DNA, much like the stuff running through Eve's veins. Evidently the smart aliens (in this series, the ones in space, off-screen, sending intelligent radio signals to earth) have intercepted the Mars mission and sent a scout back to earth for another shot at those pesky humans. But fear not, it's not long before the slimy monster aliens take over the colonization efforts.Given the feeble plot, it's not hard to see why Species II focuses entirely on the sexual aspect of the alien species. Natasha Henstridge is not most, but ALL of the draw that this movie has, so they have to pander to who they know is in the theaters. And judging from what happens during the movie, most of the people in theaters are adolescent boys who really shouldn't be watching this movie. Okay that was a guess, but while Natasha gets topless for about three seconds, there is still extensive nudity and group sex in the movie, most of which results in bloody birth scenes stolen from the Alien movies, as he steadily compiles a growing herd of offspring.Dennis Gamble, the token black guy and comic relief, has no purpose but to constantly complain that he can never get any booty, until scientists inform him that because he's a carrier of sickle cell anemia, his blood can be used as a weapon against the alien. In the movie's defense, there is a great scene where Patrick Ross, who was infected in space, finally reaches Eve, with whom his hormones have been communicating since he got back to earth, and they have an intense love scene from opposite sides of thick glass. Interesting in that it is a shining moment of skillful acting in an otherwise dreary slog of drivel.Also, I have to admit that I was impressed with the head regeneration scene, but only in the way that I was impressed with many of the special effects in Hollow Man. It was a fascinating thing to watch, despite all the while being very obviously a special effect. If you absolutely loved the first film (and I mean LOVED it), then you may enjoy this one slightly as well. But in the Species series even more than normal, if you didn't like the original you'll hate the sequel. And in some cases, hating this sequel doesn't even require a lukewarm opinion of the original.

When it's funny, it's very funny and the film features a number of real stand out moments, such as the power mad general dishing out the new laws he's made, and of course Allen's neurotic dialogue, which is always a treat. However, at a number of moments; you get the impression that Woody Allen is trying to be funny, but he's failing miserably, which only serves in being annoying. This is Woody Allen while he was still in his rather immature phase (everything before Annie Hall), and it shows by way of the rather ludicrous plot, which sees Allen losing he girl he is infatuated with, on the grounds of him not having leadership qualities. So, he goes on the holiday to San Marcos that the two of them were meant to go on, and somehow gets caught up with a group rebels there that are trying to provoke a revolution, and eventually becomes president. Hey, I told you it was silly!In Woody's immature period, he had several hit's and misses, with Sleeper being at the foot of his filmography, and the wonderful Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex at the summit. This one is more hit than miss, but to call it an actual 'hit' would be lying. Basically, Woody doesn't capitalise on the more interesting parts of the story, and instead seems all to keen to show us some slapstick humour. Although this is funny at a number of times, this film could have been a biting political satire on how America deals with other nations, or maybe even how rebels fail once they come to power. It could have even been an interesting commentary on the superficiality of love. Maybe Allen could have outdone himself and gone for all three! Basically, this is a 7\/10 movie where a 10\/10 one could have been. Don't get me wrong, this is definitely a good film and well worth watching, particularly for the Woody Allen fan; it's just unfortunate that it came at a time when Woody was still a clown.

This is Woody Allen while he was still in his rather immature phase (everything before Annie Hall), and it shows by way of the rather ludicrous plot, which sees Allen losing he girl he is infatuated with, on the grounds of him not having leadership qualities. So, he goes on the holiday to San Marcos that the two of them were meant to go on, and somehow gets caught up with a group rebels there that are trying to provoke a revolution, and eventually becomes president. Hey, I told you it was silly!In Woody's immature period, he had several hit's and misses, with Sleeper being at the foot of his filmography, and the wonderful Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex at the summit. This one is more hit than miss, but to call it an actual 'hit' would be lying. Basically, Woody doesn't capitalise on the more interesting parts of the story, and instead seems all to keen to show us some slapstick humour. Although this is funny at a number of times, this film could have been a biting political satire on how America deals with other nations, or maybe even how rebels fail once they come to power. It could have even been an interesting commentary on the superficiality of love. Maybe Allen could have outdone himself and gone for all three! Basically, this is a 7\/10 movie where a 10\/10 one could have been. Don't get me wrong, this is definitely a good film and well worth watching, particularly for the Woody Allen fan; it's just unfortunate that it came at a time when Woody was still a clown.

What I really enjoyed about this film was seeing all of those who have participated in the series, both in front & behind the camera playing themselves (oddly though, RACHEL TALALY in nowhere to be seen). I really had a hoot watching them play themselves & how the NIGHTMARE series has effected their lives. I loved how Freddy was portrayed here, he's darker, leaner, meaner & far more terrifying Freddy Kruger, like the original film & Part 2, Freddy is once again played as a straight forward & deadly menace, not a wise cracking dream demon he later became in the series, which I felt cheapened the character. Freddy is also graced with a brand new look, with a long black trench coat, black leather pants & boots, a mechanical razor glove & a demonic look. ROBERT ENGLUND really segues into the role here & is devilish perfection as the character. Despite the positive changes & a return to form of the first two films, darker edged character & story lines, NEW NIGHTMARE unfortunately earns the rather ominous distinction of being the series lowest earning entry at the box office. No doubt fans were a little hesitant about seeing another NIGHTMARE film after being burned by several mediocre entries to the franchise. In a way the whole film pre-dates SCREAM & it's many sequels, no doubt had the film been made about a year or two after SCREAM's release, the film would have done fantastic box office & much better reviews than it got when it was first released. It just missed the curve a bit & no doubt a lot of fans didn't really get it, or what it was trying to do. Plus the state of the horror genre was probably the perfect statement on why it performed poorly. Horror was dead then. It managed to break the fourth wall, by showing the real people who played these characters & it was fun watching them play themselves, rather than some made up characters. Freddy himself is wisely kept off screen for most of the film & only used sparingly & I felt this made him even creepier, rather than over exposing him like the sequels did. In fact, it's about an hour in, or close to it before you even see him on screen, but yet his presence is definitely felt throughout the film & the story so fascinating, you hardly notice, since Wes cleverly allows the audience to get drawn in to his characters, diolg & situations. Thankfully the seeds of success that were planted by the original 1984 film & it's earlier sequels, that brought Freddy into our pop culture are back, embodied in the spirit of NEW NIGHTMARE, everything that was old & stale is now fresh & alive again! More importantly, the series slide from shocking brilliance to mediocrity, with the latter sequels was now mercifully over, the spirit was more alive than ever. The concept was very original & just what was needed to get the series back on track. This one easily has to be in the top three best sequels! the scares here are much more effective & elaborate than any of the scares the sequels conjured up. There's several effective twists & new idea's. There are several knowing nods to the first, the opening scene where Freddy is building his glove, ELMER BERNSTIEN's score is used frequently, (there's even a nod to Part 5, with a fake Freddy head attacked to someone's face as it's pulling away) Heather in her pyjama's, seeing the original film play on the TV screen, her hair has a streak of white in it & she occasionally utters a line or two from the first film. Freddy emerging from the sheets, snakes & eels attack Heather when she is in Freddy's dungeon, Heather getting her feet caught in glop as she mounts a set of steps to try & save her son & Freddy sticking his tongue out of the mouth piece of the telephone, after talking to Heather, the scratches Freddy gives her on her arm is similar to those she experienced in the first & even a victim is killed the way her friend Tina was in the first movie. And the film also pokes it's salty finger in they eyes of not only the MPAA, but those who think horror films do damage to young children. Interestingly, the film also appears to be a modern day take on HANSEL & GRETEL, Heather reads her son the story & the climax sees Freddy pushed into his own oven after he tries to eat her son, Heather swallowing several sleeping pills left by her son, so she can find him & take him home. On the downside MIKO HUGHES who plays Heather's son really got on my nerves, I just didn't care for this character to much & I could have done without that cheesy EXORCIST like scene, where he vomits pea soup all over Heather. NICK CORRI has a cameo here but where's RONEE BLAKELY, AMANDA WYSS & JOHNNY DEPP? All in all I highly recommend you see NEW NIGHTMARE, it's fun, it's witty & it's just as scary & clever now as it was back then. One of Craven's best films! Followed by a reel sequel - FREDDY VS.

I like it as good film making, but on another level I'm made very uneasy by it.As a movie, it's a whole lot of fun; what we have here is a cowboys & indians sort of film, set in 1920s Chicago with Feds and gangsters. Lots of shoot-'em-up action, hard bitten, laconic dialogue, and even some dark humor. There's something for everyone here.I was especially surprised, as well as amused, by De Palma's shootout sequence in the railroad station. It's an unabashed homage to Serge Eisensten's staircase sequence in THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN. De Palma manages to lend it a sort of dark humor to go along with the flying bullets and gouts of blood. It's hard to tell if he was paying tribute to POTEMKIN or if he was creating a parody of it, but it IS quite an effective sequence.Special mention and praise is richly deserved by Sean Connery for his part as Jim Malone, the wise, world weary Chicago beat cop who takes Costner's neophyte Elliot Ness under his wing and teaches him the ways of Chicago style law enforcement. Connery's not only a great actor, but an enthusiastic scenery chewer of long standing; he has a GREAT time with the script & steals practically every scene he's in. I can imagine his scarcely concealed glee at delivering his most hard bitten lines... OK Pal, why the Mohaska? when he first meets Ness and discovers he's carrying a gun. He delivers THE memorable line of the film with his sage advice on dealing with Al Capone...If he pulls a knife, YOU pull a gun. If HE sends one of yours to the hospital, YOU send one of HIS to the MORGUE. THAT'S the Chicago Way!!!.Connery must have had a ball with the part, and it's clear that he enjoyed every minute of his over-the-top performance. Also worthy of praise was another over-the-top performance, De Niro's somewhat wild and savage portrayal of Alphonse Snorky Capone. Here's another scene stealer of the first order. Rod Stieger's take on Capone is certainly much more real, but De Niro's is a whole lot more FUN... it's closer to the legend than the truth.Chicagoans (and us ex-Chicagoans) are a sort of a strange breed; over the decades Al Capone has become a larger than life legend for us, and we're prone to hold an odd sort of pride and affection for the gangster past of our city... many see Capone as a sort of Robin Hood figure in our past, as was shown in the Rat Pack film, ROBIN AND THE SEVEN HOODS. Snorky is, without a doubt, the most famous Chicagoan that there is, with Richard J. Daley, the ultimate political boss, running a distant second. Even today if anyone has the temerity to speak badly of Al Capone in the presence of a Chicagoan, he'll most likely get an earful of the perceived virtues of the man to counterbalance the criticisms. De Niro's performance does the Capone legend justice, and does honor to the Big Guy.Watching veteran actors De Niro and Connery absolutely steamroller the rest of the cast is a joy to behold. It would have been interesting to see the two of them TOGETHER in more sequences, to watch them try to upstage each other... the rest of the cast didn't have a prayer in that contest with either one of them!Costner's deliberately understated and almost effeminate portrayal of Elliot Ness is, ironically, probably closer to reality than any of the many other screen portrayals he's had. Mentioning Elliot Ness to my father or grandfather usually elicited a sneering obscenity or two, occasionally comments speculating about Ness's sexual preferences, and the standard comment that Ness wasn't a REAL cop; he was merely a paper shuffling tax man. This seems to be a widely held opinion of Ness among the generation of Chicagoans who lived through those times. Suffice it to say that the memory of Elliot Ness isn't held in high regard with many of them.That's what's good here. There's another side to this coin tho.Americans have, unfortunately, become a people who are more and more ignorant of their own history. What little we know about it comes from movies and pop cultural sources that are, due to artistic license, JUST PLAIN WRONG!!! THE UNTOUCHABLES is guilty of that.For all of it's entertainment value the film is, historically speaking, a pack of utter BS. That's sort of dangerous; these days movies are cited more and more as historical reference, and the artistic license becomes fact.Given that premise, movies CAN and DO rewrite history in the popular culture. We've seen it happen before in Hollywood's version of the settling of the West.It's called Propaganda. And it's dangerous to the health of the Republic to expose an uncritical public to it in large doses. The most glaring example in THE UNTOUCHABLES... the death of Frank The Enforcer Nitti, as depicted in the film.NO WAY is it anywhere near accurate; the reality is that after Capone's conviction, Nitti was also facing a prosecution that he had no prayer of beating. Before he could be brought to trial, Frank Nitti took his own life.If taken in context, STRICTLY for it's entertainment value, I can heartily endorse THE UNTOUCHABLES.

It would have been interesting to see the two of them TOGETHER in more sequences, to watch them try to upstage each other... the rest of the cast didn't have a prayer in that contest with either one of them!Costner's deliberately understated and almost effeminate portrayal of Elliot Ness is, ironically, probably closer to reality than any of the many other screen portrayals he's had. Mentioning Elliot Ness to my father or grandfather usually elicited a sneering obscenity or two, occasionally comments speculating about Ness's sexual preferences, and the standard comment that Ness wasn't a REAL cop; he was merely a paper shuffling tax man. This seems to be a widely held opinion of Ness among the generation of Chicagoans who lived through those times. Suffice it to say that the memory of Elliot Ness isn't held in high regard with many of them.That's what's good here. There's another side to this coin tho.Americans have, unfortunately, become a people who are more and more ignorant of their own history. What little we know about it comes from movies and pop cultural sources that are, due to artistic license, JUST PLAIN WRONG!!! THE UNTOUCHABLES is guilty of that.For all of it's entertainment value the film is, historically speaking, a pack of utter BS. That's sort of dangerous; these days movies are cited more and more as historical reference, and the artistic license becomes fact.Given that premise, movies CAN and DO rewrite history in the popular culture. We've seen it happen before in Hollywood's version of the settling of the West.It's called Propaganda. And it's dangerous to the health of the Republic to expose an uncritical public to it in large doses. The most glaring example in THE UNTOUCHABLES... the death of Frank The Enforcer Nitti, as depicted in the film.NO WAY is it anywhere near accurate; the reality is that after Capone's conviction, Nitti was also facing a prosecution that he had no prayer of beating. Before he could be brought to trial, Frank Nitti took his own life.If taken in context, STRICTLY for it's entertainment value, I can heartily endorse THE UNTOUCHABLES. The trick here is to NOT believe everything that you see. Legends can be fun... but consider that Legends are NOT TRUTH.

Guests were Kit Carson, co-screenwriter, and his son, Hunter Carson, who played the seven-year old boy in the movie. The house was packed, with many from what passes for the film industry in Houston. Kit and Hunter (now 27, I guess) were introduced, then a 20-minute short directed by Hunter, with Tim Roth, was shown, then the feature, then a Q&A period. Lots of discussion. It was fun for Houstonians to see the use of Texas and (particularly) Houston scenes (vintage 1984). Crazy geography, of course, for those who live here. The road trip where Travis and Hunter follow Jane starts on one freeway, to switch immediately to a freeway on another side of town, then another freeway switcheroo. No problem; it's the movies. Many here have lauded the movie, and I certainly liked it last night (as I did 20 years ago), and will try not to repeat what others have said. I especially liked the home movie that Travis' brother shows when he is staying with the family in Los Angeles. It contains the first view one has of the elusive ex-wife, Jane (Kinsky) and you should feel really pulled in by the former happiness of the little family, and eager for the return of that bliss, as Travis apparently is. I also really liked the first visit of Travis to the peep show in Houston where Jane works. (The exteriors of that scene were actually filmed in Galveston, but it apparently is supposed to be in Houston, since Travis on his second visit tells Jane the boy is downtown in room 1520 of the Meridien hotel.) In that first scene, Kinski is totally iconic on the screen, pure soul. I do not like the sentimental and unlikely ending, however, which has Jane re-uniting with the son, and suddenly ready to take him with her and take care of him. Not bloody likely, I say. He has a much better home waiting for him back in Los Angeles with the uncle and his wife (Stockwell and Clement). And I did not like Kinski's lengthy speech during the second visit, in which she mainly says, over and over to Travis, I kept on hearing your voice. I felt the movie stop dead during that speech, and it was the only time I looked at my watch. After's Travis' speech in that scene, he should just tell her where the boy is and leave the booth. Other endings are possible too, especially if you feel, with me, that Hunter cannot end up with Jane.
