However, I have not really seen anyone offering other movies that were more deserving.  This is mostly because Titanic was one of, if not the best, movies of 1997.  Remember that the Oscars are given for individual years and not for all time.  1997 did not provide many stand-out movies, with the exceptions of Titanic, Good Will Hunting, and L.A. Confidential. Personally, my vote for Best Picture would have gone to Good Will Hunting, but, I cannot blame people for thinking that Titanic was the best picture of 1997, because, quite frankly, what else was there?Another thing that bothers me is that many people say that the storyline is horrible, dialogue is bad, etc.  Did Titanic get nominated for Best Screenplay?  No, it didn't, so it doesn't make sense to me that people would complain about that, since the Academy obviously recognized better stories than that of Titanic.  The same holds true for DiCaprio, and I will admit that, in my mind, Winslet and Stuart probably shouldn't have received nominations, either.Perception of the movie is vital to the viewer's opinion.  If a person goes into Titanic looking for a love story, that person is sure to be disappointed, because, in my opinion, the love story should be viewed as secondary, or complimentary, to the sinking of Titanic.All in all, I feel that Titanic is definitely not one of the best ever, but certainly it is one of the best of 1997.

It is Oscar-worthy. Cancer has become so much part of our society that people often forget that it actually kills. This movie is about one woman's journey to understanding and love because of her mother's illness.

When I first saw it, I had a luke-warm reaction. But, over time, it's really grown on me--no pun intended ;-). The more I see it, the more I appreciate it. The writing is top-notch, as is the acting. Throw in a few surprising cameos and good direction, and you end up with a great little film.It's also good to finally see Hank Azaria get a chance to shine in a starring role.

Perhaps the plane scene takes that much flak because it's not cutting edge technology where you have the luxury of technical leeway. Anyway, it got the movie off to the kind of start we expect from a 007 movie. I love Pierce Brosnan's version of Bond. I've heard criticism that he's not physically large enough, but I think that he has a very deceptive physique, and they scripted him to have Bond-like strength, so it didn't matter that much anyway. I did enjoy the special effects, as outlandish as they were. The plot-line was solid enough for a Bond movie. There were holes, but no gaping holes, just minor ones. I loved Joe Don Baker as Jack Wade; I was glad to see him back in Tomorrow Never Dies. All in all, a great Bond flick.
