But what is important here is that IT works!This is one of the rare movies which gets better with multiple viewing. I saw this movie on TV, I saw it because of Spielberg and Tom Cruise. What a combination! The movie is set in 2054, and the technology showed is spectacular. The discs, the computer screens, eye scanners, helicopters, cars, etc everything was very interesting and believable. The concept of the movie is very original and thought provoking. The way Anderton does his job is amazing. The first part of the movie is an introduction for us about how pre-crime works. Slowly the story takes a roller coaster ride and keeps the audience glued to their seats. The story is very intriguing. Direction is fantastic. The part where Agatha leads Anderton to escape the cops is very very interesting. And there are many other interesting sequences throughout the movie including some twists. The concept of echo and minority report is very thought provoking. And the concept of seeing the future and having a choice to make a wise decision is very interestingly showcased.Overall this is a no-nonsense movie. Very high on intellectual and technical level. But the problems I personally have with this movie are that it sometimes looks dull because of the background texture, Tom Cruise was like a puppet in the hands of Spielberg throughout the movie, it was difficult to connect with him because he dint show any expressions on his face, even in the action sequences. Agatha had performed well but was very irritating at times. Background score could have been better to add to the intensity of the drama. So the presentation of the movie was not good enough. Much like a bitter tablet which does its work but has bad taste. These are IMO the backdrops of the movie. But like I said it works!Overall I rate it 9\/10.

It's a biopic that does nothing else but telling you all of the right required information you need to know about Malcolm X.So it's a biopic and nothing more and nothing less really. You could say that this is enough, since it simply serves its purpose but I prefer a biopic with a clear story to it, that features a beginning, middle and end that are all connect and not a movie that chronicles the life of a person, through fragments. Or maybe at least something that makes the movie 'spectacular' and memorable to watch. Nothing about this movie stands out really. It remains on the safe side of things and I never felt really involved with the movie or any of its characters. It was like I was watching a moving history book. And again, there is nothing wrong with this but not the type of approach for a biopic that I prefer seeing.But really, the movie does a good job at telling you the life story of Malcolm X. When you are too lazy or incapable of reading a book and documentaries perhaps aren't your thing but you would still like to learn about Malcolm X; this is a good way to do it! Personally I knew very little about him, which I realized all the more after finishing watching the movie. I'm glad I watched it and feel more enriched now. And even while that the movie is almost 4 hours long I'm sure that the movie left a lot of things out, deliberately or not, I feel like it did a more than great job at covering all of the fundamental things you need to know about its subject.The one foremost thing I now especially respect Malcolm X for was that he made black people proud of their color and race, which also taught them to stand up for themselves and show them that they are worthy of all things that are great.It's definitely a well told movie. After all, it's over 3 hours long, yet it never starts to feel overlong or tiresome. It probably is because the movie is always moving. It doesn't linger too long on just one particular period of Malcom X's life and is being set at lots of different locations. It never becomes a movie that drags or slows down too much in any way, which is a real accomplishment for a movie this long. Spike Lee deserves lots of credits for that!The movie gets almost entirely carried by Denzel Washington, who earned a well deserved Oscar nomination for his leading role as Malcolm X. Even though he doesn't look very much like the real Malcolm X, he still convincingly becomes him through his acting and the love and passion he puts into his role. No doubt that a lot of the people involved shared a love and passion for its subject, which shows in the movie. You might question its objectivity because of that at times but it still makes this a good and more than maintaining movie to watch.The movie also does a great job at capturing all of its different time periods, which the movie is taking place in. The movie also still manages to maintain one style throughout, which lets the movie feel like one big whole.Well, I thought that I could be short about this movie but it seems like I failed at that.

A lot of the second movie looked like it was ripped out of the first movie and refurbished. Some of the scenes were almost exactly the same and made me feel like I was looking at the first one again.There is hardly any story to be found in this one. 'The book of the dead is found again and by listening to the tape recorder, the Evil is released on earth and tries to murder everyone brutally.' Where have we heard that one before right? All of the actors are very bad and I was really annoyed about how naive they were. The movie was predictable in many ways and even tough a lot of horrors have naive main characters this one was just ridiculous. They were running all over the place and there was no plan whatsoever. There was some hysterical shouting overall, but little emotion was showed by any of the main characters. There are only a few things I can praise this movie for At first there are the great props, costumes and make-up. They look really great and make the movie watchable. People who have watched the first Evil Dead will know what i'm talking about. Second there is great camera work in this one, comparable to the first movie. It's very recognizable and gives an aery touch to the movie. If you've seen the first Evil Dead and are looking for a lot of the same then i suppose you should check this one out.

My favorite was Ghost Rider, but after watching Spawn, I couldn't decide over who was better overall. Spawn is an anti-hero comic book character created from the mind of Todd McFarlane. As for the movie, I was hoping for it to be a little more than just satisfactory. And the only thing I can really say that doesn't negatively criticize it, are its visuals.Spawn is the story of an ex-assassin, Al Simmons, who was left for dead after his evil boss, Jason Wynn, burned him in an explosion. Its not until he is brought to hell and made a deal with Malebolgia to become the leader of Hell's army. Simmons is portrayed by Michael Jai White, and Wynn by Martin Sheen. White was a good choice for Spawn but there were some times where he sounded like he was growling more than talking and it just became tiresome after a while. Sheen was an interesting choice as the villain because of his acting style. Sheen is very smooth and it never seems like he's out of step with his character.One character that is less tolerable than the others, is The Violator, played by John Leguizamo. It's understandable that Leguizamo was only acting out the personality of The Violator, but it felt like every time he was on screen, it was just another drawback. Almost like Leguizamo's character was supposed to be stealing the spotlight. Not to mention that The Violator wasn't even that funny to begin with; just a nuisance. The action was good in this film. Of course, that's when Spawn was busy trying to get vengeance, which wasn't all too often. Half the time, Simmons was trying to get in touch with his past, which wasn't ever successful. The other issue was that Spawn didn't learn know how to really control his powers until the very end of the film. And as all origin comic book adaptations go, the superhero figures out how to control their superpowers quickly, but for Spawn, it takes an awful long time. But despite all these flaws, the visuals and special effects are the greatest things about this movie. The costume of Spawn is spectacular. Bright lime green colored eyes, a black suite of armor and a cloak that can be used as camouflage or to enhance anything he wields makes Spawn an awesome superhero. Another plus is how Spawn can form metal objects from his body. Even his costume has a mind of its own! It's a neat trick. The sounds are cool listening to as well. Hearing how Spawn morphs his skin can get the skin crawling. Also the Violator in his true form was cool to see in the real world as well. What I couldn't understand was the transition between the real world and hell. Whenever the screen is focused on hell, I felt like a video game simulation and not a movie. Another thing I would've like to see was Spawn being a rated R film; PG-13 just didn't seem like the right tone for this kind of story. The musical score was produced by Graeme Revell and sadly I didn't feel much from it either. There was music but no emotional connection. Todd McFarlane's comic book adaptation has ensnaring visuals and some decent action sequences but is weighed down by an unsupported soundtrack and a slow moving script. Viewers may also be turned off by Leguizamo's obnoxious character role.

Hearing how Spawn morphs his skin can get the skin crawling. Also the Violator in his true form was cool to see in the real world as well. What I couldn't understand was the transition between the real world and hell. Whenever the screen is focused on hell, I felt like a video game simulation and not a movie. Another thing I would've like to see was Spawn being a rated R film; PG-13 just didn't seem like the right tone for this kind of story. The musical score was produced by Graeme Revell and sadly I didn't feel much from it either. There was music but no emotional connection. Todd McFarlane's comic book adaptation has ensnaring visuals and some decent action sequences but is weighed down by an unsupported soundtrack and a slow moving script. Viewers may also be turned off by Leguizamo's obnoxious character role.

At first I was skeptical &#x96; It's never a good way to start the movie with showing a character pee an a person even in a raunchy one but I guess it was the creators way of saying No, this is not for kids, since an animated movie NOT for children was something new back then&#x85; Actually I must give the movie some credit for being the first one to do it. I guess it's easy to criticize this movie today since we all scene stuff like this in South Par, Family Guy or Drawn Together so there is nothing shocking about this kind of stuff anymore. Any way after first five minutes I was actually starting to like the movie. While all the raunchy humor was done much better in the books (more tasteful in a way) the movie had still some good, unique atmosphere to it and I like the way it mixed different Fritz the Cat stories. Yhe, the sex stuff was over the top, I didn't care much for the two pig police man who try way to hard to be funny and I would prefer if some of the action scenes where more like in the book - simple. Still the movie had some great mod and abstract atmosphere, some of the new humor made me chuckle (for example the scene of three student girls talking with the African-American crow and trying to impress him how much liberal they are while he just stand their silent) and while not the best of Ralph Bakshi films I was still growing to like it&#x85;Then we got to the last third and the Fuzz Bunny character was re- introduce. Here I will start with the SPOILERS for both the book and the movie. Well, in the book the whole point was &#x96; students are idiots! They do nothing but smoke path, drink, have sex all the time and talk pseudo- philosophical stuff that have no impact on the world whatsoever&#x85; In the book there is a point where Fritz meet his friend Fuzz who join some sort of a liberal anarchist movement who is planning to blowup the bridge. It's not some scary, sinister organization. It's just four idiots sitting in a room and talk how their hate rich people and want to rebel. Fritz and Fuzz attempt to blow-up the bridge but they screw it up acting completely clues about the situation. This was one of my favorite part of the book and comedy came out from the way those guys where nonchalant abut their whole terrorist plot. While Craps book satires liberal students it didn't picture them as evil, simply as misguided and full of ambitions that lead nowhere. But sadly, while the first 3\/4 of the movie is pretty faithful to events in the book, when it get to this part if becomes the flip side of the coin. Fuzz is no longer an streetwise guy, now he's some psychotic, sadistic drug user named Blue. The group of pseudo-philosophical students lead by some insane hippy guy turns into a dark religious cult located on a cemetery with sinister looking members and even use some Fascist symbolism. Fritz is no longer suppose to blow-up the bridge with his buddy but instead is meant to blow-up the nuclear power plant with an female lizard character who turn out to be truly evil and In the end Fritz changes his mind about the whole thing. Not only it takes a very comedic story and turn it into something scary and violent, but it demonize the radical left wing students. Maybe Bakshis point was to make the whole thing more dramatic to provide an exiting climax but for me not only it's completely ruins the spirit of the book but it feels to be out-of character for the movie as well.Overall I enjoy parts of it and I still find this movie to be an interesting , unique and artistic interesting experience but if you're fan of the book you maybe strongly disappointed by the ending.

Basically Professor Immanuel Rath (Emil Jannings) is the esteemed college preparatory high school educator who has punished many of his male students for spreading around the image of beautiful stage performer Lola Lola (Destry Rides Again's Marlene Dietrich). He hopes to catch the school boys in the cabaret club The Blue Angel, where she is the headlining act, and after her for himself he grows slowly passionate for her, and with a pair of panties snatched by a student he has a good reason to return there the following night. Having had a night of desire and such, Rath returns to class next day, with the Principal (Eduard Von Winterstein) furious to see the students running riot, and he is aware of the teacher's behaviour recently as well. He decides it is best to retire from the school, and with his newfound freedom he can marry Lola, but they cannot stay happy for long as their money problems grow, and to earn he is forced to become a stage clown in the cabaret troupe. Rath is often filled with jealousy and lust for his wife and her profession, she leaves herself open as a shared woman, and he is being ridiculed for his past while performing as a clown. He performs his last act at The Blue Angel, and he is shocked to see Lola kissing her new love interest strongman Mazeppa (Hans Albers), and his rage turns into insanity, where he starts strangles his wife and is forced into a straitjacket. In the end, having been released from prison, Rath is not able to resolve his position as a school teacher, and he has obviously lost wife Lola, so he dies from extreme self pity clutching the school desks that once sat his loyal students.

I watched the film as a class study of Greek mythology, and I'm proud to say the source material hasn't been tampered with THAT much..First things first great animation. For a 1997 film, the landscapes were beautiful to see, and this is a person who's seen all the CGI-made films nowadays. My favorite design was the hydra, who seemed 3D-like. They did a great job visualizing the characters and their designs, almost making us forget the fact they were, in fact, animated. Second things second the music. At first glance, you would never know this is an adventure slash musical film. I really enjoyed the gospel singers and the songs snipped in from Hercules and Meg. They were nice to hear, and the gospel singers enhanced the stories by adding a new form of narration. Third things third the plot. This is where the film falls apart, for me, because the writers obviously try to lean towards their initial audience. They stripped away some of the Greek mythology by trying to make it a family film, but they end up stripping too much away. There was some clever jokes packed in, especially dozens of pop- culture references, but none of them made up for the fact that they took too much away. Bad things stop there. Hercules was a very fun film that doesn't take too much away from becoming a fraud. It packs in clever references to Greek mythology, packs in lush animation, and packs in a key item in animations heart. I recommend for anybody wanting to see a film that can still be enjoyable albeit forgetting some of it's source material.8\/10.

This first chapter in the series (fourth released film though) is perhaps the least popular with 'STAR WARS' fans but it's the most successful of the series financially and well liked by the general public. I really enjoyed the film (even being a 'STAR WARS' fan) although I have the same problems with it most fans do (I hate Jar Jar Binks and wasn't impressed with the casting of Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywaler) but it's still a lot of fun despite it's flaws. Probably the most true to the original series of the prequels.This prequel is of course set decades before the events of the original three films when Anakin Skywalker (destined to become Darth Vader) is just a young boy. The Trade Federation is attacking Naboo (a peaceful planet) with plans to take control of it. While confronting the leader of the Federation, Nute Gunray (Silas Carson), two Jedi Knights, known as Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), are attacked. They escape and head to Naboo to warn the Queen there (Natalie Portman) of the Trade Federation's evil plans. They flee together to Tatooine where they meet Anakin. Right away Qui-Gon knows he's important.The movie is classic Sci-Fi and a great action adventure film. Some feel that writer\/director George Lucas (performing both duties for the first time since the original film) geared it too much towards kids (rather than the now adult original fans) but the movies were always supposed to be kids films.

Some might find silly or annoying the fact of seeing the Soviet cop always better,always smarter and always stronger than the American cop, who is more like a clown filled with unfunny jokes.

And for a Walter Hill movie this was quite light, not much violent (or not making it so impressively) and filled with lots of dialogs.Part of our fun in watching Red Heat is seeing the Governator posing like a Russian officer, so superior but giving some funny moments.Cast also includes Peter Boyle, Gina Gershon, Laurence Fishburne, Richard Bright and Pruitt Taylor Vince, all in good supporting roles.Man, I miss movies like this.

Most of the film is about covering the strange partnership between the detective of the Capitalist nation and the tough captain that comes from the Comunist Russia, their cultural differences and different ways of treating their criminals, and the usual fights and shootings. A real fun to watch if you're not much demanding. Some might find silly or annoying the fact of seeing the Soviet cop always better,always smarter and always stronger than the American cop, who is more like a clown filled with unfunny jokes. Others might enjoy the fact of a simple action film foreseeing the collapse of the Communism, three years before the real act. And for a Walter Hill movie this was quite light, not much violent (or not making it so impressively) and filled with lots of dialogs.Part of our fun in watching Red Heat is seeing the Governator posing like a Russian officer, so superior but giving some funny moments.Cast also includes Peter Boyle, Gina Gershon, Laurence Fishburne, Richard Bright and Pruitt Taylor Vince, all in good supporting roles.Man, I miss movies like this. Those were the good days for watching such classics. 9\/10 ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"15 May 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I think it goes without saying that television is everywhere, even when it's not even on. And we can also say that television is purely about ratings, who can get the highest ratings and how many will tune in? Sidney Lumet's eerily prophetic 1976 hit Network is about the lunacy of the world of television and mass-media, and those behind-the-scenes doing the programming. With top-notch performances from every big-name performer involved, things get rolling when long-time UBC anchor Howard Beale (the late Peter Finch, who received a posthumous Oscar for Best Actor) soon learns from the top brass that he is being fired due to low ratings. On his next broadcast for the network, he announces that in one week he will be committing public suicide live. Rather than have him pulled off the air, the top executives in charge decide to let him stay on the air, and his on-air rants soon become legendary and an instant ratings success. Behind-the-scenes, Beale's best friend Max Schumacher (William Holden) engages in an illicit affair with the unscrupulous program manager Diane Christianson (Best Actress Oscar-winner Faye Dunaway) who will do anything it takes to keep Beale on the air. This is a powerful, top-notch film. Prophetic doesn't even begin to describe Network; all you have to do is look at reality TV, Jerry Springer, Charlie Sheen, and God-knows-what-else to see that Network means more now than it did in 1976. This movie is scary, funny, and dangerous. Howard Beale was right We're all humanoids, but we're not mad and we're taking some more!10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 May 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I think it goes without saying that television is everywhere, even when it's not even on.
