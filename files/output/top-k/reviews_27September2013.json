Nearly 2.5 hours.Reviewers here talk about the futuristic look of the film, and that's true. And it is impressive, but there are also reference to other ages - - the Pharaohs of Egypt...the Tower of Babel, etc. In the end, it's the art deco artistry that makes it still appear fresh.The story is sort of dumb. Have and have nots. Same theme Obama plays day in and day out and the agenda has really gotten long in the tooth.The acting is rather wooden to be quite frank, and surprising considering this was made in 1927, not 1917. By the time of the beginning of the sound era, silent film acting learned to be natural, not stagy. But stagy this is for the most part and it really detracts from the power of the film.For example the make lead over acts so badly that it's actually hard to watch him when he's on the screen. The make up used is also over done and surprising for the year. Once again, it takes away from the power of the film.In the end, the film's message is dated. Capitalism won, get over it. Still, the look of the film is what brings you back. Not the acting and certainly not the story line. It's all about the artistry of the sets and back drops. But 2.5 hours? Is there a Cliff Notes version?And just an aside. In these types of films, -- the ones that take an overtly leftist point of view, why are the male protagonists always so effeminate? The guy in this film should be wearing a dress.If the acting was better, the characters more interesting than cardboard cutouts, and the story not so heavy handed in the way it was told, I would have given an additional 2 stars, but I just couldn't. It gets a six. ","genre":null},{"date":"27 September 2013","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Extraordinarily long movie -- especially for a silent film.
