While I know I might be alone on this, I couldn't help but be completely in love with this film and the delightful way the story unfolds.  For the last 8 years, I have resisted Sandra Bullock.  I could not stand her constantly annoying performances in such dreadful films like `While You Were Sleeping' and `Time To Kill'.  Then, last May, Bullock starred in `Hope Floats'.  It was in that film that I could see Bullock had a real talent, and she could act pretty well when she actually had to.While in `Forces' the old goofball Sandra shows up, she really won me over with a sharply emotional, and yet very funny performance. Her and proven comedic talent Ben Affleck make a very smart team.  They both share a grand sardonic sense of humor, and can easily bounce off each other without ever breaking the rhythm of a scene. I will state unequivocally right now that if you find either Bullock or Affleck too smarmy or unpleasant, stay away from this film.Director Bronwen Hughes impressed me 3 years ago with her upbeat and lovely `Harriet The Spy'. Ms. Hughes has a real visual gift, and she chooses some wonderful shots here, some maybe even a bit poetic.  I look forward to her next movie. The film is shot beautifully, and the director wisely chooses long lingering shots of supporting actress Maura Tierney's face, a face that is vastly entertaining.I will admit that this story of two strangers who fall in love isn't the most original thing ever, but the material works this time. It will always work when the strength of the talent is this strong. I recommend this film highly, and I defy anyone to predict the ending.

The alienation and isolation of the suburbs come across beautifully in this film.  Car culture and sprawl definitely contribute to the empty feeling one receives from following this story of a rich suburban housewife's allergic reaction to her vapid life.  The mood and statement of the film are epitomized by the scene in which Carol is driving alone on the freeway, going into convulsions from the fumes, all while the scratchy radio produces mundane religious babble.  Ironically, she pulls off the road and is saved by the confines of a parking garage.  How appropriate based upon the pigheaded tendency for urban planners to say, Boy, this traffic is horrible, what do we do about it?  I know!  We'll build more parking garages!  The scratchy babble of religious radio in the scene indicates the hypocritical irrelevance of spirituality when it exists as part of a alienated consumer-driven, environmentally-destructive society.  Religion, particularly the new-age movement seems to parallel the suburbs in its pretty blandness and emergence as a way for capitalists to try to redeem their souls\/family life after destroying society (eg the inner city).  New age and suburbia combine when Carol goes to Wrenwood (a place even more sterile and removed from reality than Carol's suburb), a healing retreat for people with environmental illness.  Despite a lot of fluffy, positive talk on behalf of an AIDS victim guru, Carol's physical and spiritual condition only decline at Wrenwood--she becomes more and more like Lester, the faceless guy in the white suit (the perfect new age suburbanite) who is afraid of everything and is expected to die based on that fear.

This movie so entertained the viewer, as it did fascinate, and inform. A chilling, disturbing, and revealing look into the mental institutions as seen through the eyes of a con. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd, round out the excellent, and very well casted cast.Jack Nicholson brilliantly plays Randall Patrick McMurphy, an ex-con, who fakes being mentally insane, to enter the institution. As he goes to the hospital, he doesn't realize, that the people, and the atmosphere there is so out there. The patients are really psycho, and creepy. Randall, must try and survive these days, before he has to go to Jail. He has to entertain himself while at the same time, find good in this place of craziness.Lousie Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched, a soft; but strong willed nurse, who will not take anything from anyone, or put up with misbehavior. She watches Randall, and notices something different about him, he's not as psycho as the others, but he is a little out there. Her job is tough indeed, having to put up with all these men, who don't listen, some go crazy and throw fits, and others just sit there and don't do anything.Randall meets many new friends in this place, Brad Dourif who plays Billy Bibbit, is a mentally unstable, but voluntarily institutionalized person. Danny DeVito plays Martini, a slow but charming and sweet man, who means know harm in what he does or say. Christopher Lloyd plays Taber, a man, who also voluntarily institutionalized himself. He also meets Chief, a big 'dumb, and deaf' Indian, who happens to like to play basketball. Randall must try and survive these days with his new friends, and the hospital, as well as an everlasting war as to which they can watch the world series on TV. Put up with Nurse Ratched, and the other patients, doctors, vistors, and nurses.

I will admit that it doesn't necessarily give us a story that we haven't seen before, or give us a Clint that we failed to notice previously, but the acting is so top-notch and the story is very well-paced, it's very hard to knock this film. Clint is a journalist for an Oakland paper who is famous for turning print media into crime-solving reports. He is also far from saintly, sleeping around with various women of assorted age groups (one of them happens to be his supervisor's wife), and of course, he drinks up a storm. Amidst all these turn-offs, he still has the guts to prove that a young black man (Isaiah Washington, in a fine performance) is not guilty of killing a convenience store clerk in cold blood. He has less than a day to prove it because, it so happens, Washington is to be executed by lethal injection at San Quentin by a minute after midnight, that very night! Sound familiar? What does work very well in TRUE CRIME is the way in which the film is paced. Clint cuts right to the chase, giving us just the facts, keeping the suspense taut throughout the whole film, and maintaining our interest. His cast is well chosen as always. Washington is a fine new talent, doing an effecting acting job here. James Woods appears in a few entertaining scenes as the head editor of the paper, humorous and stylish as usual. Denis Leary, very subdued this time, is Eastwood's protege. Frances Fisher even turns up briefly as the district attorney who handled Washington's case six years before. TRUE CRIME is a good thriller, told with quick pacing, effective acting, and good direction as always by Eastwood. The only major problem I have is that it doesn't provide us with any new plotlines or intricate complications. But then again, how often do we get something like this from Hollywood anymore? It is certainly not a lot. Rating Three stars.

The title alone is brilliantly written, obviously by Robert Rodat, but the title doesn't really even begin to match the movie's over all breadth and scope.  Yes a hodgepodge of war-versed soldiers enter into heavily German infested French countryside and find many little happenstance adventures along the way to Ryan, but that is not what this film 'wants' to be about.  The long extended scenes of pure adrenaline horror, was an exercise in realism by Spielberg, never sophomoric, but absolutely true in its depiction of terror while in combat.  In past attempts at 'experiencing' film terror, or as Alex from Clockwork Orange would say, Vidying terror, I viewed some 8 or 9 snuff films known as the 'faces of death', and my memories of those grisly scenes coincided at times in SPR.  One scene in particular, when Tom and his men are clinging for dear life on bullet ridden sand dunes, and the camera frenetically shifts back and forth between screaming characters, then captures Tom pulling over a man with his face caved in. I swore at that moment that I had seen something similar in faces of death.  Scenes like this, or Cpt. Miller kneeling on the beach with stream of blood trickling down his face as soldiers engulfed in flames try to carry on fighting, or Medic Wade vaingloriously claiming to have 'stopped the bleeding' as a bullet rips thru the soldier's helmet, remind me of the gritty atrociousness not only in movies, but in life.  Yes, real life.  The opening of Ryan, not the Normandy beach opening, but the Normandy cemetery is very poignant.  Line after line of white marble headstones, extending into the vanishing point, and the bereaved veteran humbled into silent weeping in their presence.  Then, another genius stroke of Spielberg, the camera dollies slowly into the veteran's deep transcendant eyes,  and then the crash of waves into the rusted hedgehogs; saltwater ebbing and flowing cautiously thru its iron legs.  Although, as I watched SPR, the critic in me couldn't completely be astonished by  the 'warrior poetry'.  I saw Spielberg draw influences from such directors as Kubrick, De Palma, Kurosawa, and even Tarantino.  One scene, I think borrows heavily from True Romance, a movie written by the feverishly popculture zeitgeist genius of Quentin Tarantino, in which the soldiers are locked in a Mexican standoff with equally surprised Nazis, chaotically yelling profanities at each other.  Peckinpah I think would be especially proud with the usage of chameleon-like and unexpected violence and gore.  There's one scene in The Wild Bunch, Peckinpah's answer to the 7 samurai, in which a bank robber's horse wobbles and then crashes through a plate glass shop window, whilst the camera frenetically weaves between slow and fast motion.  In the final battle in SPR, this Wild Bunch scene re-emerged in my mind when a bomb blasted soldier hurdles thru a shop window ala Peckinpah.  There is so much to write about this movie that it would take several days and nights to fully begin to encompass its creative inputs.  I'll leave with one final comment;  I think the final battle was a homage to Stalingrad, one of the last and greatest sieges in military history, where Nazi and Russian soldiers battled it out tooth and nail in the bomb hollowed city and in such odd places like wine cellers, church bell towers and antique shops.  Saving Private Ryan definately does it justice.  ","genre":null},{"date":"19 March 1999","score":"","review":"  Saving Private Ryan.
