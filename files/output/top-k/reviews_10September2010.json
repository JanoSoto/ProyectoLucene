I've seen many of his movies. That being said, I was very impressed with Mulholland Drive, but I don't think its quite his best film. It is well-made, but I believe The Straight Story and Blue Velvet are his best movies. Both of these movies lack the depth and complexity of Mulholland Drive, but I think I prefer the director's straightforward style of film-making over his fragmented style. All the same Mulholland Drive is one of his better movies, if not his third best after Blue Velvet and the Straight Story.Mulholland Drive is a strange film. The whole movie is very dream-like and surreal, qualities that enhance the film very much. It also has exceptional acting, and very good directing. Just the fact that David Lynch could pull off such complicated storytelling proves his talent as a film maker. The story and plot of Mulholland Dr. are actually very simple on the surface, but it is told in such a way as to make the viewer think.Mulholland Drive takes place in Los Angelos and there are many characters in the film, but it focuses mainly on three characters a young aspiring actress named Betty, and brunette named Rita, and a director named Adam who is trying to make a movie. The three of these characters' stories are told separately, but their lives eventually come together.The main conflict in the movie is between Rita and Camila. Rita meets Camila in an apartment. Rita has just been in a car accident and cannot remember who she is or what she is doing. Rita and Camila soon become friends. Camila feels like she should help Rita. She talks to her and tries to sort things out. But Rita is very confused, much like the audience. Camila wants to star in Adam's movie, but Adam does not approve of her.The relationship between Camila and Rita is very intriguing. It is what helps keep the movie going. The movie takes a while to get into, because it starts off rather slow-paced, dark, and convoluted. Some people won't like this. They would prefer a movie more lively and easy to follow. Although this film mostly comes together by the end, it still leaves a lot of unanswered questions. This is the neat thing about the movie though; it gets you thinking. I analyzed the movie and tried to sort it out in my head for about a week after I saw it.Some people may ask, Should you really have to do all that for a movie? Shouldn't it just be about relaxing? And yes, this point does have merit. There is a fine line between difficult to follow and baffling. But movies like this provide people with a lot of fun to come up with different theories of what really happened. Mulholland Drive has many strengths. It has excellent cinematography, talented storytelling, good acting, and has a very good soundtrack. Mulholland Drive's strengths far outweighed its weaknesses, but all the same the movie did have its flaws. For one, it left a lot to speculation but didn't leave much to the imagination. This movie has graphic sexual content that may ruin the movie for some people. It didn't bother that much but the movie still could have had a little more subtlety. My one true gripe with the movie was that it was a little too grim. The amusement in this movie is slim to none. Blue Velvet is for the most part a pretty serious movie but it still includes comic relief. Mulholland Drive could have used a few light-hearted scenes, just to help loosen up some of the tension in the movie.I understand that the dark atmosphere was supposed to help tell the story. The ominous nature of Mulholland Dr. was appropriate for the story, but at times it was a little overwhelming. The movie comes across as a just a bit too stark because of this. The movie was also a bit confusing towards the end- it could have used more editing, and could have had more focus on the protagonist. As cool as the switching from one story to the next was, we never really got to know our protagonist, played by Naomi Watts, very well. In fact, probably only half the movie included her. Mulholland Drive is a movie that most people probably wouldn't fully understand the first time around. Upon its first viewing there are a few evident flaws in it, but I think its one of those movies that would be much better the second time. The first time you;re so busy trying to figure out what the heck is going on that its hard to really enjoy it. Overall, I would recommend Mulholland Drive to anyone who likes David Lynch. Fans of the directer, and fans of artistic films will probably like this movie. As for everyone else, this movie is not a crowd-pleaser. Its not the most enjoyable movie either. The style of the movie resembles that of a nightmare and it is rather depressing. Although it does leave you feeling enlightened, it may also leave you feeling a little gloomy. But it is an original and imaginative film. And it has transfixing visuals, skillful directing, and strong performances.

Many films of the kind can be good if they provide an interesting plot, story or something that makes the picture stand out in one's mind other than tedious boredom. For example I thought the movie Heat was boring for the most part, but there was a major scene in the movie that saved it completely the bank robbery scene. That scene was probably one of the most intense and expertly executed action sequences I have ever seen. Another example is The American. It was another pretty boring movie except for a scene in the middle and its devastating ending. Those two scenes, and especially the ending, not only salvaged the movie, but took it to a completely new height. However this movie in my memory had just a documentary type bore throughout.

It also plays an important role in Chinese film industry as well. Thus, it won awards in different areas, such as Silver Lion for Best Director in 1991 Venice International Film Festival, Best Foreign Language Film nominations in the 64th Academy Awards and Zhang Yimou was the first mainland China person to attend the Oscar (Wikipedia, 2008). In fact, this is an ordinary story of five women and one man in 1920s feudal China when it was common that a rich man had more wives. It uses women's voice to tell how unfair women's position was in feudal China. Due to her father's death, Songlian (acted by Gong Li) is forced to drop out of school and marries an elderly landlord (acted by Ma Jingwu) to become his fourth mistress. During the first night, she gets her feet massaged, and all red lanterns lit, and chooses delicious food for their mealtime. Gradually,she finds not all the mistresses can get special treatment, only the one who spends the night with the master can. Every woman in the courtyard, even her personal maid (acted by Kong Lin), fights with each other to win more attention from the master. In this fight, women lose almost everything, even their lives. However, at the end of the story,the Master marries a young woman again as his five mistresses, and fight between the women still go on&#x85; There are some special designs in the film. In Su Tong's (2004) original novel, there is no light lamp, and massage. In order to give us a huge impact in vision and hearing, the director adds red lanterns and the sound of pounding feet.Secondly, there is no spring in the film. The story happens in summer, and then it develops into autumn and winter. In the end, the story goes straight to next year's summer. Spring is a season which gives people hope and energy. The implication is that women in a feudalist society have no hope. Thirdly, there are no close-up pictures of the master. Even in the end, we can not see what the master looks like, although he is the main actor. It makes whole film more horrible. Incisive and appropriate language is the one of the important features in the film. Songlian said, In this courtyard, human beings look like the dogs, cats, or pigs, but never like human beings. The third mistress (Hei Saifei) said, I am putting up a play, our lives are plays. We fool others when we play well. We could fool no one but ourselves when we play poorly. From these words, we can understand not only the characters of the people; we can also know how bad their lives are.Some plots are unsuitable for a Chinese family in high position in1920s. We can see in the film, Zhang Yimou uses the red lantern as a clue- who spends the night with Master is the only one who can get a massage and get the lantern lit. In order to light the lantern, every woman fights with each other. Deeply influenced by Confucianism, there are a lot of Li or rules in a big family. So using the lantern as sign of who gets the 'glory' almost can not appear in a traditional family. Like Lu (2007, P. 159) said, foot massage, ordering dishes at the family table, and raising lanterns&#x85;these rituals are portrayed as originating in the 'ancestors rules', although they are just as exotic for Chinese audiences as for Western ones.. At the same time, the third mistress hangs several Beijing Opera masks in her bedroom and her bedroom becomes more like as stage of the Beijing Opera. Again it is not suitable for Chinese 'Li' in house decoration. On the other hand, in a traditionally rich family, they care about Feng-shui, so the decoration in the family will all be square.

It also plays an important role in Chinese film industry as well. Thus, it won awards in different areas, such as Silver Lion for Best Director in 1991 Venice International Film Festival, Best Foreign Language Film nominations in the 64th Academy Awards and Zhang Yimou was the first mainland China person to attend the Oscar (Wikipedia, 2008). In fact, this is an ordinary story of five women and one man in 1920s feudal China when it was common that a rich man had more wives. It uses women's voice to tell how unfair women's position was in feudal China. Due to her father's death, Songlian (acted by Gong Li) is forced to drop out of school and marries an elderly landlord (acted by Ma Jingwu) to become his fourth mistress. During the first night, she gets her feet massaged, and all red lanterns lit, and chooses delicious food for their mealtime. Gradually,she finds not all the mistresses can get special treatment, only the one who spends the night with the master can. Every woman in the courtyard, even her personal maid (acted by Kong Lin), fights with each other to win more attention from the master. In this fight, women lose almost everything, even their lives. However, at the end of the story,the Master marries a young woman again as his five mistresses, and fight between the women still go on&#x85; There are some special designs in the film. In Su Tong's (2004) original novel, there is no light lamp, and massage. In order to give us a huge impact in vision and hearing, the director adds red lanterns and the sound of pounding feet.Secondly, there is no spring in the film. The story happens in summer, and then it develops into autumn and winter. In the end, the story goes straight to next year's summer. Spring is a season which gives people hope and energy. The implication is that women in a feudalist society have no hope. Thirdly, there are no close-up pictures of the master. Even in the end, we can not see what the master looks like, although he is the main actor. It makes whole film more horrible. Incisive and appropriate language is the one of the important features in the film. Songlian said, In this courtyard, human beings look like the dogs, cats, or pigs, but never like human beings. The third mistress (Hei Saifei) said, I am putting up a play, our lives are plays. We fool others when we play well. We could fool no one but ourselves when we play poorly. From these words, we can understand not only the characters of the people; we can also know how bad their lives are.Some plots are unsuitable for a Chinese family in high position in1920s. We can see in the film, Zhang Yimou uses the red lantern as a clue- who spends the night with Master is the only one who can get a massage and get the lantern lit. In order to light the lantern, every woman fights with each other. Deeply influenced by Confucianism, there are a lot of Li or rules in a big family. So using the lantern as sign of who gets the 'glory' almost can not appear in a traditional family. Like Lu (2007, P. 159) said, foot massage, ordering dishes at the family table, and raising lanterns&#x85;these rituals are portrayed as originating in the 'ancestors rules', although they are just as exotic for Chinese audiences as for Western ones.. At the same time, the third mistress hangs several Beijing Opera masks in her bedroom and her bedroom becomes more like as stage of the Beijing Opera. Again it is not suitable for Chinese 'Li' in house decoration. On the other hand, in a traditionally rich family, they care about Feng-shui, so the decoration in the family will all be square.

Up until then, the darkly lit and grim crime stories were the domain of American directors--such as Jules Dassin--the man who actually directed Rififi. In the late 1940s and very early 50s, he made four of the best films Noir had to offer--Night and the City, The Naked City, Brute Force and Thieves Highway. So, it seems that he was THE link between the two cinemas--bringing the best of American Noir and fusing it with French sensibilities and actors. In a sad way, it was a GOOD thing (at least for cinephiles) that the Black Lists forced Dassin to relocate to Europe to make films (for more on this, by the way, watch the interview with him that's included as an extra on the DVD).I was surprised when I saw one reviewer referring to this film as an early example of French New Wave. I didn't get this at all--it clearly was like Dassin's American films in most every way--except, perhaps, it tended to possibly glorify criminals in a way his earlier films had not done and the budget was lower. This film just doesn't look like that of famous New Wave directors like Truffaut or Godard--and I am happy about this, as New Wave did NOT work well with Noir (a great example is the failure of Godard's Alphaville as Noir--it just didn't seem at all like any Noir film unless you are taking LSD while viewing!). Perhaps it IS a lot like the French director Melville's films in many ways--and I am sure Melville was influenced strongly by Dassin.I would say that Rififi is among the best Noir films ever--and probably the best Noir France has to offer--and that's saying a lot, as I often prefer the French Noir films--they are THAT good. That's because even more so than the American versions, the criminals are incredibly cold and scary. Because of this, there was a wonderful realism. Instead of the often bigger than life criminals in the American versions, the French ones were more restrained--and as a result more believable.So what is so wonderful about this film? First, there are so many wonderful caper films (such as Bob le Flambeur and Grand Slam)--yet this is THE best of them. Second, the caper itself was brilliantly handled. Having thirty minutes of dialog-free action without music really, really heightened the tension and was riveting. My deaf daughter usually hates this sort of film, but she sat transfixed as well. Third, the ending was wonderful. It was very dark and free of sentimentality and it also was tense and well-made--and it's hard to imagine anything better. Fourth, the film is just perfect--there is NOTHING I can thing of that I would change! About the only Noir films I might like better (and this is hard to say for sure) might be The Killers....maybe. It's also a film that cinephiles must see...period.By the way, look closely at the Italian thief in the gang--that's Dassin himself. He did act in a few movies here and there in addition to directing--and his most famous acting role was probably in Never on a Sunday (in which he co-starred with his wife).If you liked this film, some other wonderful French crime films would include Bob le Flambeur (which, in many ways, is a re-tooling of Rififi), Le Samourai, Un Flic and Le Circle Rouge (all by Jean-Pierre Melville), Le Balance (sort of an early 80s reinvention of Noir) and even Diva (yes, it's NOT Noir but has many Noir qualities).

We don't get many of these classic, retro, 80's and 90's style black movies anymore like we used too. The latest one that crosses my mind at the moment is the recent Lottery Ticket that, judging from the film's trailer, has the style, humor, and looks of a Friday film (with Ice Cube not as Craig) and some other similarities I won't dig into at this time. Though it undoubtedly wont surpass the humor brought by Ice Cube and Chris Tucker in the 1995 Comedy, it will most likely bring cute one liners and have an essence of the feeling while being it's own thing.Kid 'n Play and DJ Jazzy Jeff\/The Fresh Prince were icons and the rap duos way back in the 80's 90's. They are the true definition of hip-hop with their amusing, yet cheesy music videos, and energetic beats combined with clever lines in their songs. We even get the memorable and respectable rap battle between Kid n' Play which is the film's ultimate turn for the best. We get some of the most fluent rhymes and a beat (composed by Martin Lawrence) to satisfy as well. It's definitely the most energetic point in the film and without the had the most thought put into it.Kid n' Play play are themselves with a simple plot amongst them. Kid wants to go to a party held by Play, but after a run in with the school bully, his father Pops (played by the late Robin Harris, whom died nine days after the release of the film) prevents him from going and makes him remain in the house all night. Kid sneaks out and heads to Play's party in hopes of having his way with the girl, or girls, of his dreams. The one thing in the way of his dreams is the school bully and his two goons trying to make Kid sorry for his accidental run in in the lunch room.It's a simple story, but to my surprise, the movie is not all about the house party as the title, cover, and storyline would suggest. It's actually a heartfelt, meaningful story about friendship, love, and doing what you think is right. When introduced to Kid we are given the misleading impression he is a goodie-goodie kid with nothing on his mind that would ever lead to trouble. Instead when the movie picks up we learn Kid's wild side and the antics never stop when they start.Another thing very cool about this film are the colors. Bright, vibrant texture is put to the test here and the colorful and artistic blend work well in creating a very unique setup. Also with the classic hip-hop tracks constantly played in the movie, it's almost feels like one 100 minute musical\/music video, since most videos back in the 90's had a cheesy, colorful set with energetic music and a track with sensible lyrics. Overall, House Party is definitely a party. With the all star African American cast, enjoyable songs, vibrant colors, and a retro feeling to top it off, it's the ultimate party movie, and Kid n' Play are the icing on the cake.Starring Christopher Kid Reid, Christopher Play Martin, Full Force, Martin Lawrence, A.J.

It's definitely the most energetic point in the film and without the had the most thought put into it.Kid n' Play play are themselves with a simple plot amongst them. Kid wants to go to a party held by Play, but after a run in with the school bully, his father Pops (played by the late Robin Harris, whom died nine days after the release of the film) prevents him from going and makes him remain in the house all night. Kid sneaks out and heads to Play's party in hopes of having his way with the girl, or girls, of his dreams. The one thing in the way of his dreams is the school bully and his two goons trying to make Kid sorry for his accidental run in in the lunch room.It's a simple story, but to my surprise, the movie is not all about the house party as the title, cover, and storyline would suggest. It's actually a heartfelt, meaningful story about friendship, love, and doing what you think is right. When introduced to Kid we are given the misleading impression he is a goodie-goodie kid with nothing on his mind that would ever lead to trouble. Instead when the movie picks up we learn Kid's wild side and the antics never stop when they start.Another thing very cool about this film are the colors. Bright, vibrant texture is put to the test here and the colorful and artistic blend work well in creating a very unique setup. Also with the classic hip-hop tracks constantly played in the movie, it's almost feels like one 100 minute musical\/music video, since most videos back in the 90's had a cheesy, colorful set with energetic music and a track with sensible lyrics. Overall, House Party is definitely a party. With the all star African American cast, enjoyable songs, vibrant colors, and a retro feeling to top it off, it's the ultimate party movie, and Kid n' Play are the icing on the cake.Starring Christopher Kid Reid, Christopher Play Martin, Full Force, Martin Lawrence, A.J.

We don't get many of these classic, retro, 80's and 90's style black movies anymore like we used too. The latest one that crosses my mind at the moment is the recent Lottery Ticket that, judging from the film's trailer, has the style, humor, and looks of a Friday film (with Ice Cube not as Craig) and some other similarities I won't dig into at this time. Though it undoubtedly wont surpass the humor brought by Ice Cube and Chris Tucker in the 1995 Comedy, it will most likely bring cute one liners and have an essence of the feeling while being it's own thing.Kid 'n Play and DJ Jazzy Jeff\/The Fresh Prince were icons and the rap duos way back in the 80's 90's. They are the true definition of hip-hop with their amusing, yet cheesy music videos, and energetic beats combined with clever lines in their songs.

With a budget of $100 Million Lethal Weapon 4 was considered the weakest in box-office return and critical reaction but in my opinion I consider it better then Lethal Weapon 3.With both Sergeants Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are getting older and whilst still causing damage in Los Angles there can do less physical fests. Both men's families are expanding, Rigg's partner Lorna (Rene Russo) and Muztagh's daughter Rianne (Traci Wolfe) are pregnant and both are them are promoted to captain. At the same time they investigate people smuggling by the Triads led by Benny Chan (Kim Chan) and Triad enforcer Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li). With the aid of young police sergeant Lee Butters (Chris Rock) and private investigator Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) the two set out to bring down the Triads who are putting people into slavery.Like the first three films there is strong chemistry between Gibson and Glover, with good comic timing, particularly in the beginning when a nutcase in homemade armour, a flamethrower and a machine gun is causing a lot of damage. But the two are getting older and it was clear that a stunt double was being used more often and there were jokes about their ages. It was also good that Gibson cut the Three Stooges stick and his character was more serious and down to Earth With the rest of the cast there Chris Rock was decent, offering his motormouth style of comedy and he is a much better then many American comedians like Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dane Cook. He is better stand up but he is a decent actor and he is also good as playing a straight, serious character as well. Jet Li was excellent as the villain, both as a material artist and as a sinister threat, the real mastermind of the plot. Pesci's character also improves from the annoying being he was in Lethal Weapon 3, but his character still doesn't add anything to the film.Richard Donner keeps the stunt work of the first three films and there are some excellent sequences, especially involving Jet Li's fighting ability. There are good gun battles and a excellent car chase on the freeway which was done with traditional action techniques. The scene involving the nutcase was also fun. But some of the action became more over the top, with bad guys missing with great skill with AK-47s whilst the good guys can shoot really well in the dark and at distance with pistols. Other examples are when Riggs uses the laser sight of his gun to bounce a bullet into the back of a Chinese guard, considering that's not however a laser sight works and Riggs and Murtaugh drive through a building without killing anyone and then jumping back onto the freeway. Another examples are when Riggs shots the back of a nutcase in his flamethrowers fuel supply and he ends up flying into a fuel tanker and a oil drum flying into the air into Murtaugh's boat. But Donner is a good action director and when it's done right it was great to watch.There is a good use of a Chinese score in the film, adding to the atmosphere. Donner does have good pace in the film and the script does have some fine ideas, like counterfeiting Chinese currency and human trafficking. But some elements are just fillers like the car chase when in the end the officers question Uncle Benny for information. Like the first film the henchman takes over the organisation. Also the ending is cringe worthy with Lorna giving birth, with an unfunny scene where Lorna and Riggs getting married by a Rabbi (it more funny that we all know Gibson is a raving anti-Semite) and a sentimental ending about family which only Americans can do in a vomit inducing way.The film is worth watching simply because of Jet Li.

Of all his thrillers, this one could easily be considered the most ambitious. Ironically though, it is ambition wherein the biggest problem lies. This grizzly science-fiction thriller carries the burden of a heavy story; one that is convoluted, and questionable. there are too many characters and the ending feels overlong. To put it more charitably, The Fury certainly demands a viewer's attention. Though very much low-brow, it is not a film for the weak of mind, and is in no way a film for the squeamish. De Palma's greatest quality is his knowledge of how to work with and manipulate imagery. The camera work, editing, and art direction altogether turn the Fury into an opera of a horror film. It is bold and assertive and very visceral. If the story doesn't penetrate your mind, the picture certainly will. Its suspense factor is so-so, but it knows how and when to make the viewer jump.Kirk Douglas is an exceptional actor, but not in the Fury. He does a reasonable job of balancing quirkiness with aggression, however, it still feels like a b-movie performance. Amy Irving takes that a step further. Her performance is pure b-movie, equipped with stiff, uptight delivery. Most of her acting here is done through her face. It's a very nice face, but it is often subject to miss direction. As good as he is with the camera, De Palma is not so good with actors. If I didn't know better, I would say his instructions to Irving involved little more than playing the 'make a face' game (look scared, look shy, look brain dead)Gore is not usually scary, but The Fury comes close to proving otherwise. There is a fair amount of blood in the picture, and it gets spilled in very particular ways, (not like what happens when people lose limbs, except for one moment) I won't describe the details because that would spoil a bit too much.I enjoyed the movie. It blends horror, thriller, and science fiction together quite effectively.

This movie has no shame and no boundaries. You simply won't see no-holds-barred love (and sex) scenes like these in a mainstream movie anymore. It's wall-to-wall fun and excitement and an awesome date movie. It brought me back to the 80's L.A of my wasted youth. I loved the sights, sounds, colors, the neon, the crummy neighborhoods, the classic cars (somehow, Jesse always manages to find some one-of-a-kind classic to steal whenever he needs a ride) and the junk man's pinwheel hat! Richard Gere has never been more exciting, before, and definitely not since (since he became Saint Richard). Here, he's expanding on his hustler character in Looking for Mr Goodbar. Where are the great exploitation movies? Fun, stupid movies have become a dying art, ever since the end of the Roger Corman era. Nothing made today approaches this kind of fun and insanity. No one in today's conservative Hollywood would have the guts to produce something like this. Just because this film isn't heavy or meaningful, doesn't mean it isn't totally awesome! And the Rockin' soundtrack is worth having all by itself Jerry Lee Lewis, The Pretenders, X and 50s and 80s classics you won't hear anywhere else (I was amazed to hear Link Wray's Jack the Ripper, a cult classic instrumental).

It was amazing, the two hours seemed like 20 minutes. I personally don't like when plays try to be catchy through swearing, but this one took my breath away. The anxiety was crazy, even though I knew there were only three actors playing I still expected another character to appear. I believe this is a masterpiece, but not for anyone. You have to understand the typologies created in order to enjoy them truly. I agree that it is better played on stage rather than in a movie. However, even in the hall me and my friends seemed to be the only one enjoying it. Nobody else was laughing, many thought of it to be boring and very obscene. That was when I realized that not everybody knows how to see the greatness in the really incredible things. So kudos to whoever knew how to enjoy this movie\/play!

The acting was terrible, and all the characters were unlikeable and generic. Also the plot was weak and derivative of many other zombie movies, without nothing of originality.

Dirty Harry has never been a big fan of the media, but Clint certainly makes an exception in her case.The Dead Pool also has a short, but memorable performance by Jim Carrey early in his career as a punk rocker whose overdose death also coincides with his appearance on The Dead Pool. It was obvious Carrey was going to have one substantial career even from this small bit.I don't think The Dead Pool is quite up to the standards of the earlier Dirty Harry films from the Seventies.

What, do you expect there to be a 15 minute short film before this explaining who Qui-Gon exactly is, Obi-Wan, the Trade Federation, etc. This film is more political than the original trilogy because, even though they are great films 4, 5, and 6, they are not with the exception of 5 in my opinion, as adult as this one. People complain about the plot, but its actually fairly simple. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are assigned to protect the Queen of Naboo because the trade federation who is working with the Sith are trying to kill her. Along the way on Tatooine, they find Anakin Skywalker and free him. Sure, the plot could be better and isn't as good as say...all the other films, but it isn't terrible. The special effects are ten years ahead of its time and there is plenty of eye candy. The action scenes are surely the best of the six films in my opinion, and the final battles are easily the best battles in Star Wars. Only reason it isn't my favorite and is a 9, is because of and I'm sure all you Star Wars fanatics agree Jar Jar Binks. Enough said there.
