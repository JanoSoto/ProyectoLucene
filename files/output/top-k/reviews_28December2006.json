I think the casting was great, all of the fellowship and everything. Everybody just looks right (except the brown haired elves, but that is for later) It moved a little slow, so it is not appealing for everybody, but if you make it through you love it.But there are some flaws. For instance, i don't know if this is Elijah wood or peter Jackson, but frodo was not so wimpy. Frodo becomes more scared and weak as the ring takes over, but he wasn't so confused and out of it in the book. Also, i think a major part in this is when he was stabbed and was sick, when Liv Tyler came along and saved him. In the book he actually rode the horse himself and was much more awake and he said if you want me , come and take me not Liv Tyler saying if you want him come and take him (i know very nit-picky but very strong point) Also on the subject of Liv Tyler, i don't think she should have had any lines at all, since in the book, she doesn't talk. All it says is (paraphrased) look Aragorn there is the elf princess and Aragorn told the hobbits the story, but never says it is about him. so all of her scenes should be gone. not to mention she had BROWN hair?? if i remember correctly from LOTR and the Hobbit, elves are blonde.Also this is also either actor or director, but elrond is not supposed to be really intimidating. HE is supposed to be more of a grandfather type character, but still stern. (not to mention the brown hair) But yet again i love this movie, there were many things that were cut out, but i would rather watch a 3 hour movie than a 7 hour movie.

It is completely entertaining, and is worth watching. But i think that Spiderman does have some major flaws. For instance, I think Kirsten Dundst is HORRIBLE, not . just as Mary Jane, but in general. She is an OK actress, but she always looks like she is either falling asleep, or completely possessed. And i don't think she knows the meaning of posture. I think if opened her eyes stood up straight, takes some more technique based acting, she would be just wonderful. Too bad though.Tobey Macguire is fine, he doesn't seem as strong minded as i thought he was, more of a superman. Also his faces when he is running over buildings just really make the movie amazing because they are so melodramatic and over the top its hilarious.I of course love James Franco, but i think his character was a little pointless, i know they needed to lead up to him hating Spiderman and such, but he seemed just so weak and sallow most of the time, instead of this strong school boy.The scripting some times was a little ... cheesy. Especially some of the goblin's lines, not that i don't think Willem Dafoe is a great actor, I think he had to work very hard to make his character not a Power Ranger.I am very glad that they did do some back ground, though there was a little much. I personally did not know the back ground story of Spiderman, though i know many people do, i thought it was interesting to know. I just thought he was Spiderman because he was, not so much of the spider biting and his uncle and stuff.Also the CGI sometimes is great and sometimes is HORIFIC! As i watch the movie i get very confused because i think i am watching a cartoon.

To this day, it stands as one of the finest examples of British comedy and, more particularly, about how television sitcoms become so popular. It was, and is, an excellent example also of self-referential cinema.So also Soapdish, a film I'd never heard about until a few nights ago when I caught it on late TV. I was a bit dubious at first simply because comedy is so difficult to do well, as you know.However, I was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very clever satire about daytime American TV. In fact, it's been a while since I laughed so heartily. So, if you like satire, I'd recommend you see it.The main actors &#150; Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty &#150; quite simply do an excellent job, revealing just how bitchy and shallow the business of acting is. As I watched it, I kept thinking to myself just how much of this bitchiness carries over into real life? That is, if actors ever do have a real life? As you probably know, Peter Sellers, for example, was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters, so that nobody really knew the real person. So, as I watched Sally Field playing Celeste Talbot playing Maggie, I thought again about that earlier British film with Kay Kendall playing Laura playing a character in a TV sitcom opposite Peter Finch...Is it any wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns? And that feeling was crystallized when Celeste finally confronts her daughter (Lori, played by Elizabeth Shue) and, in an emotional moment, repeats the fictional lines she'd used, on a prior episode of her daytime soap, when confronting her fictional daughter in that show! Are you confused? Well, it's not all like that, but the dialog is stunning for originality, comedy, bitchiness, anger, depravity, duplicity, and even...love.The story? Well, there are many stories in this film, all interwoven, and which all come together at the end (of course &#150; but not like a Robert Altman film, okay!), and not all of them are resolved finally. Life's not like that anyway, right? The pace is almost frenetic, and you really do have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the sight gags and subtle jokes. Spend the 97 minutes from your life and watch it; you won't regret the time usage.The rest of the cast all perform well, although I've never taken much to Whoopi Goldberg. Perhaps the funniest exchanges are between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty and, for my money, the latter steals so many scenes from others, she gets my vote as the outstanding player.

Going into it, you can tell that I thought it had a lot to live up to. Its reputation had become pretty big and I think that if it were any other film, it wouldn't have worked. That's right, I loved this movie.It opens beautifully and simply with a wedding. We see and get to know each character through their conversations with the others and their reactions to everything that's going on. That environment brings out the true emotions of these people and the movie really couldn't have done it in a better way. It was a brilliant decision to start the film with something that would show us exactly what we're getting into and what the filmmakers are setting us up for.We are then led to the everyday lives of the characters. They're steelworkers, hunters, husbands, and friends. They're your friends. They're the people YOU know, the people YOU love. The film goes so far in depth that it seems as if YOU are a character as well. You feel what they feel and you believe what they believe. You're taken in by these average Americans and you live their lives.Having just made so many friends while in Pennsylvania, you realize what the movie is about to do to you.

It builds everything up to the point that you know and love each character. you actually CARE about each character so that when something tragic happens, it's the end of the world.

SAMSON AND DELILAH and David AND BATHSHEBA quickly come to mind, but even the more respected TEN COMMANDMENTS was, despite all the hype, a pretty lousy film--with cardboard characters and silly writing. Even QUO VADIS was a pretty uninspired film, despite the violent nature of the film. So, in light of this, I am so happy to say that a Biblical epic CAN be exceptional and worth seeing! What makes BEN-HUR so worth while? Well, of course the film does contain some of the very greatest (if not the greatest) action scenes of all-time. You just can't do better than the unbelievable chariot race sequence for excitement and spectacle. Even the naval battle scene is great despite it being filmed with large models--it's state of the art for the time it was made. In addition to the spectacle, it also handles the religious aspects of the film in a less heavy-handed manner than most of its contemporaries. You do see Jesus from behind throughout the film and you do not hear him speak--instead, the film focuses on Jesus' teachings on others. And, while they do not show the resurrection, you are not left with the impression that he stayed dead like the 1925 version--a definite No-No for a Biblical film! Now as for the acting, it was generally exceptional--especially from Steven Boyd, Jack Hawkins and Hugh Griffith. I also liked Charlton Heston in the title role, but I could see how some might see this performance as a bit more wooden. Also, there are times (especially at the very beginning and end) where the pacing is just too slow.

The fans would have it no other way, and even if they would have allowed some maturity or depth anywhere in the vicinity, you're still be stuck with the same actors, characters and spaceship escapes setup.I watch a lot of 50's science fiction and marvel that we took much of it seriously at the time. All these Trek films have now moved into a similar zone of campiness.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

He is organising an expedition to the island to document the Dinosaurs there & to try to save them from his money grabbing nephew who now controls the company InGen. At first Ian refuses but once he learns his girlfriend Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is involved he's in, along with photographer Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) & filmmaker Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) they all travel to the island. However they are soon joined by Hammond's nephew, a big game hunter named Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite) & a load of heavily armed men who are there to collect some Dinosaurs in an attempt to resurrect the idea of a Dinosaur zoo this time in San Diego...Directed by Steven Spielberg The Lost World Jurassic Park is the follow up to Spielberg's phenomenal monster box-office hit Jurassic Park & isn't as good as the original but is still a decent & perfectly entertaining effort. The script by David Koepp & was based on the novel 'The Lost World' by Michael Crichton which I haven't read but the two apparently share little in the way of similarity. The thing that hurts The Lost World Jurassic Park in my opinion is that the script is so loose, it has little focus & relies on nothing more than another group of scientists & people who want to exploit the Dinosaurs having lots of coincidence's conspire against them which leaves them all trapped on an island with loads of killer Dinosaurs for company. It feels very similar to the original but somehow even less, there's nothing of any substance, there's nothing that drives the story forward & Spielberg gives us yet another highly annoying kid, the scene where she kills the Raptor was easily the worst part of the film for me. I hate annoying kids! The character's are OK but Postlethwaite's hunter character is all tough to start with but by the time the film finishes he's repented! He should have been the main villain, instead they turned him into a bleeding heart liberal who gets dumped from the film totally about 20 minutes before the end never to be seen again. I sill thought it was decent, it moves along at a nice pace & the climax where the T-Rex stomps it's way through San Diego is cool even though it feels like it's been edited in from a completely different film.Director Spielberg does a good job, the special effects are top-drawer as one would expect & there's some great moments. Whenever the T-Rex's are on screen the films pretty cool, the climax in San Diego is a great sequence as is the part where the truck gets pushed over the cliff & everyone is left dangling inside. There's a few effective scare moments & the set-pieces are very good. There's a touch of gore with people being eaten, there's a severed hand, someone is bitten in two & a couple more scenes which may not be suitable for the youngest of viewers.With a supposed budget of about $73,000,000 & it made nearly $93,000,000 on it's opening weekend, technically it's top-notch & is as well made as anything out there with plenty of big budget Hollywood polish. The acting was OK with Goldblum standing out, I won't mention the annoying kid.

There are reasons for this, while ROBOCOP 3 isn't as bad as it's reputation would have you believe, it's still a far cry from the first two films entertainment value. The problem here is, is that the film's over the top violence that permeated the first two is almost non existent, it seems that the PG- 13 rating behind ROBOCOP 3, severely straight jackets the film-makers from going further with the carnage & bloodshed. The fault of this does not belong at the feet of film-maker FRED DEKKER & the production crew, but rather the then financially burdened Orion Pictures executives who demanded that the film be watered down to a PG-13 rating in the hopes of gathering a much more wider audience than the first two films & thus opening the door for bigger & better financial returns, this ultimately proved to be a big backfire for Orion, because not only was ROBOCOP 3 critically panned by both fans & critics (it's listed in the top 30 worst sequels of all times list according to Empire magazine) but it drove away it's target audience that flocked to the theatres in droves to see the first two & teenage & pre-teen audiences didn't bother to go see it either, with the few who did see it calling it trifling & boring, causing the film to be a financial flop & in an ironic twist, Orion executives wound up helping to killing off their own money making franchise! Another big drawback is the fact that almost none of the same people who made the first two (sans FRANK MILLER who helped pen the second film & a few of the actors) return here. Dan O' Herlihy has moved on as the chairman of OCP, even Peter Weller is missing in action, replaced by ROBERT JOHN BURKE, who actually fills the role of Robocop quiet nicely & was a close enough match to make for a possible replacement for Weller & puts in a very fine performance as the films hero. The gore & heavy violence has been heavily toned down as most of the action usually consists of lighter fighting scenes, explosions & shooting, not to mention a few car chases. However these scenes are few & far between & mostly occur in the first half hour & last twenty minutes of the film, in between the action set pieces, the film is utterly dry on action & Robocop spends the vast majority of the middle of the movie completely damaged & out of action.I will say this though, despite it's many drawbacks, ROBOCOP 3 at the very least keeps it's story fairly simple, without adding to many subplots that go underdeveloped, which is one of the things I felt hampered ROBOCOP 2.

Pop culture was pushing the limits and changing the way many people on the drug scene were used too. The problems were being told through the news, the radio and the newspapers frequently. Then in 1996 an independent British film hit cinema, causing uproar, controversy, worldwide success, critical acclaim and even government mention, this film was called Trainspotting.Trainspotting is based on a novel by Irvine Welsh which charts the life of a bunch of non-existent losers who're living their lives to their supposed full on the Edinburgh drug scene. The film charts the issues of poverty, crime and anti-social behaviour that are still alive in Britain today and shows the horrifying problems of drug abuse that the public-eye attempts to be unaware of. The film exposes the bunch of nasty, yet somewhat hilarious group of stoner's lives and how Renton (Ewan McGregor) attempts to find a true meaning to his chaotic and miserable life.Trainspotting is not a film that will appeal to everyone; it's graphic, nasty and harrowing. Yet, it retains from wanting the viewer to stop watching and manages to hold you throughout the entire running time. A film's content can, in some cases occupy the film's story and make you lose any pity, affection or remorse for the characters. Trainspotting manages to disgust, while still informing the viewers of the problems from drugs.For a film that is so startlingly daring and distressing at times you'd be surprised that it manages to make its point so clear and authoritative. A factor that caused controversy on release was that the film is not afraid to say drugs are good at first, but then the film goes on to saying but it's not worth it because the side effects will screw you up forever. It's an excellent message and one that alerts any viewer not to ever go near drugs, yet people have ignored the true meaning of the film which is held within some of the horrific imagery and experiences. If there is one that film that will make you never want to take drugs its Trainspotting. It really will make you think twice and also help you understand why people do such repulsive and then why drug abuse is wrong. Trainspotting is not a film that is preachy, it says you have one life which you should use with care and how you should realise the consequences of your actions. So at heart Trainspotting is an unforgettable and mesmerising study of wasted life. It succeeds in making its viewers come out learning and understanding one of the world's many unpleasant problems.If you didn't see these characters going through such disturbing events the film would not have such a poignant message and one that shows so many devastating outcomes of the drug abuse. Trainspotting has many iconic and memorable characters that're acted out with the utmost sincerity, yet some remain oddly charming. The characters are hysterical at times and for a film full such shameful people you still manage to hold pity for their decaying lives as they spiral into a living hell. The characters are very complex, though at first they seem simple and you gain an indisputable understanding of every character for a film that only lasts 90 minutes. Trainspotting is a film that has been highly influential to cinema as a whole, sparking off many films to come out of the genre and some films even using the same visual delights. For example in Guy Richie's magnificent Snatch, the characters are introduced in a similar way to Trainspotting and this is just to name one of many influences. Danny Boyle is an imaginative director with a brilliant trademark style to accompany his films.A film like Trainspotting is extremely exhausting because of its disturbing and what could have been an unbearable explicit nature. Because the film is at times highly amusing and visually glorious with its matchless ambiguity you'll not want to turn it off, even in the most disgusting moments. Though the film is at times flawed in the plot structure and has a few plot holes, the cinematography washes over the viewer with a somewhat mind-numbing quality. The dialogue is brilliantly paced and laced with pop culture references, studies of British social class and haunting narrative from the almighty, career-launching performance by Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting's soundtrack is another high-point and remains entertaining, quirky and also flawlessly fitting to the scenes it accompanies.It's a film that truly lays bare the problems of youth and drugs, showing the genuine effects with the needed explicitly and yet remaining solid entertainment from the comedy factor. A true gem of British, 90s cinema which unflinchingly depicts the lives of the no-lives in their cruel and deceitful worlds they've climbed into. Trainspotting has heart and works as an educational roller-coaster of pure realism that still shocks and teaches viewers the horrific affects of drug abuse. Trainspotting is a film that will never leave you which is ironic considering it's about addiction and affliction. Trainspotting is a film that terrifies me and should succeed in making anyone want to keep clean. We all know drug abuse is awful, but Trainspotting succeeds in showing its viewers why.

Very much like Fanny from a few years ago which also had a French setting and came to the screen without its score. The Broadway cast album was a staple in my house and I certainly enjoyed the songs that Keith Mitchell and Elizabeth Seal and the rest of the cast did on Broadway.What made it more puzzling was the presence of Bruce Yarnell in the movie cast, the possessor of a really nice baritone voice, he played opposite Ethel Merman in the Lincoln Center revival of Annie Get Your Gun. That together with the fact Shirley MacLaine first made her mark in musical roles, in fact she had starred in the screen version of Can-Can the two years before.Well, according to the recent biography of Billy Wilder by Ed Sikov in fact this film started out as a musical. Somewhere there is some footage of MacLaine, Yarnell, possibly even Jack Lemmon and Lou Jacobi doing some musical numbers lying in a vault somewhere. Wilder said he thought the numbers slowed the pace of the story and midpoint in the film he just scrapped what he had shot and didn't bother with the rest.Personally I wish he had kept the numbers in, maybe it would have made Irma La Douce run too long. Who knows maybe we'll get to see them some day.Shirley MacLaine got an Oscar nomination for her performance in the title role. She's a good natured working girl who has the misfortune to get busted by the one cop in Paris who is not winking at prostitution on his first day on his new beat. That would be Jack Lemmon who for his honest law enforcement gets himself fired.That far from ends it as Lemmon falls for MacLaine and like he did in The Apartment sees himself as her savior. The rest of the film is the ridiculous lengths Lemmon goes to save MacLaine from her life of sin and debauchery. His one confidante is Lou Jacobi who plays Moustache the owner of a local bistro where the girls and their mecs(that's French for pimp) hang out. His role was originally intended for Charles Laughton.Billy Wilder has a well deserved reputation as a cynical observer of humankind and had some run ins with several Hollywood greats. But he became an unabashed admirer of Charles Laughton after working with him on Witness for the Prosecution. The tenderest part of that Wilder biography tells about how Wilder kept visiting Laughton up to the end discussing the part with both of them knowing it was never to be. Yet I wish Laughton had lived to do the part. It would really have been special.Bruce Yarnell's part is that of MacLaine's mec. His career too was tragically cut short by a plane crash that he was killed in later in the decade. Terrific voice, nice screen and stage presence, what a terrible thing to happen.Though I would have liked to have seen the musical, I can't fault Billy Wilder's production of Irma La Douce. The fact that this came to the screen at all was further demonstration of the Code finally being lifted from the backs of the creative. Maybe we will see a full blown musical adaptation of Irma La Douce some day. But that's another story.

It tells the story of Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner), a federal agent who vows to take down the notorious Al Capone (Robert De Niro). Capone is ruling Chicago's Prohibition-era streets. Violence along with bootlegging is everywhere. Ness is a firm believer in following the law, whether or not he agrees with it. Because of this dedication, and of all the lives taken by Capone, Ness decides to be the first officer to take action and bring the fight to Capone's doorstep. Yet, failed raids and harassment from the media lead him to make another decision; he needs help. Some nights later he meets Irish cop Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery). Malone is an aging, yet very smart police officer who finds himself dedicated to stopping Capone, and help Ness is his mission. You want to get Capone, here's how you do it if his man pulls a knife, you pull a gun. If he sends you to the hospital, send one of his to the the morgue. That's the Chicago way. This being one of Malone's lessons to Ness; it's a rough neighborhood, and you'll have to be rough to stop it. Ness, with his teacher and partner, decide to search out other possibilities. George Stone (Andy Garcia) is an Italian who has changed his name in an attempt to avoid connections with the mafia. He has chosen the right side of the law, and he wants others to know it. He is an excellent shot and both Malone and Ness like him. The last member is Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), an accountant for the FBI, who discovers he can be tougher than anyone ever thought. This is the story of a group of four men, the first of who decide to stand up to the crime wave lead by Al Capone. A great story it is.Much of the films events are based on the real life experiences of an actual group, nicknamed The Untouchables, who did bring the fight to Capone's doorstep. While many of the events are actual, there is still plenty of the film that was imagined. I will warn you that this film is probably not an accurate representation of the criminal underworld, but can be stylized in its storytelling. Is there anything wrong with that? Absolutely not. It's a new way of looking at a dark part of this country's history, and it makes for a very interesting perspective. Everything about the story is a blast. Written by David Mamet, the screenplay lets us look into the past in a very romantic way. The only reason this film is romantic, beautifully shot, and executed is because of Brian DePalma. He directed this film to greatness, and made this movie worth every penny; whether you are renting or buying this picture, and feel satisfied at the end, it is due to DePalma. Hats off to him.Extraordinary acting leads this old-fashioned movie to even greater heights. Kevin Costner, in a role where he was first unknown, pulls his job off in every way. He is likable and charismatic. We do know, however, that when his life and family is threatened, his methods can become intense. A very well-rounded performance from Costner. Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace is a great performance. He is not only funny, but just a great overall acting addition to this group. Andy Garcia, pulling off a career-making performance, lets us know why he should never be underestimated. Sean Connery is great here, scene-by-scene he knocks us off of our feet. This great performance garnered him a well-earned Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. Robert De Niro. We can't say enough about him. Ever. He pulls off one of the best performances of the movie as Al Capone. Not only will his bodily features remind you of Capone, but so will his behavior. There is one point where he smiles just like Capone used to do, and there is a scary similarity. A great, great job from De Niro. You shouldn't be surprised by that.In the end, everything works. The old-fashioned allure. The great directing. The great script. The great acting. All of these elements make this film a classic. A film that will go down in history, and is every bit worthy of doing so.

This great performance garnered him a well-earned Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. Robert De Niro. We can't say enough about him. Ever. He pulls off one of the best performances of the movie as Al Capone. Not only will his bodily features remind you of Capone, but so will his behavior. There is one point where he smiles just like Capone used to do, and there is a scary similarity. A great, great job from De Niro. You shouldn't be surprised by that.In the end, everything works. The old-fashioned allure. The great directing. The great script. The great acting. All of these elements make this film a classic. A film that will go down in history, and is every bit worthy of doing so.

It tells the story of Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner), a federal agent who vows to take down the notorious Al Capone (Robert De Niro). Capone is ruling Chicago's Prohibition-era streets. Violence along with bootlegging is everywhere. Ness is a firm believer in following the law, whether or not he agrees with it. Because of this dedication, and of all the lives taken by Capone, Ness decides to be the first officer to take action and bring the fight to Capone's doorstep. Yet, failed raids and harassment from the media lead him to make another decision; he needs help. Some nights later he meets Irish cop Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery). Malone is an aging, yet very smart police officer who finds himself dedicated to stopping Capone, and help Ness is his mission. You want to get Capone, here's how you do it if his man pulls a knife, you pull a gun. If he sends you to the hospital, send one of his to the the morgue. That's the Chicago way. This being one of Malone's lessons to Ness; it's a rough neighborhood, and you'll have to be rough to stop it. Ness, with his teacher and partner, decide to search out other possibilities. George Stone (Andy Garcia) is an Italian who has changed his name in an attempt to avoid connections with the mafia. He has chosen the right side of the law, and he wants others to know it. He is an excellent shot and both Malone and Ness like him. The last member is Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), an accountant for the FBI, who discovers he can be tougher than anyone ever thought. This is the story of a group of four men, the first of who decide to stand up to the crime wave lead by Al Capone. A great story it is.Much of the films events are based on the real life experiences of an actual group, nicknamed The Untouchables, who did bring the fight to Capone's doorstep. While many of the events are actual, there is still plenty of the film that was imagined. I will warn you that this film is probably not an accurate representation of the criminal underworld, but can be stylized in its storytelling. Is there anything wrong with that? Absolutely not. It's a new way of looking at a dark part of this country's history, and it makes for a very interesting perspective. Everything about the story is a blast. Written by David Mamet, the screenplay lets us look into the past in a very romantic way. The only reason this film is romantic, beautifully shot, and executed is because of Brian DePalma. He directed this film to greatness, and made this movie worth every penny; whether you are renting or buying this picture, and feel satisfied at the end, it is due to DePalma. Hats off to him.Extraordinary acting leads this old-fashioned movie to even greater heights. Kevin Costner, in a role where he was first unknown, pulls his job off in every way. He is likable and charismatic. We do know, however, that when his life and family is threatened, his methods can become intense. A very well-rounded performance from Costner. Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace is a great performance. He is not only funny, but just a great overall acting addition to this group. Andy Garcia, pulling off a career-making performance, lets us know why he should never be underestimated. Sean Connery is great here, scene-by-scene he knocks us off of our feet.

So many people take offense to them, when in the same episode they're offended about, they'll make fun of themselves. It's silly to take any movie offensively that is a comedy, unless there were blatant racism or homophobia, or those kind of socially unacceptable things to joke about, which these guys do push the lines on some of that too in other projects.This movie definitely mocks the LDS church, but I was Mormon when I watched it, I wasn't going actively, but I believed it, and I thought it was hilarious. Anyone who is LDS could see that almost every representation of the religion is completely inaccurate. For example getting married in a LDS Temple is mentioned in the movie as costing thousands of dollars or whatever, which if someone that is LDS follows the churches teachings, pays their tithing (the only money that has to be spent to my knowledge), and is morally on-point enough according to some fairly high-up church authorities. The only thing that an LDS member that is rational and open-minded might find offensive is the nudity and porn element, which is part of the story, but isn't actual porno. There is some nudity, but it is primarily a man's buttocks, or a woman's breasts.The bottom line is that this movie is funny, but you have to look at it light-heartedly, and take it for what it is. Comedy. The comedy is quite a bit different of a style of humor than South Park, you can see that the same people make it, but it's a completely different type of humor... So check it out, I highly recommend this movie, and I am very particular about movies, I've worked in a movie store, and I know a lot of film elitist's, and a lot of them like this movie.
