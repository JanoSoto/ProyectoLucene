In my opinion this film is dreadful. Characters are so poorly built up, the dialogue is so cheesy, the acting and direction seem just lazy and the story is terribly bland. Dantes had been 14 years rotting in a dungeon. Remember Valjean when he leaves prison in Tom Hooper's Les Misreables?? Well, that is more what a man would look like after so many years in a dungeon (actually he would look even worse). But what really changed in Dantes' face after all that time in Château d'If was his expressions and his eyes (he also lost a lot of weight), and that's what made people not recognize him when he returns as Monte Cristo. An actor would have to work very hard to develop such a change. I think Jim Caviezel is a good actor but I guess he did not even bother to try too hard in this film, since it was just an action, adventure blockbuster (as I said before, lazy acting).Also, Monte Cristo is not the polite party-boy displayed in the movie. He is a grim, dark, mysterious and eccentric powerful man who despises banalities. Monte Cristo is constantly rude actually, but mostly in an elegant and subtle french fashion. He is definitely not a good man, but he's not a bad man either. By the way, this is the biggest flaw in this movie in my opinion it's just another simple story of good guy versus bad guy. In the original the conspirators were not exactly bad people. Some of them were envious, others were ambitious and some were both. But for most of them it was a very hard decision to do what they did to Dantes and his father. But they did it and had to live with that (which was hard for most of them for some time - until they forget it like people usually do).Finally, Monte Cristo is a man full of hate and vengeance; people tremble inside when he's around. He has no love left in his heart; kindness is something that was completely taken away from him (I definitely did not see that in the character displayed in the movie). There is no happy ending here because this is not a happy story. But I guess a sad and dark story like that is not what people look for when they pay for an adventure film. People want happy endings and good guys marrying good girls and killing the bad guys and I'm fine with that, really. If some studio wants to tell this kind of story they can go ahead and do it, I don't mind. But it's nothing more than a scam to use the popularity of other people's work to attract the audience's attention.

The Story of Aliens is that Ripley, still haunted and traumatized after the events of the first film, is asked by her employers The Weyland- Yutani Corporation to take a squad of colonial marines to destroy a possible Xenomorph infestation there. The performances by everyone in the cast are compelling and memorable, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley who puts on one of, if not the, best performances I have ever seen on film. The sound design is also equally commendable; nothing is quite as memorable to me as the sound of a marine's pulse rifle firing, or the screeching of Xenomorphs. Speaking of Xenomorphs, I love the angle that director James Cameron took with them. We get to see more of the inner workings of their hive, how they think how they fight together, their thought process, how intelligent they can be, and just how dangerous they truly are. The story is kind of familiar (Believe me, the idea of being trapped behind enemy lines isn't exactly new here) but I think that it works to the films advantage. It takes some of those familiar themes and adds a whole new layer to them and makes them fit into the alien universe. Like the previous film it takes the familiar Good vs Evil and adds a whole new dimension to it. A connection of Vietnam can also be made to this film (If you are reading this, please don't start a flame war) I mean think about it We have over cocky, over confident, marines going into unknown territory to fight an enemy they don't quite understand, and are defeated by the enemy that uses unconventional tactics in battle. James Cameron even said that some of the designs (Weapons, ships, etc.) Were taken from the Vietnam War. The films also takes the uncanny high levels of tension from Alien and cranks it up to a thousand. The dialogue is some of the best in cinematic history, and the characters are great as well. Another thing that must be mentioned, I also really liked the relationship between Newt and Ripley. It is portrayed realistically and adds a whole new dimension to the character of Ellen Ripley. Don't worry, Newt isn't annoying or stupid for a kid. In fact, she is actually really smart and reacts with brains instead of brawn. Hell, she even helps save Ripley at some points. Aliens is a masterpiece. Great writing, special effects, amazing gripping story, good set design, great mood and tone, action, and horror all contribute to this being one of the best film of all time. F**k those that don't like this movie, whether or not Aliens is better than Alien can actually be debated till you're black and blue in the face.

Few films in the history of cinema have received so much negative critical attention. I remember that when the movie was released, critics lined up to tear it apart. Everyone joined the feeding frenzy--the film was too long, it was wildly over budget, and it was cut to pieces by the studio.However, in 2012, a new 216 minute director's cut was released. You still may not enjoy the movie. However, at least now you can see a coherent, logical film that is worth watching. The movie is far from a docudrama, although it's based on historical events. In 1890, in Wyoming, the rich ranchers with huge holdings decided to drive out the smaller ranchers. They hired a large group of mercenaries to carry out what became known as the Johnson County War. These mercenaries, referred to as the invaders, operated with the approval and support of both the governor and the U.S. President.Kris Kristofferson plays Sheriff James Averill, a Harvard-educated member of the wealthy eastern elite, who sides with the small ranchers. Isabelle Huppert plays Ella Watson, a prostitute, madam, and Averill's lover. (She is faithful to Averill in the sense that every other man has to pay her, but he doesn't.)The movie has some magnificent scenes, such as a fixed gun battle between the small ranchers and the mercenaries. There's also an amazing scene at a roller rink. The name of the rink is Heaven's Gate. (I checked, and roller skating was very popular in Wyoming at the time.)The lovely Isabelle Hubert has no hesitation about displaying her exquisite charms, frequently and fully.The chemistry between Hubert and Kristofferson certainly works on screen. (Either they really did care for each other, or they are such good actors that they could portray love in this realistic fashion.)My suggestion is to forget the hype, buy or rent the 2012 version of the movie, and judge for yourself what Cimino accomplished. The movie will work much better on a large screen, but if DVD is your only option, go for it. I think it's definitely worth seeing. (Personal note my wife and I agree about films about 98% of the time. Heaven's Gate falls within the 2% about which we disagree. She found it tedious, bloody, and too long. She would have given it a rating of 6. I gave it an 8. Fair warning.)

(I checked, and roller skating was very popular in Wyoming at the time.)The lovely Isabelle Hubert has no hesitation about displaying her exquisite charms, frequently and fully.The chemistry between Hubert and Kristofferson certainly works on screen. (Either they really did care for each other, or they are such good actors that they could portray love in this realistic fashion.)My suggestion is to forget the hype, buy or rent the 2012 version of the movie, and judge for yourself what Cimino accomplished. The movie will work much better on a large screen, but if DVD is your only option, go for it. I think it's definitely worth seeing. (Personal note my wife and I agree about films about 98% of the time. Heaven's Gate falls within the 2% about which we disagree. She found it tedious, bloody, and too long. She would have given it a rating of 6. I gave it an 8. Fair warning.)

It is not really that smart or original, but it is made to entertain, and I say it succeeds. The story is about Darryl Walker (Damon Wayans) who, after his grandmother dies, is fed up with all of the crime in the city. So he gets his grandmother's house coat and makes it bulletproof outfit. Now he is the low-budget crime fighter, Blankman, but not with out his brother Kevin Walker A.K.A Other Guy (David Alan Grier). Although he goes 95% of the movie without him. This is not the smartest satire or the funniest of Batman. Fortunately, it keeps you interested (well at least me anyway). It's humor does not really rely on writing, but more on slapstick (I love cleverly written humor, but slapstick works well too). In conclusion, this movie is not bad at all.

The story is basically the Jedi have to stop a trade corporation from doing something to a peaceful planet by some means that are never explained to us.Let me just come out and say it The movie doesn't make any sense. And the plot itself isn't exactly what you would call Interesting or Complex either. Like, why are we talking about trade routes in a Star 'Wars movie, who gives a crap? Like I understand that this has to lay the groundwork for the entire Star Wars saga, but that doesn't give it an excuse to be this boring. How is the acting? Not much better than the plot unfortunately. While Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor do good in their roles (With what they're given to work with), everyone else in the movie is AWFUL! Jake Lloyd is awful, Natalie Portman is hollow, shallow, and just boring to listen to, and Jar Jar is annoying as hell. And speaking of Jar Jar Why is he here? If you thought the Ewoks sucked... they still do, but Jar Jar is so much more annoying than those walking teddy bears ever were. He is clearly meant as comic relief, yet every joke he makes is the equivalent to a fart or crap joke. I don't find him racist, just annoying and by far one of the worst characters in cinematic history. However, I will say this about the movie The action scenes are really cool (What few of them there are) and the film has really damn good visuals. Like, seriously I give massive props to the effects team, cause the film is pure eye candy. This was the Avatar before there was well... Avatar. And the action is crisp and easy to follow and honestly, really thrilling (With the exception of the podrace, which goes on way too long and is not all that interesting to watch). The duel at the end between Darth Maul and the two jedi is a true sight to behold. However, there is way too much going on at the end You got the battle up in space, the battle between Dath Maul and the jedi, the queen attempting to infiltrate the palace, and the gungans fighting the droid army. The jedi duel should be in the movie, the infiltration should be in the movie, everything else should be cut out. And another problem with the end is they way they kill off Darth Maul, like it has no meaning cause we didn't even know who he was! At least with Boba Fett in Return of The Jedi we knew who he was and what he wanted, so despite his embarrassing death he remained badass, Darth Maul on the other hand goes out in the stupidest way possible, and we have no clue who he was or what he truly wanted?! Did he want revenge? Money? Power? We never find out. So yeah, while the film has impressive visuals and battle scenes the movie itself, with all of its boring political talk, shoddy script, and overall boredom it is easy to classify this as the biggest cinematic disappointment ever, though Attack of The Clones was so much worse than this.

Several others also believe they are responsible for Harry's demise, but who really is at fault? There is a dead body present throughout the entire film, but no sense of dread over one man's death, nor is there a preoccupation with how Harry ended up dead on the hillside, there is only amusement in the humorous reactions of those around it.

Now, as someone older than the protagonists, and as someone who grew up in that era of orange napkins and beige refrigerators, I'm very moved and astonished by it all. The writing is extremely subtle for a script filled with excessive situations. And the acting, especially by the main three people in the remainders of the central family, is really a marvel. Donald Sutherland is the father and his delicate handling of a man who is plumbing some difficult emotions is profound. He has to handle a wife who is crippled emotionally and a son who is just bursting out of a deep withdrawal. Timothy Hutton as the son is remarkable complex, and is a parallel in a way to Dustin Hoffman playing a dysfunctional kid in a dysfunctional family in The Graduate. Mary Tyler Moore is the mother and is sharp, cool, yet likable, belying a deep emotional void. She is especially chilling and revealing because her public persona through television was as a really well-balanced, successful, single woman in a fast changing America.This isn't a happy movie at all, as you can tell, and yet it's a joy to watch. Not only is it finely made top to bottom, with wonderfully felt direction from Robert Redford (himself, like Moore, at the top of his acting career), it is weirdly warm, too. You like these flawed people (most of them) and you really want a beautiful resolution, as unlikely as it is. There might be some artifice to the flashbacks of the boat disaster, but maybe we can forgive that as the simplification of memory. Otherwise the sets and air and pace are spot on.It's nice to note there is no Hollywood ending here, not really, and that's a relief, too. A wonderful film with very few weaknesses.

The light - this sick sepia tone and frequent colored glitches really make dizzy and vomiting. The plot is a meandering endless talk of the main hero, not interesting in a split second. Even the music - nay, it has no cohesion here, and only Wrote For Luck by Happy Mondays is OK. The film was supposed to be about bands? Nay, I saw no real bands - just a mish-mash of some trite clichés, awful concert cues, millions of 4-letter invectives and silly sex scenes. The Factory records? It never was depicted nice, too. Just a scanty account of some dialogs, shaky camera fights, more bad words and more booze. Well, I would not like to be in such Britain as in the film. I trued as hard as I could to follow. Hopeless. Meaningless trash, coarse language, endless talks, blurred camera work, very hazy plot and very slow development. Just bad.

I loved the first in this series but everything after that was forgettable. Also I'd heard that the first Halloween was originally planned as a sequel to Black Christmas (which I saw before seeing Halloween) so I'm not particularly attached to the Myers character. Consequently, I was quite happy to see a different story line and I totally understand that the Halloween franchise was always intended to be different stories. That's all OK by me.The problem is there's lots to find fault with in this movie. To take on the Myers-obsessed viewers and get them on board with a Micheal-less sequel, Halloween III really needed to be a stand-out effort. It needed an exciting plot, great acting with preferably at least one big star, fantastic screenplay, inspired\/near faultless directing and a gripping score.Halloween 3 only scores on a couple of those requirements. The musical score was decent and the plot had potential. It was a refreshingly original idea, especially at that time and took some bold steps in horror (eg the demise of a child). It could have been developed into a masterpiece in the right hands as either a seriously scary horror flick or a black comedy. Unfortunately it was not in the right hands so it wasn't anywhere near as good as it needed to be to overcome it's glaring obstacle to success.I did not like the main actor, he was wooden & at times, overly dramatic and never convinced me of anything he was trying to convey. But I did like the idea of a Doctor playing the hero trying to save the world. Problem is, they needed someone much better and more appealing & believable than him to play that role. The leading lady was pretty but doesn't have much acting range either. To be fair tho, the script doesn't really help them out. The villain was laughable. He was so hammy I felt like he thought he was on a stage with his neighbourhood theatre group.I sound like I'm slamming the movie but truth is I sort of liked it. There's a goofy charm about it, even the bad of it - and it has an unpredictability and uniqueness that is really fascinating. I loved the imaginative and unusual kill methods, camera work and the special effects. I did laugh at points where I wasn't supposed to (at least I don't think I was!!) but that's OK. I laughed when the alien popped out of the dudes chest in Alien so I have an odd sense of humor. There's a scene towards the end of the movie involving the leading lady that I think was supposed to be scary & horrific but I just thought it was silly and laughed a lot. The movie never really developed any sense of dread or suspense. None of the characters ever seemed particularly scared or even mildly wary (apart from the guy in the very first scenes. He was actually the most convincing of anyone). The actors weren't helped by the directing which somehow seemed to leach away any chance the movie had to develop an atmosphere or creep the viewer out.I would love to see this remade by someone much more competent because I think it has the germ of a brilliant movie. As it is the movie is just mediocre. Worth a look & good for a laugh but definitely belongs in the average range.
