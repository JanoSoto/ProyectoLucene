He is in position to give up one love for the greater gain of another. Kelly Preston is well cast as his girlfriend whom he first encounters having car trouble. While the leads pull through, the supporting roles are typical and flat mainly placed for cliché moments. Among them are John C.

Holly Hunter is single and working at a hospital. Danny De Vito is divorced after twenty-five years of marriage. He owes a large debt in which his job as an elevator bellhop doesn't satisfy. His brother wishes to help him at his bar but De Vito holds out hoping to excel elsewhere. Recently his daughter passed away, which leads to his encounter with Hunter. She pays off his debt thus leading to interesting encounters yet an obvious conclusion. Directed by Richard LaGravenese who bypasses clichés with style, despite the predictable formula that drives the ending home. Hunter and De Vito flourish with humour in tact. Hunter is searching for something new and De Vito is hoping to bandage the old and move on. They have a unique chemistry despite the fact that the outcome is obvious. Supporting roles are played by an ambitious cast with little to do. Queen Latifah plays a nightclub singer who strikes up a friendship with Hunter but despite the energy put into the performance, the role is more or less a prop added when the leads are separated. Martin Donovan plays Hunter's ex in what is typical and predictable as he tries to reenter her life. Entertaining and provocative comedy.

Trouble strikes when the band slowly falls apart and they go separate ways. Structure is repetitious but the conclusion bares fact. Directing debut for Hanks who successfully captures the 1960's as well as the struggles of the music industry. He also provides a moral centre in a small but pivotal role as the band's manager.

Liv Tyler plays a girlfriend abandoned by another band mate. It is obvious that she will end up with Scott but her closing speech to her ex bares truth. Steve Zahn provides some humour as someone who quits the band to join the military. Superb production gives convincing view of 1960's and the music industry during the period.

I grew up with the film and it is still one of my best favorite action Stallone films! People seriously,simply don't understand what the movie is about. It's an action thriller, revenge Flick! The film is misunderstood and it is different Stallone film than in any other action films he played. The Specialist is not a masterpiece, the greatest or the best action film, but it is solid and good. It is an Entertaining action thriller from the beginning to the end.Stallone plays an trained Ex CIA agent who kills accidentally in Bogota, Colombia a wife and a kid and the bombing goes awry. I loved it how a CIA agent went trough hell, than he leaves the business and becomes a gun for hire. I love the character Ray Quick, I even memorize Stallone's Character! He is a trained henchman an Ex Special Forces The Bomb Specialist expert and Ex CiA Agent turned mercenary for hire, I love that! In this movie Stallone doesn't use a hand gun or any machine guns trough whole film, but he uses his expatriate, high explosives and hand to hand combat to kill a mobster and corrupted cop who was once a promising CIA agent but killed an innocent people and set up Ray!Stallone's character is well done written, he has a heart. He refused to kill innocent people, women and children, when he set up the bomb in Miami to kill Tomas Leon, inside was May and the bomb explodes, Ray cared and run to stop the bomb but he was too late. Stallone goes to the funeral of the woman identified as May Munro, he mourns and he is filed with quilt with killing an innocent person again. On a bus ride, Ray gets out of his seat and offers it to a pregnant woman. The people haven't see that or noticed, how a good hearted person the character is. He even took a cat under his wing. I love Ray Quick I don't care what anyone says! This movie has always been flawed with it's screenplay, a powerful score, lush cinematography and a solid cast. It has plot holes, but I still love it. I love the twists, the action sequences, the erotic's sex scenes in the hot tub, this scene really never bothered me. The special effects were great, the bomb explosions. I absolutely love this movie. It is very stylish, sexy and explosive. Stallone and Stone were perfect together. The Miami scenery was awesome. The music score was amazing. And the action was intense. Sylvester Stallone is truly an amazing actor and a truly a great talent. Also James Woods gave a powerful performance as Ned Trent a vengeful a hired assassin and a corrupt cop! Sharon Stone did a wonderful performance as a drop-dead beauty! I love the bus ride scene! Ray Quick gets out of his seat and offers it to a pregnant woman, only to have a young hoodlum take the seat instead. Quick calmly beats the crap out of the hoodlum and all his friends, throwing one of them out a window (not open), and then re-offers the seat to the woman. This scene has no bearing on the plot, but helps us get to know Quick. It is awesome powerful scene! Why I love this movie? I love it because in this movie Stallone doesn't use gun or machine guns but he uses his expatriate, high explosives and hand to hand combat. The Specialist is the most Underrated Action Thriller. I love Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct to another action thriller The Specialist and I love James Woods playing a villain in this movie. This was the only action movie that Stallone made in 1994 it was success but it turned in to one of very underrated movie and honestly I don't care.This movie is, apart from the film music, as a whole a must-see for action movie lovers with erotic scenes, built in smoothly. The double role of May makes the movie richer there IS a plot possible in these kind of movies!. Action abound and well distributed over the time. Eric Roberts and James Woods play their roles at the same high level as Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone. I see originality, in the sense of action the highly developed explosive devices-do hey really exist? CIA will know.. A flaw ,which I do not understand up to now, is that the getaway boat from M&M seafood seemed to be so readily available. The goofy trick with the telephone in the Fontainebleau Hotel as well, but those are not disturbing details. The movie has a steady pace and ends with the Miami Sound Machine!. Best scene is of course , the intimate scene in the hotel. Superb entertainment! Two of Hollywood's biggest stars combine fiery action with steamy sensuality in The Specialist. Sharon Stone, a drop-dead beauty with a fatal past. She's sworn death to the mobsters who murdered her parents and she's decided the method of their disposal blast 'em- one by one- to kingdom come. She also knows the right man for the job cool-fire ex-CIA explosives expert Ray Quick (Sylvester Stallone). That is your basic plot!

Not now, back then. Back in 1988, when 20 years old Patrick Dempsey and 18 years old, Jennifer Connelly played together in Some Girls a different teen movie. Well, for the boys which are keen on seeing a sexy 18 years old Jennifer Connelly chased around by the cute doctor from Grey's Anatomy, in a mahogany castle with very little clothes on, then this is it.Well get your girl, wife etc.. and turn in for a good movie to remember how it was. Not now, back then.Although it hadn't score big on IMDb for a movie from 1988, when IMDb was not around to keep score, the movie is not what you'd expect. Not some soapy soap opera or a teen comedy that you'll easily predict, this is painted in tones of brown and whites with a sparkle of green.Patrick Dempsey, which in my opinion I wouldn't call exactly beautiful, (not now, back then) is the main actor and plays a troubled young men who gets the *friendzone of the mothers of friendzones.*(for the uninitiated, friendzone = you get this from the girl that you love desperately and all she wants from you is to be just friends)Looking back at his career it's like he chooses these type of guys who eventually get out of the zone. As if he wants us to know that yes, it's possible. (Can't buy me love \/ Made of Honor \/ Enchanted etc )Jennifer Connelly is exactly as i thought, because this is the first movie that you should see with her the angel with cold ice heart that every teen boy had a crush on, sometime in his growing up years. She was 18, i don't know if i mentioned that. For a more mature representation in the same era, I strongly suggest this movie The Hot spot.The directing is beautiful because of the tones he chooses. The shots are naturally and flow easily with in the story which looks like it's pulled out from a book or maybe they have done such a good job that you think this was from a book.Other works from MR. Hoffman will let you find that he does have a different eye on these kind of movies.Nevertheless, eye candy is there for boys and girls as well, but the film does know when to turn serious and when to play with your smile.IMDb was not around back then so, some of the good movies are getting sided because of this. I know life it's happening and stuff, but some of them deserve just a little more than a 6 mark.PS HUGE ONE!Mr. Dempsey who played the most romantic movies of the 90's and 00's earns my appreciation for the way he does that and how easily he can make it seem, but also for... and I do mean i look up at him for this... for some years now, he is racing.

One of the most brilliant and creative films I've ever seen, Back to the Future is an enduring classic.The star of the show is Marty McFly, played with utter brilliance by Michael J. Fox. Marty is a bit of a cool kid, but as played by Fox he's also a bit of a goof and he's hilarious to watch. In my opinion, McFly is the greatest movie protagonist of all time. He rattles off the incredible dialogue from Zemeckis and Bob Gale but also injects it with such authentic emphasis and ums and ahs that its so easy to watch without thinking that you are watching a performance. He has incredible chemistry with Doc Brown (the unparalleled Christopher Lloyd). Also making up the superb cast are Lea Thompson as Marty's mother, Crispin Glover as his father and Thomas F. Wilson as Biff (one of the greatest film bullies of all time, thanks to Wilson's intimidating yet incredibly funny performance).Alan Silvestri's iconic score is perfectly utilised to create a sense of triumph at key moments in the film. Zemeckis directs the hell out of the film with some superb long takes and superbly choreographed scenes. The film's climax is one of the most tense and brilliant scenes Zemeckis has ever made. But its the screenplay that makes the masterpiece - chock full of quotable dialogue, memorable characters and one of the most accessible time travel stories of all time. The story of Marty's parents is so much better now than I've ever realised; Lorraine's sheltered upbringing and George's timid persona set them up perfectly - their love story before Marty arrives is just as believable as their story as set by Marty, AND its just the right set of circumstances for his arrival to set it in jeopardy. It could have gone any way. Zemeckis and Gale place well written scenes in two different time periods to make a point more flawlessly than any amount of exposition ever could. There are some problems with the film - after George's triumphant victory in the car park, the film needs to put in one more obstacle for him to overcome (a red haired brat who is never seen before or after) which just feels like borrowing time (which was needed but could have been done better). But all you need to do is watch Michael J. Fox shred the guitar to Johnny Be Good and you'll be giving out a perfect rating just like I did.

Before watching this movie in, I had watched this movie more than twice with my family. It was a long time ago so I cannot remember. Now on to the review. This is a personally one of my favourite movie. I thought Pierce Brosnan (Mamma Mia) and Linda Hamilton (Terminator) were brilliant!! At the start of the movie I thought it was sad. It is where Pierce's character's (Harry Dalton) girlfriend got hit by a pyroclast that had pierced through the car, and had died. I quite liked the part of the plot were Linda's character (Rachel Wando), who was the mayor and a coffee shop owner, came around to the motel where Harry and his team where staying, to give them coffee and Greg (Grant Heslov) came bounding out yelling ,Coffee, Coffee, Coffee, Cappuccino! I laughed so hard at that part. That saddest part of the movie was were Granny Ruth (Elizabeth Hoffman) died, trying to save Rachel, Harry and the kids from a lake that had turned into a giant pool of acid. They were travelling across the lake when the acid starts to eat the boat and it starts to sink, so Ruth jumps into the lake and pulls the boat to the side of the lake. The part of the movie where I thought it was unrealistic when they drove over the lave and the wheels of the truck ,they stole, burst into flames but I think the extreme heat from the lava would at least exploded the gas tank of the car resulting in the explosion of the car. I think the real star of the movie was the volcano because I caused the most mayhem. All together I really like this movie. I would watch this move about ten more times before I got sick of it. The rating for this movie would be 9 out of 10. ","genre":null},{"date":"5 November 2015","score":"","review":" Hello there, I am reviewing the movie, Dante's Peak. I watched this movie in my year 10 Geography class. Before watching this movie in, I had watched this movie more than twice with my family. It was a long time ago so I cannot remember. Now on to the review. This is a personally one of my favourite movie. I thought Pierce Brosnan (Mamma Mia) and Linda Hamilton (Terminator) were brilliant!! At the start of the movie I thought it was sad. It is where Pierce's character's (Harry Dalton) girlfriend got hit by a pyroclast that had pierced through the car, and had died. I quite liked the part of the plot were Linda's character (Rachel Wando), who was the mayor and a coffee shop owner, came around to the motel where Harry and his team where staying, to give them coffee and Greg (Grant Heslov) came bounding out yelling ,Coffee, Coffee, Coffee, Cappuccino! I laughed so hard at that part.
