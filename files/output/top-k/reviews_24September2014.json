Thomas A. Anderson, played by Keanu Reeves, is a man living two lives. By day he is an average computer programmer and by night a hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and electrochemical energy and who imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents super-powerful computer programs devoted to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion. The Matrix is an immensely entertaining and philosophical film that for me is the greatest sci-fi film ever made and nothing will ever come close to it again. The Matrix soundtrack theme is, Clubbed to Death, instrumental composition by Rob Dougan and again it just fits the epic feel to the film so well. Everything about this film is just terrific including the mind blowing special effects. It is just incredible, there are no other words to describe The Matrix.

George Lucas took space adventures and space travel to the next level of film fantasy, and was such an inspiring pioneer. Star Wars episode IV is a typical genre film that is shot digitally with incredible special effects. Star wars episode IV is based on the rival between the good and evil of the force, and how mankind once again must rely on the good of the force to protect the galaxies from Lord Vader and the dark side. George Lucas is a master of film editing and uses so many techniques in this film from fade in fade out, dissolve, establishing shot, shot\/ reverse shot, eye line match, and fast cutting. Every scene seemed to flow smoothly from each sequence, and I felt so drawn into each scene that I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the next scene. Sound effects used in this film were incredible and extremely effective from the sounds of Lord Vader breathing you could just feel the power in his voice, and the sounds of the light sabers when battling. The sounds of the battleships and voices of Chewbacca, RC3PO, R2D2 and other characters were so real meaningful to their parts in the film. The music in the film had such a dramatic impact and theme in the film such as scenes with Lord Vader and the dark side. I felt that the music had such a mysterious tone that it gave me a sense of fear when shots and scenes of the dark side shown. The way Gorge Lucas used sound to each shot and scene was remarkable, because every sound had some meaning and made the scene come to life and so realistic. The sound effects I felt were synchronous sound and diegtic sound, and what drew me deeper into each sequence. When it comes to cinematography George Lucas was the pioneer of digital photography. I have the same feeling that George felt for digital photography it brings more clarity and realism to each shot. George was able to create films sets in digital photography that he couldn't have done using film. The film used many techniques from tight framing, loose framing, and symmetrical composition. Camera perspectives such as deep focus and zoom shot helped make the digital shots more to the mind of the viewers. Camera positions such as bird's eye view, eye level shot, and low angle shots made scenes more powerful and dramatic. I feel camera distance was a major focus on each shot because George wanted to give viewers the sense that they were right there in the scene. Viewers could see the details in every costume, set design, and how life like each subject looked. George used close up shots and medium shots on subjects when battling or in conversations. Extreme to long shots used when showing the Death Star battle cruisers passing by and the conflicts with the Galactic fighters. Camera movement such as panning, crane shots, and hand-held shots were incredible smooth between each shot and scene. I believe that the cinematography and sound brought the other aspects of the film together. I feel George Lucas wanted to create a film that reached out to all individuals by giving the power of imagination in space travel. Star Wars episode IV gives you hope that good will conquer evil, and if you believe in your inner self that anything can happen. All mise-en-scene of this film was done with high detail and a deep imagination. It is this detail and imagination that sticks in the minds of children and adults for generations to come. I have never enjoyed a film so much or was drawn into the film as much as Star Wars episode IV film. This film is a must see for the whole family and gets a two thumbs up.

Roger Ebert said Milo&#x9A; Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a film so good in so many of its parts that there's a temptation to forgive it when it goes wrong. But it does go wrong, insisting on making larger points than its story really should carry, so that at the end, the human qualities of the characters get lost in the significance of it all. And yet there are those moments of brilliance. Many of people agreed that The on screen battle between Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher serves as a personal microcosm of the culture wars of the 1970s -- and testament to the director's vision that the film retains its power more than three decades later. The film is considered to be one of the greatest American films ever and it is easy to see why. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is both uplifting and disheartening in equal measure and it is because of the marriage of these two components that stirs such emotions in the viewer.

The acting and performances are nothing short of fantastic and the actors will make you feel less & less sympathetic (if you have any in the first place) towards any of their characters. Renton - very likable & you always hope that he beats his habit; Spud - again, is likable and you end up feeling sorry for him as he's just one of those lemming-type's of people that follows his friends; Sickboy - just purely selfish and uncaring; Begbie - a really vicious b***ard, always looking for an excuse to fight, and you always hope he get's his comeuppance; Tommy - the sensible one of the bunch (or is he?).This is a really powerful movie, and is not really for the feint of heart as it's pretty disturbing (as well as gross) in a good few scenes.

From showing you the squalor that these people live in for the majority of the time, the mishaps that they get into, and what happens to some of them, if this is glamourising then I'd hate to see what a movie that is against drugs & crime is like.For me this movie tells you one basic message - if you take drugs and live a life of crime then this is what your life will end up being like. The acting and performances are nothing short of fantastic and the actors will make you feel less & less sympathetic (if you have any in the first place) towards any of their characters. Renton - very likable & you always hope that he beats his habit; Spud - again, is likable and you end up feeling sorry for him as he's just one of those lemming-type's of people that follows his friends; Sickboy - just purely selfish and uncaring; Begbie - a really vicious b***ard, always looking for an excuse to fight, and you always hope he get's his comeuppance; Tommy - the sensible one of the bunch (or is he?).This is a really powerful movie, and is not really for the feint of heart as it's pretty disturbing (as well as gross) in a good few scenes. In saying that, though, it most definitely makes for compelling viewing.Definitely recommended.

Endorsed by the chief a nice cameo by Dern, the un-officially sanctioned Hat Squad, Hoover (Nolte), Coolidge (Palminteri), Hall (Madsen), and Relyea (Penn) are like modern day Earp Brothers riding around the boulevards of broken dreams in the ultimate Western boom town, The City of Angels, tinsel town, LA. Their mission is to keep the vice rackets under local control and their territory\/turf runs from the desert ranges of the Cal\/Nev border country to the Pacific rim. Their targets are any organized crime mobsters from the Mid West or East Coast who they sort of run out of town by sundown by escorting them to Mulholland Falls, sort of like Niagara Falls without the water.spoilersHoover makes you think of Dashiell Hammett's Continental OP, a big imposing stocky cross between Noir icons Sterling Hayden and Raymond Burr. He wields justice with a sap, again reminiscent of the way Wyatt Earp would coldcock outlaws with his Buntline special, and re-enforcing the films Wild West vibe. His partner Coolidge reminds you of Joseph Calleia's character in Touch of Evil, is a slightly neurotic transplanted Easterner, the squads methods of vigilante justice are effecting his life to the point to where he is seeing a female psychiatrist. The attempts by Coolidge to deal with old school Hoover's wild mood swings and his admonitions to the squad about how they agreed that they weren't going do this or that again are quite humorous. Hall and Relyea are both more laconic, though Hall is the cockier of the two. When the squad about to launch a victim off the falls mobster You can't do this this is America. Hoover This ain't America, this is LA...The catalyst to the decent into Noirsville is when the squad is sent to investigate the body of a woman who is embedded face down into the ground at a housing development in the hills above LA. She looks like she was run over by a steam roller, and when she is pried out and turned over her identity is known to Hoover who is visibly shaken. His reaction is noticed by his squad mates. An autopsy indicates that she fell from a great height, like a cliff, but there are no cliffs at the site. An X-Ray has a curious blank section caused by a radio active piece of glass. Back at headquarters a film canister arrives addressed to Hoover and a screening reveals a stag film spliced with shots of a desert resort, a military instillation, a hospital ward and soldiers at a tactical atomic bomb test.The stag film shows the films equivalent to the femme fatale, Allison Ponds (Connelly) a love goddess, fatal in one way or another to all the men she touches. Connelly is like a brunette Marilyn Monroe and she displays her assets in all their glory. Allison in the film is screwing an unknown man, Hoover's reaction to the film spurs Coolidge to confront him about the girls identity, and Hoover confesses to having a six month affair with Allison, a high priced prostitute. In flashback we see Hoover, during a raid on an after hours club, walk in on Allison bitch slapping a pimp who was about to shoot the teen aged girl laying on a bed behind her with junk. Hoover over doses the pimp dead with his own needle. Allison's best friend and neighbor is Jimmy Fields (McCarthy), a gay photographer, he sent the film footage to Hoover as both evidence of a government cover-up (the reason he thinks that Allison was killed) and for protection from her killers. He confesses to the existence of other films indicating that he also has a film of Hoover with Allison.The radioactive glass and the film sends the squad like a posse, riding across the desert to a Nevada test site in a 49 Buick Roadmaster. This beautifully filmed sequence strongly enforces the contemporary modern setting with the classic Hollywood Western replacing horses with automobiles, while at the same time evoking classic era Western US Noirs.Classic Noir locations used are the Los Angels City Hall, the Pacific Coast at Malibu, Desert Hot Springs, and Mulholland Drive. The film adds to that list a neat googie style apartment with pool and what has to be a unique instantly iconic neo noir location, the Sedan Crater in Nevada, a spooky nuclear bomb test site. The nuclear test angle of the story is a nod to Kiss Me Deadly but I've read that the films original ending was for Hoover and Coolidge, after surviving an emergency landing too near a test site, were to be incinerated by a nuclear blast. Now how utterly noir would that have been?I say I like it better than LA Confidential, and more every time I watch it. The Cinematography by Haskell Wexler (In The Heat Of The Night) is gorgeous.It got the hats right, it has a nice rendition of Harbour Lights by Aaron Neville, you gotta love that Buick Roadmaster convertible tooling across the gorgeous desert landscapes and also Jennifer Connelly's boobs. I guess you gotta find out these things for yourself rather than go by critics, it's the reason I never checked it out. WTF were they thinking? Is it because almost nobody wears fedoras anymore or drive dinosaur gas guzzlers?, or was it because the cast was all adults and smoking is frowned upon, who knows.

Pulp Fiction is one of these movies. What is so special about Pulp Fiction is the black comedy in it. Funny conversations covered with pure violence, amazing acting, and great soundtrack, interesting story and the great mind of Quentin Tarantino. This movie has no other example in the cinema history that's why it will always be considered as one of the best and also it is a great influence for the films that came after it with the same genre. Probably because of this movie Quentin Tarantino is considered as one of the best directors of all times and with this motivation he has made some other great films and honestly I am very lucky to have the chance to live in the same era with him. Because imagining a cinema without Quentin Tarantino makes me scared. These are my pure thoughts about the movie.Now I want to write about some facts; John Travolta became a worldwide known star after this film as well as Samuel Jackson and Uma Thurman. Most of the time, if you ask a person about one of these actors, they will probably tell you this movie. So imagine the effect of this movie for their fame. The film was nominated For 7 Academy Awards and won one of them which is; Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Unfortunately Quentin Tarantino didn't manage to win Best Director Award with Pulp Fiction and I honestly believe that he will never been given an Oscar as a director because I don't think he can make a movie better than this. He can make as good as this but not better than this.According to Quentin Tarantino, John Travolta was chosen for the role only because Michael Madsen has chosen to take the role in another film and after that he regrets this decision. However for John Travolta, he was nominated for Best Actor which brought him a worldwide fame. The film was released for the 1st time In Cannes Film Festival on May 1994, and October 14, 1994 in US. The film has 154 minutes of theatrical release and made with a budget of 8.5 million dollars, it grossed around 213 Million Dollars. For Pulp Fiction, I think the least important thing was the finance because the film has broken any record possible and became a masterpiece. About movies like this, I don't like to talk about the story because I assume everybody knows about it already, however shortly I can say that the movie is about a mysterious briefcase, small gangsters and the story of Los Angeles Mobsters but I must say that what is good about the film is not the story but the conversation and the mixture of comedy with violence and the way how people see it.

'' this heart touching line is from 1999's Hollywood film ''The Green Mile''.''The Green Mile'' is the combination of Miracles and Humanity and it's the conflicts between the 'Responsibility' and the 'Morality', it's a story of the Prison Officer Paul who once witness the arrival of the John Coffey who is convicted of killing two little girls, but he is endowed with some miracle power of healing and seems to be very soft and calm in his tone and do not exhibit any traits of being a criminal, he becomes very close to Paul right after healing his problem and Paul's co workers also witnesses John's miracle when he bring back the dead mouse into life he then also heals Paul's friend Hal's wife's brain tumor, looking at John's modest and piety nature Paul strongly feels that John is not the actual murderer and its sinful to have him killed with electrocution, eventually Paul comes to know that John is not the actual murdered and during this scene of confusion Paul asks John On the Day of the Judgement when I stand before the God and if he asks me why did I kill one of his miracles what do I say?

Many of these were, naturally, holiday-themed films playing off the success of HALLOWEEN. Then, there were the grimier slashers films, often bordering on exploitation, sometimes known as Splatter films for their rampant blood and gore. Make no mistake, this movie falls firmly into that category, but it is, in my opinion, the best of that bunch and stands out above a pack of forgettable movies.One of the first things that really stands out to me is the dirtiness of the film, on several levels. Taken literally, the movie was shot on 16 mm film, which lends itself well to a feeling of being someone's nasty little home movie. The background of a pre-cleaned up New York City plays into this as well. This is almost a perfect snapshot document of what the city felt like in 1980. The dirtiness, also, applies, of course, to the subject matter. These aren't the typically elaborate, fantasized killings of a Jason Voorhees movie, where the viewer is left with a certain naughty glee. These are brutal killings done to terrified women in real world situations. The result of all of this is a feeling that you are watching something you shouldn't be.This certainly translates into Joe Spinnell's character as well. Again making a connection to the more popular slasher films, we don't have an anti-hero here. This isn't some comic book slasher cracking one-liners while dispensing teens in fun ways. Much like HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, this is a true psychopath who feels like a fully fleshed character. You might see this guy pop up on an A&E documentary about violent crime. That, to me, adds to the gritty realism of this movie. Lustig pushes that further by making the villain the main character. Unlike a traditional slasher where we follow a final girl while she brings us through the story, this movie focuses squarely on Spinnell's maniac and brings us the world through his eyes.Of course, all of this would not have made this film such an underground legend were it not for the incredible effects of Tom Savini. At this time, TS was the undisputed master in horror efx and was making a killing (get it) pumping out effects for slasher movies. This might be his absolute best work, though. The shotgun scene and the final climax are phenomenal work that still hold up pretty well 35 years later. Even the simple efx like the scalpings are done well and look real. Again, this adds to the illusion of the movie for me. This isn't a Fulci or Romero movie with candy colored gore and over-the- top efx. All of it adds to this feeling of watching a snuff film.If you're a fan of stuff like LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT or the aforementioned HENRY, this movie is definitely up your alley.

All of those elements make Creepshow an excellent Horror-Comedy-Anthology classic that is George A. Romero and Stephen King at their best.Inspired by the EC Comics from the 1950s,Creepshow is an anthology that tells five different stories of Horror that mixes together and combines monsters,insanity,macabre with a twisted sense of Humor.Creepshow is a brilliant and unforgettable Horror-Comedy Anthology classic that was a collaboration between Horror masters Director George A. Romero and Author Stephen King(who also wrote the screenplay and plays a role in the film)that was at the right place and right time for both Romero and King in the 1980s because together the two came out with Creepshow one of the finest and most memorable Horror Anthologies of all-time that helped pave the way for Anthology movies and Television shows of the 1980s and 90s such as Tales From The Crypt and Tales From The Darkside and is also movie that is a Horror classic the moment you watch it. While there were sequels to Creepshow none of the follow-ups were able to capture the greatness and quality of this movie. What makes Creepshow such an amazing and great Horror Film is that it takes the style and influence of the EC Comics of the 1950s and gives viewers a movie that has five stories that mixes terror and laughs with an over the top style that is straight out of a Comic Book and is done in a surreal and demented way and never stops until the very end and will keep viewers are entertained for 120 minutes. Each of the five stories(Father's Day,The Lonesome Death Of Jordy Verill,Something To Tide You Over,The Crate and They're Creeping Up On You)are all fantastic stories that are memorable and different from one another dealing with subjects such as revenge,death,monsters and insects in a scary and darkly funny way and with every story there is always surprises. Now when I say scary I don't serious scary but scary in a Comic Book way because when ever something intense happens there is colors red,green and blue in the background scaring viewers while making see the colors behind the characters grabbing the viewer with not only stories or the characters but also the visuals. Horror and Comedy are two genres that go together very well and the laughs and humor in Creepshow is hilarious and done with an over the top and nutty glee that is done in not only a Comic Book style but is also in a Stephen King style where the Humor is so wild and over the top almost to a level of madness and insanity. Romero and King balances Horror and Humor perfectly and tells the viewers to have fun. What is also great about Creepshow is the well known actors in the cast that is one of the most memorable casts I have ever seen in a Horror film or Anthology movie that includes Hal Holbrook,Lesile Nelson,Ted Danson,Ed Harris,Adrienne Barbeau,E.G Marshall,Tom Adkins and Stephen King and more. This was Romero's first big studio movie with a known cast and with the exception of some of Romero's Zombie films this is probably the greatest cast I have ever seen in a Romero film. While all five of the stories in Creepshow are amazing and incredible my favorites are Something To Tide You Over and The Crate because both are well-written and tightly plotted as well as insane and wacky with shocks and laughs that are done with a crazy and bizarre energy that keeps going and going and never slows down which applies for all the stories but Something To Tide You Over and The Crate stand out the most. The violence and gore in Creepshow is exaggerated,wild and at times pretty disgusting and at times not for the weak at heart but it's not as bloody or gory like Romero's Zombie films so the blood and gore is not be taken seriously. The ending in Creepshow is amazing,memorable and brings the movie full circle with a weirdness and offbeat Humor that goes with the rest of the film. A terrific ending.The cast is wonderful. Hal Holbrook is excellent as Henry Northup,a College professor. Adrienne Barbeau is fantastic as Wilma,Henry's drunk,loudmouth wife. Leslie Nielsen is wonderful as Richard Vickers,a wealthy psychopath. Ted Danson is great as Harry Wentworth,a rival of Richard's. E.G Marshall is outstanding as Upson Pratt,a businessman who hates Bugs. Stephen King is funny as Jordy Verrill,an eccentric farmer. Ed Harris is good as Hank Blanie,a husband out of his element. Tom Adkins is memorable as Stan,an abusive Father. Fritz Weaver sensational as Dexter Stanley,a scared professor. Carrie Nye(Sylvia Grantham),Warner Shook(Richard Grantham),Viveca Lindfors(Aunt Bedelia),Elizabeth Regan(Cass Blaine),Jon Lormer(Nathan Grantham)and Gaylen Ross(Becky Vickers)give good performances as well. Also, lookout for cameos by Tom Savini(Garbage man#2)and Stephen King's son Joe Hill(Billy).The direction by George A. Romero is terrific and stylish with Romero bringing a beautiful and atmospheric visual look to the film with close ups,tilted angles and a colorful backdrop. Great direction,Romero.The score by John Harrison is fantastic,offbeat,weird and matches the twisted tone of the movie. Incredible score,Harrison.The Special Make-up effects by Tom Savini are fabulous,realistic and is truly among his best work as a make-up effects artist. Amazing make-up effects,Savini.In final word,if you love George A.
