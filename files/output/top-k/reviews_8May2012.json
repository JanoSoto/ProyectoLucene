The guy is one of the best, if not THE BEST,mainstream directors in film today. Everything he touches just seems to work. It's is hard to believe, but by this time last year, I had only seen one of of his films(for those of you wondering, it was, of course,Goodfellas). Now, in just the last four months, I have seen Raging Bull,Aviator,Casino,Hugo,Cape Fear,King of Comedy,Mean Streets,Shutter Island,Departed,Taxi Driver,and of course, the subject of this review,The Last Temptation of Christ.Now,before we start this review, let's address two thingsone,I'm a Christian, and twothis film is not based on the Bible. This is based on a fictional book that is all hypothetical. I am a open minded Christian, so this approach didn't bother me much. But I understand this approach isn't exactly very popular, so I hope this review will help you in making a decision to see this film on not.So, on with the review.The Last Temptation is the story of Christ, but as you have never seen it before. In this variation of the story, Jesus(Wilem Dafoe)is a carpenter who is tortured by thoughts of a darker kind. He is unsure exactly of where these thoughts and desires are originating fromGod or Satan. In order to get God to leave him alone, Jesus builds crosses from the Romans to crucify the rebel Jews, and because of this, Jesus is seen as a traitor by his fellow people, including Judas Iscariot(Harvey Keitel) and Mary Madaglene(Barbara Hershey),a woman he once had a brief relationship with, but has since become a prostitute.One day,Jesus gets fed up with the conflicting thoughts and voices, and so, he decides to go into the desert where he hopes God will make himself known to him. After a brief encounter with Satan, who tempts him with the desire to have a wife and children,Jesus calls out to God to save him,and God grants him salvation. Because of this, Jesus accepts his role as the Son of God, and begins to form the origins of Christanity. Although the final destination of the path Jesus is on remains unclear, in time more and more of his ultimate fate is finally revealed, as Jesus learns he is to die on the cross for humanity's sins.Eventually, Jesus does end up on the cross, and this is where he confronted with his final temptationwhether to give up dying on the cross to save humanity for a wife and children or fulfilling his role as the savior of mankind. What follows is one of the most profound, spiritual, and most heartfelt scenes I have ever seen, but I prefer to let you see the scene for yourself. My description of the scene won't do it justice.What a movie! What a cast! Dafoe has always been a terrific actor, but he is incredible here and he brings the movie to another level just with his presence alone. Harvey Keitel is great as Judas, Jesus's most faithful servant(like I said, this is not based on the Bible).I don't why he got such bad reviews for this performance;the way he delivers his lines is of sincerity and real emotional depth. Barbara Hershey is great as Mary. You really feel her pain of not being able to be with the man she loves, but also understand why it can never be. All the rest of the cast is good as well(David Bowie leaves a impression as Pilate), but those three in particular really stand out.Special mention must go to the score by Peter Gabriel. It is just hypnotic and really moving. One of the best scores in any motion picture. The sets are outstanding,the costumes are great,the direction fantastic,.............I just could go on and on, but I don't really need to. When you see this film, the film will just speak for itself.The only reason I am not giving it a perfect ten is that there all some weird moments in it,but I won't spoil them here. It didn't hurt my enjoyment of the film, and it probably won't hurt much of yours,either. One of Marty's best films!

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"8 May 2012","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Fans burnt by George Lucas' Phantom Menace found solace in Ang Lee's cosily straightforward Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. The film was greeted with a shrug in China (it was a flop), a country desensitised to wuxia tales, but Westerners loved it. Probably because Tiger is basically Star Wars, with its own assortment of bounty-hunters, Jedis, Sith Lords, princesses, rogues, warriors, villains, henchmen, Yodas, fairy tale romances, teachers, masters, apprentices, chosen ones and much vague talk of destiny, fate and light and dark sides. When he's not indulging in super choreographed action sequences, Lee's aesthetic is also very Lucasy, which is to say, very John Ford, very David Lean, very Kurosawa, with clean lines, big open spaces, and simple but careful shot selection. What's strange is the film's budget. The film looks like it has the budget of one of those big, state backed Chinese or Stalinist productions, but Crouching was made for about fifteen million dollars. Lee gets a lot of mileage out of his budget.Martial arts fans abhor Tiger. It's too geared to western tastes, too watered down, and China's been churning out similar wuxia for decades. Why should this one get all the credit? But Lee does put his own spin on the material. His film is more sensual, poetic, graceful, romantic, has a mysterious beauty, and is more delicate than is typical of the genre. His female characters are also given a bigger role than is customary and his action at times seems more like expressive dance.Repression, restrictions, strict moral codes and self-control are an obsession with Lee. With Hulk we had a scientist who struggles to curb his anger, his Taking Woodstock, Wedding Banquet and Brokeback Mountain revolved around characters repressing their homosexuality, while Sense and Sensibility, Lust Caution, Ice Storm and Woodstock again all hinged on either repression, free expression or the inhibiting of desire. In Crouching's case &#x96; the title itself refers to one who has hidden, suppressed talents - we have a stifled three-way love between characters called Mu Bai, Shu Lien and Jen Yu, all of whom are prohibited from desire by strict moral\/social codes, feudal customs and warrior traditions.The rejection of these codes is perhaps why the film was shunned by China (and is so popular with western women). Chinese mythology, Taoist philosophy and the hokey mysticism of Asian martian arts films (akin to Star Wars' The Force), all stress an esoteric mode of detachment, a form of denial characteristic of Eastern thought in which the world is seen to be illusory and detached cogitation is seen to be the path to enlightenment. Lee, in contrast, is trading in a more genteel, Western sensibility; a kind of romantic humanism where one is called to ditch Eastern stoicism and embrace the reality and meaning of human attachments in this life. This tug-of-war is epitomised by a trio of conversations located in each of the film's three acts. In the first, characters called Mu Bai and Shu Lien, who we learn have long had feelings for each another but have denied these feelings to pursue the demands of a Wudan warrior lifestyle, discuss the fact that Mu Bai, when meditating, reaches not the bliss of enlightenment but a place of endless sorrow. For Mu Bai, passions cannot be extinguished and only serve to increase the pull of desire. Mu Bai's conflict &#x96; the way clinging to personal affection is contrary to his Wudan ways of detachment &#x96; can be found even in Lucas' Star Wars prequels, only there Lucas has some monastic ninja kid literally moan about the way his calling prevents him from losing his virginity (Me want make sexy time but Yoda say no! Wah Wah Wah!).The second conversation occurs at the film's midpoint, when Mu Bai and Shu Lien finally touch. Shu Lien, he recoils, the things we touch have no permanence. My master would say there is nothing we can hold onto in this world. Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real. Shu Lien then brushes aside his Taoism with direct, naive realism Not everything is an illusion. My hand is real. It's in the third conversation that the film breaks away from your typical martial arts movie mysticism and repudiates Wudan philosophy. Here, Mu Bai is dying and Shu Lien urges him to meditate Free yourself of this world. Let your soul rise to eternity. Do not waste your breath on me. I have already wasted my life, Mu Bai responds. I would rather be a ghost drifting by your side, as a condemned soul, than enter heaven without you. Contrast this with the countless marital arts movies, or even the Star Wars franchise, which end with the ghostly spirits of dead warriors, monks and masters hovering contently over the living. Mu Bai is given no supernatural reprieve, no higher plane of existence. He just dies. The film then ends with the recounting of a mountain legend in which a young woman must paradoxically float away and never return if she wishes to return. The whole film hinges on a similar paradox acting on a desire one desires not to have. It's the paradox of Buddhism continually desiring to eliminate desire, whereby satiating desire is impossible and it is ultimately desire which blocks the road to desirelessness. This is contrasted with a more Western hedonism, where the hedonist attempts the cessation of desire by giving in to them all.Beyond all this, the film resembles the works of King Hu, Ozu and Ichikawa, the latter two only insofar as it contrasts straitjacketed older generations, and their societal obligations, with oppositional, younger generations. The film's ending suggests that a character called Jen sacrifices her life\/love so that Mu Bai and Shu Lien may finally be together.8.5\/10 &#x96; Worth two viewings.
