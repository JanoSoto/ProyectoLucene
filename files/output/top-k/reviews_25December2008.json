Just imagine, just really imagine the year is 3000 and some alien race really came and they killed most of us, and we need to rebuild society and some nerd scientology guy comes and says to you you see you see its just like the movie you were all bashing, its just like LRH said, you see we were right now we need to rebuild, where is the harrier, where is travolta? A suicide won't be enough, i will have to kill my self while riding Mr. Garrison's IT device with flexi-grip handles, probably choke on the handle while smiling!! were this people high, was everybody seriously very very very high? I was heaving spasms all the way through it, my face got weird like looking at something you cannot explain you cannot understand, you just cannot find the words and your mind cannot process it, error error error, I couldn't even reach for the remote. It would probably be same as you suddenly decided you are going to eat s**t, like taking a c**p and eating it after wards, and if do that, you will probably get the same bad feeling, taste and processing logic, same when watching this film. Thankfully I saw the movie and I know now how it would feel if you were to eat your or anybodies crap, literally!! But seriously WATCH THE MOVIE, but DON'T DON'T pay for it, if you can get it for free or anything watch and be ready! ) you wouldn't want to pay so eat c**p, would you now?
