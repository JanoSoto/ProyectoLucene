Cage is widely known for his roles in comedy movies (like in the Coen Brothers' 'Raising Arizona') or action flicks, like 'The Rock' or 'Conair'. Shue was discovered in 'Karate Kid' and was also in the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, but never giving a strong performance. But in 1995, both Cage and Shue proved they could act in Mike Figgs' 'Leaving Las Vegas'. This movie gave Cage his first (and only) Oscar, and Shue her first (and only) nomination. Their roles in this movie are still considered today the best parts in both careers.'Leaving Las Vegas' follows the story of Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage), a man that, after his wife runs away with his children, starts to drink, a lot. Now, after he lost his job and has nothing more to do with his life, he decides to go to Las Vegas to, according with his own words, drink himself to death. In Las Vegas, he meets a prostitute named Sera (Elizabeth Shue), and moves in with her, forming a beautiful, but problematic friendship. 'Leaving Las Vegas' script is based on a novel by John O'Brien, an American author that was also an alcoholic and shot himself to death only two weeks after the movie's production began. Some people say that the character of Ben Sanderson represents the urge of the author to drink himself to death, and I agree with them. One could've only wrote such sad and deep characters on depressive times. Throughout the whole movie, the author discusses themes such as alcoholism, rape, prostitution, etc, but always in a very subtle, almost gentle way. The dialogs are simply fantastic, and the story develops in a remarkable way. O'Brien's novel was adapted here by the own Mike Figgs', who was Oscar-nominated for his work.The strongest point of 'Leaving Las Vegas' is, indeed, the acting. Aside from Cage and Shue, any other actor here have big roles. The only one with a little more screenwriter was Julian Sands, as Yuri, Sera's pimp. And Julian Sands delivered a good performance, but that's not nothing compared to the job of the two main actors of the picture. Nicolas Cage was almost perfect as Ben Sanderson, giving one of the best drunk-man interpretations of all time. The second best, if you ask me, only behind Ray Milland's job in Billy Wilder's 'The Lost Weekend'. His voice levels, his body movements, everything seems so perfect for a drunken man. And even when Ben Sanderson isn't drunk, Cage managed to give such depth to the character that it's impressive. One particular scene where Ben goes to the bank in the morning but still haven't had a shot, really blew me away. That scene proved all Cage's talents, and beyond. He completely deserved the Oscar he got. My only wish is that he does more serous roles like this, but that seems unlikely, considering his filmography nowadays. Elisabeth Shue was also excellent in the role of the prostitute Sera. She wasn't better than Nicolas Cage, but she came real close. I haven't seen 'Dead Man Walking', so I can't really say if she deserved the best Actress Oscar-award more than the winner for that year, Susan Sarandon.Aside from his nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, Mike Figgs was also nominated for his directing job in this picture. and it is truly great indeed. The way Mike Figgs makes the audience connect to all those characters is incredible. Notice how the actors are almost always is close-ups, and if they are not, how the camera is far away from then. Figgs utilizes the music in a perfect way, also. All those Jazz ballads fit into the movie like a glove, and they are all composed by the own Mike Figgs and sung by Sting. Figgs utilized the music specially to increase or decrease the dramatization of each scene, to make the audience feel sorry or not for these two characters. Each scene has also a strange and sad look, thanks to the nice cinematography by Declan Quinn. Overral, I really liked 'Leaving Las Vegas'. Of course the movie isn't perfect, but it serves as an excellent character study, showing all the dangers of alcoholism or prostitution. Mike Figgs' job is truly remarkable in here, not only for the adaptation of John O'Brien's novel, but also for his directing and composer jobs.

They have no idea why this occurred or if it will ever end or if Knotts is god, but oddly neither questions this new world that is literally in black & white like an old episode of Father Knows Best.

Notions such as freedom to choose, sex and individuality are missing in this world--and the two interlopers bring this to the plastic world of Pleasantville.By the way, Pleasantville is odd in many ways. First, all roads in town lead right back to town and no one has ever left the town or knows anything about the world outside. Second, books are blank inside and the people have no idea about what they contain. Third, when there is a fire, the fire department actually has no idea WHAT a fire is--they are only used to things you might see in the TV world--such as rescuing cats stuck in trees. In fact, how Tobey is able to finally convince the firemen to come to his house when there is an actual fire is pretty funny. There's a lot more that is strange about the town and it gets stranger when the influence of the two outsiders slowly causes actual colors to begin appearing in the monochrome world.The film is a strange surreal sort of thing that is truly unique. Using colorization techniques, they are able to achieve amazing results that seem to jump off the screen. It's all a metaphor about how the idyllic life of 50s TV was actually quite stilted and repressive, though Maquire and Witherspoon's life in the real world isn't exactly great either--their parents are divorced and Witherspoon is, to put it nicely, a bit shallow and slutty. A happy medium would sure be nice--combining the best of both worlds--and I think this is a valid interpretation of the film's intent. Where exactly it all goes and the unexpected consequences are something you'll just have to learn about yourself, so watch the film.Overall, a rather interesting and innovative film.

The only real misgiving I have is the way SOME might see the film and come to the conclusions that the 1950s were all bad and repressive--a rather oversimplification of the era, to say the least.

I know, as I've taught US and World History--kids are THAT gullible...really. I can't really blame the folks from Pleasantville for this lack of awareness in teens, but it did concern me as I watched the film.By the way, one thing I liked about the film was the courtroom scene and William Macy's acting.

I left the cinema totally numb after this experience, not knowing how I really felt about the movie. All I was thinking was why? Do we really need a another movie about the atrocities of war? Perhaps I just don't want to know the truth or see the reality of this horror that mankind seems determined to continually perpetuate. The heart of man is evil continually. Even more frightening than this is the fact that the powers of the world who have set their minds to war and murder to maintain control would not even think twice after viewing this film.For Spielberg this film was evidently a lot more than just a revelation of World War II. This was a message from son to father, a call for approval from a boy to his dad. The fact that Arnold Spielberg was overcome with emotion may indicate that his boy did good this time. Steven is as masterfully in control of this film as he was with Schindler's List. I still feel the earlier film is his dramatic best, yet it is difficult to fault Private Ryan in its execution. It is only its concept that I am still battling with.Tom Hanks plays yet another all American, this time the captain who is ordered to take a small band of men to find Ryan. His performance was strong, yet I was not truly blown away as I expected to be. Perhaps I have come to expect too much of the great Mr. Hanks. The support cast are also intense, and include Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg and Barry Pepper. Special mention goes to Tom Sizemore as Sargeant Horvath, Jeremy Davies as the timid Corporal Upham and Matt Damon, credible as the last of the Ryan brothers. Ted Danson and Dennis Farina drop in as senior officers.Spielberg has again teamed with Schindler's cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, and the results are astounding. The opening sequence is particularly breathtaking. John Williams is of course the only choice for original score. In this impacting picture, I barely noticed his composition.

On second viewing, it is very hard to keep this argument up. Even if we have seen a dozen films such as this, Saving Private Ryan is still a very important film. Why? It shows us the horror that war is. The waste, the destruction and the total futility of the whole thing. Why do we keep destroying each other like this? What is wrong with us?

And some have criticized the effort of Darren Aronofsky as nothing but a stylistic shocker making up, with shrewd manipulation of montage images, sound effects, split screens and fast forward frames etc. for the lack of substance and story. I disagree to this last criticism.This is a story that traces the downfall of four protagonists, who succumb to one antagonist who has no physical form. I was disturbed by this story,not because of the style, but because this villain, called addiction,which resides in many of us and can attack us as well; it can consume and destroy us before we realize, particularly in this age of speed,of wanting things quick and soon; where the peer pressures, the information overload from the hidden persuaders of media overwhelm us with promises of better look before dawn, bigger busts by miracle treatments and millionaire by tomorrow schemes. If there is a message from this movie maker, I would say that it comes out as we sit back and painfully reflect on why these characters destroyed themselves. Then we realize that we must be at peace with what we are and what we have,cherish our achievements and esteem.All good stories have the important theme. The theme here is about the destructive nature of addiction. By the end of the movie, we are convinced that addiction can destroy anyone; common simple folks who can be of any age; who come from diverse backgrounds such as the four characters in this movie. The stories of four people in this film are the results of a chain of events that start off with normal, everyday folks and end in the worst kind of way, and in a way, aren't accidental, which maybe the saddest thing of all. These stories are parables to us of the roads best not taken.Now, how do you present a theme where we need to show the movement of four protagonists and an invisible satanic antagonist which resides in each of them? There are four parallel plots running at the same time and they are intertwined at the appropriate moments to nail the audience to the mood of despair and helplessness that the four characters feel. The dialogs are very minimal and the shots are detailed into effective montages to bring forth the losing fights. After seeing the movie and reading the script one can see, how well the story is enhanced by the careful style chosen by the story teller.In simple words, these are people who have their dreams like anyone of us. They are not unusual or weird people. Their objectives are not that of Einstein's or that of Hitler's! I believe this is what makes the movie a compelling piece of story. It hurts to watch this film, and is mentally painful to see the downfall these people, because the presentation is such that you start to care so much about these people. The director has made you to fall in love with these characters.There are two scenes which can break the heart of any woman audience in this movie. It shows to what extent a person can stoop to because of the addiction and later feel disgusted. First is the one where Marian walks out and vomits after her sex with Arnold. The complete scene is shot hand-held with a strange hazy lens focus which deliberately distorts and barrels the image. Marian is disgusted, dazed and controls her nausea as she leaves the room of Arnold. The other scene is where we see Marian in the bath tub from above when she seems to clear her inside with a scream and throwing out the dirt and disgust she has gone through in having sex with Big Tim. There is strong characterization to show how the drug addiction can make normal people to do most disgusting things. One may not like these shots, but they make you feel sad for the characters and feel disgusted about the ill effects of addiction. Is Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a dream a collection of montages to shock the audience while trying to cover a weak story? I do not think so. I believe that we have a strong story here which traces the journey of four individuals and this completes their portrayal in terms of bringing the full arc of transformation.

It was very foolish for her to spill out Jackies character to a co worker in a crowded elevator. Every time she hit Jackie you wanted him to sidekick her ass out the door. In my opinion, Jackie could have just stuck with Michelle and cut her out her part entirely. Storyline First the storyline seemed strait forward. Jackie is a cop, is hired by Chinese government to infiltrate a criminal gang learn there secret bring him down. No problems there. From that point is gets tricky and bad. It seems like the movie was written literally on spot, or as the movie went along. The transitions were not smooth towards the middle and to be honest, the movie started to get semi boring.

","genre":"Animation, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"23 March 2010","score":"","review":" Prior to the Matrix trilogy, the Wachowski brothers first feature movie was the movie 'Bound', which released in late 1996. Their directorial debut was a fantastic and impressive attempt at a tribute to the noir genre. The camera work and stylish close up shots proved to the audiences that they had the ability to make good movies. What I did not understand was how they ventured in to the sci fi genre with 'Matrix'. Maybe if they continued with this theme they could have had the opportunity to offer great noir movies like the Coen brothers have. Upon viewing this movie I asked myself 'what makes these directors and the movie in particular special ?'. Firstly for a noir movie fan, it has every element present. Greed, betrayal, money and murder. All factors were taken in to consideration. In fact it contains the perfect menu. However if I had the opportunity to add some ideas of my own, I would integrate a few more plot twists in the second half and increase the pace in the first half.As far as the director duo are concerned, there directing techniques and camera angles are brilliant. To direct a movie within a room setting can be a challenging task. So I feel that they are due all the credit they deserve. In terms of plot the movie is not complicated, but straightforward because a plan is made and then implemented. I have to be honest. It was very ingeniously thought out. The Warchowski brothers have wrote a great script. Much of their thoughts and ideas stem from the traditional noirs from the 50s era. Even Jennifer Tilly looked reminiscent of the evil women of the yester years. Her hair style and dresses were evident of this. ***************************SPOLIERS AHEAD********************** Tilly is the girlfriend to money launderer Palantinio. They stay in apartment next door to where Gershon who is a decorator fix it woman. At first glance both women have a liking to one another and it turns in to a relationship. Meanwhile Palantino recovers a large amount of cash from a fellow member that he has to pass on to his boss 'Gino'. Gino has a son by the name of 'Johnny', who Palantino does not get along with. This gives Gershon and Tilly the idea to devise a scheme of taking the money and placing the doubt of Johnny in to the min of Palantino. Their plans works out. Unfortunately Palantino reacts in a unpredictable manner and kills Gino and his son to save himself. Tilly and Gershon predict that he would go on the run however Palantino is persistent to get the money back. After he is unsuccessful he makes over plans that may spill more blood.******************END OF SPOILERS***********************Two factors stay in ones mind after watching the movie. The plot and the performances. Both are truly to the highest standard. They compliment each other very well. The noir theme has been combined beautifully with the backdrop of gangster characters. The black and grey set designs create the appropriate atmosphere and environment of a noir movie. If the movie was shot even in black and white I don't think it would have made much difference. The impact would have been similar. The close up shots are filmed very stylishly and seemed to be the source of inspiration for many of the Matrix movies. The pace of the movie is moderate. However the first half sets the plan in motion therefore it takes time for the movie to get going. After the midway point the movie progresses at a immense speed to satisfying climax. The lesbian context did not have much scope and neither was it core to the lot. But it proved a reason for the story to develop. I for one has not admired the movie just for that element. I can not help but assume that Tarantino may have been inspired to make 'Jackie Brown' after seeing this movie, despite it being based on a novel. The theme is very similar. The 'blame game' factor was also used in an Indian movie from 2003 called 'Boom'. The movie does contain many memorable and iconic scenes. I especially adored the part when Palantino kills Gino and his son. It is truly a nervous moment. As we can sense how Palantino would be feeling at the time. All performances were very good. However I would give special mention to Joe Palantino. He was under the skin in his character and mastered the accent wonderfully. He is the main attraction of the movie. Gina Gershon did not get much scope in the second half. While Jennifer Tilly gives a haunting performance. Any man would not be able to resist her charm and beauty.

Their directorial debut was a fantastic and impressive attempt at a tribute to the noir genre. The camera work and stylish close up shots proved to the audiences that they had the ability to make good movies. What I did not understand was how they ventured in to the sci fi genre with 'Matrix'. Maybe if they continued with this theme they could have had the opportunity to offer great noir movies like the Coen brothers have. Upon viewing this movie I asked myself 'what makes these directors and the movie in particular special ?'. Firstly for a noir movie fan, it has every element present. Greed, betrayal, money and murder. All factors were taken in to consideration. In fact it contains the perfect menu. However if I had the opportunity to add some ideas of my own, I would integrate a few more plot twists in the second half and increase the pace in the first half.As far as the director duo are concerned, there directing techniques and camera angles are brilliant. To direct a movie within a room setting can be a challenging task. So I feel that they are due all the credit they deserve. In terms of plot the movie is not complicated, but straightforward because a plan is made and then implemented. I have to be honest. It was very ingeniously thought out. The Warchowski brothers have wrote a great script. Much of their thoughts and ideas stem from the traditional noirs from the 50s era. Even Jennifer Tilly looked reminiscent of the evil women of the yester years. Her hair style and dresses were evident of this. ***************************SPOLIERS AHEAD********************** Tilly is the girlfriend to money launderer Palantinio. They stay in apartment next door to where Gershon who is a decorator fix it woman. At first glance both women have a liking to one another and it turns in to a relationship. Meanwhile Palantino recovers a large amount of cash from a fellow member that he has to pass on to his boss 'Gino'. Gino has a son by the name of 'Johnny', who Palantino does not get along with. This gives Gershon and Tilly the idea to devise a scheme of taking the money and placing the doubt of Johnny in to the min of Palantino. Their plans works out. Unfortunately Palantino reacts in a unpredictable manner and kills Gino and his son to save himself. Tilly and Gershon predict that he would go on the run however Palantino is persistent to get the money back. After he is unsuccessful he makes over plans that may spill more blood.******************END OF SPOILERS***********************Two factors stay in ones mind after watching the movie. The plot and the performances. Both are truly to the highest standard. They compliment each other very well. The noir theme has been combined beautifully with the backdrop of gangster characters. The black and grey set designs create the appropriate atmosphere and environment of a noir movie. If the movie was shot even in black and white I don't think it would have made much difference. The impact would have been similar. The close up shots are filmed very stylishly and seemed to be the source of inspiration for many of the Matrix movies. The pace of the movie is moderate. However the first half sets the plan in motion therefore it takes time for the movie to get going. After the midway point the movie progresses at a immense speed to satisfying climax. The lesbian context did not have much scope and neither was it core to the lot. But it proved a reason for the story to develop. I for one has not admired the movie just for that element. I can not help but assume that Tarantino may have been inspired to make 'Jackie Brown' after seeing this movie, despite it being based on a novel. The theme is very similar. The 'blame game' factor was also used in an Indian movie from 2003 called 'Boom'. The movie does contain many memorable and iconic scenes. I especially adored the part when Palantino kills Gino and his son. It is truly a nervous moment. As we can sense how Palantino would be feeling at the time. All performances were very good.

Right at the outset, they are given false names with an intention that they won't get too close and concentrate on the job instead. They are completely sure that the robbery is going to be a success. But when the police show up right at the time and the site of the robbery, panic spreads among the group members and one of them is killed in the subsequent shootout along with a few policemen and civilians. When the remaining people assemble at the premeditated meeting point (A warehouse), they begin to suspect that one of them is an undercover cop.Quentin Tarantino, which is one of the finest directors of all time, impressed me more as a writer than as a director in this movie. Right in its first scenes, we can see how well made the screenplay is, the conversation about Like A Virgin, and about tipping are priceless (He really convinced me that I should only tip when the waitress really deserves it). The dialogue is incredibly funny and unusual, that in it's first film, Tarantino defined his own genre. Some dialogues are so original, like when Mr. Pink (Buscemi) asks Mr. White (Keitel) about Mr. Orange (Roth), Is it bad?, and Mr. White answers, As opposed to good?. Or when Mr. Pink asks Mr. White if he killed any real people, and he answers, No, just cops.. Or the classic Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy? Or you're gonna bite?.The acting is really great too, Keitel makes a tough, but sensitive Mr. White, Buscemi makes a Mr. Pink that only cares about getting out of there without going to jail, not carrying about the others, and Michael Madsen does a charismatic psycho, and sadistic Mr. Blonde, that doesn't care about anything.

But he doesn't distract audiences from the really important characters, and so I can live with his existence. Also, the sexy Patricia Vasquez plays a much larger role in this film as Imhotep's re-incarnated girlfriend. The story is a bit longer-feeling but it keeps you interested, the important part.Now, the SFX are outrageously well executed for the most part, but a few things were a tad bit questionable.

His body didn't seem to blend well if you ask me. Another scene was Imhotep's suicide scene, which is tragic but is almost ruined by the look of this crevice of lost souls or whatever you want to call it. It looked rather unconvincing unfortunately.

Thomas Vinterberg delves into a story of a dysfunctional family with an unforeseen secret that has remained buried, which may have been for the best. Coming together for the seemingly honorable Helge, played by Henning Moritzen, a little known family secret is let out of the bag by his son Christian, played by Ulrich Thomsen, which ultimately led to Christian's sister's suicide.The first Dogma film ever created has left its mark on the Danish film industry. Festen is an intricate film, intertwining various themes such as concealment, abuse, and racism into one ball of entertainment. Vinterberg also intends to use the film as a symbol of Danish society, portraying their drinking habits and feelings towards immigration. This symbolism was not very apparent to me as an American viewer however. He probes an awkward subject and manages to turn it into an award winning film.The main theme depicted in this film is that of concealment. Helge is a well respected man and held in high regards by my peers and family. Our first few glimpses of Helge are of him laughing and playing with his grandchildren, seemingly enjoying himself as well as others enjoying him. As the movie progresses, the secret is revealed by Christian but it is not immediately known whether Christian is fibbing or not. The family doesn't have a strong response as I expected, rather the scene just sort of progresses. Helge even seems to convince Christian this was all fashioned in his own head when he tells Christian, I'm sorry but my memory must have slipped me because I do not remember this. Christian seemingly takes the bait when he claims he probably got it all wrong. The theme is full force here, as it seems that neither actors nor the audience know what it is true and what is not.Vinterberg furthers this theme in the movie when one of Christian's life long friends, Kim-played by Bjarne Henriksen, on staff at the lodge elects to retrieve and hide all of the guests keys just prior to Christian's unveiling of his father's true past. It is never really clear whether or not Christian knows about Kim's attempt to help Christian get his story across. We later see more secretive action when it is revealed that Christian's mother, Else-played by Birthe Neumann, knew of Helge's actions, yet did nothing to stop him. I got the impression that the suicide of the one daughter was seemingly forgotten when we see Christian's second sister, Helene-played by Paprika Steen, going to her room and saying it is one thing not to talk about it, but another just to cover it up. Also prevalent throughout the film was the noticeable abusive relationships held by some characters. I do not want to go in to too much detail and ruin the film, but on multiple occasions we see various forms of abuse. Such as when the guests are first arriving and getting into their rooms, we see Michael, played by Thomas Bo Larsen, and his wife Mette, played by Helle Dolleris, arguing over a pair of missing shoes. Michael gets upset with Mette because she forgot to bring his good shoes and a rather loud verbal dispute arises between the two. We see these two fighting again when Michael is in the shower and slips. He gets infuriated, claiming she left the soap on the floor, when actually there might have been some outside forces in play there. We continue to see little tidbits of abuse, at one point Helene and Michael get into an argument in which Helene calls Michael a nazi bastard. The metaphor of Danish society and their feelings towards immigration brings some abuse with it, mainly when the entire family sings a racist song with a black man present. Although it is in a different language, Helene tells him the nature of the song so he's not left in the dark (that was not a play on his skin color).Though there are numerous other occasions involving abuse, I will not go into it too much and ruin the movie. The continued abuse and concealment are intermingled throughout the movie. Some secrets have caused abuse, while some abuse has caused secrets. Vinterberg keeps you engaged throughout, wondering what twist he will throw at you next. I think he chose a subject, family troubles, that most everyone can relate to, although maybe not specifically, and creates a successful film. The characters in this film did a great job of wearing their emotions, making the language barrier not that big a deal.
