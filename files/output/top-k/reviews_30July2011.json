To me it was a rehearsal by Leone for the vastly superior 'Once Upon A Time In The West', my all-time favourite.When I last watched Blondie, Tuco and Angel Eyes I missed the start. The Man With No Name (except the endlessly repeated 'Blondie') was stumbling across the desert. Tuco was carrying on in a sadistically clownish manner that was simultaneously tedious and repellent. It was only sloth that held me in my seat.Most film directors are forever pulling the legs of their audiences. Leone is no exception. Using all sorts of tricks, he allows the story to creak along in the most improbable manner, either hoping that viewers won't notice or don't care. One of Sergio's little jokes is that if something isn't seen by the camera, neither will it be visible to the characters, even though they're looking in different directions. The best gag of this kind is when Tuco and Blondie are captured as they stumble into a huge army camp they somehow fail to spot.In like fashion, useful props materialise out of nowhere. While Tuco scrambles in the cemetery to dig up the stolen gold, Blondie manages to construct a makeshift gibbet from a convenient tree and a length of rope long and strong enough to tie up the 'Titanic'. And where did the the shovels come from in the treasure-hunting scenes? Almost every new twist was improbable.You have to admire the mixture of frailty and resilience of participants in Leone's films. Baddies are dispatched with a single shot. Tucos and Blondies are beaten or baked to within an inch of their lives but bounce back as readily as cartoon characters flattened by steamrollers.Some people don't mind poor lip-synchronisation, including Signor Leone, but I do. The distraction of mouths often moving independently of the words they purport to speak is aggravated by the laboured dialogue. Thank goodness Leone stepped up several gears for 'Once Upon A Time In The West' by using a brilliant writer and employing a much better cast (Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards, etc) than the irritating Eli Wallach and the dull-as-ditchwater Clint Eastwood.Despite these grumbles, there's a lot to be said in favour of 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly'. It's stylish, idiosyncratic and spectacular with a wonderful score by Ennio Morricone. But rather than be considered the greatest western ever, as judged by many enthusiastic IMDb reviewers, the film is better regarded as a highly creditable rehearsal for the undoubted masterpiece which followed.

The movie introduces Ruby (Leelee Sobieski) as a bit of a troubled kid, whose troubles become much more complicated when her parents are killed in a car accident, and she and her brother are sent to live with the Glass family - friends of their parents (played by Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane.) And, yes, the Glasses live in a house that seems to have a lot of glass - too cute by a longshot.The suspense is around the Glasses. What are they up to? They haven't been especially close to Ruby's parents in recent years, and there's a certain creepiness to them (and especially to Skarsgard's Terry) right from the start. That builds to the point where the Glasses become downright dangerous to the kids. However, there really isn't much mystery about what the Glasses want. (It's revealed fairly quickly that the kids have a large trust fund and that Terry needs money to pay off a loanshark he's in trouble with.) So there's no real suspense around motive, and you pretty much know that although it's going to be a rough ride the kids are going to end up OK (because they always do in this kind of movie.) So the story isn't really that compelling. The performances (mostly from Sobieski, Skarsgard and Lane) are decent, but I didn't think anyone in the cast was truly outstanding.Two things worked really well in the movie.

Patrick Bateman struggles to convince his own lawyer he had committed the killings the audience had seen him commit earlier in the film. There are various reasons why this is and neither Bret Easton Ellis in the novel or Mary Harron in the film rules decisively on which. One is that in this convincingly believable 80s NYC yuppie world, people have become so interchangeable that Bateman can kill countless numbers of people without anybody realising, because everyone is so generic. Hence why one of his victims mistake him for a co-worker, and why everyone Bateman knows seems to be Vice-President at Pierce & Pierce, and why the detective and his lawyer thinks his victim, Paul Allen, is alive and in London. Another possible reason is that people know he has killed people and they simply don't care, because the lives of others don't matter. As Bateman says while he is analysing Whitney Houston,'in this world where it's hard to empathise with others, we can above all empathise with ourselves'. Taken from this viewpoint, the story is an allegory for how the actions of American governments and corporations cause famine and war around the world that result in real world deaths, but we brush them off because it means we in the West can have cheap clothes, food and petrol.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"30 July 2011","score":"","review":" The important thing is that I enjoyed this film. It has 4 entertaining stories of unequal qualities that involve the character played by Jim Carey.The first story is about a screen writer whose unimpressive work is a B-movie that has a swashbuckling hero sword-fighting with a stereotypical villain to rescue a damsel in distress. It's the 1950's and our writer loses his job in the anti-communist witch hunt. There is no real character development in this sub-plot. It is just there to set up a memorable film-within-the-film and to introduce the subject of the Hollywood blacklist.The second story tells of the screen writer losing his memory and then ostensibly rediscovering his identity as Luke, the long lost war hero of a small American town. This is the major part of the film and it is very well worked. The supporting characters are more than mere walk-ons. There are strong parts for Luke's father, the town mayor, the doctor and his daughter who was Luke's fiancé, and a jealous rival. Jim Carey only needs to play surprised at their revelations which seem consistent and in their own way convincing. The utopia of Luke's hero status is reminiscent of the utopia of the film Pleasantville, and just like in that film it will be shattered.The third story is about restoring the town's derelict cinema, the Majestic of the title. It is an obvious nod to the classic Cinema Paradiso but without the magic of that film's pathos. Luke's memory loss was the foundation for the second story but it drains the third story of drama.The fourth and last story has great potential but it shows up the film's weakness which is its miscasting of Jim Carey. The first story provided the set-up for two arrivals the B-movie arrives at the cinema and triggers Luke's lost memory of who he is, and the witch hunters from Washington arrive on cue. In classic Hollywood style there is a confrontation in court between the power figures and the lone individual with right on his side.

It has 4 entertaining stories of unequal qualities that involve the character played by Jim Carey.The first story is about a screen writer whose unimpressive work is a B-movie that has a swashbuckling hero sword-fighting with a stereotypical villain to rescue a damsel in distress. It's the 1950's and our writer loses his job in the anti-communist witch hunt. There is no real character development in this sub-plot. It is just there to set up a memorable film-within-the-film and to introduce the subject of the Hollywood blacklist.The second story tells of the screen writer losing his memory and then ostensibly rediscovering his identity as Luke, the long lost war hero of a small American town. This is the major part of the film and it is very well worked. The supporting characters are more than mere walk-ons. There are strong parts for Luke's father, the town mayor, the doctor and his daughter who was Luke's fiancé, and a jealous rival. Jim Carey only needs to play surprised at their revelations which seem consistent and in their own way convincing. The utopia of Luke's hero status is reminiscent of the utopia of the film Pleasantville, and just like in that film it will be shattered.The third story is about restoring the town's derelict cinema, the Majestic of the title. It is an obvious nod to the classic Cinema Paradiso but without the magic of that film's pathos. Luke's memory loss was the foundation for the second story but it drains the third story of drama.The fourth and last story has great potential but it shows up the film's weakness which is its miscasting of Jim Carey. The first story provided the set-up for two arrivals the B-movie arrives at the cinema and triggers Luke's lost memory of who he is, and the witch hunters from Washington arrive on cue.

The story follows the highs and lows of Lester's life and gives perspectives on many different character relationships that are responsible for his current and future state. The films main theme is that it is never too late to feel passion in your life; sometimes it just takes a little spark.The story follows Lester on his daily life and his interactions with his family and friends. The film shows the perspectives of his wife Carolyn, who is a fanatic realtor who is obsessed with perfection and success. The drive and motivation for material success only separates Lester and her even more causing the couple to drift apart. This strain and discontent is one part of his life that fuels him to change. Lester also has become distant from his daughter is like most teenagers and has a hard time relating and understanding her parents. The films portrayal of Jane, Lester's daughter parallels the main character's story and provides multiple relationship perspectives. The story shows her lack of passion for anything and the spark is about to move in next door.The film follows a main theme of enlightenment or gaining a lost perspective or finding that lost passion that I think we all can relate to. This powerful universal concept is what has defined every one of the characters. Lester represents the average American male that is fed up with his life, who, during his daughter's sporting event noticed her friend which sparked a newfound purpose and understanding in his life. This montage or motif defined Lester learning or re-experiencing a lost feeling. The use of rose petals and curious music showed the passion and lust for life that he has been missing, is starting to return. This music is replayed during the film to show similar feelings and understanding.The film takes another turn when it shows the complex relationship between their new neighbor Ricky and his father. The story shows a strained relationship that clearly has been tested over the years and shows the struggle for a young man to understand and please his father. The film shows the view of a military man who wants to control his life and everyone around him, but he hiding the fact that he is a homosexual and has a hard time relating to his son. Colonel Fits represents the concept of don't believe what you see on the outside when it comes to your neighbor. I thought the film did a great job showing the inability for Colonel Fits to understand and relate to anyone around him and that ultimately led to his demise. The film also used various cuts from Ricky's video camera. This grainy footage was very important in showing the reality of teen behavior and gave a glimpse into the mind of a young couple who is rebelling against their parents.Overall this film was excellent and showed a glimpse into an American family and how their complicated relationships work. I think we all reach a point sometime in our life where we just stop, look around and ask yourself a question, how did I get here and where am I going? , that is what makes the film so powerful, the universal theme of finding the lost passion and purpose in our daily lives and relationships.

William Hurt and Kathleen Turner appear as one of the most seductive on screen couples in cinema history as Ned Racine and Matty Walker. Ned meets Matty one night and after putting forth some effort the two begin having an affair. Ned and Matty eventually fall so madly in love that they conspire to murder Matty's rich husband, Edmund. The murder and the events that follow it spark a chain of events that grow more and more suspenseful as the whole plan caves in around the two lovers. It's a film that prides itself on being a glorious homage to film noir, even if the results aren't completely satisfying.There are moments in Body Heat that I really loved. The suspense is played up excellently and the sensuality combined with the film noir atmosphere was excellent. This is a very moody, very atmospheric, film in general and it never forgets what kind of film it is, but the idea gets old after a while. When the awe towards the zesty and striking mood of the film wears off we are left trying to scramble together the plot which has been developing slowly and twistedly. The plot of Body Heat is a little convoluted as things never really seem to come together. Questions will be raised and the plot will grow thicker and thicker, never solving much of anything and always introducing and reintroducing characters whose motives and purpose we were never quite sure of from the beginning.The whole plot arc of the film isn't bad in theory, but its execution comes through a little hazy, not to mention that there is actually a literal haze over the film which gets a little distracting. Perhaps my problems with this film are all my own fault. I didn't keep up with the story as well as I probably should have and I got lost here and there. Thus I was a little bored at times, wishing the film would pick up and the plot would get somewhere. I'm not positive who is at fault. Me or the film? Either way, my final opinions on Body Heat are less than satisfactory, despite there being some obvious potential in the film.I probably need to rewatch Body Heat and this time keep up with everything that happens in the film and listen closely to every line of dialogue so that I can get the full affect of this film. All I got out of it on my first watch was an engaging atmosphere and some fantastic performances from William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. Other than that the film sort of lost me as I really hoped for more. But I commend it for its efforts and its keen ability to capture an atmosphere that really does work for this type of film, just not as much for me.

This sums up the very essence of the 'Western Spaghetti', a pivotal sub-genre that traced the singular evolution, hence the survival, of the Western genre in two polar opposite directions  the anticonformity and the overconformity or let's just simplify and say demystification and amplification.DEMYSTIFACTION Akira Kurosawa's innovative Yojinbo ended the classic 'good vs. bad' antagonism, which directly inspired Sergio Leone. Like A Fistful of Dollars, the realism of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly lies within the lack of morality of the three main characters, each of them has malicious motives. Leone's intuition over using Kurosawa's characterizations proved to be useful for the Western genre that was begging for a metamorphosis. John Ford's era was over, and with all due respect to John Wayne, everyone knew how the West was Won, and were tired of the pompous idealism displayed, despite the breath-taking imagery of Monument Valley. Even the mythic Civil War, the powerful symbol of the fraternal fight that ultimately consolidated the American spirit, is treated like a vulgar subplot, which somewhat betrays the foreign aspect of the film, and in the same way, sweeps off all the dust of semi-propaganda stuff disguised in entertainment. The myth was agonizing, and the 'Western Spaghetti' genre proceeded to a sort of creative destruction.Take the three main characters, the irony in the title, is that all their 'nicknames' are interchangeable, there is something ugly in the bad, and vice versa, and the good isn't 'boy-scout' good. Listen to the opening credits, flute for Blondie, Clint Eastwood as the Good, ocarina for Sentenza, Lee Van Cleef as the Bad and human voices for Eli Wallach as Tuco, the Ugly. Different instruments were used for each but they all play the same iconic melody, inspired from the howling of a coyote. Symbolically, each character is different, but the deadly greed inhabiting their hearts is the same, it's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly rather than The Good vs. the Bad vs. the Ugly. Their relationships are all tactical, cynical and hypocritical, with friendships based on a mutual need to reach a hidden gold. The Good and the Bad need each other, because they know half the secret about the gold's location, and Sentenza, need them alive to find it. They're all tied to each other until the strongest and cleverest wins; this was the humanistic reality during the dark ages of the last century.AMPLIFICATION I guess the fact that I watched it for the first time when I was 10, built my personal affection to the film, because at that age, my expectations were not tarnished by the cynicism of the classic know-it-all film buff. For me, the three characters were not similar; the Good was the hero, the Bad, the villain, and the Ugly, the comic relief. They happen to be the only recognizable actors' faces in the film, but it hardly matters because we don't need them overshadowed by other supporting performances. Eli Wallach, in a career-defining role, is the fastest talking and provides the best moments of the film as the indisputable scene stealer. His humor also relies on the exciting duo he formed with Blondie whose cool sense of humor, and cynical detachment proved at many occasions to be the yin to Tuco's yang. And Lee Van Cleef is the senseless, cold-blooded killer who makes the Ugly look Good. He represents the dark side of the film, a man who always finishes his job, and from the first scene involving him, I took him as the bad guy of the story. The characterization is why I loved the film both as a kid and as a movie buff.The line between amplification and parody is very thin, but there's a difference. When parody takes all the conventions into derision, amplification insists on them, providing the typical Leonesque shots. Time is dilated, locations are magnified, like belonging to a unique dimension, and the whole film oscillates between extreme close-ups and extended shots from very far away. All the effects are amplified with cinematic hyperbolas exceeding the limit of believability. In his 'Great Movies' review, Ebert stated that Leone invented a rule which consisted on the characters' point of view limited by the screen. I never understood until I re-watched the film and got it, and I respect Leone even more for having pushed the limits of creativity to this point since most of the greatest effects from the film depend on that rule, and are transcended by the iconic score of the musical genius, Ennio Morricone. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly has all the tragic, comic, epic and musical elements that makes it a kind of operatic masterpiece.CONCLUSION Film-making is far from being an exact science, and you can make a masterpiece out of the least complex plot elements, the lowest budget, and the cleverest directorial tricks. Not to diminish the quality of Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly but the point is that the movie works as if it was self-aware of its own restrictions and transcended it with a magic that another director, wouldn't have judged necessary. Some apparent weaknesses are sometimes the necessary drivers to push the creation to the limit of genius while confidence can work as a tricky obstacle, maybe that explains why The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the highest ranked Western on IMDb Top 250 and undoubtedly the most iconic.So, to conclude, I would simply say that there's two kinds of people in this world, those who love the film, and those who don't get it ...

The myth was agonizing, and the 'Western Spaghetti' genre proceeded to a sort of creative destruction.Take the three main characters, the irony in the title, is that all their 'nicknames' are interchangeable, there is something ugly in the bad, and vice versa, and the good isn't 'boy-scout' good. Listen to the opening credits, flute for Blondie, Clint Eastwood as the Good, ocarina for Sentenza, Lee Van Cleef as the Bad and human voices for Eli Wallach as Tuco, the Ugly. Different instruments were used for each but they all play the same iconic melody, inspired from the howling of a coyote. Symbolically, each character is different, but the deadly greed inhabiting their hearts is the same, it's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly rather than The Good vs. the Bad vs. the Ugly. Their relationships are all tactical, cynical and hypocritical, with friendships based on a mutual need to reach a hidden gold. The Good and the Bad need each other, because they know half the secret about the gold's location, and Sentenza, need them alive to find it. They're all tied to each other until the strongest and cleverest wins; this was the humanistic reality during the dark ages of the last century.AMPLIFICATION I guess the fact that I watched it for the first time when I was 10, built my personal affection to the film, because at that age, my expectations were not tarnished by the cynicism of the classic know-it-all film buff. For me, the three characters were not similar; the Good was the hero, the Bad, the villain, and the Ugly, the comic relief. They happen to be the only recognizable actors' faces in the film, but it hardly matters because we don't need them overshadowed by other supporting performances. Eli Wallach, in a career-defining role, is the fastest talking and provides the best moments of the film as the indisputable scene stealer. His humor also relies on the exciting duo he formed with Blondie whose cool sense of humor, and cynical detachment proved at many occasions to be the yin to Tuco's yang. And Lee Van Cleef is the senseless, cold-blooded killer who makes the Ugly look Good. He represents the dark side of the film, a man who always finishes his job, and from the first scene involving him, I took him as the bad guy of the story. The characterization is why I loved the film both as a kid and as a movie buff.The line between amplification and parody is very thin, but there's a difference. When parody takes all the conventions into derision, amplification insists on them, providing the typical Leonesque shots. Time is dilated, locations are magnified, like belonging to a unique dimension, and the whole film oscillates between extreme close-ups and extended shots from very far away. All the effects are amplified with cinematic hyperbolas exceeding the limit of believability. In his 'Great Movies' review, Ebert stated that Leone invented a rule which consisted on the characters' point of view limited by the screen. I never understood until I re-watched the film and got it, and I respect Leone even more for having pushed the limits of creativity to this point since most of the greatest effects from the film depend on that rule, and are transcended by the iconic score of the musical genius, Ennio Morricone. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly has all the tragic, comic, epic and musical elements that makes it a kind of operatic masterpiece.CONCLUSION Film-making is far from being an exact science, and you can make a masterpiece out of the least complex plot elements, the lowest budget, and the cleverest directorial tricks. Not to diminish the quality of Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly but the point is that the movie works as if it was self-aware of its own restrictions and transcended it with a magic that another director, wouldn't have judged necessary. Some apparent weaknesses are sometimes the necessary drivers to push the creation to the limit of genius while confidence can work as a tricky obstacle, maybe that explains why The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the highest ranked Western on IMDb Top 250 and undoubtedly the most iconic.So, to conclude, I would simply say that there's two kinds of people in this world, those who love the film, and those who don't get it ...

But I only saw the movie on TV, it was one of the rare movies I didn't have on VHS. So I hadn't seen the film since I was a kid, but I noticed while I was at the store that they had Matilda on DVD for five dollars. I didn't really hesitate to buy it and feel some good old nostalgia. Being a kid of the 90's was an awesome time, we had some great shows and this was the last time where movies were very cutting edge and not afraid to scare or to not insult the audience's intelligence. I couldn't wait to watch this again thinking that this film was so cutting edge at the time, but now realizing as an adult, this film is kinda mean spirited.Matilda is an intelligent child; however, her gifts are unappreciated by her family. She is left alone in the house all day while her father Harry, works as a crooked car dealer, her mother Zinnia goes to play bingo and her bullying older brother Michael goes to school. Matilda is enrolled at Crunchem Hall Elementary School, where children are routinely terrorized by the cruel principal, Trunchbull. But Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey, is a kind and caring woman. Miss Honey attempts to appeal to Miss Trunchbull and Matilda's parents, but they refuse to listen. Matilda realizes she has developed extraordinary powerful telekinesis. After she gains more and more control of her new-found telekinetic ability by practicing, she decides that it's no more Miss Nice Girl.I don't know, as a child this movie was so amazing to me. I think it means something; this was a movie that was totally meant for the children. Even though I think that this was somewhat disturbing for young kids, it's still a fun fantasy. As a child, it seems like a daily thing where you're constantly reminded of how you're not important or you're too small or too young to do things. Also when the adults get busy, not saying Matilda's family was out of control with the self absorbency, but it's easy to feel neglected. It's a great idea to think that you could have super powers and make the adults pay for the mean acts that they've done to you; it's awesome for a child.As an adult, this movie seems a little too mean spirited. The family isn't just mean, they're beyond cruel, and not saying that some families can't be like that, but it's just a bit much and hard to believe that from their cruelness Matilda is a sweet girl. The principal is just out of control and granted this is a fantasy, but again, it seems like she's insane crazy out of control where in the real world not only would she be fired as principal for abusing the students but arrested. And I was wondering if she hates children so much, why is she a principal? Also the way Miss Honey accepts Matilda having these disturbing powers was a little too easy as well as the children accepting it and laughing at it. Matilda's brother tries to throw a carrot at her and she uses her power to make him choke on the carrot, no matter that it's meant as funny, I thought it was weird. I think this film is fun for the kids as a fantasy but as an adult I grew out of the love I had for this film. I wouldn't dismiss it, at least for the kids, but for the adults, I think it's safe to say that it wasn't meant for the grown ups.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 July 2011","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I remember as a child watching Matilda, I thought it was the coolest movie and wished so badly to be like Matilda.

She has been without a housekeeper for quite some time. The prospect of getting someone to come work in her suburban home as a live-in maid, appears to be Sophie, a young woman she interviews for the job as the story begins. The quiet Sophie shows promise, although Catherine does not emphasize she is taking her on a trial basis. Sophie turns out to be a terrific worker and a good cook to boot. There is one problem though, we realize she is an illiterate young woman who cannot read. Little written reminders pose a threat to her because she has no idea what is being asked for her to do. The generous LeLIevres offer to pay for her driving lessons, something she refuses because she has bad eyes. No problem, they will pay for an eye checkup! One day Sophie meets Jeanne, a woman that is a gossip and a snoop. She has the perfect job working at the post office where she is able to open the mail to her heart's content. Jeanne sees in Sophie a kindred spirit. What's more, she has discovered a secret the Lelievre's maid has told no one. Sophie was involved in a fire in the house where she was living with her older infirm father, who died in the sinister. Sophie, who might have done the deed, is not accused of anything. Yet Jeanne knows about it. Jeanne, a woman with a shady past, becomes Sophie's ally.In the meantime, things begin to change somewhat for Sophie at the Lelievres. One day, she decides to leave Catherine to fend for herself during a birthday party at the house because she must go out with Jeanne. Daughter Melinda discovers the problem with Sophie. Thinking the maid is dyslexic, she offers to help her, but Sophie overreacts by telling Melinda she knows she is hiding her pregnancy from her parents.Georges Lelievre finally explodes when he learns that Jeanne, the woman that has been reading his correspondence is being entertained at his house by Sophie. He fires her, but lets her stay for a few days. A bad decision that will backfire on him and the family. Jeanne, clearly upset by not being able to come to the house, visits one night as the family prepares to watch Don Giovanni on a televised broadcast which they are also recording on a portable device. That visit comes with terrible consequences for all the people involved.Claude Chabrol's adapted Ruth Rendell's novel A Judgment in Stone with Caroline Eliacheff, transferring the locale from England to his beloved Brittany. The adapters put more emphasis on the class differences between the well-to-do Lelievres and Sophie, even though the employers were more than generous. The novel had another flavor, but for those that have not read the original text, this is a wonderful way to get acquainted with the Ruth Rendell work. In fact, having read the novel years before the film came out, we went back to reread it after we watched the film.Sandrine Bonnaire is quite a contrast for the original Eunice Parchman. In the novel, Eunice is a vulgar woman whose attitude toward any kindness the people she worked for bestowed on her was received with resentment. The Sophie in the film version shows a more sophisticated approach, in comparison with Eunice. Ms. Bonnaire, one of France's leading actresses does what the director wanted of her, but it is hard to believe her Sophie could be illiterate. Working with Isabelle Huppert came easy for Claude Chabrol, after all, they collaborated a lot in the films they did together. Some of Ms. Huppert's best work can be seen in films directed by Chabrol. Jacqueline Bisset and Jean-Pierre Cassel are wonderful as the Lelievres. Virginie Ledoyen and Valentin Merlet play Melinda and Gilles respectively. Bernard Zitzermann's camera photographs the area in vivid detail, enhancing the film.

One reviewer comments that there are too many crises but I don't think that you can have too many as long as you keep them logical. When the crane comes down, it drags the rig to the edge of the abyss, but some have said that there is no way that the crane could have pulled something the size of the drilling platform. As is typical of Cameron, he seems to interweave interesting philosophy into his movies. He opens the Abyss with a quote from Neizsche (who is dead) which is about the emptiness of the human soul. He doesn't seem to really pick up on this point, but what we do have is a scenario in which the world is on the brink of an abyss, which is world war III. Unfortunately the original version doesn't play this out so it comes out as more of an underwater adventure. When the World War III scenario is put into the movie we can see how there is two layers to this movie. On one side the rig is perching on the brink of the abyss while the world is hotting up for a really hot war. Then there are the aliens. They seem to take a back seat in all of this, but they are the reason as to why the war is starting up. Yet aliens are not exactly something that we encounter everyday, so even though there is a lot of evidence that what they are facing underwater is not human technology, the Navy Seals do not want to believe it. The Russian Water Tentacle, as is so aptly put, does not convince the commander that the aliens are peaceful, so he decides to blow them up. On a third level there is the relationship between two of the characters. They begin on the brink of divorce, another metaphorical abyss, and the underwater adventure, where they face each other dying, reunites them. Both of them are stubborn, but brought together on this rig amidst the dangers that they face, including loosing each other. What I thought at the end though was that even though these events brought them together, will it keep them together for twenty, thirty, or even forty more years?

(1988) * 1\/2 (out of 4) The title pretty much sums up this remake of the 1949 noir classic. This time out Dennis Quaid plays a teacher going through the worse period of his life as he can't get a book published and his wife is leaving him but things get even darker after being poisoned and learning that he's got less than 24-hours to life. In that time he decides to try and track down the person or persons who poisoned him along with the help of one of his students (Meg Ryan). The original film is one of the all-time great classics but many movies were getting remade during the 80s and many of them were quite good (THE THING, THE FLY, THE BLOB) but others were less than memorable and that's where D.O.A. falls. Many people considered this one of the worst films of the years and it's hard to try and fight that because this is one pretty lousy movie from start to finish. This is really one of those mysteries that's quite annoying because everyone you meet is a red herring and not once did I ever feel as if the screenwriters had a good idea as to where they were going because the entire storyline just seemed like one big mess and in the end they could have had anyone be the killer and it wouldn't have made any less sense than someone else. I won't reveal the ending but it's quite laughable and you can't help but really be mad that you've wasted so much time with the picture just to get to this conclusion. Directors ***** try to add some style to the picture but this never works and quite often it's just as annoying as everything else going on. There are some fancy camera moves and some quick edits but they add nothing to the picture. The opening and closing sequences are in B&W and I'm guessing this was done to try and give the viewers a throwback to the old days but it does nothing to enhance the film. The film actually contains some fine actors but none of them are given much to work with. Quaid, one of my favorites, pretty much sleepwalks through the picture and it never really appears he knows what to do with the character. Ryan is pretty bland in one of her early roles and the shocking thing is that she has no chemistry with Quaid. Daniel Stern, Charlotte Rampling and Jane Kaczmarek round out the supporting cast. One of the most annoying things about the picture is its soundtrack, which features some great tracks but these songs really don't mix well with the story or anything going on. I'm not one that goes against remakes but this here is one that can be skipped. Check out the original instead.

Lester, his daughter Jane, and his wife Carolyn seem to be a normal happy family to everyone on the outside. They have good jobs, and live in a nice house in nice neighborhood. However, on the inside Lester has become depressed, and with no help from his family who seems to hate him, he continues to fall into a deeper depression. Carolyn is obsessed with her job and materialistic things, and has a budding relationship with a rival real estate agent. Jane is a typical hormonal teenager, and begins a relationship with Ricky Fits, the new neighbor boy who is a drug dealer with a very strict and homophobic marine father. At a basketball game, Lester meets his daughter's friend Angela, and instantly becomes infatuated with her. After this meeting, the movie takes a twist and Lester starts making drastic changes in his life. Some of these changes seem good for him, but not everyone else agrees.The best theme for this movie would be happiness. It is wanted by every character in this movie, they all just want it in a different way. Carolyn believed that to be successful you had to pretend to be happy on the outside, so she expected Lester and Jane to act the same way. This way of thinking didn't carry on throughout the whole movie, because when Lester made the changes in his life he made sure his family and everyone else knew it, he refused to be bullied by his wife and daughter, and made sure they understood that. He was the only character in this movie that did what he had to do to make himself happy. Keeping on track with this theme, a movie similar to American Beauty would be Fight Club. The main character in both movies is a depressed man who hates his life and mostly everything in it. Both characters make drastic changes, including quitting their job, to try to find happiness. You could say that both Lester and Edward Norton's character in Fight Club are a bit crazy.Two film techniques that help support this theme in American Beauty would be music, and motifs. Throughout most of the movie whenever Lester is seeing Angela either in person or in his dreams there is music playing in the background, most of the time this music sounds whimsical and grabs the viewer's attention. We notice that every time Lester sees Angela he seems happier. Another technique used is motifs. Throughout the movie the same idea of Angela is shown in Lester's mind, a sort of sexual fantasy. He is usually shown smiling happily whenever he is having these ideas. Also, there are always rose petals in these scenes, another pattern used throughout the whole movie.To me, this whole movie is about trying to find happiness. It just shows that people go about it in different ways. Some people are completely fine living an unhappy life as long as they seem successful to everyone else on the outside. While some people will do whatever it takes to find happiness, even if this means turning their life upside down.

To help conceal their identities, he requires the men not to reveal any personal information with each other and assigns them names of color.The story begins in the middle which appears to be a friendly group of mobsters hanging out like your typical scene in heist movie Ocean Eleven. The viewer is brought up to speed through the movies flashback editorial cutting and realizes there is not the same camaraderie among these men. They are reluctant to place trust in each other even though the heist plan seems to have no faults.The men's fear of deception is validated when the plans go wrong and the jewelry heist becomes a shootout. The jewelry store was ambushed by the police leading the men to believe that one of them is a rat. Although most of the violent action is off screen in this part of the movie, the dialog guides the viewer.At the warehouse rendezvous the men are conflicted and the paranoia is heightened as they begin speculating who is to blame and who they can trust. The movie continues to flashback revealing to the audience the truth. The intense dialog, the scene setting and the crude violence at the warehouse allows the audience to better understand the characters position on the failed heist.Notorious in most mobster movies, extreme acts of violence occur while attempting to discover the rat among them. This movie is graphic in filming the horrific torture scene which captures the ruthless behavior of the character Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) and the massive amount of blood lost by his victim as well as the blood pool spilling around wounded Mr. Orange (Tim Roth). If you're a viewer with a weak stomach it may be too much to view. In the scenes of Mr.White (Harvey Keitel) in the warehouse it is conveyed through close ups and dialog that he is conflicted with following his gut instinct to help the wounded Mr. Orange or face the possible consequences. Although as a viewer you know the truth but find yourself hoping for the best.

I've seen it a couple of times, but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago, The Godfather was in the Number #1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and second, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I've come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like On The Waterfront, To Kill a Mockingbird and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I may have to reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don't mind doing every now and then as situations warrant.Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know it's pretty cliché to state it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the directing and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen's release and new prisoner Tommy's introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andy's quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The story transcends one man's confinement for a crime he didn't commit, and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967's Cool Hand Luke, but his method was self destructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so.But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who started out believing that 'hope can drive a man insane'.I really can't recommend this picture highly enough, both for it's masterful story telling and it's technical execution. The actors, even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. They deliver a seamless performance that's virtually unmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance.

No, it's not a perverse screwball comedy. It's a charming and heartwarming dramedy that manages to make us laugh but not without forgetting what is important the characters and the story. In Wonder Boys Michael Douglas plays English Professor Grady Tripp. Tripp's wife has just left him and now he must survive the onslaught of problems coming his way, such as a strangely unhinged student he has reluctantly taken under his wing and the arrival of his editor who has been waiting on his book for seven years, a book he hasn't even finished yet. Tripp gets himself into one crazy situation after another as they slowly lead him to discover who he really is. It's a quirky little tale of love and life. One that makes us laugh as well as think.Whether you want to believe it or not, we all need a film like Wonder Boys every once in a while. It's a film that isn't too terribly complex, it isn't stern and serious, it's lighthearted and really just has a good time while not being an overly simplistic and too easygoing. This is a film full of wit and charm and it just enjoys itself as it moves along a straightforward path that doesn't need a lot of intense focus to stay on. But there is still a lot you can get out of this film if you sit back and enjoy. There are plenty of laughs along the way, but also a smart and human story that moves us and makes us feel like we are accomplishing something by watching this film.However, there was a certain point towards the middle of Wonder Boys where I finally had to ask myself, Where is all this going? After a while I started to feel like there was no real point to any of what was happening, as entertaining and engaging as it all was. I would say that this film's only purpose was to entertain, except for the fact that there is a constant undertone of serious feeling and movement in the film which makes one think that there is something larger at work here. But after a while the characters seem to be stuck in a repetitive state of moving from one situation to another, not learning anything and not actually growing as much as the film would like us to believe. And then by the end of the film I feel like we should have learned something, but in reality the final message is hollow.I'm not saying Wonder Boys is a bad film in any way. It just doesn't seem to have the impact it shoots for in its attempt at a serious subtext. But on the surface the film is a lot of fun with some great scenes and fantastic characters. The film is entertaining from start to finish with great dialogue and fantastic performances from great actors like Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, Frances McDormand, and the ever illustrious Robert Downey Jr.. I really enjoyed Wonder Boys despite some issues that the film may have had. All in all, there are things I love about this film and then things that I wasn't too fond of in retrospect. This probably isn't a film I would watch again but in no way do I regret watching it once. ","genre":null},{"date":"30 July 2011","score":"","review":" Transvestites, pot, funny looking midgets.
