Let me explain first, why you shouldn't trust this as an adaptation of the novels by Anne Rice. The film makers think they stayed true to the spirit of the books. But how could it be possible, if they don't respect anything about the books?Most of the original character's personalities are totally altered or reversed; especially Jesse has no personality characteristics in common with the novel version what-so-ever. Lestat, who in the novel is joyous and happy, and becomes a rock star to see what happens and to do good for the world by revealing secrets of evil... is suicidally depressed in this film!! Marius is aggressive and cold, though in the novels he is very loving and gentle, especially with Lestat, and would never ever do some things he does in this film. Does that sound like sticking to the books's spirit and adapting the books's characters into a story adapted from the books?But then, what the heck, they also completely rewrote the guts of the story - the producers himself uses that phrasing about the matter. Completely rewriting something that crucial, isn't adapting. Rewrite 'the GUTS' of the story, says the producer. Tthat is in other words 'multilating the insides'. As in, butchering. They butchered the books and they admit it! They just don't give flying *beep* about it! But still, they talk about the production as if it was adapting type and this film is unfairly advertised as Anne Rice's though pretty much only the names are in common with her work. It's very misleading for others and very infuriating for some of the passionate The Vampire Chronicles fans, who usually are already dropping heads for the butcher in itself.I find it funny the producer complained about information overload as for why they couldn't stay more loyal to the books - yet they waste half of the film on something that wasn't in the book(s) at all. I'm talking about the so called romance between the characters Lestat and Jessica.Those minutes they could've used for real information from the books, on the Queen of who the title is about and the vampire history. Not only is that history important but it would've also given a lot of awesome atmosphere for this film as a vampire film as well. But even without this actually does work. You are only left to use your own imagination and speculations, which should not be all that bad thing.I think some changes they made good and working perfectly for the film since they were not really adapting the books anyway. They changed the person who makes Lestat into a vampire - that change just serves the film's limited amount of minutes so well, and even for the characters that was perfect. Even when comparing to the novels. (I have in-depth analyzed Lestat and that character's relationship in the novels, for two years.) This film however lacks showing how excellent substitute maker he is, because they abused the original characters' personalities.)Can't compare Townsend and Cruise as Lestat. They had completely different scripts in their hands Cruise had a wonderful script helped by the author herself. Townsend has a horrible mess of a butcher from a production that literally told Anne that they'd do whatever they want. And since that was a story completely different than in the books, it wouldn't have made any difference if Townsend had read the books. It's the story what makes the character who it is. But it's undeniable that Tom Cruise did put 100 times more passion into his portrayal, than Townsend did. But ST still makes a very fine Gothic rock star vampire and showed potential for a true Lestat in the very few in-character moments that were left for him in the film.As an independent film this is a pain because it's full of old clich√©s, which however could be bearable if only they had a logic storyline & relationships there, but it's all utter nonsense! Above all the Lestat\/Jesse paiting they have there. Lestat clearly hates the woman and has every reason to, and he doesn't even imply at any point that he'd be interested in her in any emotional way - actually at all as a person. I don't know what the film makers were smoking when they made the certain two scenes, which had NO realistic development into them. In fact, one of them had a moment that totally contradicts something very crucial that Lestat had said in the same scene, like 5 seconds earlier! WTF!? I repeat; I don't know what the writers were smoking. And why there is no realistic development for the Lestat\/Jesse relationship, is because the characters had NO romantic nor sexual chemistry what-so-ever, while they also meet only twice before the ending and they're both loaded with negative emotion from Lestat's side.This works well as a vampire movie in general - but if you want to introduce yourself to Anne Rice's Queen of the Damned and The Vampire Lestat - this film is not the way. If you do not know the books, and can ignore utter nonsense, you're probably the one enjoying this the most. And if you are a fan of the book - do keep open mind and think before you judge.The cast; everyone are great in their roles. They would've just deserved more true versions of their characters! I especially love Stuart Townsend as Lestat and Vincent Perez as Marius. The atmosphere of this film is darkly romantic. The music is hooking.Pick this film if you like vampires and you don't have anything else but this and Twilight at hand. Because, the two are the worst you could waste your time with, but this one is superior to Twilight, as this has actually vampires in this.

This is a bandwagon film. It's cool to rave about how life changing and beautiful of a masterpiece it is. Some even go so far as to say that this is the greatest film ever made (or one of them at least).Sorry, but the emperor has no clothes.I'm a fan of Kubrick. He does amazing work in general.

When entering the medium of film, I would say that it's almost impossible to convey the entire character of Humbert without the narration. Unfortunately, and it pains me to say this, Kubrick didn't even come close. It's most easily understood that this movie got all of the plot line of Lolita, but none of the substance behind it.This movie focuses on only one real role of Humbert and that is Humbert the father. In the book, it is impossible to picture Humbert as JUST a father; he is also a justified pedophile, a nymphologist, a cultured intellectual, and most importantly, a murderer. Nabokov left the murder scene for last in the novel in order to demonstrate a build-up of malaise in Humbert. When Kubrick put the murder scene first, it makes it easy to forget by the time you reach the conclusion of the film that Humbert is capable of murder.Not only is the development of Humbert neglected, but so is Lolita's. When we encounter Lolita as a pregnant 18-year-old in the book, Nabokov paints the scene with Lolita being a much more mature and developed character. Kubrick, however, portrays her as the same 12-year-old we spent the movie with.I also can't blame everything on Kubrick. Cultural trends at the time of the movie didn't exactly allow for the full exposition of ALL the vulgar subject matter contained in the novel. Quite frankly, the sex with minors theme was so kept under the surface, I probably would have completely missed it had I not read the novel first.

Last of the Mohicans just barely falls short of 4-star caliber, but recognizing that it is not quite perfect, I still hold this as one of my favorite 20 films, maybe even top 10 for me. The flaws are very minor. It has a very epic story, but it isn't presented on screen in the most epic manner. The scenes, cuts, and camera angles are just a little weak. I would of liked more widescreen, epic-type shots. The love story has to develop, and it sort of slows the pace of the film. But not too bad at all. That's almost nitpicking. The writing and dialogue is decent at times; it doesn't have enough impactful lines throughout. The characters do not have the greatest depth to them, but doesn't that sort of play to the ending, that the star of the final scene was a side character who barely spoke. I thought the ending was brilliant obviously. No one can argue that the final half-hour or so of this film isn't absolutely awesome. The score during the end is great. Daniel Day Lewis is phenomenal like in all of his roles. Madeleine Stowe is strong. There are 3 distinct scenes that make this movie for me, the waterfall scene, the ambush\/battle scene, and the end. Those scenes are all A+ quality and the ending is one of the best ever. It's certain parts of other scenes that barely lessen the film. I agree that Last of the Mohicans just falls short of a masterpiece, but it should be well into the Top250; it is a shame that so many valuable flicks like this one get such low scores. Last of the Mohicans, Titanic, Apollo 13, among many others are getting seriously mistreated. To have a list of the best movies and leave out so many sure-fire classics almost spoils it all. But I can understand how the haters will hate for no reason on certain movies and hence destroy the rating, but Last of the Mohicans doesn't seem like the kind of film that would spawn many haters.

Last of the Mohicans just barely falls short of 4-star caliber, but recognizing that it is not quite perfect, I still hold this as one of my favorite 20 films, maybe even top 10 for me. The flaws are very minor. It has a very epic story, but it isn't presented on screen in the most epic manner. The scenes, cuts, and camera angles are just a little weak. I would of liked more widescreen, epic-type shots. The love story has to develop, and it sort of slows the pace of the film. But not too bad at all. That's almost nitpicking. The writing and dialogue is decent at times; it doesn't have enough impactful lines throughout. The characters do not have the greatest depth to them, but doesn't that sort of play to the ending, that the star of the final scene was a side character who barely spoke. I thought the ending was brilliant obviously. No one can argue that the final half-hour or so of this film isn't absolutely awesome. The score during the end is great. Daniel Day Lewis is phenomenal like in all of his roles. Madeleine Stowe is strong. There are 3 distinct scenes that make this movie for me, the waterfall scene, the ambush\/battle scene, and the end. Those scenes are all A+ quality and the ending is one of the best ever. It's certain parts of other scenes that barely lessen the film. I agree that Last of the Mohicans just falls short of a masterpiece, but it should be well into the Top250; it is a shame that so many valuable flicks like this one get such low scores. Last of the Mohicans, Titanic, Apollo 13, among many others are getting seriously mistreated. To have a list of the best movies and leave out so many sure-fire classics almost spoils it all.

For one thing, thanks to her father's fame, experience and connections, Coppola was not going into this blind or alone and there was no need to reinvent the wheel.

This has to be a fault of the writing; however, not having read the novel, I cannot say whether that is a fault of Coppola's or of Eugenides's. Whatever the case, no acting could possibly have saved these girls.I'm not particularly bothered by the unrealistically sharp reaction of the mother during the second half, nor by the parents' equally unrealistic defense of the girls in the face of the public.

Apart from being beautiful and (mostly) innocent, there is really no life to any of these girls, nothing to be sucked out. As such, their destinies did very little to move me. But this wouldn't really be a problem if it weren't for the fact that the film tries to touch on the literal theme of suicide, not only through the commentaries of the observers wondering why but also through the film's halfhearted attempt at breathing life into one of the girls.Lux, Kirsten Dunst's character, is obviously supposed to be the exception in this soulless tribe. Unfortunately, her outlets for individuality--the typical teen-angst refuges of alcohol, tobacco, sex and rock music--are no less superficial than the insular half-acre plot she so desperately longs to escape. By the time the girls begin receiving the fliers for exotic vacations, it was too late in the film to convince me that any of them would know where to look for escapist fantasies or even be able to conceive of what a real escape would look like.In short, the script tries to do much in using egoism and suicide as a metaphor for the self-destructive insularity of suburban homesteads and at the same time touch on the literal aspects of what suicide is all about. Suicide is a horrific phenomenon stemming from terrible mental states and a film that attempts to deal with it on a literal level should definitely not banalise the reactions of the self-victim's entourage.The film makes heavy use of Roman Catholic iconography to seemingly little end. At first glance it seems the only thing it does is to give some sort of rationale for the parents' core beliefs about raising daughters, but there is no commentary on how these beliefs affect the course of action the mother's eventual crackdown makes almost no reference to religious justification. The priest who comforts Mrs. Lisbon after the suicide of her first daughter assures her that he listed Cecilia's death as an accident--in Catholicism, suicide is grounds for denying Christian rite of burial--and yet the viewer is not comforted one bit by this gentle but false cover-up. Contra the Catholic League, the commentary here is certainly not on religion itself but on the vacuousity of the religious life in American suburbs. Anyone who has spent considerable time living in the suburbs of the United States understands that religion is definitely IN but not OF them.Overall, it is a valiant first effort, though given the poor choice of source material I can't be sure whether this is Coppola's doing or simply the massive fountain of talent she has with her offering heavy padding.

Famous in Europe for his thrillers such as Knife in the Water (1962), Repulsion (1965), and Cul-de-sac (1966), Polanski's work in Rosemary's Baby is hailed by critics as pitch-perfect. The film is also consistently mentioned as one of the scariest horror films of all-time and a horror classic by film magazines and polls.Now, I am not quite favorable with these lavish praises on a film I would classify as a psychological drama rather than horror (in the purest sense of the word). But really, what is horror? What makes a film horrific? Is it scares that make you jump? Or is it the dreadful atmosphere of suspense? Or is it a conceptual idea that chills you? Are these definitions so subjective that it is only right to discount them? Or are they distinct parts that describe an increasingly vague genre?Rosemary's Baby tells the story of Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) who lives with her husband, Guy (John Cassavetes), in a newly bought apartment flat. Guy is a struggling television actor who, to the delight of Rosemary, finally wants a baby. They have an old couple for neighbors who are caring and generous, but their actions become more suspicious over time. Soon, a pregnant Rosemary starts to hallucinate, feels pain in her abdomen, and begins to suspect a cultish plot against her baby, or does she not? The horror comes from elements of Satanism and witchcraft. In a dream sequence halfway into the film, Polanski employs surrealistic images of what I would describe as the ritual raping of the protagonist by the Devil. In the final act, which I will not reveal in its entirety, Satan is hailed. However, it is important to note that Polanski's film is not a glorification of evil, but an inquiry into a person's psychological well-being and self-awareness.Polanski's fine direction allows the film to grow in psychological creepiness, and he does a steady balancing act attempting to suggest supernaturalism while retaining a strong sense of reality. Perhaps the best aspect of Rosemary's Baby, apart from the very faithful adaptation of its source material, is that the film is plausible enough to be taken seriously.The all-round excellent acting by the cast plays a large part in creating believable characters. Farrow, especially, gives us a character whose fears we can relate to. We are with her till the very end, to that famous and ambiguous last scene of her rocking the cradle. What lies inside the cradle is clearly the stuff of nightmares, but Polanski refuses to give us the money shot &#x96; the devil baby &#x96; which makes it all the more scarier by leaving it to our imagination.Generally, Rosemary's Baby is a decent film. But moments of cinematic brilliance that we have come to associate with a skillful director like Polanski are few. I find something lacking overall, of which I can't quite pinpoint. Perhaps it didn't live up to my expectations of a horror masterpiece. Or maybe the feeling of satisfaction was replaced by a sense of queasiness I felt towards its ambiguous ending.In a nutshell, Rosemary's Baby is good but not great.

The story is taken right out of Fleming's short story Risico and was basically remade in The Living Daylights 6 years later (which incidentally is better). I enjoy the fact that this film no longer makes fun of itself, it no longer makes a joke out of the character whom we all love and admire. The Moore films (through no fault of his own) for me are not what Bond is supposed to be and have warped many people's minds to what Bond is and yet For Your Eyes Only is a little oasis in between the shenanigans of Moonraker and the boredom of A View to a Kill. Julian Glover is good as the villain, but the main reason why I love this is the story. It is intelligent without being complicated and it keeps you interested. We'll forget about the fiasco of an opening, and sure this isn't a brilliant film but it does all the right things.

I've seen predictable, fun, stereotypical, touching and so on. All of these might be true but the key to the film is that it will endear itself to you. In the decade since I saw it for the first time I have likely seen it dozens of times and every time I simply fall in love with it all over again. The fact that it is a brilliantly clever retelling of Shakespeare's Taming of The Shrew only helps solidify it as a really fun, and better than other teen type flicks of the nineties or any other decade. The characters make this film what it is. Fun loving, over the top, and a very diverse group of people that everyone will easily find a favourite or more than one favourite character. The cast works so well together, and the story moves at such a perfectly entertaining and hilarious pace that you will just enjoy every minute. The film has the demographic of mid to late teens in mind certainly but it doesn't try and treat the audience like kids. The film has plenty of gross out humour, tastefully used of course, and a crass feel to it but some sort of life lesson about romance and growing up is firmly in place.The late Heath Ledger became a household name as the bad boy Patrick Verona with a heart of gold. Ledger is just absolutely charismatic in his role and is enough to make guys high five and girls swoon. I actually consider this character and Ledger's performance to be probably one of my favourite. Absolutely holding her own and matching Ledger's Verona shot for shot is the amazing Julia Stiles who gives probably her best performance or close to it as the vivacious, tempestuous Kat Stratford. Misunderstood, catty, angsty, brutally sarcastic and downright hilarious Stiles plays a strong willed, if not slightly flawed teenage girl who goes through a lot of growing up as a lot of the characters do. Stiles and Ledger are absolutely brilliant together and one of my all time favourite romantic comedy couples. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is quiet and subtle and almost too adorable as Cam. Even though he isn't as bold and strong a character as some of the other he is easily the sweetest in the film and will be plenty of people's favourite. If Stiles is the perfect match with Ledger then the perfect match for Gordon-Levitt would be the equally as sweet Larisa Oleynik. She is first presented as extremely vapid and shallow but quickly gets far more depth and gets to grow up a lot in the film. She learns some valuable lessons and her and Stiles are terrific together as siblings. David Krumholtz is deliciously geeky as Cam's new best friend Michael. He's downright hilarious and has some truly amazing moments and gets to have some great romance in the end as well. Andrew Keegan is hilarious as the conceited teen model Joey and the object of Bianca's (Oleynik) affection...at first. He is a bit of a villain to the story but certainly never much of a challenge to anyone as he gets shown up time and time again. And finally the absolutely amazing and hilarious Larry Miller who plays Stiles and Oleynik's insanely over protective father. He is one of my favourite Dad's and is absolutely perfect. I will forever remember him in this role.This cast just works so amazingly well together and everyone fits these perfect roles and brings them to life. Director Gil Junger has a ton of experience if not almost entirely from Television but in this case this isn't a bad thing whatsoever. He obviously has a great grasp on humour and knows how to tell a story. The cast works so well together and Junger should be given credit for putting them together. The writing team of Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah Lutz have gone on to write some incredibly fun scripts including Legally Blonde, The House Bunny, and She's The Man to name three of my favourite. They're stories are simply fun and hugely entertaining but I'm not sure they've done anything that meets the level of this absolute classic.

This has to be one of the tightest scripts ever written; so tight that the ending is too abrupt. That would be a problem if not for the way director Robert Altman paces the film so nicely that we don't have time to react to what is being shown on screen before something else sinister and important occurs.All across the board, the acting is quite terrific with Brit Kenneth Branagh giving a strong performance as Georgia attorney Rick Macgruder, who falls for mysterious woman Mallory Doss (Embeth Davidtz), and ends up mired in her dark and convoluted family involving her ex-husband (Tom Berenger) and crazed father (Robert Duvall). All this combined with Rick's divorce and attempt to father his two children leads to conventional endings but I still was utterly involved and entertained by all that happened in this movie.At it's highest level, The Gingerbread Man can work only as a stylish law drama and it does exactly that very well. Branagh and Davidtz are very good together and Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant as a womanizing, alcoholic private eye who has little to do but does it very well. This is the most un-Altman of all of his films yet he makes it work with his constant moving camera and zooms and by sticking to the script and keeping the character's quirks and idiosyncrasies to a minimum, I have to admit I really enjoyed this movie even though I know deep down that it is only a mildly entertaining film with nothing else to it. Still, sometimes it's a good reminder to know why movies are so popular after all these years.

I am also not the best critic, so I don't usually give things low ratings unless they really were bad. But I don't believe that Attack of the Clones was that terrible. Allow me to explain.I loved the original series. I think those movies were great. The Characters were amazing! The movies were action-packed and dramatic, yet hilarious too, and the action and comic moments didn't interfere! The Models looked so real, if you told me when I first saw it when I was 6 that they were CGI, I would have believed you! Everyone did their best. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Darth Vader, etc. They were all so great!Now the new series is not nearly as good as the old series, but I believe that the prequel trilogy is SERIOUSLY underrated. They aren't as good as the old movies, but they are still amazing movies! It shows a new side of things. It brings something new to the plate. It shows how Anakin was able to turn from an innocent boy to the menacing Darth Vader. It showed how Palpatine set up the trap that destroyed the Republic and created the Empire. It dug deeper into what it meant to be a Jedi, and how we can be easily led astray if we let our guard down. It gives us 2 paths. The Path of Luke, and the Path of Anakin.Now that I have done some explaining, it's time to do what I wrote this review for. To review Attack of the Clones. I do agree it did have many flaws. I do agree that there was a lot of CGI in this movie. However, I do not think it was just to advertise its special effects. If you want a movie that does just that, go see 2012 or At World's End. This was one of the weaker movies, but it was still amazing.If you look closely, you see a lot of parallelism in the trilogies. Phantom Menace and A New Hope both introduced to us the characters. A major character has a major loss (Obi- Wan\/Luke). The main character destroys the ship that is causing all the trouble (Anakin\/Luke). The main character comes from humble origins (Anakin\/Luke). The same thing happened in Revenge of the Sith and Return of the Jedi (my 2 favorites of the series). Except there are some opposites. Anakin and Luke choose different paths. But they each fight someone close to them (Obi-Wan the mentor\/Darth Vader the father). Palpatine has set his plan in order. But the results are different (Destruction of the Republic\/Destruction of the Empire). In one we see great sadness (Padme's funeral and Creation of Darth Vader) and in the other we see great joy (Celebrations throughout the galaxy). We also see parallelism in Attack of the Clones and Empire Strikes Back. We see the characters evolve from what they were in the first movie into what they will be in the third.In Attack of the Clones, we see many things. We see how Anakin struggles with the loss of his mother (Luke struggled for his friends who were in danger). We see how Palpatine sets up the plan that will slowly destroy the Republic. We see what started the Clone Wars, which Palpatine used to his advantage. We see the Jedi Order starting to crumble. It wasn't the best Star Wars, but it was still Star Wars.People criticize its flaws. They say that Anakin acts like a selfish brat. That is exactly what a young Darth Vader would be like! Anakin's anger got the best of him, and consumed him. We see that he has always struggled between good and evil (just as Luke did, on the Second Death Star). They say that there was too many special effects. I feel like the special effects didn't detract from the story. It's not like they animated all those battle scenes for no reason. They needed to show the intensity of the fight. The plot was a little confusing at first, and I feel it could've been better, but it was still better than other major series installments (such as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull).All in all, it wasn't as strong as the other Star Wars movies, but it was still Star Wars, and I thought it was amazing! 9\/10, because it had some flaws.

In one we see great sadness (Padme's funeral and Creation of Darth Vader) and in the other we see great joy (Celebrations throughout the galaxy). We also see parallelism in Attack of the Clones and Empire Strikes Back. We see the characters evolve from what they were in the first movie into what they will be in the third.In Attack of the Clones, we see many things. We see how Anakin struggles with the loss of his mother (Luke struggled for his friends who were in danger). We see how Palpatine sets up the plan that will slowly destroy the Republic. We see what started the Clone Wars, which Palpatine used to his advantage. We see the Jedi Order starting to crumble. It wasn't the best Star Wars, but it was still Star Wars.People criticize its flaws. They say that Anakin acts like a selfish brat. That is exactly what a young Darth Vader would be like! Anakin's anger got the best of him, and consumed him. We see that he has always struggled between good and evil (just as Luke did, on the Second Death Star). They say that there was too many special effects. I feel like the special effects didn't detract from the story. It's not like they animated all those battle scenes for no reason. They needed to show the intensity of the fight. The plot was a little confusing at first, and I feel it could've been better, but it was still better than other major series installments (such as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull).All in all, it wasn't as strong as the other Star Wars movies, but it was still Star Wars, and I thought it was amazing! 9\/10, because it had some flaws.

The main character is a rapist who lives in London England. He is in charge of a gang. He treats everybody in the gang like crap. So about 20 minutes into the movie the gang smashes milk mixed with some kind of drug (can't remember what it was, also he had just gone in to kill a woman at a house) into his face which makes him lose his vision for a while. The police pick him up and take him to jail. He is put in prison. Then while he is in prison he hears of an experiment that will make bad people good. So he participates in it. The experiment involves him watching violent images on a movie theater screen while it plays Beetoban (can't remember how you spell it) with his eyes winged open with well I forget how they made his eyes stay open. It drives him crazy. But after that he gets to go home. Some guy says something he doesn't like while he is there and he tries to beat him up but then he falls over when he tries to do it. Later his parents kick him out of their house and he ends up running elsewhere. He runs into the guys from the gang he used to lead. They're cops now. They beat him up. He ends up at a house of man who's daughter was raped and killed by him and his gang. The man doesn't recognize him at first but later he does recognize him and tries to kill him. He ends up in the hospital where the government guys who sent him to the experiment come back and release him. But then at the very end he goes back to being a rapist! That's what I hate about the movie! My cousin likes this and said, I liked it because it's about how you can change the way someone thinks but you can't change who they are. I hated the ending. He should've been good at the end but he goes back to being a rapist! And that is why I give this a 1. He should've just gone away from crime and led an ordinary life but he didn't. I've actually heard it's the opposite in the book where he does give up being a rapist. Anyway that is just what I think. Although this cousin who liked it is the only person in my family that likes it.
