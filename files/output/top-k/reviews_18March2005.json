When the scene is followed by the simple opening title Happiness written in pretty cursive writing, you know it's going to be ironic as well. Happiness was written and directed by Todd Solondz, the mind behind the film Welcome to the Dollhouse, a film that was fantastic but really hard to watch if the viewer has any kind of heart. Happiness follows in the same vein, though this time, instead of centering around one character, Solondz puts a New Jersey family at the center of the film and develops new characters through their relationship with the family.Overseeing the family is Mona Jordan (Lasser), the matriarch of the family who has just been told by her husband that he no longer loves her. Lenny Jordan (Gazzara) is simply sick of being tied to someone continuously, while insisting that there is no one else. Joy Jordan (Adams) is a serially employed thirty-something single female who is constantly belittled by her family and ignored by society. She is most close to her sister Trish Maplewood (Stevenson), a stay at home mother with three kids who likes to say she has it all. Her husband Bill (Baker) is a psychiatrist who outwardly appears to be a stoic family man, but is actually a pedophile who, within five minutes of the introduction of his character, goes to a convenience store to pick up a teen heartthrob magazine so he can masturbate in the back seat of his car to the pictures of the young boys on the cover. The third sister in the family is Helen Jordan (Boyle), an author recently made semi-famous for an angst-ridden published diary (filled with lies) who has a very high opinion of herself and a way of making others feel badly about themselves while never raising her smooth-as-glass voice or making her jabs obvious. Her neighbor Allen (Hoffman) is in love with her, only he is so inept at socialization and unable to approach her that he attempts to satisfy his desires by first making random obscene phone calls to various women, and then making Helen a target herself. Another neighbor, Kristina (Manheim) is an insecure, quiet woman who is constantly trying to befriend Allen, possibly as a love interest.There is quite a cast of characters to this ensemble picture, and the story lines become intricate and increasingly more complicated as the film progresses. Happiness is filled with excellent character actors (at the top of the list would certainly be Hoffman) but the most compelling character and character portrayal would be Baker's character of Bill Maplewood. Obviously, a film that deals unflinchingly with pedophilia and child rape, particularly under the guise of a dark comedy is going to be held under closer observation, but even under this scrutiny, Baker's portrayal is absolutely flawless. While his character is a monster, Baker is able to provide a human side to it, where I was left thinking he was a terrible man, but also had sympathy for him because he had a sickness. There are not many actors I can think of that could pull off this role as stupendously as Baker did. Baker was the clear star of the film in my opinion, but the performances of every person in the cast were fantastic as well, particularly the young boy who played Baker's oldest son.As I stated earlier, Happiness is rife with irony because on the surface, everyone is miserable. However, it soon becomes relatively clear that this is just how these people are, and each of them to some extent ARE living in happiness, as misguided as it may appear to be. Everyone ends up being hurt or disappointed on some level, but they are still together and seem to be satisfied to be in the destructively emotional rut they are in. Solondz, who really has his finger on the pulse of misery, (Just like when, upon hearing that Stephen King gets inspiration for his books from his dreams I was glad that he at least makes millions from being terrified at night, I would hate to get a front row seat in Solondz's psyche) really gives the audience something to chew with Happiness. I loved the chances he took with the subject matter, I loved the performances, and I loved the film as a whole because it was just so damn well done. It's not an easy film to watch, and it's not an entirely pleasant one to watch at times, but it is truly a piece of genius with the way it is intricately put together; envision trying to glue tiny shards of crystal into place with a tweezers &#150; the characters in Happiness are as fragile and ready to shatter at any moment, whether they can see it for themselves or not. 8\/10 --Shelly ","genre":null},{"date":"18 March 2005","score":"41 out of 51 people found the following review useful","review":" When a film opens with a scene between two people, one breaking up with the other, culminating in the dumped calling the dumper Shit, you know you're in for something dark with this film.

Unfortunately, Michael Myers learns where she is, and heads for the hospital himself.Rosenthal uses the hospital setting to great advantage. With only a skeleton crew working, the hospital is dark and empty. In several scenes, Rosenthal uses the darkness of the hospital to mask Michael's presence in a room only to have him appear as the light shifts, a truly chilling effect. Rosenthal originally wanted to go with more of the implied violence like Carpenter had used in the original, but he ended up shooting some very gory death scenes to help the film compete with some of its competition in the booming slasher film field of the early 80's so this is a very GORY film.Overall this is a really enjoyable movie but film purists will be put off by it and should stick with the original.

Basically young FBI trainee agent Clarice Starling (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Jodie Foster) is assigned to help find a missing woman, the daughter of the senator, from a psychotic serial killer who skins his victims, to make some sort of woman-like suit\/costume, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). The only person who can help lead her towards him is getting an insight into his twisted mind by talking to another psychopath, once respected psychiatrist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, aka Hannibal the Cannibal (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Sir Anthony Hopkins). FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scot Glenn) believes that Lecter, just as powerful and intelligently manipulative, has all the answers to their questions to help locate Bill, but they still need his real name to get where-abouts. Clarice, haunted by memories of her father's death and lambs on her old farm home (the meaning of the title), which Hannibal picks on and forces her to tell to get the answers she wants, needs to gain his confidence before he is going to give any information. As Clarice gets closer to finding Bill, finding a moth cocoon in one victim's throat, Hannibal managed (somehow, when he was strapped into his harnesses) to steal a pen, and take off the metal bit on the outside, and make his escape from the manor house he was transported to. I don't know what was worse, the fact the he ate on the guards faces and killed both of them, or the fact that he put a dead guy's face onto his as disguise for his escape in an ambulance. In the end, Clarice finds Buffalo Bill, or Jame Gumb's home, and recognises it from the moth that comes in, and in defence she kills him in the dark room, and obviously in the end is rewarded with real FBI status. But she wasn't expecting a phone call from Hannibal, so it is a really good double ending; half good, half bad, but mostly bad. Also starring Anthony Heald as Dr. Frederick Chilton, Kasi Lemmons as Ardelia Mapp, Lawrence T. Wrentz as Agent Burroughs, Frankie Faison as Barney Matthews, Masha Skorobogatov as Young Clarice, Jeffrie Lane as Clarice's Father, Diane Baker as Sen. Ruth Martin, Brooke Smith as Catherine Martin and Charles Napier as Lt. Boyle. Foster and Hopkins both deserved their Oscars, the violence is pretty hard-hitting in a few scenes, there is also a moment with spunk going into Clarice's hair (very sick) and the highlights are all with Hopkins, the obvious being his first encounter with Foster, his escape, and the final phone call, a great film. It won the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Film Score for Howard Shore, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Jodie Foster was number 23, and Sir Anthony Hopkins number 7 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 3 on The World's Greatest Actor, Clarice Starling was number 6 (Hero) and Hannibal Lecter was number 1 (Villain) on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, it was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (A census taker once tried to test me.
