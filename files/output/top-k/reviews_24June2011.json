[{"date":"24 June 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Rarely do foreign films receive the notoriety of Run Lola Run and turn out to be funny and entertaining rather than dramatic and difficult. Tom Tykwer's film works for all audiences in part because it sets up a simple premise Lola must help her boyfriend Manni come up with 100,000 Deutsch marks in 20 minutes or his employer will kill him. With our eyes not transfixed on subtitles, Run Lola Run works in some crazy visual aesthetics and suddenly, Tykwer's breaking all the rules much to our delight.Run Lola Run doesn't quite start out that way a scene out of a Fellini movie with wandering people and a narrator posing existential questions doesn't exactly set the tone for the thriller (mostly) that will follow, but when combined with the other radical visual choices, when the story does violate expectations (and reality), the audiences is already on board. Tykwer invites his audience to jump the ship of convention and we couldn't line up any faster.In truth, Tykwer's film is an existential love story slathered in bright and fun distractions. There's a definite contradiction between the ideas he wants to convey and the film's breakneck pacing. Interestingly, the high-speed plot actually enhances the effectiveness of the occasional slow and dialogue-heavy scenes and draws our attention to them. Two scenes in particular are single takes of Lola (Franka Potente) and Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) lying in bed questioning each other's love. They're completely different in tone than the adrenaline-filled scenes of Lola trying to get to Manni with money in time before he holds up a grocery store, but in a strange way they color the characters with surprising depth and humanity.If you can avoid getting caught up in the extensive coincidences and video game-like plot and can focus on more traditional aspects of the film such as character motivation, Run Lola Run starts to reveal itself. We barely get to know Lola before she takes off down the streets of Berlin in hopes that she can come up with a ridiculous amount of money within the course of 20 minutes. Clearly she can't imagine life without Manni and is willing to risk it all as she does in the film's three trials. Contrast that pure devotion to the scenes where Lola and Manni can't seem to communicate their love and that says it all about true love.Tykwer simply relishes the chance to make his film blow our minds. Every single moment of the run that he constructs has been carefully thought out like any good thriller, only he sends the story into radically unexpected directions. Despite a repeating pattern, you never know what's going to come next and the occasional atypical camera movement or surrealist choice &#x97; or Lola's superpower that allows her to shriek and shatter glass &#x97; amplifies that intensity.Although on the whole the film aims for satisfaction over complete understanding or true closure with the purpose for Tykwer's madness, the effectiveness of the whole experience is unparalleled by most films that break from convention.~Steven CVisit my site at http\/\/moviemusereviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"24 June 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Rarely do foreign films receive the notoriety of Run Lola Run and turn out to be funny and entertaining rather than dramatic and difficult.

Although not the first time that stop-motion photography had been used in cinema history (I think that award goes to a long forgotten, and rarely seen, series of animations about Gertie the Dinosaur), this was certainly the first time that such a technique featured in a major feature film. This film is now doing the rounds of the West of England with a new score composed by JJ Garden of The Scissor Sisters, and I caught a showing of it at my local cinema, The Curzon in Clevedon, tonight.The film has undoubtedly dated, and has a plot line through which a full sized T-Rex could be driven (although this has more to do with the fact that the film has been so chopped and messed about with over the years that it, I would imagine, bares little resemblance to the original released version all those years back). There are character that seem to appear from nowhere - including what appears to be a blacked-up native in the Brazilian section (not the apeman, although he\/it seems an odd addition to the film!), and some of the acting - most notably Bessie Love - definitely belongs to another era. Having said all that the effects still impress at times, and the influence this film had on all subsequent monster films, from the aforementioned King Kong through the monster films of the 1950s right up and beyond Jurassic Park etc can be seen in every jagged movement the dinosaurs make! At one point a dinosaur sticks his tongue out and my thoughts immediately went to the Alien series of films - I would doubt that any film before or since has such a lasting influence on the history of cinema.One point on the music. JJ Garden has composed a score consisting of electronic keyboard effects etc, which sounds amazing inside the auditorium, and occasionally illuminates the film to a degree, but personally I found it rather grating after a while and I wished for a little more variety and humour. Still, a small price to pay to be able to see such an important piece of cinema history in the way it was meant to be seen, on a big screen with a large crowd etc!
