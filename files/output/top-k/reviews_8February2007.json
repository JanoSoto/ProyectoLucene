[{"date":"8 February 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Jim Carrey's (Ace Ventura) performance as this quirky insane comedian in this biographical comedy about a stressed comedian trying to make it in the world failed to capture my interest. Carrey has always been my favourite comedian with his physical enthusiastic style of humour and although he shines in this film once again, I failed to be inspired by the plot. The beginning was sensational. A black and white shot of Carrey standing addressing the audience with the credits running infront of him, this is simply a must watch! The humour behind Carrey's impressions are cannot be missed it is that captivating and humorous.However from the beginning the film did somewhat drag with many lapses of concentration from the central idea. Too many characters are introduced and focused upon rather than the idea and struggle behind Kauffman's life. I understand that this film is based on a true story but unfortunately the plot behind this film is far from stimulating. Carrey's performance makes the film enjoyable however. There are many great scenes with him in, for example the beginning and the ending provides an interesting twist to the film. I found myself drifting off at points if I'm being honest. A somewhat humorous comedy with magnificence from Carrey once again. Not his best performance in the average comedy drama. Watch it if&#133;you are a fan of Jim Carrey ","genre":null},{"date":"8 February 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Jim Carrey's (Ace Ventura) performance as this quirky insane comedian in this biographical comedy about a stressed comedian trying to make it in the world failed to capture my interest.
