And I do mean only moments !I have always thought that Scream 1 was a horror spoof masquerading as horror. Because in its core it's nothing but a remake of many famous horror themes. However, it worked, since it was really well-made thrilling and scary slasher. After doing another one, as if writer \/ director Craven had no ideas for a third. So, why not assuring the matter of spoofing, yet with spoofing his own spoof? Yes, let's spoof Scream 1 and 2 in 3, while uncovering some of the cinema's facts, of playing with real facts (like showing a rubber knife, confessing about acting as a 20 year old girl while being 35..etc). That would provide a new atmosphere to work with (the backgrounds of making a movie), and freeing some of Craven's testimonies towards cinema; of which could be funny for him personally, and interesting for a cinema lover who saw in Scream 1 and 2 a cultured horror. Craven somehow did it before in New Nightmare (1994), one of A Nightmare on Elm Street's sequels, however without the sarcasm out of the movies. And so he made 2 semi-brilliant scenes concerning this interesting point. One with (Jenny McCarthy) before she got killed. And another one with a (Carrie Fisher) cameo. Other than that, he didn't tire himself doing a good horror along the way. Because the rest was another cheap and uninspired slasher, NOTHING MORE !The plot of who the killer was, the events, the acting along with the directing.. well, don't search for anything smart or entertaining. It seems poor and a bit repetitive with nothing new. Look for instance at the script while reusing old stuff like Neve's mother and Jamie Kenndey (a video for himself which he left before getting killed?? Give me a break !!). It's clear that, away from the aforementioned couple of scenes, Craven as a writer \/ director was uninterested.To add more fuel, when a movie makes its mystery's end impossible to guess for the viewers, then this is silly and refused. We feel cheated, and our intelligence gets insulted thereby. This is what happens here, especially with that lame ending, which pushes you to ask Who are those killers anyway??. A very bad Agatha Christie effect I believe !Unlike its precedents, this Scream ends up unthrilling and unscary. And since the line of spoofing itself wasn't really meaty, I have to say that Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds' (Red right hand), the song of the closing credits, was the only completely amusing thing around. So eventually, this movie has couple of good scenes, nice song, with (rather drowned in) idiot slasher plot !(Scream 3) is like elegant man you meet; who throws 2 or 3 good lines, then blabber about nothing for 2 hours.

Most of them turn him down rudely EXCEPT for Dorothy. They get caught making out by some bullies and those bullies humiliate him in front of the whole school. Fast forward thirteen years - the girls are all grown up and are (for the most part) successful women. Pretty soon they, and others, start getting picked off by a mysterious serial killer who stalks them wearing a cupid mask. Could that boy they bullied and make fun of be the killer all grown up, or is the culprit someone new? Perhaps one of the girls' boyfriends?I really enjoyed 'Valentine' when I first saw it years ago. Is it a pretty sophisticated horror film. It's got a beautiful cast, gorgeous location shot, clearly a decent sized budget.. and it's actually scary! There is something unsettling about the killers' mask. It's a cupid mask, but from afar it sort of resembles Michael Myers' mask from the Halloween films. It was really creepy and some of the stalking scenes were just as creepy. The killer goes after his victims in a college campus, a small apartment, a mansion - all the location spots work in this movie. Lots of tense moments when he appears. There isn't a ton of blood, so the gore-hounds might be disappointed. I thought it was a decent amount. It didn't add or take away from the story.Some very good acting in this as well, especially by Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw and Denise Richards. I loved Jessica Cauffiel in this as the quirky Lily, but her role was sort of small and she was underused much like Katherine Heigl. I thought Valentine (for the year it was made in) was a cut above most slasher\/horror flicks. It isn't just some silly average horror movie, it's got class and a certain kind of edge that separates it from others made around this time.

I mean this film's got stars Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, and director Alfred Hitchcock behind it. Given that I have reasonably high expectations based on their work, I wanted to get into this film for the sake of those people involved. Unfortunately, such talented people as these can't save a disappointingly dull film such as Spellbound. In the film, we follow a psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) at a mental hospital who is considered by her fellow doctors as one of the best. She and her fellow peers welcome the new director (Gregory Peck) of the hospital, but fairly soon, she begins to notice some peculiar aspects about him. She notices that he has a unusual fear of seeing dark parallel lines and a white background together. In addition, she eventually finds out that he isn't who he claims to be and that he has a serious case of amnesia. When she also learns that he accidentally committed a murder, she tries to cure him of his mental struggles by learning more about his past. I should mention the few aspects of this picture that I found were decent. One thing is that there are a few eye-catching shots that I thought were well executed. There's a shot in which is similar to the type of camera shots you see in today's first person shooter video games, where someone is pointing a gun at one of the main leads and we see through their point of view. I thought that shot and similar shots like that were worthy of praising. I also don't find the performances from the leads that bad and I thought they were doing whatever they could to keep the film moving. So what did I think made Spellbound as disappointing as I'm claiming it to be? Well, my problem with Spellbound can be summarized as such it's boring beyond belief. Why do I find it boring? I thought the direction seemed to indicate that everything that was happening in the plot was not the slightest bit interesting. The screenplay by Ben Hecht didn't give its characters anything fascinating to talk about and hardly did anything to get us invested in following the plot. This film is basically trying to force us to avoid emotionally attaching to it as much as possible. What's worse is that it succeeds well at doing just that. About 10 to 20 minutes into watching this film, that's the point where I completely lost interest in following the narrative since it is told in such a lifeless manner between the boring conversations the characters have and the boring things that are being captured on film. I believe this is definitely one of Alfred Hitchcock's weakest films because of its lack of emotional involvement, because of its uninspiring direction, because of its lame script, and because of the fact that the story that was being told wasn't that good to begin with. Maybe I didn't pick up on something in the main plot, maybe I followed it just fine enough, either way I expected much more from the talents involved that what I got. Unless you're a hardcore Hitchcock fan and just want to look at it for the sake of seeing all his flicks, I'd definitely say there are much better Hitchcock films to check out.

Those are the reasons Evil Dead II is one of my favorite Horror films,one of my favorite sequels and one of my favorite movies of all time and why Evil Dead II is a true Horror classic.Taking place right after the events in the first Evil Dead,our hero Ash(Bruce Campbell) is still at the cabin in the woods still trying to fight off the flesh possessing ghouls. Now with a group of strangers also in the cabin,Ash and the group must stay in the cabin and trying to fight and survive The Evil Dead or the demons will swallow their souls.Evil Dead IIDead By Dawn is such an amazing and brilliant Horror film because while it still has the scary feel of the first film,ED II takes on a different direction by adding Comedy into the mix and gives viewers one of the most insane,crazy and over the top Horror films of all time. Mixing Horror and Comedy together is never easy,but director Sam Raimi manages to pull it off so flawlessly. Raimi fills up the film with funny and imaginative slapstick and mixing it with over the top gore,making us laugh and squirm at the same time. Raimi is obviously a huge fan of The Three Stooges(even calling the stunt men fake Shemps)and Raimi applies that same slapstick Comedy and hilarious suffering with this film,especially with the character Ash. The character Ash goes through such maniacal and hilarious torture from either the demons or himself that you'll wonder if he'll make it out alive or lose his mind and that's one of the great things about the film. Horror and Comedy are two sides of the same coin and Raimi knows this because Raimi balances out both Horror and Comedy by taking the most horrifying situations and making them funny and also taking the funny situations and making them horrible and it's done in a smart way. EDII is one of the few films that can wonderfully and greatly mixes hilarious Comedy and over the top gore and the only films that can match it are other Horror Comedy classics such as The Return Of The Living Dead,An American Werewolf In London,Re-Animator and Dead Alive just to name a few. EDII and those other great Horror films are apart of the great Horror sub genre called Splatstick(a mixture and combination of Comedy and gore). Even though there is a lot hilarious Comedy,Raimi still knows that EDII is at heart a Horror film and Raimi gives viewers a lot scary,intense and suspenseful moments,using the demon POV shots with great effect and crazy insane energy using loud sound effects and dark atmosphere and Raimi lets his imagination run wild. This movie is like the first Evil Dead on a bad acid trip and you're coming along for a crazy ride. The movie's violence and gory scenes,while toned down from the first film(most of the blood and gore is red,green and blue)is still great and intense and matches the violence of the first film. The main character Ash is a lot different from the first film,where in the first one he was scared and heroic but in this film he's tough and heroic and willing to face the demons head-on and spitting out great one-liners,even though he still shows fear and terror. Ash is one of my all-time favorite movie characters cause of this film. The ending is great cliffhanger ending and is a good set-up for the follow-up Army Of Darkness and will have viewers laughing. There's been debate over the years about whether or not EDII is a sequel or a remake of the first film. While a few scenes are a remake of the first film,the whole film is a sequel and has it's own creativity and originality like the first film and is a classic like the first one.The cast does a good job. Bruce Campbel gives a brilliant,hilarious performance as Ash,saying great one-liners,being tough,funny,taking out the demons with an iron fist. This performance made Ash a classic character of the Horror genre and made Bruce Campbell a B-movie icon,a Horror icon and a Genre movie icon. An excellent performance. Sarah Berry does a good job as Annie. Dan Hicks and Kassie Wesley give funny performances as rednecks Jake and Bobby Joe. Theodore Raimi(Sam's Brother)is funny and freaky as Possessed Henrietta. Richard Domeier does a good job as Ed,Annie's boyfriend. Denise Bixler(Linda),John Peakes(Professor Raymond Knowby)and Lou Hancock(Henrietta Knowby)give good performances as well.The direction by Sam Raimi is excellent,with Raimi bringing manic,crazy energy to the film with great angles,close-ups and the POV shots of the demons and Raimi also does well in the scary and funny scenes. Great direction,Raimi.The music score by Joseph Doluca is impressive and memorable and fits in with the insane,crazy energy of the film. Great score.The special effects by K.N.B FX group are excellent,well-done,gory and at times very realistic and work for the film.In final word,if you love Horror films,Cult films,Sam Raimi or Bruce Campbell,I suggest you see Evil Dead IIDead By Dawn,a Horror classic that will stand the test of time and stay with you forever.

Cain novel as anything but a disappointment. In the film, Jack Nicholson plays drifter Frank Chambers who enters the lives of Cora (Jessica Lange) and her much older husband Nick (John Colicos). Soon the drifter and Cora start up a sexual relationship, which leads to them planning the murder of the husband. This here would be the fourth version of the classic story and the second one filmed in America. Unlike the previous versions, director Bob Rafelson didn't have to worry about censors but even so this version isn't nearly as hot as the earlier one with Lana Turner. Outside a rather intense sex scene towards the start of the picture, this thing really never takes off, which is too bad because they've got a terrific cast and some beautiful settings but in the end the film is just flat. I think the first forty- five minutes are the best thing in the film as we see the love triangle set up and there's no question that the director has the look of the era down perfectly. I thought the setting really added a lot of atmosphere but sadly very little else happens. Nicholson was the perfect choice to play a drifter but the screenplay really doesn't give him too much to work with. Lange is clearly the best thing in the movie as she delivers a sexual charge to the thing. Colicos is also extremely good as the husband in a strong supporting performance. What really hurts the film is the second half because the director never really makes us believe or feel anything for the two leads. Are we supposed to hate them for what they've done? Are we supposed to be rooting for them to get away with the murder and live happily ever after? The entire second half of the film features way too many dialogue scenes that lead no where and in the end the romance that starts to bloom towards the end just never fully works. The film isn't nearly as bad as its reputation but at the same time there's no question that it's a major disappointment and a bitter feeling takes over when you think about what could have been.

Didn't see it in the cinema (did anyone?) but I watched it several times when it hit HBO. It quickly became my favorite movie. Peter O'Toole turns in one of his best performances as Eli Cross, the overbearing, manipulative director of a WWI film. Steve Railsback (known mostly for his portrayal of Charles Manson in Helter Skelter) is a fugitive named Cameron who wanders onto Cross's film set while fleeing the police. He gets involved a stunt where a car drives off a bridge and the stuntman disappears. Having seen Cameron's skill and inventiveness in his flight from the police, Cross decides to bring him onto the film set by pretending that he is Burt, the missing stuntman. Barbara Hershey plays Nina Franklin, the leading lady of the film- within-the-film, and quickly she becomes Cameron's love interest. The main part of the film involves the mind games Cross plays with the young couple, and a good deal of stunt work by Cameron running across the various roofs of the Coronado hotel in San Diego. As the film heads towards its climax, Cameron starts to wonder why Cross keeps making him do increasingly dangerous stunts, and wonders if he'll get off the set alive. The film concerns itself with themes of paranoia and trust. Along the way, O'Toole owns every scene he's in. Barbara Hershey does a fine job as Nina. As for Railsback...well, he's not quite up to the O'Toole standard. He exudes manic energy in every scene he's in, but it ends up lacking in subtlety. The cinematography and screenplay have a lot of what now seem like 70s- era filmmaking tricks. One key scene features Railsback speaking while we see Hershey's reflection in a car window. At one point this may have seemed inventive, but from the current perspective it's comically outdated. Still, in spite of its flaws I love this film for its ambition and, above all, for O'Toole.

I had no idea what was funny. Now I don't know how I ever thought that.Hollywood Ending is a 2002 film from the prolific Allen, and he gives it to Hollywood but good. He plays a neurotic, hypochondriacal film director named Val who can't get arrested thanks to being so difficult. But in a conference about a film, The City that Never Sleeps, his ex-wife Ellie (Tea Leoni), in charge of development, is positive that he would be the best man for the job.

","genre":"Biography, Drama"},{"date":"15 February 2013","score":"","review":" As a boy, one of my favourite books was Pat Reid's The Colditz Story (my father owned a copy). Reid's classic wartime memoir tells the story of how he, and the other Allied prisoners of war held in Colditz, attempted to outwit their German captors and escape from captivity. I was enthralled not only by the courage of these men but also by their resourcefulness in plotting their escape attempts and in manufacturing or procuring all those items they would need- food, civilian clothing, forged papers, German money, etc. Resourceful though the men of Colditz were, they only ever attempted to break out of the camp in small groups of, at most, three or four. Paul Brickhill's The Great Escape tells the story of an even more audacious deed, the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in March 1944. War films were a staple of the cinema, both in America and Britain, during the fifties and sixties, and films about life in POW camps were a popular sub-genre; other examples include The Colditz Story, The Wooden Horse (also based on an escape from Stalag Luft III) and Danger Within in which the villains are, unusually, Italian rather than German. Such films, at least those set in Europe, generally have a fairly light-hearted, patriotic tone, and usually end with the prisoners putting one over on the nasty Nazis by pulling off a daring escape. (POW films set in the Far East, such as Bridge on the River Kwai or King Rat, are often darker in tone). This film tells a fictionalised version of the Stalag Luft III breakout. Names are changed, but some of the characters are based on real men; Richard Attenborough's character, for example, referred to as Roger Bartlett, is based on the real-life Roger Bushell. The greatest change made is perhaps the introduction of a number of American characters; in real life no Americans participated in the escape- they had all been moved to a separate camp- but here no fewer than four big Hollywood stars- Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson and James Coburn- were brought in. This was doubtless done for commercial reasons; unlike The Colditz Story or The Wooden Horse the film was made by an American company, and the days were long gone when American audiences would flock to see a film without any home-grown stars. Even the trick of casting American actors as Canadians to disguise their accents, as was done with Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen or Gregory Peck in The Purple Plain, was starting to wear a bit thin by the sixties. Some critics tend to get very hot under the collar about what they see as Hollywood's attempts to claim the credit for the British war-effort, but I feel that in this case the distortion was justified. World War II was, after all, a joint enterprise, and the introduction of American stars highlights this theme of Allied co-operation against a common enemy. Moreover, had the film been made with an all-British cast we would have been deprived of one of McQueen's greatest performances as Captain Virgil Hilts, known as The Cooler King because of the amount of time he spends in the cooler, or punishment cells. (This would later be inverted to produce McQueen's own nickname, The King of Cool). McQueen also provides the film's most iconic moment, namely his attempt to escape to Switzerland on a stolen motor-bike. There are too many other good contributions from the ensemble case to single them all out, but I should mention Attenborough as Bartlett, the organiser of the escape, and Donald Pleasence (himself a former POW) as Colin Blythe, the skilled forger whose intricate work by candlelight damages his eyesight.The first half of the film has a similar light-hearted tone to POW films like The Colditz Story, as the prisoners set about the task of constructing their three escape tunnels and putting together their stocks of escape equipment under the noses of their captors. And then, about halfway through, the tone starts to darken. One of the tunnels is discovered by the Germans and a prisoner is shot dead during a breakout attempt. Undaunted, the prisoners press ahead with the planned Great Escape. The original idea is for some 250 prisoners to break out of the camp through one of the remaining tunnels, and although the plan has to be aborted when the guards spot one prisoner leaving the tunnel, 76 men succeed in getting clear of the camp. The film then traces the progress of some of these men as they try to make their way to freedom across German-occupied Europe.We know, of course, that only a handful of the Great Escapers succeeded in making their way to neutral countries; the great majority of them were recaptured and many of them were shot on Hitler's express orders. The film does not shy away from recounting these tragic events, which makes it something of an exception to the normal conventions of the prisoner-of-war film. Yet this does not make it depressing. Despite its tragic ending, the film, which ends with the caption This picture is dedicated to the fifty,- a reference to the number of recaptured prisoners murdered by the Nazis- comes across as an inspiring tribute to the men involved in the Great Escape, an impression strengthened by the jaunty, defiant march which forms the basis of the famous musical score. This is one of the classic prison camp films of all time- my favourite apart from Bridge on the River Kwai. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2013","score":"","review":" As a boy, one of my favourite books was Pat Reid's The Colditz Story (my father owned a copy).

Moreover, had the film been made with an all-British cast we would have been deprived of one of McQueen's greatest performances as Captain Virgil Hilts, known as The Cooler King because of the amount of time he spends in the cooler, or punishment cells. (This would later be inverted to produce McQueen's own nickname, The King of Cool). McQueen also provides the film's most iconic moment, namely his attempt to escape to Switzerland on a stolen motor-bike. There are too many other good contributions from the ensemble case to single them all out, but I should mention Attenborough as Bartlett, the organiser of the escape, and Donald Pleasence (himself a former POW) as Colin Blythe, the skilled forger whose intricate work by candlelight damages his eyesight.The first half of the film has a similar light-hearted tone to POW films like The Colditz Story, as the prisoners set about the task of constructing their three escape tunnels and putting together their stocks of escape equipment under the noses of their captors. And then, about halfway through, the tone starts to darken. One of the tunnels is discovered by the Germans and a prisoner is shot dead during a breakout attempt. Undaunted, the prisoners press ahead with the planned Great Escape. The original idea is for some 250 prisoners to break out of the camp through one of the remaining tunnels, and although the plan has to be aborted when the guards spot one prisoner leaving the tunnel, 76 men succeed in getting clear of the camp. The film then traces the progress of some of these men as they try to make their way to freedom across German-occupied Europe.We know, of course, that only a handful of the Great Escapers succeeded in making their way to neutral countries; the great majority of them were recaptured and many of them were shot on Hitler's express orders. The film does not shy away from recounting these tragic events, which makes it something of an exception to the normal conventions of the prisoner-of-war film. Yet this does not make it depressing. Despite its tragic ending, the film, which ends with the caption This picture is dedicated to the fifty,- a reference to the number of recaptured prisoners murdered by the Nazis- comes across as an inspiring tribute to the men involved in the Great Escape, an impression strengthened by the jaunty, defiant march which forms the basis of the famous musical score. This is one of the classic prison camp films of all time- my favourite apart from Bridge on the River Kwai. 9\/10 ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, History"},{"date":"15 February 2013","score":"","review":" As a boy, one of my favourite books was Pat Reid's The Colditz Story (my father owned a copy). Reid's classic wartime memoir tells the story of how he, and the other Allied prisoners of war held in Colditz, attempted to outwit their German captors and escape from captivity. I was enthralled not only by the courage of these men but also by their resourcefulness in plotting their escape attempts and in manufacturing or procuring all those items they would need- food, civilian clothing, forged papers, German money, etc. Resourceful though the men of Colditz were, they only ever attempted to break out of the camp in small groups of, at most, three or four. Paul Brickhill's The Great Escape tells the story of an even more audacious deed, the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in March 1944. War films were a staple of the cinema, both in America and Britain, during the fifties and sixties, and films about life in POW camps were a popular sub-genre; other examples include The Colditz Story, The Wooden Horse (also based on an escape from Stalag Luft III) and Danger Within in which the villains are, unusually, Italian rather than German. Such films, at least those set in Europe, generally have a fairly light-hearted, patriotic tone, and usually end with the prisoners putting one over on the nasty Nazis by pulling off a daring escape. (POW films set in the Far East, such as Bridge on the River Kwai or King Rat, are often darker in tone). This film tells a fictionalised version of the Stalag Luft III breakout. Names are changed, but some of the characters are based on real men; Richard Attenborough's character, for example, referred to as Roger Bartlett, is based on the real-life Roger Bushell. The greatest change made is perhaps the introduction of a number of American characters; in real life no Americans participated in the escape- they had all been moved to a separate camp- but here no fewer than four big Hollywood stars- Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson and James Coburn- were brought in. This was doubtless done for commercial reasons; unlike The Colditz Story or The Wooden Horse the film was made by an American company, and the days were long gone when American audiences would flock to see a film without any home-grown stars. Even the trick of casting American actors as Canadians to disguise their accents, as was done with Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen or Gregory Peck in The Purple Plain, was starting to wear a bit thin by the sixties. Some critics tend to get very hot under the collar about what they see as Hollywood's attempts to claim the credit for the British war-effort, but I feel that in this case the distortion was justified.

One, it ushered in a whole new kind of animated film for children; dark, stylish, very adult, and usually appreciated by a certain type of child. This isn't necessarily the story believe would possess mainstream appeal by a public treated to the wonders of Toy Story and a previous slew of Disney films. Two, it bears a darker and more stark animation style that breaks free from the cuteness of other animated tales. And three, the explicit controversy that lead to this film's creation.For the Cliff Notes version of the story, Jeffrey Katzenberg, an executive at Disney, departed the day Pixar\/Disney head John Lasseter pitched the idea for A Bug's Life, a charming little computer animated feature centering around the rodents of your backyard. Not long after Katzenberg departed, he formed Dreamworks and his debut feature would be Antz, focusing, likewise, on an insect-drive society, released seven weeks before A Bug's Life. Lasseter was greatly disheartened by Katzenberg's move, which was easily the case of taking someone's great idea and using it against them. Which one became more well-known? At the time, I'd most likely say A Bug's Life, but both films have gone on to be sort of the forgotten creatures of two massive companies. Yet Antz is more than meets the eye in several regards.We focus on an ant colony in New York City where ant Z-4195 (voiced by Woody Allen - whose character is also nicknamed Z) is gridlocked in an oppressively totalitarian society where individualism is discouraged and conformity is king. As neurotic and somewhat inept he is, he hungers for the opportunity to express himself in a land dominated by conformists obeying the order of the ruling class. Z befriends Princess Bala (Sharon Stone), the daughter of the ruling queen ant, who takes a liking to his quirkiness, but recognizes he is merely a worker ant and not a noble soldier ant. To impress her, Z sneaks into the soldier march and is quickly taken for a ride to defend his ant colony. Yet he overlooks the fact that General Mandible (Gene Hackman) is purposely shipping out the loyal troops to die so he can formulate his own society filled with goon-like ants that talk with incredible power. The whole thing escalates into an integration of not only the plot of rebellion and survival, but romance and possessing a non-conformist attitude.The voice acting will without a doubt turn off some people, but there are so many terrifically cast people in this film that sink into their roles fittingly. Woody Allen comfortably sinks into his role as a neurotic worker, Gene Hackman is brilliantly cast as the villain, Sharon Stone works as the princess, and Sylvester Stallone and Danny Glover exercise their roles to a pleasant extent.Visually, as stated before, this is one of the darkest animated films I've seen - one of the very few not to be dominated by eye-popping, candy-coated colors while being soaked in a nice innocence that's easy to swallow. The message is strong and versatile; don't settle for conformity, but branch out and do what you want to do. Go against convention, do noble acts, do something that doesn't put you in a line occupied by faceless others. Some people have said Antz is a communist fable and I whole-heatedly agree. It shows in detail a society of shameless totalitarianism and exploits how it robs people (or ants in this case) of their individualistic qualities and personal traits.Antz is primarily targeted towards the ten and up demographic, but I can see slightly younger kids appreciating this for its charming convention-breaking roots and its enigmatic presence it unleashes on its viewers. Dreamworks would later become known for implementing this kind of style, where it would ditch the younger crowd demographic in favor of the tweens and teens still cool enough to see animated films. Needless to say, with their immense success with the Shrek and Madagascar franchises, they've had quite the lucrative success. At the very least, this is a footnote in the world of animation, not just for its successful cast but for its darker themes and appearance that contrast it from the typical animated film.Voiced by Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Sylvester Stallone, Danny Glover, Jennifer Lopez, Christopher Walken, Anne Bancroft, and Dan Aykroyd.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"15 February 2013","score":"","review":" Maniac is a hard movie to like. It's ugly, brutal, grimy, slow paced and has scenes which make you feel really dirty. But it has the B-movie feel which helps a lot. The gritty realism given by director William Lustig(Maniac Cop) is effective. Tom Savini's gore is perfect and as realistic as it could get. But the star of the movie is Joe Spinell(RIP) who wrote this movie and played the hero, Frank.Frank is an amazingly damaged individual. He is a vicious, remorseless killer but apparently has the emotional maturity of a child. Joe Spinell must have gone into some really dark and disturbing area for researching this role because it's a fantastic performance. I daresay, it's Oscar worthy. But because of the low-budget nature of the film and the fact that there was too much gore, Spinell didn't even get a Golden Globe Nod. It's so uncomfortable to watch Frank's horrible apartment and his pathetic living that it's a welcome sight to see beautiful, sweet Caroline Munro. The film has a remarkable scene(apart from the exploding head scene) where a nurse is stalked in a subway station. It's a masterpiece of escalating suspense and tension. The conclusion is foregone but the way the conclusion is reached is fantastic.Ultimately, the movie is not perfect with some dull, repetitive scenes and unnecessary scenes which are obvious padding. But there is one perfect thing about this movie and it is Joe Spinell. Do watch it if you like Grindhouse-style movies and like your horror in-your-face.

I don't care about the fact that it's only an hour and thirty seven minutes, or that people are saying it's not that good. A Die Hard fan,................with the pun intended would want to see this movie! What was it that you said?? Yippie kayee Mother F-ker??? - Hans Gruber. If I want to raise my adrenaline, or get pumped up for a good work out, these are the kinds of movies I prefer to watch. Yeah, I'm the guy who is hooting and hollering at the screen, but that just proves my point that this is one of those movies that keeps the audience going. On July 14, 2013, Die Hard will be officially turning twenty-five. That really makes me feel old, especially considering I will be turning 30 as my all time fave, BTTF will be turning 30, so happy 25th anniversary Die Hard!!!!!
