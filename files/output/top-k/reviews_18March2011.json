[{"date":"18 March 2011","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" It is virtually impossible to come across a 10 Best Films List from any serious critic or film institution that does not have Citizen Kane ensconced in the Number 1 slot. I have literally heard film historians who insist that if you don't like this film, then you don't like films. Well, I happen to love films and I do not especially like Citizen Kane and, refreshingly, I see from many of the comments there are legions of people that also do not appear to like this film much either. Much of the aggrandizement stems from the high esteem that the film industry and critics held auteur Orson Welles and the empathy they had for Welles in the obstacles that he faced in making this film. Yet while one can appreciate the single-minded ferocity an artist can have in bringing forth a vision &#x96; one must also admit that many times the end product of that vision is not a masterpiece. Welles' melodrama, which is a thinly veiled depiction of the life of legendary power broker William Randolph Hearst, put him on the wrong side of the publishing magnate, who did not like having his life be the subject of a film and set forth the dogs of war to try to hamper Welles. Many critics gathered around Welles and starting inventing superlatives to describe the end result as an antidote. At the time, this picture caused quite the controversy and became a cause célèbre. Unfortunately, decades after the death of Hearst, when many new film watchers barely know who he was, the film must be judged on its own merits and not the controversy it caused in its day, and that is where the film falls apart.The film opens with the death of its central character, the obscenely wealthy Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles) and his whispered dying word of Rosebud. A group of journalists go on the hunt to figure out the meaning of what or who is Rosebud, and we get to see Kane's life unfold in retrospect based on the investigations of journalist Joseph Cotton. Rosebud is the film's central mystery, but it is basically a McGuffin. People going into the film familiar with the answer will find the proceedings utterly pointless. Those unfamiliar with the identity of Rosebud may be less charitable once they realize that they have been gamed into hanging on for something so trivial. In fact, it is almost laughable as to how slight the storyline ends up being.Welles depicts everything on screen at arm's length. There is no character to draw the viewer into the events that unfold or to win sympathy. They are all just ciphers moving in and out of the frames. Emotionally, the film is positively glacial. The acting, even by Welles himself, is outrageously stiff. Events befall the central character and have minimal impact and thus the viewer has absolutely no reason to be impressed by them. Fans of the film drone on and on about shots and camera effects as though great film's succeed on those merits at the expense of story, acting, style and substance. Welles, the director, overuses the canard of mammoth Gothic sets that dwarf his characters to emphasize their purported loneliness or disenfranchisement. This may have been impressive at the time, but now it merely seems a ploy to compensate for the tepid dialog and stale performances. Anyone who truly wants to give director James Cameron grief about his dialog really needs to go back and listen to Citizen Kane with an unbiased ear. Additionally, the much lauded darkness of the film and trick camera shots that earned Welles praise for his cinematic decisions become far less impressive when one realizes that Welles directed and photographed ALL of his films in this fashion, whether it was warranted (Journey Into Fear) or not (The Magnificent Ambersons). It was simply his directorial style and he offered no other alternatives in his career because it was all he knew how to do. Unlike other films of the era which are still impressive, even if we don't like their point of view (Gone With the Wind comes to mind), it is difficult to even understand how Citizen Kane rated as a great film in its day. Its central character remains aloof and the grand secret of Rosebud leaves most viewers I know shrugging their shoulders, if not lamenting the loss of time it took to find out about it. The revelation, rather than arousing sympathy or understanding for Kane, fails to make him any more accessible and, like the camera work, ends up coming off as a last-minute gimmick to try to make Kane the man seem more human than we have witnessed in compensation for the lack of development during the course of the film due to the weaknesses of the writing and acting.And finally, for those film historians\/critics who are still thumping their chests 70 years after the fact as to how the Oscar voters gave the Best Picture to How Green Was My Valley over Citizen Kane, the answer is quite obvious to someone watching the films with fresh eyes. HGWMV may have its share of downbeat moments and may not be perfection, but it contains in its running time more emotion, character development and solid storytelling than Citizen Kane is able to muster on its best day. It is far and away the more accessible film for viewers emotionally - then and now.

Different genres make different movies and generate different emotions, of course, but this movie totally succeeds in evoking a lot of feelings, and doing everything right. It is truly a work of art &#x96; and I am not even talking about effects alone; they are still top notch today, simply incredible for 1982. The Casting is great; all characters are played well and they are all individuals, both fitting the profile of the person you would expect to work in remote areas, as well as making it convincing anyone could later be one of those Things also. Because the people in the movie are all so different, and yet all so human and convincing, it is as if you see the story unfold through your own eyes. This distance of observer to the subject is what great art can keep at bay, and this movie excels in it. All through the end the film stays utterly unpredictable, since almost never we get to know more than the guys in the movie. Therefore, again, it feels like we are there ourselves, cleverly creating a bond between us and the humans in the movie. We never know who is who, who will make it and who won't. But we all hope 'we' make it in the end. Just as in the people struggling for survival in the Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, we feel the sense of loss as the movie progresses and mankind is slowly but surely taken over; the powers and knowledge of the Alien power might be infinitely bigger than ours and its superiority is maybe meant to survive us, but what it lacks is of course emotion, feelings, all that makes humans to special and worth fighting for. The Thing also excels in storytelling. Take the beginning. Action and setting plus players straight away, the landscape of the Arctic, the eerie pulsating beat of the GREAT soundtrack (also 10\/10, you just feel the gloomy future on mankind if the Thing gets into civilized areas), a helicopter chasing a dog, the crew just as us looking at it, thinking what the Sam Hill? Just as them, we will soon find out. Great art, whether it is a story, a painting or a movie, plays cleverly with our unconscious desires, fears and fantasies. What is shown and not told, is in the Thing just as powerful as what is not shown, but only told, leaving it up to us to fantasize. Instead of showing the inside of the UFO, or how the alien looked like in the ice, we see a distant black and white video of the doomed crew in the snow, as if it was an old Arctic exploration team a hundred years ago. It would be tantalizing to see the UFO from the inside, and the Alien too, but to not do it is the perfect choice of the director, leaving it to our own fantasies to work it out, thus creating suspense. We know the alien is old, came from far away, imitated life on a million planets, is smart, powerful and now it wants us. Even the computer prognosis of 'doc' is creepy if it reaches civilized areas, entire world copied in around three years. But do we really believe in 'this voodoo nonsense'? (Even the dialogues in the movie are 10 out of 10). We do when we see the character Bennings burnt down, howling, with hands half finished, half human, half the unimaginable monster that is underneath, we know the Thing might indeed truly be amongst us. Of course, in reality it probably taps the subject of humans themselves we are all capable of love, but also of burning Jews in gas chambers. We have wonderful visions, we can be brave, but we also have nightmares and fears. Not all that is human we are proud of. Together with the big picture, also used in the Bodysnatchers, it is all about society getting violent and less human, no government after Nixon can be trusted, et cetera, further tapping in on paranoia. The Thing is maybe not so different from us, maybe it is already here, after all&#x85; What this movie DOES show,wow, how magnificent can special effects be? And how unpredictable? The shape shifting of one of them turning into a werewolf cum spider is unforgettable and still terrifying today when I see it. It was lucky CGI wasn't available then, making it all look more organic and realistic than any computer could have made it.The setting of the story, and the movie, is also great a closed environment, violent weather outside, a violent unseen creature inside suspense guaranteed. But to keep it from sagging, the story even succeeds changing in the end, when the Thing realizes it has no way out of there, and wants to freeze again, waiting for a possible rescue team to pick it up. It is then not anymore about who is who, but a race against the elements who will be the last to die? If it is the Thing, mankind will be doomed in the future. In a grand finale we see the whole combined shapes into one monster creature, an idea taken over by James Cameron in the end of Terminator. So when the last remaining character suddenly appears and asks Kurt Russell 'did you kill it?', we know he did, or did he? Perfect dialogue again, indirect, since Kurt Russell replies where were you? Well, he got lost in the storm and so it is the end, creepy and eerie to the last second 'how do we make it?' 'Maybe we shouldn't?' Not only a 10 out of 10, but one in a million!

While Thorton appeared a capable actor, I never could appreciate why he was so revered in the mid to late 90's.Until I finally witnessed 'Sling Blade' 15 years later after its release.The film itself, about a mentally challenged man sent to a mental institution for the criminally insane at the age of 12 and life after his release, is about as complete a film as you will ever find. The dialog is superb, the settings are superb, camera work is superb. The supporting characters are superb even though some of the acting leaves something to be desired. They often feel sweet and disarming which seems to contrast with the fine acting skills brought by Thorton and other main characters.The choice of shots is often gripping when they are unexpected. Most of the film is unremarkable in angles and use of perspectives but every once in awhile, at just the right moment, the director gets you. There is a bridge Thorton's character Karl crosses. The bridge is shown twice and Karl pauses in the same place each time at the vertex of two trusses. These shots are visually engrossing as your eye cannot help but follow the lines leading to this character you grow to admire and love.The dialog is unadorned. Language is not used to impress but to express the character's personality without any pretension. I particularly find two scenes engrossing. The first is a domestic argument between Linda Wheatley who took Karl in and her abusive boyfriend Doyle. We see Linda take a stand which belied the inner strength we thought she did not possess but she never cursed; she just stood her ground and let her son Frank, who was about 12, throw cans at Doyle and vent his bottled anger at him. Another is a well referenced interplay between Frank and Karl. When anyone asks why Frank likes Karl the answer is simple I like the way he talks. After Karl moves into Linda's garage, Frank states I like the way you talk, to which Karl replies I like the way you talk too. The entire movie avoids delusions of grandeur by any of its characters which allows us to fully appreciate what they try to say instead of admiring how they say it.The plot is divine but the real gem of this movie is the gifts Billy Bob Thorton delivered. His character Karl is indelible and will likely eternally live on as a classic. As the screenwriter and director, Thorton knew at all turns what he wanted from each character and the actors selected were fantastic. John Ritter as Vaughn, Dwight Yoakum as Doyle, Robert Duvall as Karl's father and other accomplished actors kept to the simple idea of being nothing more than their character warranted. In the end, the simple prevailed and the climax was the most satisfying anti-climax ever; the most appropriate description for it may be 'sublime'.I still do not have an appreciation for Billy Bob Thorton as a person but I can now say about his rocket rise to praise and fame Now I get it. It has been 15 years and in my opinion, 'Sling Blade' is already a classic.

The dialog is superb, the settings are superb, camera work is superb. The supporting characters are superb even though some of the acting leaves something to be desired. They often feel sweet and disarming which seems to contrast with the fine acting skills brought by Thorton and other main characters.The choice of shots is often gripping when they are unexpected. Most of the film is unremarkable in angles and use of perspectives but every once in awhile, at just the right moment, the director gets you. There is a bridge Thorton's character Karl crosses. The bridge is shown twice and Karl pauses in the same place each time at the vertex of two trusses. These shots are visually engrossing as your eye cannot help but follow the lines leading to this character you grow to admire and love.The dialog is unadorned. Language is not used to impress but to express the character's personality without any pretension. I particularly find two scenes engrossing. The first is a domestic argument between Linda Wheatley who took Karl in and her abusive boyfriend Doyle. We see Linda take a stand which belied the inner strength we thought she did not possess but she never cursed; she just stood her ground and let her son Frank, who was about 12, throw cans at Doyle and vent his bottled anger at him. Another is a well referenced interplay between Frank and Karl. When anyone asks why Frank likes Karl the answer is simple I like the way he talks. After Karl moves into Linda's garage, Frank states I like the way you talk, to which Karl replies I like the way you talk too. The entire movie avoids delusions of grandeur by any of its characters which allows us to fully appreciate what they try to say instead of admiring how they say it.The plot is divine but the real gem of this movie is the gifts Billy Bob Thorton delivered. His character Karl is indelible and will likely eternally live on as a classic. As the screenwriter and director, Thorton knew at all turns what he wanted from each character and the actors selected were fantastic. John Ritter as Vaughn, Dwight Yoakum as Doyle, Robert Duvall as Karl's father and other accomplished actors kept to the simple idea of being nothing more than their character warranted. In the end, the simple prevailed and the climax was the most satisfying anti-climax ever; the most appropriate description for it may be 'sublime'.I still do not have an appreciation for Billy Bob Thorton as a person but I can now say about his rocket rise to praise and fame Now I get it. It has been 15 years and in my opinion, 'Sling Blade' is already a classic.

That was during the early 70s, after I watched 3 movies that may deservedly be called classics Dr. Strangelove, 2001 and ACO. But that was a long time ago, long before I saw some other movies of him, last year, and I started wondering if I hadn't been wrong after all; if I hadn't just overrated him.But after seeing ACO for the first time since the early 70s I realize I hadn't been wrong. If one of his films deserves to be called enduring masterpiece, this is it. As for 2001, I agree that's a classic too, but dated. And what proves it to me is that, while what I read now in ACO reviews is exactly what people were saying when the film was released (it's about violence, social engineering & free will) the same thing doesn't apply to 2001. The truth is, back then we didn't take Kubrick's monolith & visual acid trip too seriously and just assumed the film was simply his poetic version of what space travel could be, while today's viewers engage in all sorts of esoteric flights of the imagination to find in it some kind of metaphysical hidden meaning. That's what makes 2001 so dated to me.ACO is perhaps the most original of Kubrick's films and one of the most imaginative in film History. A rare case where a filmmaker creates a self contained universe; and one successful at that. Already during the first shots, in the milk bar, we feel we are for a treat the atmosphere, the settings, the mood, the surreal patrons, send the film right up into classic territory. This is a work of art and at the same time a cry of alarm because of where our hedonistic, desensitizing, society is going to. What K. was saying with Alex was that there'd be plenty like him in the future. And how right he was! By 1971 juvenile crime was unheard of, except in the ultra lower classes and mainly because of poverty, parental abandonment or mental illness. It was only later that the middle class started contributing with its own breed of young killers for thrill or for money (as the Menendez bros.) and for whom rape or murder is just a light pastime. Sadly, Kubrick, who was portraying in his films the hopes of mankind (space travel, the cosmic rebirth of Man) as well as its fears (random violence, the birth of a new generation of toughs) proved wrong in the first case while deadly accurate in the second.This is a moral film, not in a preachy way but in that it makes us confront some of the moral ugliness pervading our society from top to bottom (The scene of the Minister spoon feeding Alex is brilliant.) In ACO Kubrick neither justifies nor condemns anything; he just submits things to his cold, clinical, stare. That Alex doesn't pay for his crimes, that he's instead rewarded, only mirrors what occurs in our society to those being at the right time in the right place. Also, despite what some say, K. is not portraying Alex as sympathetic--you may like him or not--but as the product of an artificial, plasticized, society (watch his mom, isn't she a doll?). There's no moral lesson to be learned here--as there's no moral in that those who caused the 2008 bank crisis got out of it richer than they were before. That's ACO's world, our own. As for violence, it shows it as its occurs, the camera being just a neutral witness, but also in a stylized way, softening rough edges with exaggerated theatricals--even with the use of cartoons for the murder--so we won't take them as literal, authentic events, and accentuating even more the purely artistic nature of it all with Beethoven, Rossini. (note anyway that all rapes are shown here as the brutal acts of violence they are, so no Neanderthal may argue that the victims were looking for it).As N. Shyamalan, Kubrick had also a character related weakness he just couldn't develop them, make them evolve, and because of that most appear static in his films (Alex remains a bastard all along). That's why his most successful films are those in which he didn't try to portray them in their all psychological complexity, as he unfortunately did in The Shinning, resorting instead to showing them as one-dimensional creatures floating in an enthralling atmosphere, swimming in the midst of breathtaking settings, illuminated by gorgeous cinematography, to the point of making us forget, or not care about, the fact that they were simple cardboard cuts. That is why the mentioned films are so successful. (Is there one single character in ACO you could properly call human? No, they are all cartoon figures more than anything else--specially that probation adviser, yes?).In all, an always relevant classic and probably so for many years to come. 9\/10.

You get Ridley Scott's White Squall. This film is based on a true story from 1960 when a group of schoolboys took to the open seas to learn about discipline and becoming a man. The ship is called the Albatross and the captain is the hard boiled Christopher Sheldon, played by Jeff Bridges. The boys learn about what it takes to become a man and the self discipline needed to be an honorable and respected individual. But it is a tragic storm that teaches them some difficult lessons about life and death.This film is, for the most part, a character driven story. This is a real problem when you could care less about any of the characters. Character with daddy issues. Check. Macho man who can't read or write. Check. Highly intelligent character that, despite all his book smarts, still has a lot to learn. Check. One dimensional narrator. Check. The list goes on, but my point is that this film has all the necessary stereotypes for your most typical coming of age story. Thus this film permits nothing new or interesting. Another problem could be that there are just too many characters. The film tries to develop all of the boys and they are subsequently underdeveloped. You don't have enough time or information to develop a connection with any one character and so everything that happens with these boys is incredibly uninteresting. There is also a very flat dynamic between characters. They are all pretty white boys that come from upper class American families making the characters devoid of any kind of diversity.The biggest issue here is that the film truly believes it possesses everything I just said it didn't have. It tries so hard to be a gripping drama but its character development completely missed the mark, making all of these dramatic scenes silly and moronic. I could care less about one boys success at learning how to read and write from the help of two other boys because his character is obnoxious, underdeveloped, and flat. Yet the film tries so hard to elicit an emotional response here that I want to ignore it even further.Aesthetically this film is a different story. Ridley Scott is in no way a bad director, it just seems like he had a serious string of duds post Blade Runner. He makes the most out of White Squall with an epic scale ocean scope. The climactic scene of the film is the terrible storm that hits the Albatross and Scott shoots this scene magnificently. He manages to make this the only truly dramatic moment of the film and the scene manages to be as riveting as is possible for such a lackluster film. In a way this makes the film more of a disappointment. If I had cared more about the film before the epic storm scene, this scene would have been more powerful than it already was. It really makes me wish more effort had been put into the first two thirds of the film because the last third, even after the storm scene, is pretty decent.

It was a very long two hours to discover that I hadn't.The film is beautifully shot, the script looks like it is going somewhere, and we wait for something to happen. And we wait.The film feels exactly like Waiting for Godot. In both the play and the film, nothing happens. Two major differences between them is that in the play, the author (and the audience) knows nothing is going to happen, and the film doesn't know this. The other huge difference is that nothing happens in the play in a fun and entertaining way, while the film...doesn't.James Caan tries very hard playing a military man, but he looks and sounds like James Caan wearing a uniform. I never got the sense that I was looking at an actual soldier. His character is quiet and distant, and we are supposed to relate to him on an emotional level, as he is the core of the film.POSSIBLE SPOILERS Unfortunately, we can't, despite the fact that the film tries to build a relationship between him and a peace activist (we know how many soldier\/peace activist relationships there were then), Angelica Huston, who seems as convincing an activist as Caan is a soldier. So what are we left with? That is the question that haunted me throughout the film.There is the obligatory confrontation between the stereotypical long-haired unappreciative liberal and James Caan at a party. The liberal attacks Caan verbally, then lays his hands on him (peaceniks are like that). Caan responds by punching him several times in the throat, then while the hippie liberal is lying face down in the dirt gasping, grinds his face into the dirt with his shoe in the back of the guy's head, as if he is putting out a cigarette. Someone has to pull him off the guy.This scene was carefully set up as a central moment in the film. What was the point of it? I guess (and I found myself guessing at a lot of the deeper meaning of some of the dialogue and scenes), it is to show that Caan is a soldier who has seen too much war, is in a place he doesn't want to be in (burying young dead soldier's whose sacrifice is scorned) when he would rather be fighting, and is surrounded a nation hostile to the war and the soldiers who fight it.However, if Coppola wanted to present that, he should have presented it differently than this. The effect of the scene is to make us either want to call a cop and have him taken away, or to get the hell away from him to avoid brushing into him accidentally and having the same thing happen to us.In the end, Caan tells his peace activist girlfriend that he has decided to sign on for another tour of duty as an errand of mercy to try to save more young lives from being senselessly wasted.The movie ends shortly thereafter, with Caan saluting a dead soldier's coffin at a funeral.But let's back up here for a moment to the poignant moment when Caan tells Huston he is going back to 'Nam, to save young men's lives.Caan knows this is a losing war.

Pee-wee Herman is one of the few comparable figures we have in modern times. It's not the slapstick and sight gags that he has in common with the silent comics, although there is a fair bit of that in Big Adventure. No, what really makes Pee-wee a great comedy figure is that his comedy is driven by his character. Like Chaplin, Lloyd and Buster Keaton, Paul Reubens developed his persona (Pee Wee Herman) and the stories sprang from that character's potential.At the time of Big Adventure's release, many in the audience would be familiar with the character from the popular Pee-wee Herman Show. The opening moments of the movie however introduce Pee-wee and his brand of humour, his childlike playfulness his Heath Robinson-esque inventiveness. And like Chaplin before him Pee Wee is constantly interacting with his environment, exploring it, making bizarre gags out of everyday objects. The comedy in Pee-wee's Big Adventure takes many forms &#x96; wordplay, cheeky satire, crazy leaps of logic &#x96; but it all stems simply from the Pee-wee character's encounters with one road-movie cliché after another. It's the mixture of familiar situations and the oddball tangents with which Pee-wee enters them that keep the laughs coming.Pee-wee's Big Adventure is also noted for being the feature debut of Tim Burton. Although this is very much Pee-wee's movie, the distinctive cult director still lays his now-familiar print upon it. Even then Burton was clearly getting himself heavily involved in the production design and cinematography, and he has this uncanny knack for making normal things look strange and baroque. He uses an odd mix of bright colours and the kind of high-contrast lighting more often scene in black and white. He throws in the occasional odd angle to heighten things further, but normally his crowded shot compositions and the pure weirdness of the sets themselves is enough. A great Burton moment is when Pee-wee realises his bike has been stolen, with the once innocent-looking mechanical clown now appearing nasty and mocking. I would say that Burton even allows the sets and props to overshadow Pee-wee, but nothing could really do that. As it is, Burton's visual creativity provides a nice counter-balance for the hero, stopping him becoming too wearing on the audience.Pee-wee's Big Adventure is certainly hilarious from start to finish, but a great comedy picture should be more than that. The movie also provides a well-rounded story, and that gives the audience a sense of satisfaction. On his journey Pee-wee seems to spread a little joy and goodness to everyone he meets, and this is important because it makes him a proper hero rather than just a funny man.

Moore, Madeleine Stowe as his wife Julie, and Sam Elliot as Sgt. MaJ. Plumley, is set in 1964. The Plot and theme of this film are both about War; however, the plot is about the survival of a combat unit in one of the first battles in the conflict of Vietnam. The theme centers on the brother hood and unity of the soldiers of this conflict, as they fight for victory and survival against over whelming odds. This film shows much more than a traditional film in the war genre. It depicts the soldiers as individuals with everyday struggles and that of the families they leave behind while fighting. (Wallace, 2002)This film is unique in my opinion, because it is the first war film that I have seen that tells the story of soldier's on both sides of the conflict, as men, details the fear, anger and frustration felt on both sides, while providing the audience with a realistic view from the objective point of view. The closes up shots on the faces depict the feelings of the actor's without need for voice over narration or explanation. The lighting and special effects of the film add a sense of realism, where the action and the effects flow together well. This is not a typical war film where the simple objective is to blow up as many things as possible. When Lt Col Moore and Sgt Plumley are talking about the possibility of defeat, the hard-nosed sgt.

It starts with a group of kids playing a game in an abandoned building that turns horribly wrong. A young girl they were picking on falls out the top window to her death. The kids decide to keep quiet about their involvement in the incident. They don't know that someone was there and saw everything that happened. Fifteen years later, it's prom night at the high school and all those kids are now grown up getting ready to graduate. A mysterious, unseen person starts calling all of the people that were involved in the little girl's death years ago, spooking each of them. Soon after, most of the teenagers start getting murdered during prom. Most of the deaths are in the actual school when no one is around. All of this leading up to a well done ending which reveals the killer's identity.This is what the 80's were about. This disco music, the dancing, the fashion! It's just a great 80's horror film. The disco\/music score is amazing. Prom Night is known as a slasher flick, but I would say it's more of a murder mystery. We actually have to guess who the killer is. There are actually quite a few suspects. The deaths were probably well done, but on the DVD versions, the quality is so poor you can barely make out who is who. Jamie Lee Curtis and the late Leslie Nielsen rock their roles of course. However another actress, Eddie Benton, adds real energy to the film also as the vixen Wendy.The killer dresses in all black including a black ski mask with cut out eye holes. His main (and only) weapon is a large axe. The one particular chase scene is Wendy's. He chases her around the interior of the darkened school for a good ten minutes. There are some really tense scenes as the killer pops out of everywhere trying to kill her with his wielding axe. The film location of the dark high school at night really add a spooky feeling to the movie. It's amazing.All of the characters are root-able. You really feel for most of them, even the vicious Wendy. The poor girl gets chased around the classrooms for so long, you almost want her to make it out of the movie alive. This is a very creepy and underrated horror film that should be seen by all.

I wanted to have watched it, though, to provide context for when I eventually watch Wall Street Money Never Sleeps, and the fact that it stars Charlie Sheen made it all the more relevant and fascinating. Charlie, as Bud Fox, is in nearly every scene of the movie, and given recent events it was hard to watch for anything other than his performance. Having watched and enjoyed Platoon last year, though, I wasn't really surprised that he performed quite well in this one as well. He was dark and brooding and very intense, and more or less nailed the role, even intermittently causing me to forget that I was watching Charlie Sheen. Michael Douglas also did a fantastic job at embodying the ruthless, unscrupulous character he was portraying. That character, in turn, embodied the tone and the overarching theme of the movie, most notably with his famous greed is good speech. In fact, Michael Douglas was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor for this role, and I would say deservedly so, although I haven't seen any of the other performances that were nominated that year. Martin Sheen was also great as Bud's father, but his casting made it so that, again, examining the acting - in this case Charlie and Martin's father-son dynamic - was more interesting than watching the actual movie. Add that to Charlie's mere presence, Darryl Hannah's lack of charm, wit, or sexiness as Bud's love interest, and the laughable 80's- style art, decor, fashion and technology that featured in the movie and it made for an overwhelming number of distracting factors that precluded any real immersion in the movie itself. In the end though, the main distracting factor - studying Charlie Sheen - is also the most compelling reason to watch, at least at this point in time. Combine that with Michael Douglas' performance and Wall Street becomes quite a worthwhile viewing experience.

Many of the characters are awful people, and as a viewer, you really care less whether they live or die (most of them die). Eventually, a small portion of the group latch onto a raft and float to New York City. Jason somehow gets to NYC (I think he must've walked there underwater or something). He kills a few more leading to up a decent ending in the sewers of the city.Jason Voorhees is super human in this one folks. He manages to move from one place to the next in the blink of an eye. One minute he's on the deck of the ship, the next he's standing in New York City. He like many other horror icons at this time, is no longer scary. He's a complete joke, a cartoon. There are some good parts to it though, like a guy getting his head punched off by the masked madman. And the scenes in Times Square and the New York subway were fun to watch.

Little is missed - but the basic point of the movie is the emptiness of the television industry and the mindless and thoughtless generation the media was producing. As Howard Beale (Peter Finch) points out to his audience, everything they know they know from television, because only 3% of them read books and only 15% read newspapers. So the cynicism was a good match for the society in which the movie was made, and much of the philosophizing was bang-on and even prophetic. The performances - mainly from Finch, Faye Dunaway as the Vice President of Programming for the fictional UBS network and William Holden as the head of the news department were convincing in a satirical sort of way, meaning they're not to be taken too seriously except as caricatures of what they represent. I also loved the irony of the Communist Party and the left wing terrorist group being recruited to help with a new UBS terrorist of the week show and then being shown discussing the details of the contract they were signing. There's also the very relevant point of the news department being taken over by programming and being used for entertainment purposes rather than real news. (The movie is prophetic in that UBS in that sense is a bit of a forerunner to FOX News!) So a lot of this is quite good and worthwhile.Some aspects of this don't hold up quite as well, though. For example, although I found it funny (and I'm not even sure why, except that I grew up in the 70's) that The Howard Beale Show had performed the unimaginable task (for a new show) of rising to 4th in the ratings - behind only The Six Million Dollar Man, All In The Family and Phyllis, I don't know that this would register with viewers today. The power of television has declined I would say in recent years due to the growth of the internet (although the same concerns might be raised about this modern medium.) Still, one can't really criticize a 1976 movie for having aspects that don't hold up well in 2011. The movie was made for a 1976 audience, after all. Of more concern to me (which accounts for the low rating) was an over-emphasis on personal melodrama. That was perhaps also an accurate reflection of the culture of the day, but I found it distracted too much and too repeatedly from the devastating satire of the TV news industry. I also found that - as good as it was as satire - it was almost too much. Howard Beale stopped being interesting to me fairly quickly, for example.Basically, I'd characterize this as a good example of a good 1970's movie that was made for the 1970's.
