I watched it for the first time, and I was completely blown away. Everyone should see this movie. This made every curiosity about drugs that I had disappear. Sarah was my favorite character, and you get so caught up with her, and wonder why she is doing harm to herself. You wouldn't believe some of the things you see happen in this movie. And the craziest part is...all of what is depicted in the film, are all possibilities of reality. Everything shown in the movie could very well happen to real people in the real world. This movie scared me into not ever wanting to try any type of drug, for the fear of what could happen to me; also for the fear of becoming addicted to something that I don't need in my body. Everyone go to the video store and rent this movie.

What?? I mean, can you REALLY feel empathy for anyone in Armageddon prior to falling asleep?Deep Impact isn't a masterpiece either, obviously. There are some flaws in the plot, both scientifically and as regards continuity and some coincidences that basically don't happen in ordinary life. But there is quite a lot to enjoy. I'm not an avid fan of flicks dealing with the possible end of the world or of the human race (like, as I said before, Armageddon - and then Independence Day, Godzilla, and so on) but this one shines in its own right, as an earnest attempt to create a series of three-dimensional characters in an action-based film and take time to show their intimate side. The writers and the actors deserve some praise to have put up a gallery of men and women you can't help to care about. A lot of critical reviews about this film deal with the boredom they have suffered from watching Deep Impact... but what about the hour and a half of total mess and dumb dialogue armageddon is filled with? And you tell me that you care about the characters? Please. There should be characters first!For example, like Téa Leoni's Jenny a young reporter in search of a scoop who finds herself projected in front of a camera having to tell the entire world what destiny it is facing, while she is struggling with her family's complicated and sad past. Vanessa Redgrave's Robin, Jenny's mother, a woman who should have been born in another century, devastated from her not recent at all but painful divorce - yet, still worried of saving her seventeenth-century desktop by donating it to the National Gallery, and concerned about her make-up and dress when she decides to commit suicide. Robert Duvall's brave but sweet Captain Fish, last man on the Moon, who gradually becomes a father for his crew and, ultimately, for all mankind. Elijah Wood and Leelee Sobieski's Leo and Sarah, the two teenagers strongly in love with each other, a symbol for all the people who desperately struggle to survive. Morgan Freeman as the President, and then Laura Innes, Maximilian Schell, Mary McCormack, all provide touching supportive performances.If you feel in the mood of watching an action flick with a different perspective, watch Deep Impact, and you won't help but care about the men and women involved in a believable enough disaster. If you want to eat a popcorn after another, rent Armageddon and enjoy the mess.
