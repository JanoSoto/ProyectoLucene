Granted there is little real estate left for an original idea in the story-telling industry, but the incessant make-more-out-it pitch to the studio is what the positive critics must have latched onto when they were being bought off by their fringe-benefit sponsors to write good reviews.Bugs Bunny did a better job as Lenny(?) than Paxton did as the pseudo intelligent\/sensitive older brother who was faced with making all the important decisions up until the end. And Billy George(?) Bob Thornton might understand the challenges of the mentally disabled, but he need not agree to portray one whose actions are the sole and unrealistic justification for the murders that artificially drive the story. I wonder if Jane Fonda will ever come to terms with her daughter's incessant teenage struggle for identity--Bridget has no on-screen presence let alone chemistry with Paxton who himself seems to have graduated from the Keanu Reeves School of Expressionless and Constipated Acting (they should have been mimes or gone into weightlifting). The cinematography and editing is juvenile from opening cross fade of the crow and the hit-me-with-a-hammer symbolism of the fox in the hen house through what other critics compare Fargo with right to the horribly uninventive angles during action or character revelation sequences. The camera was too far away for much of the time for anyone to sympathize with any of these numbskull characters. And for the amount of screen time that the police had in the story, don't you think that any one of the crime scene investigations would have revealed unsubstantiated blood spray patterns or weapons with too few and misplaced fingerprints on them? The underlying tension in this film is clearly the audience's struggle to suspend their disbelief in a story that actually moves slowly enough for some characters to actually figure out whodunnit. At least we didn't have put to up with an homage to Straw Dogs and have every dummy gang up on one guy and his bimbo wife and have the town blame the retard.I give this movie a 2 only because of its seed idea, taken so thoughtlessly from John Steinbeck and plugged into most likely a first novel that was adapted just as badly.I recommend you watch this film, so that you can see what an all-round poor quality film looks like.

You can say that this movie is like a Mad Max version of a post-apocalypse world, only set at sea. Only problem is; they made the story look about as least interesting as it can get.There are several issues with Waterworld and the directing and story are definitely two of it. The story itself had definitely potential but there are several problems with it. The concept was good but the story itself is for most part too simple and childish. Of course when one of the main characters of the movie is a child, the movie itself also very easily tends to become a childish one. This is definitely the case with Waterworld. The movie fails to focus on the good and interesting elements of the movie and it instead chooses to lay the emphasis of the story on the Mariner (Kevin Costner) and his building relationship with Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and Elona (Tina Majorino), which happens to be the least interesting aspect of the entire movie. It makes the movie more of a drama like one, rather than the cool action flick it could and should had been. It also seriously takes the pace out of the movie. The middle of the movie is especially too slow and filled with rather needless sequences and long boring shots of nothing but blue water and a boat. So it's not just a bad, simple, childish story but also bad storytelling and directing by Kevin Reynolds and Kevin Costner.The movie and the story could perhaps had worked if they had made out to be an interesting one. They firstly could had done this by creating a different main character. Having a character who rarely speaks and who also happens to be a mutant for reasons unexplained in the movie, just isn't a terribly interesting one. The fact that Kevin Costner plays the part also doesn't help much. Nothing wrong with his acting in this movie, after all he rarely says a thing, but its more that he doesn't have enough charisma to play a cool and interesting action hero.The storytelling feels completely incoherent at times. For instance the main villain of the movie, played by Dennis Hopper, basically only pops up at the beginning of the movie and later again toward the ending and finale of the movie. This happens with a lot of characters. The characters are also all extremely stereotyped and they are another reason why I regarded this movie is a quite childish one.The villains are definitely a good thing about this movie. The Smokers are a pretty cool bunch of modern pirates. Dennis Hopper is delicious villainous in his role as their leader. When he enters the screen the movie revives but like I mentioned before he is way underused in the movie, which makes his role also not as memorable as many of his others.After watching this movie you can conclude one thing; shooting at sea is expensive. Appereantly this movie cost $175,000,000 to make but his is nowhere to be seen in the movie. Yes sure there are some big and good action sequences but nowhere or anymore spectacular than any other, less expensive, action-flick from the '90's. To be perfectly honest the movie even looked quite amateur like to me at times but this may also be due to the at times childish story and way of storytelling.The early special effects are also not really quite convincing enough.The musical score by James Newton Howard on the other hand is surprisingly good, spectacular and uplifting. Every once in a while Howard delivers a brilliant score. Waterworld is one of those scores.When action occurs on the screen, its definitely a fun and entertaining movie to watch. The movie is just basically your average summer popcorn flick. The action is brought well to the screen and in those sequences the pace is also good and high. It helps to make the movie still worthwhile and also quite an entertaining one.

This is Torch Song Trilogy for the perky-post-teen girls. That Girl for our disaffected, affected millennium times.The dialogue is fast and funny, and Parker Posey's costumer deserves - if not an academy award, at least - a stadium wave of kudos.Of course, this film rests on the very stylish platform heels of Miss Posey, and she is perfectly cast. Like a lot of her acting work, it may not be very deep, it is often self-referential and, well, posey... but it all WORKS. She is a talented comedienne, an incredible entertainer, and this film entertains, she carries it on her shoulders like a faux leopard wrap, and never lets it drop to the floor.Mary is a superficial party fashionista who isn't above stealing designer clothing from a friend's closet or making out with someone else's boyfriend. On a deeper level, this is a story of a girl and her friends who are care-less in every sense of the word, including about other people; and the process of learning that caring is necessary to life. The script is beautifully crafted, witty, and the only performance that disappoints is the Aunt, in a role that was much too one-dimensional and heavy handed; a more nuanced performance from her, would have deepened the relationship between the two... but... hey... this is comedy. A surprisingly deep role, that gives this film some substance and world vision, is the fallafel selling boyfriend. We should all be so lucky... is he the one for Mary? or the one that gets away? I rate this as a 8 because it isn't a great moment of film history, it is not a classic, and it is not great art (all of which get deeper and richer on re-viewing). Like Desperately Seeking Susan it represents something very true about it's time period, but may become irrelevant with time. Still, it has everything an entertaining film needs, and is worth viewing several times for the clothes alone!

Like a lot of her acting work, it may not be very deep, it is often self-referential and, well, posey... but it all WORKS. She is a talented comedienne, an incredible entertainer, and this film entertains, she carries it on her shoulders like a faux leopard wrap, and never lets it drop to the floor.Mary is a superficial party fashionista who isn't above stealing designer clothing from a friend's closet or making out with someone else's boyfriend. On a deeper level, this is a story of a girl and her friends who are care-less in every sense of the word, including about other people; and the process of learning that caring is necessary to life. The script is beautifully crafted, witty, and the only performance that disappoints is the Aunt, in a role that was much too one-dimensional and heavy handed; a more nuanced performance from her, would have deepened the relationship between the two... but... hey... this is comedy. A surprisingly deep role, that gives this film some substance and world vision, is the fallafel selling boyfriend. We should all be so lucky... is he the one for Mary? or the one that gets away? I rate this as a 8 because it isn't a great moment of film history, it is not a classic, and it is not great art (all of which get deeper and richer on re-viewing). Like Desperately Seeking Susan it represents something very true about it's time period, but may become irrelevant with time. Still, it has everything an entertaining film needs, and is worth viewing several times for the clothes alone!

I can watch a three hour movie no problem but with this movie It can really feel like three hours if you are just watching it for the sake of something to watch. Comparison with GoodFellas is inevitable and personally, I think that both movies are just as good as each other. Casino has certain qualities that GoodFellas lacks and GoodFellas has certain qualities that Casino lacks. Casino doesn't quite have the density of secondary characters that enriched the world of GoodFellas. It really felt like a community but then, that was the point of GoodFellas; that Henry Hill was being invited into a big family of sorts and that he would witness it's love and appeal but also it's horror and debauchery. Casino is more centred around 'Ace' Rothstein and Nicky Santoro. The secondary characters are there to provide their cog in the story and then go home. However, Casino has more grit and really conveys the pomp and greed surrounding the so-called high society of Vegas, not just the pathetic punters. It is also a benefit to hear of how the casinos work under the gaze of the Mob through the heavy use of voice-oveR. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are a fantastic double act and one cannot hide a certain envy towards Scorsese that he is able to wield the acting might of these two in his movies. Just seeing them having an argument is an acting tour de force (whatever that means, but I know it's positive). It's amazing that, like Temeura Morrison in 'Once Were Warriors', in that little scene with his son, Joe Pesci can make Nicky Santoro seem sympathetic. This must surely be the hallmark of a great actor. These are two actors at the top of their game under one of the greatest directors of all time, not just today. Enjoy. That said, Sharon Stone is as good as the madonna-cum-whore, Ginger, who starts the movie as a real figure in the world of gambling but ends up as a spiteful junkie, not even caring towards her child. I have not seen many of her films but I am sure that, just like Bruce Willis, if given the right roles or right director, she can act as good as the best of them. The supporting players such as; Don Rickles, James Woods, Kevin Pollack and L.Q. Jones manage to make their characters fresh and interesting in the time space given to them. The violence is one thing that people always comment on when it comes to this film. There is no doubt that it is pretty strong violence but what gets me is that the scene where Nicky stabs that man with the pen never gets a mention whereas the 'head-in-a-vice' scene always does. I see the pen scene as being a whole lot more graphic and shocking than the vice scene. This is because, with the vice scene, you get a couple of big warnings before hand so you know what will happen (also, the violence is more suggested, even though you can see what is happening to the victim, you do not see the gory details). With the pen scene, however, it takes you totally off guard. The close up of the pen entering the neck is more akin to Hostel than GoodFellas. It certainly took me off guard. What I want to talk about, finally, is the climax. Is it a climax? If so, it is a very played out climax. Maybe because it concerns the fates of several characters in the movie as opposed to just one big bad guy. Certainly Nicky's fate is drawn and bloody and the re-invention of Vegas is a part of that climax. It is a frank and final ending to the film and probably very fitting, as it shows us that crime doesn't pay for some people. In conclusion, I think that Casino is a definite Scorsese classic and one that should gain as much praise as his more lauded works. Despite some minor quibbles, it is up there with the better of Hollywood movies and hopefully will mature as time goes on rather than being regarded as the naughty younger brother of GoodFellas ","genre":null},{"date":"17 July 2006","score":"","review":" First up, you definitely need to be in the mood to see this movie.

As the powerful members pitch their own candidates, the head of the party, at the insistence of his children, selects Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) - a local scout hero. People against this decision are told that Mr. Smith with his boyish charm is a perfect man for the job as he won't ask inconvenient questions and at the same time party will get some middle class support. All hells break loose when Mr. Smith turns out to be a Lincolnian. Mr. Paine, who is the other senator from the state and Jeff's ideal since childhood, slams him with charges of corruption to get rid of him. Jeff is heartbroken with the realities of Washington. He decides to take the next train home but his secretary Saunders (Jean Arthur) who is already jaded with political surroundings helps him fight back. Performance-wise James steward is at his best. He is very convincing as a local hero, a Lincolnian youth and frustrated senator. Jean Arthur is good. She did a little over acting but its OK for comic relief. Claude Rains is very good as Mr. Paine. Edward Arnold is too good. Thomas Mitchell is fantastic as Diz Moore. This movie is extremely comical, serious stuff and jokes are happening at the same time. The film is extremely tight, entertaining and very well crafted. It was my second Capra film. I wanted to watch this film to checkout the senate footage. It turned out to be a huge lesson on US senate for me. This film actually explains lots of processes i.e. Jean Arthur describes how a bill is passed, oath taking ceremony etc. The first half of the film is establishing and humorous. Second half of the film is extremely definitive and to the point. The last 20 minutes of the film are thrilling. I think its one of the best story, dialogs and screenplay I have seen ever.

People against this decision are told that Mr. Smith with his boyish charm is a perfect man for the job as he won't ask inconvenient questions and at the same time party will get some middle class support. All hells break loose when Mr. Smith turns out to be a Lincolnian. Mr. Paine, who is the other senator from the state and Jeff's ideal since childhood, slams him with charges of corruption to get rid of him. Jeff is heartbroken with the realities of Washington. He decides to take the next train home but his secretary Saunders (Jean Arthur) who is already jaded with political surroundings helps him fight back. Performance-wise James steward is at his best. He is very convincing as a local hero, a Lincolnian youth and frustrated senator. Jean Arthur is good. She did a little over acting but its OK for comic relief. Claude Rains is very good as Mr. Paine. Edward Arnold is too good. Thomas Mitchell is fantastic as Diz Moore. This movie is extremely comical, serious stuff and jokes are happening at the same time. The film is extremely tight, entertaining and very well crafted. It was my second Capra film. I wanted to watch this film to checkout the senate footage. It turned out to be a huge lesson on US senate for me. This film actually explains lots of processes i.e. Jean Arthur describes how a bill is passed, oath taking ceremony etc. The first half of the film is establishing and humorous.

Yet again an extraordinary humorous performance bought to us by Reese Witherspoon which makes Legally Blonde a true winner. The film was released on the Thirteenth July 2001 and produced by Mark Platts. It was directed by Australian director Robert Luketic, who made his name directing the award winning short film Titsiana Booberini in 1997. Legally Blondewas Luketic's first mainstream Hollywood film, it took the world by storm being nominated for two golden globes and winning six awards. The screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith is inspired by the book Legally Blonde written by Amanda Brown. The Legally Blonde soundtrack is very girlie and if you listen to the lyrics it's also very strengthening. It is full of songs telling girls that they don't need a guy to tell them they're pretty, to make them beautiful and that they can be a 'one girl revolution,' this is the second song featured on the soundtrack and is sung by a group called Superchick. This soundtrack is a very feminist CD and any girl would love it. Elle Woods, a Hawaiian tropic girl, played by Reese Witherspoon comes across as a stereotypical dumb blonde. She is president of her sorority Delta Nu and has everything any girl would want, including the hottest boyfriend, on campus and dreams of being Mrs. Warner Huntington III. She is Miss June in her sorority calendar, and all above she is a natural blonde. She grew up across the street from Aaron Spelling in LA and this emphasises on how moneyed a background she comes from. Elle is a fashion major, which is so obvious from the beginning but she makes it emphasises on the point even more when she says And last week I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal, and I talked her out of buying this truly heinous angora sweater. Whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed. She absolutely loves shopping and getting pampered, she cares about her looks and her boyfriend a lot and is shocked when he dumps her. Elle has a pet Chihuahua called Bruiser who is also pampered just like Elle and goes everywhere with her, she even throws him birthday parties, and in my opinion this dog lives Elle's life. In Elle's live friends, (including bruiser of course) family and beauty are the three main things and no matter what they always will be. Reese Witherspoon had to prepare for her role as Elle Woods by spending two weeks studying the behaviour of real life sorority girls, as she was concerned that she may portray Elle as a stereotypical airhead. In the DVD commentary Reese points out on how polite and kind these girls actually were and she says she really enjoyed the experience. To emphasise on Elle's blondness Reese Witherspoon went through an amazing forty different hairstyles throughout the duration of the film. In this film Elle wore some absolutely stunning outfits which most girls would dream of and luckily for her, as agreed on the contract she got to keep every single one of them. Witherspoon's acting within this film is a hallmark for her career, and she is still known for it today Warner Huntington III is played by the very much admired actor Matthew Davis. Warner grew up in an east coast blue blood family, and much like Elle is surprisingly rich and spoilt. In his life his parents expect him to go to Harvard Law School to become a future Senator. The only problem is that Warner doesn't think Elle will be smart enough, this shows how shallow his personality is.

Then, it's up to you to reach a conclusion. There are many clichés as you may expect in a movie that portrays a life style.

The day after, with a horrible hang over, they know about the unfortunate events involving the dumb blonde and the footballer. The movie gives you clues in flashbacks and it's now up to you to reach a conclusion.In my opinion, Tara Reid's character wasn't abused.

The side jokes are hilarious, the main punch lines are even funnier, and last but not least- every word out of Vinny Gambini's (Joe Pesci) mouth is absolutely hilarious. From start to finish, this film will have you cracking up and laughing so hard that you'll rewind a majority of the parts a million times and recite every word in each selection. After that point, you'll have the whole movie memorized in about 2-3 nights. I am in utter disbelief that not everyone has voted this movie a perfect 10. The only thing that I can think of that is a negative point for this movie is that after you watch this, Comedy is RUINED...because NOTHING is funny after you watch this. Nothing even comes close to 1\/2 as funny as this masterpiece!

I loved it when he loses his powers and gets them back. Now, I'm 36. Got a kid (4 years old) who loves to watch it. So, now I've seen this Drek 150 times in a month. I cannot believe how bad this movie is on so many levels.Special Effects Horrible. You can see green screen halos in every flight sequence.Villains - Silly and stupid.Set -- clearly a sound stage. Superman I at least had the feeling it was filmed in a live city. SII looks like it was filmed in my basement.Overall Plot - Stupid. Superman would never give up his powers for Lois Lane. Ain't gonna happen. She's a $20 hooker in this movie, a smoker, looks and dresses horribly. What would Superman possibly see in this Lois Lane. She should be the sweet lovable girl next door.. one that we could all fall in love with. Margot Kidder is a joke.The only thing worse than superman II is superman III and superman IV. I feel terrible for Christopher Reeve, but he aided and abetted the destruction of a great franchise.
