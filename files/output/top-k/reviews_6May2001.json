I have lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, and it touches me every time I watch it.  As a matter of fact, I just finished watching this movie on television, on a cable channel that cannot seem to get enough of showing this film.  I'm sure you know the one I mean, because they have shown this movie dozens of times, usually back to back.  If you are a fan of this film, I'm sure you watch it every time it is on, much like I do, and are always amazed, yet again, at the end of it.This film is written so eloquently that I doubt much could top it.  Having not read the original short story by Stephen King (which is titled Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption), I cannot comment on the accuracy of the movie in relation to his telling of story.  However, I'm sure that it does justice to King's writing.  Frank Darabont, who wrote the screenplay and directed Shawshank, also wrote the screenplay for and directed King's other prison film, The Green Mile, which also should not be missed.The acting here is excellent, but I doubt anybody would be surprised at that, given the cast present here.  Morgan Freeman (Se7en, Deep Impact, Kiss The Girls) has shown time and time again that he is one of Hollywood's best and most underrated actors, and he certainly shines here as Red, the man who knows how to get things.  Freeman's narration is superb, I doubt a better job could have been done by anyone else.  In the history of film, people such as James Earl Jones and Martin Sheen never fail to provide narration that is highly eloquent, but this film shows that Freeman deserves to be in the same category as those two actors.  Tim Robbins does a great job as Andy Dufresne, an innocent man who knows he will remain in prison for a long time to come, but refuses to give up hope.Despite excellent writing and acting, however, I believe the most poignant thing about this film is the score.  Present at the best times, and lacking when it should be, the use of the score for this film helps set the tone and the mood for almost every scene.  Obviously, in a film set in a prison, there isn't much happiness to go around.  However, certain scenes in this film are defined by the score that goes with them, making the viewer look twice at a scene which would otherwise be quite drab and seemingly unimportant, and making them appear different than they are, thus impressing the theme of hope on the viewer in an almost subconscious fashion.Historically, of course, this film will never be viewed with the respect and honor it deserves, especially with newer, more appealing prison-based films available, such as the aforementioned The Green Mile.  It is unfortunate that Shawshank didn't win the Academy Awards it was nominated for, because it certainly deserved them.  However, during its Oscar year, it was up against a little Tom Hanks vehicle called Forrest Gump, a movie which held back most others that year, and deservedly so.  As often happens, seemingly to avoid one particular film taking home all the gold, Oscars were awarded to other films over Forrest Gump that year in various categories, and it's too bad that Shawshank wasn't one of them.I guarantee that you will love the characters of Andy & Red, along with the interaction between them; hate Warden Norton and his sniveling sidekick Captain Hadley; and be moved by the eloquent ending of this fantastic and unforgettable film.

The acting and set I'd give an A++ to, the casting maybe a B (was Harry really that old? he was supposed to be a rookie!) but the treatment of the story itself I found very disappointing, particularly when I'd been told how faithful the movie was to the book.A big problem was the cutting of the present-day section of the book, which makes it clear that this story is a memoir this 104-year-old man is writing in an effort to come to terms with his past. Some of the aspects that bothered people in the movie, such as the prison guard characters being so enlightened about race or the main character's wife being so perfect, weren't such a problem in the book as these were all being seen through the lens of memory, over a gap of 60 years. Likewise, all the moral ambiguities that made the book more than just a good yarn totally vanished in the film. In the botched execution, for example, the book makes it crystal-clear that Paul (Tom Hanks' character) has the authority to stop the execution and in fact he sees the execution is being botched in time to stop it. He doesn't, however, because years of looking the other way, not sticking his neck out, not rocking the boat have so thoroughly corrupted him that he lets a man he is responsible for get burned alive rather than make himself conspicuous. In the movie, however, he just looks dumb and oblivious. All the good characters in the movie are totally good; all the bad guys are totally bad and the movie suffers as a result.Similarly, the religious themes in the book were totally excised from the movie except a rather clumsy parable making Coffey a Jesus figure. My theory on that is that Hollywood can actually do a quite good job with stories about well-known religious figures (Moses, Joan of Arc, Peter Marshall, e.g.) but hasn't a clue as to what to do with ordinary Joe characters to whom religion is an important motivation.Very good direction, acting and set; worth seeing if you've read the book and can fill in the blanks.

The acting and set I'd give an A++ to, the casting maybe a B (was Harry really that old? he was supposed to be a rookie!) but the treatment of the story itself I found very disappointing, particularly when I'd been told how faithful the movie was to the book.A big problem was the cutting of the present-day section of the book, which makes it clear that this story is a memoir this 104-year-old man is writing in an effort to come to terms with his past.

They have a nine-year-old son, Alex (Freddie Boath, who could teach The Phantom Menace 's Jake Lloyd a thing or two about acting).

In addition, Oded Fehr returns as the Medjai warrior Ardath Bey, and John Hannah shows up as Evelyn's playboy brother Jonathan.I'll start with what I really liked about this movie.  I liked the chemistry between Rick and Evelyn; I really felt their anguish when Alex was endangered.  Fehr's Bey was very much the Jedi warrior (I know, different movie, but that's what it felt like to me).  The fight scenes were very kinetic and well-photographed.  The large-scale battles were quite rousing, especially considering the difficulties of integrating CGI and live action in a convincing fashion.

We're talking of the strongest puppy-love in history, together with pure, uncontrolled and undirected teenager lust. Did not Shakespeare write that Romeo's flaming and endless love flipped within a second from one young girl (Rosalina) to another (Juliet)? He understood teenager love a lot better than most directors of this play do!Not to say that, in this film, their love isn't _real_. Man, I've never seen so much chemistry on the screen! Forget Danes and diCaprio. They are much better actors but they lose this one. By miles. Millions of miles. But Hussey and Whiting's love is not just that. It is not just chemistry. Not plain love, this pure thing where everybody seems to think R&J is about. Forget it! It is teenage confusion, depression, rebellion, it is being a child and an adult at the same time, it is something they do not understand, it is clumsiness, hardly uncontrollable lust, it is very well possible that this love would turn into pure hatred if it had had some time to develop ... it is, simply said, the most complex and simple thing at the same time.

Even though it may not be rated, this film would definitely get an R Graphic Violence, Strong Language, Nudity, and Drug Content.*     *     *NOTE Before you read this, although not a spoiler, is a very detailed outline of the plot, and should not be read if you want complete surprises when seeing this film.*     *     *It all starts in the year 1988 A blast in Tokyo by Akira is which supposedly began World War III.31 years afterwards, in 2019, Neo-Tokyo has risen from the ashes, and is now a dark, dangerous metropolis.After the kidnapping of Takeshi (No. 26), a powerful psychic, a military action is launched.  Takeshi, although just a child, appears elderly, due to drugs, which were given to enhance his powers.  When found, he is almost hit by Tetsuo, a friend of Ken and Kaneda's, a small biker gang.  In the mess, Tetsuo is injured and taken to a hospital.The next morning, scientists study Tetsuo, to find that he has amazing psychic abilities, and he is given drugs to enhance them.  However, after feeling uncomfortable, Tetsuo wakes up to find every thing in his room destroyed, and escapes.  He finds his girlfriend, but is quickly captured again, and put in the hospital.While in the hospital, Tetsuo is given the enhancing drugs, and begins dreaming of voices telling him that people as strong as him don't deserve his power.While, Kiyoko (No. 25), makes a prediction that the city will crumble, and falls asleep, Takeshi and Masaru (No. 27).Then, suddenly, Tetsuo loses control, the drugs taking over his brain, and his psychic abilities ridiculously powerful.  He seeks the one who can help him overcome all of his enemies, and he must destroy the city to get there.  This person is the last person to have destroyed Tokyo...  Akira!  What follows is an incredible ending, that makes you laugh, cry, feel joy and anger, yet love the plot all the same.But keep in mind Tokyo is about to E. X. P. L. O. D. E..

Would we buy a Porsche and a big new house?  Would we put it in the bank and live off of the interest?  I would say that the vast majority of us have pondered over that one from time to time.  But how far would we go to protect what we found from being taken away from us?  That's the question asked by A Simple Plan.At first it seems like a tale of three lucky guys who find the American dream, in Lou's words. But very quickly the film takes on a feeling of paranoia, mistrust, and later in the film, a profound sadness toward the desperate situation in which the characters find themselves.  Finally, there is a real sense of horror.  Not the grossed-out, unrealistic horror of Friday the 13th or A Nightmare on Elm Street, but a different kind of horror that is not often captured on film.  That horror lies in the fact that the characters in the story are regular people.  They aren't evil, spiteful villains.  They're your next door neighbor.  They're the people you see at the store every day.  They're you and me.  Yet because of their actions, good people end up dead.We must ask ourselves whether we would really do the right thing and turn the money in or keep it if we could find a way to rationalize, just like the characters in the story.  And the fact is that many of us, but not all of course, certainly would try to find a way to keep it.  That's real.  And it lends to the believability of the story.One other point made by the movie that I don't think many have touched on is that people are not always who they seem.  When they first find the money, Jacob, who is dim-witted and seemingly irresponsible, won't hear of turning in the money and is immediately seduced by what he might be able to do with it.  But when the coverups begin and as people begin to die, he feels a deep sense of guilt and wants to give it all up to get it off of his conscience. On the other hand, you have Hank, who has a job and a family and seems to be a morally upstanding and responsible citizen.  His first instinct is to call the police and turn in the money.  But as soon as he finds a rationale for keeping the money, his morals begin to slide.  The more wrong the plan goes, the more desperate he is to cover it all up, perhaps to maintain his falsely moral image as much as to keep the money.  Ultimately his greed consumes him to the point of murdering his own brother.  It goes to show that our real self may be completely different than our public self.This is definitely one of the best tragedy films in quite some time.  Watch it.

Either way, by trying to have it both ways, `Dinosaur' emerges as an uncomfortable mix of National Geographic realism and storybook schmaltziness.  By now, we have all pretty much accepted the rather appalling sentimentalizing of nature that has become standard practice in virtually all mainstream animated films these days.

Of course, `Dinosaur' does feature some `bad' dinosaurs &#150; i.e. those who act according to their real nature &#150; because, like all dramatic works, it needs someone to function as a villain.  But when we find a bunch of furry pre-monkey type creatures befriending and then rearing a lost baby dinosaur into adulthood &#150; and when we find that grown up dinosaur acting as baby sitter and playmate to the children of that mammal tribe &#150; well, something tells us that we are going to be in for a rather sticky time for the duration of the movie.

This film has so many things going for it, a wonderful script, which flicks from tense horror to humour with skill not seen since &#145;An American Werewolf in London'.  And the script also has a depth and emotion which Scream (a film that I like) and the rest (most of which stink) don't have and don't even attempt to have, simply going from one killing to another.  This film is different because the center of this film is the story not the murders, really this film is more of a detective horror then slasher Horror.

It has NO pretensions of being anything more than mainstream action fare.  Whether it's deliberate or not, the writers have made the character of John Rambo nothing more than a cartoon action hero - he embodies everything that is 'American macho'.  This completely over the top (no Stallone pun intended) superhero is thrown into a wonderfully over the top story, where there's never any doubt he'll win and little chance that he'll have too much trouble in his task (a leg wound and a hole through his stomach are just an opportunity to show how incredibly tough and resistant he is).  The action scenes unashamedly adhere to the 'Hollywood guide to entertaining violence' (probably in existence somewhere) and the viewer is exposed to endless guns, bullet hits, tanks, guns, sweat, helicopters, guns, dead extras, muscles, guns, explosions, blood and guns.  Which is, of course, incredibly good fun to watch.The story is fantastic in it's simplicity - nasty bad guy in charge of evil communist army is cruel to local rebels so good old Sly has to penetrate converted mountain base, rescue his friend and destroy the entire opposing army.  Marvellous.  The ultimate action-adventure that could be written by an excited 5 year-old.This could have been incredibly boring given the horrendous script and there are times when it is in danger of becoming like one of the billions of B-movie action films that grace the bottom shelf of video shops these days, but Stallone's hyper-macho performance and Peter MacDonald's direction keep things lively.
