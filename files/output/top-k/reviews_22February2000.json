He's a tortured soul as well as a torturing one. Teresa Wright matches Cotten every step of the way, as a good girl who never falls into the stilted ingenue trap of the period. That confrontation at the back steps near the conclusion is a classic cinematic confrontation, and the menace is all hers (Go away or I'll kill you myself...that's how I feel...)The supporting players are uniformly fine, especially Patricia Collinge as snookered sister Emma and Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn as the comic-relief pair (the latter two do a lot to liven up some duller patches in the second half.) I may be the only one who feels this way, but I love Janet Shaw as that poor waitress Louise, the kind of person Charlie might have become if her uncle had his way. (I've been in half the restaurants in town...Yes sir, for a ring like that I'd just about die.)The most interesting thing about Shadow of a Doubt is the marriage of two great artistic visions, Hitchcock's belief in the core evil of humankind and Thornton Wilder's sunnier but no less complex focus on how society, informed with some sense of spiritual responsibility, can shape man for the better. There's a duality here that is presented to us in varying ways throughout the film, most successfully with the two lead characters, twins who live on opposite ends of a wide moral chasm.I just wish this film moved a bit faster and that the characters weren't so marble-mouthed at times. I don't think this is MTV-era carping, it just feels slow for a Hitchcock film. Then again, compared to Our Town, this is a Will Smith video, so maybe that Hitchcock-Wilder duality has its downside. I give it an 8, not tops but I really enjoy it and think you will, too.

The anticipation was frenzied to the point that there was ridiculously long lines which stretched out the door and onto outside; you could actually feel and sense the anticipation in the air and throughout the crowd. I remember speculating whether or not the movie would be worth all the hype; as it turned out it was. Another point of note is that sadly in todays modern Hollywood, the spectacle of big release films is nothing like the days of yesteryear. Batman upon release back in 1989, still had it.The original and first Batman in my opinion is by far the best of the lot. The casting and plot comes off perfectly for a comic book to movie adaptation. Although subject to intense debate and scrutiny actor Michael Keaton I feel was made to play the Capped Crusader with his dark, lifeless eyes glaring through his Batmask. Keatons whole ambiance and conviction perfectly mimicked what one would've envisioned for the role of Batman. Jack Nicholson was also perfect as the Joker. It's hard for one to forget Nicholson's wicked grin and oddly sarcastic humor which perfectly portrayed the Joker to a tee. They both set a certain tone for this movie that somehow brought the comic book to life on screen. I remember when the movie began it felt as though you were in a different world when viewing Gotham City on the big screen. Gotham City's brilliant architecture was splendidly vivid and displayed an on point Gothic style. Even the inhabitants of the city down to the clothes they wore, were authentic and blended well. I mean the visual scenery was something I certainly noticed, and it came off as dark and eerie; just what one might expect for the Batman movie. I've noticed that the reviews of this movie throughout IMDb all use the adjective dark to describe the tone of the film and it's a justified acknowledgment. In transforming the comic book\/TV characters to the movie, Burton was able to pull casting off very well. Commissioner Gordon was just as you expected him to be from the comic and TV series, Vicki Vale plays a background role in the movie but seems to fit just right, and Alfred performs well as Bruce Waynes butler who has a special relationship with him stemming from childhood. Also we were all waiting to see the Batmobile or as the Joker would say the toys, those wonderful toys. The whole movie was filled with clever gadgetry and machinery. The Batmobile lived up to its billing as a sinister ride that shot flames of fire from the exhaust as it rocketed along the Gotham streets. The Bat cave was an intriguing and dark locale where Bruce Wayne was secretly transformed into the mysterious Batman. The smaller nuances are the things that make the first Batman memorable to me, like the scene where Vicki Vale wakes up in the middle of the night and sees Bruce Wayne hanging upside down from a pole like a bat, the scene where a bullet ricochets off of Batmans glove and wounds Jack Nappier, wickedly defacing him, ultimately transforming him into the wickedly grim faced Joker. The first scene of the movie where we see Batman for the first time and he lifts a disbelieving thief off his feet and tells him to alert his other crooked friends that I'm Batman. The fight and action scenes in the movie were also great and packed some suspense. Also take note of Burtons use of grand statues and mannequins throughout the movie, like the collection Bruce Wayne kept in his mansion which drew the admiration of Vicki Vale and newspaper reporter Knox. The various gargoyle statues that were on the buildings throughout Gotham City,these added to the effect and environment of the movie that helped draw the viewer into the comic book vibe. I feel the the first Batman was definitely a triumph for Tim Burton. The other films that followed the first Batman failed to continue on the true nature of Gotham City and its characters, although Batman Returns comes close. To me Batman stands the test of time as a well casted and directed film that brings the comic book to life. It certainly will always be one of my favorites.

I have never read a book which appeared so real. What was the most amazing was his style of writing. I could just picture Richard, someone in my age group with similar back ground and similar values, talking to me about his experience over a couple of beer. So I reckoned that it would be a really difficult book to turn into a book and do as well. And here it was. I was disappointed with the film. It was very half way. It followed the book for some of the plots, but changed quite a lot of things. The book had events developing, leading us to some place. The film had many random events which seemed to go nowhere. Like the shark attack. That changed a lot of things in the book. In the movie, that seemed to do very little. It would have made no difference to the film if that was there or not. And Richard's involvement with Sal and Francois. That seemed to do nothing as well. In the book, his infatuation with Francois was interesting because nothing developed. Once they become a couple, it had no impact on the film. The ending of the film was very Hollywood. Richard screaming out philosophy of the beach did nothing for me.

Benjamin is not portrayed as a rebel at all, he is a somewhat jerky guy who is at a (seemingly) monumental time in his life, where he should chart out the course of his life but has no idea of where he should be headed and no standard but his own emotions to guide him.Notice how after his affair with Mrs. Robinson begins, He suddenly feels no need to fight his fear of the future, and just lies around all day. To him, this affair seems to answer all his needs, and he is no longer motivated to try to do anything else except lie around and meet mrs. robinson in the evenings.I read reviews where the reviewer said when they first saw it, they cheered for benjamin's rebellious behavior. I don't get it. At no point in this movie did i want to cheer for benjamin, but i could sympathise with him.If you know nothing about the movie, you should know that it does not follow the formula of hero, heroine, conflict, resolution, happy ending (jurassic park, armageddon; romantic comedies; any old musical). In fact, there is no heroic character at all in this movie. BUT, at no point is tragedy forced into the story for drama's sake. the people all act like real people would, and the story is pretty straight-forward. If you liked movies like fargo, american beauty, or godfather 2, you shouldn't have any problem with this movie.It seems kind of dated to me for two reasons the simon & garfunkel soundtrack seems a little pretentious, lyrics-wise (hello darkness, my old friend) where music today seems to be a little less earnest, and the camera work is not as fluid as today's movies are.All that said, it is an entertaining story, which left me thinking not about affairs or careers or love or plastics, but about how we should make decisions.

It was kind of like watching a two hour sitcom but with a motion picture feel to it. There was an honest genuine feel to the humor and some of the best physical comedy I've seen in years but I'm still trying to figure out what the title of the movie has to do with it.        Whole Nine Yards is a dark comedy about mob double crosses and the search for marital bliss. Mathew Perry plays the character of Oz Oseransky, a dentist in the quiet suburbs of Montreal, Canada. He is stuck in an unhappy marriage with a wife that wants nothing to do with him except to give her money and pay off her father's debt. His life takes an interesting turn when a new neighbor moves in next door. He goes out to welcome his new neighbor and can't quite figure out why the man looks so familiar. It slowly dawns on him that the man, Jimmy the Tulip Tudeski (Bruce Willis), is a contract killer for a Chicago mob gang. Rumor has it that the Chicago mob is looking for Jimmy and Oz's wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), sees an opportunity to reap financial gains by convincing Oz to go to Chicago to tell the Mafia where Jimmy is. While in Chicago, Oz manages to fall in love with the wrong woman and it dramatically complicates his life. The story takes several wild turns after this point and leaves the audience guessing the ending.        There were many things I liked about this movie and a few things I didn't so which would you like to hear first? I'll start with the good things. The storyline is actually smartly written. As I alluded to earlier, the story takes several unexpected turns keeping the audience guessing although I'm sure, you can generally guess what the ending is going to be like. Bruce Willis is excellent as Jimmy Tudeski. Normally when you think of Bruce Willis, you think of action movies like the Die Hard series or Armageddon but he has stepped out of his action hero role for odd ball type movies like Death Becomes Her or Sixth Sense. Whole Nine Yards is another of these odd ball type movies and he does a wonderful job. Mathew Perry has tried to make the transition from TV star to movie star and has been in a few movies over the last couple years but this is by far his best performance. He has always had very good comedic timing but in this movie he got to show his physical comedy skills which impressed me more than anything. He played the paranoid hit victim very well and his chemistry with Willis was amazingly humorous. Michael Duncan also gets a chance to show his comedic skills and does a good job.        The one thing I really didn't like about this movie was Rosanna Arquette as Oz's wife, Sophie. She has never really been one of the more elite actors in the industry and she does nothing to raise her stock in this movie. I realize that her character was to be played a little over the top but her French accent is just plain terrible. At times, it sounded a little like a mix between a French and Asian accent. I found myself rather distracted trying to figure out what she was saying whenever she spoke. At other times I felt that she took her character a little bit too far over the top. The story itself did suffer from some incomplete plot telling. There were certain elements of the plot that were blatantly ignored and it tends to leave the audience wondering. There was one thing about Mathew Perry's performance that I did notice. For any of you who watch him on the TV sitcom series Friends, you may have noticed his TV character of Chandler Bing slipping out into Oz everyone in a while. I guess that is to be expected considering his character of Oz is somewhat similar to his TV character.        Overall, I enjoyed myself.

Pyramids, sand, big square rocks, dead languages ... there's also your usual Star Wars style technology, which is equally hard to dislike ... and then there's that creature.  It's cute.  You know the one I mean that gentle, extra-large buffalo thing with big horns.  If they'd made `Stargate' today, that thing would have been computer animated, and it wouldn't have been nearly so real or so adorable.Okay.  Just so you'll know that I'm AWARE how silly `Stargate' is, there's two comments I'd like to get off my chest before I start saying nice things(1)  I don't care how much Daniel knows about dead languages, he can't know what Egyptian speech sounded like - and in any event, it's been several THOUSAND years!  Take a Chinese scholar, give him a brief whiff of British speech from a thousand years before the Romans arrive, and then plonk him down in modern-day London.  Would he understand a single word spoken by anyone?  Of course not.(2)  Devlin and Emmerich have a strange idea of academic conferences - they must think that people go to them only to heckle.  Daniel never even got a chance to mention the whacko part of his theory; he was drowned out in a chorus of Pshaws almost before he drew his first breath.  I'm surprised the audience didn't consist of people with big white walrus moustaches, drinking port.Well, I can forgive a few things like this.  Lowering the linguistic barriers I can forgive as a plot device (that could, admittedly have been better handled), and ... well, the whole aliens-built-the-pyramids thing is absurd anyway, and Emmerich comes reasonably close to hitting the right tone to pull it off with some grace.

Go see it. But please don't make the ridiculous claim that it's better than the first one. The first one had the true spark of originality - this one is a mere updating, a scrupulous ploy to revisit all the good bits pioneered by its predecessor. Don't get me wrong - it does an exceedingly good job of this, and finds creative and imaginative ways to recycle the material without making the audience feel that it's just seeing the same old thing again (I particularly liked the way it worked in a *second* Buzz Lightyear action figure, so that we could have the fun all over again of a Buzz totally clueless as to his own doll-hood). But, really, when you get right down to it, we *are* seeing the same old thing again the characters haven't expanded or grown any (how can they, after all - they're TOYS!!) and the plot mechanism is exactly the same - a daring rescue mission to save a toy in trouble. And it suffers the same malady which infects every sequel, the desire to do everything bigger and more opulently, which undermines the low-key charm the original had; instead of staying within the parameters of the neighborhood and a back-yard world, TS2 takes its heroes, more improbably (and impersonally), through crowded city streets, local shopping malls, high-rise office buildings, and finally into the bowels of a large modern airport. All of this is done with wit and originality, but it seemed to contradict the fundamental premise of the first one, which is that any step outside of the bedroom is a dangerous and unlikely one for a toy to make.  What's more, the egregious Sarah McLachlan song in the middle of the movie is one of the most lachrymose bits of over-stated sentimentality ever seen in a Disney movie and almost made me want to bolt from the theater in disgust. The first movie had nothing so wildly embarrassing (the Randy Newman songs being utterly perfect).The moral quandary Woody faces here is interesting, but it's almost too big a theme to introduce into a story of this nature. I was left unconvinced that he would choose the road of built-in obsolescence, represented by going back to Andy, as opposed to the assured ever-lasting fame of being enshrined in the museum. I ended up feeling sorry for the Stinky Pete character, who was supposed to be the villain but in actuality made some pretty good, hard-to-refute points about the ephemeral nature of being a mere child's plaything. You might say I was thinking about this too hard, but the story premise is an intriguing one, and seems to invite more allegorical and philosophical speculation than it delivers; it pulls back in the end and reverts to its big adventure chase mechanics. It seems to me that the first Toy Story did not make this fundamental mistake of biting off more than it could chew; plot, theme, and action were all perfectly integrated in that movie, making it truly one of the minor classics of our age.Anyway - just needed to get that all off my chest. TS2 is an enjoyable movie, no question about it, one of the best of the year. But because of the absolute perfection of its predecessor, I just couldn't help feeling it was somewhat hollow and regurgitated.

In the whole movie, the Italian army is never seen to fight anyone.I would have appreciated a more adult movie, which accepted Italy's fascist past and let us all, Italians included, muse on how a people that have brought us the wonders of the Renaissance could also produce the nightmare of Nazism.

Horror\/Carpenter fans will form a huge percentage of the audience, fans of neither will not see it therefore won't get to vote.I was looking forward to seeing this film, as the tale of a man who loses his sanity and becomes mentally enmeshed in a work of fiction is a strong and original idea. When the film was first released I read a review that claimed the film had no bearing in reality. Rather a strange thing to say about a film that covers monsters, deities and insanity, but watching this movie you can see what he meant. None of the characters, even Sam Neill's lead, have any sense of depth or purpose. We never get to know or particularly like the characters, so we cannot empathise with any perils they may encounter. Maybe Neill lacks the necessary depth to pull off such a role - when I see him laughing maniacally I remember how much better Antony Perkins did it in Le Procès - but even strong actors, such as Charlton Heston (who plays a publishing manager with nothing to do, and not, unfortunately, someone who drops to his knees at the sight of the Statue of Liberty, damning everyone to Hell) fail to make this work.Music is important to set a tone in film. Musical snobbery is not an issue. The Ink Spots set off the Shawshank Redemption's pleasingly pedestrian pace, but here we have a psychological horror that is bookended by heavy metal. I have nothing against the genre, but it does not work for film, or at least this type of film.
