Greeting people like a royal dignitary and handing out goods to the poor (Oh you must meet them. I'm sure you'll like them. Of course they haven't got two pennies to rub together but that's because they're poor.) and then looking a little confused as one of his merry men punches said peasant in the face, Cleese's insane take on Hood would seem out of place in most movies. But not in Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits The story is at once complex and really very simple. Simple in so far as it is just a coming of age story. Complex because it involves time travel, fantastical elements and even the concept of Evil itself. In summary, the plot involves Kevin (Craig Warnock) entering a portal through time and space due to the fact that 6 dwarfs appear in his bedroom, and rather than face the big scary head that is chasing them, he decides to join them. The big scary head turns out to be that of the supreme being and the dwarfs turn out to be his assistants. They have taken a map showing all of the holes in the universe, and using this valuable artefact, have decided to make their fortune. Kevin, who frankly is ignored by his gadget-obsessed Mum and Dad, is happy to go along with the insanity, which leads him from Napoleonic Italy, to Ancient Greece, from Medieval England to the deck of the Titanic. Yet all of this fun comes at a cost. The group are tricked into going to 'The Time Of Legends' by Evil (David Warner), who wishes to steal the map and recreate the world in his own image a modern world, without useless things such as butterflies and daffodils. Luckily in the end all is set to right, apart from the fact that Kevin's parents are both killed in front of him in a horrific fashion and his home and almost everything he owns is burnt to a crisp. Still, mustn't grumble&#133; Considering that it is written by two former Pythons it is not surprising that this film is of both the zany and the funny ilk. It is also really rather dark, with a large number of brutal deaths occurring on screen, as well as some adult concepts. Just because it is a comedy fantasy, do not be fooled into thinking it is designed for children. While it has a PG rating I think that this movie is more enjoyable to people over the age of 12, simply because many of the ideas within the movie are intellectually abstract.At times watching this movie is much like watching one of Gilliam's animated interludes come to life. A giants foot coming down on a hut while we hear a couple bicker, the fantastic settings of Evil's lair, and even the slightly surreal home of Kevin and his parents, remind us of the slightly skewed vision of the director. However skewed it may be it is, ultimately, compelling viewing.Does it really happen or is it all in the mind of Kevin? Frankly there are arguments for both ideas. All of the places visited can be seen around Kevin's bedroom. From the obvious pictures of Napoleonic armies and the tank seen at the end of the movie to the less obvious Lego model that becomes Evil's domain. Also Kevin is clearly a child with great imagination and very little outlet, with two ghastly parents living in a shrink-wrapped sofa world. On the other hand, after all of his adventures are over and he has returned to normality, there are still photos of his adventures in his knapsack. So, who is to say if it was all a dream or not? Certainly not me. And, frankly, it doesn't matter either way.On a personal note this review has been a hard one for me to write so far. Not because I don't like this movie - I do - but because I don't actually know what to say about it.

However skewed it may be it is, ultimately, compelling viewing.Does it really happen or is it all in the mind of Kevin? Frankly there are arguments for both ideas. All of the places visited can be seen around Kevin's bedroom. From the obvious pictures of Napoleonic armies and the tank seen at the end of the movie to the less obvious Lego model that becomes Evil's domain. Also Kevin is clearly a child with great imagination and very little outlet, with two ghastly parents living in a shrink-wrapped sofa world. On the other hand, after all of his adventures are over and he has returned to normality, there are still photos of his adventures in his knapsack. So, who is to say if it was all a dream or not? Certainly not me. And, frankly, it doesn't matter either way.On a personal note this review has been a hard one for me to write so far. Not because I don't like this movie - I do - but because I don't actually know what to say about it. Like many movies of Gilliam's it is the visual splendour that leaves its mark and there are really only so many times I can say that things do really look rather splendid.

That was the famous James Dean, here in his first of three starring roles before death took him at a tragically young age. Just as impressive, however, is the overall performance of the rest of the cast, including lesser-known Richard Davalos, who also was making his movie debut.The most impressive person connected to this movie, however, was director Elia Kazan who not only excelled directing this film but - in the same year - directed On The Waterfront. Now, that's not a bad year of work! East Of Eden is billed as a modern-day story of Cain and Abel, between good and bad brothers with one of them feeling rejected by his father. The small Biblical account of the two brothers only mentions an offering they both gave God and then saying the brother whose offering wasn't accepted went out in a fit of jealousy and killed the other. True, the offering by Cal (Dean) and its rejection by his dad Adam (Raymond Massey) leads to a climactic scene near the end of the film, but - this is just an assumption - most people viewed this simply as a story between good and evil pertaining to Dean and Davalos' characters.I didn't see either of those guys as either the good or bad brothers. In fact, this film story is unusual in that every main character's personality begins in one direction and, as the film progresses, ends in almost the opposite. Nobody is as they first seem.Cale Trask is shown early on to be a totally rebellious and immature loser who commits a few stupid acts of vandalism and has a desire to be a loner. As the film goes on, we see a softhearted guy who needs and desires love and companionship like everyone else. The fact he only had one parent, and that one didn't seem to love him, has messed his mind up a great deal.Meanwhile, his older brother Aron (Davalos) is pictured as the kind, dependable, levelheaded guy who has a nice sweetheart who he plans to marry very soon. Aron has always made his dad proud which makes Cale jealous and bitter (hence, the Cain\/Abel analogy.) In the last third of the film, however, Aron's personality reveals some dark, selfish traits and he isn't so good anymore.Julie Harris plays Abra, who begins as a sweet, likable and trustworthy person but in the end proves insincere in her ready to marry and I'm in love with Aron remarks as her feelings develop for the younger brother. She does a nice job at the end, however, helping Cale reconcile with his ailing dad.The fourth major player, the father of the two boys, is portrayed - at least by Cale - as man who has played favorites with his sons and is more of a businessman than a loving father. However, we see later that he is not a bad guy at all. He is happy to praise his younger son when merited, is quick to forgive but, like a lot of fathers in the old days, I believe, had a hard time outwardly expressing love for his children despite, in his heart wanting the best for them.The fifth major character in the film, Kate, has the least amount of lines but is the most powerful figure in the movie. She's the mother who abandoned her kids when they were babies and left her husband because she didn't want to be tied down to a ranch. Wow, Thank God our mothers didn't have that selfish attitude! She's pictured as a very hard, bitter woman who has made a success of herself and to hell with everyone else. However, once again, as the story unfolds, we see an opposite side. Cale, checking rumors she was in the area, sought her out and discovered she, indeed, was his mom. (Nobody in the Trask family knew she lived nearby, with the dad telling the kids she was dead rather than risk hurting their feelings.). Anyway, later she surprises us by softening up and loaning Cal $5,000 for a business venture to help him and help bail out his dad. That amount of money is equal to at least $100,000 today, so it's a generous, kind person who would say okay to that monetary request. The more she speaks, the softer she sounds, even if she wouldn't want to admit it.The only character I wish had a bigger role was Anne, played by Lois Smith, who was beautiful and had an intriguing role that I thought would amount to more. I'm glad to see that she is still acting on a regular basis today.Overall, it's a solid drama with complex characters who make you reflect about them long after you view this. I don't know why it took so long for me to finally see this movie, but I was impressed. (May I recommend the two-disc, special-edition DVD?). This movie is wonderfully directed, acted and photographed. I've only seen it once (last night) and I am not in love with the film (yet), but I am surprised it only garnered one Academy Award.

They quite happily agreed to put it on after I told them it was funny and had swearing in it. But soon, boredom started to sink in with the class. Crap, they labelled it. Boring, they yelled. After less than ten minutes, my teacher was changing the disk to, wait for it&#x85; 'The Others'. One of my chums, being a fan of the film, dismissed them as idiots. However, I told him it was all a matter of taste and that they would be much happier settling down to watch their 40-year-old virgins and American pies than this more subtly-coloured tin of paint. So as I walked over to the front of the classroom, tail between my legs, to pick up my DVD my teacher leaned over and said, Don't worry, I liked it. You have to be cultured to enjoy this sort of thing. And you know what, she's right.To be quite frank, 'Spinal Tap' is just like marmite. You'll either love everything about it or hate every frame of it. Some people say it's like watching wet paint dry, others say it was so funny it gave them a hernia. I definitely fall into that latter category. After the umpteenth viewing, I still find it painfully hilarious!But that's not the only reason for seeing it. It's also a totally accurate, observational and witty deconstruction of rock's strutting pretensions. If you're someone who thinks rock bands take themselves far too seriously, you need this movie. If, on the other hand, you feel like rock stars should forever be treated like gods and worshipped on a regular basis, you might just want to avoid this. After all, when Aerosmith's Steven Tyler had finished watching it he said he just felt like he wanted to throw himself off a cliff! It reveals the utter shallowness of rock 'n' roll without even flinching!If you're also a lover of in-your-face laugh-out-loud got-it-straight-away humour, just stay away. Far, far away. This is intellectual stuff. You have to possess intelligence to enjoy it. I've never met any stupid people who did enjoy this film. Director Rob Reiner really shows how broad his range is with this (his best in my opinion!), bringing every authentic detail, no matter how seemingly minor, to the screen effortlessly with a wonderfully sharp cast. Its still a challenge to get my head around the fact that this is from the same tubby Santa Claus look-alike who made 'The Princess Bride' and 'Stand By Me'! Reiner has always been a man with extraordinarily wide horizons and always will be, constantly entertaining cinema-goers with so many different stories!The film's fly-on-the-wall mockumentary style works wonders, getting some beautiful performances from its actors (namely Michael McKean and Christopher Guest) and adding to its 'natural' feel. Many films, mainly British ones, have imitated this style ever since. Even one of the film's actors and co-writers has stuck to the hip of this film for the most part of his career, coming up with new and even more outlandish 'mockumentaries' to entertain and sate his legion of followers. On each viewing, you'll erupt into laughter at the discovery of a new joke. Then for weeks on end, you'll be quoting it to your friends and everyone you know. It's like a treasure trove without a bottom!To finish this not-so-critical analysis, I can never find any fault or flaw even after the innumerable viewings I've had. I never get bored of it either. I think the reason I like this so much is, honestly, because it was made for people like me!

It's also a totally accurate, observational and witty deconstruction of rock's strutting pretensions. If you're someone who thinks rock bands take themselves far too seriously, you need this movie. If, on the other hand, you feel like rock stars should forever be treated like gods and worshipped on a regular basis, you might just want to avoid this.

This is intellectual stuff. You have to possess intelligence to enjoy it. I've never met any stupid people who did enjoy this film. Director Rob Reiner really shows how broad his range is with this (his best in my opinion!), bringing every authentic detail, no matter how seemingly minor, to the screen effortlessly with a wonderfully sharp cast. Its still a challenge to get my head around the fact that this is from the same tubby Santa Claus look-alike who made 'The Princess Bride' and 'Stand By Me'! Reiner has always been a man with extraordinarily wide horizons and always will be, constantly entertaining cinema-goers with so many different stories!The film's fly-on-the-wall mockumentary style works wonders, getting some beautiful performances from its actors (namely Michael McKean and Christopher Guest) and adding to its 'natural' feel. Many films, mainly British ones, have imitated this style ever since. Even one of the film's actors and co-writers has stuck to the hip of this film for the most part of his career, coming up with new and even more outlandish 'mockumentaries' to entertain and sate his legion of followers. On each viewing, you'll erupt into laughter at the discovery of a new joke. Then for weeks on end, you'll be quoting it to your friends and everyone you know. It's like a treasure trove without a bottom!To finish this not-so-critical analysis, I can never find any fault or flaw even after the innumerable viewings I've had. I never get bored of it either.

Knowing that these pop culturists wouldn't be too happy to watch one of my 'arty cult films', I didn't give a shite and brought in 'This is Spinal Tap'. They quite happily agreed to put it on after I told them it was funny and had swearing in it. But soon, boredom started to sink in with the class. Crap, they labelled it. Boring, they yelled. After less than ten minutes, my teacher was changing the disk to, wait for it&#x85; 'The Others'. One of my chums, being a fan of the film, dismissed them as idiots. However, I told him it was all a matter of taste and that they would be much happier settling down to watch their 40-year-old virgins and American pies than this more subtly-coloured tin of paint. So as I walked over to the front of the classroom, tail between my legs, to pick up my DVD my teacher leaned over and said, Don't worry, I liked it. You have to be cultured to enjoy this sort of thing. And you know what, she's right.To be quite frank, 'Spinal Tap' is just like marmite. You'll either love everything about it or hate every frame of it. Some people say it's like watching wet paint dry, others say it was so funny it gave them a hernia.

First, a review posted in the IMDb on September 15, 2006 makes reference to too much nudity in the film on the part of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, yet there was no nudity in the film. That, in itself, baffles me... but I digress. The second is why the scene where the Deputy is crucified like a butterfly. Realistically, where would Lecter have had the time, and being that the deputy was a large man, where did Hopkins summon the strength? OK, with those two issues aside, The Silence of the Lambs is a good film. I think it was deserved of Best Picture for that year, 1991, as well considering its competition. I don't think it was a great movie, however.I don't usually compare films with their novel counterparts, because films and books are really two separate beasts. Sometimes, such as with The Lord of the Rings trilogy, I make exceptions, but that is more the exception than the norm. Because I have seen many reference made to The Silence of the Lambs the movie versus The Silence of the Lambs the book, I feel compelled to comment. I read the book and I found the book to be very shallow. The film was far better. And that is all I have to say about that.Silence worked primarily because of Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) and Ted Levine (Jame Gumb.) Jodie Foster did an above average job as Clarice Starling, but there is just something about Foster that rubs me the wrong way in the film. I can't quite place my finger on it, maybe her attempt at a southern accent or maybe her masculine mannerisms and boyish looks, but she just didn't do it for me. As I have stated in my review of the film Hannibal, I found Julianne Moore to be far better suited for the part of Clarice Starling. Perhaps it is mere preference, and that is all.As I initially mentioned, there were some mechanical problems with the film. Overall, the film worked, though. It is a very dark and disturbing tale, and the atmosphere stays quite faithful to that premise with it's dark color tones and macabre soundtrack. There are few characters that earn the eerie and sinister reputation of Hannibal (the Cannibal) Lecter, and as already stated, this is a credit to Hopkins. The film's conclusion is both suspenseful and darkly comical. Some find themselves frustrated by the open-ended ending, but I found it perfect, especially how it made for an easy transition into the sequel.

Anyone thinking American Perfekt? Well what we have here is a bit more special than even that great movie.Here we have a gentle blond-haired murderer whose weapon of choice is a poisoned flask of amaretto (what better way to die?). He's so nice that when he sees an upturned rubbish bin at a lay-by on the highway he rights it and puts the rubbish back in. Because of his sweet character we are left to wonder at the motive for his murders, and it is not contradictory as some have suggested. Vann really believes he's being charitable.The first good deed of Vann we see is him putting a hardup depressed junkie out of her misery quietly and calmly, without pain. 'Well done' we're led to think for correcting this error, for subtracting this subtraction, for this analgesic act. This complicity leads us into unease as his next victim is the local football star, who, we are told can get into any college he wants to and is all set on joining the FBI afterwards. Zounds! Eftsoon we are lead to wonder what sort of life we are leading. Where even success is failure in the mental calculus of Vann Siegert. Indeed what fool would suspect that football+college+fbi=happiness? Perhaps some of you gin veterans, some of you workaday grunts (and I am one too - sigh) are nodding in agreement? This killer seems less of a Satan and more of an Evening Star.

His message to live life with never a sting.It will take giant nerves from you raving teens to carry on sympathising after he murders a stressed working man after an incredibly brief encounter at a diner. He seems to become more reckless as the movie carries on. It has been suggested that Vann Siegert 'is merely a reflection of what those who encounter him want him to be'. Indeed when Vann takes a room with Doug and Jane (Brian Cox and Mercedes Ruehl) he quite creepily takes over the role of their absent daughter whom they pine for. And whilst certainly most of us have the so-called Freudian death-wish it would certainly be a stretch to suggest that Vann is acting with any sort of moral authority in fulfilling it for us. Common sense suggests that if you found out someone you knew had murdered the local football hero, to save him having to suffer his perfect life, you would give them a damned good kicking. 'The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions' is the tagline from American Perfekt but would serve well for this movie. It's quite an unnerving film because of how submissive Owen Wilson's portrayal of this character is. Something we're not used to seeing on screen. Brian Cox's masochistic portrayal of Doug is also unsettling.Have yourself an arts evening, The Minus Man will keep you discussing sophomoric philosophy long in to the night, as the theatrical trailer promised.

Al Pacino is brilliant, if a little predictable, while Robert Duvall steals the spotlight if you ask me, with a truly masterful performance.The final scene will always be remembered, and for good reason, its artistically genius, but I won'y give it away.This film isn't for everyone, so don't worry if you think you oughta enjoy it just because it's ranked number 1 in the top 250. Just remember that films are always about opinion, and there can never be justifiable official Greatest Movie, so if you don't like it fine, don't let other people hound you down just because they insist that it's the perfect film, because as far as I'm concerned, there can never be a perfect film.As Peter Griffin once said, It insists upon itself Louis.

It's virtual reality taken to a whole other level.eXistenZ is an highly original movie that is well directed and acted out but above all very well written. The movie features a fascination and well thought out concept, which gets greatly executed by director David Cronenberg.eXistenZ is a movie that knows to constantly fool you. Just when you thought you figured things out, another surprise awaits around the corner. Things are never like how you think they are, especially when the line between truth and fiction gets explored. You just never really know what is the reality and what is the game-world, right till the ending. It makes the characters and events all very unpredictable and also provides the movie with a great ending that will leave you thinking even more.The movie has a perfect kind of game-play storytelling, mostly with its character appearances and its puzzling events. They have to complete a certain step or task first before they can continue in the world and find out what their purpose in the game is.The movie knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and surrealism, without ever going over-the-top with either one. The storytelling keeps the movie as simple as possible, though of course the movie isn't always that simple to follow because of its events, dialogs and unusual environments.The movie is not only just weird though. I was actually surprised to see that Videodrome has an higher rating on here, thought it's a far more inaccessible and 'odd' movie. The movie is also still made entertaining and has a good fast pace. It doesn't ever allow the movie to get stuck in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings. It also makes this movie perfectly watchable for people who normally don't watch this sort of movies.The movie is good looking, with subtle effective special effects a great visual look, that also provides the movie with a certain required 'gaming' feeling.The movie is well cast, with Jude Law in a role you don't too often see him in, that of a shy insecure person.

The Trouble With Harry will at first glance appear to be Hitchcock kind of taking a break from serious films, the thrillers and suspense films that he is best known for, and relaxing a bit with a light comedy, but there is much more going on in this film than that. First of all, only Hitchcock would come out with something that could be termed a light comedy when the central figure in the film from beginning to end is a dead body, but a lot of Hitchcock's standard themes are very prevalent in the film, even though it differs so much from his traditional style.First and foremost, of course, is Hitch's real life, almost crippling fear of the police, whom he portrays so often in films as bumbling, incompetent blockheads. The film is almost entirely dialogue driven, the crisp exchanges are almost nonstop from beginning to end and never get boring. Shirley MacLaine makes a brilliant film debut as Harry's new widow, displaying the perfect amount of charm and sweetness that allows us to immediately forgive her gladness at her husband's sudden death, no matter how mysterious or how many times the supposed responsibility for his death changes hands.As the blame is circulated among the diverse and likable group of main characters, the procession of guilt and responsibility leads to Harry being dug up and re-buried several times, until Jennifer (MacLaine) is asked what she thinks they should do, to which she replies, I don't care what you do with his so long as you don't bring him back to life. There is a recurring set device of a closet that just won't stay closed which seems to have caused some confusion as to its meaning, and I have a feeling that, since there is never anything actually hidden in it, it is a metaphorical thing that points to one of the underlying themes of the film, that of guilt. Skeletons in the closet, that kind of thing. Purely speculation, of course, but it makes sense to me.John Forsythe gives a brilliant, perfectly cool and laid back performance as the hugely likable Sam Marlowe, and his exchanges with Arnie, played by Jerry Mathers in his pre-Beaver days, are some of the best moments in the film, and this is also the first of a great many tremendously successful collaborations between Hitchcock and composer Bernard Herrman. Also keep your eye out for Hitch's cameo, which goes by much quicker than usual, you can miss it in a split second.

The Trouble With Harry will at first glance appear to be Hitchcock kind of taking a break from serious films, the thrillers and suspense films that he is best known for, and relaxing a bit with a light comedy, but there is much more going on in this film than that. First of all, only Hitchcock would come out with something that could be termed a light comedy when the central figure in the film from beginning to end is a dead body, but a lot of Hitchcock's standard themes are very prevalent in the film, even though it differs so much from his traditional style.First and foremost, of course, is Hitch's real life, almost crippling fear of the police, whom he portrays so often in films as bumbling, incompetent blockheads. The film is almost entirely dialogue driven, the crisp exchanges are almost nonstop from beginning to end and never get boring. Shirley MacLaine makes a brilliant film debut as Harry's new widow, displaying the perfect amount of charm and sweetness that allows us to immediately forgive her gladness at her husband's sudden death, no matter how mysterious or how many times the supposed responsibility for his death changes hands.As the blame is circulated among the diverse and likable group of main characters, the procession of guilt and responsibility leads to Harry being dug up and re-buried several times, until Jennifer (MacLaine) is asked what she thinks they should do, to which she replies, I don't care what you do with his so long as you don't bring him back to life. There is a recurring set device of a closet that just won't stay closed which seems to have caused some confusion as to its meaning, and I have a feeling that, since there is never anything actually hidden in it, it is a metaphorical thing that points to one of the underlying themes of the film, that of guilt.

Well, the plot doesn't really matter. HALLOWEEN is one of the few films where lack of plot isn't a hindrance; in-fact it's the complete opposite- it's one of its strengths. Carpenter's film is a lean mean shock machine that soars precisely because he jettisoned needless exposition. What's left is the very bare bones of a story. A six year old boy stabs his sister to death and, fifteen years later, on the anniversary of her murder- Halloween, he escapes and returns to his home town to carry on an apparently motiveless killing spree. That's it.Directed by John Carpenter who've made brill cult movies The Thing and Assault On Precinct 13, has done a stupendous job with this movie and this definitely his best yet.It's the characters who make this movie work, and are completely believable from Jamie Lee Curtis's portrayal as the geeky virginal final girl Laurie Strode, bubbly airhead Lynda (PJ Soles), and the sarcastic but amiable Annie (Nancy Loomis), who all become the focus of Michael Myers murderous intentions. Donald Pleasance's portrayal of the brilliantly unhinged Dr Loomis, Myer's doctorThe only other adult inhabitants of Haddonfield of any note are Lynda's boyfriend Bob (John Michael Graham) and Annie's Father- Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers), who both seem curiously disposable. However, on a night that has been relegated to providing entertainment for children, paradoxically it is the two kids that Laurie Strode ends up baby-sitting- Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews) and Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards), that are the first residents of the sleepy town to recognise the true nature of the night- and the terrifying reality of the Boogey Man.It is a pity that none of the other sequels were as great as this one, even though Halloween 2 get's slagged off a lot, it's still enjoyable but doesn't have the likable characters this one has.It's easy to see why this was a massive hit and spawned 7 sequels and this movie remains cherished It's incredible that it can still seem so vibrant and engaging- it's ability to grab the viewer and scare them shitless is resolutely undiminished. None of the films that followed in its wake are as effective , and with boogey men (and women) of their own) are as good- but then again, how could they possibly top near perfect film making?

A sex-crime story of middle-America's dark underbelly. A garish detective story. Or was it all a young man's dream? David Lynch's iconic 80's movie is all of these and more. Film students pore over whether it is a modern fairytale or an Oedipal voyage through perversity.College boy Jeff finds a severed human ear on waste ground and takes it to his dad's friend, Detective Williams. Filled with boyish adventure and amorous longing for Williams' daughter, Sandy, Jeff concocts a daring plan with her to spy on a strange woman, Dorothy Vallens, who is perhaps implicated in something dodgy. It turns out Dorothy is being blackmailed by a shockingly malevolent and vicious criminal called Frank &#150; who gets high before committing his most gruesome acts.You don't want to know Frank. He's the stuff of nightmares. Sandy is apple-pie goodness and Dorothy is more a come-to-my-bedroom, do-you-want-to-do-bad-things type-of-girl. But before Jeff can say Sacher Masoch or think up novel uses for soft fluffy fabrics, the semi-impotent Frank is happy to initiate him &#150; at knifepoint down at Pussy Heaven bordello.Dorothy sings at the local Go Slow nightclub. It's respectable enough, but hardly the place you'd think to find clean-cut kids like Jeff and Sandy. Not to mention her manically jealous boyfriend, Mike. And if the sight of a naked, half-crazed Isabella Rossellini on Jeff's front lawn is going to disturb you, please don't go and see this movie. (As inspiration for this scene, Rossellini, who plays Dorothy, says she used the famous photo by Nick Ut of the Vietnam girl walking naked after a napalm-bomb attack.)Blue Velvet is controversial stuff. Not just for scenes of sexual violence (including non-consensual ones) but because tension between polar opposites is at the heart of the film. Long before American Beauty, Blue Velvet strips the veneer off the popular image of the USA. Sandy's pristine (but sterile) American-dream world contrasts poignantly with the more lurid, adults-only side of America symbolised by Dorothy, who is struggling to regain &#150; if not exactly innocence &#150; a safe and happy medium.A number of of the themes and motifs seem deliberate &#150; such as Jeff's tormented sexual awakening &#150; he's faced with either a girl who 'doesn't give out' on one hand or a dangerous vamp on the other. Some however are natural echoes of the psychology reflected in folklore (such as when innocent youngsters enter a dark wood).Blatantly 'inappropriate' music repeatedly evokes emotional outrage in us on behalf of victims. Roy Orbison's ballad, 'In Dreams', plays as we watch a vicious beating. 'Blue Velvet' is Frank's favourite song and, in the film, connected with rape. 'Love Letters' are code for bullets. The effect is unsettling, a bit like the use of the song 'Singing in the Rain' in A Clockwork Orange. The emotional dislocation is also the stuff cult movies are made of.References to other films abound. Dorothy suggests The Wizard of Oz, clad in red shoes but definitely no longer in Kansas. Sandy has the home-grown goodness of her namesake in the musical Grease. Jeff spying on Dorothy recalls the voyeuristic 'Jeff' from Rear Window. Many have found parallels with It's a Wonderful Life. But Blue Velvet transcends all these in its ability simultaneously to convey meaning on so many levels.In some of Lynch's later films, surreal flights into fantasy can be subtle and obligatory. But in Blue Velvet, the audience is left to decide. Speaking of the severed ear, Lynch said, It had to be an ear because it's an opening. An ear is wide and, as it narrows, you can go down into it. And it goes somewhere vast . . .New American Gothic? Shot on a very tight budget, Blue Velvet remains one of the most influential films of the 80's. It also includes the sort of quasi-mystical mystery-dialogue that would become a Lynch staple. I'm seeing something that was always hidden. . . . I'm in the middle of a mystery &#150; and it's all secret. The 'mystery' is also what eventually pulls Sandy out of her too-good-to-be-true cubby-hole in more ways than one You're a mystery. I like you &#150; very much, says Jeff. Then he snogs her face off. Where's my dream? she asks later (Jeff having just demolished it for her).Perhaps it is the eroticism that encapsulates the final contrast between what is known and what is not. Much of it, though undoubtedly powerful, is implied. For instance, when Dorothy's breasts are first exposed they are out of focus, whereas her bright red, sensuous lips are sharply in focus and become strongly emblematic of sexuality throughout the movie.
