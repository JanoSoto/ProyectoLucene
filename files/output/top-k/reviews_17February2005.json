In a way I'm glad I didn't see it then &#150; I surely would have embarrassed myself, because it would not have occurred to me that I would need a half-box of Kleenex at the end! I finally watched the movie in my own living room when it came to HBO several years ago, but while I enjoyed the movie at the time, it did not leave me with the urgent desire to see it again. However, I did watch the movie again recently, and now for some unexplainable reason, I can't seem to get enough of it. I have the DVD, and it is the movie I most often reach for on a quiet evening of lousy television.Those who are expecting a faithful adaptation of the book will come away sorely disappointed, and if that is their measure of the movie, they will do best to avoid this one. However, those who love the characters, who don't mind seeing new adaptations and interesting plot twists, and who love rich costumes and set designs will find this movie wonderfully entertaining. And that is what it is all about, isn't it? Entertainment.I have read many reviews regarding this movie, and am puzzled, even dismayed at times, by some of the criticisms levied at various aspects of it. Some people have complained about the dialogue in the movie, calling it flowery, but truthfully I loved the fact that Randall Wallace did not modernize it. So many new films and TV series are dumbing down the dialogue of period pieces to make them more compatible with today's manner of speaking. I applaud Mr. Wallace for keeping the dialogue consistent with how it likely would have been spoken in the 17th century.Still others complained of the unlikelihood of all four Musketeers surviving a volley of musket fire during the final charge. If they had been watching properly, they would have noticed that the young Musketeers were turning their faces away, closing their eyes as they pulled the triggers. And after the first few shots, powder smoke begins to fill the corridor, obscuring their vision. So the lack of accuracy in their volley is adequately explained on more than one count. Moreover, if the critics had been watching more closely, they would have noticed that there are woundings -&#150; D'Artagnan is hit in the shoulder, Athos in the thigh. The other two are also limping, and the script confirms that all four are wounded in the barrage.As for the complaints that the four leads have four different accents, I did not find them distracting or annoying, as some have claimed. I expected it, since this is an International Cast, and with an International Cast, you get International accents.And speaking of the cast, I must say that in all the Musketeers movies I've seen, this is the strongest cast ever. The primary performers, Jeremy Irons, Gabriel Byrne, Gerard Depardieu, and John Malkovich, all turn in exquisite performances, and Leonardo DiCaprio is, in my opinion, convincing as Louis and Philippe, even though he is upstaged by the other four. Anne Parilloud is simply lovely as the Queen Mother, and the moments she shares with Byrne's D'Artagnan are some of the best in the film. The love scene between them, as brief as it was, is as beautiful as any I've ever seen (this coming from someone who is not a true fan of romance! I was left wanting more!). The music is brilliant and sets the mood perfectly for each scene. The wardrobe is exceptional, especially the black uniforms of the old musketeers.Particularly nice touches in this movie are the attention to detail The roses left for the queen speaks as decisively of D'Artagnan's love for her as words ever could (And yes, I really liked the plot twist involving the twins' paternity); Philippe dragging his masked head back and forth over the grating in frustration while in prison; the unmasking of Philippe in a dark blacksmith's forge, his hair wrapped around his neck where, as it grew, it was unable to escape the confines of the mask; Lieutenant Andre's devotion to D'Artagnan throughout the film and the way he looks away when the king orders the volley, unable to watch his captain cut down; the rich, fancy costumes contrast the torn, sweat-stained clothing where appropriate.The movie is not without its faults, though. The first scene involving Porthos and Aramis, for example, contains some crude language regarding parts of both the male and female anatomy and Porthos's flatulence, both of which seemed out of place, and actually got the film off to a shaky start. The first time I watched it, I almost turned it off at this point. Another reviewer here commented on the bulls-eye glimpses of Porthos' naked rear end, and I am inclined to agree with that reviewer! While I'm sure some of Depardieu's fans loved it, the scene did nothing to advance the plot, in my opinion, and was something I could have lived quite happily without ever having seen. There is hardly an actor or actress out there these days that has not done a nude, but quite frankly, some things are just better left to the imagination. I'm smiling as I write this, but truly, the scene was unnecessary. Thankfully, there is a skip button on my DVD player! And yes, I do use it.Those few faults are forgivable when surrounded by so many other details that are so elegantly done. For me, it was a very pleasing movie experience, one I enjoy over and over again. Kudos to everyone involved. Now, if I can just convince Randall Wallace to release a director's cut version . . . .

Once that is established, Craven does an excellent job of making normally comforting settings such as a soft bed or a warm bubble bath seem menacing. Never before has falling asleep seemed so scary, and it gets better and better as Nancy tries to come up with a solution before she goes crazy from lack of sleep, while surviving on coffee and caffeine pills. It has a very interesting suspense to it. There is also the nicely done part where they try to apply cold hard science to Nancy's problem (Something's wrong, the numbers are never this high!). Very cool.Those are the good parts. The bad parts are the lame acting (excluding Johnny Depp) and the laziness of the script. It really, really hurts this movie that so little attention is paid to the parents. They are barely even IN the movie, even though the entire premise revolves around them! The backstory about these seemingly nice parents, in a quiet suburban town, viciously killing a man (child murderer or not), and keeping it a big town secret, is a neat idea that is just briefly mentioned like an afterthought (Oh, by the way honey, all of us parents burned a man to death when you were a kid. Now go to bed, OK?). The implication is that Freddie is getting revenge on the people who killed him by murdering their innocent children, but it's not explained or developed at all. Why is he coming back NOW, for instance? Why not earlier? And why in the world do Nancy's parents completely ignore her? If you murdered a guy years ago, and then your kid, who knows nothing about it, provides an exact description of him in her dreams, wouldn't you think there was something a bit odd going on? It would have been much cooler if they had realized Freddie was killing their kids, and there's nothing they could do about it.I also hate the ending to this movie. Why do horror movies always have to have such bizarro endings? The climactic battle at the end is awesome, but then it takes such a weird turn--(and I'm not even including the nutty twist here, I'm talking about the father NOT CARING that his wife just got sucked into a bed by a demon!)--that it totally runs out of steam and turns into a horrible, nonsensical train wreck. Roll credits.If the movie focused more on the parents, and had a decent ending, it would have been a true classic. Instead, it is a mediocre slasher flick with a few interesting elements, which is a real shame.

Then, our heroes are stalked by an unkillable beast, which defies any explanation. All we know is that it can't be stopped and that it eats humans.I won't say anything about the ending, but I know that was the major reason the movie is not liked. Even I walked out of the theater, rather upset and hating the movie. I didn't watch it again until a year later, and it was mainly because I loved the cinematography.It was upon the second viewing that I realized what a brilliant film this is. It does everything that a horror movie is supposed to do. It takes twists that you don't expect. You have no idea how it's going to end.

As such, I wish to give another view, as well as an opposing view to the only one on here.Luhrmann may stay with the original dialog, but he plays fast and loose with the script. Anyone who has actually sat down and read the play as Shakespeare wrote it would know this. Example Opening scene. In this version the Capulets are the targets of the Montague's insults. In the real version, this is reversed. A minor yet significant example, since in the original the reader has a small sympathy for the Montagues who are apparently just minding their own business when these idiots harass them. The names of the families on the guns to represent their swords is just ludicrous, not to mention the duel between DiCaprio and Tybalt. And yes, DiCaprio wasn't popular when this film was made, but that doesn't mean he did a good job at acting his part. He didn't. Nor did Claire Danes.

No emotion, no passion, no reason to listen to them, 'Nuff said.And while we are on the subject of DiCaprio's reaction to Mercutio's death, why don't we talk about a little something known as Breaking the Tension, something that Luhrmann does better than anyone. During the famous scene where Romeo's best friend dies, we see perhaps the one and only time Leo shows true emotion to convey sorrow of losing his friend. Then we see the rage in his eyes as he swears revenge on his enemy. The pressure builds. We can feel the tension building up.Then out of the blue Danes is singing a song and laying on her bed, leaving us to wonder what the heck just happened.Do you see what has happened? We were all set, ready to see this dramatic scene unfold and climax, knowing its inevitable conclusion, we felt the blood rushing as we leaned forward on the edge of our seats, then we are smacked in the head with a sappy, lovely scene.Anyone who knows anything about filmography knows that this completely breaks the tension that was building up. That is bad. It is bad because now the audience feels like it has been removed from the action, like waking up from a dream suddenly. After doing that, it is impossible to get back into the movie. And sure enough, we see Mr. Leo with a fixed look of anger and determination. We see him take out a scared Tybalt. But you know what? We don't care anymore, because we're still miffed about a moment ago when Luhrmann decided to throw us for a loop. We can't engage the moment anymore because we're now between two opposite feelings One being the love Danes has for her Leo, and the hatred and anger Leo has for Tybalt. If Luhrmann had done this right, he would have had the entire scene with Romeo from the beginning to end (like Franco Zeffirelli did) and THEN put Danes bedroom scene in, AFTER the duel between protagonist and villain. This way, we would have felt the way Juliet does when she realizes something is wrong. We would have felt her world fall apart in front of her eyes when we were supposed to have done so After the fight with Tybalt winds down and Romeo's rage is calmed.And give me a break regarding the this movie is above criticism line.

I fell in love with it when I first saw it in the theatre at age 12 and I've never gotten over it. Even though I'm much older today, I maintain beyond personal nostalgic bias that WESTWORLD is a tight, brisk, intense, thrilling, totally satisfying 88 minutes of good fun.Somewhere in the near future, an enterprise called Delos has developed the ultimate vacation resort. For the cost of a mere $1,000 a day, adult guests may choose to live their fantasies out in one of three different environments Romanworld, Medievalworld, or Westworld. These resorts are each populated by very human-like robots who are programmed to serve every whim of the customer. State of the art computer technology ensures that everything's safe and that nothing can possibly go wrong.Richard Benjamin and James Brolin are two cowboy-wannabe friends who choose the 1880's Westworld for their unusual getaway. They make love to robot saloon women, participate in wild bar room brawls, and frequently get bullied around by a tough humanoid gunslinger dressed all in black (Yul Brynner, spoofing his look from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN), who is automatically obliged to get riddled up with bullets, repaired by technicians overnight as the guests sleep, and then shot up all over again for the next day.All is pure fun and games until something unidentifiable in the computer system begins to malfunction, and suddenly the world of Disney devolves into a place of horror. No longer taking orders to play dead, the robots are out to kill the guests, and the ominous gunslinger develops a frightening taste for the kill as he becomes an unstoppable walking menace, 10 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator ever hit the screens.Author Michael Crichton (THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN) wrote the screenplay and directed his first film with WESTWORLD, and it's an impressive debut in that he's able to keep the action moving along at a comfortable pace, using a small budget to its full advantage, and fashioning a real good-time movie experience that is at the same time both fun and foreboding. James Brolin and Richard Benjamin are completely likable in their parts, but it is Yul Brynner's multi-layered conception of the gunslinging robot who changes from willing court jester to deadly assassin that's the main draw.Also a major asset is Fred Karlin's versatile music score. Changing from standard period western piano to a violins and whistles shindig, and finally to a weird techno-western mechanical hybrid when moods start to change for the worst, this is a very engaging soundtrack.So why don't you make arrangements to take the Delos hovercraft to Medievalworld, Romanworld or Westworld?

I have noticed a few of our American reviewers noting the fact that they didn't get to see the film at the time of release due to this stateside black-balling, and have only just managed to catch it now on TCM. Well what can I say? America deserved it after the way they treated Charlie.Throughout this film, you see Chaplin making remarks about America being the land of freedom and democracy, all of which are made with his tongue pressed so firmly in his cheek you can almost see it bulging. His character, King Shadov, is presented before the house of Un-American Activities Committee as a suspected Commie, mirroring Charlies real life experiences in the states just a few short years earlier.If ever a film delivered the ultimate two-finger gesture and a final winning laugh then this was it. I certainly hope that any Americans who have seen this film are thoroughly ashamed of what their countryman did. America was, for once, fully deserving of any shame it felt. Comparisons to Hitler and the Jews were quite stark and obvious.I am not a communist, I do not have communist sympathy's, nor do I agree with communist theory or doctrine, but in a land that boasts freedom and liberty for all, people should have been able decide for themselves what their political beliefs were, and they should have been left alone to express and practise them without fear of persecution.In my opinion Senator Joe McCarthy and the rest of his gang of bullies were guilty of the most Un-American activities in the history of your great nation. It was a blight on your constitution.Charlie had, for nearly fifty years, lived amongst you, worked with you, entertained you and employed you, and this is how you repaid him. Shame.Right. Telling off and political wrangling over, I shall turn my attention to the film in question.Due to Chaplin's expulsion from the United States, this film was made in his homeland of England and features a mainly British cast trying to convince us that they are native New Yorkers which doesn't really seem to work. Why set the film in New York then? Why not have the European King finding asylum in Britain (everyone else seems to be doing it.) Call it the King of London or something.No this had to be set in America for Charlie's revenge to have worked. This is a political film which is designed to generate the feelings I have already outlined above...it is as much of a mockery as when he played the Great Dictator dancing with his blow-up globe, it is the same satire designed to show up the USA for the kind of place it had become and was becoming.There are moments in the film where Chaplin is practically miming and the tramp is once again on our screens and it is magic to behold..not half as gut funny as his early shorts were but he still has a lot of the old spark and at 68 he shows no less energy than he did back then either.There is also a nightclub act involving two characters who mime a wallpapering scene and I'll eat my hat if Chaplin hadn't worked that routine out himself before hand. It was Chaplin-esque in the extreme.He did have a great speaking voice, which makes it hard to believe he stayed silent on screen for so long and in this picture he treats us to Hamlet's soliloquy and does rather well methinks too...Olivier would have been proud.All in all not the best film for him to have bowed out on, but a film made on his terms, with his inner being projected on the screen.

I have noticed a few of our American reviewers noting the fact that they didn't get to see the film at the time of release due to this stateside black-balling, and have only just managed to catch it now on TCM. Well what can I say? America deserved it after the way they treated Charlie.Throughout this film, you see Chaplin making remarks about America being the land of freedom and democracy, all of which are made with his tongue pressed so firmly in his cheek you can almost see it bulging. His character, King Shadov, is presented before the house of Un-American Activities Committee as a suspected Commie, mirroring Charlies real life experiences in the states just a few short years earlier.If ever a film delivered the ultimate two-finger gesture and a final winning laugh then this was it. I certainly hope that any Americans who have seen this film are thoroughly ashamed of what their countryman did. America was, for once, fully deserving of any shame it felt. Comparisons to Hitler and the Jews were quite stark and obvious.I am not a communist, I do not have communist sympathy's, nor do I agree with communist theory or doctrine, but in a land that boasts freedom and liberty for all, people should have been able decide for themselves what their political beliefs were, and they should have been left alone to express and practise them without fear of persecution.In my opinion Senator Joe McCarthy and the rest of his gang of bullies were guilty of the most Un-American activities in the history of your great nation. It was a blight on your constitution.Charlie had, for nearly fifty years, lived amongst you, worked with you, entertained you and employed you, and this is how you repaid him. Shame.Right. Telling off and political wrangling over, I shall turn my attention to the film in question.Due to Chaplin's expulsion from the United States, this film was made in his homeland of England and features a mainly British cast trying to convince us that they are native New Yorkers which doesn't really seem to work. Why set the film in New York then? Why not have the European King finding asylum in Britain (everyone else seems to be doing it.) Call it the King of London or something.No this had to be set in America for Charlie's revenge to have worked. This is a political film which is designed to generate the feelings I have already outlined above...it is as much of a mockery as when he played the Great Dictator dancing with his blow-up globe, it is the same satire designed to show up the USA for the kind of place it had become and was becoming.There are moments in the film where Chaplin is practically miming and the tramp is once again on our screens and it is magic to behold..not half as gut funny as his early shorts were but he still has a lot of the old spark and at 68 he shows no less energy than he did back then either.There is also a nightclub act involving two characters who mime a wallpapering scene and I'll eat my hat if Chaplin hadn't worked that routine out himself before hand. It was Chaplin-esque in the extreme.He did have a great speaking voice, which makes it hard to believe he stayed silent on screen for so long and in this picture he treats us to Hamlet's soliloquy and does rather well methinks too...Olivier would have been proud.All in all not the best film for him to have bowed out on, but a film made on his terms, with his inner being projected on the screen.

That said, I did not care for this movie. It's not the subject matter or the subetext or the mode of presentation that got me; it was the cruel, moralistic, judgmental tone taken by the director. Dynamics between the characters were compellingly and interestingly explored the sisters' antagonism, and moreso the contrast of one brilliant scene in which they convince us all that they do love each other, the older sister's interaction with her parents, which was realistically one sided and antagonistic (she is a teenager after all). Even the wrenching scenes of her lover's manipulation of her were well-acted and occasionally subtle. Having to listen to her being sodomized, however, was unnecessary. It was the sort of shock technique that betrays a director's contempt of her audience We understand that his manipulation of her is evil beyond words, and we hate him enough. As the scene descends from the quiet politics of (basically) a man trying to rape an unexperienced, lovesick girl into a series of shrieks and abrupt grunts (all the while we stare into the uninterested face of the Fat Girl of the American title), it's not in-your-face realism, it's just bathos. Then there's the ending. The director spends an hour creating interesting character dynamics, a tense conflict between a young girl whose desires conflict with her own best interest but is too young to understand it, her sister who is forced to grow up under the influence of this person, and her mother who is confounded by the whole affair, and then decides to end it with a murderer with a hatchet. Yes, the scene is thematically resonant All the characters get exactly what they want. The older sister gets to die along with her mom, and the younger sister gets to lose her virginity to a man who means nothing to her. So that's what the movie is? The director saying Be careful what you wish for? Obviously, a director has an obligation to follow her or his muse; but that is no reason to revert to abject cruelty, both toward characters and the audience. Again, it's condescending We can see the moral issues at work in this situation, so why do we need a psychopath to reduce everything to an obvious moral absolute in the most unpleasant, brutal fashion possible? It's just annoying moralism on the director's part, punishing the characters for... something - while punishing the audience, apparently, for caring about the characters.

One of the sisters, the sympathetic and essentially good-hearted Agnes (Harriet Andersson in a gut-wrenching performance), is dying from an indeterminate cancer, and it is her slow journey towards death, its effect on her sisters and Anna the maid, and its aftermath that is the center of this story. Though why she, and not her sisters, should be afflicted, neither the movie nor Bergman can explain, and rings out as an injustice.The reason if, the other two sisters are variations of monstrous people who are successful Karin (Ingrid Thulin) is what seems to be an icy control freak, not a horrible woman, but close, who cannot stand human touch of any kind, and we're privy to her torment in a flashback where she uses a piece of a broken wine glass to literally mutilate her vagina, seemingly enjoying it (as she shocks her husband), while writhing in unspeakable pain. Maria (Liv Ullmann) shows less, is more of an enigma and a hard character to pinpoint, but she's equally manipulative if not flatly repulsive she not only tries to resume an affair with Agnes' doctor (who points out she her internal ugliness is starting to show through her facial expressions as she apparently enjoys this criticism) but she also fails to help her husband at a critical moment when he stabs himself in the stomach. Later on, both sisters (particularly Karin) verbally express their hatred for each other in a powerful montage that leads to a moment of equally intense reconciliation that comes without the use of dialogue and is emphasized by the swell of music (Chopin). Ingrid Thulin stands out, letting the gamut of Karin's sheer rage our out of her visage while suddenly changing back to a softer self, then to her steely image of self-control and back to fury in a snap of fingers.There's a lingering question throughout the movie there must have been some extreme trauma, some truly horrific event (or events), that must have set forth the deluge of pain that rips throughout the entire story right up until the end. Karin herself alludes to the tissue of lies that could mean anything possible sexual abuse by the unseen father, a complicity between Maria and her mother, and Agnes in the center, rejected. Although Karin does mention the revulsion she felt towards Maria, one can only wonder what it was that transpired which seems to have driven her into momentary lapses of insanity. In fact, her self-hatred mirrors Agnes' intense suffering rather closely, although both characters rarely interact and are on entirely different planes. In some ways, it wouldn't be out of place to say that Agnes, despite the unimaginable suffering she endures, serves as merely a catalyst, a materialization of the horror Karin herself has had to face. At least Agnes has experienced a form of love, if selfless, under the guise of Anna who comes to her aid, gives of her breast in an almost saint-like passion. Karin only has the cold future of her own dismal life to face. And Maria isn't even alive, but sadistically observing.Aside from PERSONA this has to be one of Ingmar Bergman's most powerful works, one that hits an audience at a gut level (cliched as though it may sound). The dominant color red only adds tension to the already tense scenes between the quartet of women (and the men, who only make pat but indelible appearances). Woody Allen would use these stylizations of the face looking dead at the camera, telling a story of its own in INTERIORS, another looks at three sisters, neither of them sympathetic.

Watching it tonight, for the first time in a decade, it seems a little clunky, desperately contrived, utterly tasteless and, well, incredibly 1980s.The 1980s had a really unpleasant sterile Nietzchian undercurrent bubbling through them, and this film is a product of that. The Christian Slater character, with his Jack Nicholson voice and Peter Falk posture, spouts inconclusive Reader's Digest\/Mein Kampf aphorisms as if they seal the argument and then kills people. The satire rests upon the adults all being idiots and the children all being competitive vampiric brutes, except for the former best friend and the ostracised victim of body fascism, who wait around to prove that Winona Ryder's character has a soul by being implausibly forgiving to her.The script's clumsiness even leads it into the same homophobia which it wants to satirise. It really is a poor effort.So why did it look so cool when it was new?

Complementing, or perhaps abetting Moore is Christopher Lee as Scaramanga, the eponymous million-dollar-a-hit hit man, who in turn is assisted by Herve Villachaize (this is all getting rather a bit too much now)as the thoroughly dis likable Nick Nack. Eye candy is provided by ex-supermodel Maud Adams and Britt Ekland, both of whom are gorgeous to look at but prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that neither one can act. The plot, what there is of it, seems to center around something called a Solex Agitator, a palm sized thingamajig that somehow miraculously makes the widespread use of solar energy a practical proposition. As for the titular gun, this is unquestionably the clunkiest, least-convincing looking prop yet seen in ANY Bond film. Ever. Even Scaramanga's wildly improbable flying AMC Javelin (actually a scale RC model) was far more interesting even though it's time on camera was very short; the gun, on the other hand, is regularly and tediously displayed time after time, looking for all the world like a Lego toy that's been spraypainted gold.As if all this wasn't bad enough, we're treated to a return appearance of J.W.Pepper, the redneck sheriff who first appeared in Live and Let Die (itself a dog of a Bond film), who, um, dogs (sorry) Bond periodically throughout this picture, most notably during the by-now obligatory spectacular car chase. Indeed, as spectacular as the 360 degree roll performed by the stunt car was, even this scene misfires through the use of a cartoonish sound effect.The Man with the Golden Gun remains, as of this writing, one of the poorest grossing Bond films yet made, and one look at the finished product will tell anyone why. Not that this is the fault of either Moore or Lee any actor, no matter how good, can only do so much with a weak script. Just ask Max von Sydow after he made Flash Gordon.
