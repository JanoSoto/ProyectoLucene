[{"date":"26 November 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Galaxy Quest is an affectionate and successful Star Trek spoof. Well I say spoof but that's probably not the most accurate term as the film never really parodies the series. It's more about the making of the show itself. The focus is on a group of washed-up actors whose livelihoods have come to depend on a popular science fiction TV series they made in the 80's. Its parallels with Star Trek are obvious. The clever thing that the film does though is to combine this with a narrative that manages to put these actors in the exact same position that their TV characters would be in week in week out, i.e. battling evil aliens in outer-space. So the film works equally as a comedy about the making of the show, while simultaneously functioning as an action adventure just like it.The plot centres on a group of aliens who believe that the Galaxy Quest transmissions are factually based. They travel to Earth and meet the ship's captain at a sci-fi convention. This eventually results in all of the crew ending up being taken to the far off galaxy to help save these benign aliens from aggressive adversaries.It's a clever touch having the aliens being mistaken for over-enthusiastic fans of the show. It acts as a good link into the second part of the film. I can't say I am a Trekkie, yet I enjoyed and 'got' this movie. Even non paid up members of Star Trek have a reasonable handle on what it was about and recognize some of the clichés of the show, so most of the specific references to it shouldn't really be over too many people's heads. Pleasingly, a lot of the jokes are very funny, hitting just the right note. The film doesn't go over the top with the humour. While the cast all acquit themselves very well, creating rounded characters that you can believe in. It's a film that should appeal to a wide range of people; they just might not realize it.
