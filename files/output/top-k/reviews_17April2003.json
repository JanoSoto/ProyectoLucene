I´ve always been to all kinds of weird creatures (I study biology and I love snakes, lizards, spiders...) and that´s why I found this little movie exciting. Whether all that could possibly happen wasn´t important at all, I was a kid! I´d sure love to see the good old Arachnophobia again, just to see if it´s still enjoyable. In the meantime I decided to check a movie called Eight-Legged Freaks which couldn´t be titled Arac Attack because the word Arac reminds every American of Iraq... That´s just so stupid, but back to my review...Eight-Legged Freaks was a very mediocre movie. It´s not a movie that´ll be remembered because it has nothing it could be remembered for. Sure, those spiders look nice (I guess they´re supposed to look a little fake), but they are neither scary nor funny and I suppose they were meant to be both. Those tiny killer spiders in that good old Arachnophobia were a lot scarier because they were more realistic.Eight-Legged Freaks lacks a real momentum and it runs out of steam after one hour. The plot is as simple as it could possibly be and you couldn´t care less about the characters. Since this is a part-comedy the characters are meant to be funny, but compared to John Goodman´s exterminator in that older spider movie I´ve mentioned so many times they don´t come even close to being funny. There are some amusing moments, but after sometime all that trying becomes very tiresome. I won´t say anything about the cast because there really isn´t anything to say.If you want to see this movie turn your brain off for 90 minutes and try to enjoy the ride.

Arnie hasn´t done a really good movie since 1996´s Eraser. Jingle All The Way was simply embarassing and painful to watch. Batman & Robin was too over-the-top and filled with annoying one-liners. The movie tried so hard to be the biggest Bat movie, but it ended up dying under its own weight and literally killing the whole Batman franchise. End Of Days was decent enough, but not very memorable. The Sixth Day tried to be a hi-tech action thriller about the dangers of genetics and the result was a harmless if stupid movie that didn´t make much sense (could someone please try to make a realistic movie dealing with genetics?). The 6th Day flopped and Arnie was in trouble. Collateral Damage was obviously planned as a career saver, but then came 9\/11 and everything changed. The release date was delayed and when the film was finally released critics slammed it and moviegoers didn´t care that much about it.You can enjoy Collateral Damage if you don´t expect too much from it. It´s - unfortunately - a typical Arnie movie with lots of action and... well, more action. Arnie does his best, but he isn´t exactly the greatest actor working. He´s at his best when playing guys like this, but it´s getting tiresome to see him play the same character every single time. I´m sure this movie would´ve been a direct-to-video release if it wasn´t for Arnie and director Andrew Davis. Too bad they didn´t manage to create an above-average movie.It remains to be seen if Arnie´s career continues its downhill as T3 Rise Of The Machines comes out later this year. Arnie´s obviously getting too old for an action hero and he just can´t be anything else. Arnie in a comedy? True Lies (Arnie´s best movie, in my opinion) was a successful mix of high-tech action and comedy, but how about Junior or Jingle All The Way? They were both lame, to say the least.Here´s a movie idea Arnie as a retired cop (how original) who now lives in a peaceful retirement community. Suddenly old people start disappearing and Arnie is lured back to work to find the missing elderly. Arnie discovers a massive government conspiracy and the hunter becomes hunted as well.

Though I like all kinds of comedies it didn´t really feel like a my kind of movie. But in January I saw the trailer a few times and it looked very promising. I decided to see the movie when it hit the theaters in Finland and I´m glad I did because this movie is very, very good.I won´t go to details, but in short Wedding is one of the best romantic comedies that has come out of Holly... Ooops, I guess we shouldn´t say Hollywood because this was an independent production.

Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it, like my heart's going to cave in.  --Ricky Fitz (American Beauty)Alfonso Cuaron's Mexican Gem Y Tu Mama Tambien Demonstrates the True Magic that is Hispanic CinemaAlfonso Cuaron wrote and directed a beautiful screenplay full of life, noble characters and a heartbreaking reality.  More importantly, he created a realistic high caliber film that revolved around adolescents and their struggle with growing up and finding out who they really are.The first time I saw Y Tu Mama Tambien in the movie theaters I was completely enthralled. Seriously, I fell in love. Within the first week of viewing the film, I saw it another two times. I have admired Alfonso Cuaron ever since. Later on I found out that he had also directed two other films that I had greatly enjoyed years back, A Little Princess and Great Expectations, which were really different from this film.  Personally speaking, Y Tu Mama Tambien was more than just another teen movie to me, (i.e. American Pie, Can't Hardly Wait) instead it was a film about the connections one makes in life, not only with others but with one's self. To be perfectly honest, when researching Y Tu Mama Tambien and its director, Alfonso Cuaron, I began to cry because I felt so proud of him and his work and all the praise he was receiving for it. I know, I know-- this is quite pathetic, but before you judge me let me at least explain.Every article and review I came across did nothing but praise his work and in turn I felt my heart grow with pride. Why, you may ask, am I proud of someone I do not even know? It's simple He DESERVES such marvelous acclaim. The thing about his film is that it has no bullshit, it's attempt to transcend the reality in which the youth are a part of, is so accurate it can only make you stop and think. Moreover, as a Hispanic I was proud to see a Hispanic filmmaker gain such wonderful recognition in the American film industry, because it is the worldwide leader in filmmaking, and for decades Hispanic cinema has gone unnoticed by moviegoers. Hollywood films are regarded so highly, and yet the Hispanic film industry, in my opinion, has produced a finer quality of films within the past couple of years. Not only did Alfonso Cuaron direct, produce and edit the film, but he also wrote the screenplay. Yet another reason why he deserves such recognition.As soon as the film commenced I was intrigued, simply because Cuaron had the guts necessary to make such a strong opening scene, despite what critics and viewers might say. What made that first scene so perfect was that it was neither raunchy nor inappropriate; moreover it projected how sex actually is, explicit, but innocent at the same time. It's clumsy and awkward and real (Sex). It never looked staged or rehearsed, but instead gave the movie a more relatable feel. Many viewers may have been appalled at the film's sexual motif, but as one writer put it, I mean, teenage boys do have sex, with Cuaron simply replying, And not always with a pie (Hot and Spicy). The films sexual scenes were not added simply to save the film, unlike the brainless movies American Pie and Road Trip, but instead were carefully constructed as mature scenarios used to expose the vulnerability and loneliness inside each and every one of us.Actors Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna did more than just play a pair of stoned, horny male teenagers. They managed to deliver lively character's complete with depth, wit, and attitude; a far cry from any one character in a teen film such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Right off the bat we are introduced to these naïve and not-so-innocent young men who think they are ready to conquer the world before them; (a common attitude in the lives of many adolescents, whether they'd like to admit it or not). The film's two male leads were more than just weed smoking horndogs, they are also a pair of friends who truly loved each and unfortunately got separated during the journey called life.Another great aspect of Y Tu Mama Tambien is how the female in the movie was not given the ditsy, self-indulgent, shallow personality most girls in teen films are insulted with. Cuaron creates a striking woman, both internally and externally, without having to include any stylish clothes or catchy lines. In turn we see how these young men fall for Luisa (played by Maribel Verdu), because she is an attractive older woman who offers them a friendship unlike any other. Within a short amount of time, Luisa has earned their trust and their hearts simply by holding honest, mature and wholehearted conversations. Cuaron's creation of a strong female lead was a nice departure to some of the female roles Hollywood has been feeding us.Alfonso Cuaron did not stop there. He went beyond the call of duty by adding an omniscient voice-over narrator, in the style of French New Wave Cinema, giving the entire movie a new perspective. Inspired by Godard's Masculine Femenine, he added third-person narrative with the intent of creating a point of view that would be very objective(Sex) and so that the context would be an important character (Au-Cinema). Not only does the omniscient, third person narrator help audiences understand the characters pasts and inner thoughts better, but it also makes offhanded but pointed comments about the country's political situation (Time '02).The film's ending made it even better since it did not deliver the happy-ending one is accustomed to in this genre. Viewers find out the real reason Luisa decided to join the boys on the road trip was because she was diagnosed with cancer, which eventually took her life, and we also see the strong friendship that Julio and Tenoch once had fall apart never to be restored. The depressing ending closes this movie beautifully because it captures the reality of life in which heartbreaking things do, in fact, occur, whether they seem fair or not. Alfonso Cuaron explains why he chose to end the film this way, The ending is kind of sad, but I think it is also an affirmation of life. Even if you see these two boys completely f*** it up, you see that you don't have to. Life is amazing. It has all these freedoms and possibilities. That youthful energy exists (Au-Cinema).  I could not have said it better myself.As I write I am trying to gather my thoughts together, which has become an impossible task because the more I read about the movie, the more emotional I get. I feel so silly, but then a random quote from a movie just popped into my head that perfectly explains why I feel this way. Lester Burnham, Kevin Spacey's character in American Beauty, once saidIt's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much. My heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst.And then I remember.to relax, and not try to hold on to it.  And then it flows through me like rain. And I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life.This film, Y Tu Mama Tambien, is so relatable, it's so beautifully constructed that 'my heart fills up like a balloon' and 'then it flows through me like rain.' Y Tu Mama Tambien vibrates with such life, love and energy, you cannot help but want to take a road trip and spend all hours of the night sharing your most intimate stories with those that know you the best, especially before you grow up and wish you had done it long ago. The road of life is long and hard, but the road towards adulthood and self-discovery is even more perilous. If you enjoy films with realistic qualities, if you love life and your friends even more, do not miss Alfonso Cuaron's brilliant Mexican film Y Tu Mama Tambien; he manages to portray sex, drugs, and friendship in style so breathtaking the whole world took note.

Time is wasted on dialogs too long and too many for the plot. To quote a phrase from the film 'Amadeus', this film is 'too many notes'. There are no twists, no turns, and no surprises of any kind. Just a man (Sean), being drunken, was so mad about his wife having been beaten up, shot a government official from the institution suddenly and aimlessly. He became mad (why?) and was kept up in the asylum for ten years. I am not convinced as there is room for development to explain on a man to become insane. When he got out from the institution, his ex-wife decided to leave her second husband and two daughters. That is the end of the story. A bit strange for such ending because what I think of is that the wife deliberately used the second man for support for those ten whole years. I cannot believe this is the norm among American people, if it is.The message from the writer may be 'Love is difficult' just as Sean Pan said it in the movie. That kind of love of the girl to the boy, and vice versa, are 'blind' ones, per se. If the girl was determined to 'love' without cause, why she was getting so depressed and hopeless. With that kind of 'love', she would certainly get hurt sooner or later. Someone would be hurt at the same time. Pity on her because she did not know what she was doing, especially to the second man and her other two daughters. The latter three persons did not do anything wrong and they should not be treated in this way. When the girl was leaving, I don't understand her facial expression. Was it guilt? Self-pity? Or, Relief?Despite all these shortcomings, the figures in the film were at least honest people, except the neighbor who wanted to rape the girl. My impression is, however, that the figures in the film are not doing things with their head, rather with a low grade of mixed feelings. So, why is the movie title so lovely? If you are in bad mood or that you don't want to think, watch this film, but you will nonetheless be disappointed.

I was thrilled with the opening, firstly Jamie Lee had returned, secondly the movie was continuing the H20 storyline and doing so with credibility, tying up all the loose ends (with exception to where the hell is her son!??) and opening with the perfect setting for a new movie.. a sanitarium.When Laurie Strode has Michael up on the roof, and has so perfectly planned his demise almost to the smallest detail I thought it was brilliant, but I knew something was up, when something this brilliant has happened in the first ten minutes of the film.. If the film had ended at the the sanitarium perhaps because Laurie was'nt at home in Haddonfield as Michael may have expected where a web cam debarcle was taking place after slicing and dicing all the twits at the Myers house, he may have tracked her to the sanitarium where a showdown could have been staged... For someone who has been living in fear for twenty three years of their brother..it was a rather quiet ending for Laurie Strode.... As it was for Jamie LLoyd in H6.Apart from the opening scene of this movie.overall the movie lacked substance.. Why did Michael go home?

In fact I'd bet that he actually hoped they didn't understand everything. So I did not find it strange or surprising when after finishing the movie I felt quite confused. But the movie made me think for a very long time, which in my opinion is what a good film should do. There are so many aspects to this film that if you give them a chance and think about them, they will keep you reeling for hours on possible interpretations. The first and probably most important aspect of this film dealt with love. From what I have seen of his films, love is Antonioni's favorite subject. But this love was different than that of past films; it is much more shallow and un-centered. Thomas, the photographer, is surrounded by women, he goes from one to the next without thinking twice, treating them like dogs the entire time. But he can do this and get away with it because he is a famous photographer and can make the women what they all desperately want to be, Beautiful. For The first half of the movie I honestly did not like his character whatsoever. Whereas in the past the director has chosen mainly to explore the ups and downs of married life, or the problems of being hopelessly devoted to one person, he now points the camera at the single, care free, over sexed, youth of the sixties. Half an hour into the movie I found myself wondering what the heart of the film was going to be. We were introduced to Thomas and his world, but there seemed to be no conflict driving the story forward. Then came the quasi-murder mystery. This is what is really interesting and unique about this film in my opinion. Antonioni for a while leads us to believe that the movie is going to turn into some suspense thriller, or murder mystery, but never seems to quite get there. He has all the elements ready to go, but never follows through with them. He introduces this alluring and mysterious woman who is in on the murder and then never brings her back. The murder victim is discovered, but his identity is never revealed, nor a motive given for his murder. Thomas, after a very energetic and exciting photo investigation seems to not really care too much as to what happens with the investigations results, only telling a couple of his friends who couldn't care less. Antonioni seems to have used this whole murder mystery convention as some sort of glue to hold the rest of the real story together. The story of a mindless, beauty obsessed, celebrity idolizing, drug addicted, and violence obsessed culture. Probably my favorite scene in the film is after fighting over the piece of broken guitar with the other fans; Thomas just discards his prize as garbage. Something that kept bugging me was the antique shop. I kept wondering what in the world it had to do with anything in the movie; it stuck out like a sore thumb. But I knew it that there was some major purpose or explanation for its existence in the film, and then it just kind of clicked. Upon his first entry into the Antique store Thomas encounters an angry old man who we eventually find out is not the stores real owner, the true owner is a beautiful young woman who is planning to sell the old place and travel the world in search of something new. All this stuff she owns, the gold of past cultures, is old and useless now. She has a hard time making a living because nobody wants the stuff any longer. Here is where I think Antonioni's major message is hidden That is the way life is, it moves on constantly, things change, people die, cultures evolve and the only thing that remains in the end is nature itself. Antonioni finishes the film beautifully, Thomas stands alone in a large field of grass, the only thing heard is the wind and the trees, as the camera backs away slowly, he disappears leaving nothing but the grass blowing in the wind, for like all the antiques and all the people that created them in the past, eventually Thomas's life will end and so will the current popular culture in which he takes part. Change is life's only constant.

Ended in the typical Happy-Romantic film manner? Or givien Seth the axe?The ending had a special significance. Maggie died in the same way that Seth got a human life. They were both trying to enjoy their lives to the fullest. Feel what they had never felt before.Two more issues that people bring up are Nick cage's acting and the cliches in the movie. Cage has never really struck me as a untalented one-genre actor that some think he is. I've enjoyed watching him in most of his roles. Sure he looks and acts a bit like Big Moose at times, but for the most part I don't notice. BTW, if the movie were cliched, it would have ended right after Maggie died. We wouldn't have been shown the montage after or the beautiful scene in which Seth and Cassiel discuss the happenings of the past few days and more importantly, we wouldn't have got what I feel is one of the most touching lines that I've ever heard in a movieSeth I would rather have had one breath of her hair....one kiss from her mouth....one touch of her hand, than eternity without it.

Dennis Franz (who I usually can't stand) was also cast well for his short scenes. Even Andre Braughner stands out as Cassiel.All the angels scenes were well choreographed and played out with some mind blowing instrumental music. I especially enjoyed the scenes where the camera angle is blown over the city and we see angels in places like helipads, etc.I've never really enjoyed to many other tragic movies, Arlington Road and Romeo and Juliet come to mind, But City of Angels really stands out. I will be buying the DVD once I can afford it. Although I should add that I doubt the movie will be very repeat-watch friendly. Its more of a 1 watch experience.Another thing I want to add is that after watching the film, I finally understood the song, 'Iris' by the Goo Goo Dolls which is in the Soundtrack.
