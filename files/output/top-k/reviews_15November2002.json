I was 8 when I saw Poltergeist and I have been deathly afraid of clowns and under the bed ever since. (Even though I'm 14) So, seeing this movie was extremely frightening for me!   In it we follow this depressed woman who has lost her husband in the war.  She lives in her dark secluded mansion with her 2 children, who can't be near the light because if they are exposed to it they will die.  So, the movie is all dark, which is freaky.  In the movie Grace Stewart (the mother) played by Nicole Kidman is slowly going insane and she has hired some new servants to replace her old ones, who just disappeared one day!  Grace is noticing all these strange things happening in her house and she suspects Natzis are hiding in it, though soon the suspicion turns to ghosts because of the freaky pale faced daughter, who can see one of them.  The servants know what's up, though they are acting like they don't.  Then, Grace begins investigating all of this, and looks at old books and tries to find out if the house has a bad history.  She even finds a book of the dead, which has pictures of dead people in it, all dressed up.  grace gets really freaked out, and tries to walk into town to get help from the church, but during her walk, fog surrounds her and she finds her husband!  She takes him home, and he's all depressed, and doesn't seem to know what's happening, though again the servants do.  The children are absolutely ecstatic to have their daddy home, but then begin telling him terrible things that their mommy has done to them.  Because, children, mommy went crazy!  So, the next day the father disappears, and more terrible things start to happen.  Grace knows the servants know something so she sends them away because she thinks they are evil.  Then, that night, while looking through the book of the dead, she sees that the SERVANTS are in there!!!!  They were ghosts.  Her children, who have snuck outside, have just realized this because they see their gravestones in the yard!  And the servants are creepily following them!  So the kids run inside to their mothers arms, and Grace tells them to hide upstairs, while she tries to stop the 3 ghosts.  But, while upstairs, hiding in the closet, the kids notice that there are even more ghosts there!  And then you see this horrific old woman's face open the closet!  Meanwhile, downstairs, the ghosts are telling Grace that they just want to help.  She runs upstairs into the room where her kids are hiding, and sees a group of people at a table.  The old woman is writing some stuff very fast, and the kids are telling her what their mother did to them!  Grace screams, and takes all the papers and throws them in the air and destroys them.  Suddenly, the scene changes and we see it from the other people's point of view!  The papers are flying up by themself, and they are trying to reach the ghosts that live in the house!  So, now we find out that Grace and her children, and the servants, and the lost soul of the father are ALL ghosts!  Apparently, one day while they were alive, Grace went crazy and suffocated her children with pillows and shot herself in the head.  It appeared to Grace and the children that they had survived and that God had given them a second chance!  But, sadly, that was not the case.  They were ghosts.  It ends up with the servants telling Grace that they didn't know they were dead either, and wanted to break it gently to her.  They also say that once in a while they will make contact with the other world, but only sometimes.  They decide to stay at the house, especially since now the children can be exposed to light, (because they're already dead) It really made you think and it was a great horror movie.  All great movies make you think, not like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, both of which are terribly predictable.  There are so many twists and turns in this movie, and it was really freaky in the theatre!  Go see it, or if you have, watch it again!

If this movie had any other title you would not have a clue as to what happens in the end and even though it happens and you know it will it is still a surprise when it does happen.

However she finds that many of her old friends feel differently about her years later.  Meanwhile she struggles to feel happy and help her daughter past the split while loneliness and difficulties pile up on top of one another.I approached this with the same caution that one would approach a dangerous dog that has just dozed off.  I don't like romantic dramas as a rule, I like romantic comedies &#150; I don't mind slush and whatnot if it has a bit of spark to it.  When this started with a Ricki Lake type show I assumed it was going to have a certain amount of energy to it.  However it quickly gets dragged down into mush and sentimental as it gradually begins to drag it's heals.The comedy is non-existent, but in fairness this is a drama rather than a comedy.  However the drama really doesn't grip you or even make you care.  Instead of content the film throws in sappy music and shot focus\/slow-mo shots to try and create emotion with tacky tools.  The central romance between Birdee and Justin fails for the most part because he just pops in and out for the first half of the film and I never felt their relationship was real or worth me caring about.Bullock is miscast as Birdee.  She excels in goofy girl next door role where she gets to be sparky and sassy.  Here she has to mope a lot and `soul search' &#150; that isn't a good look for her and she doesn't carry it off.  Connick Jnr is actually an OK support actor but he isn't given a chance to work with too low a screen time for an important role.  Also his character just doesn't feel real &#150; he's a single guy who's really nice and he's an architect! Oh and he is really deep and sensitive.  I'm not saying there's no one like this but the script should have given him at least some grounding in reality.  Rowlands is feisty as Birdee's mother and ironically the only character who brings a bit of life to the film.Overall this film is overlong and far too slow.  It has no spark or energy and relies heavily on music and directing tricks to try and squeeze every bit of emotion out of it.  It feels like a daytime TVM film that has only made it to a cinema on the strength of the cast.  For hardcore rom-drama fans only, far too sappy and inconsequential.

However she finds that many of her old friends feel differently about her years later.  Meanwhile she struggles to feel happy and help her daughter past the split while loneliness and difficulties pile up on top of one another.I approached this with the same caution that one would approach a dangerous dog that has just dozed off.  I don't like romantic dramas as a rule, I like romantic comedies &#150; I don't mind slush and whatnot if it has a bit of spark to it.  When this started with a Ricki Lake type show I assumed it was going to have a certain amount of energy to it.  However it quickly gets dragged down into mush and sentimental as it gradually begins to drag it's heals.The comedy is non-existent, but in fairness this is a drama rather than a comedy.  However the drama really doesn't grip you or even make you care.  Instead of content the film throws in sappy music and shot focus\/slow-mo shots to try and create emotion with tacky tools.  The central romance between Birdee and Justin fails for the most part because he just pops in and out for the first half of the film and I never felt their relationship was real or worth me caring about.Bullock is miscast as Birdee.  She excels in goofy girl next door role where she gets to be sparky and sassy.  Here she has to mope a lot and `soul search' &#150; that isn't a good look for her and she doesn't carry it off.  Connick Jnr is actually an OK support actor but he isn't given a chance to work with too low a screen time for an important role.  Also his character just doesn't feel real &#150; he's a single guy who's really nice and he's an architect! Oh and he is really deep and sensitive.  I'm not saying there's no one like this but the script should have given him at least some grounding in reality.

He is writing a book and struggling to make the move from a comedy writer on TV to a `more worthy' pursuit of proper literature.  Combined with this he is trying to balance the women in his life, going out with an 17 year old girl, his lesbian ex-wife is writing a book based on the break-up of their relationship and a hostile relationship with Mary begins to involve him.Rightly known as one of Allen's best films.  Here he manages to get the tone right between out and out comedy and a more mature introspective look at relationships and self.  This isn't my favourite of his films as I admit to liking his `earlier, funnier films', but this falls between the two phases and there is much to enjoy here.On one level the film is a love story to New York - it isn't about New York so much as about some of it's inhabitants, but the camera takes in that skyline every chance it gets and the music compliments it well.  On the main plot we have the usual Allen storyline of relationships starting and breaking down with the usual problems and witty remarks - it's the same story he's been telling for years but he manages to get away with it so who am I to pass judgement?  It is good unless you hate Allen and it does allow comedy even if it feels a little self indulgent - at least it finishes on a positive note.It is flawed even by his standards.  It's quite pretentious in many ways. Of course a lot of his films are but with, say, Annie Hall, there was enough real good laughs to cover all bases.  Here the arty shots and slightly less comic feel to it reveal him to be soul searching and not really drawing on any wider experiences.  I know that anyone can only truly draw on their own experiences but this film resembles no life I've ever lived and is solely focused on Allen's own arty lifestyle.Hence it's not my favourite - I don't really like him when he tries to be very arty and deep.  1 he is usually being selfish and almost making the film for himself and 2 it's like he's saying to the mass audience `I'm too good for you so I'm not even going to try and make this easy for you'. Here though he just about avoids that trap.As director and actor Allen is good and copes with his own problems and the delivery of good lines.  Keaton is given a better character than Anne Hall but seems to get less funny as a result.  Streep is happily only in a few scenes and Hemingway is annoying.  This is the Allen & New York show and they carry it well enough to cover the weaknesses.Not my favourite Allen film and indeed not his - at the time he begged for it to be shelved and he'd do it again for free but it was released.  I wonder was it too arty for him or not arty enough?  Regardless fans will enjoy this as I did, but many others will prefer more of the humour and less of the big words and naval gazing.

In fact, I never really used to like Bond. It's supposed to be excellent action entertainment with beautiful girls but all I saw were overlong boring adventures with long boring talking scenes and not enough action. My opinion has changed greatly. With all the hype surrounding 'Die Another Day', I decided to give Bond another go and I rented 'Goldfinger'. I was not dissapointed. Quite recently, I rented 'From Russia With Love' but was somewhat dissapointed. It wasn't the best bond film as many have said but it was relatively entertaining. I've seen some other Bond films in the past few years but at least for now, 'Goldfinger' is my favorite 007 film, with 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' coming in a close second (In fact, George Lazenby is my favorite Bond and if he was in this film then I would have my dream Bond film). The plot of this film once again features agent 007 James Bond (Sean Connery) who is assigned to find out about Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) a man intent on smuggling gold but finds out that Goldfinger is actually going to rob the enourmas Fort Knox of it's gold with the help of his henchman Odd Job (Harold Sakata) and Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman). What follows is a story filled with sex, violence, action, a strong as a post henchman, the coolest car ever to see the light of day, a lesbian called Pussy Galore and a hat that decapitates people. Just a normal day for James Bond, then, isn't it? Which brings us to the man himself, James Bond! Sean Connery, in my opinion, isn't the best James Bond but here he brings that certain presence to the screen that everyone, male and female, will love. He's just amazing in the role but, luckily, all the co-stars are strong actors as well. Gert Frobe is very convincing in his role as the millionaire maniac Goldfinger but it's his henchman Odd Job played by Harold Sakata who steals the show with his hat-throwing and golf ball-crushing. Then, of course, we have the Bond Girl with that name Pussy Galore. Honor Blackman is great as the Bond girl even if her role is a little too small compared to later Bond girls. Of course the co-Bond girl is Shirley Eaton in the role that sees her painted gold and killed which is the image most associated with this film. Very impressive. Of course, a Bond film wouldn't be a Bond film without the gadgets. This film features the Aston Martin, another image always associated with James Bond films. This car features a whole load of features sure to get rid of the bad guys if Bond has any problems and is responsible for some of the best scenes in the movies. Overall, 'Goldfinger' is a very impressive Bond film and a very impressive action film on it's own. This film is near perfect, from the gunbarrel opening and the Connery's shocking line to the gold paint to the golf scene to Pussy Galore to the amazing raid on Fort Knox, nothing about this film could really do better. If you're looking for the Bond film, look no further than 'Goldfinger'!

This car features a whole load of features sure to get rid of the bad guys if Bond has any problems and is responsible for some of the best scenes in the movies. Overall, 'Goldfinger' is a very impressive Bond film and a very impressive action film on it's own. This film is near perfect, from the gunbarrel opening and the Connery's shocking line to the gold paint to the golf scene to Pussy Galore to the amazing raid on Fort Knox, nothing about this film could really do better.

In fact, I never really used to like Bond. It's supposed to be excellent action entertainment with beautiful girls but all I saw were overlong boring adventures with long boring talking scenes and not enough action. My opinion has changed greatly. With all the hype surrounding 'Die Another Day', I decided to give Bond another go and I rented 'Goldfinger'. I was not dissapointed. Quite recently, I rented 'From Russia With Love' but was somewhat dissapointed. It wasn't the best bond film as many have said but it was relatively entertaining. I've seen some other Bond films in the past few years but at least for now, 'Goldfinger' is my favorite 007 film, with 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' coming in a close second (In fact, George Lazenby is my favorite Bond and if he was in this film then I would have my dream Bond film). The plot of this film once again features agent 007 James Bond (Sean Connery) who is assigned to find out about Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) a man intent on smuggling gold but finds out that Goldfinger is actually going to rob the enourmas Fort Knox of it's gold with the help of his henchman Odd Job (Harold Sakata) and Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman). What follows is a story filled with sex, violence, action, a strong as a post henchman, the coolest car ever to see the light of day, a lesbian called Pussy Galore and a hat that decapitates people. Just a normal day for James Bond, then, isn't it? Which brings us to the man himself, James Bond! Sean Connery, in my opinion, isn't the best James Bond but here he brings that certain presence to the screen that everyone, male and female, will love. He's just amazing in the role but, luckily, all the co-stars are strong actors as well. Gert Frobe is very convincing in his role as the millionaire maniac Goldfinger but it's his henchman Odd Job played by Harold Sakata who steals the show with his hat-throwing and golf ball-crushing. Then, of course, we have the Bond Girl with that name Pussy Galore. Honor Blackman is great as the Bond girl even if her role is a little too small compared to later Bond girls. Of course the co-Bond girl is Shirley Eaton in the role that sees her painted gold and killed which is the image most associated with this film. Very impressive. Of course, a Bond film wouldn't be a Bond film without the gadgets. This film features the Aston Martin, another image always associated with James Bond films.

Culkin and Hirsch give painfully accurate portrayals of young teenaged boys burdened by every aspect of what they perceive to be a harsh world.  The church and the school can't understand them, Sister Assumpta keeps a close eye on them, and they're suspected of every wrongdoing (rightly or not).  Worst of all, one girl, Margie Flynn (Jena Malone), draws Francis to the edges of the boys' club as his feelings for her start to cloud his loyalties to his band of brothers.There's nothing simple here.  Sister Assumpta isn't just a dragon lady out to get the boys because she hates children; she feels frustrated by her inability to connect with the boys.  Tim Sullivan isn't just the designer of mad plots (such as the key scheme to steal a panther from the zoo and unleash it on the Sister); he's a disaffected youth trying his hardest to deal with the realities of his life in the only way he knows how.  Francis Doyle isn't just a dreamer; he's a conflicted boy in the midst of exiting childhood for good and he knows it.  The comics he draws aren't just daydreams of a boy's mind, they're his own interpretation of the ways his life changes day by day.It's a textured tale that offers realistic interaction between the boys (Culkin and Hirsch turn in standout performances) and the girl (Malone in a very vulnerable supporting role).  To tie the film together, and weave the fantasy realm of the Atomic Trinity into the real-life world of the school grounds, director Peter Care adds in animation sequences that bring Francis' story to life.  Produced by Todd MacFarlane's studio (the same group that did the animated 'Spawn' for HBO), the boys' alter-egos reflect their flesh-and-blood counterparts, all the way to the bitter end.'Altar Boys' is a worthy effort, a tender reminiscence to the times in all boys' lives where they must make the journey from boyhood to manhood.  It's not just one step, either, it's a series of obstacles and challenges that daunt even the best of us.  This film is worth seeing, even for those of you who don't happen to be altar boys.

For some reason, they titled this movie as if it were a sequel.  When Jackie decided to make this movie, he was being greatly influenced by the smash hit Raiders of the Lost Ark, and wanted to make a movie in that adventure style.  This movie could have been really, really great if it had been made entirely the way Jackie had it envisioned at the start of production.  The movie has a great beginning, and then it is destroyed by an agonizing slow middle, and then it picks up again with an action packed ending.  The reason the movie has that horrible middle is because of the stunt that went wrong at the beginning of the film.  As all Jackie fans know, this is the film that almost killed Chan.  In the beginning action sequence, he does this awesome chase scene where he is bounding across the walls of a castle.  In the first take, Jackie actually made it across.  But being a perfectionist, he tried for a second take.  The first take partially broke the branch of the tree he jumps on, and on the second take, the branch broke completely, sending Jackie crashing to the ground and busting his head on a rock. I am mentioning all this because this is the reason the middle of the movie is so slow.  Production could only be halted for a short time.  They could not wait until Jackie had fully recovered.  So, as soon as he was able to get out of bed, they re-wrote the middle part of the movie to exclude all the eye-popping stunts that Jackie had originally planned.  They continued filming this lame, muddled attempt at a romance plot until Jackie was more healed.  Once Jackie was back to 100 percent, they started filming the movie the way they had originally intended  with amazing stunts and incredible action choreography.  The end of the movie picks up with Jackie, his side kick, and the love interest, infiltrating a castle run by monks, and they try to steal a treasure guarded by fiesty amazon women who wear lots of '80s style makeup.  As ridiculous as that all sounds, the fight scenes at the end are among the best that Jackie has ever done.  Its really amazing and a lot of fun to watch just for the choreography aspect.  Check out one of the hardest hits I have ever seen, when one of the amazons comes flying at Jackie from about 8 feet in the air, he kicks her in mid flight, and she spins completely around and slams HEAD FIRST in to the dirt!  I don't care if there was a stunt pad there, it is a HARD LANDING!  OUCH!  There is no way the stunt person walked away from that unharmed.  The second movie OPERATION CONDOR was a lot better as a whole.  That is one of my all time favorite Jackie Chan films, and I still watch it over and over again.  But PART 2 (the first of the films) is definitely a must-see (despite the confusing title).  My recommendation is this  Get the movie, watch the first part until he escapes from the natives, then FAST FORWARD through the entiremiddle, DO NOT BOTHER to watch it, it is totally irrelevant, and start watching again as they infiltrate the castle.  You wont be sorry.  Don't believe all the other bad reviews about this film.

They had no rage in them - as personified by the lead character, Jake Heke.This points to the change that is going on among this great tribe of people. They are learning new ways in a strange world (modern technology is not a culture - it seems that technology can only thrive if culture is absent).Heke's wife tries to bring some semblance of normalcy to the erratic background the father provides by his drunken rage. It is impossible, and the only solution is made clear by the social worker and Beth, Jake's wife at the near end of the film ...we once were warriors.As Paid said, this is a film about people - perhaps about all the conquered tribal peoples of the world... yes, indeed, - and so it will stand the test of time and become a true classic forever.- Zafoid ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"15 November 2002","score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  I could go on about this movie forever, so I'll try to keep it simple.This is a fantastic movie.Now, purists will complain about the historical accuracy, because they are more concerned with history than the making of a good movie.

OK, it is not Gone with the Wind, but she is tough, she acts well, and you never get the feeling she was given the role solely on her looks (probably true, however she played her character well).  For instance, if you compared her role against the acting of Heidi Schanz in Universal Soldier  The Return, you would give Kari Wuhrer an Oscar.  She never succumbs to lame one-liners, her worry over her children's safety appears genuine, and she is believable in a last-stand-against-the-enemy situation.I loved this movie!  Definitely one for the DVD collection.  Do not go see this movie if you are expecting another Citizen Kane, however at least the title will give you a pretty good idea of what to expect.

However at the end of his life he realizes that money can't buy love nor can it replace the affection of a family.So what? who cares? who didn't already know this? I mean, can this movie be any more insipid? Can this movie be any more cold, clinical or lackluster?Much has been said about Citizen Kane's technical greatness, about it's innovations, and that's the reason why most people consider it the greatest film ever done. So what are you telling me? That just because Orson Welles put his camera here and used some shadows there it makes this film superior to all the other true works of art like La Strada? Are you telling me that technical values are more important than artistic values? Because that's pretty much what Citizen Kane is a gutless exercise in style. If technical innovations were any important why isn't The Jazz Singer the greatest film ever done. It was the first film to incorporate sound to movies and that's much more important than any of the tricks Welles pulls out of his ass throughout this movie. But The Jazz Singer gets no respect (and rightfully so since it's such a mediocre movie), so why on earth does Citizen Kane gets so much praise? It's not like it was the first film to use any of those techniques. Deep focus, low camera angles, use of shadows, they had all been used before and they have all been used after, and many times they have given much better individual results. Citizen Kane is only historically significant for being the first film to use them all in one film (since then on Orson Welles has been given the credit for something he didn't come up with). Innovations are just innovations, new things, and more than half a century later it's stupid to think they still mean anything.On top of it, Citizen Kane is pretty average in every other aspect. There's not one single memorable performance in the film. Joseph Cotton is fine but he had the bad luck of having to share the screen with Welles (belting out one of the most distastefully over-the-top performances of his career). The performances do come alive at times and that's entirely due to the great script co-written by Welles himself and Herman Mankiewicz. To tell you the truth if Herman was anything like his brother, all the witty and memorable phrases in the film are his doing. They're fast, intelligent and they provide Kane with its most relaxed moments. The rest of the script (which I suppose was Welles's work) is too melodramatic and pretentious.But more than that, Citizen Kane fails to accomplish one of the primary goals of any movie connect with the audience. I don't know what Welles was thinking when he thought anybody was going to identify with this megalomaniac who makes life impossible for everyone around him and stills expects them to love him, understand him, and keep an open mind about him at all times. I normally wouldn't have a problem with characters that are emotionally unavailable, they make for some interesting character studies, but this is ridiculous. Normally director's have the good judgement to show both sides of the character, his bad side and his good side, but Charles Foster Kane's personality is so big and strong he comes off as a plain simple bastard. I can't imagine anyone saying Gee, I watched Citizen Kane and I really felt it spoke to me, maybe Louis B. Meyer did, maybe Welles himself did, maybe Bill Gates does, but all of us this side of the socio-economical spectrum can't help but just don't care. Really, I don't care about Charles Foster Kane's life, I don't care about his feelings and I don't care about a single frame of this movie.Maybe when the movie was released it was actually significant, with all its innovations but after so many years those innovations don't matter anymore, and that's when a movie really dates. Go ahead and watch it, but if you've seen films like Pulp Fiction, The Godfather, Persona, 8 1\/2, Battleship Potemkin, Andrei Rublev, Rashomon, etc, then be prepared to be disappointed by a movie that doesn't live up to its reputation.

It's not like it was the first film to use any of those techniques. Deep focus, low camera angles, use of shadows, they had all been used before and they have all been used after, and many times they have given much better individual results. Citizen Kane is only historically significant for being the first film to use them all in one film (since then on Orson Welles has been given the credit for something he didn't come up with). Innovations are just innovations, new things, and more than half a century later it's stupid to think they still mean anything.On top of it, Citizen Kane is pretty average in every other aspect. There's not one single memorable performance in the film. Joseph Cotton is fine but he had the bad luck of having to share the screen with Welles (belting out one of the most distastefully over-the-top performances of his career). The performances do come alive at times and that's entirely due to the great script co-written by Welles himself and Herman Mankiewicz. To tell you the truth if Herman was anything like his brother, all the witty and memorable phrases in the film are his doing. They're fast, intelligent and they provide Kane with its most relaxed moments. The rest of the script (which I suppose was Welles's work) is too melodramatic and pretentious.But more than that, Citizen Kane fails to accomplish one of the primary goals of any movie connect with the audience. I don't know what Welles was thinking when he thought anybody was going to identify with this megalomaniac who makes life impossible for everyone around him and stills expects them to love him, understand him, and keep an open mind about him at all times. I normally wouldn't have a problem with characters that are emotionally unavailable, they make for some interesting character studies, but this is ridiculous. Normally director's have the good judgement to show both sides of the character, his bad side and his good side, but Charles Foster Kane's personality is so big and strong he comes off as a plain simple bastard. I can't imagine anyone saying Gee, I watched Citizen Kane and I really felt it spoke to me, maybe Louis B. Meyer did, maybe Welles himself did, maybe Bill Gates does, but all of us this side of the socio-economical spectrum can't help but just don't care. Really, I don't care about Charles Foster Kane's life, I don't care about his feelings and I don't care about a single frame of this movie.Maybe when the movie was released it was actually significant, with all its innovations but after so many years those innovations don't matter anymore, and that's when a movie really dates. Go ahead and watch it, but if you've seen films like Pulp Fiction, The Godfather, Persona, 8 1\/2, Battleship Potemkin, Andrei Rublev, Rashomon, etc, then be prepared to be disappointed by a movie that doesn't live up to its reputation.

BUT, like most films of the superhero genre, this film falls prey to some of the more common 'pitfalls'.POSSIBLE SPOILERS-I realize finding an actor who matches the characteristics of these comic book characters must be a daunting task for the film-makers since fans expect the actor to look and talk in a certain way. I am still two minded about the casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker\/Spiderman. On the one hand, he shows a very deep, emotional side to the character of Peter Parker through his inability to blend in with his fellow students at school, the emotional turmoil and guilt he feels over his uncles death and his secret love for his neighbor, Mary Jane. On the other hand, as Spiderman, he lacks the physical prowess necessary to intimidate his enemies and stand as a figure of strength and justice. He appears to simply enjoy swinging from building to building, laughing and spitting out witty one - liners, occasionally preventing a few minor crimes and trying hard to impress the girl of his dreams. All in all, his portrayal of the masked web slinger is somewhat adolescent, as he seems more like a child with a new toy than a man who's coming to terms with a powerful gift and his obligation to use it responsibly.  Another negative aspect of this film is the running time. Although it is necessary to give the audience enough time to relate to and understand the characters and plot, there were many scenes here which the film could have simply done without (or edited versions of ), such as the drawn out hospital scenes with Peter and Mary Jane \/ Aunt May as well as the numerous scenes at the Osborne house in which Norman SLOWLY realizes what is happening to him.Overall though, this was a great movie, which shows just how far the movie industry has come in way of visual effects and imagery. No doubt, the film - makers will ride on the wave of this films success by churning out a few sequels in the near future, and hopefully they will pay attention to what is really important and not be completely blinded by high profits and movie executives. The acting and direction is good, with Sam Raimi's vision doing justice to the long awaited journey of Spiderman from the comic books to the big screen.A rating of 7 \/ 10.
