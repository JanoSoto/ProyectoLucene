I also found myself comparing both films, and even though I enjoyed Superman Returns (I've seen it twice already) I found that the original was superior, and it wasn't because of special effects either. It was because it had more interesting characters, and actually contained more action. Talk about surprises.Christopher Reeve is the iconic Superman. I don't think anybody could ever replace him. Brandon Routh in the new movie was not the problem though. After watching the original film, I discovered that minor characters like Jimmy Olsen and Perry White were much better because they seemed to be more a part of the movie. Even Ned Beatty as Otis was much more interesting as a henchmen of Hackman's Luthor than Spacey's goons. And it must also be said that Margot Kidder was still a much better Lois Lane then Kate Bosworth. Of course like Reeve, I don't think anybody could play the role of Lois Lane like Kidder did.To continue with the other characters, Gene Hackman was a much better Lex Luthor than Kevin Spacey. Maybe it's because Gene Hackman had fun with the role whereas Kevin Spacey does not. Gene Hackman gave Lex Luthor a personality, but Kevin Spacey's Luthor is just grouchy and mean. Of course Spacey did make Luthor a much more evil character, but I still kept wondering where Hackman was to add his tongue in cheek humor to the role.Comparing both films, I found that the Original Superman was much more fun to watch. Yes both films add character depth to the Clark\/Superman and Lois story, but the original contained much more action that just zipped along and kept you entertained. Superman Returns was a little slow at times, but upon watching the original film I did not feel even a little bored. Even through there was a long sequence at the beginning of the first film before the excitement in Metropolis, I felt that Donner did all the right things to built the story and suspense in a matter that just kept you glued to your seat waiting for the good stuff. Singer does not have this with his film, and I also didn't like how much he copied from the original film to make the new movie either. I enjoy a nod here and there, but Superman Returns went to far with what it borrowed. It could've used a dose of it's own imagination. Superman the Movie had a lot of this.So my verdict is in. The 1978 Superman the Movie is the better film even though Singer's had better special effects. It also remains at the top of my list of super hero movies, followed very closely by Spiderman 2.

This remake, however, stands in pale (VERY pale) contrast in virtually any aspect one can think of. When the film opens, Gloria (Sharon Stone), a gangster's moll, is released from prison and returns to the home\/hangout of her lover, Kevin (Jeremy Northam). By the time she arrives, she meets a young Latin boy, Nicky (Jean-Luke Figueroa), whose family Gloria's lover has had killed. Seems the young boy's father worked for this gangster and not only knew too much but was about to tell all. Having believed her lover's story that there would be money set aside for her while she cooled her heels in prison, Gloria soon finds out there is nothing, so, enraged and knowing the boy's worth, she kidnaps him at gun point and off they go, on the run from the mob. Poor Sharon Stone trying SO HARD to match Gena Rowlands but constantly tripped up by a Noo Yawk accent that's often downright funny. Still, it's so apparent she's trying so hard that, throughout, you can't help but feel for her, a feat helped by the fact that she is obviously the only cast member who tries to create a character, though as written it's still the hooker with a heart of gold type, which is NOT the case with the 1980 film. In the original, Gloria is indeed a former gun moll, kind of ballsy but classy, never really hard-edged; here, as written, she's little more than a cheap, hard floozy. Jeremy Northam, a talented British actor, is slumming here, complete with laughable accent that rivals Sharon Stone's. As the boy Stone goes on the run with, and with whom she is supposed to bond with, Jean-Luke Figueroa isn't necessarily untalented, and in a better-made movie he might even be good; however, be it the dialogue or direction, he makes very little impact, a fact not helped by the lack of ANY chemistry between he and Stone. Bonnie Bedelia (as Stone's sister) and George C Scott (looking very ill, as a Mafioso head) are featured in small supporting roles but are essentially wasted. Sharp-eyed movie lovers will also notice the ubiquitous Mike Starr as a 'heavy' (he's the one who hangs on to the car Stone is driving); like character actor Dan Hedaya, Starr seemed to inhabit just about every film Hollywood made in the 90's, though here, Starr's part is strictly dramatic and not his usual comedic one. Behind it all is Sidney Lumet, a once-talented director who has helmed a few masterpieces in his time; however, whatever muses guided him towards those masterpieces has, in the last decade or two, abandoned him, for here he is again, delivering yet another celluloid stillborn. Not since 1982's The Verdict, with Paul Newman, has he given the world a solid success. He isn't helped any by a screenplay that manages to ape the original while making absurd updates and taking liberties that cleanly toss out such things as believability and common sense. For instance, at the end, Gloria meets with the Mafioso head and asks that she be absolved of any wrongdoing AND to have the kid. He agrees. And off they go, into the wild blue yonder. In the original, Gloria has to shoot her way out to keep this young boy alive. One doesn't have to be particularly wise to mob life to understand that a Mafia capo isn't exactly going to let someone with that much knowledge just walk away. I absolutely adore the original film; I think it's exciting, moving, thrilling storytelling. If you feel the same way, avoid this picture at all costs. I happen to like Sharon Stone; I think in some ways she IS underrated as an actress, though one wishes she'd choose pictures that didn't suck. If you like her, you may enjoy her performance, if not the film. She tries, perhaps too hard. But like so many remakes, this one's a bust in every respect. Stick with John Cassevettes' original and understand why they shouldn't have even bothered with this new one.

He's at is best when he's at the dinner table playing everyone but the kid. That is one of the funniest scenes I remember from any 1990s comedy. His humor is very crude in here (another PG-13 rating that is ludicrous) but very funny in spots, too. With that kind of humor, it's easy to go over the line of good taste which he does on occasion. Overall, however, Murphy is remarkable as all these characters. I believe he plays seven in all. This is probably his biggest 'showcase' ever on film, demonstrating his comedic talents.Even though this has a childlike-romance-type feel to it, and a nice message about bias against fat people, there are so many raunchy and downright nasty lines - mainly at the comedy club or the dinner table - that it's certainly not recommended for kids.

To me, that always seemed ridiculous because how could you accurately depict the true value of a 300-page book within two measly paragraphs? That feeling is exactly my reaction to Ridley Scott's overly produced and underly executed film, Legend. Throughout the film I felt that Scott had the potential to go anywhere and everywhere, really making this underground cult fantasy film bigger than The Neverending Story and Lord of the Rings put together. I felt this way because 80s fantasy films seemed to be less commercial and more imaginative than those released in the past decade. I was waiting for a stronger outing of Willow, but instead I saw Legend disintegrate right before my eyes. It was as if Ridley had 300-plus pages of material, but had to condense it all into two very small paragraphs. What ultimately happened was that we, the viewer, were cheated out of quite a bit of potential visuals, creative lands, and mythical creatures. We were instead handed a body of work that seemed to grasp at straws instead of development, weak heroic characters with an exaggeration on Curry's over-the-top Price of Darkness portrayal, and a finale that teetered on sarcasm instead of excitement.Legend, in my eyes, begins with an unsettling bang. We see no characters outside of a menacing voice that speaks in rhyme and talks about the end of light. Scott pulls us gracefully in by giving us these highly imaginative characters and a world that we think will be full of Hensen-esquire creatures. Alas, immediately after pulling at our dark sides, he slaps us in the face with what seems like an hour of pointless drivel with conversation between the Princess Lilly and her man-boy Jack (played by Mia Sara and Tom Cruise respectively). Caught between horrid writing, unfamiliar past experiences, and a uni-brow the size of Kansas on Cruise's face, we are left with nothing to do except wait. With the promise of unicorns and a possible dark future, we wait. The unicorns finally appear and darkness does become momentarily triumphant, but what never brings us back to that immediate opening of dark delight is that Scott never recreates it for us. Legend fails, not just because of the shallow acting, but because the story never quite hits the momentum it had at the beginning of the film. While this critic blames Ridley's choice of Sara and Cruise as our guides, I do think he could have strengthened the story to be a bit more energetic and sweeping. I felt trapped throughout this story, as if the walls that contained Princess Lilly were the actual boundaries of the film. This hurt Legend. Unlike other fantasy films of this nature, the walls of a structure may encase our hero, but we know there are bigger and more exotic things happening around the fictional planet. With Legend, I never felt that. I felt as if Scott kept us on a lighted path without the comfort or luxury of any outside imagination. I needed, maybe even wanted, to see more of this planet Scott created, but the door was shut abruptly in my face.I would like to state again that I thought Scott had good intentions with this film, but the final result (either from its original bad screenings to the infamous director's cut) just didn't feel like it was worth the two hours one had to put into the movie. Scott had some (I stress some) moment of excitement, moments of imagination, and moments of sheer fantasy, but they were all clouded by the brazen push of over-the-top melodrama and visions. What makes most fantasy films work is that you care both for the story as well as the characters. In Legend, the story seems weak because we care nothing for the characters. Cruise's portrayal of Jack could have been done by anyone who passed Acting 101, while Curry does give the BEST performance of the film, it is another case of anyone-itis. Without the horns or the bold eyes, anyone could have been underneath the mask. Curry did great, but take him out of the costume and ask the question, does he stand-alone? Follow this up with some elves and dwarfs that seemed more cliché than original, and the final result is an ill-fated Legend. I wanted to like this film. I knew about the cult-ish status of Scott's fantasy attempt, but in the end, I felt bored instead of moved by the overall picture.Overall, I cannot recommend a second viewing to this film. I went in expecting a larger-than-life Willow or Neverending Story (or at least enough darkness to counter Alien or Blade Runner), but instead finished the film thinking that in today's standards this would have counted as a direct to video release. Scott, as well as his brother, are fabulous directors and continue to push the boundaries on modern cinema, but Legend failed. Legend failed because of the story as well as the acting. Both were not in place, therefore, both could not work together. During the commentary, Scott mentions his passion for Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, but it was obvious that he was just name-dropping to gain film critic's respect. Legend, if anything, insults Cocteau's masterpiece. From the wrongly used word of the title (not a legend but a fairy-tale), to Cruise's uni-brow, to the cheaply forgettable ending, Legend didn't impress and it would be very difficult to sit through another viewing without some cash in hand.Grade ** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"2 July 2006","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" In school you are sometimes asked to summarize extremely lengthy books into one or two sentences to evaluate your knowledge on that certain piece of literature.

Even before she becomes a free woman midway through the film, Mammy is dignity personified. She is also pragmatic and bursting with common sense. Only she can prevail upon the headstrong Scarlett in every area (except matters of the heart).I've long been convinced the scene that won for Hattie McDaniel the Oscar she so well deserved is the staircase scene with Melanie, who she's summoned to console Rhett. Rhett has said earlier that Mammy is one of the few people whose respect I'd like to have. By the film's end, he has it, and so do we.

Superman is reluctant at first, but then agrees to do it. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor has returned and he has created a new villain for Superman to fight...Nuclear Man. Superman IV has a weak plot, weak acting, and is a very anti-climatic ending to the Superman series.Everything that the first movie did right is done wrong. The action is very trite, and not exciting to watch at all. The romantic subplot...There is none. Lois Lane has shrunk to a nothing character, while a new pointless love interest played by veteran TV movie actress Merial Hemingway tries to steal Superman's heart. Even the return of Lex Luthor couldn't save this movie. He becomes a secondary, pointless character, with none of the wit he had before. The special effects are actually worse than the first film, which makes this movie laughable. The Nuclear Man is a stupid villain that serves no purpose but to cause Superman a minor annoyance. The biggest problem this movie had was that it was way too preachy. The cast might as well have held their hands to their hearts and sang God Bless America.The acting is ridiculously bad. Christopher Reeve seems fed up in the role that made him famous, because he doesn't seem to try anymore. Gene Hackman plays the role of Lex Luthor the same as always, so I'll blame the script for his inadequacies. Mark Pillow (Nuclear Man) is so unbearable that I almost left the rooms during fight scenes.Overall, avoid this movie at all costs. That's all I can say.

After going to see Snatch, which treads similar ground to Lock Stock, I decided that Mr Ritchie was a Johnny-One-Note.That first note, however, was a good'un. Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels is NOT a great movie. I daresay that in 20 or 30 year's time it will look horribly dated and the dialogue will require subtitling. The pop-video direction and editing will also mark it as the work of another 90's-era hack director making the transition into proper cinema.On the plus side, the viewer is treated to a very humorous script and a bizarre view of the hinterland where ordinary folk rub along with the criminal classes. Mr Ritchie succeeds in creating a world where all the characters seem to talk like Del Boy without it getting on yer bleedin' tits after the first half hour. In fact, the movie marks the point where everyone who lived and worked in London began dropping their aitches wholesale. Within weeks of the film's release, all the corporate City types in the coffee shops and pubs around the Lloyds Building had gone from Oxford English to sounding like Big Chris and Nick the Greek. You can't buy a cultural impact like that, although the producers of Snatch gave it a go.A fine cast puts meat on the bones of their characters, with the exception of one Jason Statham. Mr Statham plays a slab of beef, a role that he was asked to reprise (and did so willingly, it seems) in Snatch. There is also a leaden cameo from the partner of one of the film's producers, none other than Sting. Bearing in mind this guy's energetic and unhinged turns in films like Dune and Brimstone and Treacle, Sting's performance here is phoned in.Lock Stock was such a hit and such an influential and innovative movie that it set off a tidal wave of derivative and mostly inferior Brit gangster flicks that took about 6 years to peter out.

Even though this movie is an old movie it is still very good which teaches a moral that even though you are old you still have to still act like a kid once in awhile. This movie gives a very lively scenes which makes one imagine themselves as a kid again. For example how kids use to love to play with toys instead of now playing computers and watching television, but this movie shows that no matter how old one is they should still not be to serious sometimes and enjoy life. i think that tom hanks did a well job playing the role of being in a man's body but acting like a kid and i think acting like a kid is a really fun thing to do when your a 30 year old man because it brings back memories of how adults live their life now all serious and barely having much fun like how they use to when they were kids.

I actually didn't want to write a review on this film for quite some time, because it was hard to grasp all the layers of the film, and believe me, there are many. Needless to say, though, this is one of my all-time favorite films, and it is truly a novel experience in film-making.If you haven't seen the film, the plot goes like this Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pierce) is an amnesiac. Ever since an intruder broke into his home and murdered his wife (played by Jorja Fox), knocking him unconscious in the process (or so he would like to believe), Leonard is cursed with a fragmented and quickly-disappearing memory. He can remember everything that happened prior to the event, but everything that happens afterwards quickly fades away, unless Leonard writes a note about it. Throughout the course of the film, Leonard interacts with a variety of individuals in the search for the man who killed his wife, and in addition, an extraneous plot (from the audience's perspective for most of the film, anyway) occurs with Leonard remembering flashbacks about an insurance salesman named Sammy Jenkins.It's hard to understand the film, especially since it progresses in a non-linear fashion. The movie runs backwards, in that it shows a scene, then the scene prior to that one, then the scene prior to that one, and so on. It is difficult for the audience to understand what is going on, but it's possible that we are feeling the same way as Leonard confused and disoriented. Even by the end of the film, some things still don't make sense, requiring multiple viewing to understand the motivations of all the characters and how they relate to Leonard.Personally, I don't think Christopher Nolan could have picked a better cast of actors. Guy Pearce does an incredible job of portraying a helpless and confused man who is never quite sure of what's going on, but by the end of the film, the audience realizes just how out of it Leonard really is. I also thought Carrie-Anne Moss did a great job as Natalie, Leonard's lover with suspicious motives, and Joe Pantoliano as Teddy, a cop who is playing Leonard to his advantage.It's a testament to this film that it works as well playing in a forward pattern (as seen on the Special Edition DVD) as it does when shown in non-chronological order, because it still manages to surprise the audience, and also shows how the other characters in the film manipulate Leonard for their own means.The audience is right there along with Leonard as he struggles to figure out what the tattoos on his body mean, who his friends are, and how he can solve the mystery of his wife's killer. The only trick is that the B-plot of Sammy Jenkins, and Jenkins' wife forcing Sammy to do a test on her, is the real cause of Leonard's condition, and is subtly hinted at throughout the film. This puts Leonard in a new light and forces the audience to re-evaluate their opinion of him.The directing and action are second to none. I think that Christopher Nolan realized that to tell a good story, you need a good plot, good interaction between the characters, and that you need to keep the audience guessing, something that is sadly lacking in many films nowadays.It is true that if Leonard has a memory condition that causes him to forget things, he wouldn't be able to know that he has a problem, but I didn't notice that until the third time I viewed this film, and by that time it was just a minor distraction. Unless you have hours to try and dissect this film looking for anything that isn't true to real life, there aren't any real plot holes or inconsistencies in the film.Bottom Line Without a doubt, this is one of the best movies I've seen. It's hard to explain, but if you see it a couple times, you will understand what the film is all about. Rent this when you have a chance.
