[{"date":"9 November 2004","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" When the US seizes Sheik Achmed Bin Talal, it sparks a terrorist threat where a bus is targeted with a fake bomb. FBI anti-terrorist head Anthony Hubbard gets on the case in time to find that a second bus bomb is not a hostage situation so much as a suicide statement. With the mysterious Elise Kraft floating around the edges of those involved, Hub tries to keep control of the situation but a further terrorist attack on New York City brings a great deal of political pressure to react and hit back &#150; even if the target is a network and not a country. With the military ready to strike anything they are told to and the Muslim community keen to help however they can, tensions are simmering and ready to boil, Hub tries to stop the terrorist cells before they can strike again.I noticed this film be released in the UK in 98\/99 sort of time but never got round to seeing it despite it looking like a good action movie. At the time it seemed that controversy over ethnic stereotyping may have had a hand in making it go through the cinema pretty quickly and I know that it has never been shown on terrestrial TV in the UK &#150; not sure why, it just hasn't.The basic plot mixes politics with a more traditional action thriller type plot but, aside from having moments of interest in each regard, it generally falls down in an OK film that is muddled and simplistic. The action\/thriller side is OK and it also throws in some very harrowing scenes of terrorism that (at the time) must have seemed impossible to many viewers in the US (sadly in Northern Ireland we are far too familiar with terrorist attacks to be shocked by the aftermath of a bombing in a film &#150; we have seen it in reality for decades) but these moments are few are far between. Instead the standard thriller plot fails to engage because it never really gets going and has to carry so much else at the same time.The politics side of the film is muddled at best. First of all Zwick bends over backwards in order to show the Muslim community standing up to oust terrorists in their midst and also showing New Yorkers supporting Muslims (oh that it were that way in reality in the majority!) but then the script also seems unsure of what it is saying. On one hand it is clever and critical, with Sharon representing the 1980's CIA who 'trained them to make bombs' and Devereaux representing a heavy-handed military using a broadsword for surgery but then we also have the problem where the film is very much 'lets get 'em' in its approach via the thriller route. It has moments that are interesting and insightful but generally it is all far too simplistic and never looks inward in the way any film that preaches balanced politics really should &#150; only a very subtle link via Sharon is a sign that the film acknowledges it may have contributed to itself being a target is a concession but it is one so hidden that those not keen to find it will easily miss it. In some ways it is interesting because, despite being rather simplistic it is still more critical than it would be were it made today it is still rather shy in being interesting and instead just falls into a simple thriller where 'good' Americans try to stop 'evil' extremists (although the only real reason they hate America is because they are 'evil') with only enough balance to prevent it being accused of racism. Without this aspect the film struggles because it tries to do it unsuccessfully but, as with the thriller aspect, it has a few good moments but not enough to really keep it going. The cast try hard but none of them are really served well by the material at all. Washington tries to be balanced but his dialogue is clunky for the most part and it is one of his less convincing performances and, given his recent remake of the Manchurian Candidate, I did wonder how he views this film now in hindsight. Benning is OK but her careful performance is betrayed by a 'happy' ending that takes away even the subtle interest she might have had. Willis is laughably bad in his character who suddenly becomes a big powerful distator of New York without any real reason &#150; I wonder if, made in 2004, this film would be brave enough to have such a criticism of the military's role in fighting terrorism? Shalhoub is OK but is really a big part of the film keeping the Muslim community happy while the support cast is multi-ethnic enough to stop it being too obvious in its subtext.Overall this is an average thriller and an average political film and it never really does that well on either of those fronts. The thriller side throws up an OK story as well as some moments that are all the more shocking now that US audiences have seen how real they can be, but it isn't that good a thriller. Meanwhile the film throws in a few subtle criticisms (although they look obvious in today's world) but not enough to cover the rather simplistic and muddled politics it peddles. Maybe worth seeing due to its increased relevance but it is not a very good film by any measure and is more notable for the targets it misses rather than those it hits.

","genre":"Action, Thriller"},{"date":"9 November 2004","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" John Archibald is a normal working man with a young son, a wife working as a waitress and a job in an industry that has seen a downturn and reduced him to 20 hours a week. With money problems already weighing heavily on their minds, John and Denise have even more to worry about when they learn that their young son has an enlarged heart and will die within months unless he has a surgery. Knowing his insurance covers him, John gives the go ahead, only to learn that his policy has changed and no longer covers this type of work &#150; meaning the hospital want to open a cash account for $250,000, an amount that might as well be $25million to the Archibalds. Appeals for funding, selling of every asset they have and appeals to the hospital still leave him short by tens of thousands of dollars. With his son about to be discharged to slowly die at home, John goes to the hospital with a gun and chains and takes control of the emergency room, holding hostages until his son is added to the transplant list and operated on.With 40 million people in the biggest country in the world unable to get national health care and the 2004 US electorate rejecting a man who offered to make it available to all in favour of a man who wasn't going to do that, health care in the US is a big issue and, for a citizen of the UK, a bewildering one. While the NHS is hardly brilliant, at least those 'have-nots' can still get good care even if the 'haves' can get it better and quicker &#150; so how the US can continue with its current system is beyond me, probably the fact that nobody wants to pay taxes for it and is happy to hope that it will never be them in that situation, maybe, I don't know. Anyway, as far as I know this is the first 'big' film that has really tackled the subject and in doing so it is worth seeing because, although it is very much exaggerated to support its own case, it still makes a strong argument and highlights the failing of the system to the people. However because it is making a stand it cannot help playing it to the hilt and really overdoing it. Still hard to really not share its view if you meet it on its own terms but this heavy preaching does rather detract from the rest of the film.Trying to do a Dog Day Afternoon with the issues, the plot cannot manage to keep the tension going and doesn't have the material to really do as well as it should have done. At times it is gripping, engaging and convincing but then at other times it is cringe-worthy, soapy, embarrassing and melodramatic. It is this way too often and it never gets close to being of the same quality as Dog Day Afternoon and at times it totally fails to hit the right notes and comes across as silly and hard to get into as a result. It still just about works but it asks a lot of the audience and at times I felt it was asking too much of me. A big reason that the film managed to keep me on board was that Washington tries as hard as he possible can to make the material work. Of course with the material he had his performance was never going to be perfect but what parts of it are solely down to him he does well. He convinces in his part and he almost manages to make the silly stuff in thee material work thanks to his earnest performance. Likewise Duvall and Liotta are pretty good but they exist on the 'thriller' side of the film and are not well served because this film never manages to be The Negotiator! They, like Woods and Heche all try hard but it is the overly preachy material that lets them down and drags the film down. Griffin adds a bit of comic relief but with everything else going on you have to wonder whether or not he was needed. Overall this was an interesting film that has a worthy point to hammer home &#150; shouldn't the richest country in the world be able to provide health care to its populace without letting them sort it out themselves? However it really pushes this point in extremes to the detriment of everything else. Trying to be a thriller is not the same as being a thriller and, despite having good moments, generally it gets slowed down by the melodramatic moments that don't work and some really poor dialogue in the script. A worthy message but an average film.

Seeing the public reaction to this bad cop image, TV producer Chase Renzi makes a deal to drop the civil case against the precinct in exchange for Preston being the focus of a new cop reality show. The search for a partner draws the attention of actor-wannabe Officer Trey Sellars; Preston dislike and contempt for Sellars makes him the first choice to be his partner and the two find themselves lumbered together in the show. However, this is reality television and very soon the reality of a criminal with a powerful and deadly new weapon at his disposable raises the stakes beyond what even the network could have hoped for.When I went to hire a video to watch for a night in, I was in a rush but was told at the counter that I could get one more out under their deal and actually save a pound &#150; so I just grabbed the nearest film with no intention of watching it. That film was Showtime and funnily enough it was the film out of the selection that I ended up watching. 'Why?' you might ask 'did you watch the only one you didn't pick?'. Well, it was a lazy and chilling Friday night in and Showtime pretty much delivers just what I needed by being quite fun but never once causing you to think or really engage your brain by being original or clever. The plot is basically the standard mismatched buddy stuff and the actual crime story is merely the set up and something that allows the story to have an ending to speak of. As a buddy cop movie it does nothing new at all but still manages to be fun even if it doesn't really have anything approaching big consistent laughs. Many viewers will be annoyed, considering what a high profile movie it is, that it just trundles along the tired old clichés and jokes but others will find it forgettable and basic fun &#150; I supposed it depends on your mood and you expectations.The cast is maybe part of the reason expectations would be high since both have had some success with the mismatched buddy genre before (Midnight Run and, to a lesser extent, Beverly Hills Cop). De Niro is always watchable but he is very much on autopilot here, plying his usual moody self without ever giving an indication that he was doing more than taking money and aiming for an easy popular hit. Murphy also wheels out his usual shtick with sub-BHC banter and 'that' laugh. Together they manage to have just enough energy and natural screen presence to make a mark despite the tired material but really they have both been much better elsewhere. Russo has nothing to do and is really just a distraction in a role that could have been better served with a less well-known actress in it. The cameos are mixed and this is best demonstrated by the presence of Mos Def and Wiliam Shatner. Mos Def offered me hope because he is so often the best thing in average films; sadly here he was boring and I was surprised he had taken such an uninteresting role. Shatner however is much better and steals the film from the other stars in his scenes as he wonderfully sends himself and TJ Hooker up.Overall this is far from being a great film, despite the budget and big name actors involved. It is unoriginal, lazy and rather uninspiring, however this is not to say that it is not some degree of simple fun to watch &#150; if the genre weren't then they would have stopped kicking them out some time ago. If you approach it in the mindset of looking for basic entertainment with no real expectations on it then you should enjoy it, however if you think that it will rise above the pack solely on the basis of being a high profile film then think again and approach with caution.

Seeing the public reaction to this bad cop image, TV producer Chase Renzi makes a deal to drop the civil case against the precinct in exchange for Preston being the focus of a new cop reality show. The search for a partner draws the attention of actor-wannabe Officer Trey Sellars; Preston dislike and contempt for Sellars makes him the first choice to be his partner and the two find themselves lumbered together in the show. However, this is reality television and very soon the reality of a criminal with a powerful and deadly new weapon at his disposable raises the stakes beyond what even the network could have hoped for.When I went to hire a video to watch for a night in, I was in a rush but was told at the counter that I could get one more out under their deal and actually save a pound &#150; so I just grabbed the nearest film with no intention of watching it. That film was Showtime and funnily enough it was the film out of the selection that I ended up watching. 'Why?' you might ask 'did you watch the only one you didn't pick?'. Well, it was a lazy and chilling Friday night in and Showtime pretty much delivers just what I needed by being quite fun but never once causing you to think or really engage your brain by being original or clever. The plot is basically the standard mismatched buddy stuff and the actual crime story is merely the set up and something that allows the story to have an ending to speak of. As a buddy cop movie it does nothing new at all but still manages to be fun even if it doesn't really have anything approaching big consistent laughs. Many viewers will be annoyed, considering what a high profile movie it is, that it just trundles along the tired old clichés and jokes but others will find it forgettable and basic fun &#150; I supposed it depends on your mood and you expectations.The cast is maybe part of the reason expectations would be high since both have had some success with the mismatched buddy genre before (Midnight Run and, to a lesser extent, Beverly Hills Cop). De Niro is always watchable but he is very much on autopilot here, plying his usual moody self without ever giving an indication that he was doing more than taking money and aiming for an easy popular hit. Murphy also wheels out his usual shtick with sub-BHC banter and 'that' laugh. Together they manage to have just enough energy and natural screen presence to make a mark despite the tired material but really they have both been much better elsewhere. Russo has nothing to do and is really just a distraction in a role that could have been better served with a less well-known actress in it. The cameos are mixed and this is best demonstrated by the presence of Mos Def and Wiliam Shatner. Mos Def offered me hope because he is so often the best thing in average films; sadly here he was boring and I was surprised he had taken such an uninteresting role. Shatner however is much better and steals the film from the other stars in his scenes as he wonderfully sends himself and TJ Hooker up.Overall this is far from being a great film, despite the budget and big name actors involved. It is unoriginal, lazy and rather uninspiring, however this is not to say that it is not some degree of simple fun to watch &#150; if the genre weren't then they would have stopped kicking them out some time ago. If you approach it in the mindset of looking for basic entertainment with no real expectations on it then you should enjoy it, however if you think that it will rise above the pack solely on the basis of being a high profile film then think again and approach with caution.

When her abusive and white-trash husband is murdered by hit men looking for stolen goods, Betty takes off to kick start her life and follow her dreams of marrying Dr Ravell and getting her dream job in a hospital by his side. When the hit men realize a witness has fled, they give chase to try and find her. The one problem is that Dr David Ravell, despite Betty's insistence that he is real, is actually a character on a daytime TV drama played by actor George McCord.Although it took me almost 4 years to finally get around to seeing this film, I kept meaning to on the basis that Neil LaBute's other films have been interesting. Bleak, but still interesting. Without an easy pigeon hole to put this film in it is not an easy view because you're never sure what it is actually trying to do but, despite this it remains an interesting watch. Trying to mix violence and comedy is hardly anything new (especially involving hit men & banter) but this film has much more interesting stuff going on even if it doesn't totally work. The plot is pretty strange and seems to be about people who think they know people but don't, then it seems to be about people who are lost in a world of soaps in place of their own lives, and then &#150; well, I don't know to be honest; where LaBute's other films have been easily put into a box about being about this situation or these type of people, Nurse Betty isn't so simple and perhaps for that reason is a strange watch.The plot is OK but it matters less than the characters who we care about. This is pretty well done despite everything the characters are pretty well done with us feeling a lot of different things for them throughout the film.Betty is delusional for most of the film and I did get a bit tired of her and there didn't seem to be any more to learn after a while. Charlie and Wesley were more interesting but never really got out of sub-Pulp Fiction mode until late in the game. Outside of the leads every other character was really support and I didn't really see much past that level. Zellweger does OK as Betty and is quite convincing even if she isn't at ease with the character at times. Freeman is always assured and always a steady hand on a difficult film and so it is here; he adds layers to Charlie that could have been missed and his chemistry with Rock is effective even if the latter is just doing his usual stuff. LaBute regular Eckhart has a small role but quality is added in slightly bigger roles by Kinnear, Glover, Vince and Janney to good effect. All of them give good performances but, because I found it hard to really grasp their characters, I felt I missed a lot of what they were doing.Overall this is an interesting film because it has so much going on and tries to be so much at the same time. It has plenty to think about with each character but it never really comes together in a satisfying fashion. An interesting film then, and one that is worth a look but not a 100% successful one or one that is easily put into a category and, for that reason, might be one that annoys as many viewers as it wins over.

I was only ten at the time, and this was the first movie I ever saw that was both an eye-filling and a mind-filling spectacle. It was also one of only two theater-going experiences that I ever had with my late grandmother, and I always think of her when I watch this movie. It always takes me back to an earlier time in my life no matter how many times I see it.This is one movie that could only have been made in the post-Vietnam era, when Americans began to question the moral integrity of their country. How else to explain, in the opening sequence depicting the Civil War, the utter cynicism of the soldier who speaks with Costner's Dunbar character? Or Dunbar's later observation that there was no dark political objective to the Sioux battling the Pawnee? The scene in which Dunbar receives his orders from the mentally ill major also seems to speak of Vietnam, the point being I think that while an entire generation of young men was being cut down in the Civil War the West was being managed by those who were not fit for duty in the larger conflict. Maury Chaykin, in that one scene, gives one of the most memorable and haunting performances I've seen in any film.This movie's depiction of Native Americans is not nearly as politically correct as it may seem to those who watch it only once or only at a superficial level. In the very first scene depicting Indians, in fact, a Pawnee brave shoots one of the white characters full of arrows and then scalps him. The unrepentant villainy of Wes Studi's character, in particular, recalls the moral simplicity of countless earlier Westerns.Even the most sympathetic Indian character in the movie, Kicking Bird, is not kind to Dunbar merely to be friendly but because he believes he can get useful information out of the white soldier about the other whites who are encroaching on Sioux territory. The interaction between Dunbar and the Sioux is powerfully effective precisely because the Sioux remain true to themselves. They are not cartoonishly hostile like the Indians depicted in old Westerns, but they are not soft or naïve either. While this movie draws its inspiration from American epics as diverse as The Birth of a Nation (1915) and The Searchers (1956), its originality lies not only in its respect for Native Americans but also in its intensely personal treatment of the main character. Few other three-hour epics (Lawrence of Arabia and Braveheart come to mind ) have developed their protagonists as fully and dynamically as this movie develops Costner's Dunbar character.Even after fourteen years, the Dunbar character's arc, going from a suicidal soldier in the opening sequence to an adopted Sioux who in the final scenes puts the needs of his people ahead of his own, is still one of the most remarkable I've seen in any movie. Costner's performance won no awards that I know of, but it provides the movie's indispensably tight focus. He's completely convincing every step of the way, if a bit too clumsy and self-effacing at times, hitting his head in the dark and fainting after a confrontation in a heavy-handed attempt to demystify the West.Another quality this movie shares with The Searchers is that it associates the physical challenges of the frontier with the testing of the soul. The Dunbar character cleans out the watering hole at the fort because he refuses to lose his humanity like the men before him who abandoned the fort. Later he cannot decide whether he feel more or less at home in the presence of the Sioux, because he is struggling to remain true to himself even as he remains unsure of who he is.This movie probably disappoints viewers who are looking for sheer entertainment. It's a quiet, thoughtful story, and although there is action in it the focus is on how the action transforms the characters (particularly Dunbar) rather than on the action itself. You won't see any computer-generated comic-book characters in this movie, but you will see real people having real conversations, and you'll see Costner and costar Mary McDonnell engaging in such intimate and convincing love scenes that you'll forget they're acting!If I could rate the musical score for this movie by itself I'd give it a perfect 10, because it's one of the best I've ever heard, able to stand on its own but fitting the movie like a glove. It is sentimental without being schmaltzy, noble without being pretentious. Best of all, it captures the hesitant emotions of the story, the sense of curiosity overcoming fear and becoming trust.Only this movie's extreme length works against its total success, particularly in the special edition that runs nearly four hours. The three-hour theatrical version is still long, but it's difficult to say what should have been left out of it.Some people still resent the fact that Costner won the Best Director Oscar over Scorcese's Goodfellas. There's no question that Scorcese is the better director, but I believe the direction of Dances With Wolves is better than that of Goodfellas. If you disagree with me try this test imagine that Scorcese did this movie, and Costner directed Goodfellas. It's a question of which directing job is better, not which director is better.Unlike most epics, this movie ends exactly as it should. The final images, such as the journal floating down the river, the white man and the Native American speaking English to each other, and the brave shouting his farewell from the top of a cliff, are so beautiful and dreamlike that they manage to be both joyful and sad. This is a movie that looks into the very fabric of this country's past, and asks us to do the same.Rating 10 (Good job, everybody.)

(Or so he thought) A very obsessive fan who is also a nurse was following him, when he had his wreck. So she gets him out of his car, and takes her back to his place. He thinks his troubles are over. Little does he know, that the real horror is about to begin...Wow. That is all I have to say about this film. Wow. This filmed messed me up so bad. There is one scene in particular, that had my nerves going crazy for at least ten minutes after it was over. The best way to watch this film, is with the lights off, and try your hardest to put yourself in this guys shoes. You do this, and your guarantees to be at least temporarily disturbed. An excellent movie, and a must see.

But not only their lives change, her life is influenced by it as well. I guess this must sound incredibly boring to some people, but it really isn't.

The story is a bit too constructed but it is an exciting concept that belongs to the best of the 1970s disaster flicks. Of course the only real problem here is Leslie Nielsen who appeared after this in so many spoofs (playing it straight as in his former serious roles) All his scenes are unintentionally hilarious. It only (probably) works if one never saw Nielsen in any of his spoofs. The acting and dialog sound today as if they try to emulate a popular stage piece or TV sitcom. The disaster movies that immediately followed are very similar in tone with the exception of (if it can be considered belonging into this category)Jaws which has much, much better acting that didn't age one bit (Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are perfect in this).So this movie belongs to a string of big budget (mostly disaster-) flicks that played it heavy and more stage-like as opposed to naturalistic, low key or over-the-top but virtuoso (Hackman comes close but the script and direction definitely are in the way here). This is rather sad since this actually is a throwback to the 1930s. Naturalistic and realistic dialog goes way back to the 1940s. I remember Earthquake to be worse than this and The Towering Inferno to be just slightly better in the story\/acting\/dialog department.

Junge has taken part in the process of making a film out of his life, and even though it is a highly watchable film, it is not as good as I (and many others) hoped a film like this would be.George Junge (played by Johnny Depp) grew up in Massachusets. His family was poor and his parents were arguing a lot. When he got older he moved to California with his friend Tuna (played by Ethan Suplee). In the 1960's, marihuana was flourishing on the beaches in the sunshine-state, and it didn't take long before George and Tuna started to sell marihuana for a living. But George found out later that smuggling the mariuhana was going to make him more money. The smuggling is very successful until he gets caught and ends up in jail. In jail he meets Diego (played by Jordi Molla) who convinces him that cocaine is the definite key to success. This is when the story of history's biggest drug-lord really starts.When I read the plot for the first time, I hoped this would be a quality-film to place 'up there' with crime-classics like Scarface (1983) and GoodFellas (1990). I mite have been expecting too much when comparing it too such masterpieces, but the film did turn out to be a quality-film, yet far from a masterpiece.Right from the beginning of, Blow overwhelms the viewer with a way of story-telling that's heavily inspired and almost totally ripped off of Martin Scorsese's already mentioned GoodFellas...only it's done much better in the latter. During parts of the film it looks good, but I mostly got the feeling of haven't I seen this in a much better way, before?. But that's not the films most notable weakness...I think that's the running-time. During the first half-hour, the film rushes through long parts of George Junge's life, and it's not until George escapes from prison and decides to visit his parents that I feel we get the first scenes of the film, with good dialogs and character-portrayal. Scenes with involving dialogs is something that's absent through out long parts of the film. This is a true story with much to offer, so a running time of at least 30 minutes longer would have been nothing but positive for the film.When it comes to the acting, there's not much to complain about. Johnny Depp is the main attraction in his totally convincing role as George Jung. This is a very hard and risky role to play, but Depp is doing great. Other than him, I think Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths in their roles as George's parents, are the most impressive.

Night is how he never compromises his direction and the artistic rendition of the stories he wants to tell. This movie has some flaws and a glaring plot-hole. Why couldn't the aliens at least bring body armor when they knew that much of the earth is covered with water?The first time I saw this, I was really catatonic as Night is an expert in making his motion pictures solicit for the appropriate viewer's response and reaction. He is an expert in anticipation of action. Hitchcock said The terror lies not in the bang; rather in the anticipation of it.For example, watch the scene where Merril Hess has to check out the house if everything is clear; and then he disappears for a moment. Or the scene in the cornfield where Mel is in the center of a huge crop circle, and the camera has Gibson's POV... anything can jump outta nowhere any second.Second time you watch it, the film loses scare factor but it is still beautiful as Manoj Nelliyatu is always very good in framing his sequences. Watch the beautiful mobile framing when Morgan Hess is holding the baby monitor upward towards the sky. Or the medium close-up of Gibson's face centered in-frame in the final scene inside the living room right before the concluding flashback.This film can NOT be appreciated by people who have intellectual arrogance and those who claim to have cultured taste in cinema. But it is very entertaining, the pacing is good. And it's beautiful.The good thing about a movie with a screenplay that's NOT as taut as... The Sixth Sense or Back to the Future is that the helmer's DIRECTION stands out and you really see M. Night display his skill as a director.Great string music by James Newton Howard and I suppose a round of applause should be given to DP Tak Fujimoto (Silence of the Lambs) as well.

I hear Night would have wanted no CG in this film, but ILM did a good job too... and that final scene in the living room?

The step-son is put in a position where he learns of an attrocity that Vaughn is involved in, and it's up to the real father (Travolta) of the step-son to prove Vaughn is guilty and, ultimately, save his son.I found this thriller to be pretty average (5\/10) and kind of a downer. Travolta pleases the audience that just wants justice instead of entertainment, but maybe I should be blaming the director instead of Travolta. Vaughn's character is creepy as he should be, but again, Travolta in most of this film is a lot like a more responsible-sounding character from Pulp Fiction (the drunken scene when he goes to the bar and acts aloof is exactly the same from Pulp Fiction). The kid in this is great about acting scared and everything, but again, every kid that year was acting this way.I recommend it only for fans of Vince Vaughn because I was greatly disappointed by Travolta's performance (and hair...my god, what's up with those two tentacles of hair coming from his forehead in this movie?)

But the driver isn't just an ordinary psycho or a madman, it's a demon that has to feed on humans every 23 years during 23 days... If you want something scary and creepy, this movie is the thing you are looking for. People who don't like blood, dead bodies, heads being chopped off... better choose something else to watch.

It reminds me of my days when we used to go on hikes in the woods and we would sing the theme song with me in my little coonskin (it's fake for all you animal lovers) cap. I just cannot get enough of this movie. It grows on my every time I watch it. It is one of if not the best Robert Redford movie ever. He does a fantastic job in this movie. The scenery is beautiful and makes me wish I was there in that unspoiled area. The dialogue, though there is very little compared to other movies, is brilliant. The old adage quality not quantity fits this movie to a tee. There are numerous one liners that have been incorporated into my everday vocabulary. You cook good rabbit pilgrim. ....the Rocky Mountains are the marrow of the world... Watch your top notch. Watch Yur'n. I could go on and on. Each character is colorful in it's own distinct way, making even the most insignificant ones unforgettable. The theme music is both haunting and beautiful and I've been looking to buy or download the soundtrack so if anyone knows where I could send me an e-mail. Not only does this movie have great characters,acting, dialogue, music, and scenery, but it also is filled with action and has several interjections of humor. I feel as though this is one of the greatest movies of all time and the special moments you share with your family watching it, just make this movie even better. (A 9\/10).

The dialog was clever even though it was mostly disguised as ramblings about nothing such as the notorious conversations on Seinfeld. The cast was perfectly set as each actor\/actress did whatever they needed to do to get the job done. The one thing I found to be extremely funny was how soft Mickey Rourke's voice was when he was younger! I couldn't get over his clean cut appearance either. Man I guess too much money and too much drugs can completely change a person over time. It's a shame because I actually have always liked his acting even though he's not the best he seemed to have his own style which I thought was sort of neat. Kevin Bacon did fine as the same type of character in his Animal House role. The film had its share of ups and downs but it had a light-hearted ending and finished on a comical note which was fine by me. The plot was decent and while it didn't move a mile-per-minute my attention was always focused on what was going on. I'm often indifferent on Paul Reiser but this time I definitely have to admit that he did an exceptional performance as the relief of the bunch.Final DotMovies Just a sleeper hit.DVD Purchase Maybe someday.Rental I know a good idea when I hear one and that's a good idea!

I discovered this film during my teens, the 90's. I can barely remember what the AMC informer said, but I remember nonetheless. He talked about how much of an impact it made upon the musical film industry. It was an awe inspiring effort! Location, Austria was beautiful!I have heard some compare it to large quantities of sugar... Just a spoon full of sugar, helps the medicine go down. I can understand this point of view. To present my side I am a Judy Garland fan. I enjoy an occasional Barbara Streisand film, she can be a bit too much (small quantities). I enjoy most of the films during WWII and those following until the mid 60's and on, as well as the performers accordingly. After the 60's it becomes selective. Although, this description does not fully describe my tastes, I do fall into a certain niche. This film is everything that I enjoy out of a transitional period in history. Cinderella has been retold over and over. This incarnation is heart-warming. I can feel the love they shared. I will forever be great full to have been given the honor of the experience that is, The Slipper and the Rose.This week I was singing the songs while walking to the mail box, doing my errands, and making breakfast. I will leave it on the shelf for a month or-so at a time. Eventually, I feel the craving for Richard Chamberlain (Prince Edward) and Gemma Craven (Cinderella) to belt out Rainbows raced around the room, Don't let him know, why I must leave him, why I must go so far away, Position and Positioning, are socially conditioning, There's a secret kingdom all my own. With no vassals and no hassles and no Throne. Just two subjects, you and me. In our private Monarchy.It comes shining into view, When the one you love, loves you. Alone together, we will reign forever. In that secret kingdom, Where Love's dreams come true.
