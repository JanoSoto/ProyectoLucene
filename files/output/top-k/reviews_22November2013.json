The reasoning was because I always heard this one was only memorable because of the hockey mask and that was it. I finally decided to watch it the other night and I came away pleasantly surprised at how great it is.I will not spoil the story but will tell you this much, it takes place 24 hours after Part 2 and has a great opening scene. Unfortunately the pacing is quite off in this one compared to the first two and there is a little more back story to our heroine this time around. This means it takes a little time to get to the actual killings but once they start its great to watch. Shelly is also one of my favorite characters in the series because of his humor and of course for what he provides our Jason.I wish I could have seen this in 3-d like it was originally meant to because the kills in this movie are the most brutal yet. Between the harpoon and the handstand kill(which is very sick and pleasing I admit), this movie out did its self and helped set up the rest of the series. I can see why some fans detest this movie but I love it. Even though it loses its scare factor from part 2, Jason actually runs in this movie and jumps off of barns. He is more menacing but is still human and not undead yet. For the people who read my part 2 review and noticed I scored this one slightly lower than part 2 but noticed I said I like this one better there is a simple reason. The kills in this movie are great and its a more fun ride than the previous two. I believe this movie started the series into an attractive ride and focused less on scaring the viewer. But the kills are still just as shocking and as usual you cant help but root for Jason in this movie. So I give this movie a 4 outta 5. Watch it after watching the previous two.

It was the day President John F. Kennedy was shot dead riding in his limousine through the city of Dallas, Texas. With today being the 50th anniversary of the assassination, I have decided to review Oliver Stone's controversial film about not only that day in Dallas, but all of the controversy and conspiracy theories that have surrounded it from moment one. JFK is actually a movie about New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) who takes it upon himself to bring to trial the people he believes conspired to murder the president. He and his staff do not believe that Lee Harvey Oswald (played eerily similar to his historical counterpart by Gary Oldman) simply acted alone, and as it turns out everyone he talks to has a theory about what the really happened, but every time they try to formally question them the witnesses to conspiracy end up changing their view or end up dead. Garrison does bring a man he believes was directly involved, Clay Shaw (played by Tommy Lee Jones) to trial and tries to prove that it was all a big lie and a conspiracy exists. The acting is full of very recognizable stars in good roles, even though some are only there ever so briefly that it works against itself, or some historically inaccurate. Costner gives a heroic portrayal of Jim Garrison, whom I think represents Stone's view of the assassination, even though most people know that his real investigation was questionable in his grounds of prosecution, and that he was extremely obsessive about a conspiracy theory. The supporting cast is great and they are great actors, but some completely disappear even though they are all supposed to be involved. The screenplay, written by Oliver Stone and co-writer Zachary Sklar, is something of which I consider to be a brilliant mystery (something that works unbelievably well even though it really shouldn't) My major problem with the story is that both writers try to cram in way too many conspiracy theories. I myself do not believe most of these theories presented, especially when there is incontrovertible evidence against the theories Stone crams in. For example, modern computer animation by animator Dale Myers, ballistics experts, and even the evidence found in the Book Depository have proved the multiple bullet theory to be false. However, with these falsehoods in mind, the film does raise some eyebrows about some inconsistencies with the investigation. I hate to say, but some (a very small amount) of these theories could hold water, but we would have to fully research these ideas and think formulate our own opinions. Like I said at the beginning of the review, this movie has been called one of (some call it the most) controversial films of all time. Many critics and people who were there believe that this movie is very manipulative and completely full of falsehoods and not one shred of truth. I think that people have blindly seen this movie without educating themselves about either the theories or what happened during the actual assassination. Instead of blindly believing everything the movie throws at us, we really have to look into it and study it for ourselves.But the way the film is executed and filmed is what makes this a classic, and one of the reasons why it appears on my all time favorite films list. The cinematography is so amazing and beautiful that sometimes you question whether or not it's real (another reason why it seems manipulative) Director of Photography Robert Richardson uses the same kind of film stock and cameras that existed in 1963 and before to frame the story in the best way possible. And then there's the editing, which best sums up the feelings of the assassination, which is truly chaotic. The editing is so great in that it forces us to look at all the details and try to keep up with what's going on. Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia did a fantastic job with it and kind of set a standard for kinetic editing that hasn't really been matched in recent years. It also makes sense that both these areas won Academy Awards.Oliver Stone considers this film to be greatest personal achievement. I, in all honesty, would have to agree with his sentiment. Many think that Stone has tried to manipulate people to match his now ultra-radical views, but he does what a director should be allowed to do. I think what Stone is trying to do is present his anger and confusion about someone who represented the hopes and dreams (his dreams as well) of America being madly gunned down like that, in a way that is more personal and daring than directors and producers were willing to go at that time. Every director should have a view of things and an opinion to present, not to follow the norm or keep quiet.This film is amazing to watch and is one of those rarities for me in Hollywood, a film to challenge us, make us think, and research about what is presented to us. Some have and will continue to blindly accept what they see in this film and others as fact, which can be dangerous, but still, we have people who are smart enough to know what is true and what is Hollywood. For many people, the movie JFK truly represents the lack of closure and anger we still feel for what happened 50 years ago today.

I am sure there have been a lot professional reviews about this movie, but what I can add to, is only the way that I have understood it. As our man William Blake goes toward his destination so the scenes out of the train window glasses change from so called civilized world to gradually rural and less civilized one, we alongside the movie sink into a scene of inhuman, indifference and violence. The characteristic of William Blake in this story seems to be a normal civilized gentleman who at the end, changes to a savage killer in a world that laughs at the all human values and crashes the humanity by treating people as if they are either the slave workers, mercenaries, or if not fitted into their system then, someone out of the line who must be hunted down by paid mercenaries. Not only the title of the movie as Dead Man chosen by Jim Jarmusch, quite professionally, but also the name of the city as Machine or even other names, picked up quite carefully and meaningful, like the name of the Indian as (nobody), likewise the others, that have got impact in letting the audience sink deep into the movie's environment, therefor understand it better. I confess that this film confuse me what to believe at! as what or where the US is? Is the US a sort of the place that this movie describes?, being a violent, brutal and immoral or the image of the US should be some other movies like good will hunting or Charlie Wilson's War is giving? It is all meaningful that our character has ever even heard of the British poet William Blake, but at the end gets his influence because of the Indian character nobody keeps talking about the poet. The movie leads audience to the nature of reality in the US society, although it address the US in the beginning of the huge migration and settlements of that time, but the core of the society still seem to be the same. Although movie goes too far by exaggerating on violent scenes, like the part that the 2 of mercenaries getting killed by the other one and the details of the killing scenes, especially when they were talking about the way that killer had treated his own parents, by emphasizing on him raping his own parents, and cannibalized them, it transfers the treat and fear to the audience.it has a deep meaning, because in nowadays US society the rate of rape and murder is so high that is worrying for a civilized society. The part that William Blake goes to see the factory owner Dickinson, and the way that Mr. Dickinson treats him, as he is a piece of dirt, the director has professionally target many meanings and philosophical concepts in the movie to leave space for the audience to think and elaborate on the blanks of the movie rather than giving everything to them, so that scene can be compared to the now a days treatment of the capital owners in the society and the way that they treat the lower levels.

It is a nice set up and the fact Jason came to be because of a joke by the first films ending is amazing when you think about it. The story is nice and simple meaning the kills are what matters.I love the kills in this movie and the wheelchair kill is one of the best in the series.

Some of these kills are brutal by even today's standards which speaks volumes to how crazy it must have been to seen this in theaters and having a good time.

But the kill in this one is actually over kill and something your not use to seeing out of a 80's slasher. The pacing is better than the previous entry which is a welcome change with this one probably the best of the first four and maybe the whole series. Tommy Jarvis(Cory Feldman) does a great job in this movie even though he has maybe 25 minutes on screen at the most. Also I love the twins in this movie as their a nice addition to the cast. To think this could have been the end of the series. It does end that way but as well all know, Jason is a cash cow and even the remake did great budget wise.

This time around, Braddock (Chuck, of course) is just trying to live life one day at a time after the end of the war. He's informed by a kindly priest, Rev. Polanski (Efroni) that his wife Lin (Kim), who is Vietnamese, is still alive there. After all these years, he thought she was dead. So he travels back to 'Nam to reunite with her. He also finally sees his 12 year old son Van (Harrah). Ruining the emotional moment, there's yet another sadistic Vietnamese General, Gen. Quoc (Aleong). He hates Braddock - and also children - so Braddock has to not just get out of the country, but bring an entire orphanage along with him! Can Braddock do it? To us, this third and final installment in the Braddock trilogy is clearly the best. It's funnier, looser, weirder, and has a different vibe from the previous two films. Possibly due to the fact that it was made three years after the second movie and this time it's directed by Aaron Norris. Because it, honestly, didn't really have to be made, it has kind of an Eh, screw it kind of vibe and they just threw everything at the wall to see what sticks. Luckily, this approach is totally winning.Everything, perhaps in spite of itself, seems to work here Braddock showing his sensitive side, the especially dark Prerequisite Torture, the fact that Braddock's son calls him Braddock, the fact that Gen. Quoc is constantly screaming Braddock!!!!!, the Patton (1970)-like musical stings, Braddock's awesomely awesome Supergun, and many more excellent moments. All three movies had quality explosions, and this one doesn't disappoint in the blow-ups department either. Matching that are some top-notch neck snaps as well. The whole movie is loaded with that classic 80's violence\/silliness\/patriotism mix that's the hallmark of the Golden Age of video-store action movies of the day. It's incredibly addictive once you get into them (and since you're reading this site, we assume you also have got the bug, and we thank you).Besides all the on screen action, some of the dialogue is priceless too. Most outstanding, of course, is the super-quotable I don't step on toes...I step on necks line, which Braddock actually lives up to later in the movie. The music by Ron Bloom and Lenny McDonald adds a lot, and their Bruce Springsteen-meets-Warren Zevon songs add another layer of icing for the wedding cake of radness that is Braddock. Also adding to the list of Braddock firsts, this is the first of the three to be released on the Media label. You have to buy this movie on VHS for one very simple reason there is an amazing commercial on the tape for Braddock merchandise. You can get Braddock hats, T-shirts and sweatshirts. This commercial alone makes the tape worth buying.We love this movie for some very personal reasons. It's the first Braddock movie we all saw, and we rented it from our local video store back in the 90's. As a group of friends, we watched the movie, and two things of note happened we misheard the song lyrics in the beginning, and we imagined the ultra-gruff vocalist sang In the streets of Saigon, when my ass was king. So we continue to quote that (plus you can't deny it's true in Chuck's case - we just thought the singer was being a bit on the nose) to this day. And, somehow, another song was crafted. Sung to the tune of Don't Cry For Me Argentina came Don't cry for me Col. Braddock, I know that you're missing in action. (Thanks Ant). So clearly we have a strong personal connection to this fine film that you might not have. But that's the genius of Braddock. He inspires creativity. There may be a heavy metal CD in the works that's a concept album all about Braddock. It truly never ends.Nevertheless, this, the best of the Braddock movies, represents a fine end to the trilogy. It's highly rare that sequels get BETTER as they go along, yet the Braddock movies get absolutely no credit for bucking that trend. It might be the only trilogy in movie history to improve as it goes along, but do you ever hear anyone say that? No, of course not. So take a trip to the Philippines and watch Braddock work his magic, one more time.

Because it, honestly, didn't really have to be made, it has kind of an Eh, screw it kind of vibe and they just threw everything at the wall to see what sticks. Luckily, this approach is totally winning.Everything, perhaps in spite of itself, seems to work here Braddock showing his sensitive side, the especially dark Prerequisite Torture, the fact that Braddock's son calls him Braddock, the fact that Gen. Quoc is constantly screaming Braddock!!!!!, the Patton (1970)-like musical stings, Braddock's awesomely awesome Supergun, and many more excellent moments. All three movies had quality explosions, and this one doesn't disappoint in the blow-ups department either. Matching that are some top-notch neck snaps as well. The whole movie is loaded with that classic 80's violence\/silliness\/patriotism mix that's the hallmark of the Golden Age of video-store action movies of the day. It's incredibly addictive once you get into them (and since you're reading this site, we assume you also have got the bug, and we thank you).Besides all the on screen action, some of the dialogue is priceless too. Most outstanding, of course, is the super-quotable I don't step on toes...I step on necks line, which Braddock actually lives up to later in the movie. The music by Ron Bloom and Lenny McDonald adds a lot, and their Bruce Springsteen-meets-Warren Zevon songs add another layer of icing for the wedding cake of radness that is Braddock. Also adding to the list of Braddock firsts, this is the first of the three to be released on the Media label. You have to buy this movie on VHS for one very simple reason there is an amazing commercial on the tape for Braddock merchandise. You can get Braddock hats, T-shirts and sweatshirts. This commercial alone makes the tape worth buying.We love this movie for some very personal reasons. It's the first Braddock movie we all saw, and we rented it from our local video store back in the 90's. As a group of friends, we watched the movie, and two things of note happened we misheard the song lyrics in the beginning, and we imagined the ultra-gruff vocalist sang In the streets of Saigon, when my ass was king. So we continue to quote that (plus you can't deny it's true in Chuck's case - we just thought the singer was being a bit on the nose) to this day. And, somehow, another song was crafted. Sung to the tune of Don't Cry For Me Argentina came Don't cry for me Col. Braddock, I know that you're missing in action. (Thanks Ant). So clearly we have a strong personal connection to this fine film that you might not have. But that's the genius of Braddock. He inspires creativity. There may be a heavy metal CD in the works that's a concept album all about Braddock. It truly never ends.Nevertheless, this, the best of the Braddock movies, represents a fine end to the trilogy. It's highly rare that sequels get BETTER as they go along, yet the Braddock movies get absolutely no credit for bucking that trend. It might be the only trilogy in movie history to improve as it goes along, but do you ever hear anyone say that? No, of course not. So take a trip to the Philippines and watch Braddock work his magic, one more time.

This time around, Braddock (Chuck, of course) is just trying to live life one day at a time after the end of the war. He's informed by a kindly priest, Rev. Polanski (Efroni) that his wife Lin (Kim), who is Vietnamese, is still alive there. After all these years, he thought she was dead. So he travels back to 'Nam to reunite with her. He also finally sees his 12 year old son Van (Harrah). Ruining the emotional moment, there's yet another sadistic Vietnamese General, Gen. Quoc (Aleong). He hates Braddock - and also children - so Braddock has to not just get out of the country, but bring an entire orphanage along with him! Can Braddock do it?

It's impossible to drive downtown and not regularly pass the Texas School Book Depository and Dealey Plaza.

The conspiracy theorists embraced Mr. Stone's work and even those who knew little of the Warren Report were swept up in the details and accusations. It was so easily accepted as an investigative presentation, and it was a way for the people to finally get what they wanted ... the answer to what happened and why.Viewing the film this week again for the first time since 1991, it's understandable why so many were swept up in the frenzy.

With a run time well over three hours, the only opportunities for an exhale come during the somewhat lame interactions between New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) and his wife (Sissy Spacek). Othewise, it's a very well written parade of movie stars that is exceptionally photographed and expertly edited. Newsreel footage, reenactments, and dramatizations of events successfully create a mind puzzle.

That makes sense if you believe defense contractors were unwilling to sit quietly as JFK pulled out of Vietnam. Was Oswald a patsy as he claimed? That argument can certainly be supported. More than one gunman? 5.6 seconds, a tree in the eye line, and smoke from the grassy knoll can lead to that conclusion.

","genre":"Action, Thriller, War"},{"date":"22 November 2013","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" For the people who are not aware of the concept and the style that Quentin Tarantino uses for most of his movies, Tarantino's films involve a lot of blood, violence, strong language and profanity and most of his films are not told in a continuous manner they keep on switching between time periods like Past and Present. Tarantino takes his style and concept and pushes it to the absolute max in Pulp Fiction and this resulted in arguably the greatest film he ever made.Pulp Fiction tells 3 different interrelated stories, with one main character, the first story's main protagonist is Vincent (John Travolta), the main protagonist of the second story is Butch (Bruce Willis) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) is the main protagonist in the third with Vincent playing a very strong supporting role. The film also includes a prologue and epilogue and these stories are also shown non chronologically. This film uses such a unique format, that chronologically the events of the epilogue take place just moments after the prologue and the three stories told in the middle take place before or after the events of the prologue\/epilogue. Pulp Fiction is one of those films that would have perhaps not been as entertaining if it had been shown in a chronological order, it's non linear format of storytelling is definitely one of it's highest points keeps the viewer thinking and interpreting. This is a major benefit because the viewer can just choose to watch one story at the time and still be entertained and will still feel like that he watched a short flick and there will be a sense of completion. All story's can also be re-watched chronologically to watch the film from a different perspective. The film can also be re-watched in the current order it is in to comprehend the film in it's entirety. The film's replay value is tremendously high, I watched it around 10 times and always found it entertaining.Pulp Fiction does not hold the viewer on the edge of his seat to find out what will happen next, but to think about what transpired earlier and what led to the current situation. For example Vincent and Jules went to do their job ,all dressed sup in suits and couple of hours later they go to bar to meet their boss in shorts and t shirts, at first I thought it was a glaring oversight but this is heavily explained later on and I was extremely surprised with the events that led to this sudden change of attire.The film's three stories are not that in depth or engaging neither is the overall plot of the film, but the plot is still funny, interesting and keeps us engaged throughout, the three stories also inspired by short films that Tarantino is a fan of, brands that Tarentino loves and B Grade movies that Tarentino likes they all appear, this is a Quentin Tarantino movie through and through and his fingerprints are all over it, he himself makes a cameo in this film, and despite not being a trained actor does a decent job. The dialogue is the film's greatest point, some really awesome, fantastic and memorable dialogues are spoken throughout this entire film that they are being quoted to this very day. This film does not want to directly take you into the action, when Vincent and Jules first went to do their job, they didn't get directly into they talked about a series of unrelated events which were all interesting to listen, they are criminals about to commit a crime, but to them it is just another day at work, they are co workers and friends and they are gossiping. Another example is Bruce betrayed Marsellus Wallace and killed someone, he is on the run but decides to smoke in the hired cab and discuss with the taxi driver in detail about what he just did. Another example would be us Bruce Willis going around his house's yard, rather than the film directly starting the scene with him entering through his house's front door, in the yard scene the camera focuses closely behind Butch to keep us on the edge of out seats and expect someone to attack him, although nothing happens.Pulp Fiction has many pop culture references and also involves some serious and controversial subjects likes miracles, drugs, mob bosses, taking dives, betting, homosexuality, rape all these subjects are depicted in the film. The soundtrack and full length songs that are used are really good and just are fun to listen, the main theme and ending themes are also excellent tracks.The acting is fantastic, Samuel L Jackson steals the show with his natural roles as Jules, John Travolta regains his former glory and fame with his excellent performance as Vincent, Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace was also great and Bruce Willis is also portrays the Butch character very well. There are many awesome cameos throughout the film where the actors deliver their lines and perform their roles almost perfectly my favorite however must be Christoper Walken's short cameo and the sentimental story he tells about the Golden Watch. All other minor characters like Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer also do a commendable job n their short roles.In conclusion, I want to say that Pulp Fiction is an astonishingly unique film which does not have a deep story and there is hardly any morale to the story but a tremendously entertaining film, with a fun plot, brilliant and absolutely mind blowing dialogue with tons of pop culture references and social commentary. It is simple a Masterpiece without a message and arguably Quentin Tarantino's best movie.Overall 9.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 November 2013","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" For the people who are not aware of the concept and the style that Quentin Tarantino uses for most of his movies, Tarantino's films involve a lot of blood, violence, strong language and profanity and most of his films are not told in a continuous manner they keep on switching between time periods like Past and Present.

Another example would be us Bruce Willis going around his house's yard, rather than the film directly starting the scene with him entering through his house's front door, in the yard scene the camera focuses closely behind Butch to keep us on the edge of out seats and expect someone to attack him, although nothing happens.Pulp Fiction has many pop culture references and also involves some serious and controversial subjects likes miracles, drugs, mob bosses, taking dives, betting, homosexuality, rape all these subjects are depicted in the film. The soundtrack and full length songs that are used are really good and just are fun to listen, the main theme and ending themes are also excellent tracks.The acting is fantastic, Samuel L Jackson steals the show with his natural roles as Jules, John Travolta regains his former glory and fame with his excellent performance as Vincent, Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace was also great and Bruce Willis is also portrays the Butch character very well. There are many awesome cameos throughout the film where the actors deliver their lines and perform their roles almost perfectly my favorite however must be Christoper Walken's short cameo and the sentimental story he tells about the Golden Watch. All other minor characters like Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer also do a commendable job n their short roles.In conclusion, I want to say that Pulp Fiction is an astonishingly unique film which does not have a deep story and there is hardly any morale to the story but a tremendously entertaining film, with a fun plot, brilliant and absolutely mind blowing dialogue with tons of pop culture references and social commentary. It is simple a Masterpiece without a message and arguably Quentin Tarantino's best movie.Overall 9.5\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"22 November 2013","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" For the people who are not aware of the concept and the style that Quentin Tarantino uses for most of his movies, Tarantino's films involve a lot of blood, violence, strong language and profanity and most of his films are not told in a continuous manner they keep on switching between time periods like Past and Present. Tarantino takes his style and concept and pushes it to the absolute max in Pulp Fiction and this resulted in arguably the greatest film he ever made.Pulp Fiction tells 3 different interrelated stories, with one main character, the first story's main protagonist is Vincent (John Travolta), the main protagonist of the second story is Butch (Bruce Willis) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) is the main protagonist in the third with Vincent playing a very strong supporting role. The film also includes a prologue and epilogue and these stories are also shown non chronologically. This film uses such a unique format, that chronologically the events of the epilogue take place just moments after the prologue and the three stories told in the middle take place before or after the events of the prologue\/epilogue. Pulp Fiction is one of those films that would have perhaps not been as entertaining if it had been shown in a chronological order, it's non linear format of storytelling is definitely one of it's highest points keeps the viewer thinking and interpreting. This is a major benefit because the viewer can just choose to watch one story at the time and still be entertained and will still feel like that he watched a short flick and there will be a sense of completion. All story's can also be re-watched chronologically to watch the film from a different perspective. The film can also be re-watched in the current order it is in to comprehend the film in it's entirety. The film's replay value is tremendously high, I watched it around 10 times and always found it entertaining.Pulp Fiction does not hold the viewer on the edge of his seat to find out what will happen next, but to think about what transpired earlier and what led to the current situation. For example Vincent and Jules went to do their job ,all dressed sup in suits and couple of hours later they go to bar to meet their boss in shorts and t shirts, at first I thought it was a glaring oversight but this is heavily explained later on and I was extremely surprised with the events that led to this sudden change of attire.The film's three stories are not that in depth or engaging neither is the overall plot of the film, but the plot is still funny, interesting and keeps us engaged throughout, the three stories also inspired by short films that Tarantino is a fan of, brands that Tarentino loves and B Grade movies that Tarentino likes they all appear, this is a Quentin Tarantino movie through and through and his fingerprints are all over it, he himself makes a cameo in this film, and despite not being a trained actor does a decent job. The dialogue is the film's greatest point, some really awesome, fantastic and memorable dialogues are spoken throughout this entire film that they are being quoted to this very day. This film does not want to directly take you into the action, when Vincent and Jules first went to do their job, they didn't get directly into they talked about a series of unrelated events which were all interesting to listen, they are criminals about to commit a crime, but to them it is just another day at work, they are co workers and friends and they are gossiping.

His mother is committed to a mental institution, and Andy is on his own with two people he doesn't know very well. He meets a teenage woman that is staying there named Kyle (Christine Else. Why she has a guy's name, I'll never know) Meanwhile&#x85; Chucky is resurrected when the manufactures of the doll want to cover up the events of the first one. Chucky wants revenge, and desperately wants Andy's bodyFor some reason, I preferred this movie over the first one when I was younger. You always have different tastes when you are younger, but I have no clue what the hell I was thinking at that juncture. This is by no means a bad sequel. As a matter of fact, it's rather fun at times. It's never boring, and always kept my attention. My problem with this sequel is that it was rushed into production when the first one was a hit. The first movie is not only highly suspenseful, but a great psychological horror film. This almost feels like a generic slasher movie at times. The terror you witnessed in the first movie is gone. Chucky is still somewhat creepy like he is in the first movie, but this is when he was really beginning to fire off those one-liners. I think they realized how popular the Chucky character could be, and they essentially turned him into what Freddy became, a comedian. I will say that they don't have Chucky commence an attack on Andy immediately or anything. It's decent psychologically for a little while ( I died laughing when nobody knows Chucky tied Andy to the bed, and Andy yells It's Chucky! I told you he'd find me! He's trying to take over my soul I crack up at that every time, don't ask me why) but a lot of things just feel padded and rushed in this one; for instance&#x85; How does Chucky know where to call Andy's school? And why wasn't there a more thoughtful search for better foster parents? The glaring plot holes like that, which the original didn't have. It was carefully orchestrated and genuine. This just screams Hey, let's make some quick cash off a sequel It's not filled with blood, but the gore is heavier than the original. We get a scooped out eyeball, an electrocution, stabbings. A classic death from a ruler (Miss Kettlewell was very naughty!) and a finale that is quite nasty at a toy factory. This movie has very little suspense. Unlike the original, which was filled with suspense, we don't get much here. I have to mention some pointless scenes, such as Andy trying a cigarette, or a couple of pointless killings. You could tell it wasn't as well crafted as the original. Alex Vincent has to deal with an inferior script than the original. He's adequate, but he doesn't have as much room to play with as he did in the original. He's still one of the more endearing child actors I've seen. If you wanna check out a great performance from him, see the original (I excluded Curse of Chucky, because I've yet to see it) Christine Elsie has a bit of trouble showing emotion at times. It's a shame, since she's fairly charming, and an everyday type of girl you can BS with, but she seemed like stone at certain points. You've got a doll after you, girlie! Shouldn't that account for something?! She was OK overall. Her chemistry with Andy is good as well. I just wish she wasn't so robotic in certain scenes. Jenny Agutter is OK as the Foster Mom. Gerrit Graham is a huge prick as the foster Dad. I wanted to backhand him silly! He played his part well. To be honest, the whole foster storyline was lame. I kept pining for Catherine Hicks (Andy's mom in the first movie) Grace Zabriskie is likable in her role. She's the zany mother of Susan's in Seinfeld, for those that don't know. Brad Douriff kicks major ass as Chucky, of course. The finale is probably the best part of the movie. It's pretty well done, and actually has some slight suspense. Unfortunately, it doesn't know when to concede, and it gets a bit OTT, with too many surprise scares. Final Thoughts Criticism aside, for a sequel? It's not half-bad. It's definitely fairly entertaining, and it passes the time effortlessly.

Some viewpoints about the film The film begins by a moving train. Train and railroad are symbol of industrialization and Americanization of the west. It is a show of violence and pollution of the technology. William Blake is going to the machine city; it is at the end of the line. A man who is speaking with Blake says some realistic points. When Blake show the letter to him and said he is going to take a job in Dickinson's plant, he said I cannot read but have not trust on Dickinson, paper, and everybody.

Gun governing is symbol of the American violence in conquering west and confronting with the Natives of the west. Western part of America in this film is the rich's arena. Rule of the machine town is Rule of the jungle; survival of the fittest. Darkness of the city sends these messages. This city in this film also portrays a gap between the poor and riches as deep as Mariana trench! Characters of the machine city are a good symbol of the frontier men who image themselves in the state of the survival of the fittest. They are saturated in violence as violence is their essence.

Jarmusch's portrayal of a dog eats- dog capitalist America can be read without much difficulty as contemporary&#x85;Dead Man is a radically subversive 'post-colonial Western'&#x85;.Several Native American film scholars have praised Dead Man for its 'authentic representation' of Native American culture especially the reconstruction of a Makah village has been certified as authentic(Ibid, 2006) Roger Bromerly (2001) wrote about this film Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man is a narrative which offers both a critique of the cult of the Western and removes that protection from doubt which has so long characterized the Western narrative. Some viewpoints about the film The film begins by a moving train. Train and railroad are symbol of industrialization and Americanization of the west. It is a show of violence and pollution of the technology. William Blake is going to the machine city; it is at the end of the line. A man who is speaking with Blake says some realistic points. When Blake show the letter to him and said he is going to take a job in Dickinson's plant, he said I cannot read but have not trust on Dickinson, paper, and everybody. Again he said about buffalo slaughtering by the American government.Machine city as an American dog eat dog capitalism Machine city is engulfed by inhumanity, pollution, corruption, insecurity, and inequality.It is city of the death and skeletons. Gun governing is symbol of the American violence in conquering west and confronting with the Natives of the west. Western part of America in this film is the rich's arena. Rule of the machine town is Rule of the jungle; survival of the fittest. Darkness of the city sends these messages. This city in this film also portrays a gap between the poor and riches as deep as Mariana trench! Characters of the machine city are a good symbol of the frontier men who image themselves in the state of the survival of the fittest. They are saturated in violence as violence is their essence. In one scene Cole Wilson, who hired by Dickinson is a cannibal to survival. Women's bodies in this film are an object for me. When prostitute girl is in her home and Blake ask about gun she says because this is America. Blake's fleeing to the west is a good opportunity for the director to give a new perspective of the west, especially an exceptional and fairly of the Natives. Dialogues between Nobody and Blake is a creativity by the director to note American and Britain colonizer's actions, and depicting natives suppressions by the colonizers. Consumer of the tobacco in the film is a hint to its importance in history of colonialization.Nobody is a mixnative, because of this matter he is not respected among his people. In this film he is a leading man who leads white man. He is Reminder of the racist Britain soldiers, who captured him in a cage and circleas savage In American cities and in the England. He went to school; again he reminds colonized people mimic sense. He goes to school or doing other things like them. When he comes back to west is labeled among his tribe as a liar. He decides to call himself Nobody, who talks a lot and say nothing. He elected to live in exile and under a new name. He is educated. Director of the film with some dialogues in native language and without any subtitle and a pure portray of Makaha village challenges the former western Film which has represents natives. Music of the film is an on time tools in this film.By Ali Hossein Torabi-MA student of American studiesReferences Bromerly, Roger, (2001) Dead Man Tells Tale Tongues and Guns in narratives of the West, EJAC 20 (1) 50&#x96;64 © Intellect Ltd 2001 Martin Gurr, Jens, (2006) the 'Native' Cites Back Post-Colonial Theory and the Politics of Jim Jarmusch's Western Dead Man, Anglistentag 2006 Halle Proceedings, ed.

Needless to say it made me feel the urge to watch John McTiernan's blockbuster. Mission accomplished.The titular vessel is a nuclear submarine commanded by Ramius, a hard-nosed Soviet Captain (Sean Connery in one of his greatest roles). While the sub is inexplicably aiming toward American seas, Ramius announces to the crew that they were assigned to conduct missile drills, but must we believe him since he's just killed the only officer on board who &#x96;besides him- knew the mission? Yet when Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst, suspects Ramius is planning a defection, we suspect he's right.But Ryan still has to prove his point and time doesn't play in his or in Ramius' side. During its long underwater journey, the vessel counts on its undetectable caterpillar drive system to travel unnoticed along the undersea canyons, but eventually catches the attention of Seaman Jones, a sonar engineer aboard the US patrolling submarine Dallas, which then keeps on the mysterious vessel's tail. Meanwhile, the Soviet government, fearing the eventuality of a strike against America, sends another Russian submarine to sink October.This is where the plot thickens; it takes a second meeting with the Russian Ambassador, before the Americans know about the potential threat represented by Red October, instantly caught in the middle of crossfire between American and Russian Fleet, both fires targeting her. And how Red October will get away from torpedoes coming from each side is one of the most exhilarating premises of the film which turns into a fascinating cat-and-mouse thriller and race against the clock with the Cold War as the perfect backdrop.And considering the political content, I feel like the title could have been Patriot Games as well. For instance, when Ramius exposes his plans, the crew chants the national hymn, their pride revived by the glorious military deed in the name of the Red Flag &#x96;ironically it's the singing that will be detected by Jones, that's how far the two subs came close one to another. USSR' credibility and American security are both jeopardized, to the point that the only patriotic move is to destroy October. After all, aren't Ramius' motives undeniably unpatriotic? And the resolution of that political and military bind doesn't only depend on the right tactics to adopt, but the capability to use them at the right moment. The feeling of urgency alone is not enough; sometimes a positive step can come from sheer good luck. To think that Jack Ryan owes his knowledge to a simple conversation provides a delightful taste of irony, yes, it's a serious film, realistically designed (although not as impressively as Das Boot) but it doesn't neglect the human factor as a significant driver of the most crucial decisions.And the mystery, the fact that we're never sure where this is heading up to, keeps our minds and hearts constantly hooked. Red October opens with a disclaimer stating that according to both America and Russia, none of these events ever happened, which enhances our curiosity. Connery seems to enjoy keeping a shadow a mystery one his role, although we hardly believe he's a bad guy but again, the film is not about his plan but the reactions it inspires from both sides, which if wrong, would lead to a disaster. That's why Jack Ryan's intervention is crucial.Jack Ryan gets aboard Dallas but her Commander Mancuso (Scott Glenn) wouldn't thank any chance and prepares to torpedo October, a process of four minutes, where Ryan only has two to convince him to give the benefit of the doubt to Ramius. Baldwin's performance is the film's hit-or-miss. Sean Connery is perfect as the leading, charismatic, yet enigmatic Captain, he exudes that kind of intimidating presence which makes you keep your guard up all through the film, but it's Ryan who really shines, as the average bureaucrat who conveniently knows better than anyone.Ryan is a former Marine, but from the way Baldwyn underplays him, he becomes an office worker, an analyst, whose intelligence and capability to anticipate Ramius' moves, are the only tools he can provide, and they are perfect within a military chess-game like this. Now, as much as I appreciate Harrison Ford, I'm pretty sure Alec Baldwyn would have been terrific in the second film, because he made that rookie-thing more believable, and his heroic involvement more appealing.The secret of The Hunt for Red October is to keep the right balance of darkness and enlightenment; enough to leave a complex plot with multiple layers of conflicts clear accessible to us. It features also obligatory heart-pounding moments, whether when the attacks against Ramius came from the outside, with the torpedoes' attack, or from his own crew, when he has to deal with the questioning of fellow officers, challenging his authority, and more seriously, some bits of sabotage that might undermine the mission.The visuals magnificently restored the ambiance of submarines' interiors (although the exterior shots were too blurry), maybe in a too perfect way, but it's easy to overlook these little details, the film again isn't a Cold War Das Boot, it's plot-centered, made of human interactions and conflicted situations. It does however confirm that the best military films are set in the Navy, for only a boat, or a submarine, can convey that claustrophobic entrapment inevitably leading to situations where life-and-death situation aren't all provoked by the enemy.Like The Caine Mutiny, Mutiny on the Bounty or Crimson Tide, The Hunt for Red October benefits from an intelligent writing, great casting (Peter Firth, Sam Nell are names to be mentioned too) and impeccable special effects, it's one of these entertaining thrillers to watch on TV during a stormy Sunday night.

I went for a walk afterwards and it felt cleansing to breathe in the cool night air after all the despair and hate of this. Much of it comes down to the play itself. It is bloody and mad, heavyhanded itself. A gloried general who puts Rome above his sons. A vengeful mother and queen who will not return pity when she was given scorn. A pathetic king, a monstrous moor, and various sons and daughters as playthings for the mad.It is clumsy in spots. The whole ruse in the forest with slain Bassianus must have felt far fetched to even Shakespeare. And a Roman general who slips out and returns against Rome with an army of the Goths he helped vanquish a few months ago? But overall it is powerful, gripping stuff because it's in the right hands here.The question how to visualize Shakespeare must be as old as the medium. The filmmaker here made a simple concession. Keep the original language. This means she can't film the metaphor, which would make a superb film of itself. Her brilliant choice was to create a modern stage for it. A Roman orgy plays out like a party from the roaring 20s. Cars and cigarettes coexist with tunics and armor. But the main thrust is still cthonic and medean.We don't have a calligraphic weave where character urges appear as encounter. But she has managed to address another, equally difficult problem of cinematic narrative. So many films are a passive exchange. What she has done in this odd way is carve a vital space for the story that avoids the pitfalls of both the usual period piece and on the opposite end the arbitrary imagination of something like the Cremaster films.It jars for a while but settles as a coherent world that is different enough to demand attention to it. It feels alive, freed from a historic stage, neither realistic nor without reality, puzzling the logical thought (why cars?) yet remaining implicitly recognizable for the eye.And yet it's all that rich, image-based language of the original that I find myself drawn to.In Shakespeare's time, plays were apparently performed with only bare essentials of stage craft. I know very little about him and the time, but this film surprised me enough to want to change that. Anyway, the word carried the cinematic stitch, the visual horizons. Here we have both word and stream of images, which may dampen the impact of the first. Yet I urge you to really pay attention to the word here, always in conjunction with the story. On the top dramatic layer we have sin and madness. Deep down, though, it is all about realizing what is truly vital and matters in life intuition, not structure. It is not the loss of queendom for her, nor for Titus the loss of prestige that truly hurt.

Wonderful, wonderful cinematic flows in words. It is not the word itself that appeals, the literary quality. The word carries the insight, capacity for horizon.

I went for a walk afterwards and it felt cleansing to breathe in the cool night air after all the despair and hate of this. Much of it comes down to the play itself. It is bloody and mad, heavyhanded itself. A gloried general who puts Rome above his sons. A vengeful mother and queen who will not return pity when she was given scorn. A pathetic king, a monstrous moor, and various sons and daughters as playthings for the mad.It is clumsy in spots. The whole ruse in the forest with slain Bassianus must have felt far fetched to even Shakespeare. And a Roman general who slips out and returns against Rome with an army of the Goths he helped vanquish a few months ago? But overall it is powerful, gripping stuff because it's in the right hands here.The question how to visualize Shakespeare must be as old as the medium. The filmmaker here made a simple concession. Keep the original language. This means she can't film the metaphor, which would make a superb film of itself. Her brilliant choice was to create a modern stage for it. A Roman orgy plays out like a party from the roaring 20s. Cars and cigarettes coexist with tunics and armor. But the main thrust is still cthonic and medean.We don't have a calligraphic weave where character urges appear as encounter. But she has managed to address another, equally difficult problem of cinematic narrative. So many films are a passive exchange. What she has done in this odd way is carve a vital space for the story that avoids the pitfalls of both the usual period piece and on the opposite end the arbitrary imagination of something like the Cremaster films.It jars for a while but settles as a coherent world that is different enough to demand attention to it. It feels alive, freed from a historic stage, neither realistic nor without reality, puzzling the logical thought (why cars?) yet remaining implicitly recognizable for the eye.And yet it's all that rich, image-based language of the original that I find myself drawn to.In Shakespeare's time, plays were apparently performed with only bare essentials of stage craft. I know very little about him and the time, but this film surprised me enough to want to change that. Anyway, the word carried the cinematic stitch, the visual horizons. Here we have both word and stream of images, which may dampen the impact of the first. Yet I urge you to really pay attention to the word here, always in conjunction with the story. On the top dramatic layer we have sin and madness. Deep down, though, it is all about realizing what is truly vital and matters in life intuition, not structure.

As is common with such films, the girls feel alienated from their parents and at odds with the adult world in general.As in real life, the characters sometimes turn to rebellion to voice or act out their dissatisfactions. They break all the rules and, isolated as they are in the self-contained world of the all-girls school, they create their own world, which they liken to Peter Pan's world of the Lost Boys.This is a coming of age story. But it is more than that. It is a love story that may be uniquely about teens or may be universal for all ages. Paulie, played by Piper Perabo, is a young woman with great passions. When she reads Shakespeare, she doesn't just read the lines, she relates to the desperation of the characters, especially after her roommate Victoria rejects her love. She admires raptors because they live a simple life and are compelled by nature to hunt and obtain what they need. Paulie wishes to become more raptor-like as she suffers the pain of rejection (and the pain of loving). Piper Perabo plays the part tremendously. I enjoyed watching her in this role, in part because I watch Covert Affairs and I enjoyed seeing her earlier in her career.Victoria is played by Jessica Pare. The other roommate, Mary, is played by Mischa Barton. Both play their roles convincingly, with passion.The headmistress is played by Jackie Burroughs. She is inspired in her portrayal. One feels that so many levels of her character lie behind her words and actions. In a small role, Graham Greene is notable, as usual.The film captures the disappointment of young people who are torn between loving and hating their parents. It explores the edge between childhood and adulthood, where roles (in society) are defined, sometimes painfully. And it celebrates the passion of all-encompassing love, especially by young people who burn so brightly.I enjoyed the soundtrack of this film. The direction was well done, bringing the viewer into the world of the girls. The only choice that bothered me was the ending. Not that it was horrible, but I found it distracting. I feel the same symbolism could have been achieved without the confusing move into surrealism.
