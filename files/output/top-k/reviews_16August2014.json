I sat down to watch this movie expecting more of what I'd seen so far from other Godzilla films, including massive battles and melodramatic performances, except on a smaller budget. I couldn't have been more wrong. The original 1954 film not only carried itself with the utmost dignity but it also came with a message that resonated socially with the Japanese population following the end of World War II. It begins with the mysterious destruction of some Japanese fishing boats at sea. The Japanese are terrified and an investigation is started, led by lead scientist Dr. Yamane (Takashi Shimura). The case brings them to Odo Island where they first come face to face with the menace that is Gojira\/Godzilla, a 160-ft. tall dinosaur beast infused with atomic radiation and an enormous thirst for destruction. When he begins to lumber his way to the capitol of Tokyo, the Japanese buckle down and muster what forces they can to defend themselves but nothing appears to faze him. Japan's only hope lies with Dr. Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata) and his research, if he can bring himself to share his terrifying new discovery with the world. And personally, I found myself let down by the whole thing so, Godzilla fans, please don't hate me.It's not that I demand mindless monster battle action from a Godzilla film. I can see the franchise took a major detour at some point and veered into some weird territory by the time it got around to psychic space moths and giant transforming robots. I love that the original GOJIRA is a more deliberately paced story with a message to share with its audience. My problem is that the movie was just too boring. At 100 minutes, it's just too slow to keep my interest. Maybe it's because I grew up with modern Hollywood and it's screwed with my attention span, but I doubt it because there are plenty of other movies from that era that I can still enjoy. The limited budget is quaint and I've got no problem with the production value. We can see the strings on the planes and there are obvious differences between the man in the suit and the puppet used for close up shots of the monster. It's cool. I just wish the movie had moved along at a better pace. Everything is very tense and over dramatic, and everyone seems to speak with a glassy-eyed stare and a lowered voice to emphasize the weight of the situation. GOJIRA is not your average monster movie. It doesn't revel in the mindless destruction of the monster stomping through town. It mourns it and gives pause to consider what brought them to this point and how it should have been avoided. Don't misconstrue it to seem that I have a problem with the movie's message. I actually really respect it for that and, as a result, it's got more going for it than any of the previous Godzilla movie's I've seen.But let's face it, if this wasn't the first movie of its kind (a Japanese giant monster movie), GOJIRA probably wouldn't be as fondly remembered as it is. I might respect it for what it is, but that doesn't make it an awesome movie. It plods along at a snail's pace and the film's pseudoscience is laughable (setting the precedent for all it's future sequels, I guess). Suspension of disbelief is an absolute must when you're talking about a giant mutant dinosaur with atomic breath but, come on, I'm pretty sure the film's secret weapon developed by Dr. Serizawa isn't fooling anyone. You don't have to be a chemist to see it and think to yourself, You know, I don't think that's right. I don't know. It just reeks of laziness to take advantage of your audience's (at that time) assumed ignorance and come up with a science-y sounding name for a weapon to explain your deus ex machina plot device to wrap up your monster movie. You can't have it both ways. You can't be a super-serious metaphor for your nation's fear of atomic weapons while at the same time feeding us corny science schlock. Your vibes conflict and it helps to kill my interest. GOJIRA is mildly enjoyable to this modern viewer and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves the giant monster genre. It's got a massive fan base so obviously there's something I'm missing here. It's got some real strong performances from its cast, the themes are intriguing, and the retro effects are fun but it's just a real drag with a third act that fizzles.

It's a biographical disaster drama with a predictable downer ending, but you see, how much, these men were so driven as fishermen. I think, that's the best part about the movie. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the movie is an adaptation of the 1997 non-fiction book of the same title by Sebastian Junger about the crew of the Andrea Gail, a swordfish boat that got caught in the middle of the Perfect Storm of 1991. The movie is very moving and edge-of-your-seat experiences. The movie is full of great actors putting their all into this film with their acting. You really get to see the chemistry between the Captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney) and his supporting cast of fishermen. George Clooney is believable, and you can honestly, see him in this lead role. He really give some great talk interaction with both Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Mark Wahlberg's characters. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is just awful, her accent will guaranteed to make viewers from Massachusetts cringe. Likewise, the relationship between Tyne and Linda Greenlaw was fictitious. Tyne and Greenlaw were barely acquainted in real life. While, it's clear that George Clooney is stirring the ship as the on screen lead. It's in fact, Mark Wahlberg whom get most of the screen time as Robert Bobby Shatford. The movie focus on his love-affair with Christina Chris Cotter (Diane Lane) more than anything in the film. Because of this, we rarely know anything much about the others crew, besides a few details just there to pull heart strings. Dale Murph Murphy (John C. Reilly) is a veteran fisherman whom divorced with a son with whom he's very involved in. Murph also has rocky relationship with crewmember David Sully Sullivan (William Fichtner) for odd reason, never explain in the film. They really make Sully look like hothead, and it's sucks that he don't know, anything about him, besides that. Then, there is Michael Bugsy Moran (John Hawkes), a member of the Andrea Gail crew, whom all we know about him is that he fix the ice machine, and can't find dates with women. The worst coverage has to be Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne), he don't know, anything about him besides that he can't speak English, very well. Honestly, his character was really just demoted to an extra. One of the biggest faults of the film is that the film focus way too much on the sub-plot rescue missions on a down Air National Guard rescue helicopter and the sailboat Satori with characters, we barely know about. The movie shows only have focus on the events that the Andrea Gail was going through. It felt like, I was watching two different movies trying to act like one. Don't get me wrong, the Satori and the helicopter mission was interesting, but I think, the reason, most people came to see this movie was to hear the story of what happen to the Andrea Gail. It felt like it was just running the run time. Some critics had a problem with the authenticity, that the movie change a lot of what really happen. They even add some action scenes to the film, such in the case of the shark, and the hook. Most names were not changed for the fictional film, and some families of certain crew members of the Andrea Gail sued the producers because of that, and that their names were used without their permission. The movie depicted Billy Tyne and his crew as making a very conscious decision to steam into a storm that they knew was dangerous, which is up to air, but also makes them look very foolish. No wonder, why the victim family didn't like it. The movie really did have some of the best special effects at the time. It was pretty impression to watch. For a PG-13, the film does have a lot of man Vs Nature action scenes that was scary to watch, because you know it could happen. Parents need to know that this movie has some strong sailor language and some sexual references that can get crude. For most parents, the primary concern will be the sadness of the movie. Like, I said, it's a downer movie. It's not really much of a spoiler, since the movie opens with foreshadowing. The first scene of the movie shows the wall listing the fisherman lost at sea throughout the centuries after all. Even the trailer kinda spoil it. It's a tear jerking man movie, so make sure, you bring your tissue paper when watching this. Another great high light of the film is the music. James Horner is like Hans Zimmer and Danny Eflman; they all recycle old themes of theirs and they never compose a truly 'Original' Score, but every score they do compose is always phenomenal to hear, either way. This is one of those. It's just beautiful to listen to. 'Yours Forever' written by James Horner and performed by John Mellencamp is just amazing. It's one of my favorite songs on my IPOD playlist. Overall It's an intense, real and emotional experience that just has to be watch to understand. Despite some faults, Perfect Storm is still one of my favorite movies of the early 2000s.

Overall It's an intense, real and emotional experience that just has to be watch to understand. Despite some faults, Perfect Storm is still one of my favorite movies of the early 2000s. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"16 August 2014","score":"","review":" The Perfect Storm is no way a perfect movie. It's a biographical disaster drama with a predictable downer ending, but you see, how much, these men were so driven as fishermen. I think, that's the best part about the movie. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the movie is an adaptation of the 1997 non-fiction book of the same title by Sebastian Junger about the crew of the Andrea Gail, a swordfish boat that got caught in the middle of the Perfect Storm of 1991. The movie is very moving and edge-of-your-seat experiences. The movie is full of great actors putting their all into this film with their acting. You really get to see the chemistry between the Captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney) and his supporting cast of fishermen. George Clooney is believable, and you can honestly, see him in this lead role. He really give some great talk interaction with both Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Mark Wahlberg's characters. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is just awful, her accent will guaranteed to make viewers from Massachusetts cringe. Likewise, the relationship between Tyne and Linda Greenlaw was fictitious. Tyne and Greenlaw were barely acquainted in real life. While, it's clear that George Clooney is stirring the ship as the on screen lead. It's in fact, Mark Wahlberg whom get most of the screen time as Robert Bobby Shatford. The movie focus on his love-affair with Christina Chris Cotter (Diane Lane) more than anything in the film. Because of this, we rarely know anything much about the others crew, besides a few details just there to pull heart strings. Dale Murph Murphy (John C. Reilly) is a veteran fisherman whom divorced with a son with whom he's very involved in. Murph also has rocky relationship with crewmember David Sully Sullivan (William Fichtner) for odd reason, never explain in the film. They really make Sully look like hothead, and it's sucks that he don't know, anything about him, besides that. Then, there is Michael Bugsy Moran (John Hawkes), a member of the Andrea Gail crew, whom all we know about him is that he fix the ice machine, and can't find dates with women. The worst coverage has to be Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne), he don't know, anything about him besides that he can't speak English, very well. Honestly, his character was really just demoted to an extra. One of the biggest faults of the film is that the film focus way too much on the sub-plot rescue missions on a down Air National Guard rescue helicopter and the sailboat Satori with characters, we barely know about. The movie shows only have focus on the events that the Andrea Gail was going through. It felt like, I was watching two different movies trying to act like one. Don't get me wrong, the Satori and the helicopter mission was interesting, but I think, the reason, most people came to see this movie was to hear the story of what happen to the Andrea Gail. It felt like it was just running the run time. Some critics had a problem with the authenticity, that the movie change a lot of what really happen. They even add some action scenes to the film, such in the case of the shark, and the hook. Most names were not changed for the fictional film, and some families of certain crew members of the Andrea Gail sued the producers because of that, and that their names were used without their permission. The movie depicted Billy Tyne and his crew as making a very conscious decision to steam into a storm that they knew was dangerous, which is up to air, but also makes them look very foolish. No wonder, why the victim family didn't like it. The movie really did have some of the best special effects at the time. It was pretty impression to watch. For a PG-13, the film does have a lot of man Vs Nature action scenes that was scary to watch, because you know it could happen. Parents need to know that this movie has some strong sailor language and some sexual references that can get crude. For most parents, the primary concern will be the sadness of the movie. Like, I said, it's a downer movie. It's not really much of a spoiler, since the movie opens with foreshadowing. The first scene of the movie shows the wall listing the fisherman lost at sea throughout the centuries after all. Even the trailer kinda spoil it. It's a tear jerking man movie, so make sure, you bring your tissue paper when watching this. Another great high light of the film is the music.

This is when Clark Kent has spied Lois Lane dangling from a helicopter atop the Daily Planet building, discovers that there are no phone booths in which to change in the modern version of Metropolis, and as he runs across the street he opens his shirt and for the first time we see the big S that stands for truth, justice, and the American way. The second thing I thought about was the director, whose name I forget, who was chastised by a friend for considering Reeve for a serious film since the actor had played Superman. The director's rejoinder was to stop and consider how hard it is to play an American icon like Superman (if you want more evidence of that consider how hard it is has been to cast the role for the 2006 film Superman Returns, and that apparently they have settled on actor James Caviezel, who knows a lot about playing a character considered sacred by a lot of people). Of course, the final thing I thought about with regard to Reeve was that he was never going to benefit from the tireless lobbying he did for spinal cord injury patients ever since he began the most famous quadriplegic on the face of the planet after that horrible equestrian accident in 1995.The tagline for the 1978 film Superman was that You'll Believe a Man Can Fly! but the impressive thing was that audience were willing to accept a relative unknown in the role of the Man of Steel. Reeve did not even get top billing; in fact he was billed third behind Marlon Brando as Jor-El and Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. Yet the whole movie hinged on Reeve, not only as the heroic Superman but as the purposefully bumbling Clakr Kent. Of course it was a put on and with Reeve it was clear, as it would become in the DC comics about Superman after this movie came out, that Superman was the real person and Clark Kent the faux identity (I also liked the idea that in addition to the glasses on\/off variable Clark and Superman part their hair on opposite sides).Richard Donner filmed Superman and a lot of Superman II at the same time and at one point it was apparently supposed to be one giant movie (think The Three Mustketeers and The Four Musketeers). But there is decidedly a sense in which Superman is three different films. The first, taking place on Krypton, is a solemn and almost sacred recreation of the events that led Jor-El to put the infant Kal-El into a spacecraft and send him to Earth to survive the death of Krytpon. The second, set in Smallville, Kansas, is pure Americana as young Clark Kent (Jeff East) has to deal with the idea that he was literally put on Earth to do something more important than score touchdowns, a lesson imparted by Pa Kent (Glenn Ford, in a wonderful bit part that deserved at least serious Oscar nomination).However, most of the film takes place in Metropolis and has a decidedly comic tone that is different from the first two parts. Clark Kent is a klutz, Perry White (Jackie Cooper) a blowhard, and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) cannot spell. Hackman's Lex Luthor has fun going over the top, playing out his grandiose plans to his dumb and dumber tag team, Miss Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine) and Otis (Ned Beatty). No wonder Reeve's Superman comes out of this one looking so good; he is clearly taking what is going on in this movie far more seriously than anyone else. The sequence in the film is when Superman follows up his rescue of Lois with a series of heroic deeds that go from saving Air Force One to rescuing a cat up a tree. Certainly this Superman has more of a sense of humour than his predecessors, although clearly in an All-American sort of way. The ending is big in a comic book sort of way, but all the larger than life stuff is grounded in the moment when Superman weeps over the body of Lois.Watch Superman and Superman II again some time to remember how good Reeve was in the role. But to honour his memory skip the third and fourth Superman movies. If you want more of Reeve then go check out Someone in Time (another instance of where his acting ability overcomes the problems of believing you can think yourself back in time), Deathtrap and The Remains of the Day. If you want more of the Superman mythos the first two seasons of Smallville are out on DVD, which connects nicely to the second act of this film, while if you catch repeats of Lois and Clark The New Adventures of Superman you can see the stars finally get uncrossed for the love triangle that was made up of only two people.

Or a dream.The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. Its hero, played by Tom Hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being too clever by half. Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role.I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.Forrest is born to an Alabama boardinghouse owner (Sally Field) who tries to correct his posture by making him wear braces, but who never criticizes his mind. When Forrest is called stupid, his mother tells him, Stupid is as stupid does, and Forrest turns out to be incapable of doing anything less than profound. Also, when the braces finally fall from his legs, it turns out he can run like the wind.That's how he gets a college football scholarship, in a life story that eventually becomes a running gag about his good luck. Gump the football hero becomes Gump the Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, and then Gump the Ping-Pong champion, Gump the shrimp boat captain, Gump the millionaire stockholder (he gets shares in a new fruit company named Apple Computer), and Gump the man who runs across America and then retraces his steps.It could be argued that with his IQ of 75 Forrest does not quite understand everything that happens to him. Not so. He understands everything he needs to know, and the rest, the movie suggests, is just surplus. He even understands everything that's important about love, although Jenny, the girl he falls in love with in grade school and never falls out of love with, tells him, Forrest, you don't know what love is. She is a stripper by that time.The movie is ingenious in taking Forrest on his tour of recent American history. The director, Robert Zemeckis, is experienced with the magic that special effects can do (his credits include the Back To The Future movies and Who Framed Roger Rabbit), and here he uses computerized visual legerdemain to place Gump in historic situations with actual people.Forrest stands next to the schoolhouse door with George Wallace, he teaches Elvis how to swivel his hips, he visits the White House three times, he's on the Dick Cavett show with John Lennon, and in a sequence that will have you rubbing your eyes with its realism, he addresses a Vietnam-era peace rally on the Mall in Washington. Special effects are also used in creating the character of Forrest's Vietnam friend Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), a Ron Kovic type who quite convincingly loses his legs.Using carefully selected TV clips and dubbed voices, Zemeckis is able to create some hilarious moments, as when LBJ examines the wound in what Forrest describes as my butt-ox. And the biggest laugh in the movie comes after Nixon inquires where Forrest is staying in Washington, and then recommends the Watergate. (That's not the laugh, just the setup.) As Forrest's life becomes a guided tour of straight-arrow America, Jenny (played by Robin Wright) goes on a parallel tour of the counterculture. She goes to California, of course, and drops out, tunes in, and turns on. She's into psychedelics and flower power, antiwar rallies and love- ins, drugs and needles. Eventually it becomes clear that between them Forrest and Jenny have covered all of the landmarks of our recent cultural history, and the accommodation they arrive at in the end is like a dream of reconciliation for our society. What a magical movie.

The director, Robert Zemeckis, is experienced with the magic that special effects can do (his credits include the Back To The Future movies and Who Framed Roger Rabbit), and here he uses computerized visual legerdemain to place Gump in historic situations with actual people.Forrest stands next to the schoolhouse door with George Wallace, he teaches Elvis how to swivel his hips, he visits the White House three times, he's on the Dick Cavett show with John Lennon, and in a sequence that will have you rubbing your eyes with its realism, he addresses a Vietnam-era peace rally on the Mall in Washington. Special effects are also used in creating the character of Forrest's Vietnam friend Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), a Ron Kovic type who quite convincingly loses his legs.Using carefully selected TV clips and dubbed voices, Zemeckis is able to create some hilarious moments, as when LBJ examines the wound in what Forrest describes as my butt-ox. And the biggest laugh in the movie comes after Nixon inquires where Forrest is staying in Washington, and then recommends the Watergate. (That's not the laugh, just the setup.) As Forrest's life becomes a guided tour of straight-arrow America, Jenny (played by Robin Wright) goes on a parallel tour of the counterculture. She goes to California, of course, and drops out, tunes in, and turns on. She's into psychedelics and flower power, antiwar rallies and love- ins, drugs and needles. Eventually it becomes clear that between them Forrest and Jenny have covered all of the landmarks of our recent cultural history, and the accommodation they arrive at in the end is like a dream of reconciliation for our society.

Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream.The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. Its hero, played by Tom Hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being too clever by half. Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role.I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.Forrest is born to an Alabama boardinghouse owner (Sally Field) who tries to correct his posture by making him wear braces, but who never criticizes his mind. When Forrest is called stupid, his mother tells him, Stupid is as stupid does, and Forrest turns out to be incapable of doing anything less than profound. Also, when the braces finally fall from his legs, it turns out he can run like the wind.That's how he gets a college football scholarship, in a life story that eventually becomes a running gag about his good luck. Gump the football hero becomes Gump the Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, and then Gump the Ping-Pong champion, Gump the shrimp boat captain, Gump the millionaire stockholder (he gets shares in a new fruit company named Apple Computer), and Gump the man who runs across America and then retraces his steps.It could be argued that with his IQ of 75 Forrest does not quite understand everything that happens to him. Not so. He understands everything he needs to know, and the rest, the movie suggests, is just surplus. He even understands everything that's important about love, although Jenny, the girl he falls in love with in grade school and never falls out of love with, tells him, Forrest, you don't know what love is. She is a stripper by that time.The movie is ingenious in taking Forrest on his tour of recent American history.

One prime question that was running through my mind during my viewing of Superman III was How could they screw this up so bad? Other questions, such as What were they thinking and Why didn't someone tell them this was a bad idea also popped up sporadically. When the two previous movies were a smash and had good stories going for them (despite limited special effects) you really wonder where things went so wrong. See, it's not that the third installment in the Superman movie franchise is bad...it's completely horrible!All the familiar cast members show up again -- from Superman himself, Christopher Reeve, to Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure, and even Margot Kidder, doing what can only be described as a brief cameo as Lois Lane. This time, Gene Hackman's brilliant Lex Luthor is substituted for a new villain (who is so forgettable, it's sad) as played by Robert Vaughn. The story itself is outright ridiculous, and I swear the script was written by an A.D.D. riddled eight-year old. Not only do we have Superman heading home for to Smallville for a class reunion, but he forgets his feelings for Lois Lane, and falls for hometown honey, Lana Lang (played by Annette O'Toole). In the midst of this, a Kryptonite substitute splits Kent in two -- one part good, one part evil -- which reduces to an admittedly amusing scene where Superman gets drunk in public and loses his temper. Eventually, he settles his differences in a Fight Club-esque manner -- which is more ridiculous than it sounds -- in order to make way for some more subplots that make absolutely no sense and go nowhere. From controlled weather changes, to a super-computer that merges itself with a woman, to a video-game being played by the villain against Superman, what happens in this movie is best forgotten. In fact, I'll be damned if I can sort any of it out. I started dipping into an insanity and boredom induced coma towards the end of it.Put quite simply This movie makes no sense. When it's not being outright cheesy, it just betrays the spirit of the first two movies. What a surprise, since Superman II director Richard Lester was behind the lens. Which still begs the question What went wrong here? This should have been a good movie. No wonder nearly twenty years went by after Superman IV before we got a new movie. Movies like this do no good. I only gave Superman III the two-stars because, for one thing, Richard Pryor was entertaining in every scene, and for another, because it was a thrill to see Superman burst into a drunken rage. If you thought other franchises such as Batman and Star Wars went awfully sour after a while, perhaps you should avoid this little turd.

Of the six major Universal monsters created in the talking era, Wolfie is the only one who never received a direct sequel. Instead, the sequel to THE WOLF MAN was melded together with the sequel to GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN to create this classic. As other reviewers have stated, it almost feels like two separate movies, at times. The first half of the movie is very much a sequel to THE WOLF MAN, beginning with one of the eeriest scenes in Universal history, as two grave robbers break into the Talbot family crypt looking for riches and instead uncover death by moonlight. This scene reminds me of the EC Comics that would come a decade later and is one of the best parts of this movie. From there, Larry Talbot begins a quest to free himself from his affliction, which eventually brings him to the castle of Frankenstein. You can see the basis of what would have made a spectacular sequel to WOLF had it been allowed to develop. That's not to say the end result is not, also, spectacular because rather than continuing Larry's quest, we begin our second half of the movie, picking up after the events in GHOST OF FRANK and culminating in a fight (sort of) between our two titular monsters.Like all Universal sequels, this one requires quite a bit of suspension of belief, along with a short memory in terms of what has come before in the two series. As has been mentioned many times, there were numerous problems with Bela Lugosi as the monster, ending up with no explanation for why is is blind and mute. The end result is a shambling, stiff creature who is the basis of every bad Frankenstein impression to come. There are confusing references to who created the monster and how much the Baroness' father had to do with it. Had the viewer not seen the previous installments, it would be very hard to figure out who the Baroness is and who created the monster. While we're on the topic of the Baroness, herself, her character had been played by Evelyn Ankers in GHOST OF FRANK, but as she also played Larry Talbot's love interest in WOLF MAN, Uni felt that would be confusing, so Ilona Massey takes over the role and, somehow, between the movies the character picks up a thick Hungarian accent. Adding more cloud to the continuity is the fact that Castle Frankenstein was destroyed at the end of GHOST yet somehow remains in place in this movie.All those things can be forgiven, though. What horror franchise hasn't played a little loose with continuity to keep events moving? I love this movie for the dark feel of the first half and the focus on a great character in Larry Talbot. I love this movie for the thrill it gave me, as a kid, in seeing two monsters in one movie. I love it for being a sequel two Universal movies in one.

Costner saying at least a dozen time It's nice being married---then the pan of his whole square face for 30 seconds so you can soak this in--leads me to believe this movie was aimed at women and Costner thought he was a hunk. It just made me want to barf every time he says it---it is like 50s TV verbalized or and ad for the Christian Family Values.It made me think my God has the world changed this much since 1987? Yes and no, this is star fluff from the 80s when Yuppie family values were king and so forth ultimately more irritating than anything else.The ending is so implausible especially the denouement when the judge suddenly changes the jury seems so legally implausible (the defense has a big say in jury selection) with Capone's incompetent (apparently) lawyer saying suddenly We plead guilty WTH?

I guess I have to compare it to the original, although it seems a bit pointless. While the film benefits from including several of the cast members from the original, the script is probably the weakest aspect of the whole production. Let's compare. The original had lots of humorous dialog from many of the quirky islanders and even added a bit of realism by often showing several conversations happening at once, whereas this one is flat and dull. Also, in the original, you can sense the strong bond Brody has with his family, with many little charming moments like the scene where he and his son make shark faces at each other. This one has nothing even close to that, except maybe when Brody hits his head on a low hanging lamp in their house. This movie also suffers from the inclusion of a bunch of annoying teen characters. Most of them have very little to add to the film, except to become damsels in distress of a sort for Brody to rescue at the end. Most of them have hardly any interesting character traits or even become shark bait, so there was really no reason to include so many of them. The original was the perfect Man vs. Nature film, but this one just feels like a bad slasher flick where barely anybody dies. To it's credit, this movie does try to have a real storyline involving Brody's dismissal from the police, not just the shark eating random people, but I would have liked to see more of that than scenes of the teens sailing. It's also nice that Hendricks (Jeffrey Kramer) has a more substantial role, and, to it's credit, it does have some nice shark attack scenes for undiscriminating movie monster fans. It's just nowhere near as good as the original. It may have been a bit better if Spielberg had stepped behind the camera again. Either way, while the original introduced us to the most terrifying killer shark in movie history, this one is little more than a cinematic plate of fish and chips.

Interiors is still a great film but an acquired taste and it did ramble a little at times and September is also good and was better on re-watch. Another Woman is such a beautiful film and Allen has probably not done a more emotionally affecting film, and is close to perfect. It looks gorgeous especially with Sven Nykvist's typically wonderful cinematography and the dark and surreal colours are also eye-catching. The music is some of the most understated of any of Allen's films and good thing too, anything louder would have spoilt the mood, the piano as the instrument couldn't have been a more perfect choice. The script is incredibly thought-provoking and reflective, as well as usually with Allen painfully truthful and the odd bit of subtle humour, and the story is very layered and told with much intensity and genuine emotional impact. It is by far the most poignant Allen film and the one I personally connected with the most. There's a definite Ingmar Bergman influence here, Interiors and September also did, but never in a way that feels ripped off, more of a homage if you will. The characters are developed beautifully and easy to connect with(compared to other characters in Allen's films), and Allen's direction has never been more intricate. The cast are all top-drawer but Gena Rowlands is stunning- one of her, perhaps her very, best performances- and her haunting narration sublime. Ian Holm is delightfully priggish and Gene Hackman is remarkably moving as a conflicted character, one that is different to other characters he's done. Mia Farrow's role is rather small but she is very restrained and plaintive and appropriately so. Blythe Danner also gives one of her better performances in one of her best films and John Housemann, Sandy Dennis and David Ogden Stiers give more than able support. The ending is somewhat abrupt but incredibly moving. Overall, a beautiful film and among his better films, and Allen to me has never done anything more poignant. 10\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"16 August 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Of the full-on serious drama films(Interiors, September and Another Woman), Another Woman is for me the best one.

Basically the period known as the Dirty War has concluded, in Buenos Aires lives high school history professor and well-to-do housewife Alicia Marnet de Ibáñez (Norma Aleandro) who is happily married to government agent and successful lawyer husband Roberto (Héctor Alterio), and together they have adopted daughter Gaby (Analia Castro). It is on the daughter's fifth birthday that Alicia becomes curious to know about Gaby's real parents, but her husband avoids the topic and tells her to ignore it, he obviously knows the official story of how their daughter came to be available for adoption. Alicia's longtime friend Ana (Chunchuna Villafañe) returns from exile, she explains how she was tortured and being held for having lived with a man labelled as subversive, and she tells of seeing children taken from their parents who are put in jail, Alicia wonders if Gaby's parents went through this also. Alicia searches for birth and heritage records of Gaby at a hospital, there she learns of an organisation searching for missing children, a woman there, Sara (Chela Ruíz), claims to recognise Gaby as her granddaughter, and says that her parents disappeared. Like other members of the Argentine upper class Alicia is not aware of a lot of killing and suffering has gone on in the country, her views are challenged by fellow teacher Benitez (Patricio Contreras) and some of the students, she does report a student, but Benitez protects him, the two teachers do eventually become friendly as Alicia's research comes together. Roberto meanwhile is stressing at work, with many of his colleagues disappearing, he is also confronted by Ana who she blames partly for her arrest, and he comes to blows with his liberal father and brother, and he is furious when Alicia brings Sara home to meet him. That evening Alicia surprises Roberto, telling him that Gaby is not home and saying how does it feel not knowing where your child is?, she does tell him Gaby is at his mother's house, he becomes enraged and assaults her, this stops when the phone rings, it is Gaby singing a nursery rhyme to Roberto, Alicia meanwhile gets her purse and leaves her key as she walks out, the final shot is Gaby continuing to sing, whilst with her adopted grandparents. I will be honest that occasionally whilst watching this film I found it a little tricky to keep up with, probably because of the subtitles reading, I dozed at one point and had to rewind back, thankfully I did get the concept, I can see why it rated well and won the awards it did, it is an interesting story based on parenthood, with a mix of trust issues, politics and human rights, a watchable drama film.
