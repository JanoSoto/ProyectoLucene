I wasn't expecting any major emotions for a setup like this(a guy is stranded and has to get back home) And didn't have very high expectations, but this movie just blew my mind with how down to earth and simple it was, yet how much heart and dedication was put into each and every frame. First, the positives that I praise are (obviously)Tom hanks performance as chuck Noland, a caring yet very serious and dedicated boss, and its very hard not to like him. He isn't a jerk, and doesn't boss anyone around, hes just a guy that wants work to get done. He travels on a FedEx cargo plane right after he proposes to his girlfriend, but the plane crashes, leaving him stranded on an island with no means of communication. His character is very believable and realistic, and is pretty hard not to root for. Aside from that, i have to praise how the movie was so natural and realistic, it had no music for the entirety of chucks stay on the island. I didn't even notice it, and it was amazing how well it was done. The special effects are quite good, but do falter occasionally, like when chuck sees a whale while hes on his raft, it doesn't really look too real. One of my favorite points has to be Wilson, his volleyball companion. At first, i figured there was nothing to him, but i found myself actually saddened when he drifted away from chuck during the trip off the island. There are very few things I have problems with, namely the time span of the movie. How on earth did no one find him in four years? He clearly saw a ship once before, wouldn't one have come there? It just bothered me the whole time. All in all, this is an amazing movie, and another masterpiece by Robert Zemeckis, who had the balls to actually consider this idea, let alone make it.

It was written by William Broyles Jr., the man who wrote Apollo 13 previously, another Hanks movie. Here the two-time Academy award winner is basically in every single scene from start to finish and that is especially mentionable as the film runs for almost 2.5 hours. Other parts are played by Helen Hunt and Chris Noth, who I really liked on Criminal Intent.Anyway, back to Hanks and the performance that won him another Golden Globe and almost brought him his 3rd Oscar. The first half hour, we gain an insight into Chuck Noland's life, work and family, especially into his professional life as a FedEx employee giving training courses in foreign countries. After the 30-minute mark his plane has already crashed and he made it to a remote island, where he fights for survival for many years until finally, after he decides to sail away, he gets picked up by a cargo ship. The last 40 minutes or so then take place back in civilization again and we see how he struggles with his now remarried wife and life in general. That was one of the very few parts that I did not like at all. If he is truly the love of her life, she also should get back together with him and there is no real excuse for staying married to Noth's character. I don't really need a happy end (it somehow was one looking at the very last scene), but if they make it somehow unhappy, it needs to be at least realistic, maybe they should have kept it without the two meeting again and just ended it with Noth leading Hunt's character to the car.Anyway, one of the best parts of the film is the constant approach to time, the way he talks about it before the crash and how he has basically found his peace at the end not trying to beat it anymore. Most of that happened on the island, where also the majority of the film takes place. We see how he fishes, hunts, tries to make fire, is thirsty etc. pretty much everything you would expect. And we also see Wilson the Volleyball of course, one of the greatest performances from an inanimate object in film history. He serves as a person being with Noland on the island, so he has somebody to talk to and won't go insane due to lack of human relationships.The title Cast Away is certainly not only a reference to him being on the isolated island, but also about everything what happens when he is rescued. There were a few moments on the island where I felt it dragged a bit and I don't really feel the need to watch the film anytime soon again, but as a whole I enjoyed and would recommend it. It came in 2nd most-seen film after The Grinch in 2000 and it is certainly a good quality movie with a stellar lead performance.

By golly, it is very strange and hard to figure out. I watched this film and when it ended I was pretty much like, What did I just watch? A surreal type film where it seems Lynch is taking us to a world that is similar to ours in many ways, but vastly different than ours in very disturbing ways. A place where life is just as normal and dull as a day in our own lives, but at times is an utter nightmare so horrid that those who live within it just wish for death to escape it. Still, one wonders what it all means as this film kept becoming more and more bizarre as it progressed. A very disturbing film that had odd bits of humor here and there and periods where one felt uncomfortable to watch.The story has a man named Henry. He is apparently on vacation and his girlfriend apparently wants him over for dinner. He goes to this dinner only to learn that not only is Mary's family very strange, but also that Mary has had a child...or perhaps something else as Mary herself said that they were not even sure it was a baby. Well, Henry becomes a father unexpectedly and soon his girlfriend leaves him with said child. He becomes frustrated and wants the neighbor across the hall, but is also drawn to the mysterious girl within the radiator who sings of heaven.At times, I have no idea what is going on, but at other I feel almost as if I do. When Henry goes to meet his girlfriend's parents it almost seems to me that Henry suffers from social anxiety disorder. That everything is being blown out of proportion by his condition. Suffering from this condition when I come upon things I am not used to and being around people I am unfamiliar everything seems to go wrong in my mind and the most awkward situations keep popping up. Like how he gets roped into carving the chicken which promptly bleeds and the mother runs out of the room screaming and then the father tries to have a conversation with Henry who is very uncomfortable at the moment. Then other parts of the film are just so strange that I am unable to figure out what is going on except Henry is becoming increasingly unhappy and frustrated. However, he seems to find relief at the end as the last shot of him embracing the girl in the radiator shows him having an expression of pure relief.So, this film was well done and is something that is up for interpretation. I do not find it pretentious as I feel a more pretentious film shows imagery that tries to make it look like it is showing something really deep, but in reality means absolutely nothing. Here, I do get a sense that there is something behind what is being presented. Lynch did an excellent job of presenting this strange world and I would almost like to see more of it as it is such a strange and horrific place. Henry's story ended, but perhaps another viewpoint could have been done at one point of this nightmarish realm that so mirrors our world, but at the same time has deep cracks in it.

Kazan, in his early 40s there, was already a Best Director and Best Picture winner at this point for Gentleman's Agreement. Streetcar got him nominations in both categories again, but no wins this time. However, the film won 3 of its 4 acting nominations. Leigh got her second Oscar after Gone With the Wind while Malden and Hunter won the supporting categories and scored their first Oscar wins with their first nominations. The only major cast member who did not succeed was Marlon Brando, who lost to Bogart. However, his next project with Kazan got him the win and Kazan triumphed as director and Best Picture winner again as well for On the Waterfront.Anyway, back to the film. With technicolor (Robin Hood almost 15 years earlier) being very popular already at this point, it deserves a mention that Streetcar is completely black-and-white. If you like Brando and\/or Leigh this film is the perfect treat for you. the two are really giving it their best and totally going against each other as if there is no tomorrow. Sometimes, it is a fine line between nail-on-the-head and over-the-top, but most of the time they do not cross it. Malden had a couple great scenes and Hunter was pretty solid in theirs as well. I need to see some of the other supporting contenders to say how justified the wins were, but I am fairly certain that I'm pretty much in agreement with the Academy, at least about Malden. His character's attempts to be a gentleman, but also a real man next to Stanley are truly delightful to watch. On a side-note, you may have seen Hunter in the Planet of the Apes-franchise or Malden in Streets of San Francisco, a 1970s TV-show where he stars together with the young Michael Douglas.Brando's performance pretty much stays memorable as the ultimate brute performance and wild untameable man in his 20s that only maybe James Dean came close to, if at all. Blanche DuBois will agree. He is basically everything she despises in a man, rough, uneducated, not a gentleman and very loud and brutal. We know that although the way Blanche's past looked in detail does not become 100% clear to the viewer. we do not know what was real and what wasn't. However, you have to hold in Kowalski's favor despite his despicable act near the end of the film that occasionally he is right. Blanche tries to antagonize her sister against Stanley, she keeps calling him a Polak, even in his presence etc. Apart from that, there were generally some confusing parts about Blanche.

Kazan, in his early 40s there, was already a Best Director and Best Picture winner at this point for Gentleman's Agreement. Streetcar got him nominations in both categories again, but no wins this time. However, the film won 3 of its 4 acting nominations. Leigh got her second Oscar after Gone With the Wind while Malden and Hunter won the supporting categories and scored their first Oscar wins with their first nominations. The only major cast member who did not succeed was Marlon Brando, who lost to Bogart. However, his next project with Kazan got him the win and Kazan triumphed as director and Best Picture winner again as well for On the Waterfront.Anyway, back to the film. With technicolor (Robin Hood almost 15 years earlier) being very popular already at this point, it deserves a mention that Streetcar is completely black-and-white. If you like Brando and\/or Leigh this film is the perfect treat for you. the two are really giving it their best and totally going against each other as if there is no tomorrow. Sometimes, it is a fine line between nail-on-the-head and over-the-top, but most of the time they do not cross it. Malden had a couple great scenes and Hunter was pretty solid in theirs as well. I need to see some of the other supporting contenders to say how justified the wins were, but I am fairly certain that I'm pretty much in agreement with the Academy, at least about Malden. His character's attempts to be a gentleman, but also a real man next to Stanley are truly delightful to watch. On a side-note, you may have seen Hunter in the Planet of the Apes-franchise or Malden in Streets of San Francisco, a 1970s TV-show where he stars together with the young Michael Douglas.Brando's performance pretty much stays memorable as the ultimate brute performance and wild untameable man in his 20s that only maybe James Dean came close to, if at all. Blanche DuBois will agree. He is basically everything she despises in a man, rough, uneducated, not a gentleman and very loud and brutal. We know that although the way Blanche's past looked in detail does not become 100% clear to the viewer. we do not know what was real and what wasn't. However, you have to hold in Kowalski's favor despite his despicable act near the end of the film that occasionally he is right. Blanche tries to antagonize her sister against Stanley, she keeps calling him a Polak, even in his presence etc. Apart from that, there were generally some confusing parts about Blanche.

I have not seen the other attempts, so I cannot say if I agree, but somehow I cannot believe that they are all worse as this is not a great film by any means. The first half I have to say was occasionally really bad. Flynn seemed completely miscast and the way he was written with all his cockiness, arrogant and boastful behavior it did not work out at all. Also the fact that he shows up to see John with all these soldiers around is not very credible. So yeah, the script did not wow me at all initially and I was truly disappointed with Flynn's performance. The worst thing, however, is the way he meets his future companions and his awful laugh. It gets a lot better in the second half of the film (the writing and Flynn's performance as both becomes a bit more subtle) and the movie actually becomes pretty entertaining. A lot of that is thanks to the two antagonists (played by the multi-Oscar nominated Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains) and to Olivia de Havilland.The film is directed by William Keighley and Michael Curtiz, who directed the classic Casablanca 4 years after Robin Hood. If you have seen the World-War-II classic, you will know that this is completely in black and white, while Robin Hood is entirely in technicolor. And that is the biggest strength of the movie. It is truly a feast visually. The costumes are great, the sets are simply wonderful and all the beautiful colors really make this film special. The music is fine too and the soundtrack is one of the three Academy Awards wins the film scored in 1939.So, as I already said, the second half is where the film really steps it up. The only scene I did not really like was when Robin goes to the shooting contest despite his friends telling him it is a trap. And of course, he ends up in prison right away. I am just not a fan of the heroic, but not particularly bright Robin Hood in this movie and Flynn did not convince me at all either. The film is a mixture of drama, costume piece, history lesson (Normans vs. Saxons), love story and comedy, although the comedy parts I did not find really funny at all, maybe because of the aforementioned hysteric laugh which I found particularly cringeworthy. Other than that, the film is a good example that you don't need heavy gun fights to include entertaining action sequences. The sword fighting scenes near the end was fun.Pay attention to how Hood kills Gisbourne at the end and not John. Gisbourne was the initial rival for him when it comes to Maid Marian and he also was the more sinister one. Of course, Prince Johnw as evil too, but I felt his wickedness had more to do with thirst for power and Gisbourne was the true sadist. The bad guys get what they hate the most at the end and the hero gets the girl and everything is fine. The Adventures of Robin Hood is an interesting film and I recommend it to watch for its visual impact, but it is also interesting to consider that when this came out the world was at really dark times, at least as dark as those in the film. And finally, a little snippet of information that Olivia de Havilland is most likely the only person still alive who worked on this movie. She stands at 98 currently and thumbs crossed she reaches 100. She is one of the standouts of the film and really lifted it up in the face of her frequently-not-so-brilliant leading male counterpart.

That is really annoying. Now moving on.The film is about the adventures of a gang of outlaws, and to a lesser degree a gang of mercenaries hired to bring them down. The new world is closing around the outlaws and the age is also starting to catch up with some of them. As far as Westerns go, this is the least original premise you could go with. However, that is just the skeleton. The film succeeds in strapping enough meat onto that skeleton to make the movie interesting and exciting. The storyline is loose, more of a set of adventures rather than a cohesive whole, but it is interesting nonetheless.A lot about Wild Bunch feels like a modern film. It is quite gritty; the music has modern rhythms; the characters are dark. In older westerns, whenever bandits are made to be the protagonists, they are also made to be misunderstood souls full of heart. In the Wild Bunch the outlaws, despite being the protagonists, do some pretty reprehensible things&#x85;well, at least sometimes.Perhaps the largest problem with the film is that it takes too much freedom with its characters (and by extension its story). The film starts showing the bandits as crazed violent people, but it appears that the makers could not resist adding more honor and humour to these gangsters, perhaps out of fear of making them too unlikable to the viewer. And so towards the end of the film they start acting more and more like heroes. Two of these guys in particular are portrayed as greedy criminal side-kicks in the beginning but in the end they get heroic for no particular reason other than Why not?, as one of them put it.In fact, the whole tone starts shifting together with the characters and becomes more and more light-hearted towards the middle of the film.Besides this strange character identity issue, the acting is actually quite good. Of particular note is the Mexican warlord played by a gentleman named Emilio Fernández. On paper that character is just a power-hungry warlord but the Mexican actor breathes life into the character with good facial expressions. He is perhaps the most memorable character in the film.There is unfortunately a good deal of overacting, like people laughing hysterically when there is nothing funny to laugh about. In fact, there is a lot of that in this movie.For the most part the film looks good. It has good atmosphere with its smoky Mexican villages and bath houses and mountains. There is however a problem in this film from which many of the modern action movies suffer the cuts during the main action scenes are too fast. You lose track of what is going on.The music does not have a memorable tune for you to whistle, but is nonetheless interesting because it has a lot of modern asymmetry, with many different instruments coming in to do the various tasks required each time and doing so using special rhythmic patterns.There is a recurrent little tune and when I heard it I immediately felt that these guys were ripping off The Magnificent Seven, until I found out that The Magnificent Seven came out 10 years after this movie. Food for thought&#x85; This film is not perfect. There are little things like a scene where you hear a man talk, but can see his mouth is not moving. There is an issue with the character development and an issue with the mood. There is just something off about its whole structure, including characters and story. Having said that, it still feels worth watching for its off-beat violent delivery and good atmosphere.

This movie connects well because of recent world news concerning the Ebola virus and in that regard, the film is downright scary. One thing the film did was make sure I develop some healthy habits. That being said, this a fast-paced movie that has an incredible cast and a story that is well-written. My only qualm about the movie is the helicopter chases near the end, as I don't believe they fit the overall story arch.Wolfgang Petersen's film is about how a fictional disease from Zaire called the Motaba runs rampant in a small California village. Now Colonel Sam Daniels and his CDC helpers must contain the virus before the virus spreads beyond the town's border.As mentioned before, the film has a very talented cast. It's surprising how many Oscar-winners are in the cast. Dustin Hoffman does very well as Sam Daniels and the man who wants to save the lives of the sick. Rene Russo likewise does a good job as Sam's estranged wife and co-worker. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Sam's boss, the man who is stuck in the middle. We also get great supporting turns from Kevin Spacey and the villainous Donald Sutherland.Overall, Outbreak is an excellent movie that raises the question what if? If any town gets an outbreak of a deadly virus, would the government and the military take the same course of action as they did in this film? No matter which way you look at it, it's a very scary thought. The film, along with 2011's Contagion, are two worthy films to watch if you want to be scared the unconventional way. Because trust me, this film is scary because it could very well happen in reality. As for filmmaking, this is a very intense, well-made film. I rate this film 9\/10.

No matter which way you look at it, it's a very scary thought. The film, along with 2011's Contagion, are two worthy films to watch if you want to be scared the unconventional way. Because trust me, this film is scary because it could very well happen in reality. As for filmmaking, this is a very intense, well-made film. I rate this film 9\/10.

This movie connects well because of recent world news concerning the Ebola virus and in that regard, the film is downright scary. One thing the film did was make sure I develop some healthy habits. That being said, this a fast-paced movie that has an incredible cast and a story that is well-written. My only qualm about the movie is the helicopter chases near the end, as I don't believe they fit the overall story arch.Wolfgang Petersen's film is about how a fictional disease from Zaire called the Motaba runs rampant in a small California village. Now Colonel Sam Daniels and his CDC helpers must contain the virus before the virus spreads beyond the town's border.As mentioned before, the film has a very talented cast. It's surprising how many Oscar-winners are in the cast. Dustin Hoffman does very well as Sam Daniels and the man who wants to save the lives of the sick. Rene Russo likewise does a good job as Sam's estranged wife and co-worker. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Sam's boss, the man who is stuck in the middle. We also get great supporting turns from Kevin Spacey and the villainous Donald Sutherland.Overall, Outbreak is an excellent movie that raises the question what if?

For all it violence and lack of verisimilitude, I get a kick out it ever time I see it. If one can't get past the fact that the Wile E. Coyote element is in here (where no one ever seems to get hurt, no matter what), you aren't going to have much fun. With that caveat, the movie is a bit of a hoot. McCauley Culkin came to stardom in this (it's too bad his life became unsettled after this). Watching Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, the ever optimistic though doomed villains, continue to fight a losing cause against an eight year old is the stuff cartoons are made of. Their mugging as they try one thing after another, only to be thwarted, is great fun. The subplot of the mother hooking up with a polka band, led by the inimitable John Candy, adds an element of joy. There is also the relationship that grows with a frightening man next door who has been tabbed a murderer by the insensitivity of the neighborhood kids. This man is estranged from his son and has lapsed into a sad existence. This raises this up from just a kid movie to one with a bit more substance. Anyway, don't take it to seriously and one may have a bit of fun at the holidays. ","genre":null},{"date":"2 January 2015","score":"","review":" My response to this movie is strictly prejudiced.

I'm not as squeamish as I used to be over the sight of physical damage to the human body, but Harry (Jared Leto) sticking that needle into his already severely abused arm caused me to turn my head more than once. I'm reading what an impact this film had on other reviewers here and I'm pretty convinced this is as powerful an anti-drug message as one could find anywhere. Trainspotting made it's point just as well on the other side of the pond some years earlier, but this one brings it closer to home. Aronofsky's style is manipulative in a way and tended to grate on me after a while, but when you think about it, that's the way it is with addiction. It requires users to use a split screen personality to hide their dependency while engaging in hyper-kinetic repetition to maintain a high. Ellen Burstyn's performance was magnificent and to my thinking, deserved the Oscar that went to Julia Roberts for Erin Brokovich. Leto and Connelly were convincing in their portrayals, though comparing their roles today to a decade ago shows how much they've grown as actors. I haven't seen Wayans as much so I don't want to short change him, but he did a fine job here as well. This isn't the kind of movie you simply watch and forget about, it's haunting message and grotesque visuals will stay with you long after the film is over.
