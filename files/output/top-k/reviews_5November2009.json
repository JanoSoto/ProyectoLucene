[{"date":"5 November 2009","score":"","review":" (Spoilers) When I first watched 'Go' many years ago, I thought it was just okay until one small scene set the intertwining story lines As there are three main Christmas Eve stories going on here, in story #2, a character in Las Vegas calls another one (Todd, aka the good drug dealer) in LA. We already saw Todd receive this call in #1. I was surprised for two reasons I knew nothing about this movie (including the 3 different chapters) prior to seeing and when that was easy to figure that out, I didn't know they would be so interwoven. I loved this movie. I loved the music (fast and slow), I loved the originality, the acting by all actors &#x96; especially and namely Polley (this is the movie that made me fall hard for her, as an actress that is), the sets, the pacing, comedy, dialogue and simple craziness of everything going on. It was like a young adult version of 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' or 'Seinfeld.' As mentioned, one Christmas Eve, grocery-store clerk Ronna inadvertently sets off a chain reaction between multiple lives while attempting to get enough money to avoid eviction the following day. That night is seen by various eyes and almost all intersects\/overlaps with pure escapism, comedy, fun and ends up as the less-dreary LA 'Crash' story. I could go on and on about all the actors, they were all pure fun to watch, but probably the top picks would be Polley, Olyphant, Askew and Diggs. Also, even after 10 years since its release, the dialogue and facial expressions (namely from the repeatedly stunned Todd) still had me rolling. It's not perfect, but for a far-above average rave movie with an actual plot, as well as far-above average killer soundtrack, it's worth a go.
