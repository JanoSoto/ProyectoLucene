But I hate to classify it as that, because if you do and someone reads that it's a war film, they're going to expect Saving Private Ryan.  The two were compared when first released because they were released the same year and were both up for Oscars.  However, the two are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FILMS WITH DIFFERENT INTENTIONS.  So, I won't waste time, energy or space comparing the two.There is a stellar, all-star cast, but there really is no star.  The film has a flexible narrative and the story adapted from James Jones' novel is told from different points of view.  This is a problem for today's audiences who are not open minded when watching a film that doesn't play like a standard popcorn flick or T.V. movie.  Like Mulholland Drive a viewer can come in the middle of it and not really miss anything as far as not understanding what's happening now.  It's like an or circular film that just keeps going - like the war for the soldiers that never seems to end.This film has been criticized so many times, for so many different reasons.  And those who criticize it, also criticize those who like it, saying that they (the people who like it) think that film is philosophical, when really it isn't.  Or theat the philosophy is only sophomoric.  But the film is about the soldiers and I would doubt that these soldiers were Philosophy majors, so if the philosophy is sophomoric (which I don't feel it is) it's because they are.  But I should point out and remind people that Terrence Malick taught Philosophy at MIT, and I would think he has a better comprehension of it that the people who are criticizing his use of it.I also think that the people who criticize this film are the same hypocrites who hated 2001 A Space Odyssey, until it became a classic, and then started to like it.  The Thin Red Line is a film that is ahead of an audience.  Like the work of Stanley Kubrick or David Lynch, the film takes more than one viewing to fully understand, which may be impossible.  But if you're open minded enough, it is such an enjoyable movie in its grandeur.  That is another thing people dislike, its pretensions.  But how do they expect Malick to deal with a subject as broad as WAR, and not just a group of soldiers, and avoid the possibility of pretension? Most war film deal with a select few that we as an audience get to know.  We don't here.  We only get to glance.  And we glance at so many people it's hard to KNOW any of them.

You'd get to know who you're close to, but the others, you would just see.I think that this film is more realistic about war than most.  We don't just see a constant attack.

Nick Notle, Elias Koteas, Woody Harrelson, Jim Caviezel are all fantastic.  The music is awe inspiring.  When the main theme hits a certain point, a few minutes in it's breathtaking.

Even I initially despised this film for reasons i now consider somewhat ignorant and close-minded. For starters, Many viewed this film coming down from the non-stop adrenaline rush that was Jim Cameron's Aliens, a film very far removed from the original '79 classic. The biggest problem i had with Aliens was Cameron all but threw out the original ideas Ridley Scott and his crew had concieved, even turning H.R Gieger's elegant and terrifying creature into an armored war - machine, good only for quick scares and cannon fodder. On the other hand Cameron introduced some great supporting characters in the form of Hicks and Newt. Before Alien 3 was announced, an independant Comic Book publisher named Dark Horse Comics published a sequel to Cameron's Aliens in comic book form. In this story Hicks and Newt become the central characters, and the tone becomes much closer to that of the original film. Ripley's presence is felt in the form of a metaphorical ghost, while not directly appearing, the mystery of her whereabouts and circumstances of her dissapearence following the events of the film Aliens lend purpose to the characters of the book, which brings us at last to Alien 3. Fincher took the road least expected, bringing the series back to its roots following the success of the second film, this move alone damned the film as far as i'm concerned. The explosion and saturation of the second film into popular culture ensured that it would go down as a classic, while the first film remained a cult-status masterpiece, and thus the vast majority of film-goers were watching the third outing from the James Cameron perspective rather than the Ridley Scott one.Where Fincher succeeds is in the bleak, desolate imagining of Fury 151, a male penal colony located on a planet about as pleasant as hell on earth. The pacing, mood, atmosphere and even simple things like Fincher's use of sound in the film add to the frightening nature, the opening alone, with it's dead quiet-sudden rush of flame-dead quiet-sudden alarm etc. sets a frightening note to start on, leaving us in bewilderment as to what's actually going on, quick little glimpses and the voice of a computer are used so effectively in evoking panic. This tactic works well throughout the film, even in it's slow moments, oftentimes tricking or manipulating the viewer, sometimes with false alarms, sometimes not. Fincher also digs a little deeper than even Ridley Scott did into the drama inherent in the Ripley character, the tradgedy surrounding her, and how she and the alien share a bond in a sense, much to her dismay. The tension and drama all add up to an incredible sequence near the end when the inmates struggle to lure the Alien into a lead press. The frenetic pacing, after such a slow build up, works very effectively.Where Fincher et al go wrong, is in their use of characters, for reasons i figure had more to do with executive politics and the availability of certain actors than with plot or storyline, Hicks and Newt are mercilessly killed off during the opening sequence. This reeks to me of Michael Bihen is unavailable. or  'fill in the blank' doesnt want Michael or Carrie back again... lets off 'em rather than Lets make it even more tragic, lets have Ripley lose those she cares most for. To be fair, Lance Henrikson does make an appearance as the ruined android Bishop, as well as a poorly concieved and poorly handled appearance as the company scientist on whom Bishop was based. If George Lucas ever went ahead and did Star Wars 7, and un-ceremoniuosly killed off Han and Leia in the opening sequence, you get the equivalent of Alien 3. I think it's this 'detachment' from the second film which really ruins it for many and not so much the return to a darker, moodier setting. This series was not about Ripley at one point, sure she was a survivor and all, but she was a piece of the whole, and this film strips away some of her charm by elevating her to 'sole character' status, which also kills a lot of her likeability as far as i'm concerned. Alien Ressurection proved this even further in my opinion, completely destroying the character created by Scott, and expanded upon by Cameron and even Fincher. The other inmates of the prison should have been given a tighter focus, and the most interesting of the lot (the doctor) should not have been one of the first to be killed off.In all Fincher assembles a noble film every bit as good as its predecessors, however it is a film which must be viewed on it's own merits, one must put Cameron's Aliens as far back into his mind as possible.

Besides, I like Mariah Carey--as a singer--and felt, Hey, at least there might be some good music.There are a few good songs and Mariah is beautiful, but this film is utter crap!!!  Why this was even released in theaters beats me!  It should've been just shown on VH1.The plot couldn't be more predictable and the premise couldn't be more cliched.  Mariah Carey plays a normal, everyday girl who dreams of becoming a superstar and ends up rising to the top, having to cope with the price of fame.  How original!  There's an allegedly depressing moment towards the end of the film, but I wasn't shedding a single tear because I didn't care for any of the characters.  The dialogue is horrible.  The acting is way under par.Carey is cute and charming, with a smile to die for, but that can't overshadow her lack of acting skills.  And why in the hell did Vondie Curtis-Hall cast Max Beesley in the co-starring role?  I've never seen him in any other movies, but in this one he's terrible.  Not to mention that his attempt at a New York accent is the worst!  When I saw Erin Brockovich I wasn't aware that Albert Finney was English, before I saw him in an interview.  I was aware that Beesley was English, because during half the film he seems to forget that he's playing a New Yorker and starts talking in his normal accent!  Pitiful, pitiful, pitiful!  The only actors that added a hint of professionalism to the cast were Terence Howard (from The Best Man and Angel Eyes) and Dorian Harewood (from Full Metal Jacket and Sudden Death).  Howard doesn't have too many successful films under his belt, but he is an underrated talent and being one of the two good actors in this disaster makes him look like Brando.  And the same goes for Harewood, who actually does have a series of successful films under his belt.  Oh, yes, and I forgot to mention Tia Texada, who some may remember from Nurse Betty.  She is a talented actress who has real potential, and she's very beautiful.  She is also too good for this cast.  And what is Vondie Curtis-Hall doing, directing crap like this?  He happens to be a very talented actor, with great roles in films like Eve's Bayou, but he obviously needs pointers behind the camera.  With the exception of a few aerial shots, this could easily be mistaken for a TV movie.The movie is set in 1983, and I'm fascinated by the whole culture of the eighties, but even that eighties vibe couldn't spice things up.  There are some extremely heavy-handed, cheesy moments.  The way the plot is set up is Mariah is a backup singer for the wife of a big-time music producer--who also produces her music.  She is a terrible singer, whereas Mariah has the voice of a goddess, so he turns off his wife's microphone and basically just records Mariah's voice.  And in another scene, they're performing live and the same thing is done--her mike is turned off and just Mariah's voice is heard.  So nobody notices--including her--that everyone's hearing Mariah's voice, instead of the lead singer.  Take the corniest soap opera and add music--you have Glitter.Trust all the negative reviews!

It is worth seeing more than once. All the reviews I have read have been positive but I really don't listen to critics too much because it's just their opinion. Sometimes when they say a movie is great, I see it and it stinks or they say it stinks and I love it. So I suggest everyone should make their own decision and opinion of the movie. I personally loved the movie. My older brother and everyone in the theater loved it too.The book is incredible. It's alittle different than the movie but both are excellent.

Although still disconcerting, the subject of pedophilia is far less shocking today than when the book was published almost 50 years ago.  Yet, despite the subject matter, the book was wildly popular because it was a literary work of art, beautifully written with some of the most splendid metaphors and descriptive narrative in American literature.  This was all the more amazing when one considers that English was Nabokov's second language.Director Adrian Lynn (Fatal Attraction, 9 ½ weeks, Indecent Proposal) is no stranger to stories with perverse sexual content.  His presentation of the story does the book justice although certain interpretations may not have been what Nabokov had in mind.  Lynn gives us a presentation that is very sympathetic to Humbert.  Nabokov's Humbert was very complex, partly a victim of his fixation on young girls, partly a sexual predator and partly a hopeless romantic.  Nabokov's Lolita was extremely innocent, just approaching the threshold of sexual curiosity and urges, more playful than consciously provocative.  While Nabokov hints at a mutual seduction, he leans far more heavily towards Humbert as the cause of the events even though Humbert is clearly helpless in the face of his obsession.  Lolita entered into the sexual relationship more as a result of longings burgeoning from her blossoming sexuality than a desire to seduce Humbert in particular, who was not even her first lover. Lynn's presentation transforms Humbert from the seducer into the seduced, whose weakness for young girls is manipulated by a sexually precocious siren tempting him to dash himself on the shoals of pedophilia.  Lynn portrays Lolita as the aggressor, an adolescent temptress who knows she is desired and simultaneously teases and entices him to do her lustful bidding, knowing he is powerless to resist.  Lynn's Humbert is more of a hapless romantic than a fiend, ennobling him as a victim of love rather than the confounded sociopath he really is.  In Lynn's version, Humbert becomes the fly to Lolita's spider.However, after the initial seduction when they take to the road, the film is very true to the book in chronicling the decay of the relationship, Humbert's further plunge into feelings of romantic desperation and Lolita's shrewish exploitation of him as she increasingly uses sex as a weapon.  The book was very effective at portraying the relationship as a symbiosis of two deficient beings, each selfishly taking from the other what was needed.  Lynn does an excellent job of portraying that here.  As the relationship degenerates, Lynn is effectual at portraying the ugly side of both characters.  The bitterness and rancor that results is compelling.  To his credit, he understands that Nabokov's story was more of a character study than a sex story and Lynn avoids the temptation of becoming too lurid, focusing instead on solid character development of two very flawed beings.I must take a moment to give Lynn the highest praise for his period renderings.  This is one of the finest portrayals of 1940's Americana I can remember.  The costumes, hairstyles, cars, furniture, locations and sets create a 40's reality that is like being hurtled back in a time machine.  The music is not just precise for the period, but it is perfectly integrated with the story.  As the two travel, the music changes to reflect the region.  Having Lolita dance and sing to period music on the radio is a nice touch because that is exactly what teenage girls of any era are apt to do.The acting is first rate all around.  When the film was made, Dominique Swain was 17, and although she looked young for her age, she could never pass for 12.  So for the first part of the film before Charlotte's demise, she is simply too mature.  However, for the road trip she is ideal.  Though I don't agree with Lynn's early interpretation of Lolita as the teenage temptress, I can't imagine it being done any better than the performance Swain delivers.  She is playful and provocative in a childlike manner, part pixie and part vamp.  Once they get on the road, Swain hits stride with a performance that is almost a force of nature.  She is powerful and intense, effortlessly moving back and forth between sweet innocence and the emotional torrent typified by the `murder me' scene.  It is an outstanding performance with depth and breadth that is very unusual for an actor so young.Jeremy Irons is wonderful as Humbert, giving him as amiable a personality as one could possibly imagine for a character with such vile intentions.  Irons injects a good deal of wry humor into the part in addition to giving Humbert an almost quixotic romantic quality.  Melanie Griffith is just the wrong actress to play Charlotte.  She looks nothing like the portly and plain character described in Nabokov's book.  Though her acting is fine and she is appropriately obsequious, she is far too attractive to be the repulsive troll Humbert despised.  It takes away from Humbert's desperation because it hardly seems like a great sacrifice to have married Charlotte to be near Lolita.Frank Langella (Dracula) is more obnoxious than mysterious as Quilty, making the audience want to exhort Humbert to pull the trigger as he confronts Quilty with the revolver.  Again, I think this is probably Lynn's doing since his vision is clearly that of a Humbert sympathizer.This is a fine film with great production values, terrific performances and a classic story.  I feel that it surpasses Kubrik's adaptation in its ability to capture many of the finer points of Nabokov's book, even though Nabokov collaborated on the Kubrik film.  I rated it an 8\/10.  It is definitely worth digging out of the rental stacks.

The opening scenes, Tom Cruise's dream of being alone in New York, was extremely effective.  Being alone when you don't want to be is everyone's nightmare, so finding yourself alone in a deserted city, and a futuristic version of your hometown at that, would be twice as scary.  That out of the way, we were introduced to character A (Cruise), the pleasure seeking, rich, handsome publishing executive who runs a multi-million dollar company while getting as much enjoyment out of life as he can.  Are we supposed to like him less because he inherited the company, rather than having to work for it?  Is there any nobility in being handed riches on a plate?  We also meet character B, hero's best friend, and character C, hero's girlfriend.  Or rather, she thinks she is his girlfriend but he thinks she is just his friend with whom he can sleep from time to time.   At Cruise's birthday party (was that Stephen Spielberg as himself giving Cruise a hug and wishing him happy birthday?) we meet character D, a female friend of character B.  A decides he wants D, takes it slowly for the sake of enjoying the chase but as we all know he will, he gets her in the end.    This is not to character C's liking, so she deliberately crashed her car off a bridge while character A is in the passenger seat, killing herself and injuring A so that he survives with disfiguring injuries and has to wear a mask.All very straightforward.  The twists come as a series of incidents unfold during which we wonder about Cruise's grip on reality.  Yes, we see into his dreams sometimes, but then we are left wondering when the dreams stop and reality begins.  And all is eventually revealed.  But by that time I was impatient with the movie and getting to the stage of wanting it to end and not caring as much as I did half an hour earlier what happened to the characters.

It keeps its art with its opening and ending, its dazzle with the dance and the music, and our attention with the story. Its funny, sad, and overall, a great show. Surely all the other summaries have told you what its about (but frankly, who cares? This is one of the few movies you can watch for the whole purpose of a movie, or simply because ITS JUST SO FUN!)As said, this is almost perfect! So what kept me from giving it a ten? Two things, really.1) EDITING - I know editors are professionals. They get paid six digits for their work. I know you have to keep the story going. Otherwise, it's just a drown of music. But really, could it have hurt to have an extra second on each take? For me, it was just annoying to CONSTANTLY cut from place to place. Rarely did it slow. For 1\/3 a second, you see a dress, but then it's a person, no wait, that was a - was that a dancing midget? No, it was the main character doing a quick solo - or was it something I was suppose to know for the story? Wait, what'd I miss when I thought that? Its just too overwhelming. I guess it was the point, but some people LIKE to actually see the characters DANCE, as opposed to quick shots of them jumping (honestly, that's how quick it was, I could only tell they were jumping at certain points.)2) SOUND - Sadly, I saw the movie on DVD, which was programmed for surround sound, which I don't have.

There's no doubt about Luhrmann's directorial prowess.Where this movie ultimately fails is in the casting.  There are some really miserable performances here.

Claire Danes gives a horridly flat performance and she appears not to know what the words mean. Both of them suffer from a continual bad hair day which ultimately distracts from the romance and fantasy. The final scene is the best that either of them achieve, but that's due to Luhrmann's brilliant stage timing.Paul Sorvino is so ridiculously over the top as a mafioso Capulet that it is almost laughable.  And why does Mrs. Capulet have a southern accent??? John Leguziamo as Tybalt is also hard to understand and too one dimensional in his villainy.  Brian Denehey looks bored with the whole project.

It's just too bad that it ruined his movie.Could he have done better?  Certainly! Robert Sean Leonard looks as good as DiCaprio and would have made the words meaningful.

The book is VERY well written and is one of the better documented and researched books on modern warfare. Rather than just a historical summary, Mark Bowden went out and talked to many of the soldiers who took part in these raids in Mogadishu in '93.I had some fears because this was a Jerry Bruckheimer production, and with films like Con Air and the remake of Gone in 60 seconds to his credit, he is a bit spotty at best.The movie was directed by Ridley Scott, who occasionally misses (1492) he mostly hits with his many gritty portrayals of people in tough places.  He shot the film in Morocco, but one could easily believe that you were in The Mog.  The utter depravity and destruction of years of civil war were shown out in the rusted hulks of cars and the debris from destroyed buildings throughout the streets.Some fast facts  Somalia had no government any longer, and 300,000 people died of hunger while rival warlords fought over the port of Mogadishu.  One leader, Mohammed Farrah Aidid took control of the port area and stole all of the UN food shipments.  In a starving nation, food is power and hunger is a weapon.  The US and the UN sent in forces in late 92 to try and restore order and the flow of food.  When the Marines drove onto the beach in their amphibious assault vehicles, CNN was there with bright floodlights to capture the action.  The Marines eventually left, and the gangs started preying on the UN troops, with the slaughter of 24 Pakistani peacekeepers being the final straw.  The US sent back in Delta Force and Ranger units, with the aim to capture as many Somali warlords and their lieutenants as they could.The film opens up with scenes of the horror of the place, and how the deprivations of the people by the warlords gangs were being delegated to the UN to solve.  Our Rangers were ordered to stand by and watch as civilians are slaughtered by Aidid's henchmen.  The Rangers were only allowed to perform their operations.  Meanwhile our leadership there was planning a raid to capture many of Aidid's top men.The raid begins, and things quickly go to hell.  It was believed that the helicopters were relatively safe because any weapon large enough to bring one down would be spotted, and the most common large weapon, the Soviet Rocket Propelled Grenade, or RPG, couldn't be fired up at the choppers, because the rocket blast from firing would severly burn the firer. The Somalis were able to adapt a sheet of tin to re-aim the back blast so that the firer would not immolate himself in his attempt to shoot the chopper, and the Somalis RPG teams hid the weapon, rockets, and blast chute under their clothes until ready to fire.  The result is choppers down, and a thirty minute raid becomes a very long affair.The film is a very good adaptation of what that kind of combat was like, as seen through the interviews of Mark Bowden.  You see the confusion of the men trying to navigate through the narrow and confusing streets of Mogadishu.  You see the horror of close urban fighting (the very fighting we avoided by stopping when we did in Iraq).  There is heroism and loss.  Somehow, this film brings off the big budget stars and high value explosions without succumbing the the typical Hollywood tearjerking emotionalism.  There are a couple monologues, but they are expressed from both sides, Somali and American on why they were there and what they hoped to achieve.Its my opinion, shared by many, that the US went too far in trying to be kinder and gentler in this affair.  President Clinton would not allow us to send any armor or heavy equipment over there, so the most we had to use against the Somalis were Kevlar reinforced hard top HMMWVs (Hum-vees) and 2 1\/2 ton trucks, which were unarmored.  The consequences of those thin skinned vehicles going up against trucks equipped with heavy machine-guns and small cannon were disastrous.  Clinton also vetoed the use of powerful suppressive fire weapons such as the AC-130 Spectre gunship.  We had to rely on the UN for supporting armor or heavy vehicles, and with that came politicking and endless delays, which were only solved when we threatened to take the vehicles and put American crews in them.  The fact that the Italian peacekeeping soldiers were openly passing information to the Somalis before each American raid didn't help their success.It is no small irony that the very president who fled our country rather than serve it in Vietnam repeated the very same mistakes by trying to win the hearts and minds of the Somali while hamstringing the military who's job it was to make this happen.This was a brutal, awful place that the UN tried to restore a bit of order to so they could try and keep millions of people from starving.  I don't know what kind of real solution you can achieve when life is cheap, power comes from the barrel of a gun, and the leaders could care less how many of their own people starve.  In the end, those with the guns and food are still the ones running the country.
