OK, she is beautiful in this film, she isn't as good actress as pretty she is, but unless she made an effort to make a nice performance, not the best you can find in Bond movies, but no the worse either.The relationship between James and Major Anya Amasova (Barbara Bach) is always fun to watch since they are the best British spy and the best Russian counterpart so, they are always competing to prove who is the best. And it is amazing to think that in the 70's a woman could be competing to a man in first place, because that's a 90's woman feature, so her part can be considered revolutionary.Now, let's leave the actors aside and let's focus in the music, in what respects to me, the best Bond song so far, high 5 for Carly Simon for giving us this perfect song.The locations are great as in all Bond movies of course, and one of the best scenes ever are in this movies. We have, for instance that scene of Bond skiing dressed of yellow, one of the best ever, and was made by stunts in only one shot! It is unbelievable. that was great. And then the movie takes us to Egypt, Italy, and to the Sea Base of Karl Stromberg (the villain).....There is something that could have been better, but it is something usual in Bond movies, the main assistant of the villain ( in this case, Jaws) is almost invincible, so that's maybe the only flaw in Bond franchise. Many people say this villain is great, and others say it is a horrible character for that same reason, but those who say this, also say that their favourite Bond Villain is Oddjob!!!C'mon, that's the most stupid character in all the movies, he didn't even speak, c'mon!But i leave it up to you to decide, whether this is or not the best Bond movie ever, it is for me, since it is a perfect mix of everything the bond franchise is about.....so i give The spy who loved me ***** out of 5 stars.

Out & about, Chucky tracks down ANDY BARCLAY (The returning ALEX VINCENT) now living with a foster family. Chucky attempts to accomplish a mission he failed to do the last time Trade souls with the first person he revealed his secret to - young Andy, since the voodoo spell he uses to switch bodies will not work on other humans. Like the last time, Chucky only has so long to accomplish his mission, because he is slowly turning human & if he becomes fully human within the frame of the doll, he'll be trapped as a doll forever. Along the way, he picks up where he last left off, cutting a swath of blood through a series of victims.CHILD'S PLAY 2 is a really fun sequel, to a really fun, scary horror film! It has many moments to rival the original films many suspenseful sequences, such as Andy looking for Chucky, while roaming about the basement in the middle of the night, where he knows Chucky is hiding out. Teen bad girl Kyle, discovering the corpse of her foster mother & being attacked by Chucky in the bedroom only for him to disappear & her looking around wondering where he will strike. A huge stalk & chase in a doll factory etc. KEVIN YAGHER'S new Chucky puppet is much better looking than his old one. It's clear the film-makers had more money to play with, since they are able to do more things with the puppet than what they were last time. The co-screenwriter of the first, JOHN LAFIA (DON MANCINI also returns to pen the script) slips into the directors chair for this one, taking the reigns from original director Tom Holland & does a fabulous job, milking many scenes in the film, for more maximum tension suspense & impact. BRAD DOURIF reprises his role as Chucky (He provides the voice) & further goes to show that in another actors hands, Chucky just wouldn't be anywhere near as fun. The acting works for the most part, Christina Elise is really good as the teenage heroine of the show, while An American Werewolf In London's own JENNY AUGUTTER & C.H.U.D. II's GERRIT GRAHAM, both put in good performances as the foster family. Alex Vincent continues to be a real find in his role as the sympathetic Andy. What should be noted about CHILD'S PLAY 2 is despite it's serious storyline, the film-makers have turned him into an almost Freddy Kruger like character, since he spews a series of bad puns before, during & after he dismantles his victims, something he didn't do in the first. Weather taking the franchise into the realm that the later A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET entries went with Freddy, was a choice on the film-makers part, or a result of the studio heads is not known. The film has a light sprinkling of comedy, as one can't help but chuckle at Chucky's bad puns. What also should be noted is how several concepts in the film are taken from the original film's psychological horror driven script (Then titled BLOOD BUDDY) a bully who troubles Andy (Though this adds nothing to the film & could so easily have been written around) & a teacher who keeps Andy after school winds up being killed by Chucky, when he batters her repeatedly with a ruler (Ironically enough the original CHILD'S PLAY script was later adopted & re-written in areas & filmed as Pinocchio's Revenge\/Pinocchio Syndrome, a direct to video horror film released in 1996)That said I did have a problem with the films concept early on. We are informed from the outset, that Andy's mother has been put in a psychiatric hospital over her claims that Chucky was alive & was doing all the murders, yet whatever became of Mike Norris & his partner? surely they could have backed her story, since they both seen Chucky alive themselves? Since Chucky was becoming human at the end, wouldn't the police & Play Pal Toy executives find it a little odd that Chucky had a human tongue, blood in him, & human teeth? what about his body? would it not contain some human organs including remnants of his shot to pieces heart? wouldn't this give them cause to pause & wonder why a plastic doll, had these odd features? speaking of the body, why is it that his head is used by the executives to see what malfunctioned & not the rest of the body? what made them think that the head had something to do with a malfunction & not some other part of the doll? None of this is really answered. GRAEME REVELL does the score here & it's terrific throughout. Look for MATT ROE as a cop, he played a psychic in PUPPET MASTER, another killer doll movie to emerge on video shelves after the original CHILD'S PLAY.All in all, while is is nowhere near as scary as the first, CHILD'S PLAY 2 has it's own wicked sense of style & fun. It's not very gory, but it's death scenes are pretty neat & the whole plot is pretty fun. Highly entertaining & fun & definitely recommended to fans of the first.

Look for MATT ROE as a cop, he played a psychic in PUPPET MASTER, another killer doll movie to emerge on video shelves after the original CHILD'S PLAY.All in all, while is is nowhere near as scary as the first, CHILD'S PLAY 2 has it's own wicked sense of style & fun. It's not very gory, but it's death scenes are pretty neat & the whole plot is pretty fun. Highly entertaining & fun & definitely recommended to fans of the first.

Keanu Reeves?! At first glance it seems to be a joke. River Phoenix in the lead role? A film using classical dialogue set in modern day dealing with prostitution, bisexuality, homosexuality, heterosexuality, drugs, violence, and sex? But it's more than just that. At its core My Own Private Idaho is a soft and delicate examination of a young man who doesn't have a place in life and is trying to find his way along the beaten path; the road that stretches continually onwards, never ending. I've been here before, Mike (Phoenix) says to Scott Favor (Reeves). He's speaking of the road before them. He isn't speaking literally, of course. But he's been there spiritually and mentally before. He knows he'll see it again, too.Gus Vant Sant was close to the material and based the characters on real men he knew in Portland, Oregon. Van Sant is a homosexual and perhaps that is why the subject matter -- fairly risqué and controversial even by today's standards -- was handled with such care, never seeming exploitative, but rather crucial and caring. It's a testament to the film's universal appeal that it was critically _and_ publicly praised on release and, at least to my knowledge, did not create the wave of controversy that it easily could have. (After all, it's a mainstream production centered around bisexual and homosexual street hustlers, and features on-screen orgasms and explicit -- or at least seemingly explicit -- freeze-frame sex scenes. After all, just remember the uproar Midnight Cowboy caused when it came out.) What I remember most fondly about My Own Private Idaho is its truly beautiful photography and direction. The cinematography is one of the best examples of truly stunning visuals I've ever seen. The touching musical score only complements the outer layer.I won't lie This film will not appeal to everyone. It is quite experimental and could understandably be criticized for its lengthy middle, which awkwardly transforms into a Shakespeare spin-off, and then -- in its last act -- returns to reality and abandons the stiff dialogue.Still, in my opinion, the Shakespeare elements are fairly important to the story and don't really harm it at all. The story, when stripped of its outer layers, is really just a tender story about the rites of passage of a young man. And love. Something we can all relate to, if we take away the specifics of the situation.River Phoenix is extraordinary in the lead role and in my opinion, My Own Private Idaho solidified his impressive talents as one of the generation's best young actors.

Harry Angel (A cocky Mickey Rourke)is hired by a mysterious client named Louis Cyphre (A dark Robert DeNiro) to find a musician named Johnny Favourite. Angel is a crude, rather uncouth individual who, at first doesn't want the case, but the chance at earning a nice sum of money, jumps at the chance. Pretty soon, he wishes he hasn't as he is drawn into a very dark landscape involving voodoo,weird visions (Blood everywhere, a person in black sitting in front of an electric chair, and an elevator), and murder in Louisianna. Whenever Angel talks to his acquaintances, they end up dead in gruesome ways (One poor soul ends up in gumbo!).O.K. Kids, this is where the spoilers come into play, so if you haven't seen this film WALK AWAY NOW!!! There are 3 reasons why this film is incredibly creepy 1) The ending When Harry Angel finds out the disturbing truth that HE is Favourite and that Cyphre is Lucifer (Which people should have figured out in the beginning), you are in just as much disbelief as he is! How on earth did this happen? When Cyphre breaks it down, and the viewer can see the evidence, then it makes sense. Angel screams in denial, saying that he knows who he is, but then he (And us)starts to realize that he's wrong. He admits to himself (And to the viewers)that HE had committed the horrible murders in the film.2)Lisa Bonnet I was (and still am) a die-hard fan of The Cosby Show, and will always see her as Denise Huxtable. Her role as Epiphany was a total change, and to see her in an INCREDIBLY STEAMY love scene with Rourke totally shattered that image. Then for us to find out that she was Rourke's daughter? Another sin that will surely send him to hell (Incest, as well as murder).3)The images and soundsThe constant use of blood,spiral staircases,and elevators are used in a nightmarish way. The viewer gets caught up in the nightmare, swirling out of control like Harry. The final image, of Harry in an elevator, going down, is the scariest of all. You KNOW who he is and what he's done, and he is going to burn. Simply put, he's on an express elevator to hell.One of Alan Parker's best, and he gets great performances from everyone, especially Rourke. And a guarantee good film to give you the shivers!

I couldn't believe what I was reading, and thought to myself, Maybe I should see it again. I vaguely recalled being disappointed in the film on first viewing years and years ago but nonetheless I decided to give it a second chance, taking into account the fact that it was a supposed tongue-in-cheek satire of male action flicks.Sadly, I only hated it even more.

It would be fairly enjoyable as a no-brainer if not for the fact that it has gained some sort of reputation for being a classic. In my opinion, it is not a classic by any means. First of all, Kathryn Bigelow (James Cameron's ex-wife) falls victim to her excessive styling again (later to be seen to an even greater extent in the bloated Strange Days in 1995).

Yeah, I know it sounds kind of cheesy and it is but this was 1944, an entire different world back then and moviegoers ate that stuff up. However it is these elements that make movies from Hollywood's golden era so wonderful. There were no special effects to dazzle the audience with in those days they had to rely on good writing, acting and directing all three of those elements were well done here. The sex and violence were implied instead of being displayed on the screen in living color leaving nothing to the imagination like movies of today.I myself have to confess in this world of CSI Crime Scene Investigation where there is plenty of blood and guts displayed on the TV screen each week to give the audience as much realism as possible I found myself critiquing this movie for their lack of it. The woman that was murdered had her head blown off with a shotgun right in her apartment and there as no mess! The next day the police and some of the other characters were tramping around in that apartment and there as no blood splatter, not even a bloody napkin. All of that was left to our imagination but we have become so desensitized by today's realism that it is hard to not look for the blood and guts. Laura is a good movie even sixty years later and for someone like me loves classic Hollywood I was surprised I had not seen it before. If you like classic film noir Laura is for you.

Gene Tierney was a goddess DiNozzo went on to say.Laura was classic film noir with all of its elements, the hard-boiled detective, the beautiful dame the shady suspects all of who had motive. It had all of the plot twists implicating all of suspects at one point or another only until in the last ten minutes of film was real killer reveled.Laura (Gene Tierney) was a remarkably beautiful woman on the inside as well as on the outside and every man that came in contact with her fell in love with her even the detective (Dana Andrews) investigating her murder. He was mesmerized by her portrait that hung in her apartment, he could not get over her stunning beauty. As the investigation progressed he learned more about his victim and could not seem to get her off his mind. He was falling in love with her image and as silly as it was he could not help it. There something about this woman that captivated him. He spent one night in her apartment drinking and staring at her portrait.

Saw this one on TV after 15 years or so and I must admit it's one helluva piece of entertainment. Yeah, it has older-than-a-Bible James Brown,virtually no plot and non-moving actors like Lundgren and Nielsen....but,the last 20 minutes are hilarious to say the least. Drago(Lundgren)has a punch strength of about 2000 PSI,meaning his blows are twice harder than Tyson's, for example. He manages to hit Rocky in the head about 50 times and Rocky still survives 15 rounds. Not only survives, he wins and he even has enough juice to make a poignant speech. What surprises me is the amount of IMDb comments stating well, it's not that impossible, when you're focused on something you can endure pretty much etc. First three movies in Rocky installment had somewhat credible storyline, although final fight with Clubber was fairly exaggerated. Here we have exaggeration multiplied by 50  Drago kills Creed in round 2 and he uses same kind of attack on Rocky, he sends him 8 or 9 times on the floor and Rocky fights back for the first time in round 5.Come on, by that time he would have been already declared dead and received a Viking funeral.This movie is not all that bad, it has an excellent soundtrack and scene in which Rocky drives around reminiscing of his previous fights with No easy way out going in the back is touching, but fails miserably in department of plot development and credibility.Creed and Clubber were strong fighters but Rocky still had a decent chance against them, that made first three movies so believable. There's no way middle-aged midget like Balboa could have defeated someone with superhuman abilities like Drago...But I assume USA needed a patriotic boost in a midst of Cold War and Stallone certainly provided it with Rambo 3 and Rocky 4.

She comes across as dull, even wooden, and lacking in warmth. Minnelli extracts a sort of performance from her, but none of her emotions ring true.

Charisse, like so many sub-par leading ladies, just makes faces. But, boy, does she look good in those costumes!Charisse's limitations hurt the central romance with Astaire, which already has the handicap of the difference in their ages. The whole romance plot falls flat. You don't believe they're in love or care who that cold fish Charisse ends up with, so there's never any suspense.Then there's the almost complete disconnection between the production numbers and the plot. THE BAND WAGON is the opposite of an integrated musical songs pop up as complete non sequiturs, like the Louisa\/Have more Beer song at the cast party (what is that tiresome number doing in the film????) and the stunningly out-of-place Louisiana Hayride, which seems clipped from entirely different movie.I know Minnelli and Co. wanted a wide variety of numbers, but here they seem random. The whole film would be stronger if more of the songs had some relation to the story, or at least to its moods.There is also a hard-sell quality, a forced gaiety to this film -- and also to SINGIN' IN THE RAIN -- that turns me off.

Every element is designed, color-coordinated, and choreographed to death, leaving no room for any kind of spontaneity, and giving parts of the film an almost inhuman quality. You see this in the frantic Shine On Your Shoes number, which seems both unimaginative in its use of the arcade location, and so over-hyped, you think the cast and crew had overdosed on benzedrine. The result is off-putting -- everybody seems to be trying way too hard. In the 30s, Astaire made everything look easy.

The scenes in the B-52, and the scenes involving the army trying to take control back of a base-gone-loco have an almost newsreel documentary feel to them The contrast between the serious, reportage-style direction and the at times over-the-top characters and dialogue works brilliantly to keep the movie focused and the sense of impending disaster palpable, whilst still allowing the mostly subtle humour to play out. Fairly early in the film, we're given a close up shot of General Ripper's brooding face from an unusual angle, the camera looking up at his visage as if his face were a huge, insurmountable rock - as soon as this superb shot revealed itself I had the uneasy feeling that Ripper might be a bit 'funny' as President Muffley later explains.The only person in a position to get through to Ripper through his apparent madness is Captain Mandrake, one of the three characters to appear in the film to be portrayed by Peter Sellers. Later on Ripper confides in Mandrake as to the extent of the conspiracy theory that led him to his drastic course of action  the Commies are contaminating our 'precious body fluids', most likely through fluoridation of the water supply. How had he come by this umm, interesting theory, Mandrake quite reasonably asks at one point ? Here, I believe, one of the films key themes and elements are revealed - Ripper tells Mandrake that he first became aware of the Communist 'conspiricy' during the physical act of love - Ripper goes on to explain (in rather cryptic terms) that after failing to become aroused, or perhaps losing his erection, he came to realise that his bodily fluids were being taken or contaminated. He then goes to some pains to make it clear that the problem had *not* happened again, and that women still found him 'powerful'.So in essence, Ripper's failure to cope with his own compromised masculinity led to his insanity and subsequent order to attack the 'Russkies' !! So a madman has potentially started world war 3. No real surprise there, as the focus turns to the initially unseen General Buck Turgidson - the General is at first unconcerned over a phone call from a base commander, accepted by his bathing-beauty 'secretary', and continues his business in the 'powder room' for a painfully long time before finally deigning to speak to the worried base commander himself.Turgidson decides the situation is serious enough to warrant leaving his young, barely-clad lady friend in their hotel room whilst he puts in a little overtime in the War Room. In a later scene, Ms. Scott, his secretary, thoughtlessly rings Turgidson in the War Room - before hanging-up, Turgidson ever-so-briefly reflects upon the precarious situation at hand and thoughtfully advises Ms. Scott not to forget to say her prayers ...Hilarity and double-speak ensues throughout the entire first War Room scene, Turgidson's zealousness to turn the accidental encroachment on soviet airspace into a full scale strike is demented logic at its finest. Somewhat fortunately, the President, once again played by Peter Sellers, is less of a war-monger than the General, and he enlists the aid of the somewhat reluctant Russian ambassador to contact the Russian Premier, the apparently drunk Dimitri Kissoff. Sellers one-sided conversation with Kissoff is a side-splitter, desperate not to offend the Premier whilst still trying to gently break the news of impending air strikes. The Russians go one-up on the Yanks though, when it comes to light that they have constructed a 'Doomsday device', which is deadly enough to pretty much f*ck up the world - if the rogue B-52's commissioned by Ripper accomplish their mission, they will unwittingly be activating the Doomsday device ! This is when Sellers' third, and most bizarre, character is introduced, the titular Dr. Strangelove. As he 'helpfully' points out, a Doomsday device is a great deterrent for Nuclear War - er, provided the rest of the World is aware of the *threat* first ! However, as the Russian Ambassador points out, the existence of the Doomsday device hadn't been announced to that stage as the Premier was due to announce it at an upcoming conference, due to his love of 'suprises' hehehe. And so it's all set-up for a tense finale, as Mandrake tries to obtain vital codes from General Ripper to recall the B-52's, President Muffley and his cohorts try to work with the Russian government to blow their own men out of the sky to avoid mass destruction, and a B-52 flown by Major 'King' Kong attempts to deliver it's mother lode upon it's intended target before they're shot out of the sky.I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed this film, it's sharp humour, it's psychological profiles of the egomaniacs that would end the world, their sexual insecurity, the petty bickering over relatively insignificant matters while the fate of the world is being decided - but I'll wind it up here and just urge anyone that enjoys movies that encourage one to think to seek out Dr Strangelove  or How I learned to stop worrying and love the Bomb.

Here, I believe, one of the films key themes and elements are revealed - Ripper tells Mandrake that he first became aware of the Communist 'conspiricy' during the physical act of love - Ripper goes on to explain (in rather cryptic terms) that after failing to become aroused, or perhaps losing his erection, he came to realise that his bodily fluids were being taken or contaminated. He then goes to some pains to make it clear that the problem had *not* happened again, and that women still found him 'powerful'.So in essence, Ripper's failure to cope with his own compromised masculinity led to his insanity and subsequent order to attack the 'Russkies' !! So a madman has potentially started world war 3. No real surprise there, as the focus turns to the initially unseen General Buck Turgidson - the General is at first unconcerned over a phone call from a base commander, accepted by his bathing-beauty 'secretary', and continues his business in the 'powder room' for a painfully long time before finally deigning to speak to the worried base commander himself.Turgidson decides the situation is serious enough to warrant leaving his young, barely-clad lady friend in their hotel room whilst he puts in a little overtime in the War Room. In a later scene, Ms. Scott, his secretary, thoughtlessly rings Turgidson in the War Room - before hanging-up, Turgidson ever-so-briefly reflects upon the precarious situation at hand and thoughtfully advises Ms. Scott not to forget to say her prayers ...Hilarity and double-speak ensues throughout the entire first War Room scene, Turgidson's zealousness to turn the accidental encroachment on soviet airspace into a full scale strike is demented logic at its finest. Somewhat fortunately, the President, once again played by Peter Sellers, is less of a war-monger than the General, and he enlists the aid of the somewhat reluctant Russian ambassador to contact the Russian Premier, the apparently drunk Dimitri Kissoff. Sellers one-sided conversation with Kissoff is a side-splitter, desperate not to offend the Premier whilst still trying to gently break the news of impending air strikes. The Russians go one-up on the Yanks though, when it comes to light that they have constructed a 'Doomsday device', which is deadly enough to pretty much f*ck up the world - if the rogue B-52's commissioned by Ripper accomplish their mission, they will unwittingly be activating the Doomsday device ! This is when Sellers' third, and most bizarre, character is introduced, the titular Dr. Strangelove. As he 'helpfully' points out, a Doomsday device is a great deterrent for Nuclear War - er, provided the rest of the World is aware of the *threat* first ! However, as the Russian Ambassador points out, the existence of the Doomsday device hadn't been announced to that stage as the Premier was due to announce it at an upcoming conference, due to his love of 'suprises' hehehe. And so it's all set-up for a tense finale, as Mandrake tries to obtain vital codes from General Ripper to recall the B-52's, President Muffley and his cohorts try to work with the Russian government to blow their own men out of the sky to avoid mass destruction, and a B-52 flown by Major 'King' Kong attempts to deliver it's mother lode upon it's intended target before they're shot out of the sky.I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed this film, it's sharp humour, it's psychological profiles of the egomaniacs that would end the world, their sexual insecurity, the petty bickering over relatively insignificant matters while the fate of the world is being decided - but I'll wind it up here and just urge anyone that enjoys movies that encourage one to think to seek out Dr Strangelove  or How I learned to stop worrying and love the Bomb.

The scenes in the B-52, and the scenes involving the army trying to take control back of a base-gone-loco have an almost newsreel documentary feel to them The contrast between the serious, reportage-style direction and the at times over-the-top characters and dialogue works brilliantly to keep the movie focused and the sense of impending disaster palpable, whilst still allowing the mostly subtle humour to play out. Fairly early in the film, we're given a close up shot of General Ripper's brooding face from an unusual angle, the camera looking up at his visage as if his face were a huge, insurmountable rock - as soon as this superb shot revealed itself I had the uneasy feeling that Ripper might be a bit 'funny' as President Muffley later explains.The only person in a position to get through to Ripper through his apparent madness is Captain Mandrake, one of the three characters to appear in the film to be portrayed by Peter Sellers.

And Thunderball outshines Goldfinger in the vital categories by which a Bond film is measured The women Bond interacts with (Claudine Auger, Luciana Paluzzi, Martine Beswick, Rose Alba) are more beautiful and plentiful, and their wardrobes are more sexy. The dialog is better, with more good quips and wry humor than Goldfinger. The villains are more memorable (see the Austin Powers movies if you can't figure this out). The location was more exotic (watching the Bahamas as a backdrop beats the heck out of the same old U.S.A. most movies take place in.) And the Q-type gadgets were numerous but took nothing away from Bond's bravado.This movie bears some similarities on the surface to Dr. No, the first official Bond movie -- the Thunderball story supposedly was selected for the first Bond film at one point -- but Thunderball has considerably more polish to it than Dr. No did. One can forgive the shortcomings of Dr. No, which had a more modest budget at a time when no one could accurately forecast the appeal of a Bond film. But Thunderball was the apex of what a Bond movie could be. The plot of Thunderball also got about as realistic and serious as Bond movies ever did, before the genre plunged into self-satirizing from the 1970s on.That stated, the movie is not flawless. (No Bond movie is, for that matter.) I had to have some reason to give it nine stars and not tenContinuity problem In an underwater fight near the end of the movie, Bond loses his blue dive mask. He grabs a black dive mask from a nearby villain, puts it on and clears it, and...surprise! Next time we see Bond's face, his mask is blue. I suppose we can rationalize that, as movie viewers, we just didn't see a moment where Bond used the black mask to locate and recover his blue one. Maybe Bond is concerned that he'll be mistaken for a bad guy if he keeps the black mask?Stretching reality Bond and Domino are airlifted from a raft at the film's end by a moving airplane that hooks the balloon and tether from the raft. I hope there is a lot of elastic in that line (talk about sudden acceleration), and I would like to know how they'll be reeled in when the tether was captured at the plane's nose. I can only imagine that the plane has some sort of track under the nose that can carry the cable back to a receiving area in the plane's belly.Stretching reality again Bond struggles with thugs underwater, beneath the Disco Volante. Then, as he swims away from the scene, grenades are dropped overboard. We can only imagine that several minutes of Bond's progress towards shore are edited out here, as the concussion of a grenade underwater would kill Bond at a close proximity, stun him from further away, and still deafen him permanently from a still further distance. Grenades under water are hazardous over a greater distance than they are above water.Now, to address other common issues people have with the movieThe frequently reported missing bombs and scientist There are no missing bombs. The para-trooping scuba force would have recovered one of the bombs by gradually overpowering the Spectre scuba divers. This isn't highlighted during the film, but is a logical assumption. The second bomb may have been among the remains of the Disco Volante, and would not have exploded in its full mushroom-cloud potential unless properly detonated. The Disco Volante's demise might constitute the first dirty bomb explosion, possibly scattering radioactive material on the small island that the ship hit. This might spell bad news for the missing scientist, who one can assume swam to shore on one of the small islands or atolls nearby, rather than spoiling Bond's final intimate moments with Domino by joining them in the raft. If the second bomb was not loaded on board the Disco Volante, it should turn up in the underwater cave that was used to store the bombs earlier in the movie.Why does Bond get away at the Junkanoo? Here, Fiona Volpe dies because Bond, while dancing with her, turns her toward the gun at the last second. (Bond's a lucky guy, once again...but what a waste of a sexy body!) The gunshot sound is masked supposedly by the deafening bongo beats from the band. The mystery for many is why the bad guys scurry away afterward, when they could simply take another shot at Bond. Considering that their cover (the loud bongo beats) is over, and no one has yet noticed the fatality, the Spectre thugs have the option to depart unnoticed, or to make a scene. They immediately take advantage of the chance to depart. Bond could have called attention to them and to Fiona's death, and whether or not Bond took any gunfire from the thugs, the police would then be alerted. Had the Spectre thugs not decided to get a head start home, they might not have been able to escape town, and at the very least, they might have had to shoot it out with police. That kind of a screw-up, even if the thugs made it back to Palmyra, would probably invite some quality time with Largo's sharks. It was far easier for the group to return quietly and report that Fiona was the one who screwed up, and that Bond killed her. Bond simply exercised a similar option to keep quiet, not wanting to spend the night answering questions in a Nassau police station.

Paris, Texas is very much a character driven story and it follows the account of a man that wanders out of the hot desert sun with an acute case of amnesia. When his brother, Walt, finds him, he helps him to remember his life, and we then watch as our protagonist rekindles his former relationships first with son, and then with the mother of his child. Wim Wenders handles this story with the utmost skill, and it works thanks to the tentative way that he portrays the characters to the audience. Just like the town of it's title; Paris, Texas is basically a film about being lost. I (and I'm sure many other people) didn't even realise that there was a place called Paris in the middle of Texas, and this little place is symbolic of the substance that is at the core of this movie.The film doesn't benefit from any big name actors, but the actors in the movie do give it their all and ensure that it doesn't fall down on the acting side. Harry Dean Stanton takes the lead role, and does a good job in, at first, portraying a man consumed with amnesia; and then consumed with the time he has lost. Nastassja Kinski is the only member of the cast that has a really notable list of film credits other than this movie, but ironically she has the least screen time of the five leads. Every minute she is on screen is a delight, however, and she lights up the screen with both of her talents; looks and acting ability. The young Hunter Carson gives a rare child performance; i.e. one that isn't incredibly annoying, but strangely he didn't appear in very many movies after this one. The climax to the tale is more than satisfying, and is easily one of the most haunting and potent I've ever seen in a film. Wenders shows his talent with both the execution and the implications of it, and it's a satisfying end to a very satisfying movie. Recommended.

Marnau's 1922 silent adaptation remains the greatest film adaptation of Bram Stoker's tale. Ironically, the film was unauthorised and was eagerly sought to be destroyed by Stoker's widow which makes its latter-day rediscovery and restoration all the more appreciable. Opting for a folkloric depiction of the vampire, the film presents one of the screen's most menacing figures, the hideous Count Orlok (Max Schreck), far removed from the suave urbanity of the succeeding incarnations that we have grown used to. The story is the same a naive young estate agent ventures to Transylvania in order to secure the bloodthirsty aristocrat's move to his home town where strange happenings are occurring. Yet, what makes Nosferatu the definitive Dracula movie is its grandiose air of menace, atmosphere and fascination which few films ever have rivalled. For its time, the film is stunningly cinematic with its use of location and parallel crosscutting whilst Marnau assembles a gallery of unforgettable and chilling shots, not least the sight of a shadowed Orlok creeping swiftly upstairs ready to devour his victim. Eighty years down the line, Marnau's work firmly stands as a superior piece of silent cinema as well as one of the definitive horror classics.

Rocky I and II are tremendous films that focus more on Rocky and Adrian's love for one another and their journey from unhappiness to complete fulfillment. Rocky IV while visually stunning, is verging on SCI-FI it is so unrealistic( I still can't get over 2000PSI!!) and Rocky V makes the whole journey seem almost worthless. But the third film in my opinion has the perfect blend. From the supercharged Eye of the Tiger opening to the classic Rocky v Apollo ending, this film just does not let up. All of the cast act their socks off here, none more so than Stallone himself. The scene of Mickey's death after Rocky's destruction at the hands of Clubber Lang is brilliant- you can feel the genuine emotion Stallone has for Mickey's character and the chemistry between Meredith and Stallone is there up to the very last scene they had together. But the Masterstroke here lies in making Apollo a far more central character after Mickey's death. Carl Weathers pulls of a huge feat in this film in that he fills Meredith's shoes so to speak- not an easy job when you consider just how important Mickey is to the Rocky films. WOW, all of this and I still haven't even mentioned CLUBBER! Clubber Lang is a great adversary for Rocky and the power and intensity his character displays in the ring is ferocious. The second fight between Rocky and Clubber is just breathtaking, the pace of the fight is electric, some of the camera work makes you feel like you are literally in the ring with these two warriors. And more importantly here we see Balboa at his absolute peak- technically and physically, he actually looks and fights like a man who is the BEST fighter in the world. Rocky evolves in this film into a boxer with speed, skill, intelligence and power. A triumph of a movie that I would recommend to anyone with the slightest interest in being entertained!

Oustanding cinematography and superior acting only complement a well crafted script and editing. The most compelling reason to see this, despite what critics may say, is the script's deep reaching commentary on modern society. The way that the run of everyday, 9-5 work, consumer based life slowly erodes dreams and passion, the anger that stirs beneath that, and becomes rage in some people is precisely exemplified by this story. Full of twists and turns, the plot doesn't stand alone, but really revolves around the theme of consumer anger. All the while being a hopeful piece, I think this movie really shines a light into a standard area of denial in society. Namely; that the stuff you own, ends up owning you. Like all good debate though, the script presents both sides of the issue, and by the time the movie ends, you believe in love again, but you can also understand why some of the wackos snap on occasion, and lash out at just about anyone they can find. It is tough to write about the source of frustration that causes some people to go postal, but Fight Club delivers that in a compelling, can't help but look at the traffic accident kind of way.That's not to say the film is just a theme piece though. I loved the edgy, gritty shots and interesting angles that the director uses for effect. The overall dark, dirty and rainy feel to the pic is reminiscent of the Ridley Scott movies, Blade Runner, and maybe Black Rain. Fincher clearly has perfected his craft since Se7en, as good as that movie was.I usually guess the ending in almost all movies, this one is one of the rare ones that had me going through the journey along with the characters.

I live in Croatia where waves are basically too small for surfing so surfing has not developed into a popular sport here,there are no surf shops and besides myself I have never met anyone who's into soul surfing and everything about it.Not being able to surf here I have spent last 5 years learning about surf culture and history reading magazine articles searching the net about surfing, trying to find movies about surfing...For me, and for any other surfer there is no such a thing as a bad movie about surfing.If it speaks about it, if there are scenes of surfing ...its good enough for me, but Point Break was really great. Compliments for the director,I thing that timing was great,every death on this movie was timed perfectly,roach, Nathaniel and grommet were great and the lines are amazing.I especially liked that silent spiritual music while Bodhi surfed and Tyler talked about him. Anyway what I wanted to say is that I watched this movie for more than 500 times now and for me, the only Croatian surf stoked loner its kind of comforting to hope that somewhere on the beaches of L.A. there are groups of surfers just like Bodhi and guys(except for robbing banks part),soul surfers who live for riding waves and dream of next awakening of senses they'll experience in ocean.It also makes me sad that this movie isn't reality cause I really think they made Bodhi great,I really have found myself in him and it would be great to be in his crew.My question is , if anyone who's reading this is from California, is how are surfers there, are soul surfers majority, and are there any gays like Bodhi?I'm coming to Cali next school year to be a senior on a high school exchange program(Face the world foundation)but I'm not sure exactly where in Cali cause they haven't found host family yet but I'm hoping for Huntington Beach,I don't know why but that town is my very favorite place in the world.
