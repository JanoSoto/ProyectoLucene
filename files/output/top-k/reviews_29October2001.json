In spite of this trend, in 1993 Turner Movie released Gettysburg, a large-scale epic film depicting the decisive 1863 Civil War battle.  When I saw this film for the first time back in 1993, I thought that it is an excellent film although not perfect.   The cast members were generally excellent.  Although some professional critics gave negative comments about Martin Sheen's portrayal of Gen. Robert E. Lee, I felt that Sheen did a great job of depicting this Civil War general.  I still clearly remember the nobility of Sheen's Lee when he answered his soldiers' cheer of  `Lee! Lee! Lee!' Tom Berenger, who is really at home playing gung-ho characters, superbly played Gen. Long-street, a large, tacit man.  Sam Shepherd played the forgotten hero of Gettysburg, Brigadier Gen. John Buford, quietly and convincingly.  Jeff Bridges was excellent as the dauntless scholar-soldier, Col. (later Major General) Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who won the skirmish on the Big Round Top which, some historians say, changed the entire course of the Battle of Gettysburg and ultimately the Civil War.  Bridges played this quiet ex-college professor, who immediately went back to teaching after the Civil War, so ef-fectively that I could feel this scholar-soldier's courage and strength through his performance. I was glad to see Buck Taylor, whom I have not seen for a long time.  (He was Newly O'Brien in the TV series Gun-smoke.)  Thanks to the great performance of the cast members, I was not once bored during the entire 4-hour duration of this very long film. The battle scenes were staged competently. Unlike many other films, this movie was not myopic in its portrayal of battle scenes.  Many other war movies look awfully myopic because the directors have to make a limited number of extras to look like tens of thousands of soldiers; therefore, they can rarely use the panoramic long shot.  However, for this film, the director assembled thousands of Civil War re-enacters and, therefore, could use many panoramic long shots.  For example, Pickett's charge (estimated to be 15,000 strong historically) absolutely came to life in this film.  I knew about this ill-fated charge since I was only about eight; nevertheless, until I saw this film, it was merely a vague description in pages of history books.  It was re-enacted magnificently in this film with approximately 5000 Civil-War re-enacters. There are many good points about the script.   I am happy to see that the creative minds behind this film cared about historical accuracies unlike many other Hollywood screenwriters.  This film was relatively faithful to the history and the book Killer Angels.  (Although Michael Schaara's Killer Angels is relatively accurate historically, the author did take some liberties with history--including some of the positions of the Union troops during the battle.)  Even though this movie was depicted largely from the point of view of some famous historical figures like Gen. Lee and Longstreet, many parts of this film was seen through the eyes of Col. Joshua Chamberlain, a historical character and a regular Joe who turned into a tiger when confronted by hundreds of screaming Confederates.  He is a sympathetic but heroic character whom an average moviegoer can easily relate to.  No screenwriter could have created a more ideal movie character than Col. Chamberlain, but he is a real human being who lived until just before World War I.  (This is a good lesson for many Hollywood writers who are known to frequently add unnecessary and boring fictional characters to historical epics. By adding fictional characters, the historical epic loses authenticity.  Moreover, there are usually no need to add fictional characters to history-based dramas.  Many of the historical figures--including Col. Chamberlain--are fascinating people, much more interesting than most of Hollywood's fictional characters.) Unfortunately, the script also has some Achilles' heels.  For some inexplicable reason, the screenwriters made many of the lines of the film's characters seem sermon-like and unnatural.  Take for instance, the conversation between Gen. Armistead and Lt. Colonel Freemantle just before Pickett's charge.  Armistead's lines were so stilted and unnatural.  He sounded more like a politician making a speech to a large audience or a preacher making a big Sunday sermon.  Because of the time constraint of a theatrical movie, many interesting subplots and story lines of the novel Killer Angels were deleted from the film.  (For example, the meeting between Longstreet and a shadowy pro-Confederate spy or the scene in which Gen. Meade and his staff were having a sumptuous meal oblivious to his starving men.)   To portray many of these interesting story lines, Turner Movie should have made `Gettysburg' into a ten-hour TV mini-series. Although not perfect, Gettysburg is a fine historical epic film.  I highly recommend this film.

The New York interiors are beautifully-rendered, and both Polanski's cast is to be thanked for breathing life into his own tepid script. This movie is not for impatient. It moves very slow, but if one pays attention to the various plot details, it will have you biting your nails throughout. Rosemary's Baby reels you in almost from the very beginning and sets you squarely on the side of the protagonist, the beautiful Mia Farrow in a very believable, subtle performance. There is great dramatic irony in the horror's complex discovery plot -- you find yourself almost screaming at the film because Rosemary is too naive and charmingly honest to suspect what the audience has already gathered that there are terrible forces and terrible people out to get her.The very fact that you root so hard for Rosemary -- and believe so much in her integrity -- makes the film's ludicrously-scripted and childishly-shot ending all the more trite and hard to follow. I won't give it away, it's too silly for anything but the actual experience, but suffice it to say that whether or not you agree with the decisions that are made, they are a hard pill to swallow.

Come on people!I enjoyed watching Julianna Moore as much as a lot of you probably enjoyed watching Tom Cruise, but let's not get carried away in movie star hype. This movie had a lot of big names and quite a few excellent performances, but at it's core there is a failed story.

The beginning set the pace and the performances of the actors drew us in. Yes, by the time that amphibians start raining from the sky, we really care about these characters.  Good job, Mr. Writer.  But wait, did I just say that amphibians started falling from the sky?I believe that there are two prevailing schools of thought (excuse the cliché) in regards to this movie.  One is that the frog storm was a satirical device to show the futility of life and that despite the torments of our individual lives, none of it really matters on a cosmic level. Maybe the writer is telling us that things may be bad, but at least frogs aren't falling from the sky.The second school of thought would be that the writer wrote an amazing story but couldn't close the deal.  Every writer knows that it is easier to conceive Revelations than it is to write Armageddon.  Yeah, you may have a great story, but that does not guarantee that you will have an ending to match.  In truth, the better the story, the harder it is to come up with an ending.  When you start a tale, you make a promise to the audience.  You essentially say, bear with me for awhile, suspend disbelief, give me a few hours of your life (or three hours and eight minutes in this case.)  You promise the audience that their investment of time will reap huge rewards. Then you introduce them to characters and draw them into situations.  You make them feel something and more eagerly anticipate some resolution.  Now you are promising them that not only their time, but their emotional investment will all be worth it.  The longer the film, the more engrossing situations, the better the acting, serves to raise the stakes.  Before closing credits roll, people begin to have remembrances of the great stories of Dickens, Shakespeare and Capote.  So all that is left is to pay the piper, close the story with a bang and send them home crying.  Should be simple right?Obviously not!  Maybe you realize somewhere along the way that you have written a story bigger than you are.  Maybe you have started Great Expectations and you are only able to finish with Pee Wee's big adventure. The disappointed audiences will feast upon the carcass of you that the film credits leave behind.  That's if they even hear your tale after word of it's failure gets out.  So what do you do?

We had not heard of her before, (we have not seen Dr Doolittle) ...  but it seemed to us absolutely right to cast a lithe and graceful former ballerina in the role of an elf.

I have fairly mainstream tastes, and in terms of plot, dialogue, lack of characterisation and so on, it is certainly no worse a film than Star Wars The Phantom Menace or one of the Die Hard films - again, not exactly high-brow films but thoroughly enjoyable nevertheless, and certainly the kind of film I like to watch to relax.Indeed, some elements in this film are outstanding the costumes, the gothic imagery, the real-life locations in Prague (dig that library!).Among the actors, we were particularly impressed by Justin Whalin, who made a fine and believable young hero, without any of the brattish qualities that a lot of actors in similar roles have had (think Mark Hamill), also by Kristen Wilson who is simply a delight for the eyes.  We had not heard of her before, (we have not seen Dr Doolittle) ...  but it seemed to us absolutely right to cast a lithe and graceful former ballerina in the role of an elf.  Or should that be a half-elf, perhaps?  It was not clear why Norda and Halvath looked significantly different from the other elves unless they were half-elves. In terms of accurate portrayal of D&D the game, I very much liked the fact that all the characters had a clearly defined class; the rivalry between different character classes; the clear alignment of characters (chaotic good, lawful evil etc); the fact that magic users needed ingredients (e.g. magic dust used by Marina Pretensa) for their spells; all the traps; the 'game balance' that is to say that there were few monsters and that most 'opponents' were humans\/humanoids; the fact that Profion had a familiar.   I did not think it was accurate that a thief (Snails) should be clumsy, nor that characters who were supposed to be of low levels of experience (Pretensa, Snails and Ridley) had so many high level abilities - Ridley's excellent fighting skills, Pretensa's powerful spells.  Also I found the presence of what were apparently orcs in the tavern to be a trifle bizarre.Having watched this on DVD, one thing stands out, though, and that is that some inexplicable and, can I say, inept cuts were made in producing the final print.  Several key scenes which are absolutely necessary to understand the plot have been cut - one where Elwood Gutworthy (the dwarf) introduces himself to the rest of the party, one where Ridley and Pretensa are actually inside the scroll and given a map of how to find the Rod, one where the romantic interest between Norda and Snails is developed.  There is no apparent reason for these cuts - certainly the quality of the deleted scenes on the DVD is just as good as the rest (although of course they have not received post-production processes - you can actually see the sudden transition from polished to less-polished in the Norda\/Snails scene).  If other reviewers have given the film low ratings because of these cuts, I can perhaps understand it ...And to any director\/editor\/studio thinking of cutting scenes as a result of test audience feedback, I have a piece of advice for you Don't.  (For a good example of why this is not a good idea, see the 'Making of' feature on Twelve Monkeys.)

Normally, such glossy, seemingly shallow fare would best be avoided, but Moulin Rouge is an exception. And a damn good one at that.*small spoilers*Ewan McGregor is Christian, a romantic young poet with a knack for improvising song lyrics, a talent that brings him (via some drunken bohemians) to the Moulin Rouge - a nightclub for the rich and the beautiful, a whirlwind of sex and glamour. After a case of (that old screwball chestnut) mistaken identity, Christian ends up inadvertently falling for (and winning over) the queen bee of the Moulin Rouge - Nicole Kidman's courtesan Satine. Their romance is cemented in a visually stunning (and well sung) performance of Elton John's 'Your Song', but (as with all romances) their love is threatened, in this case by a whining rodent of a Duke (Richard Roxburgh). He wants Satine and seeing as Zidler (Jim Broadbent), the owner of the Moulin Rouge, needs the Duke's financing, he agrees to hand his star attraction over.The narrative is as dull and unoriginal as that. As far as the story is concerned, Moulin Rouge is poor. But this, surprisingly, doesn't seem to matter much. The story is secondary, a mere backdrop for Luhrmann to stage extraordinary musical numbers, and to display a range of emotions in the most glamorous and dazzling ways possible. If his attempts at doing so had fallen flat (none do), then this film would have been disastrous, like a 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' without the wryness and the controversy.Luhrmann delivered us an overly familiar story for a reason this film is so packed with music, song, extravagant camera angles and sheer personality that an original story could have been overload. What Luhrmann has given us instead is a fantastic, original idea. The anachronistic use of familiar music is a pure success. The sentiments of each song represent what the Moulin Rouge was; a place of freedom, energy and lust (this is best shown in the introduction to the nightclub, when Luhrmann splices 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', 'Lady Marmalade' and 'Diamond Dogs' with a manic reworking of the Can Can).The film's unrelenting energy may overwhelm some, and it NEVER lets up. This can be seen as a virtue, but if you're unprepared for it, it could work the other way.Whether you love Moulin Rouge for its anachronism and explosiveness, or if you hate it, it can't be denied that Moulin Rouge is made by people with talent and vision. Luhrmann puts on a grand show, and his actors serve him very well indeed.Roxburgh copes well with the cliched Duke, while Broadbent is completely charismatic as Zidler. In the leads, Kidman and McGregor are outstanding. Although her vocals shake on the odd occasion, Kidman demands to be watched - her startling rendition of 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend' is magnificent, reminiscent of Marlene Dietrich, but she gleefully ditches the sophistication when she partakes wonderfully in the impromptu song-and-dance pitch for a play. McGregor is also enchanting as he perfectly captures the dreamy-eyed, romantic optimism of Christian. His voice is stunning, and he is an ideal hero. Broadbent, Kidman and McGregor all deserve Oscar noms for their work, and I wouldn't be surprised if Kidman takes one home.Other scenes to watch out for the wonderfully executed tango to 'Roxanne', the show-stopping 'Like A Virgin' routine, a witty exchange of song lyrics between Kidman & McGregor atop a huge bejewelled elephant, and an hilarious cameo from Kylie Minogue as a green sprite with a fondness for 'The Sound of Music'.Moulin Rouge takes advantage of the magic of cinema, a concept that is so often talked about, but rarely used with such conviction, originality and ambition.

I don't even want to think how much money was spent on it.Since I wasted a part of my life watching this pathetic mess of a film, it's only fair that I make up for it by pointing out its flaws(this should be very therapeutic).********THERE ARE SPOILERS INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW********************Why when the helicopter crashed into the lab did the explosions go on for around 5 minutes??? Were they carrying nitroglycerine? I thought an H-bomb had been dropped on the site when I saw that mushroom cloud. Isn't there room for just a little bit of reality?It's summer entertainment, sit back and enjoy, they saySorry guys, this film can't have it both ways. It tries to throw up an interesting moral dilemma with the Alzheimer's cure, then proceeds to do everything with complete disregard for the laws of science and basic intelligence.Why should LL Cool J throwing a match into a flooded kitchen(with water I presumed), set off an explosion large enough to level a small island??As for the graphics, I have come up with more realistic looking things using Paintbrush. Unlike in Jaws where you see in graphic detail Quint being savaged, here they make the attacks as quick as possible when they can get away with it. Both sea, shark and victim instantly transform into badly realised cartoon animations during the 0.5 seconds the attack takes place. We are supposed to think Wow, what fast sharks!! Instead we think Which program did they use to come up with that? I think I'll stay away from itI can imagine the programmer explaining how he got the attacks looking so realisticProgrammer Well you click on this grey shark-like thing using the mouseRenny O.KProgrammer With your finger still pressed down, move it back and forth really, really, really quicklyRenny Neat!Programmer Now move the cartoon figure behind the shark-like figure, so it looks like its been eaten..Renny Incredible!!! How did you come up with that??!!Programmer Practice..... Now click on the paintbrush and click on red.   Renny For blood?Programmer (after long pause) Yes.Renny Thanks guys! Here's 25 million dollars, you earned it!Samuel L.Jackson's death was funny, but predictable.  Also Superman was in this film. That was the name I decided to give Mr obvious hero as soon as I saw him holding a shark back with the harpoon he fired(any normal human would be dragged into the water). Near the end when he somersaulted underwater over the attacking shark to grab onto its fin and hitch a ride(as he did earlier without breaking a sweat) - my brain had already shut down. Belief had been suspended to the point that I would have accepted him running across the water and physically strangling the sharks to death.In my opinion everyone died in this film. LL Cool J was dragged savagely by the shark for ages before escaping(a few bandages should see to that..) HE SHOULD BE IN PIECES!!!! Superman takes a harpoon to the leg with no apparent effect. He's even able to make a few jokes afterwards(you hit me!!!! Ho Ho Ho) Well forgive me for not sharing in this brilliant moment of humour but your leg should be floating in the ocean and you should be bleeding to death.I suppose if the scientist(Saffron Burrows) can rip that thick cable from the wall, she can survive being electrocuted just by standing on a WET_SUIT(and a damp one at that). At least some sense of consistency(??)Now for the super-smart sharks. If you made my brain five times larger I would not gain an instant understanding of quantum physics. I would still have to learn it(though I could probably do it faster).Why these sharks have such great knowledge of battle tactics(?), cameras(?!) and cooking(Roast LL Cool J anyone?) is not explained. I did laugh when I imagined the sharks gathering round to discuss what their next move would be when they weren't in the picture.  Shark 1Right, so you pretend to be under anaesthetic, throw the guy through the window, disable the cameras, corner them - and that's dinner for three   Shark 2The logistics of such a plan are debatable. If the window was designed to withstand such high pressure at that depth and large creature inevitably bumping into it - what makes you think that throwing the injured guy into it will break it?Shark 3 Which part of dinner for three didn't you understand?I think even if they had made the brains of the sharks five times smaller they would have made easy work of this group of half wits. By the way, an oven door is harder to break than a steel gate or the hull of a boat.

How did you come up with that??!!Programmer Practice..... Now click on the paintbrush and click on red.   Renny For blood?Programmer (after long pause) Yes.Renny Thanks guys! Here's 25 million dollars, you earned it!Samuel L.Jackson's death was funny, but predictable.  Also Superman was in this film. That was the name I decided to give Mr obvious hero as soon as I saw him holding a shark back with the harpoon he fired(any normal human would be dragged into the water). Near the end when he somersaulted underwater over the attacking shark to grab onto its fin and hitch a ride(as he did earlier without breaking a sweat) - my brain had already shut down. Belief had been suspended to the point that I would have accepted him running across the water and physically strangling the sharks to death.In my opinion everyone died in this film. LL Cool J was dragged savagely by the shark for ages before escaping(a few bandages should see to that..) HE SHOULD BE IN PIECES!!!! Superman takes a harpoon to the leg with no apparent effect. He's even able to make a few jokes afterwards(you hit me!!!! Ho Ho Ho) Well forgive me for not sharing in this brilliant moment of humour but your leg should be floating in the ocean and you should be bleeding to death.I suppose if the scientist(Saffron Burrows) can rip that thick cable from the wall, she can survive being electrocuted just by standing on a WET_SUIT(and a damp one at that). At least some sense of consistency(??)Now for the super-smart sharks. If you made my brain five times larger I would not gain an instant understanding of quantum physics. I would still have to learn it(though I could probably do it faster).Why these sharks have such great knowledge of battle tactics(?), cameras(?!) and cooking(Roast LL Cool J anyone?) is not explained. I did laugh when I imagined the sharks gathering round to discuss what their next move would be when they weren't in the picture.  Shark 1Right, so you pretend to be under anaesthetic, throw the guy through the window, disable the cameras, corner them - and that's dinner for three   Shark 2The logistics of such a plan are debatable. If the window was designed to withstand such high pressure at that depth and large creature inevitably bumping into it - what makes you think that throwing the injured guy into it will break it?Shark 3 Which part of dinner for three didn't you understand?I think even if they had made the brains of the sharks five times smaller they would have made easy work of this group of half wits.
