Which would you put your hard-earned savings on? What would be the odds? These are all some tough questions that I had hoped would be answered while watching the drama Love & Basketball. At first I thought this was going to be a versus film, but instead it turned out to be a comparison piece. Love & Basketball did something that most sports films only dream of accomplishing, creating a strong connection between the emotion on the court and the emotions of life. Sadly, this is the only element that it successfully accomplished, as most of it was more a dribble of clichés coupled by some poorly performed dunks. The acting was decent, perhaps a bit too accentuated for the surroundings, but it was the characters that just seemed oddly mismatched. I felt as if I was watching and trying to get excited for a High School Junior Varsity game, when I honestly should have been focusing on a stronger, more defined team. There was some meat to this film, but you had to eat around the gristle to get there, and that wasn't enjoyable in the least. Love & Basketball was fun to watch, but didn't quite create that spark that was needed to electrify the court.Let's begin with Spike Lee. Now, I don't like to name drop in these reviews, but I am a big fan of Lee's work. I believe his films are some of the most underrated films in Hollywood. He is hard hitting, in your face, and extremely rough, but for me it works. I have not been disappointed with any of his work. I am however, disappointed with his involvement in this film. With Lee involved as a producer, I was expecting a much grittier portrayal of this basketball love. I wanted to see a better-defined connection between the two themes, but instead what I was handed was a chaotic bowl of spaghetti, with moments interweaving with other, non-connective moments. It was devastating to watch. Needless to say, Lee should have put his chops more into this film. It could have been dark, it could have been honest, but instead we were left with a sea of fouls, bad dribbles, and tons of air balls.The acting could have been stronger. I will agree that Omar Epps is a very talented player in Hollywood, but I do not think that he had a full understanding of this character. There were moments in Love & Basketball where I could see greatness emerging from Epps, sadly there were more scenes that just felt like they should be flushed with the rest of the garbage. Monica, aka Sanaa Lathan, could have been a stronger feminine voice. It was encouraging to see someone strive for their dreams, to see the counter-balance of how the world of basketball treats males and females differently, but she just wasn't strong enough. She balanced too much on Quincy (Epps) and ultimately it created a shallow character. Secondly, both of these characters came from wealthy homes. I don't know if you noticed, but both houses were beautiful and very upper class &#133; so where did that gangsta attitude come from? I didn't feel like it matched their characters well at all. I felt that it was used because director Gina Prince-Bythewood was trying to reach out towards a different audience than what should have been attempted. It was these types of inconsistencies that hurt this film. It wasn't just in the characters, but also in the story.There are huge scenes that were supposed to be very emotional and very triumphant that just floundered in this film because they were either 1) rushed or 2) never developed. This hurt, because by the time this film is nearing its completion, no matter how bad you think it is so far, you do feel a connection with these characters. You do want to see some resolution, and for that I can only applaud everyone's work. Unlike in some Hollywood films, you do feel connection to these two hearts. You feel compassion and devotion to their dreams and downfalls, but intermixed are these massive scenes of confusion. For example, near the end of the film, Monica and her mother have a very emotional talk. If this entire scene didn't arrive right out of mid air, than perhaps I would have been more excited about the tender moment, but it just seemed like Alfre Woodard needed a moment to demonstrate her acting chops. There wasn't enough development between Monica and her father, a key element that I believe should have been explored deeper. He understood her dreams, yet did nothing to support them. It seemed like it was a walking double negative that desperately needed more filling. Finally, where did the sister go midway through the film? We took all this time to develop the family, yet just as quickly as they go to college, we ignore them. Gina Prince-Bythewood had too much happening and didn't know how to handle the pressures.Overall, I will float down the center of the court for this film. Love & Basketball tried hard to develop this beautiful love relationship derived from the sport of basketball, but sadly, there were too many unneeded players on the court. The father side-story was worthless, as was all scenes dealing with Monica's family. The overall story was decent, but using the power of Spike Lee, there should have been more grit, more dirt, less plastic Hollywood. Was the director worried about going to far with this film? In my opinion, she should have reached for the sky and transformed this film into this emotional powerhouse. Instead, for some strange reason, I felt as if I was watching a sappy version of Bring It On. Is that bad of me?

There were moments in Love & Basketball where I could see greatness emerging from Epps, sadly there were more scenes that just felt like they should be flushed with the rest of the garbage. Monica, aka Sanaa Lathan, could have been a stronger feminine voice. It was encouraging to see someone strive for their dreams, to see the counter-balance of how the world of basketball treats males and females differently, but she just wasn't strong enough. She balanced too much on Quincy (Epps) and ultimately it created a shallow character. Secondly, both of these characters came from wealthy homes. I don't know if you noticed, but both houses were beautiful and very upper class &#133; so where did that gangsta attitude come from? I didn't feel like it matched their characters well at all. I felt that it was used because director Gina Prince-Bythewood was trying to reach out towards a different audience than what should have been attempted. It was these types of inconsistencies that hurt this film. It wasn't just in the characters, but also in the story.There are huge scenes that were supposed to be very emotional and very triumphant that just floundered in this film because they were either 1) rushed or 2) never developed. This hurt, because by the time this film is nearing its completion, no matter how bad you think it is so far, you do feel a connection with these characters. You do want to see some resolution, and for that I can only applaud everyone's work. Unlike in some Hollywood films, you do feel connection to these two hearts. You feel compassion and devotion to their dreams and downfalls, but intermixed are these massive scenes of confusion. For example, near the end of the film, Monica and her mother have a very emotional talk. If this entire scene didn't arrive right out of mid air, than perhaps I would have been more excited about the tender moment, but it just seemed like Alfre Woodard needed a moment to demonstrate her acting chops. There wasn't enough development between Monica and her father, a key element that I believe should have been explored deeper. He understood her dreams, yet did nothing to support them. It seemed like it was a walking double negative that desperately needed more filling. Finally, where did the sister go midway through the film? We took all this time to develop the family, yet just as quickly as they go to college, we ignore them. Gina Prince-Bythewood had too much happening and didn't know how to handle the pressures.Overall, I will float down the center of the court for this film. Love & Basketball tried hard to develop this beautiful love relationship derived from the sport of basketball, but sadly, there were too many unneeded players on the court. The father side-story was worthless, as was all scenes dealing with Monica's family. The overall story was decent, but using the power of Spike Lee, there should have been more grit, more dirt, less plastic Hollywood. Was the director worried about going to far with this film? In my opinion, she should have reached for the sky and transformed this film into this emotional powerhouse. Instead, for some strange reason, I felt as if I was watching a sappy version of Bring It On. Is that bad of me?

Which would you put your hard-earned savings on? What would be the odds? These are all some tough questions that I had hoped would be answered while watching the drama Love & Basketball. At first I thought this was going to be a versus film, but instead it turned out to be a comparison piece. Love & Basketball did something that most sports films only dream of accomplishing, creating a strong connection between the emotion on the court and the emotions of life. Sadly, this is the only element that it successfully accomplished, as most of it was more a dribble of clichés coupled by some poorly performed dunks. The acting was decent, perhaps a bit too accentuated for the surroundings, but it was the characters that just seemed oddly mismatched. I felt as if I was watching and trying to get excited for a High School Junior Varsity game, when I honestly should have been focusing on a stronger, more defined team. There was some meat to this film, but you had to eat around the gristle to get there, and that wasn't enjoyable in the least. Love & Basketball was fun to watch, but didn't quite create that spark that was needed to electrify the court.Let's begin with Spike Lee. Now, I don't like to name drop in these reviews, but I am a big fan of Lee's work. I believe his films are some of the most underrated films in Hollywood. He is hard hitting, in your face, and extremely rough, but for me it works. I have not been disappointed with any of his work. I am however, disappointed with his involvement in this film. With Lee involved as a producer, I was expecting a much grittier portrayal of this basketball love. I wanted to see a better-defined connection between the two themes, but instead what I was handed was a chaotic bowl of spaghetti, with moments interweaving with other, non-connective moments. It was devastating to watch. Needless to say, Lee should have put his chops more into this film. It could have been dark, it could have been honest, but instead we were left with a sea of fouls, bad dribbles, and tons of air balls.The acting could have been stronger.

I know, I know....books and films are two different art forms and little can be gained by comparing the telling of the same story in one vs. the other. I'm a firm advocate of that myself. However, let me just say that you cannot watch this film as a substitute of the Steinbeck novel (though a film should *never* be used as a stand in for literature in my opinion). Kazan et al. very liberally adapt Steinbeck's story to the big screen and make a very impressive film; however, it's not the same story Steinbeck himself was telling.That aside, East of Eden is a good (not quite great, but close) film from a very inconsistent period of American film making (i.e. the mid-50's.) Cinemascope and other widescreen processes were new, and many directors were content just to train their cameras on a pretty landscape and think that was enough to make their compositions interesting. However, Elia Kazan, completely at home in the stark b&w worlds of On the Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire obviously knew what to do with his widescreen compositions, and, as a result, East of Eden is far more dynamic than many films from the same time period. For example, in an early scene, Cal (James Dean) walks along a stand of trees beside his brother and his brother's soon-to-be fiancé. While they're talking, Cal walks deeper into the frame and follows the other two while hidden from us and them by the trees. This of course serves the purpose of communicating Cal's isolation, but it also seems like a perfectly natural thing for Cal's character to do and so doesn't feel obvious or heavy handed, and it's visually interesting, and so breaks up the frame. Kazan adds touches like that throughout the entire film. Even if they don't always work (the skewed angles toward the end are somewhat corny), they're appreciated for their attempts to create a unique visual style.James Dean just wasn't a very good actor, but he was an interesting screen presence. He was always sulking around and looking uncomfortable in his own skin, which is probably why teenagers at the time related to him so much, and why he seems so right for the role of Cal. The women in this film deliver the best performances. Julie Harris does much with a somewhat thankless role through her naturalistic acting, and Jo Van Fleet is simply terrific in a role that amounts to one significant scene. I'm not sure she deserved an Oscar for her (maybe) ten minutes of screen time, but she does manage to make Kate into a memorable character in the blink of an eye. Indeed, the film's greatest disservice to the novel is in reducing Kate's character to nothing more than a plot device. Anyone who's read the book remembers what a vivid character Steinbeck creates of her, and it's a shame the film couldn't take more advantage of that.What the movie comes down to thematically is an investigation into the good vs. bad impulses that exist in everyone, and whether or not we are forced into one of these two polar opposites by fate or have the ability to decide for ourselves which one we'll choose.

Go to Lost Images from Ambersons and you will see for the first time, some powerful stills from the lost segments.Based on this, plus Richard Carringer's book The Magnificent Ambersons-a Reconstruction, and what survives of the film, I think that maybe, just maybe, this could have been one of the greatest films of all time!But so many ifs persist, however 1. If only the Japanese hadn't attacked Pearl Harbor. 2. If only Wells had stayed to successfully complete the picture. 3.

The entire Mercury cast & crew simply went overboard in the telling of this quaint and simple Victorian story, and instead treated like it was the grandest tragedy of all time. Blame it on their inexperience with the medium. They had been lucky with their first film Citizen Kane. That film had plenty of artistic excesses, but the subject matter was more compelling, and held the audience interest throughout; this time they were not so lucky. Apparently, what seemed to them so wonderfully dramatic in front of the camera, simply did not translate to the viewer on the screen; again, because it is a different medium from that of stage or radio productions.I know that there are lot of fans of Wells & this film, and it's hard for them to admit fault. It's easier to blame RKO, the audience, or other circumstances; but the truth is that Orson, cast, & crew simply got carried away. There is plenty of evidence for this, mainly from Richard Carringer's book The Magnificent Amberson - a Reconstruction. The previews were terrible, the management staff at RKO agreed that the film was too downbeat & somber (they can't all be wrong, that's their business), and even Bernard Herrmann's score (wonderfully recreated by Preamble Records in 1990, I have a copy), reveals a different Herrmann dark, downbeat, excessively dramatic, & too somber (the exact words RKO general manager George Schafer used to describe it). Also, the thing that strikes me the most is the odd ending that Wells tacked on. The simple ending that Tarkington gave us was perfect; why mess with it? It confirms my impression that Wells interpretation was a darker, somber view (and too much so, perhaps). He simply didn't believe in happy endings, and the audience paid the price!Now whether the original version would hold up today, I guess we will never know. One only has to move ahead to 1944 and Jane Eyre to see the difference (with some of the same participants Orson, Agnes Moorehead, & Bernard Herrmann), when a director (Robert Stevenson) & crew (20th Century-Fox) knew how to strike a balance between art & entertainment.Want further evidence...? Move ahead to Well's later efforts The Stranger (1946), The Lady from Shanghai(1948), and especially Touch of Evil (1958) All were gimmicky, arty, dark and overly melodramatic (and commercial failures!).

What about this episode let's them know that it's more serious than any other falling out the two woman have had? Who knows. Maybe it's because Sidda's getting married, and the ya-ya's know that neither will really want the other to miss this important part of Sidda's life. Later, they are even more concerned when Sidda reveals that her past trauma is threatening her future happiness.What is the big secret that lets sidda's mother off the hook for years of abuse and alcoholism and abandonment is NOT the point of the movie. The point comes in Sidda's question- what if I turn out to be like her, a woman who beats her children and leaves? Another big clue is given when Sidda says, Me not lovin' mama was never the problem. (see- she loves her mom, despite many reviewers who may feel that this love or forgiveness is unfounded) Maggie Smith replies Her not loving you was never the problem either. That is the crux right there- now comes convincing Sidda of this truth. It's not forgiving her mother, but finally being able to stop blaming herself for the sudden change in her mother. The revelation, too subtle for many, is that Sidda didn't cause the change and Sidda herself won't suddenly become a monster when she is 'tied down' with marriage and children either.I fault the movie for not fully explaining how the med's that Vivi took were later found to cause psychotic episodes, a fact which no one knew at the time. And for not stressing this link, and the shame that Vivi felt at having been involuntarily committed (a line in the dialog that could have easily been missed by many viewers) that was so deep that she would let her children think instead that she had abandoned them.

It would have been more believable to have had the bus launched into orbit around the earth, or to the moon.

I think it's worth viewing for the overall creep factor but truthfully this movie pales in comparison to the Haunting which is a much better haunted house story. The acting in The Innocents is top-notch if a bit hammy. The ending is completely vague and is very unsatisfying. I wanted to see more of what happened. What happened to Flora? Why did Miles die? I don't object to vague endings per se, but this particular ending just felt like the director ran out of steam and said cut before a real ending could be captured. I know this movie has it's devoted following but I'm wondering if that following has seen the Haunting?

Despite both films feature bugs as the heroes and the villains, the films are too different to really be compared. A Bug's Life is my personal favourite of the two, but it's not by much. It is simply a little more engaging. However, Antz uses a clever concept and focuses more on the world of the ant. The film can be enjoyed by adults and children, and like A Bug's Life, it is educational and entertaining.Antz is a story of individualism, which is an unusual concept in the world of ants. In fact, it is a little bit like communism. Everyone works, but nothing brings out the individual. For the most part, all ants look and act the same... but our little ant clearly stands out. It is he who saves the day because of his individuality and his ability to think.Although there are some good ideas and good story-telling behind this film, overall, it fails to really see it through and make a big impact. A Bug's Life was more entertaining and quickly paced, and it doesn't possess the sappy love story like Antz does. A Bug's Life also succeeds a little more with the family, whereas a lot of the story in Antz is just dull. I would recommend this film to children, but I would not bother recommending it to adults.
