It drags itself through 95 slow, laugh-less, uneventful, fall-asleep-dull minutes with two simple focal points being Greek and getting married. Neither of which it addresses with any sense of originality. Nearly every line in the movie is about being Greek. Mind you, that doesn't bother me at all, I would prefer to see a movie exploring and playing with a culture you rarely get to see in movies. However, this movie drops the ball. Instead of showing us something different it wraps itself in lazy, elementary ethnic stereotypes - all in a parade of running gags that possibly even the Cohen brothers couldn't have squeezed a laugh out of. And like clockwork, you can just see people coming out to support it to say things like That's just how my family is and If you were Greek you'd get it. Ironically, none of that is true. The movie's themes, while specific in the details to it's culture, are universal. And the characters are so broadly drawn that anyone can relate to them and what they do. Aside from the father (a pretty good Michael Constantine) we never really get to know any member of the family beyond their functional role as a stereotype. And that goes for our main character as well Nia Vardalos' Toula. We never get what's motivating her, her boyfriend and insta-fiance (John Corbett) and their relationship. The movie fails as romantic comedy at every signpost. Toula narrates the film and comments on her quirky family's culture in a dull sardonic tone, to the point where when she mulls on how the Greek women are only supposed to get married, cook food and become baby making machines we can't quite tell if she is speaking as a young rebel poking fun at the old traditional ways or (based on the ending) if she is just bitter and jealous that she has yet to get married and pump out an army of babies. But Corbett is her even lamer half. Playing the romantic comedy's vision of the perfect man Corbett's Ian spends pretty much the entire film just standing there, blank faced, nodding and going along with whatever Toula and her family  require him to do. With Ian being a non-Greek you would think there are ripe spots here for some culture-clash comedy. However, we don't get so much as a funny befuddled reactionary shot out of Corbett. Ian has no personality. He's just generic Mr. Handsome and, in a leap in logic to big even in a fairy tale like this, it is still him that tries to win her over. She does nothing but sit at a desk while he walks by out the window and notices. That's our big, fat, lame 'meeting cute' scene. However, the single lamest bit in the script is the opening few minutes where we see Toula looking like an old maid - matted hair, horn-rimmed glasses, big frumpy clothes. This is the insultingly stupid script-writing-seminar way of instantly explaining to us why Toula is 30 years old and still single (it is archaic for the movie to think we need an explanation in the first place). When she suddenly, out of the blue, decides to fix herself up like the geek-tuned-babe in a teen movie she instantly meets the dream guy. It is the dumbed down way this movie lays everything out for it's audience that is more offensive than any ethnic stereotype. I hate to pick on Vardalos. I'm even going to ignore the fact that she can't act. It's her first script and it's a tribute to her that she got her movie produced in the first place. It was a little movie never meant to be such a hit. And it was such a hit, I'm pretty sure, because it just happened to be the independent movie of the moment. Every year at the end of summer, after all the summer blockbusters are played out, that audiences latch onto some little independent film like this as if to make a statement that they are tired of big, hollow, Hollywood action flicks and just want to see some cute little storytelling. This always gets a lot of press as if it's a coming trend and the cycle repeats itself every year. All of this regardless of how bad the movie is. 'The Blair Witch Project' was one such movie. The complete, abysmal disaster of this movie is shared between Vardalos' script which doesn't give anyone a lot to work with and director Joel Zwick. Vardalos sets up a few gags with possibilities and an incredibly talented director like the Cohen brothers might have found a way to make it work. Zwick is a veteran sitcom director so that explains the junk, shoddy look of the movie. His camera work is dark and static. The comedy is cartoonish but not up to the point of zany satire. This one is for housewives who will eat up any movie about marriage and don't demand alot out of a romantic comedy. Everyone else will likely be bored to tears. Alternate Viewing Recommendation Kissing Jessica Stein. Anyone that saw this edgy, smart, forward-thinking romantic comedy will find MBFGW rudimentary by comparison.

He needs to be cheered up so Trent (Vince Vaughn) takes him to Vegas. They hook up with some waitresses, Trent gets what he wanted from one of them and Mike keeps talking about his lost girlfriend to the other one. After Vegas we follow Mike, Trent and others like Rob (Ron Livingston) and Sue (Patrick Van Horn). They go to coffee shops and talk about nothing, they visit parties where they try to hook up with girls.The movie starts with one uncomfortable scene after another involving Mike.

One soldier from each side of the battle was trapped between the front lines of the two rivals. They cannot leave the trench because if they do, the army will fire and kill them. To make things worse, there was a third soldier who was placed on a landmine, which would explode when the pressure on the landmine is released (i.e. when he gets up from a lying down position).This is such a sad story with plenty of extremely touching scenes. It provokes people to think that there are so many ridiculous things that people do to each other during wars. People think that by killing each other the problem can be solved. This is a highly upsetting idea. It also revealed the terrible bureaucracy of some organisations, which gives little regard for human life.Although it portrayed that the two rival soldiers had a lot of anger and distrust between them, there are times that it showed that they are also human. The two of them talked and found out that there was a girl that they both knew. I think that they were living in the same country, and they were just like any other civilians, just like you and me. They could have been living the same type of life, and suddenly friends became enemies.In this film there were no large scale battle scenes like in `Saving Private Ryan' or `Gallipoli'. However, this film is just as sad and emotionally provoking like any other outstanding anti-war movie. It tells people the absurdity of war, and how crazy people can be during war. I was very shocked to know that the soldiers in Yugoslavia really put landmines beneath bodies, so that when the bodies are cleared away, the landmine would explode and kill the dead man's friends and relatives. This behaviour is extremely sickening. The inventor of such landmines is also very disgusting. I wonder, how can people create such a sophisticated device, and use it in such a ruthless way to kill? I have always thought that, if these people who invent killing machines go to invent some other machines instead, maybe we would be living in the `future world' portrayed in the film already. Our technology would be more advanced than it is now.However, nowadays the weapons are getting more complicated, advanced, deadly and destructive every day. It saddens me a lot, because I never understood why a war has to start. The most ironic thing is that, the man who decides to wage a war against another country is always unharmed, because he sits in his office and has a large team of army to protect him. He does not die in the war. But because of his decision, millions of young men have to die.Though there is such a grave message behind this film, there is also a lighter side to it. There were a lot of scenes which are funny, and all the viewers laughed and clapped for the witty statements. For example, when the two soldiers were trapped in the trench, they were discussing which side did more war crimes. The soldier who got the gun won the argument, and the possession of the gun changed a few times. There was another scene which a soldier searched the pockets of a soldier whom he just killed, and found a picture of a naked man.Another scene which everyone laughed was that, a soldier asked the soldier lying on the landmine if he was OK. The poor soldier replied 'Of course I am OK, I got shot, and then I was unconscious, and then woke up and found there is a landmine beneath me, and then the whole world is watching me, and then I want to go to toilet, and now I was greeted by rubbish statements from my friend'.I hope this film would make people understand that wars are completely vile and barbaric, and no one would start a war again.

Well, because basically Ferris makes his living by lying, scamming, and taking advantage of others.  Now, given the character of some of our recently-retired political leaders, while that might qualify one to hold high office, I'm not sure its a good character trait for ordinary folks.That said, this isn't a bad movie.  It's a kind of blend of high school hijinks and teenage angst, the former supplied by Ferris and the latter by his friend Cameron.

Deservedly becoming the biggest film of all time in 1993 and launching the most entertaining film series ever made, Spielberg's film contains all the cliches a blockbuster should have and ensures that it remains good fun. We have the courageous scientist in the shape of Sam Niell, his fiesty girlfriend courtesy of Laura Dern, a doom and gloom expert in the causes of the problem at hand thanks to a brilliant performance from Bob Peck and the quirky scientist type who prophesises doom from the get go in the shape of Jeff Goldblum. This is fun and has remained so for the last ten years.Where the film has remained so good over the past decade is in its use of CGI and at the time state of the art special effects. They still haven't dated and look fluidly real as if the technology had only been made yesterday. Undoubtedly the dinosaurs are the star here (none of the actors have headlined each film with a change of performer for each one, Goldblum in the second installment, Niell returning for number three), but it doesn't matter because the dinosaurs here are truly movie stars in their own right and like characters in an ensemble film they all get their moments. The T-Rex gets to cause spectacular destruction, the Raptors get to be the vicious and conniving villains of the story, the Brachiosaurus ensures it grabs our awe while the Tricerotops gains our sympathy.However, Spielberg ensures that it isn't just the dinosaurs who are the stars here. He creates tension in the way that only he can with prolonged set pieces such as the T-Rex attack and the moment Alan and Tim have to race down a tree with the threat of a car falling on top of them. Sure it ain't art, it's great entertainment and it is great fun and it here where Spielberg ensures the film classic status. He uses the two hour frame to set up events and the story in the first hour and then let the chaos rip in the second with suspenseful action sequence after suspenseful action sequence and it works. While you may not look to performances in a film like this, it does have some fantastic actors. Niell seems surprisingly well suited to being a Spielbergian hero who starts of disliking children only to have his heart melted at the end. He appears to be having great fun playing the guy who saves the day. Jeff Goldblum almost runs away with the entire film as Malcolm, the quirky off beat nature of the character ensuring many a great one liner while Richard Attenborough is heart breaking as the Walt Disney like John Hammond whose dream becomes a violent nightmare.The film is great fun from beginning to end and deserves to be up there with Jaws and King Kong as one of the all time great monster movies.

The man ultimately finds himself in some sort of conspiracy but his world is twisted and twilight zone like. When hes unable to trust even his own memory he questions his own reality...and the story just goes down the rabbit hole.

Diva is not such a film, it has so much plot that I don't know where to begin. Maybe I'll begin with the two tapes the film is all about.  Tape one is the bootleg record of the beautiful aria Ebben ne andro lontana from Alfredo Catalani's opera La Wally, taped during the recital of the famous opera singer Cynthia Hawkins. On tape, two Nadja, a prostitute, discloses who is the man behind a prostitution ring.  The man who possesses these two tapes is Jules, a postman; tape one because he's the one who recorded it (for private use only, of course), tape two because Nadja slipped it into his bag just seconds before she's killed. Not really knowing why, Jules finds himself fleeing from the police and from the mob because of the latter tape - and since Cynthia Hawkins always refused to make tape recordings of her voice, two guys from the Taiwanese mafia, who sat just behind Jules when he recorded his bootleg, see their chance to make a fortune with it, try to get it and blackmail the diva.Meanwhile, Jule becomes friends with Cynthia Hawkins when he brings her back a dress he stole after her recital (but not after having sex with a hooker wearing it) and they spend a day together. He also encounters Alba, a nice, glib girl with a talent for shoplifting (she developed a technique that makes you wish you're the guy behind the counter) and Gorodish, the man she lives with, two people who will help him a lot in the course of the film. All this is handled by director Jean-Jacques Beineix with virtuosity. But I'm only talking about the twisted plot here, whereas Diva is so much more.It is its pop-art style, it is its unique genre-mix of Thriller and Romance, it is Jules' apartment, which looks like combination of a studio and a garage, it is its two killers who look like they escaped a Jeunet-film (and indeed Dominique Pinon, who plays one of the two killers, went on to star in Delicatessen, La cité des enfants perdus and Amélie), it is that wonderful chase scene where Jules drives down the stairs and takes the Métro with his moped, it is that absurdly funny scene with the blue Beethoven bust, it is Thuy An Luu, playing Alba as a cheerful girl that makes you wish you had a girlfriend like that, it is Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez, a real-life opera singer in her only film role, playing a wonderful Cynthia Hawkins (how I love that look she gives when someone reminds her of her age), it is Gorodish ingeniously solving two problems at once, it is its wonderful ending I will not reveal her with the perfect last words (Shhhh, listen...)... I could go on with this list forever.  With its hilarious story, its beautiful images, its weird characters and its joyous direction, Diva could open the door to the cinema of the rest of the world for those whose Top 10 list consist only of films as Pulp Fiction, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, The Usual Suspects or The Godfather.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"11 June 2003","score":"","review":"  It's always nice when a film tells a good story.  Even if it's full of flaws.  I smiled a lot during the early moments of THE DANGEROUS LIFE OF ALTER BOYS.  I reminisced about by own childhood.  I felt deep sympathy when the characters wanted to cry.  Oh yeah and Jenna Malone has proved she can play more layered roles.  This is a great movie.Set in small town America; in a time before video game saturation and before the Internet was a gleam in Al Gore's mind.  Boys and girls did what they could to elevate boredom. They played outside.  Emile Hirsch (The Emperor's Club) plays Francis Doyle, an alter boy with that typical teenage angst.  Kieran Culkin (Igby Goes Down) plays his best friend Tim Sullivan, he's the brain in the friendship, at least he's the guy who comes up with all the crazy schemes.  There are two other friends Wade (Jake Richardson, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) and Joey (Tyler Long, Forrest Gump).  Together these 4 boys create a comic book world into which they can escape.Jenna Malone (Stepmon) plays Margie Flynn, the innocent girl with the dark secret.  Francis longs to date her, and she's going to let him.  Let the coming of age movie begin.Francis and his friends have one problem Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster, Panic Room).  She's their teacher and probably the meanest nun to ever be on film.  She cuts them no slack, humiliates them during class prayer.  She's the perfect villain, for small town kids with out many real problems.THE DANGEROUS LIFE OF ALTER BOYS strikes the right cords at the right moment.  This film hits me like THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, it's not the same story, but Francis is just as strong a central character.  I have a feeling that the real Sister Assupmta, isn't half as mean as Francis think she is.Kieran Culkin's performance hits the right tones too.  He's the mischief-maker and the ringleader, and you know why?  He's charismatic and funny at the right moments.  If I was that age I would have thought the cougar idea was a good one too.  Would I have followed them to the cage? Hmm&#133;I don't know!Jenna Malone, one word--WOW!  The camera loves her, and her performance is so sweet.  I think I hung out with girls just like Margie when I was in high school.  She steals small moments in this film, and you just want to give her a big hug near the end. Did I mention the animation?  The film has some of the most inventive comic book style animation I've ever seen.  It's a nice device to move the story forward; any lesser movie would probably wallow in trashy voice-over.  Thankfully this film does not. If you're looking for a film, that's sweet but not sweet enough to give you a cavity.  If you're looking for a film with just the right beats, even with some faults.  THE DANGEROUS LIFE OF ALTERBOYS just might be your penance. ","genre":null},{"date":"11 June 2003","score":"","review":"  It's always nice when a film tells a good story.

The running time is like 1 hour 20 minutes or something and i think if the story was able to develop more it would be really, really good. Everything happens too quickly or not in enough depth so it's just kind of weak, but as i say, it's not terrible, you just have to accept that it's way to short for a film of this kind.Maura Tierney is once again great though. She's very convincing as the character Madeleine, but again, if it were more in depth she'd be brilliant. Adrien Brody is excellent and you just want to hit him as the character, Harry.Overall, i'd recommend it if you like the actors, but if you want a really scary, true to life crime thriller then give it a miss.

Pi was great, but this movie takes the theories and techniques that he used in that movie and sends them into outer space. The performances are breath taking. Everybody sinks their teeth into the role they play, to the point where it feels more like a home movie than a scripted effort. Ellen Burstyn is incredible. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are also superb as the teen junkies, but the biggest surprise for me was Marlon Wayans (he can actually act!).The movie is dived into three acts Summer, Fall and Winter. Summer is morbidly depressing, so you can probably guess that Fall and Winter are positively gut-wrenching. Suffice to say that this is not a feel good movie by any means.
