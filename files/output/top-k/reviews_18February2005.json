The cast is a good choice even if many have little regard for Keanu Reeve's acting ability it works well here and I could not imagine anyone else better suited for the role of Morpheus than Lawrence Fishbourne.

To look at the actual script you would not regard the part as malevolent but Mr Weaving turns it into the guy you really love to hate! This has similar shades to Ricardo Montalban's Khan in Star Trek 2 where some of the line looks mundane of even laughable but are made into something completely unexpected by the actor portraying the character.

This was when Neo recovers after being killed and realises he is 'the one'.Final word - If you never seen the film then at least go out and rent it to decide if you love or loathe it.

I should agree with them, the one reason I don't is that you can clearly see this film attempted to be great in all areas. I feel sorry for them, they carried the story well and related back to a lot from the original stories. They would have succeeded if it weren't for the fact that they made a couple of casting errors. The lead hero and villain were good, Tim Curry always boosts a film and the female wasn't that bad really. The rest should have been reconsidered, however. Sir Ian McKellen is capable of so much more than he delivered, which is surprising. Even so, he should not have been chosen for that role. The one problem this film really has is that it chose to use a character created in times when there weren't any heroes really. It is nearly impossible to understand these times and therefore the impact of the character was lost on the audience this time around. It is a real shame, because the shot of The Shadow at the top of the stairs in the hotel is one of the best you will find of any hero in film. If you are aware of the original Shadow articles, this film will probably already be in your collection. It does a great job and should not have flopped to the extent it did.

I also love a good laugh and a good satire of detective films is sure to catch my attention. I still remember going to the theater to see this movie and I was quite excited about it. The cast alone makes it is a worthwhile viewing area. For me, other standouts were Peter Falk as a Sam Spade type character with Eileen Brennan as his girl Friday, and Peter Sellers as Mr. Wang, a short of combination of all three of the great Oriental detectives in detective film history. (For all of you that at keeping score, those who would be Mr. Wong, Mr. Moto and the new rule Charlie Chan.)It is amazing that Estelle Winwood at age 100 was alive to do this movie. In fact, I still remember the original trailer with narration by comic giant Mel Brooks saying, Is she still breathing?Much has been made of the deletion of the Sherlock Holmes scene but what is even more interesting is the reason for the deletion. Apparently, at least some of the actors felt that they would be overshadowed by the appearance of them the world's greatest detective, and so it was cut from the final print. Fortunately for me, when the film was playing simultaneously that month on cable and broadcast TV, I had taped both versions and marked where the scene would have been and stopped the taping of one of the cable viewings, then dubbed in the Holmes scene and later taped the rest of the cable version after it. Now that I find that the DVD copy has not restored the scene, I will hold off on buying the DVD.But back to the film. For a guy who grew up on Mad Magazine, I almost knew where every punchline would be, yet I still enjoy it. Without giving any spoilers, I will say that the ending was a bit unsatisfying. There seems to be a trend in some comedies (not to mention some Saturday Night Live skits) to have a great premise and not know how to end it so they peter out at the end and some sort of hastily constructed ending is tacked on. Still, there are so many great moments in this movie and the cast makes the ride a fun one.The plot is really unimportant here. Basically, a bunch of detectives are called to a rich man's home to solve a murder. Considering that Neil Simon wrote this on a weekend, the non ending is somewhat forgivable. But then again, Neil Simon is a professional writer with some standing even when this film was new. Yet, to be too hard on this film is a futile exercise. Who committed the crime and why makes no difference. Just laugh and have yourself a good time.

A sprawling role-playing game with a fantastic story told out in glorious 3D detail the likes of which had never been seen before (and now prop up every RPG released since). The only possible criticism one could have was that it went all for too long and if it's the seventh game in the series, it's not exactly very final. When news reached me of a Final Fantasy movie, I had high hopes despite video game-movie cross-overs being famously difficult to pull off. Imagine my disappointment on discovering that Final Fantasy The Spirits Within would only be set within the Final Fantasy universe and have nothing to do with one of my favourite games. And yes, no Tifa either.Instead, we have Dr Aki Ross (voiced by Ming-Na) and Dr Sid (Donald Sutherland) roaming the Earth looking for seven spirits which will help them in the fight against the invading alien forces. These invisible beasties pretty much own the planet so any help is better than nothing. Not everyone thinks that Dr Sid's spirits are the answer, especially megalomaniac general Hein (James Woods) and his nasty space-weapon Zeus. Ross and Sid race against time to find the last remaining spirits together with a bunch of sympathetic soldiers led by Ross's one-time boyfriend Gray Edwards (Alec Baldwin) before humanity is completely destroyed.Despite not being able to see a Chocobo in sight (though they are in somewhere, apparently), this is typical Final Fantasy. Basically, lots of apocalyptic special effects and powerful weapons that defy logic. Yep, if you loved all those Materia that summoned people like Satan to kill those mutant plants then you'll love this. This is so over-the-top that in the end, you get bored of it all. The ending actually reminded me of Kubrick's 2001 A Space Oddessy in that it dazzles you with visuals and explains nothing. Trouble here is that this film dazzles you with visuals from the get-go. This is, without question, the best animated film of all time. People look like people instead of computer sprites - Aki's hair in full flow is so lifelike that it hurts your head to think about it. But while the quality of animation will continue to set standards for years to come, it still isn't as entertaining as something like The Incredibles. And the fact that the story is a stand-alone instead of a recognisable game follow-up also hurts the picture.As a technical accomplishment, Final Fantasy The Spirits Within is a winner. With great vocal performances from all the actors, this really is one of the best animated productions I think I'll ever see. But as a piece of entertainment, it can't cut the mustard. The story feels muddled and the film has a downbeat nature, betraying its cutesy video game origins. The other problem I had is similar to the one I had in Spiderman 2 - because you know the action is animated, the thrill you're supposed to get rarely comes and when it does, it doesn't last. It's such a shame that despite the impressive high-tech display, there is only a average movie beneath the surface. The film didn't deserve to be a commercial flop - all that effort had to be repaid somehow - but film goers can be a harsh crowd sometimes. Give it a chance and it might surprise you.

I really, really like this movie a lot and have liked it from the first time I saw it. What I really admire about this film is it's cast, who knew that it was probably going to be John Wayne's last film. They brought out the best for this film.Let's look at the director, Don Siegel, a really top notch director of action films that are more than action films, like Dirty Harry and Escape from Alcatraz. Mr. Siegel seems to really have the talent to blend a story with action.Let's look at the leads. John Wayne - what can you say the man always will be known as an icon. A true professional - he had little patience with actors who did not show up on time and did not know their lines. Look at the standing ovation he got for his Best Actor Oscar for True Grit. Hollywood loved this guy! Lauren Bacall - awesome, as always. She always delivers in any part. She's such a reliable, remarkable actress. She's a direct link to another era of Hollywood, when stars weren't jockeying for position at the Sundance Film Festival or showing up in Us Magazine. Bacall shows up prepared for a role and she gets the job done. And done well. Lauren, you're a great actress and great in this film! Bogie would be proud. Ron Howard - good to see him leave the comfort zone of Happy Days and play a really great character with many facets to his character. You can see the real admiration and respect he has not only for Wayne but for the other actors.And then there's the rest. I mean, come on - where are you going to find a film like this in the '70s with so many really good actors. Not Charo, John Davidson, Jimmie Walker - people trying to survive a disaster - this is a real movie with an awesome story. Jimmy Stewart, Harry Morgan, Sheree North, John Carradine, Richard Boone - awesome! Awesome! What's really touching about this film is that you know that major, major actors took smaller roles in order to be in a movie with Duke Wayne. Amazing. Enjoy the movie, it's great!

What I really admire about this film is it's cast, who knew that it was probably going to be John Wayne's last film. They brought out the best for this film.Let's look at the director, Don Siegel, a really top notch director of action films that are more than action films, like Dirty Harry and Escape from Alcatraz. Mr. Siegel seems to really have the talent to blend a story with action.Let's look at the leads. John Wayne - what can you say the man always will be known as an icon. A true professional - he had little patience with actors who did not show up on time and did not know their lines. Look at the standing ovation he got for his Best Actor Oscar for True Grit. Hollywood loved this guy! Lauren Bacall - awesome, as always. She always delivers in any part. She's such a reliable, remarkable actress. She's a direct link to another era of Hollywood, when stars weren't jockeying for position at the Sundance Film Festival or showing up in Us Magazine. Bacall shows up prepared for a role and she gets the job done. And done well. Lauren, you're a great actress and great in this film! Bogie would be proud. Ron Howard - good to see him leave the comfort zone of Happy Days and play a really great character with many facets to his character. You can see the real admiration and respect he has not only for Wayne but for the other actors.And then there's the rest. I mean, come on - where are you going to find a film like this in the '70s with so many really good actors. Not Charo, John Davidson, Jimmie Walker - people trying to survive a disaster - this is a real movie with an awesome story. Jimmy Stewart, Harry Morgan, Sheree North, John Carradine, Richard Boone - awesome! Awesome! What's really touching about this film is that you know that major, major actors took smaller roles in order to be in a movie with Duke Wayne. Amazing. Enjoy the movie, it's great!

Hitchcock filmed this story, about two well-to-do rich kids who decide to commit a murder for the fun of it, as a play. Which, it in fact, originally was, though based in London and not New York. Technical limitations did not enable his original vision of making the entire picture one continuous long shot. Instead it is made up of several 8 minute continuous shots. This was the length of film that fit into one reel. Using some very inventive cutting techniques the film appears as if it was filmed all in one take. This is more impressive when you see the actual size that color film cameras were during this time period. They were absolutely enormous, bigger than a man standing. To move the camera in and around the small stage space, many of the set pieces were set on casters and rolled about to keep out of the way of the camera. Some of the actors were noted in saying that they worried every time they sat down, that there might not be a chair for them to fall into. Another achievement of the film is in terms of lighting. The apartment that the entire film is set in has several large windows overlooking the city. As the movie is more or less uninterrupted from start to finish we see the lighting change as the sun begins to set and night falls. It is a testament to this achievement that upon first viewing you don't really notice the effect. Yet, the filmmakers took great pains to get it to look realistic, staging numerous re-shoots for the final few scenes.Though the technical achievements are quite wonderful, it is a shame that they have overshadowed what it really a very good bit of suspense. It seems the two high society murderers have planned a dinner party just after the murder. They store the corpse in a wood box that is featured prominently in the midst of the dinner. This creates an excellent mix of suspense and the macabre. Throughout the party the murderers become more unraveled even as they are enjoying their little game.All of the acting is quite good. The two murderer (John Dall and Farley Granger) do a fine job of playing intellectual, society playboys, with a desire for excitement. It is slightly annoying watching their excited, nervous mannerisms (especially some stuttering by Jon Dall) but it is fitting with the characters. Their former instructor, Rupert Cadell, is played magnificently by the impeccable James Stewart. This is a bit of departure from Stewarts typical roles. Here he is a tough, cynical intellectual. This was his first of four collaborations between Stewart and Hitchock and it is hard to imagine his role as Scottie in Vertigo without having first played in this movie.The story unravels in typical Hitchock fashion. The suspense is built, then lessoned by some well timed comedy, and then built again to a final crescendo. Hitchcock was excellent as a technical director and allowed his actors the breathing room they needed for fine performances. In the end I left the picture feeling more excited about the superb storytelling than any particular technical achievement. It is a testament to his craft, that Hitchock allows you to leave a picture being enamored with his story over his technical achievements. Some of the greatest effects are those you don't notice because they seem so natural and real.Alfred Hitchock manages a triumph of technical brilliance and suspense in Rope. It's influence in the technical realm of cinema far outshines any effect the story has on future movies. This is a shame, for the story being told is one of suspense, macabre and excitement.Like this review? Go to www.midnitcafe.blogspot for more.

It's only after repeated viewings and the realisation of what it actually was that Tarkovsky tried to achieve that it dawns that this is more than just a bunch of random scenes, but a timeless and highly important masterpiece which defies explanation. But I'll try anyway.I personally hold Tarkovsky in very high esteem. There are many directors I would regard as good or very good (for instance Kubrick, Kieslowski, Ozu, or Miyazaki), but there are only two directors I regard as absolute geniuses Akira Kurosawa and, yep, Andrei Tarkovsky. Interestingly this is for two solely different reasons - whereas I admire Kurosawa for the manner in which he managed to perfect the art of cinematic storytelling, Tarkovsky deserves praise for wanting to shake cinema out of its complacent acceptance that films should simply tell a story and little else. Mirror is further proof that Tarkovsky's body of work (which is limited in quantity - a mere eight films - but rich in scope) establishes that the Hollywood mode of narrative is not the only way in which film can create an emotional response from an audience. Of course Tarkovsky is not alone in having done so (Marker and Greenaway immediately spring to mind), but what distinguishes him from other art house directors is that he has managed to take this style of film making and drive it to a stage that can be described as almost perfect.I personally interpret Mirror as a man's life flashing before his eyes before he dies; his relationship with his wife and mother (both played by the same person, in an ingenious move on Tarkovsky's behalf), his children, his friends, the history of his home land, his own childhood. However, Mirror is deliberately structured in such a way that it can, and will, be interpreted differently by different people depending on how they inscribe their own personal thoughts and feelings into the narrative. This is where Tarkovsky's genius comes to fore - to create a film which does not dictate to an audience how to feel by manipulating them via music or mise-en-scene, but to make it the other way around. In the case of Mirror, we, the audience, dictate the emotional response created by the images on screen and, that, ultimately is that makes it such a wonderful work and a true rarity. This is possibly another way the title of the film can be interpreted, in that it illustrates a wholly reflective style of cinema.Those not accustomed to a slightly more disjunctive cinematic style are likely to dismiss Mirror as boring or dull because it may not necessarily correspond to their expectations of film. However, it is still something I would regard as required viewing for everyone since it shows that cinema can be beautiful without necessarily following the rules Hollywood has imposed on the rest of the film making community, and that ultimately rules are there to be broken.

A story about a seaside town attacked by a shark would not seem to be the basis for one of the most loved, respected and successful movies of all time, but Spielberg and the cast make it happen-scares excitement, laughs, good characters and great acting all contribute, along with fluid direction and a now infamous score. The budget was low, the filming at sea extremely troublesome, the shark wouldn't do what it was supposed to, but through all this the story prevails and we are left with a true classic.Scheider stars as Sheriff Brody, an ex-city cop with a fear of water who moves with his family to Amity, a popular sea-side holiday resort. There have been a number of deaths recently, and young shark expert Hooper comes to town to long at the bodies. He believes the deaths have been caused by a Great White Shark which will not leave the are while there is still plenty of food around. He advises Brody to close the beach, but the Mayor thinks it should be kept open for the July 4th weekend, the time when the town makes a real profit. When attacks continue, Brody and Hooper decide to track the shark and catch it. Local fisherman Quint who has met one or two sharks in his time also comes. The three set out on the tiny boat, and the shark soon finds them.There are scenes which have since become the stuff of legends- the opening night attack, the 'need a bigger boat' scene and others.

While you may not end up where you expected to, you are ultimately glad you went along for the ride.It's 1959, and at Weldon Academy, tradition is everything. Weldon, however, is about to be shaken up by the arrival of John Keating (Robin Williams in an unusual dramatic turn), who encourages his students to look at things with new eyes. Among those who take his message most to heart are Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), son of an overbearing and unpleasant father (the truly evil Kurtwood Smith), and his roommate, Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), ignored younger brother of a previous Weldon valedictorian. While the students who form the Dead Poets Society have good intentions, participation in the group leads to Neil's defiance of his father, which in turn leads to tragedy. Todd has mostly been an observer throughout this, but the loss of one of the few people who cared about him, and the potential loss of another finally bring him out of his shell, and allow him to take his first stand.This is an interesting script, in that it leads you to believe you're going to have a happy ending, and then snatches that ending away so quickly you hardly know what has happened. Before you can catch your breath, a suicide has occurred, the surviving parents are hounding the school, teachers and students are turning against each other, and the truth is buried under expediency, leaving the viewer wondering what was being taught in prep schools in the 1950's. In the end, Keating is used as a scapegoat to appease the anguished father, but the film leaves one more lesson to be taught before Keating leaves Weldon forever. Unfortunately, several plot points introduced prior to the suicide are simply dropped after it, leaving the viewer wondering what happened to the budding romance of one of the students and a town girl, as well as a few other things that just get left rather than addressed.The setting of the prep school works rather well in this film, making it almost a world unto itself. The stone buildings represent the unchanging tradition valued so highly at Weldon. Nothing moves the stone; nothing changes the school. This further emphasizes the gulf between the students and the rest of the world on the occasions in which they enter it.In spite of the flaws in the script, the performances are uniformly strong. Smith is the epitome of evil, oozing malice out of every pore in every scene he is in. Unfortunately, this works against him when he loses his son, in that we feel no sympathy for him at all. Williams gives a surprisingly restrained performance as Keating. What comedy there is in this film does not come from him. He plays Keating as a man of passion and integrity, who accepts his fate with grace and class. While Leonard can be a bit cloying, he does an excellent job of portraying Neil, especially the vulnerability which is behind the bravado. The most remarkable performance in the film Hawke's Todd. Not only do you see wonderful character development, but some of Hawke's most expressive acting occurs when he has no dialogue at all. It is through Todd's eyes that we see the end of the film - his upset that one of the Dead Poets Society has turned traitor and gotten another expelled, his disbelief that the others have joined in the persecution of Keating, and his inability to take a stand against that injustice. Most impressive is the scene where Todd watches Keating pack to leave the school, rather than pay attention to class. Todd has no dialogue throughout, yet Hawke's portrayal is so skillful that you see everything he is feeling, and the buildup to his outburst. A truly unforgettable scene.This is a movie with an unhappy, yet satisfying ending. An injustice has been committed, but it has also been recognized, and perhaps a lesson learned.

The characters become like old acquaintances, some friendly, some funny, some hateful, but all of them interesting.In no time at all, you are drawn into the world of the street and the theater, and all of the characters are introduced in such a way that you immediately know a great deal about them. The six main characters (Garance and her four admirers, plus Nathalie) are admirably conceived, and they also form a nicely varied set of personalities. Their loves, their schemes, and their lives become vivid and memorable, and it's almost as if you were a part of their circle. Arletty and the rest of the cast are all quite good, and many of the minor characters also become interesting and effective parts of the story.Not only are the settings nicely detailed and well-matched with the story, but the story itself avoids the conventional expectations of romances or similar stories, to show things in a believable and thoughtful way. While wholly sympathetic to almost all of the characters, neither does it do them any special favors just to conform with Hollywoodish conventions. They are thus not only believable, but easy to identify with.The story-line also has one feature that works out extremely well, in that it allows a gap of several years in the middle of the plot. It makes the characters that much more interesting when they re-appear, some changed and some exactly the same, and it sparks new interest in the old situations when they re-arise.Beyond all that, there are many worthwhile themes to consider.

Wayne must try to win pack his friend and girlfriend, while trying to secure his show.There are many movie in-jokes here, many music references and sight gags, most of which i find funny, but many others will not. The dialogue has since become cheesy, but that was always the desired effect, and the two lead performances are very good. Garth will have you laughing just by looking at him, while Myers is clearly a smart comedian. The rest of the cast are good, Lowe moving away from his Brat pack days, and Carrera gives a better performance than many would expect. The smaller characters provide many laughs, ('why do they come to me to die?') and we will be rooting for Wayne as the film approaches its conclusions. Better than any of the Austin Powers films, though less successful, Wayne's World is simply a funny, light-hearted film which tries to give you the belief that you can overcome any obstacle and still get the girl.9 out of 10 ","genre":"Comedy, Music"},{"date":"18 February 2005","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" It's very disappointing that Anthony Perkins was type-casted due to this performance.

One of the best scenes in the movie is the dinner with Bates and Marion. It's a really well-developed sequence. And it shows Bates from both sides of the spectrum. A lonesome nice guy with a bit of sadness, then out pops a slight hint of perhaps madness or insanity.Watching this movie over and over, it still doesn't get boring to me. The build-up of Leigh's character being washed from existence doesn't become boring to me after multiple viewings. It's a Hitchcock movie. His style of filming leaves so much beauty to look at before the horror begins here. I found myself wandering all over the sets while re-watching this. And I think the first 45 minutes gives you a perfect introduction to Marion. At first you think she is going to get away with her spir of the moment crime, then you learn that the good in her knows what she did was wrong, and that she wants to go back and make the best she can of her mistake. Sadly, she never gets to, and one of the most iconic death scenes in horror history is born.

Being a huge fan of Leone's westerns, I naively thought that his talents were restricted to that genre. But after reviewing the cast, which includes Robert DeNiro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Treat Williams, and Jennifer Connelly in her first film role, I just had to check it out. I am very glad that I did. I was missing out on one of the most ambitious, engaging, and epic of all crime drama\/gangster films. This was Leone's final film before his death in 1989, but what a film to end an illustrious film career with. Maybe not as well known as other Leone classics such as A Fist Full of Dollars, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly or Once Upon A Time in the West but none the less a film that deserves to be put on the same level as those others, and also enjoy a small niche in the Leone library all it's own.The film stars DeNiro as Noodles (David Aaronson) a Jewish gangster and thug who has returned home after being run out 30 years earlier. He has come back at the request of an unknown person, a person who seems to know all about his past. Very few of his friends from the old days are still around, so with his curiosity peaked Noodles cautiously returns home. In the 30 years that Noodles has been gone, he has been haunted by the old days, by the choices he made, and by that one phone call he made that changed everything. He can still hear the ringing in his head. He feels guilty that he made that call that cost him so much, but as he finds out later, it was not his choice. He was being manipulated by someone very close and it was him that forced Noodles hand. He will also find out that his life ended up the way it did, because his dreams were forcibly taken from him, without his knowledge, by someone who perpetrated the ultimate betrayal.Once Upon A Time in America is an epic film that is thoroughly engaging from start to end. We Follow Noodles from his beginnings as a small time hood, to a big time prohibition era gangster, to a tired and hurt old man. This film is sort of like a journey, you just have to let go and allow yourself to go where Leone takes you. The sets and costumes give the film a truly authentic feel. The non-linear way the story is told works, and is very effective for telling this sort of complicated story. The music is excellent, another great score from frequent Leone collaborator Ennio Morricone. However the decision to use the Beatles tune Yesterday is understandable considering it's placement in the film, however hearing a pop song in a Leone movie was a little unsettling. But totally forgiven, being that is one of the very few flaws in an otherwise great film.Highly recommended to all fans of crime dramas, gangster films, westerns, or of just good movies in general.

And as far as Gwen Paltrow's accent is concerned, I must confess I wasn't too familiar with her when I saw this at the theater initially, and I was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an English actress!I am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery. That is one of the things I enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the English countryside. The film's beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success. If your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker, then perhaps you should rent something like Death Wish III!The English country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast, and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings. McGrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story.This refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex, violence or even a villainous antagonist.

The two go together like strawberries and cream, like white wine and fish. One is a glove, the other is a hand that fits perfectly inside. The Lee\/Cushing partnership made many movies together during the '50s, '60s and '70s, including some of the finest Hammer horror movies. Of their three decades as screen partners, their work from the 1970s is probably their weakest - Nothing But The Night, Dracula AD 1972, and The Satanic Rites Of Dracula are inferior examples of their films together. However, even in he '70s low period they still served up the occasional gem. The Creeping Flesh was a nicely done horror flick with a wickedly unexpected twist ending, and this - known in America and Britain as Horror Express - is a powerful and inventive bloodcurdler with a sprinkling of science fiction.In Siberia, 1906, anthropologist Alexander Saxton (Lee) finds a frozen creature which he believes to be the Missing Link. He transports the being back to western Europe by trans-Siberian train. Aboard the train are the usual assorted types- a Polish countess (Silvia Tortosa); her husband (Jorge Rigaud); a mad monk seemingly modelled on Rasputin (Alberto De Mendoza); and a fellow scientist and long-time rival of Saxton's, the charismatic Dr Wells (Cushing). Midway through the journey, as the train passes through a desolate snowscape many miles from civilisation, the creature thaws out and begins killing the passengers. Wells carries out an autopsy on the corpses and realises that they are not up against the Missing Link, but a weird alien organism which inhabits the bodies of its victims and steals their memories. As the finger of suspicion falls upon each character, the scientists try to figure out which passenger is carrying the shape-shifting monster, while trying to keep everyone safe and alive.Horror Express has its share of dumb moments (what horror film doesn't?) but in the main it is quite an intelligent and original piece. Some of the supporting actors are quite amateurish, too, giving performances that distract one's attention for the wrong reasons. However, Cushing and Lee are believable as always, and it's their straight-faced conviction which makes the story as spine-tingling as it is. There is also a well-developed subtext in the film condemning religious fanaticism, with Mendoza's character shown to be so unreasonable and misguided that his Christian rantings are every bit as disturbing as the teachings of a heretic. The atmosphere is spookily maintained, with lots of eerie scenes (which probably got many a heart fluttering back in 1973, in the pre-Exorcist days of the horror genre). In particular, the climactic sequence in which Cossack soldiers, led by Telly Savalas, board the train only to be zombified by the deadly alien, is a chilling episode. You may need to be a fan of old-school horror flicks to enjoy Horror Express, but if you are it's definitely one worth seeking out.
