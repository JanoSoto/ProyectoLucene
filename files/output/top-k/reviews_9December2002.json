Admittedly, the film-makers had quite a task on their hands in attempting to convert such a ponderous, pretentious, twee and long-winded book into something vaguely enjoyable- but, surely, it didn't have to be this bad- around three hours of empty bombast, CGI over-indulgence, unintentionally hilarious pseudo-archaic dialogue (Return the ring to Mount Doom from whence it came- how laughably portentous can you get?) and unintentionally unfunny jokes make for a miserable cinematic experience, not helped by the stilted, career-worst performances from such usually-reliable actors as Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Cate Blanchett. Perhaps the greatest tragedy of all is the depressing fact that this was directed by the once-great Peter Jackson, a man responsible for some of the most deliriously enjoyable and anarchic films of the last twenty years in Bad Taste, Braindead and Meet the Feebles.  His early work may be cheap, nasty, offensive, sick and excessively violent, but at least they were FUN. This film feels like a long, LONG trip through the diseased mind of a Tolkien enthusiast- in other words, tedious, self-important and depressing.

I've seen and read a lot of Shakespeare, but this is going to be one of the defining versions for me. The Oliver version just doesn't compare.I just loved the way the film mixed the 1930s with the Elizabethan; for example the 30s-style version of a Marlowe's Passionate Shepherd (an Elizabethan hit Shakespeare himself quoted), which had a tune I can still hum, or the Plantagenet urinals.  And all that's just in the first scene! The updating was in my view fully justified.  Folks, we have to remember that the War of the Roses was, in Elizabethan times, seen almost in the same way we see the First World War today.  It was thought to be that horrible. Maybe it wasn't really, but that's how it was perceived.  Anyone who tries to perform Shakespeare's history plays in their original setting today has somehow to solve the problem of making a modern audience feel the same sort of horror, otherwise you just end up with a lot of people in funny clothes running around doing funny things.  I'm not saying you should never do ahistory play in the original setting; Branagh's film of Henry IV is a good example of how you can, and succeed.  But you ask too much if you just put the play on as if you were in Elizabethan England, and expect the audience today to be able to react to the War of the Roses as an Elizabethan audience would. The modern connection with fascism is also perfectly reasonable. Shakespeare's Richard is fascist, and so was the real King Richard III, whoreally did haul Hastings out of a meeting and have him executed immediately,and really did have the Princes in the Tower murdered.  This was shocking tothe Elizabethans; even Henry VIII could not have someone beheaded without atleast going through some sort of judicial or parliamentary process.  Howevermany modern audiences do not know this, and think it's just the sort of thing  they did in those days.  Setting the play in a fascist England helps usrealise how truly shocking Richard III's murders were.The film also gives us a chilling reminder of how narrowly England escaped from fascism (and I am English).  Fascism is not something uniquely German; it happened in Italy and Spain.  It could have happened in 20th century England.  If it had it might have looked something very like that, though  perhaps not with Plantagenet urinals.And yes, it is a pity so much was cut.

However he dumps her in the hope of getting a more appropriate girlfriend to help his ambitious at Harvard and beyond. Elle is destroyed but realises that if she gets into Harvard then she will be able to win him back. Studying hard she gets in with high scores but finds that her Valley lifestyle doesn't quite fit with those around her - but she stays herself and struggles to overcome her image as a dumb blonde.I got this on loan from a friend for free so I figured I'd give it a shot. This type of silly comedy isn't really by thing at all. The plot is basically a write-off from day one. I know that in essence there's nothing stopping a valley girl with a fashion major doing law at Harvard but Elle's rise to power is too hard to swallow even in this type of comedy. The final court case (despite being wholly unlikely) is enjoyable but again, Elle only seems to be good at law when issues of style are major case points - does no-one else notice that this is the only thing she's good at!? The romance story is OK and the whole film handles itself well with a light bubbly feel to it, I never found it laugh out loud funny but it was nice and silly for 90 minutes.Witherspoon is well cast but I did find it difficult to get behind a girl who had everything given to her on a plate. The film holds her up as a sympathy figure - oh look the students are making fun of her. That's fine but the film also makes fun of the students who have done worthy things and have had to slave to get to Harvard - no sympathy for them? Wilson is always worth a watch despite having nothing much to do. Blair is good in a clichéd part while Garber's value is summed up by the fact that I only found him amusing by being familiar with his Alias character!Overall this is an enjoyable piece of fluff. Many will be put off by the total lack of logic or story but plenty will enjoy as a silly waste of 90 minutes. I must say I didn't find it very funny but it was breezy enough to be fun and then be forgotten. To give you an idea of how fluffy and unmemorable it is - I only saw it 12 hours ago but am struggling to write a good review because it's already slipping out of my mind....still passed the time though!

Directed by Edgar Ulmer on a miniscule budget, it's a very cheap film, and looks it, yet this works in its favor, giving it a nightmare quality (ever have a nightmare in Technicolor and Panavision?).Martin Goldsmith story is pure pulp stuff, though some of the dialogue, especially between the leading character and a guy who gives him a ride, is sharp and credible. The acting is variable, with Tom Neal looking so forlorn at the start of his journey that one wouldn't be surprised if he'd been picked up on suspicion. Of what? Anything. He just looks suspicious. As the woman from hell he meets up with, Ann Savage is terrifying from her first glance. She was either a great unsung actress or a crazy woman who just happened to get fortuitously cast and was merely playing herself. Her scenes with the passively hunky Neal are bizarre and convincing. They play not so much off as against each other, as people in real life often do.This is essentially a depressing movie about people living on the fringes of society; on highways, diners and used car lots. The pessimism is of the kind that was fashionable in the forties, though most noirs have fancier or at least more appealing settings. I think that part of Detour's appeal, aside from its being very well-made, is that it's about people they don't tend to make movies about.

But instead of talking about normal counseling things, she is talking about what flavors go together and other food-oriented things. The psychologist asks why she bothers coming, and she says that she only comes because her boss insists.It seems that Martha is an outstanding cook, but is a little temperamental. Okay, maybe more than a little. If a customer has a complaint, her response is to attack the customer's lack of taste rather than to smooth the situation over. One is reminded of the film Big Night in these scenes. Needless to say, this doesn't work well. Oh, and Martha also has a tendency to hide in the restaurant's walk-in freezer when she gets overwhelmed by what's going on around her in the kitchen.The second main character is another chef named Mario (Sergio Castellitto, who looks a bit like Barry Manilow). Martha assumes that he is intended to replace her when her boss hires him, and in fact he is very talented. I won't say much more, although this axis of the film is not exactly surprising.The third main character is actually introduced before Mario, but because this character is not on the film poster and there is more surprise involved, I won't say more, except that this character's introduction makes a very large difference in Martha's life.It's very hard to pin this film down. It is often funny, but it's also a drama, and a cooking demonstration, and more. The performances are all good, the story moves clearly but not overly predictably, and the film looks good. It is surprising to learn that it was made by a first-time feature film director.You won't finish the film as hungry as you would after seeing Big Night, but you will want something good to eat.

She might have won an Academy Award for her performance but the films was made on loan, so her studio didn't push for her. Her acting in this one doesn't come off well by today's standards. As the heartless waitress who jerks Philip, a sensitive medical student, around and nearly ruins his life, Davis is way too shrill, almost demonic. Director John Cromwell, who usually elicited good performances from his actresses, was perhaps overwhelmed by this one. Davis is watchable, for sure, but so strident and predatory as to seem scarcely human. I imagine the character of Millie as quieter, less feminine than Davis, with maybe a touch of the tomboy. Davis is such a strong, immediate presence that's there's no air of mystery to her, which makes Philip's attraction to her seem more overtly masochistic than it should be.As Philip, Leslie Howard is excellent. His wan, somewhat wilted good looks are perfect for this failed aesthete. Nor does he impose a personal interpretation on the part, as, say, Dirk Bogarde might have done, which gives his work a rare clarity. He seems completely in control here, as he should be, playing a man with a rational intellect who is in the grip of irrational emotions he cannot manage or even fully satisfy, as the object of his affections moves him in ways he cannot understand. Howard was a fine actor, too often cast in standard romantic parts which compelled him to fall back on charm, which he doesn't use here.It's been so long since I've read the book I don't feel comfortable commenting on the movie's faithfulness to it. I think it captures the spirit of the story well enough, and that it has in Howard a perfect Philip Carey. The sexual undercurrents are muted, and at times Philip behaves so masochistically that in the absence of strong sex feelings makes one wonder about the character's sanity, surely not Mr. Maugham's intention. Thanks to Howard's performance, Philip remains firmly in focus, as one can see in his various responses to and yearnings for Millie the extremes to which a reasonable intellect will go to understand the irrational, in himself and in others. Overall, a very good film, a little stilted at times, due to its age, it evokes London nicely, and is well acted for the most part.

First I'll start with the things that are wrong...The most obvious component of the movie that lets it down is Heather Graham. Her performance is below par at best and downright terrible at worst. Her accent is all over the place and she never seems at ease with the material or her role in the film. She's also far too clean and well scrubbed when compared to the other prostitutes in the film. She doesn't look like a streetwalker. I wish they would have got Samantha Morton to play the role instead...The film's other major problem is another accent; Johhny Depp's. To be honest, I think his performance is pretty good. He certainly conveys the weary, tired emotions that Abberline feels, but the cockney accent is more mockney than anything else. I'm not sure what it's meant to be. However, apart from that, he's excellent in the role...To the film's strengths though. The sense of atmosphere is superb. The production design, costumes and photography give the film tangible quality. It is truly, despite the horrid events that take place, a beautiful film to look at. It's also to the Hughes brothers' credit that the visual stylings that could have ended up as excessive indulgencies really add to the film. Lapse time photography is used, colours are changed, underwater shots are used, short flashes are spliced in, and all of them work. They give the film a vibrancy and energy.The rest of the cast also add greatly to the film. Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm in particular are superb. Both give performances that eclipse the leads and both appear to be working effortlessly...The script is also pretty good. It's a fictionalised take on the events, so there's no question of squabbling about authenticity. All that matters is that as a story, in my opinion, it works. It twists, it turns, and it provides a few surprises along the way. It certainly could have been better, but it could have been a lot worse too...All in all, I think From Hell is a pretty decent attempt. It doesn't indulge in the vacuous blood letting of teenage slasher films and provides the viewer with a decent interpretation of the Ripper myth.

Wesley Snipes' charisma and strong presence accompanied by Kris Kristofferson's calmer talent with the over-the-top special effects and martial arts made the first film a very nice experience and piece of 90's Hollywood genre cinema. The sequel isn't quite as positive an experience but still has its moments and positive things.Snipes is again Blade, the half human, half vampire, vampire killer trying and willing to save the world from the bloodsuckers that inhabit everything and can be everywhere as long as there's no sunlight, silver or garlic near them. The sequel has a new kind of vampire breed that fights and feeds on also the normal vampires and very soon Blade is forced to join forces to fight the more lethal and meaner enemy that cannot be discussed with at all. What follows is mayhem, blood, suckheads, typically not-so-deep characters, CGI effects and plenty of action. The sequel is written by David S. Goyer who also wrote the original Blade and for example The Dark City (1998) for Alex Proyas of the Crow (1994) fame. The plot is pretty simple and as it includes plenty of action and martial arts scenes, it is really pretty hard to feel bored while watching the film, at least I didn't feel at all. The beginning, the punch to the viewer senses, is very long and interior\/exterior based action spectacle that ends only when the film makers could be sure that no one in the audience was bored or not interested in the premise! The beginning gives some clues about the film's most interesting merits that are in the editing and photography departments. The editing is fast and fierce but not irritatingly and amateurishly so. It all serves the film's cartoon like (vampire) world in which words like slow, peaceful and safe are very rare and not so easy to be found in its everyday life. When the action begins, the speed is very fast and this is taken to its maximum effect by the hysterical editing and inventive usage of camera. There are many great and long drives and different speeds of the drives that make the film genuinely stylish as they are not used in vain and all the time but cleverly and restrainedly to add the effect only when the piece needed it. Also the dark scenes at the sewer and the infamous vampire bar are pretty atmospheric and there's also a brief but memorable bit of blue mist pushing through the windows and blinds to give the kind of incredibly beautiful and moody effect as in the greatest Hong Kong pieces like Ringo Lam's City on Fire (1987) and Danny Lee's Dr. Lamb (1992) and its stunning flashback scenes at the lamb's apartment. And this is not the only thing this film has in common with the Hong Kong films and makers.The fight choreographer is no less than the Chinese Donnie Yen who is known for his breath taking fighting talent in various Hong Kong films like Yuen Woo Ping's Iron Monkey (1993), Raymond Lee's New Dragon Gate Inn (1992) and Tsui Hark's Once Upon a Time in China 2 (1992). He also has a small role in Blade 2. The martial art fights (which are plenty, too) are, alongside the mentioned visuals, among the things that make the film's action so interesting and kinetic, and thus the film a bit close(r) to Hong Kong films. The major bad thing is the special effects that seem little too computer like and don't seem to fit to the film. The CGI gore and vampire killings are not so convincing and flawless but still nice to watch as in some computer or video game, but not in a film. The film is most likely equally violent with the first film, but the first film had much more effective and inventive special and vampire effects than this sequel. Especially the beginning of part one is among the greatest beginnings I've seen for long time in any horror attempt.The needless shock epilogue is also a very irritating and seems to be there as if the screenwriter had had one minute to write it and then decide, during the same minute, whether it will be included in the film or not! Also the usual one liners could be completely lacking but fortunately they are not too irritating and entertaining. Blade 2 is harmless and fast paced piece of Hollywood horror and action film and in its own unpretentious genre it is among the more interesting and definitely professional attempts for some time and well worth a look for those interested in the genre. Definitely should be seen on the big screen as (of course) any other film, too.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 December 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Guillermo Del Toro (Cronos (1993), Mimic (1997), The Devil's Backbone (2001)) directed this fast and furious sequel, Blade 2 (2002), to Stephen Norrington's original Blade (1998) that gave hope for something interesting and personal to come out from Hollywood in this horror\/action department.

The essence of what the film is about is summarized in the quote, `every body dies alone,' which is repeated throughout. What that means is that your death is only your own. No one can help you deal with it or help you understand it. DONNIE DARKO is about Donnie understanding and coming to terms with his own death. By the end of the film he sees the relevance of his death. As a result he ends up saving a lot of people's lives. The final shots of the film are brief cuts between faces of people that his death will affect. It is as if to say that all these people have no idea what a sacrifice he is making for them. One of the people whose face you see is Patrick Swayze's character. He happens to be crying, which again indicates that he is a sad and confused man rather than an evil person. Now the rabbit that visits Donnie has little to do with the character that Donnie kills later except to bridge the present with the eventual future (the same way the engine device does). The rabbit can be compared to the devil. He saves Donnie's life and as a result, Donnie listens to him unconditionally, before realizing that he has been fooled. I'm not sure about the old lady, but I think that she is a character that missed her chance to do what Donnie does at the end. Since she knows about the `time travel' she may have had a chance to use it, but chose not too. She has grown mad ever since. I cannot say anything about her definitely since I just did not pay enough attention to her story in my one viewing.So now the film takes on a few meanings. Donnie Darko is like a superhero (hence the name) because, using his powers (time travel), he saves the lives of many by sacrificing himself. Like any hero, he is an outsider with deep thoughts and doubts about his destiny. His character dying for the people in his community can also be compared to Jesus Christ dying on the cross for everyone (Only symbolically, I'm not saying that Donnie is Jesus' equal). Donnie dies so that people's lives can be preserved. He even dies for the flawed ones such as Patrick Swayze's character (who now can be seen as a sort of false prophet) just like Jesus died for sinners. The reason that I am comparing Donnie to Jesus is because there is a very specific and very obvious reference to Scorsese's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST in the movie. Donnie walks out of a theater where THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST is playing right after the movie he is watching. The shot moves up from Donnie's face to the title up on the board. It's a pretty obvious juxtaposition. THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST has a similar plot structure. Jesus imagines himself getting off the cross and continuing a normal life. He eventually realizes that he has been fooled into doing this by the devil and returns to die on his cross as intended. It is a mental struggle inside Jesus' mind. This is why the rabbit that visits Donnie can be seen as the devil. He leads Donnie on the wrong path. Both films have key sequences at the end that evoke similar meanings. Jesus climbs back onto his cross and Donnie climbs back into his bed. Both have come to understand the importance of their death and are no longer scared to die. But don't get me wrong. You do not need to have seen THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST in order to understand DONNIE DARKO. The reference is probably only the director's way of quoting his influence. Others have pointed out some references to Faust, which could lead a discussion in a similar direction.Having said all that, I did like the movie. I do not think it is genius as it is nothing revolutionary and does have some holes. My main complaint is that while the atmosphere is out of a David Lynch film, the dialogue (like about the Smurfs) often seems to be Tarantino-like, and the actual themes that the film raises are seriously dramatic rather than scary as the atmosphere implies. It's a little bit messy. The ending does not come out of nowhere as it fits in fine with what has been built up, but the atmosphere created throughout most of the movie conceals what is significant. If you want to see a film that deals with the issues of fate, identity, and sacrifice more head-on, see THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. In my tedious explanation of the themes in DONNIE DARKO, I regret that I did not even get into what the movie's good qualities are, such as Richard Kelly's direction (for the most part; some complaints above). More important than all my answers and opinions are the questions that the movie raises. For example Did Donnie actually decide that he should die, or was that predetermined fate anyway? I think I know what the movie says, but I don't know if I will watch it again any time soon to review my thoughts. Any movie that inspires some debate and discussion can't be bad. It made me write way more than I should have. I give it an 8 out of 10.

The rabbit can be compared to the devil. He saves Donnie's life and as a result, Donnie listens to him unconditionally, before realizing that he has been fooled. I'm not sure about the old lady, but I think that she is a character that missed her chance to do what Donnie does at the end. Since she knows about the `time travel' she may have had a chance to use it, but chose not too. She has grown mad ever since. I cannot say anything about her definitely since I just did not pay enough attention to her story in my one viewing.So now the film takes on a few meanings. Donnie Darko is like a superhero (hence the name) because, using his powers (time travel), he saves the lives of many by sacrificing himself. Like any hero, he is an outsider with deep thoughts and doubts about his destiny. His character dying for the people in his community can also be compared to Jesus Christ dying on the cross for everyone (Only symbolically, I'm not saying that Donnie is Jesus' equal). Donnie dies so that people's lives can be preserved. He even dies for the flawed ones such as Patrick Swayze's character (who now can be seen as a sort of false prophet) just like Jesus died for sinners. The reason that I am comparing Donnie to Jesus is because there is a very specific and very obvious reference to Scorsese's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST in the movie. Donnie walks out of a theater where THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST is playing right after the movie he is watching. The shot moves up from Donnie's face to the title up on the board. It's a pretty obvious juxtaposition. THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST has a similar plot structure. Jesus imagines himself getting off the cross and continuing a normal life. He eventually realizes that he has been fooled into doing this by the devil and returns to die on his cross as intended. It is a mental struggle inside Jesus' mind. This is why the rabbit that visits Donnie can be seen as the devil. He leads Donnie on the wrong path. Both films have key sequences at the end that evoke similar meanings. Jesus climbs back onto his cross and Donnie climbs back into his bed. Both have come to understand the importance of their death and are no longer scared to die. But don't get me wrong. You do not need to have seen THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST in order to understand DONNIE DARKO. The reference is probably only the director's way of quoting his influence. Others have pointed out some references to Faust, which could lead a discussion in a similar direction.Having said all that, I did like the movie. I do not think it is genius as it is nothing revolutionary and does have some holes. My main complaint is that while the atmosphere is out of a David Lynch film, the dialogue (like about the Smurfs) often seems to be Tarantino-like, and the actual themes that the film raises are seriously dramatic rather than scary as the atmosphere implies. It's a little bit messy. The ending does not come out of nowhere as it fits in fine with what has been built up, but the atmosphere created throughout most of the movie conceals what is significant. If you want to see a film that deals with the issues of fate, identity, and sacrifice more head-on, see THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. In my tedious explanation of the themes in DONNIE DARKO, I regret that I did not even get into what the movie's good qualities are, such as Richard Kelly's direction (for the most part; some complaints above). More important than all my answers and opinions are the questions that the movie raises. For example Did Donnie actually decide that he should die, or was that predetermined fate anyway? I think I know what the movie says, but I don't know if I will watch it again any time soon to review my thoughts. Any movie that inspires some debate and discussion can't be bad. It made me write way more than I should have. I give it an 8 out of 10.

This is a legitimate case of the Form matching the Content. And I truly feel that this movie accurately--very accurately-- illustrates the landscape of dreams. Some people have felt that the rotoscoping animation grates after a while but I feel that it's probably the movie's greatest asset the live-action painted over by computer animation results in images that look both real and unreal, that look more to be based on something that's real than being real itself--and that's exactly how images look and feel in dreams (at least in my dreams).That said, I won't go so far as saying this movie is a cinematic masterpiece, as some people have asserted. Long, static, philosophical discussions and a bunch of Talking Heads don't really belong in a movie, which needs developed characters and a consistent conflict that runs like a thread throughout the story. On that level, the movie falls short.At its best, though, the movie works on two levels On one level, it's the story about a guy who's trying to wake up from a metaphorical sleep of ignorance and unawareness. On a second level, which is more speculative and ambiguous than the first, it's the story about a guy who has just died and is experiencing nearly 120 minutes of post-mortal consciousness.Some might disagree with the second story possibility, but I personally believe that it's the movie's Real story. There are some hints scattered throughout the film which seem to indicate that Wiley Wiggins' character is dead (spoilers ahead) 1. early in the movie, right before Wiggins gets hit by the car, he gets a ride in a boat-car which has a skull-and-crossbones banner hanging from it; 2. there are three scenes where Wiggins rides on a train, which implies that some kind of transitional Transportation is taking place--he's moving from one realm (life) to another (death); 3. the film starts in the daytime and gradually builds to nighttime where it ends--in literature (which this movie alludes to several times), night has always represented Death;  4. in the scene where Wiggins tells the red-headed woman that he believes he's dreaming, he ends by saying But this dream is different--it's almost as if I'm being prepared for something RIGHT AFTER he says that, we see him briefly on the train again, and right after that, we see him on a bridge which, like the train, represents transition, a change from one state to another;  5. in the Night scenes at the end, random people pass by Wiggins, making cryptic comments about death (i.e.- Kiergegaard's last words were 'sweep me up'.) it's as if these people are trying to tell the Wiggins that he's dead.Seen from this latter perspective, the movie plays almost like a tragedy a man, about to die, looks back on his life (just like the old woman whom Julie Delpy mentions early in the movie) and realizes that he has been none other than an observer, a watcher, a listener rather than a Doer.
