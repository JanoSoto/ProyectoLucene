As Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) descends her California home's spiral staircase, we are as enraptured as Neff. And it takes little time to figure out that being enraptured by this femme fatale is a very dangerous position to find oneself in. Is it accidental that the bracelet is worn around her ankle, as opposed to the more traditional wrist? Is it accidental that the sunlight streaming through the windows cast shadows not unlike bars across the living room? I suspect it's about as accidental as Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers) eventually ending up dead along the railroad tracks. We must remember that Billy Wilder is doing more than evoking noir here, he's inventing it. And how brave he is! Beginning the film by all but divulging the ending is hardly the route most directors choose to go when directing a thriller. But as he's well aware, the audience doesn't care half as much about where they end up as they do about the thrill of the ride it takes to get them there. The structure of the film is familiar to anyone who has seen Body Heat, or any other knockoff. Double Indemnity is the original however, and it's intricate plot revels in its complexities nearly as much as Walter and Phyllis do in their convoluted plot to dispose of an unwanted husband. The audience learns only a minimum about the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Dietrichson, but we easily surmise that their union was not out of love. If the marriage was one of convenience, than the murder certainly is. It seems unlikely Phyllis is after the freedom to continue her heady tryst with Walter, and even the money provided by the double indemnity clause of Mr. Dietrichson's life insurance policy seems more like a bonus than a motivation. In other words, Phyllis just wants her husband dead. And Neff obliges. Several times while watching Double Indemnity, I felt my pulse physically quicken. These scenes were most notably the ones in which it looked as though Walter and Phyllis' trolley car had finally reached the end of its line, and discovery of their crime was inevitable. The scene where Phyllis is forced to hide behind a door, knowing that incrimination awaits if the person on the other side sees her, is unrelenting in its suspense. After all, we want this reprehensible act to go off without a hitch every bit as much as they do. That is the sign of a good film. It also stands to reason, seeing as how we were there when the elaborate scheme was being plotted. That makes us accessories. And if they get caught, God help us, so do we.

He was a great Director. But Capra's detractors said he was known for his corn rather than art. If truth is art, then Capra fails, not to entertain, but as a truth teller. Capra is one of the first message directors. In this movie, he goes against the Washington establishment, political hacks and powers behind the throne. The sad fact is that nothing has changed because human nature has not changed. Capra creates the Character of Jefferson Smith, played by Jimmy Stewart in an great performance. The supporting cast performs as well under the direction of Capra. Whether Capra or the writers are to blame is not known, but the Smith character is a caricature of a real person. And because he is not real and the story is not reality. If this movie was considered a comedy, so be it, but critics have had 60 plus years to consider this movie as a significant comment on good versus evil. Stewart's character is chosen by a shallow Governor to fill a US Senate seat and his choice is not the best candidate for the job. Nothing unbelievable in that, , but Smith's character is stretched beyond belief. To become a US Senator, you must be at least 30 years old. Smith is introduced as someone with the maturity of a 15 year old. With no wife, no girl friend; he acts like a 15 year old when introduced to mature women. Taking a tour of Washington leaving his homing pigeons to the care of others, is also the behavior of an adolescent. Capra wants us to believe that adolescence is synonymous with honesty. It is not. Nor was his striking journalists who portrayed him as a dope.Somehow this idealistic character takes on the corruption of the world in the form of a junior Senator and conquers all. And discovers love and gets the girl in the end. If you like vintage syrup, this movie is right for you. Just remember, its just a movie, and in real life, the bad guys usually win.

Two other females are still working at the precinct as it is almost completely emptied in the move to another precinct.

A little girl is shot point-blank by a gang member of the Cholo's..it's in a cold, non-emotional way which leaves a bitter taste. That curdling evil murder points out to us that the Cholo gang is completely cut-off from feeling anything remotely human. They simply serve their own cause to kill anyone that doesn't represent whatever cause they believe in. Why they do what they do is not explained which might drive some viewers crazy, but I think that doesn't matter much in Carpenter's whole grand scheme of things. Why did certain kids open fire on the school of Columbine? Why do killers attack innocents in the first place? It's not an easy question to answer.

Bishop will have to release Wilson and another prisoner, Wells(Tony Burton)after many were shot to death as they were attempting to get back on the prison exchange bus in the back of the precinct. Bishop and Wilson form a quiet camaraderie as they fight those marauders outside..there's respect here that isn't perhaps present when either are around their peers. Interesting developments occur between Wilson and Leigh as well. I liked this particularly because if you read between the lines they fall in love during the crisis, but speak without saying too much. Yet, they know how they feel about each other and need not say it out loud.The film works best as an action pic about which group will out-smart the other. The Cholo gang work well to try and keep anyone from noticing their strikes against the precinct. They remove all the bodies and any other evidence of their attacks. The Cholo gang is calm and methodical..they have a goal and do everything in their power to achieve just that. Our heroes inside have to come up with an intelligent counter-attack..and do it fast because they are the ones at the disadvantage.

And really I'm not too sure who's to blame. Probably least of which is Mel Gibson, who is still impeccably strong as a the hero of the series, and who in this film- no matter where the epic, lumbering, what-the-hell-logic-wise script takes him- is always in fine form with a bit of humor here and there too. I'd say if anything the flaws might be a combination of two things- the script, which seems to have a focus for the first half and then once transitioning into a second part that might SEEM to connect into the first part goes off the rails into a blender of brawny chase and action sequences, and then the whole scope of the production itself, which is almost too big for its britches, so to speak. Damn it all if Miller and his team don't get major points for ambition, and for trying something different than just the high-voltage exploitation-satire flicks the first two Mad Max's were. But amid the high ideals and shooting-for-the-mainstream tactics, it becomes a case of being too much and too confusing for one common movie-goer to take. What started as a series made perfectly and astonishingly for the drive-in theaters and B-movie houses (and the Road Warrior being one of the very best ever made in that tradition), becomes a near-Peter Pan type of story of good versus, um, evil I guess.Max this time seems to be after a mysterious pilot called Jedediah (Bruce Spence, who is in a similar role but not exactly, kind of like in a Leone film I guess), and it leads him into the dingy, dangerous, pig-s*** powered Bartertown, who is lead by a brain and a brawn sort of combined (one midget, and one very large man), but seen as a threat and possible advantage to Aunt Entity (Tina Turner). She makes a deal with Max to get rid of the brawn for fuel and whatever else he might want, all to take place in the Thunderdome. This is quite a battle that ends up being waged, a very creatively staged bout where the two men go in, one man only to come out (as the on-lookers chant feverishly), with any given weapon at their disposal. When the plan doesn't go quite right though, Max is cast out into the desert, and left for dead... then found by a group of kids who have a few adults in the group of outcasts, and all think that Max is a Captain of some sort, their former leader. He isn't, but somehow he becomes apart of them finding their tomorrow-morrow land, but it just really leads back to Barter-town, among other things.That's the basic gist of the story, as much as I could make of it. The flow of the story is interesting in how it moves sometimes with the same tenacity and edginess of the previous two films, most particularly with Max's time in Barter-town and how easily things can be broken if the one rule of Thunderdome is broken. It's when he goes 'Beyond' it that the script sputters and then starts up only sometimes. What laid also in the previous two films, however subtly in the first one and really with one big point (oil) in the 2nd film, with sort of social points being made, are harder to find this time around. I guess if there is any one sociological point or other it's that any sort of mini-society that forms itself is bound by convictions and ideals of what either works best (as in Barter-town) or what could lie outside in what lay in the past with the cities and civilizations. But the two appealing sides of the picture sort of collide with one another- it's neither a family film or a real mature action picture, but a weird hybrid of the two. It's a little unsettling at times to watch, like a film made right out of the desert, dirty and violent and quite unusual, and with the cuter tendencies of Return of the Jedi.This is not to say directors George Miller and George Ogilvie don't try to make it as exciting as it could be, and the final climactic battle\/chase that happens between the two sides, however incoherent it becomes, does deliver better than anything else in the picture. I liked seeing how, in a sense, Miller was trying to take the scope of the climax in Road Warrior, with an important, big vehicle on the run, with little menacing vulture-type villains riding along to stop at nothing to take it down, and make it even bigger than before. But by this point I didn't really have any idea what the destination was for either side, or why the Barter-town cars were still going after them even when they already lost getting back 'the Brain'. In the end, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome carries some mesmerizing images of wastelands and people unbound from hope trying to cling to something more, and in the middle is a hero who almost becomes second tier to everything else that is going on. It's admirable and still some fun, but it's definitely least in my ranking of the three films. 6.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 December 2006","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" What a fascinating mess Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is.

It continues in the time honored way by having the stagecoach held up by a band of outlaws, led by Glenn Ford as the wily Ben Wade. Then it introduces the protagonist, Dan Evans (played Van Heflin), and the whole timing and purpose of the story begins to lose momentum.All the establishing shots are simply brilliant, but the actors are by turns wooden, clueless, or clichéd, and only the town drunk seems to have any motivation or personality. My impression upon first viewing was that it was meant to be just another churned out formula piece, but that the cinematographer (Charles Lawton Jr.) chose to be extraordinary and visionary in spite of his humble circumstances. The shot where one of the Gang guys is scoping out the tiny town of Contention and the camera rises about five stories above the action and follows him as he circles around into the main street is beyond anything the poor, miserable screenwriter could possibly ever have envisioned, and therefore made his pathetic lack of decent dialog seem even more disjointed and disorienting. I felt that Glenn Ford just didn't have the chops to handle the hidden menace of his character, and that his sloppy grin and sideways glance never once conveyed a sense of real danger. The tense scene in the hotel room was interesting at times, but mostly for how cleverly it was shot, and the actress playing the bar girl, Felicia Farr, did a very good job of playing a sort of enigmatic victim of circumstance, a quality sorely lacking in any of the characters around her. Otherwise, a B-movie sort of drama, with an indulgent 50's television quality to the direction, so not much else to recommend it. But if awesome camera genius is your cup of tea, you will be greatly rewarded, and might even want to watch it again and again, just to study all the great visual choices that were made without repetition or clichés. I didn't hate this movie, simply found that its style far surpassed its substance, to the point where it took away from my ability to simply enjoy it as a mediocre Western. It might have worked better in my mind with John Ford as director and John Wayne as the bad guy, but that was not meant to be. Only recommended for the beautiful sets and cinematography. Otherwise go watch Shane for true depth, drama and realistic poignancy.

Still, Elliott Gould's characterization could hardly be any more different to Chandler's original vision or to Humphrey Bogart's definitive film portrayal in Howard Hawks' THE BIG SLEEP (1946) which, incidentally, is the greatest Film Noir ever in my book. Since a maverick like Altman was helming the film, one hardly expected him to stick to a conventional portrait but, understandably, having Marlowe inexplicably displaced to the liberalized 1970s era swarming with long-haired guys, pot-smoking chicks, slickly-dressed heels and vicious mobsters with body-builder thugs (one of them an uncredited Arnold Schwarzenegger!) was too much to take for 1940s Marlowe fans...which is all the more incredible when one realizes that the screenplay for this film was written by none other than THE BIG SLEEP's co-writer, Leigh Brackett! Having said that, however, Gould is clearly in top form here and further confirms that very few directors made more inspired use of him in their films, witness the amusing opening sequence where he tries to pass off a different brand of cat food to his feline pet because he is all out of its favorite Courry brand! Altman even introduces a parking lot attendant adept at mimicry and his Barbara Stanwyck impersonation from, appropriately enough, Billy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944), is a hoot.While the film has a few other notable qualities - Vilmos Zsigmond's inventive camera-work, John Williams' playful score and remarkable performances from Hollywood veteran Sterling Hayden (as an alcoholic writer on the skids) and film director Mark Rydell (as a mobster who thinks nothing of shattering a glass bottle on his girlfriend's face to prove to Marlowe that he means business) - eventually the film is far less entertaining than previous Marlowe outings which might well be the result of a much weaker storyline, the relative lack of the trademark hard-boiled dialogue and the glacial presence of Nina Van Pallandt which oozes very little of the sensuality so vital in a supposed femme fatale.Ultimately, the film is much more rewarding for Altman fans than the casual viewer especially when taking into account the director's other ingenious genre revisits of the 1970s - IMAGES (1972; the Horror film), THIEVES LIKE US (1974; Gangster), BUFFALO BILL AND THE INDIANS OR, SITTING BULL'S HISTORY LESSON (1976; Western) and QUINTET (1979; Sci-Fi) - which, despite all being worthwhile or interesting works at the very least, merely served to alienate him further from the Hollywood establishment for a prolonged period of time until that early 1990s renaissance came about.

Having said that, however, Gould is clearly in top form here and further confirms that very few directors made more inspired use of him in their films, witness the amusing opening sequence where he tries to pass off a different brand of cat food to his feline pet because he is all out of its favorite Courry brand! Altman even introduces a parking lot attendant adept at mimicry and his Barbara Stanwyck impersonation from, appropriately enough, Billy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944), is a hoot.While the film has a few other notable qualities - Vilmos Zsigmond's inventive camera-work, John Williams' playful score and remarkable performances from Hollywood veteran Sterling Hayden (as an alcoholic writer on the skids) and film director Mark Rydell (as a mobster who thinks nothing of shattering a glass bottle on his girlfriend's face to prove to Marlowe that he means business) - eventually the film is far less entertaining than previous Marlowe outings which might well be the result of a much weaker storyline, the relative lack of the trademark hard-boiled dialogue and the glacial presence of Nina Van Pallandt which oozes very little of the sensuality so vital in a supposed femme fatale.Ultimately, the film is much more rewarding for Altman fans than the casual viewer especially when taking into account the director's other ingenious genre revisits of the 1970s - IMAGES (1972; the Horror film), THIEVES LIKE US (1974; Gangster), BUFFALO BILL AND THE INDIANS OR, SITTING BULL'S HISTORY LESSON (1976; Western) and QUINTET (1979; Sci-Fi) - which, despite all being worthwhile or interesting works at the very least, merely served to alienate him further from the Hollywood establishment for a prolonged period of time until that early 1990s renaissance came about.

Matter of fact it's one of the worst, certainly in the field of Arnold Schwarzenegger's non-action film work. Gone are the actually funny lines and scenes to be found in Arnold's comedy collaborations in Ivan Reitman's films, and for the most part just really goofy sequences of action and suspense, leading to an ending that is about as ludicrous as can be (it's actually funny, in an unintentional way, how all of the main characters are duped as to who is Turbo-Man until the figure takes off his helmet, heh).Arnold plays a so-so father to a boy who just wants one thing for Christmas, aside from a loving and attentive father, which is the Turbo-Man action figure, the biggest thing to hit the shelves of the season, or maybe any season. The dummy he is, he thinks he can get a Turbo-Man on the 24th of December, when everyone is outside waiting for one in the packed holiday shopping frenzy. The filmmakers mean for this to all be a comment\/satirization of the whole frenzy, but it falls flat upon it having to be very 'kid-friendly'. It doesn't help matters that Sinbad is a major player in the picture, as an also out-of-touch postal-worker dad who is also vying for a Turbo-Man, at all costs. I never really found him much funny on his own show anyway, and with this script he doesn't do that much better with scenes that are forced with the comedy.Maybe a little better is Phil Hartman, who probably has the best line of the whole movie from my perspective (when he finds out Arnold's character is caught red-handed with his own Turbo-Man doll kept under his tree), you can't bench-press your way out of this one. But even he is subservient to a character who is too thin to even fit into a one-dimensional character of the 'very kind and generous but really sleazy' dad of the bunch. In the end, after a daring feat of unexpected do by Arnold in the Turbo-Man costume (wackiness, of course, brought the costume upon him, among other contrite comic conventions), the very last bit with the son is just that much more insulting. While once or twice I did feel that the comedy did work, if only on a very stupid, base level, like when Arnold has to face off against an actual reindeer, or parts of his trip into the world of Santa con-men, it's really a flat endeavor that only has gotten lesser in quality years later.When I was younger and watched it even then I thought it was just 'ok'. Today, I don't see it as being the complete bomb like Schwarzenneger's next film in 1997 would be (Batman & Robin), it comes close, as one of those studio pieces of product tripe that come through the wheel-works at the most wonderful time of the year. Maybe if nothing else is on TV it's worth several minutes to see if it might be your cup of tea. But for me, it's not something I really want to watch again anytime soon.

The idea alone that a bunch of ancient dragons in the modern world set in the new apocalypse and destroyed all the cities and killing basically every person on Earth, is an highly unlikely one. A movie with an unlikely concept and premise is per definition an unlikely and far from believable or likable movie. In the end the movie is just as silly as it at first sight sounds, even for a genre movie like this one.Problem is that the movie is totally lacking in good suspenseful action sequences. The fact that the movie is lacking in good action and tension absolutely has something to do with it that the movie never gets believable enough. The post-apocalypse world the movie is set in feels like it comes straight out of Waterworld or Mad Max. It also doesn't exactly make the movie original although the premise in its core is of course definitely new and original.Also the fact that the story is rather simple makes that this movie feels far from original or likable enough. They didn't attempt to make the movie any more interesting by putting more meaningful plot lines in it. There are plenty of enough characters in the movie though to do something more interesting with, story-wise.It is definitely not the actor's fault that the characters don't work out. I mean when you've a cast with Christian Bale, Matthew McConaughey, Izabella Scorupco and Gerard Butler, you can't accuse the movie of bad acting but you can accuse it of having bad characters and dialog. The Christian Bale character is supposed to be the main character but his character remains so shallow and uninteresting that you never really ever care much about him. I think that it would had been way better if the main character was an heroic one. A real action-hero, also perhaps played by a more likely action-hero star. It ironically is Matthew McConaughey in his totally over-the-top tough guy role that delivers the best performance of the movie and also puts down the most interesting character. He perhaps plays the most fun role out of his career (yet).The special effects are definitely not that bad but they way they are used are bad. Too many wide-shots and not enough close-ups. The movie could had also used way more sequences with the dragons in it and more action sequences in general. It would had made the movie at least more fun and interesting to watch. The dragons just don't feel as big destructive monsters in the movie, which also adds to the reason why the movie is lacking in good suspenseful or believable action.Further more the movie is definitely good looking with some good cinematography from Adrian Biddle and good looking sets and costumes. The directing is also quite good but it could had used more depth and creativity at times.

Let's lower the numbers SIGNIFICANTLY and assume that the invaders could have conquered with a ratio of 0.5-1 (absolute craziness--however, I am willing to suspend disbelief).Since this movie (by the movie's own script line) states that nuke usage was kept to a minimum and we are now in a conventional war--assuming this true, then the Soviet\/Cuban and Nicaraguan (what a laugh) troop invasion force strength would have had to be around 70,000,000 (70 MILLION) troops. This also assumes that the CAPABLE fighting population of the US would have been around 140 million (eliminates babies, the elderly, sick, and kids under the age of 8). That would have been a piece of cake given the 1984 demographics.BTW One of the targets that was taken out was apparently Washington, DC. Who came up with this target? You never take out the decision making center because at some point, if your invasion WERE successful, you need to have politicians to make peace terms.So the Soviets have 70 million versus 140 million. Next question, How does the Soviet Union manage to move 70 million troops (oh yeah....how about all that heavy equipment....tanks, armored troop carriers, etc) to the CONUS Continental United States)?That is a heck of a lot of troops to move into the US. Something was mentioned about using commercial aircraft for the initial wave. A 747 back then would have held about 350 to 380 persons depending on the configuration. If you wanted to move even a million troops in for the first wave on international flights....do the math yourself.I don't have any problems with feel good movies and I agree with those who have posted on here that one of the reasons it would be so difficult to invade and take the US would be precisely because HUGE population groups would become militia and fight using guerrilla tactics. There is no doubt about that.I just have a certain level where I can suspend my disbelief.BTW We were heavily supporting El Salavdor back at that time. Somehow, the Nicaraguan army was able to move right thru without our US troops and the El Salvador military making any efforts to stop them.I give the film a 2 out of 10 for SERIOUS FILM ratings. This film is not even close to the league of films like The Third Man, The Shankshaw Redemption, and even Saving Private Ryan. So the IMDb really ought to allow TWO film ratings.....no way to compare something like this to classics.However, in terms of unintended consequences, this film is a good one to kick back and laugh at (the unintended points).

The two primary co-stars, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear provide equally-competent, engaging performances, along with Cuba Gooding, Shirley Knight, and everyone in the remaining supporting cast.It is a very long movie, nearly 2-1\/3 hours in length - but so enjoyable it seems like one of those shorter hour-and-a-half films. This is a true test of a completely-enjoyable presentation - and thankfully, the producers didn't try to cut its length to conform to a more normal movie theater show schedule.The entire story, all of the characters, and their relationships with one another, one-on-one or in some sort of grouping, entertain without pause or exception during the entire film.Melvin and all his cohorts are a group you're not likely to forget.Some of the folks on this site have characterized Helen Hunt's character\/performance as annoying. Ms. Hunt is not my favorite actress, but while agreeing her character here was annoying - I would add that I feel this was a necessary, understandable component of her character. Here was a waitress, living with New York expenses, commuting from one borough to another, and with a son with a bad case of asthma, hospital emergency runs, etc. (I have family experience with such asthmatic-triggered emergencies, although thankfully, without her character's financial and insurance problems.) All of the circumstances surrounding her life and work would certainly provide this sort of comportment. Further, since most of her character's displays of an annoying demeanor were with Melvin, a rich, neurotic individual, obsessed with self-centered trivialities, she couldn't logically avoid being impatient and less-than-empathetic to his seemingly (to her) relatively petty frustrations.
