It seemed that Preston was my third favorite, the love sick boy just made me crack up.

Sounds like the kind of fantasy that Disney, the same studio that did the remake of Angels in the Outfield in 1994, would come up with.Well, the story does come to you courtesy of Disney, only this time the fantasy is reality. It is the true story of Jim Morris and his amazing odyssey from the faculty lounge to the Major Leagues in The Rookie.In the film, Dennis Quaid plays Morris, the former Major League prospect turned high school baseball coach in Big Lake, Texas, who in 1999 makes a deal with his players. If they win the divisional championship, he in return would try out for a Major League team. Of course, they win, forcing Morris to try out for the Devil Rays. And to the surprise of everyone, including himself, he ends up on the fast track to the big leagues with a consistent 98-mph fastball.I just found it inspirational, said Quaid. If it was a piece of fiction I don't think I would have done it. It's just too unbelievable. He was teaching high school science in May in some little town in Big Lake, Texas, and in September he's standing on the pitching mound in a Major League ballpark fulfilling his dream. You couldn't be more storybook about it.Morris, now 38, who retired from baseball after appearing in 16 games with the Devil Rays in 2000, says the events of 1999 changed the direction of his life.I think it opened my eyes to second chances, he said. I'm trying to teach my kids in high school a lesson and they end up teaching me a lesson and that in itself is a second chance. Kids see themselves helping an adult and I think that inspires them. I never would have tried to play baseball again if it weren't for them. I'd been out of the game for 10 1\/2 years.While pitching for the Devil Rays' Triple-A affiliate in Durham, NC, Morris got a call from Mark Ciardi, an aspiring film producer who happened to be a former teammate of Morris' when the two played together in the Milwaukee Brewers' farm system in the mid 1980s. Ciardi and his partner, Gordon Gray, convinced Morris that his story would make a wonderful feature film and immediately set up a meeting with Disney.With Mike Rich and John Lee Hancock on board as writer and director, the filmmakers had to find the right man to play Morris. They chose Quaid, who has played football stars in the films Everybody's All American and Any Given Sunday and has starred in several other had a string of both critical a commercial hits including Breaking Away, The Right Stuff and, more recently, Traffic.Quaid, who grew up in Houston and says that the old Colt 45's of Bob Aspromonte, Rusty Staub and Jimmy Wynn were his boyhood idols, had not picked up a baseball in nearly 30 years.I hadn't played baseball since I was in Little League, so it was quite a challenge, said Quaid. I was always a baseball fan, but I hadn't played in years. Getting the pitching motion down was the most important thing. I didn't want to look like I threw like an actress.So the producers hired former Dodger and Pirate reliever Jim Gott to work with Quaid.We had the luxury of three months before we started shooting, said Quaid. Jim would come over to my house and we'd throw balls in the front yard, we'd go over to Dodger Stadium once a week and throw over there. That was very exciting and we would just work at getting the pitching motion down.Gott says the 46-year-old actor was a very good student.We just went through the ritual of what a pitcher goes through, said Gott. An offseason training program is what I tried to work with him on. A throwing program of three to five days. Three days in the beginning. We just began to work on his mechanics. Dennis is an athlete already, I think he has more big league time with his football movies and now his baseball movie than I ever did in the big leagues. Here's a guy who's a huge star, who takes his craft seriously, but he loves the athletic side of things and he was able to adapt to whatever training program we had for him right off the bat.When he wasn't throwing, Gott had Quaid study videotape of a baseball legend.I gave Dennis a tape of Sandy Koufax pitching in the seventh game of the 1965 World Series against the Minnesota Twins, said Gott. I felt he should learn from the best and Sandy helped me a lot in my career with the Dodgers. Dennis was always looking for the finer points of what looked right and what seemed right. I felt being a lefty and playing a power pitcher like Jim Morris and Sandy being the best lefty power pitcher ever, that this is a tape he should see and he loved it.The entire process gave Quaid a deeper understanding of the game.I now have a better appreciation for pitchers, said Quaid. I've always been a baseball fan, but now I can watch a game with a little different point of view having delved just a little bit into Jim's world.Morris was impressed with Quaid's work as an actor and a pitcher.He threw everyday, said Morris. He got to the point as a pitcher, as pitchers do, before he let the ball go, he knew if the pitch was bad or not -- he was amazing. He did a lot of work.Morris is also pleased with the way his life is portrayed on film.I'm just so happy with the way it turned out, said Morris. I actually got to see a finished product about three weeks ago in Nashville with the religious broadcaster's convention and they didn't know I was in the theatre until it was over and I had to dry my eyes before I could get up and talk to them.Quaid says The Rookie, rated G, is much more than just a baseball film.It's about second chances in life, said the actor. Second chances in our dreams, second chances in our relationships in life and I think that's how somebody who is not even a baseball fan can relate to the film.Morris, who now works as a motivational speaker and volunteer baseball coach in Dallas, hopes that people everywhere can be inspired by his story.Baseball just happened to be my dream, said Morris. I think other people can put their dreams into my life because, let's face it, I'm just an ordinary person, I just got to do something that I wanted to do my entire life and I think other people can see themselves in that and see themselves accomplishing a lot.Ben Platt covers both Hollywood and the Dodgers for MLB.com.

They chose Quaid, who has played football stars in the films Everybody's All American and Any Given Sunday and has starred in several other had a string of both critical a commercial hits including Breaking Away, The Right Stuff and, more recently, Traffic.Quaid, who grew up in Houston and says that the old Colt 45's of Bob Aspromonte, Rusty Staub and Jimmy Wynn were his boyhood idols, had not picked up a baseball in nearly 30 years.I hadn't played baseball since I was in Little League, so it was quite a challenge, said Quaid. I was always a baseball fan, but I hadn't played in years. Getting the pitching motion down was the most important thing. I didn't want to look like I threw like an actress.So the producers hired former Dodger and Pirate reliever Jim Gott to work with Quaid.We had the luxury of three months before we started shooting, said Quaid. Jim would come over to my house and we'd throw balls in the front yard, we'd go over to Dodger Stadium once a week and throw over there. That was very exciting and we would just work at getting the pitching motion down.Gott says the 46-year-old actor was a very good student.We just went through the ritual of what a pitcher goes through, said Gott. An offseason training program is what I tried to work with him on. A throwing program of three to five days. Three days in the beginning. We just began to work on his mechanics. Dennis is an athlete already, I think he has more big league time with his football movies and now his baseball movie than I ever did in the big leagues. Here's a guy who's a huge star, who takes his craft seriously, but he loves the athletic side of things and he was able to adapt to whatever training program we had for him right off the bat.When he wasn't throwing, Gott had Quaid study videotape of a baseball legend.I gave Dennis a tape of Sandy Koufax pitching in the seventh game of the 1965 World Series against the Minnesota Twins, said Gott. I felt he should learn from the best and Sandy helped me a lot in my career with the Dodgers. Dennis was always looking for the finer points of what looked right and what seemed right. I felt being a lefty and playing a power pitcher like Jim Morris and Sandy being the best lefty power pitcher ever, that this is a tape he should see and he loved it.The entire process gave Quaid a deeper understanding of the game.I now have a better appreciation for pitchers, said Quaid. I've always been a baseball fan, but now I can watch a game with a little different point of view having delved just a little bit into Jim's world.Morris was impressed with Quaid's work as an actor and a pitcher.He threw everyday, said Morris. He got to the point as a pitcher, as pitchers do, before he let the ball go, he knew if the pitch was bad or not -- he was amazing. He did a lot of work.Morris is also pleased with the way his life is portrayed on film.I'm just so happy with the way it turned out, said Morris. I actually got to see a finished product about three weeks ago in Nashville with the religious broadcaster's convention and they didn't know I was in the theatre until it was over and I had to dry my eyes before I could get up and talk to them.Quaid says The Rookie, rated G, is much more than just a baseball film.It's about second chances in life, said the actor. Second chances in our dreams, second chances in our relationships in life and I think that's how somebody who is not even a baseball fan can relate to the film.Morris, who now works as a motivational speaker and volunteer baseball coach in Dallas, hopes that people everywhere can be inspired by his story.Baseball just happened to be my dream, said Morris. I think other people can put their dreams into my life because, let's face it, I'm just an ordinary person, I just got to do something that I wanted to do my entire life and I think other people can see themselves in that and see themselves accomplishing a lot.Ben Platt covers both Hollywood and the Dodgers for MLB.com.

Sounds like the kind of fantasy that Disney, the same studio that did the remake of Angels in the Outfield in 1994, would come up with.Well, the story does come to you courtesy of Disney, only this time the fantasy is reality. It is the true story of Jim Morris and his amazing odyssey from the faculty lounge to the Major Leagues in The Rookie.In the film, Dennis Quaid plays Morris, the former Major League prospect turned high school baseball coach in Big Lake, Texas, who in 1999 makes a deal with his players. If they win the divisional championship, he in return would try out for a Major League team. Of course, they win, forcing Morris to try out for the Devil Rays. And to the surprise of everyone, including himself, he ends up on the fast track to the big leagues with a consistent 98-mph fastball.I just found it inspirational, said Quaid. If it was a piece of fiction I don't think I would have done it. It's just too unbelievable. He was teaching high school science in May in some little town in Big Lake, Texas, and in September he's standing on the pitching mound in a Major League ballpark fulfilling his dream. You couldn't be more storybook about it.Morris, now 38, who retired from baseball after appearing in 16 games with the Devil Rays in 2000, says the events of 1999 changed the direction of his life.I think it opened my eyes to second chances, he said. I'm trying to teach my kids in high school a lesson and they end up teaching me a lesson and that in itself is a second chance. Kids see themselves helping an adult and I think that inspires them. I never would have tried to play baseball again if it weren't for them. I'd been out of the game for 10 1\/2 years.While pitching for the Devil Rays' Triple-A affiliate in Durham, NC, Morris got a call from Mark Ciardi, an aspiring film producer who happened to be a former teammate of Morris' when the two played together in the Milwaukee Brewers' farm system in the mid 1980s.

I thought everything about this film was above average, the story, the special effects, the acting, the directing...EVERYTHING!I thought the story was absolutely brilliant and quite inventive.  I really loved seeing the two captains fighting and working together.  Also, I love the idea of this place, The Nexus, a place where time has no meaning, you can relive all of your favorite memories and your dreams become a reality.  I thought the story was excellent.The special effects in this film were definitely above par!  There are several scenes that just made my jaw hit the floor because they looked so good and were done so well.  I've noticed a few people have complained that they used the exact same footage of the Klingon bird-of-prey exploding that was used in Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country, but I say if they're going to use some archive footage to save some money and put that money into the other special effects that they need for the movie, more power to them !  Besides, the scene is such a tiny scene in the movie and it wasn't the climax of the film anyway, so where's the problem?The acting and directing are top notch in this film.  I thought all of the actors did a fantastic job.  William Shatner pulls off a great performance in his final Star Trek film, as well as James Doohan and Walter Koenig.  The Next Generation cast does a great job as well, Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Michael Dorn, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Marina Sirtis, Gates McFadden and Whoopi Goldberg all pulled off great performances!  Malcolm McDowell did a fantastic job as the antagonist in this film!  I also really enjoyed seeing Alan Ruck and Jenette Goldstein in the film, although they both had very small roles.All in all, I thought this was a great addition to the Star Trek series and a great transition from the original Star Trek crew to the new Star Trek crew.  Also, I love this film because you need to know very little about the original Star Trek films to enjoy this film.  The only thing you need to know is that James T. Kirk (William Shatner) is the star of the original films and that Scotty (James Doohan) and Chekov (Walter Koenig) co-starred.  Also...it may be useful to know that Commander Sulu was another one of the original crew members (but not terribly important).  Anyhow, I would definitely recommend this film to any sci-fi fan and to anyone that likes the Star Trek films.  I hope you enjoy the film.

He seemed to 'just not be in the film anymore' he didn't get caught\/killed\/knocked out etc, etc. One minute he was in it as an evil henchman, and then we didn't see him again.Secondly, how did J and K know where to fly the Merc to? They had said earlier on that they had to find the launch site by a certain time, and then they seemed to go straight there without showing any signs of investigating it.Anyway, the larger roles for Frank and the Worm Guys was welcome and the above questions didn't spoil my enjoyment of a fairly average Saturday night out.

The plot was bland to non-existent, the action was so slow I almost fell asleep twice.  And who decided to cast the writer\/director\/producer as an actor - it must have been the same idiot who came up with this stupid movie in the first place.  I loved 'Sixth Sense', was so-so on 'Unbreakable' but I almost demanded my money back on this one (I wish someone had twisted my arm to make me see this one, then I'd have someone to blame other than myself)The end was so predictable that I fail to see how this can be categorized as either a mystery or a thriller.  For future reference, when the writer\/director\/producer casts himself in a movie to deliver the prophesy that he's going to the lake because the aliens must not like water, you can pretty much take his word for it - after all, he wrote the thing, he should know.

A teriffic example of a great horro\/action movie is aliens, which seems to be what Starship Troopers ripped off.The biggest let dow was the portrayal of the Federation and the Mobile Infantry. THEY WERE A JOKE!!! We saw a bunch of kids running around with assault rifles that they didnt know how to use. Teenage girls losing it and running away, only to fall through the ground. The acting was only so-so, as Casper Van Dian isn't Oscar worthy. My personal favorite was Michael Ironside, who did as much as he can with his role. The dialouge was rather lame, as it seemed to be that of a kids movie.Several seems are blatantly ripped off of aliens. A few examples are the trooper who runs up the hill yelling to the bugs Come on! Come on you bastards! Sound familiar?? Bill Paxton's exact lines, except in Aliens he was worth watching in a teriffic scene. Another is that same troopers yell as they deploy from their carrier. A complete rip! it would be have decent if i weren't laughing. The final downfall is the attempt at human heroism. The movie portrays kids trying to be heroes, and doesn't do a very good job at it at all.All in all, Starship Troopers was a fun action flick to see, but i debate whether or not it was worth the 6.50$. It was overall a big disappointment in the acting, dialouge, and script. If you have some free time, then rent it. But don't expect a classic.
