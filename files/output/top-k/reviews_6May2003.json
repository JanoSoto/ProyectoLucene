As an avid D&D player and fan, I took great offence. I thought it was the typical case of highbrow, arty-farty movie reviewers who hate everything that isn't a foreign art film not being able to appreciate a fantasy movie. And then I saw it. Every poor review had been correct - in fact, they had been downright generous. This film was destined to be an underground cult movie for D&D fans, but instead of writing it as such, it was written to have a broader appeal. It fails on all counts. The storyline was pathetic (an episode of Hercules or Xena would have more twists and nuances), all of the characters are just plain awful - with no personality or depth whatsoever, and even the special effects are terrible. The performance of Justin Whalin as Ridley Freeborn is especially painful. Even Thora Birch (whom I adore) delivers a poor performance; but then again, she isn't given much to work with. On a more geeky level, this movie didn't even resemble D&D (the role-playing game), it was just a generic fantasy film. Nothing which makes the game unique was faithfully represented in this movie. The scenes at the tavern and the thieves guild looked more like the Cantina scene from Star Wars than a glimpse into the established fantasy realms of D&D. If it didn't bear the name Dungeons & Dragons, and was released back in the same era that spawned such campy classics as Beastmaster, Sword and the Sorceror, and Hawk the Slayer, then I might have enjoyed it as a bit of harmless fluff. But to be the end result of the long awaited movie adaptation of the role-playing game, it failed miserably. The team that inflicted this monstrosity upon us should look to movies like Willow, Dragonslayer and Lord of the Rings, and then hang their heads in shame. I can't recommend this film on any level, except possibly as a kids movie, and even then I could think of about 100 better movies to recommend for children.

It's not quite surreal or full of quirky nonsense, it's more like a set of events, which seem to make sense on one level, no sense on another level, and finally perfect sense on another level.  The movie acts as an illusion to what's really going on, its almost pleasantly distracting.Our main character, Donnie Darko, is a boy suffering from sleep walking, and now what appears to be delusions.  He manages to avoid a certain death with the aid of a man in a bunny suit.  This twisted bunny also informs Donnie that the world will come to an end within the month.  This sparked curiosity and dread in Donnie, who also has every other aspect of a teenager's life to worry about.

Very few other actors could have pulled this off. 10\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"6 May 2003","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  In 1952 Argentina went through a period of mourning for the passing of actress and one-time working class girl Eva Perón nee Duarte.

Watched it on TV last night and was able to maybe view it more fairly without the hype and the feeling the loud music gives.  It is a good film generally and it's main weakness is that it was written for the stage.  The plot is good and is very clear about Eva's climb to the top &#150; the song where Eva goes through lovers like toilet paper is very funny and full of mock sincerity.  My favourite line in the film comes where Eva is touring Europe and complains of the crowd chanting whore at her `it's an easy mistake to make' says her host `I still get called General even though I withdrew from the military years ago' &#150; ie he comforts her by saying that she was a whore once!This is probably the element of the story that attracted Parker and Stone and it is what makes the film so very interesting - this is not propaganda.  However the film goes on too long and the middle quarter begins to drag a little &#150; this could easily have lost 20 minutes.  What exasperates this situation is the way that the music repeats the same songs several times (albeit in different ways).  This makes it feel a little repetitive &#150; even if you like the songs (as I did). Because the songs generally have instrumental sections the film suffers.  In these sections we have crowd shots or actions shots of some sort.  What we don't have is choreographed numbers than are the norm in a musical, to me this was a bit of a loss as the film tries to stay as a film with songs as opposed to a musical.  Having said that, Parker does direct well and most of the scenes are lavish and well worked.The cast is strong and surprisingly good.  Given Madonna's reputation as an actress in the press, this stands out as one of her better roles &#150; mainly because it requires her to do her day job of singing.  She doesn't manage to make Eva totally sympathetic in that her death bed cries don't sound any different to her hollow cries made while climbing the social ladder but apart from that she is good and brings out the harder edge to her well.  Banderas is only the narrator and not part of the film but for the first hour he is the driving force for the film, and his reduced use in the second half is a loss.  He is funny and his physical actions really add to his lines.  Pryce is surprisingly good as Perón and has a measured voice on him.  Of the support everyone does well and over-acts in a stage way (the opening grief in the cinema is a good example of what I mean).  One that stood out was Jimmy Nail &#150; but only because I kept laughing imagining him breaking into Crocodile Shoes or hearing him sing `she's lying' at the end of every line!Despite the fact that this suffers from being a musical that tries to exist as a `proper' film it has good music (if a little repetitive) and enough comment in the plot to hold the interest.  Ideally it could have lost 20 minutes to be a slimmer, less weighty beast but it is an enjoyable film none the less &#150; this from a man who isn't too keen on musicals generally.

Also, a lot of people I know who have seen it have an opinion about it and appeared to be one of those love it or hate it films which intrigue me even more.  Interestingly enough, the main praise I have heard is that it is a movie that makes you really think, which is the biggest complaint I've heard about it as well. **Possible spoiler if you don't read the back of the VHS or DVD, I believe**Donnie Darko stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Darko, a suburban teen who is emotionally and mentally disturbed.  By day, he lives a quasi-functional existence, but generally at night, he is visited by a nightmarish rabbit with a scary skull head who tells him to go out and perform destructive acts.  Why would Donnie do this?  Because on October 2, 1988, Donnie is beckoned outside by Frank the rabbit, just in time to avoid the plane engine that comes crashing through Donnie's bedroom.  Therefore, Donnie feels indebted to Frank, who tells him that in 28 days, the world will end.  The film then follows the next 28 days of Donnie's life.I was enjoyed this film for so many reasons. One primary draw is a great character, and Donnie Darko is definitely an incredibly multi-dimensional character.  I was so thrilled to see a figure who is conflicted, eccentric and disturbed, yet incredibly intelligent.  His continual questioning of authority because of his expansive way of thinking is extremely refreshing because so many times we see films where youths question the status quo but don't have the bones to back it up.  Along with the main character, there is an impressive supporting cast - most notably Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mom and (words I never thought I would utter) a small but effective performance by Patrick Swayze as a local self-help guru.  I have to make a special mention for Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Darko.  I had never seen him in a film before this week, and I have now seen him in two, this one and The Good Girl.  I am really looking forward to watching the progression of his career and to see what types of roles he takes in the future because he is extremely talented.  He seems to bring a very believable soulfulness, maturity and intelligence to his roles which was personified in this film. Films that leave many aspects of the plot open for interpretation is another genre that I am attracted to, and this film does just that.  The director, Richard Kelly is still young and has the potential for having a very interesting career if this movie is any indication.  His style is a mixture of two of my favorite directors, Paul Thomas Anderson and David Lynch, a very attractive combination.  Like PT Anderson he has rich character studies and uses the soundtrack in an extremely effective manner.  I absolutely loved the 80's new wave soundtrack, because you absolutely believe that those songs would be on a mix tape Donnie would put together.  And like Lynch, he explores dark elements to every day life and isn't afraid to insert bizarre characters into his vision.  (Hence Frank the rabbit who, and maybe I missed something if he was supposed to be funny, didn't make me laugh once - I actually took him very seriously and was a little frightened by him).One wouldn't expect to find any humor in a movie that explores mental illness, an impending apocalypse and even the existence of God, but I did laugh a few times.  Most of the laughs were at Jim Cunningham's (Patrick Swayze) expense, and were usually extremely subtle which is again extremely refreshing.Don't bother with this film if you are not interested in suspending disbelief for two hours, and don't even attempt it if you like your stories handed to you on a silver platter, with beginning middle and end explained complete with charts and diagrams.  If you are interested in cinema that takes chances and is going to make you think about it for hours, possibly days after then check this film out immediately because it is outstanding.--Shelly ","genre":null},{"date":"6 May 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Donnie Darko is a film I've been meaning to watch for about a year now, since it has become something of a cult film.
