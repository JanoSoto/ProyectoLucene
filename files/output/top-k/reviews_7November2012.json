Many would say a great film&#x97;in other words, art&#x97;is not necessarily an entertainment piece, but a movie which makes comments about life and pushes the audience to do some thinking even when the screening has ended. Personally, I've never stood with the idea that all great films are merely absorbing and never entertaining. That silly idea that films are intellectual stimulants and movies are just trash pumped up in a way that comes across as giddy. Although I do agree that many great films probe the audience to think, one of my solutions is this when I finish the screening, I sit there afterward and tell myself that there was nothing else I would have rather done in those two hours. That sensation swelled me when I finished watching Double Indemnity for the first time about a year ago, and it has returned with me every time I have seen it since.This marvelous film-noir, directed by Billy Wilder, shoves a dagger into the idea that art cannot be entertaining, only observable. Now Double Indemnity does not make its central plot&#x97;a salesman co-opting with an unhappy housewife to murder her husband for a $100,000 insurance clause&#x97;into something exciting&#x97;something people might want to try out at home. In fact, as the movie progresses toward its third act and the two murderers start to lose their grip on what's happening, it poignantly resolves the seemingly tired idea that crime doesn't pay. But there is a certain level of joy to be had from this film. Most of it comes from the brilliant performance of Edward G. Robinson as a comically brilliant claims manager on to the big scheme, and the rest of it comes from the way director Billy Wilder brings tremendous energy out of a leisurely paced story.As much as I've enjoyed his lighthearted performances, I had always felt that Fred MacMurray was capable of putting darker edges on himself. Double Indemnity does not give him the coldblooded meanness I always felt he could play effectively, but it brings him somewhat close to that level. A man who is more clever and intelligent than he appears (not just a dumb salesman, although he does allow femme fatale Barbara Stanwyck to manipulate him), not afraid to undergo any task he puts before himself. But what is also brilliant about MacMurray's performance is the way he gets us the care. That is tricky. The character is a murderer; he planned it out; he arranged it. The movie does not condone his crime, even though his victim is hardly the world's nicest guy. And yet the audience follows MacMurray's story with a certain affection for him, and by the end, much to our shock, we actually sort of wish that he might be allowed to dodge the authorities. Or at least escape the gas chamber. The screenplay by Billy Wilder and novelist Raymond Chandler provides the motivation, the dialogue, and the drama, but MacMurray rounds it off with an easygoing, effortless shine of a performance. I do not know of Fred MacMurray was the sort of actor who took methods and concentration to a deep level, but he was one of those talents who made good acting look easy.I give MacMurray special attention, for I feel even the film's greatest admirers have more or less taken his work for granted. I do not by any mean wish to demean Barbara Stanywck's performance. She, too, is excellent. I'll go even further and say this is one of the best villains ever put on-screen. At one point, she looks up at MacMurray, we see the white in her eyes as she smiles, and shivers always run down my spine. I do not begrudge her, it is just that everybody mentions her character first of all when discussing the acting of Double Indemnity. The movie's got three great performances, and the third goes to Edward G. Robinson, once again, as that eccentric claims manager. Robinson provides most of the movie's bits of comic relief, such as when he stands up to his own boss during a claims dispute, sides with the victim, and goes on a rant about six volumes of suicide and suicide by poisons, subdivided by types of poison and so forth. Robinson is the straight-shooter of the story, and his dynamic with the MacMurray character is a very fascinating sort of friendship. MacMurray even says I love you, too. Today, we might take that as some sort of homoerotic subtext. Ignoring the fact that that was utterly forbidden in 1944 films, Double Indemnity plays it as a strong friendship. So as the movie progresses, the audience again starts to feel empathy, this time for how Robinson might react when he finds out his best salesman is a murderer.Double Indemnity has all the makings of a great film. The photography is rich and wonderful (the Venetian blinds are used at their ultimate here), and Miklos Rozsa's string-dominate music score is more than something that just plays in the background like an out-of-tune jukebox. The film has a snappy motif theme that repeats at just the right moments and never wears out its welcome. And Billy Wilder, the director, always finds the right decisions on how to shoot a scene and when. When to keep his camera locked for a long stretch of time and when to cut away.

So there are chances that Randa Haines' film doesn't meet your expectations, and I mean that in a positive way. I, myself, didn't know exactly what the film was about; it could be as much about a priest, or a missionary working in an orphan, but the story surprised me, in a very pleasant way.For all I knew, the film starred William Hurt and his then-girlfriend, the actress Marlee Matlin. As a good movie geek, I knew she won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance, but it didn't leave many indications about the role she played, except the most crucial one being a deaf actress, she could only play a character suffering from this handicap. Given that, while I was watching the opening sequence, William Hurt as James Leeds, a newly hired speech teacher for the deaf and his first class, I could see coming the inspirational film about the teacher with unconventional methods. Leeds was teaching a group of young teenagers not to rely too much on signing, but instead to learn about lip-reading and the pronunciation of basic sounds in order to face some real-life situations. Some of them are very receptive and seem to learn quickly, maybe too quickly, but in a way, it states that there are various degrees of deafness, there are two other pupils suffering from severer cases who don't participate.Later, Leeds encounters Sarah Norman, a young woman who preferred to stay at the school. She was there since the age of seven, when her parents put her, thinking she was retarded. Sarah is not just beautiful, looking at the way she signs; it's obvious that she has quite a temper, a personality that doesn't leave Leeds indifferent. He'll learn that she never talked and doesn't intend to. At that moment, we're left with the perfect ingredients of a teacher movie and the story of someone who overcomes a handicap to face the adversity of life and all that stuff. Leeds would teach Sarah to speak, to communicate like the other pupils. She refuses, he insists, but when she refuses again, he gives up, and that's a clever twist. The film uses predictable material but magnificently transcends it by delivering something deeper and more emotionally challenging. Leeds is not interested in Sarah because he wants to help her, but because he is in love with her, and Children of a Lesser God unveils its core it's a romance, and quite a beautiful one. Yet the film never exploits the romance to ignore Sarah's deafness, which would be unrealistic but also impossible because the sign language is omnipresent. However, it can be debated whether it's fitting or realistic that Leeds translates into words everything she says. The script provides a reasonable answer during a restaurant sequence when Leeds says he likes to hear himself talk. I take it as a satisfying answer because I can believe a man who'd deal with deaf people on a daily basis would love to inhabit his place with his own voice, it might also reveal a sort of egoistical side behind his altruistic nature, but I think it fits the character, slightly pompous at times. But I also accept the criticism about the film being sometimes too noisy for a story about the deaf, while it could have been an opportunity to plunge in this world of silence. The film can be criticized for only adapting usual romantic situations to one handicap, but that criticism, in my opinion, is invalidated by the basis of Leeds and Sarah's relationship.Yes, the film was more about Leeds helping Sarah to penetrate his world, while Sarah's anger and torment, and this was magnificently portrayed by Marlee Matlin, was to convince people, much more the man she loves, to stop seeing her as a case to study or someone to help. As long as she's perceived as a deaf woman, she stops being herself in the sense that she's only seen through the perceptions of other people, not her perception. But what I love about Leeds' character is the way he reacts, he's not moved by this speech, he doesn't fall into the convenient trap of sentimentality and pretend that Sarah doesn't have a handicap. In the pivotal scene, when she's invited to a reunion of deaf people, Leeds is uncomfortable, and so are we. He's not denying the positive and cathartic aspect of such reunions, but he'd never adopt silence as a referential state because he loves Sarah. On the contrary, it's because he loves her that he tells her the truth, and refuses to let her drown in her existential torment.Sarah is far from the noble victim and Leeds is not the good Samaritan either, here is a stubborn woman who refuses to play Leeds' game and here's a man who can't lie to himself, he considers deafness as a handicap for communication, for confrontation and for such trivial things as listening to music. One of his biggest goals is to make his pupils enjoy and feel the music, and his incapability to 'show the music' to Sarah betrays a huge desperation is his heart. Children of a Lesser God centers on a remarkable couple, full of anger and passion, challenging every single cinematic stereotype. At one crucial scene, they have an argument and suddenly, Sarah is so turned she wants to make love. The script remarkably challenges all the expectations even in the smallest details, dealing with deafness with less condescending sentimentality than other movies would.Some would say that subtitles would have been more useful than words.

So there are chances that Randa Haines' film doesn't meet your expectations, and I mean that in a positive way. I, myself, didn't know exactly what the film was about; it could be as much about a priest, or a missionary working in an orphan, but the story surprised me, in a very pleasant way.For all I knew, the film starred William Hurt and his then-girlfriend, the actress Marlee Matlin. As a good movie geek, I knew she won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance, but it didn't leave many indications about the role she played, except the most crucial one being a deaf actress, she could only play a character suffering from this handicap. Given that, while I was watching the opening sequence, William Hurt as James Leeds, a newly hired speech teacher for the deaf and his first class, I could see coming the inspirational film about the teacher with unconventional methods. Leeds was teaching a group of young teenagers not to rely too much on signing, but instead to learn about lip-reading and the pronunciation of basic sounds in order to face some real-life situations. Some of them are very receptive and seem to learn quickly, maybe too quickly, but in a way, it states that there are various degrees of deafness, there are two other pupils suffering from severer cases who don't participate.Later, Leeds encounters Sarah Norman, a young woman who preferred to stay at the school. She was there since the age of seven, when her parents put her, thinking she was retarded. Sarah is not just beautiful, looking at the way she signs; it's obvious that she has quite a temper, a personality that doesn't leave Leeds indifferent. He'll learn that she never talked and doesn't intend to. At that moment, we're left with the perfect ingredients of a teacher movie and the story of someone who overcomes a handicap to face the adversity of life and all that stuff. Leeds would teach Sarah to speak, to communicate like the other pupils. She refuses, he insists, but when she refuses again, he gives up, and that's a clever twist. The film uses predictable material but magnificently transcends it by delivering something deeper and more emotionally challenging. Leeds is not interested in Sarah because he wants to help her, but because he is in love with her, and Children of a Lesser God unveils its core it's a romance, and quite a beautiful one. Yet the film never exploits the romance to ignore Sarah's deafness, which would be unrealistic but also impossible because the sign language is omnipresent. However, it can be debated whether it's fitting or realistic that Leeds translates into words everything she says. The script provides a reasonable answer during a restaurant sequence when Leeds says he likes to hear himself talk. I take it as a satisfying answer because I can believe a man who'd deal with deaf people on a daily basis would love to inhabit his place with his own voice, it might also reveal a sort of egoistical side behind his altruistic nature, but I think it fits the character, slightly pompous at times. But I also accept the criticism about the film being sometimes too noisy for a story about the deaf, while it could have been an opportunity to plunge in this world of silence. The film can be criticized for only adapting usual romantic situations to one handicap, but that criticism, in my opinion, is invalidated by the basis of Leeds and Sarah's relationship.Yes, the film was more about Leeds helping Sarah to penetrate his world, while Sarah's anger and torment, and this was magnificently portrayed by Marlee Matlin, was to convince people, much more the man she loves, to stop seeing her as a case to study or someone to help. As long as she's perceived as a deaf woman, she stops being herself in the sense that she's only seen through the perceptions of other people, not her perception. But what I love about Leeds' character is the way he reacts, he's not moved by this speech, he doesn't fall into the convenient trap of sentimentality and pretend that Sarah doesn't have a handicap. In the pivotal scene, when she's invited to a reunion of deaf people, Leeds is uncomfortable, and so are we. He's not denying the positive and cathartic aspect of such reunions, but he'd never adopt silence as a referential state because he loves Sarah. On the contrary, it's because he loves her that he tells her the truth, and refuses to let her drown in her existential torment.Sarah is far from the noble victim and Leeds is not the good Samaritan either, here is a stubborn woman who refuses to play Leeds' game and here's a man who can't lie to himself, he considers deafness as a handicap for communication, for confrontation and for such trivial things as listening to music. One of his biggest goals is to make his pupils enjoy and feel the music, and his incapability to 'show the music' to Sarah betrays a huge desperation is his heart. Children of a Lesser God centers on a remarkable couple, full of anger and passion, challenging every single cinematic stereotype. At one crucial scene, they have an argument and suddenly, Sarah is so turned she wants to make love. The script remarkably challenges all the expectations even in the smallest details, dealing with deafness with less condescending sentimentality than other movies would.Some would say that subtitles would have been more useful than words. Maybe it would have made the climactic moment more impacting, but I guess the film could grab more audience this way, I wouldn't blame it for that, especially when it has such a thought-provoking script and profound romance to give us.

Hence why the movie's two high points, fatally placed at opposite ends of each other, do ring so powerfully, and unsuccessfully coerced me into forgiving the utter boredom that I suffered through in the middle. Spielberg's hand is present in the second Indiana Jones film, but his heart is missing.The movie gets off on the wrong foot very early on, after a rousing and clever opening sequence set in Shanghai.

Shootouts in big fancy casinos, with MacGuffins from opposite parties being exchanged via a turning table for drinks. Bad guys trapping our hero over a chasm, leaving him no choice but to cut the rope and take whatever chance he has left.

And although I do compliment Spielberg for delivering the movie's best moments, I also shell him some blame for accepting the screenplay handed to him. One of the best things about Raiders of the Lost Ark was that both Spielberg and the screenplay had the same goal. Here, they split paths. The director wanted to continue the tradition of the Republic serials; the screenwriters wanted to make a dopey mishmash of kiddy comedy and gruesome terror. Everything that takes place inside the titular temple plays against each other. It includes scenes where Kate Capshaw is served movie-Indian food (in other words, grotesque bugs that are still living) and she attempts not to gag and is then contrasted with voodoo sacrifices, where the victim's heart is, right before our eyes, ripped out, and the body is thrown into a pit of magma. The screenplay handles these negatively conflicting attitudes with no discipline, resulting in a frantic, schizophrenic demeanor.Is it not a coincidence that the two people who wrote Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, would, two years later, write the screenplay for another unpleasantly mean-spirited movie that would attempt to ram kid comedy with grotesque horror together? The hinted-at catastrophe Howard the Duck. That is where Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom goes so wrong the unwillingness of the screenwriters to pick a mood and go with it. Harrison Ford is his usual charming self as the titular adventurer, but he's got nobody interesting to tag along with him. And in a movie like this, the hero can only be about as interesting as the adventure he is given to undertake. Dodging the Nazis while searching for religious artifacts worked before and after this movie, but running from voodoo practitioners and being hypnotized into nearly through a comrade into the core of the earth is not what I had in mind for an Indiana Jones adventure. The villains are memorable, but for all the wrong reasons. And his sidekicks are utterly obnoxious. It is hard to tell from this movie that Kate Capshaw is a talented actress. Her squealing and whining goes a long way and really fast. And it is no big wonder why Jonathan Ka Quan, as the little kid, never had a kickoff career. Yes, he was just a kid when making this picture, but there is none of that real spark the audience looks for in a character we're meant to root for.I wanted more of the traditional stuff when the movie goes into the temple. More booby traps, more trying to figure out how to escape, more fights where the hero has to worry more about being shot or impaled as opposed to being burned alive (because the former can be dealt with in a way that is not unpleasantly gruesome in a movie meant to be joyously enjoyable), and a lot less of the mean-spirited material we get in this installment of the series.

Love's Labour's Lost was not as bad as I'd heard, but I can actually understand the criticisms as while it does have its charms it is a heavily flawed film. The play is one of Shakespeare's weakest due to how overly-wordy it is, so I knew that when I heard about this film that it can go either way. I will start off by saying that Branagh does deserve credit for trying to make Shakespeare's work accessible to wider audiences, but it uncharacteristically came in mixed results here. I often praise Branagh for his respect and understanding for Shakespeare, but his other films especially Much Ado Nothing, Hamlet and Henry V did this much better. Other than the title and some of the dialogue, which is not the most poetic and witty Shakespeare has done but has evidence of both, there's not really enough that of that Shakespeare feel. That is largely because while making a noble attempt to make the play accessible Branagh oversimplifies the writing and consequently loses the story's consequently making it here thin and too much of an excuse to string song-and-dance numbers one or another.Another consequence is that as a directing job it is on the unimaginative side and feels like too much West End not enough Branagh. There are also two miscasts. Matthew Lillard is a tall, handsome and likable guy, but here he constantly sounds and looks like he's got something up his nose. Even more problematic is Alicia Silverstone, who I liked in Clueless, but I thought she was pretty awful here both as a singer-dancer and as a Shakespearean actor, she can barely sing a note without being breathy and out of tune and is often behind the beat in the singing, and in terms of acting her delivery is always forced and awkward especially in the darker shift of tone. Finally, I usually like Timothy Spall a lot but his I Get a Kick Out of You was for me an embarrassment.On the plus side, the 30s setting is evoked absolutely beautifully, and it is well filmed too. The songs from the likes of Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Irving Berlin are outstanding, and the dancing sequences in the film do have a lot of charm and pizazz, especially Let's Face the Music and Dance, There's No Business Like Show Business and They Can't Take That Away from Me. Even though the singing is not exactly great, it isn't entirely awful, the best voice of the entire cast easily comes from Carmen Ejogo. The characters are not that developed, due to the oversimplifications but do have a lot of easy-going charm and likability that I can't hate them. Some members of the cast, namely Branagh, Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan do show an understanding of Shakespeare, how it should sound and feel. I did like most of the performances. Branagh is not entirely convincing age-wise but is enthusiastic at least in his role. Briers and McEwan are splendid, while Nathan Lane is hilarious. I especially loved Natascha McElhone and Adrian Lester. McElhone plays her role with such beauty and depth, and Lester is sublime in his equally sublime musical set piece.All in all, has its charms but for me it is not one Branagh's finest hours. 6\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"7 November 2012","score":"","review":" I love Shakespeare and musicals, and I have a great respect for Kenneth Branagh.

In this movie Stephen King actually does try to do something original, in that he creates a race of supernatural beings who for some unknown reason call themselves sleepwalkers. These beings are psychic vampires (meaning they feed off of psychic energy as opposed to blood) who can transform themselves into bipedal were-cats. In addition, they also possess powers of telekinesis and invisibility, which makes things more interesting. This film follows two of these creatures, Charles and his mother, Mary, who are forced to live nomadic lifestyles because it turns out that regular house cats are deadly to them and always seem to find them in their new neighborhoods. Another constraint is that they can only feed off of the life force of young, female virgins such as young Tanya Robertson, who Twin Peaks fans will recognize as Madchen Amick. She happens to meet Charles in her creative writing class, thinking that he's falling in love with her; little does she know that Charles (played decently by Brian Krause) wants to suck the life out of her. All the actors play their parts well, however the real star of the movie is the talented Alice Krige, who plays the deliciously evil matriarch who will do anything to protect her son. A number of people have expressed dismay over the film and there is some truth in that the direction by Mick Garris does not always flow right, the early CGI effects, although not terrible, seem a little dated today, and a few plot holes are present, such as what is it about cats that make them so deadly to sleepwalkers? Still, the movie never drags, the physical makeup they used for the creatures was very convincing and probably more so than some of the effects you see today, and the creatures are a pretty cool idea. One other thing that adds to the movie is the theme song, done by Enya, I think, that manages to be both beautiful and haunting. I'll admit that I'm a little biased in that I love just about anything from the 90s. Yet, give Sleepwalkers a chance. Besides, there are worse Stephen King Movies out there; just watch Rose Red' and you'll see what I mean. 7 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 November 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" While I can't say that Stephen King's Sleepwalkers is a great film, it certainly is not the worst one either.

Undeniably, several scenes, situations, and dialog are present here that I am sure have been copied endlessly - a mark of a true classic. John Williams' theme is grand and memorable. Yet there are elements in the film I wish were polished further.One is the utter unrealistic nature of the Stormtroopers' shooting. Obi-Wan's comment about their shots being precise made me roll my eyes. Never was it more demonstrated as Leia and Luke were trapped on the tiny dangling platform. Their military performance was horrendous. I understand how bad guys' aims are usually off - but Stormtroopers bring this to a whole new level of bad. I never felt a sense of danger even when faced against an battalion of those soldiers.Second is the battle and death of Obi-Wan. Their sword\/saber-fighting was extremely stiff and boring. It literally felt like an old man swinging his cane. And Vader sure felt epic - but it didn't show in what was a prime opportunity. How unfortunate. Moreoever Obi-Wan's death, while honorable, was unnecessary and badly timed. He could have sacrificed himself when the survivors boarded the ship already, not when they were standing in plain view. But then, given number 1, I'm sure it wasn't much of a problem.Finally, the characters were absolutely bland. They were cardboard characters with a single attribute.

God, that sounds corny (after a pause) Why do you make me feel like Jane in a Tarzan comic? This is Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) relieved when Mick Dundee (Paul Hogan) got rid of three thugs after showing them what a real knife is. The line stops being corny when she admits it and unveils a subtle intelligence within the story, as if by comparing the hero to a movie icon, it makes him ordinary within the film, while indirectly establishing his extraordinary status as a movie character. I read that Crocodile Dundee was a surprise hit at the time of its release, being the second highest-grossing film of 1986 after Top Gun. Actually, I'm more surprised that critics were surprised because Crocodile Dundee is precisely the kind of creations that made the 80's such a great decade on the field of fun, sheer escapism and movie heroes. And Dundee is as cool, brave, macho and bad-ass as Indiana Jones, Conan or Rambo, but for a change, he doesn't kill people, and he's far more sympathetic and likable than any of them. I say 'likable' because there must be a reason why a film with no stars and made by an unknown director would meet such a big success. Apart from word of mouth, I can't figure.Although the word is hackneyed, the crocodile hunter is as iconic as Indiana Jones himself, immediately recognizable from his black hat with gator teeth, his vest, his brown leather jacket, his Aussie accent and a hidden scratch in his leg he cutely calls a 'love bite'. The 'love bite' has been exaggerated into a bitten-off leg on its way to New York, but it decided Sue Charlton to go to Australia and interview the mysterious legend, a legend even more embellished by Mick's friend Walter. In a pub, Dundee makes a spectacular entrance and reveals beneath his toughness a very down-to-earth personality and an irresistible sense of humor. Creating an unforgettable character is not an easy task, yet Crocodile Dundee does and that's a credit to Paul Hogan's fine performance, rightfully earning him the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Comedy.Linda Kozlowski was also nominated as she plays her part perfectly. She's the audience that is invited to discover Mick's world with the nosiness and curiosity we expect from a female journalist (that's Dundee talking). And the exchanges between Mick and Sue reveal a subtler writing than in any other comedy or romance, when she mentions that the Aborigines own the land, you could tell it's an overly reverent statement but Mick corrects her immediately arguing over who owns them is like two fleas arguing over who owns the dog they live on., no room from predictable lines Mick's age? The last time he asked when he was born, the Aborigine who raised him said in summertime. When Walter informs them he'll be back in Wednesday, Mick nods but after a pause, has to ask what today is. As Walter comments Doesn't know. Doesn't care.And during the two-night trip, Sue, the 'sheila' discovers this world where the notion of time and property cease to exist. Whatever 'sheila' means woman or foreigner, she's clearly an outsider and the script tactfully avoids the cliché of the feminist urban female, Kowzlowki plays her character very naturally, she doesn't get offended by Dundee's macho comments, she knows where her place is and she doesn't even save Mick or flirt with danger to prove something. This is crucial because it also helps to create a natural bonding process with a realism that is almost equal to Meryl Streep and Robert Redford in Out of Africa. And the film uses humor as the perfect language to highlight the growing complicity. For example, he cooks her some snakes and disgusting animals, she tries to eat them while he casually opens a corned-beef can. Humor is not just granted because it's a comedy; it's a real side of Mick's personality and his most endearing charm. And it is pivotal for the plot because it leads to what everybody expects the invitation. This is when Crocodile Dundee works like the missing link between Harrison Ford in Raiders of the Lost Ark and Eddie Murphy in Coming to America, a film it probably inspired. Dundee is still exotic enough to feel like a fish out the water when he's coming to America and provide a funny view of New York City from a foreigner's perspective, pinnacling with the famous 'knife' scene. It probably deals with more formulaic situations than the first act. We're not that thrilled by Linda's pompous fiancé, who naturally is totally different from Mick, but it's Mick Dundee we follow with an interested eye, evolving in an urban jungle full of prostitutes, junkies, and transvestites. The film doesn't sugarcoat the reality (hence the unforgettable shot on Sue's swimsuit) but it's faithful to Dundee's adventurous and friendly nature. I doubt he would have enjoyed staying in the hotel and watch I Love Lucy. The formula of the second act is redeemed by the way it's handled until the unforgettable climactic scene. But what the film succeeds is to create a defining character of the 80's, a sympathetic macho icon who, for once, doesn't kill and doesn't take himself seriously, and a great script, rightfully Oscar-nominated. I know I mentioned the script several times, but that's because many directors would take the premise for granted and forget about the writing. The French tried to make their version through the infamous Little Indian, Big City and although a commercial success, the film was a disaster. The story was going from archetypal situations to convenient resolutions with no heart, no wit, no characterization, no charm whatsoever.One must endure this horrific film to realize why Crocodile Dundee is so great, believe me, mate!

His performance is utterly devoid of any passion or even discernible attraction to the young Audrey Hepburn, plus for once his solo dance routines seem just that, routine and while still danced consummately, somehow lacking in dynamism or invention.Hepburn gets a dream ticket herself, decked out in a succession of high-fashion costumes and even getting to sing and dance with the great man, without ever convincing the viewer that she's a natural in either discipline.

Yes it's the old why-would-she-fall-for-him conundrum that not unnaturally bedevilled the ageing Astaire's later films, but it's exaggerated even more here when contrasted with the ever-youthful looking Hepburn. The plot seeks to cash in and poke fun at Paris's post-war reputation for fashion and philosophy and certainly the settings, particularly the exteriors are luminously warm, but the humour is forced at best and lacking finesse.

A local hunter takes a disliking to the husband (Jake Weber) while the couple's son becomes increasingly concerned about their environment and a Native American legend -- the Wendigo, an angry spirit that can manifest as man, beast, tree or wind.Wendigo is not a conventional creature feature so if you're looking for a typical monster flick look elsewhere. The movie has a slow build-up filled with mundane drama, which some have criticized. Yet this is reminiscent of films like The Birds, where the main characters and a sense of realism are well established before things get going.Wendigo is a mood piece more than anything else. The mysteriousness of the lonely Catskill woods is evoked along with a sense of wonder and fear of the unknown. It's a vibe more akin to The Mothman Prophecies than Ogre. Like The Mothman Prophecies Wendigo is somehow a pleasure just to watch (as long as you're not psyched-up for a monster-slasher flick). There's a quiet style and expertise to the filmmaking that smacks of professionalism.Patricia Clarkson is effective as the wife\/mother and little Erik Per Sullivan is excellent as the son, Miles.Interestingly, none of the special effects were done with CGI, but rather cinematic techniques, costumes, make-up and creative editing. It works for me.The film leaves the viewer somewhat scratching his\/her head with its ambiguity. What conjured up the Wendigo? What's its purpose? How exactly does it devour people with its unquenchable hunger? Etc. Obviously if you like everything spelled out for you and don't like banging your head this is not the film for you.The film was shot in the Catskills, NY, and runs 91 minutes.GRADE B+ or A- POSSIBLE EXPLANATION (***SPOILER*** Don't read further if you haven't seen the film) Children are more sensitive to the spiritual realm because they haven't yet built up years of intellectual blockades along with social conditioning. It's clear that Miles senses malevolent creatures or spirits around him, which is why he and his mother check the closet and underneath the bed before he goes to sleep.The Wendigo is a spirit and can only manifest in the physical realm through an agent who releases the spirit through BELIEF. The Wendigo souvenir plays a role in the Wendigo's manifestation because it was created by someone who BELIEVED in the Wendigo; it's in essence an article of worship and, in a sense, an idol. Hence, the Wendigo is attracted to the figure, which can inspire BELIEF in certain individuals, like Miles.The ghostly Native American in the souvenir shop is obviously the Wendigo in human form. He's attracted to Miles because he senses belief and therefore guides the boy to the Wendigo figure and explains the legend. He says, No one believes in spirits anymore, but after sharing the story of the Wendigo he asks the boy if he believes, to which Miles responds, I guess so. This wasn't much, but it was all the Wendigo needed. The boy gets his mother to purchase the statue and thus the Wendigo is released into the physical realm to devour human prey.The Wendigo is an evil spirit and therefore a liar. In Indian form he claims that such spirits are not bad just angry. In other words, he makes excuses for his malevolent actions. Our prisons are full of people who do the same thing.Once released, the Wendigo immediately inspires Otis to shoot the husband and, later, kill the cop. The Wendigo then goes after the very person he used, Otis, which shows that evil spirits will readily use you if you're willing and then lose you. Why didn't the Wendigo provoke someone else? Because evil spirits can only utilize those who are ALREADY given over to the dark side of their natures. The film shows that Otis was already an arrogant SOB and potential psycho. He doesn't go over the edge until AFTER the Wendigo is released.If you're wondering why the Wendigo required belief to manifest in the physical realm, just think about it It's the same way with God. The bible says that without faith it is impossible to please God. Faith is the key that activates God on our behalf, answers prayer, heals and moves mountains. Why would we think it's any different with spirit beings who aren't benign? The difference is that when they are released through belief they cause havoc and destruction rather than blessing.

A local hunter takes a disliking to the husband (Jake Weber) while the couple's son becomes increasingly concerned about their environment and a Native American legend -- the Wendigo, an angry spirit that can manifest as man, beast, tree or wind.Wendigo is not a conventional creature feature so if you're looking for a typical monster flick look elsewhere. The movie has a slow build-up filled with mundane drama, which some have criticized. Yet this is reminiscent of films like The Birds, where the main characters and a sense of realism are well established before things get going.Wendigo is a mood piece more than anything else. The mysteriousness of the lonely Catskill woods is evoked along with a sense of wonder and fear of the unknown. It's a vibe more akin to The Mothman Prophecies than Ogre. Like The Mothman Prophecies Wendigo is somehow a pleasure just to watch (as long as you're not psyched-up for a monster-slasher flick). There's a quiet style and expertise to the filmmaking that smacks of professionalism.Patricia Clarkson is effective as the wife\/mother and little Erik Per Sullivan is excellent as the son, Miles.Interestingly, none of the special effects were done with CGI, but rather cinematic techniques, costumes, make-up and creative editing. It works for me.The film leaves the viewer somewhat scratching his\/her head with its ambiguity. What conjured up the Wendigo? What's its purpose? How exactly does it devour people with its unquenchable hunger? Etc. Obviously if you like everything spelled out for you and don't like banging your head this is not the film for you.The film was shot in the Catskills, NY, and runs 91 minutes.GRADE B+ or A- POSSIBLE EXPLANATION (***SPOILER*** Don't read further if you haven't seen the film) Children are more sensitive to the spiritual realm because they haven't yet built up years of intellectual blockades along with social conditioning. It's clear that Miles senses malevolent creatures or spirits around him, which is why he and his mother check the closet and underneath the bed before he goes to sleep.The Wendigo is a spirit and can only manifest in the physical realm through an agent who releases the spirit through BELIEF. The Wendigo souvenir plays a role in the Wendigo's manifestation because it was created by someone who BELIEVED in the Wendigo; it's in essence an article of worship and, in a sense, an idol. Hence, the Wendigo is attracted to the figure, which can inspire BELIEF in certain individuals, like Miles.The ghostly Native American in the souvenir shop is obviously the Wendigo in human form. He's attracted to Miles because he senses belief and therefore guides the boy to the Wendigo figure and explains the legend. He says, No one believes in spirits anymore, but after sharing the story of the Wendigo he asks the boy if he believes, to which Miles responds, I guess so. This wasn't much, but it was all the Wendigo needed.
