Unfortunately, I have to disagree. While this movie is very good, and as well made as the original, I think the original has the edge.The reason for that is the script, which was just better, and more involved, the first time around. Here, there are dual narratives, one of which follows the traditional sequel route of showing that happened to the Corleone family after the events of the first movie, while the second is a prequel revealing how Vito Corleone became the mafia boss he ended up as.While I love Robert De Niro and I enjoyed the flashback scenes, I felt this whole sequence was slightly unnecessary. From the material given, the viewer can already guess how the De Niro character rose through the ranks and the events we witness feel a little bit superfluous. Sure, the pair of assassination scenes are excellent, but the rest just feels obvious and expected.Meanwhile, the Pacino narrative also has its problems, although cast and director aren't at fault; Coppola reunites many of his principals here and to excellent effect. However, there isn't nearly as much incident in the narrative and the whole story feels a little dragged out, a little over-emphasised. In the first film, the Pacino character had three or four major plot points to deal with, whereas this time the events are limited; for example, the entire film focuses on the situation with Roth, whereas in THE GODFATHER that would have just taken up half an hour or so. Therefore the ending, when it comes, is admittedly powerful, but not as effective in comparison to the genuinely amazing things we saw in the first film. It's been done before, and apart from a little more depth and character focus, we can't take much more away from this sequel. So it's very good, but not quite up there to the level of the first.

I can see how it might be groundbreaking and innovative back when it was made in the 40's, but in todays world, it is not amazing. It's very difficult to compare a movie from the 40's to a movie from the 21st century, in fact the only way I know to compare movies is based on my afterthoughts. What qualifies a movie as 10 stars for me, is a movie that either gives me the chills at the needs because of how amazing the ending was, or if the movie keeps me thinking about it for days afterward. It's a movie that has an ending that is permanently engraved in me. Movies like The Shawshank Redmption, The Sixth Sense, The Intouchables, Memento, The Green Mile, Full Metal Jacket, etc...A 9 star movie is a movie that I find to be entertaining, but not quite as memorable as a 10 star. The 9 star category for me has a lot of good movies in the category, such as Pulp Fiction, American Beauty, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Fight Club, etc... However, Casablanca is not as memorable as any of those movies either. The movie is not, I just don't find myself challenged by the movie. The acting was okay, but nothing that blew my mind. I understand the message of the movie, and how powerful it was supposed to be. The movie was slow, too slow for me. It left me with the same problems as the Godfather; I think that the movie is building up to some dramatic ending, but then it just mellows out. This seems like the kind of movie that was regarded as the best of all time for many years, but, unfortunately for fans of this movie, there are many other movies that surpass this one. My opinion is that people tend to rate movies they consider classics higher than the new blockbusters, even if both eras are capable of producing movies that are equally as good as one another. Honestly, the only reason why this movie doesn't get a higher rating than it has (from me) is because there was never a part in the movie where I felt like I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, but there were scenes where I began to fall asleep. Five minutes after the movie was over, I found myself thinking about my plans for the following day, and what I planned on having for dinner. When I watched higher rated movies, for example Into The Wild (10 stars), I found myself putting myself into the protagonists situation, and then i found myself running to the bookstore to get the book about the true story. This movie didn't have that lasting impression on me.Even though my opinion is most likely contrary to every other movie watcher on here, I think that i have a valid point by saying that this moving brings nothing revolutionary to the table, and by that I mean that there is no part of this movie that leaves me teary eyed, laughing hysterically, or piece together a complex mystery.

Throwing everything they can think of in your face. Adult humor, goofy humor, really dark moments, all kinds of weird stuff. Then an animal tamer (director Richard Donner) comes in to put the animal back in focus. Showing him that he is still a A Christmas Carol modern day retelling that is suppose to be heartwarming. Still make it funny and goofy, but not go to far. Finally just to be an entertaining time for tourists. Which made me give this attraction a thumbs up.The story is about a man named Francis Xavier Cross (Bill Murray) a TV executive who is a cruel harsh jerk that loves to humiliate and torment his co-workers. In order to boost his career and keep it alive, also he loves the holiday season. For the reason of all the commercial during the time. Making a giant live TV special of A Christmas Carol due to as he puts it All these little idiots are going to be watching the boob tube. He gets visited the night before Christmas Eve by the ghost of his old business partner Lew (John Forsythe) telling him he's going to be visited by the three ghosts of Christmas. The Past, Present, and Future to show him at he error of his ways. So things do get a little chaotic. Now he must either learn the way to live, or spent the rest of his life ruining other people lives.Half of the charm of the movie comes from how inventive the story is when it comes to A Christmas Carol. It finds ways to still keep you engaged with the plot even though you know what's going to happen. For example Bob Cratchit from the original has been split up into two characters. Bobcat Goldthwait's character who is really funny, and Alfre Woodard's character who is likable and the mother of the Timmy Tim of the movie. (Which is not sick in the movie if you read the Charles Dickens book). The other charm of the movie is the humor, mostly due to Bill Murray. He is one of those actors who can play those jerk protagonist, and the writers took that to a full extent. His character is a harsh, cruel, mean dirt-bag, doing some very nasty stuff. Like reacting really gladly to the fact that the crazy commercial he made for A Christmas Carol was an old lady having a heart attack once she saw it. But he is so fun to watch as he does this harsh because he knows how to make at least funny. He has done this kind of role before, so he has some experience. Saying he is just funny is more of an understatement. He is also really emotionally dramatic at times, giving off some very believable emotional performances. Due to that we actually learn a lot about this guy threw the movie, and his setup was also really good too. He is definitely the best character in the movie. The more I think about it I think the only reason people went to work on this movie is because Bill Murray was in it and he was big back in the 80s. Doing popular movies like Caddyshack, Stripes, and probably his most famous Ghostbusters. Speaking of the characters all the other people in the movie are really enjoyable too. Karen Allen as Frank's girlfriend brings a likable charm to the character that would put a smile on your face. John Fortsythe as Frank's old business partner was nice to see for his little scene. David Johansen was fun to watch as the Ghost of Christmas Past. Carol Kane as the Ghost of Christmas Present gets kind of annoying at times but I still enjoyed seeing her on screen. It's just a fun batch of characters that were all likable and entertaining in their own way.Although the movie is not for everyone (due to it getting a mixed reaction). There will be some things in the movie that might annoy people, or just make them go Whaaaat? Like the fact that the opening of the movie is (I kid you not) a terrorist attack at Santa's Workshop. Then again I never thought it was too annoying, since the movie also is a satire of pop culture, and that part was making fun of the weird Santa Claus movies in the 30s - 50s. Ones like Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. Also I don't feel this is the first movie you should watch when you want to get the Christmas feeling. But at the same time I'm not sure about that, because the director keeps everything in focus. Still trying to get the magic Christmas spark, and Bill Murray does get the emotional parts right. Even though some might kinda fall flat to people.In the end Scrooged is a movie that depends on how you look at it. If you're one of those people who loves the heartwarming Christmas classics like Miracle on 34th Street or A Charlie Brown Christmas this most likely won't please you. But if you're one of those people who is a fan of Bill Murray and likes a good Christmas comedy like National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation there is a good chance you'll like this movie. I still recommend it to at least try the movie, because the negative people might find something enjoyable in the movie. Me I really enjoyed the movie. I don't think it will be fondly remembered in the future, but I'll still remember it years later in the Christmas Future.

It finds ways to still keep you engaged with the plot even though you know what's going to happen. For example Bob Cratchit from the original has been split up into two characters. Bobcat Goldthwait's character who is really funny, and Alfre Woodard's character who is likable and the mother of the Timmy Tim of the movie. (Which is not sick in the movie if you read the Charles Dickens book). The other charm of the movie is the humor, mostly due to Bill Murray. He is one of those actors who can play those jerk protagonist, and the writers took that to a full extent. His character is a harsh, cruel, mean dirt-bag, doing some very nasty stuff. Like reacting really gladly to the fact that the crazy commercial he made for A Christmas Carol was an old lady having a heart attack once she saw it. But he is so fun to watch as he does this harsh because he knows how to make at least funny. He has done this kind of role before, so he has some experience. Saying he is just funny is more of an understatement. He is also really emotionally dramatic at times, giving off some very believable emotional performances. Due to that we actually learn a lot about this guy threw the movie, and his setup was also really good too. He is definitely the best character in the movie. The more I think about it I think the only reason people went to work on this movie is because Bill Murray was in it and he was big back in the 80s. Doing popular movies like Caddyshack, Stripes, and probably his most famous Ghostbusters. Speaking of the characters all the other people in the movie are really enjoyable too. Karen Allen as Frank's girlfriend brings a likable charm to the character that would put a smile on your face. John Fortsythe as Frank's old business partner was nice to see for his little scene. David Johansen was fun to watch as the Ghost of Christmas Past. Carol Kane as the Ghost of Christmas Present gets kind of annoying at times but I still enjoyed seeing her on screen. It's just a fun batch of characters that were all likable and entertaining in their own way.Although the movie is not for everyone (due to it getting a mixed reaction). There will be some things in the movie that might annoy people, or just make them go Whaaaat? Like the fact that the opening of the movie is (I kid you not) a terrorist attack at Santa's Workshop. Then again I never thought it was too annoying, since the movie also is a satire of pop culture, and that part was making fun of the weird Santa Claus movies in the 30s - 50s. Ones like Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. Also I don't feel this is the first movie you should watch when you want to get the Christmas feeling. But at the same time I'm not sure about that, because the director keeps everything in focus. Still trying to get the magic Christmas spark, and Bill Murray does get the emotional parts right. Even though some might kinda fall flat to people.In the end Scrooged is a movie that depends on how you look at it. If you're one of those people who loves the heartwarming Christmas classics like Miracle on 34th Street or A Charlie Brown Christmas this most likely won't please you. But if you're one of those people who is a fan of Bill Murray and likes a good Christmas comedy like National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation there is a good chance you'll like this movie. I still recommend it to at least try the movie, because the negative people might find something enjoyable in the movie. Me I really enjoyed the movie. I don't think it will be fondly remembered in the future, but I'll still remember it years later in the Christmas Future.

No?! well it sure as hell seems like it as the ever cuddly Scott Bakula portrays the same character he's always ever portrayed with the exact same haircut too...geez dude!. So lets not beat around the bush here, this is the late in the day 'Major League' clone that shamelessly rips every clichéd idea from that film whilst attempting to look all innocent by turning it into a college football flick.The plot is different of course, but end of the day it still involves a coach and his assistant trying to muster together a half decent team which ultimately ends up being a bunch of misfits, freaks, girls and Scott Bakula. From there on we get all the regular sports clichés and predictable fluff such as the team losing all the time, losing faith in their coach, a soppy romance, a rival team of assholes, the resurgence of the team and one man behind the scenes taking joy in the teams failure and trying to amplify it.I think the problem with this film other than the fact its a lame clone, is they simply haven't created any fun characters to follow or care about. As I've already said Bakula plays the same character he always does, then you have a bloke who thinks he's a samurai warrior, the nerdy guy with specs, a huge Samoan guy, an Aussie?! (why would an Aussie be there?), a black guy who can't catch, a ex-military obsessed bloke, a female kicker and finally the hilarious comedian Sinbad...add sarcastic quips here. There are of course other faceless jock meathead players also.Hell to even make sure they copied every single aspect of 'Major League' they even have a light-hearted announcer for the games...and its Rob Schneider! oh the quality. I really shouldn't keep going on about the similarities but its impossible not too! just look at the films poster, its identical in every way! unbelievable!.The only big change in this film is the team doesn't actually win any league or championship in the end, they lose a load, tie a game and their final game of the season they manage to beat the top team but that's it. They presumably still end up near the bottom of their group or league, so we don't get the obligatory montage of wins when they turn their game around. What we do get is a sickly bit of crap when their coach goes into hospital of a suspected heart attack just in time for the final big game against the top team. We then get a vomit inducing scene where second in command Loggia tells the team to go and win it for the coach, possibly his last wish on Earth. Personally I thought this was all a set up to get the team to play well, or at least Loggia's character was exaggerating the illness and the coaches last words on purpose. Nope it was all for real, the illness isn't as bad as suspected, but the shitty clichéd corny attempt at a rousing emotional scene was indeed for real.This really is a prime example of an early 90's straight to the videoshop piece of turd trying to leech off the success of another earlier franchise. There are literately no redeeming features anywhere I can think of, its not funny, its not cheeky or rude as suggested by the poster, you have no interest in any characters, even the game sequences aren't very good or exciting...its just poorly made trash that didn't need to be made.2\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 April 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" So...is this an episode of 'Quantum Leap' following the constant adventures of 'Sam Beckett'?.

Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro envision gangster film gods, and Marty redefines the crime genre with Goodfellas in a way that Casino, Mean Streets, or The Departed don't even begin to touch.The coolest thing about this film is not its excessive use of the F- bomb, the memorable dialogue, the direction, or even the story. It's Pesci. The Oscar he won for this film is one of the most deserving wins in Academy history. His speech is one of the most appropriate, too.

When he arrives he explains the misunderstanding to a castle full of people after winning a couple of fights with zombies. Then he must go find the book called The Necrimonicon and utter the words Klaatu Berada Nicto (nice reference there! Watch The Day The Earth Stood Still much?) and unwittingly unleashes an army of dead people including Ash's evil twin spawned from The Necrimonicon. He then decides after realising he's f#cked up he decides to save them using the technology from his time which was transported along with his car to the time.Okay, the movie is essentially a dumber yet more awesome version of Oz The Great and Powerful. There's even probably the most contrived of love relationships that ends with the girl turning evil. Oh and I'm not kidding - The love relationship in this movie is borderline Animated Titanic territory.Not to mention this movie is hilarious.

I was always thought that film should be an emotional experience; it should make you laugh, cry or be scared. But it should also inspire and provoke you and make you reflect. And that's exactly what Williams Friedkin's The Exorcist does, it both scares the audience witless, but most importantly it posses the intelligence to provoke and ask questions. When we think about the battle between good and evil, we looked to heaven and hell, too the superhero comics, too the war field of opposing countries. What we cease to forget the most prevalent battled between good and evil, is the one we all have to deal with on daily bases. For the greatest battles occurs on a more personal plane, the struggle we all face as we must choose between what is right or wrong, or the struggle of one's decision to accept region or two turn their back on it. The Exorcist is a film that seeks to unravel the mystery around faith, and the chilling truth between what we deem to be evil. And it's the ability of The Exorcist in to delve such an honest and uncompromising subject that has been neglected by cinema for so long, in exchange for the big budget spectacles, rather than focusing on the more important, the human condition. That has meant over 40 years later, its messages and themes, are still as relevant and potent as they were in 1973. But most importantly, after all those years as effortlessly retained its ability to frighten, and should be no surprise that no matter if you watched The Exorcist when it first came out or 40 years later, it still takes you on a bone chilling journey into your deep darkest nightmares. And guess what! It's all based on a true story, 1949 in Silver Spring Maryland to be exact. William Friedkin's takes both William Peter Blatty's novel and screenplay and weaves frightening real life tale of a movie stars who fights to determine the reason behind her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) violent mood swings, retreating health, and rotating head. She seeks medical, physiological and finally spiritual help to determine whether it is a deep seeded mental and physiological issue or is she truly being inhabited by a malevolent entity. The cinematography in The Exorcist is probably the best in horror film history; the delicate balance between light and dark fashioned by Owen Roizmans complements the piece superbly, acting almost as the perfect metaphor between the delicate balance between good and evil. You just have to look at the scene that has rightly been used on every advertising campaign and poster for the film, the one where Father Merrin steps out of the taxi in a fog filled street, only partially lit by one solitary light, It was both artistically stunning yet goose bump inducing chilly. The inspiration of the composition came to Friedkin from the portrait Empire of Light by Rene Magritte, which I felt suited the film perfectly. Another aspect of the film I enjoyed the most, where ironically performances of the two actors void of any acting experience before hand. Linda Blair was practically forced to audition for the roll by her mother and Jason Miller who played Damien Karras, wasn't even a trained actor and was in fact a play write and was studying to a real life priest. But looking back I suppose it was the lack of experience that brought so much fresh energy and vigour to the roll, because they weren't so self-conscious and preoccupied with how they were acting and pleasing Friedkin, but instead focused on actually being present in the scene, feeling all the same emotions the characters would be feeling. Over the years I have discovered that most people take out of The Exorcist what they bring in to itSo if you throw your entire being into the film and are willing to suspend your disbelief, then I guarantee The Exorcist will scare you in such away, that it will permanently leave a mark on your deepest subconscious, whilst shaking you to the very core of your being.

Oldman's punk rock appearance looks so much like the real Sid Vicious, it's uncanny. This biographical tale is told in a creative and humorous handling of story, it makes it all so compelling. There are some bits that shock, violence, per see, like Oldman carving his intials in his chest, for a female fan. The way it's told is offbeat, and truly original, that has me loving the movie just as much as last time I've seen it, which let me tell you, is a few times. If Sid really did kill Nancy, which we are kind left in a hazy judgement, the film does it's best on recounting what went down. The Sex Pistols as illustrated here were the most raucous and unruly I've ever seen, Vicious at one stage, knocking out a member of the audience, and disposing of an empty beer glass on the sidewalk, only for starters. Sid and Nancy lived like pigs, one scene has them sitting up in bed, accepting their fate as they watch their hotel room go up in flames, played to a haunting music score. The movie does have great music too. Through the whole story we see how the relationship, Sid and Nancy had, suffered. Nancy in a phenomenal performance by Webb, had faced a lot of rejection if from family, whatever. The family reunion part, that does provide some humorous moments. Nancy also worked at a S and M bordello, to feed her drug habit. One bordello scene, that doesn't feature Nancy, with a client hanging from a ceiling, is a riot. I just love the way the stories formulated, with some nifty touches, one that dream sequence with Nancy coming back from the dead at the end, rolling up in a limousine, all dolled up. Another one has Sid revealing himself to a band of kids where at the mentioning of the name, they scuttle away, but the last part is done in EXTREME fast forward. Director Cox has had fun making this, and this is an impressive piece of filmmaking, considering Cox had made the much smaller film, cult hit Repo Man, a film that does indeed stand small against this. Oldman and Webb ought to be commended. The acting speaks for itself. I'd recommended this film, just for watching these actors in prized performances that are so authentically real, they'll stay with you forever.

Some of the jokes like the Bridge Of Death was actually pretty funny and I'll admit that The Black Knight did warrant a laugh out of me and Camelot did make me chuckle among others. So this movie is worth it.So I guess if you like this kind of thing or want to see what most people consider funny in some way then I would say give this a checking out. If you're not used to Monty Python's style that can kind of throw you off guard like it did with me after never watching this movie (or any movie of theirs) for a long time. I can see why it has a very strong fan base but me personally - it's decent enough, nothing special.
