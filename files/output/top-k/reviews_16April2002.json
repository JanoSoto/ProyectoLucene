I bought it on video after I had seen a preview for it on the film FINAL DESTINATION. And that was one of the smartest things I had done that week. 15 MINUTES is one action packed thrill ride of a movie! Here's the story(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) two eastern European criminals come to the United States looking for money owed to them, but end up killing the people in debt. After that, they begin committing a series of video taped murders and turning the streets of New York into their battleground. Here's where a legendary cop named Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) comes in. Him and a rookie arson investigator (Edward Burns). Together, they must stop the rampage. This movie gives a good look at the world today. It shows how people are never punished for their crimes (well, not always). They come up with a motive to plead insane to the court that tries them, get sent to a mental hospital and then plead sane once they are in the hospital. Have tests run on them, certify that they are sane, leave the asylum- rich and famous. And because of the double jeopardy law, not be tried for the same crime twice. An ingenious plan. Today, if people didn't know any better, that would work. It shows how people don't take enough action towards murderers and other criminals. But, then there are some of the action sequences. Intense. The scenes that go through the video camera we also great. Negative art and other video effects are used. It is also nice to see Kelsey Grammer (in a role other than his usual sissified character Frasier) as a tabloid reporter who is just looking for good ratings on his late night show. This is one action thriller than delivers the goods. It is different, and in the end, everything goes about happily. However, that is not always the case in real life, but since this is film, happy endings and stupid stuff are allowed. But stupid this movie is not. *MAJOR SPOILER* I am only so upset that half-way through the movie (Prepare yourself if you haven't seen the movie) Robert De Niro's character is killed!!! That is the worst part of the entire movie! I was shocked beyond belief. Since he is listed as the main character in this film, I was expecting him to have survived somehow by some magic leap of faith, but no! It is up to Edward Burns to save the rest of the movie. And that he does. He should be listed as the film's central character and Robert De Niro the second. But since De Niro is a bigger name that Burns is, that's how things are going to go. 15 MINUTES was definetly the year's best action thriller. I give this one 5\/5.

Today, if people didn't know any better, that would work. It shows how people don't take enough action towards murderers and other criminals. But, then there are some of the action sequences. Intense. The scenes that go through the video camera we also great. Negative art and other video effects are used. It is also nice to see Kelsey Grammer (in a role other than his usual sissified character Frasier) as a tabloid reporter who is just looking for good ratings on his late night show. This is one action thriller than delivers the goods. It is different, and in the end, everything goes about happily. However, that is not always the case in real life, but since this is film, happy endings and stupid stuff are allowed. But stupid this movie is not. *MAJOR SPOILER* I am only so upset that half-way through the movie (Prepare yourself if you haven't seen the movie) Robert De Niro's character is killed!!! That is the worst part of the entire movie! I was shocked beyond belief. Since he is listed as the main character in this film, I was expecting him to have survived somehow by some magic leap of faith, but no! It is up to Edward Burns to save the rest of the movie. And that he does. He should be listed as the film's central character and Robert De Niro the second. But since De Niro is a bigger name that Burns is, that's how things are going to go. 15 MINUTES was definetly the year's best action thriller. I give this one 5\/5.

His films to date have all been worthy of merit but also suffered from a childish sentimental overload. Ironically with his last film, Almost Famous, a sentimental semi true portrait of Crowe's early reporting days, the director threatened to grow up, creating an enjoying offering of rock and roll life style. Now it seems with his latest film Vanilla Sky, Crowe has finally become a man. A remake of the thriller by Alejandro Amenábar, it concerns David Aames (Tom Cruise), a wealthy 30-year-old who has inherited daddy's magazine empire. He spends his days speeding around the streets of New York in a Ford Mustang and his nights cavorting with the sexy but slightly disturbing Julie Gianni played excellently by Cameron Diaz. Aames's yuppie life is turned upside down when he meets the engaging Sofia (Penelope Cruz). His life then takes a much more dramatic turn when he is involved in a car crash. That's the coherent part of the film. The plot then dives into surrealism head on, as Aames can't define what's real and what is a dream, as the remainder of the film is told through flashback. Visually, the film makes much of the premise of a dream world with short parts of events flashed up on screen with Aames in various situations, and the seeds of curiosity grow. Cruise is exceptionally good as the tortured and confused Aames and is helped by a tremendous supporting cast. The English actor Timothy Spall is under-used in a loyal butler type role and the now seldom seen Kurt Russell also proves his worth as a caring psychologist. And then there's Penelope Cruz. She plays her part well, is beautiful and she speaks with a quirky pseudo-Spanish accent. That's it. The film does have several shortcomings. Crowe's obsession with Cruise yes, that's Cruise not the beautiful female Cruz, is slightly worrying. As with the actor\/director pair's previous film, Jerry Maguire, Cruise and his shiny white teeth appear in almost every frame of the film. Every other scene is a one-minute pop video, gelling music and visuals to an exhausting extent and suggesting this film is targeted solely at the MTV generation. However due to a strong cast, a grown-up director and Cameron Diaz's legs, Vanilla Sky offers food for thought and certainly justifies the ticket price.

Matthew Perry is a very talented comic actor, and he's hysterical on Friends as the sarcastic Chandler Bing.  The movie was released shortly after he became popular on the show.  His sarcastic schtick works great in sitcoms, but in this movie it gets jarring at times.  There are some moments that don't require any comic relief, and he breaks the moment with his broad sarcasm.  The story is slightly predictable, with every mishap you would expect in a comedy of this type--the parents of each family dislike each other, the girls leaves him towards the end, we're faced with the typical climax of him chasing after her.  But I did enjoy the way the film used the theme of fate.  Though it may seem a little far-fetched that our main character meets his future love interest on the line to the bathroom in a Mexican restaurant and it's love at first sight, I'm sure many relationships do start out that way.  Fate works in mysterious ways.  Salma Hayek has never looked more beautiful, in her first starring role--her past roles being brief appearances in films like From Dusk Till Dawn and Fair Game--and she shows great charisma.  There are some funny moments, mostly due to Perry's routines--though he sometimes fails, assuming that he's still on a sitcom set.  It's pretty nifty that his real-life father, John Bennett Perry, is casted as his character's father.  There are too many films where the parents don't look a thing like their sons or daughters, and it wasn't the case this time around and naturally the chemistry was already there.

My earlier comments have been written without me preparing a script, so I have done that this time. Let me start at the beginning of the film. Galadriel (unseen) starts the opening narration (the world is changed.....) and at this time, no matter how many times I see it, I start gasping for air, and I feel like the film becomes part of me. No film has ever had this effect on me before, without anything really happening, and I can´t explain it. Then the Theme of the Ring plays over the films title, and it is so sad, yet beautiful, that it wonderfully prepares you for a tragic and sad story that will be enlivened by humour. Then follows a short retelling of the forging of the Rings of Power, with the unforgettably sad image of the nine kings who will return as the Nazgul. And the amazing battle-scene at the foot of Mount Doom, in which the ring comes to Isuldur. He is then ambushed and killed, and the scene where he floats dead in the Anduin brings tears to my eyes no matter how many times I see it. This says a lot about Peter Jacksons achievement Despite that he has made a film laden with SFX, he has managed to bring back to (big-budget-)movies something basic that has been lost since Star Wars or so To make a film really affect your emotions! All right, perhaps it hasn´t been entirely lost, but I have never experienced it to this effect.

Galadriel (unseen) starts the opening narration (the world is changed.....) and at this time, no matter how many times I see it, I start gasping for air, and I feel like the film becomes part of me. No film has ever had this effect on me before, without anything really happening, and I can´t explain it.

Everything about the film could be of good use for studying in writing and film classes.You have David Dunn, a character who perfectly fits the superhero mold.  He is an average Joe and seems to be a bit of uncomfortable in his oversized suit in the opening scene.  In a typical superhero origin story, he knows not that he is special.  So even after he is the sole survivor of a massive train wreck, he doesn't know what to make of it until along comes Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson), a comic book connoisseur who thinks-but is not sure-that David may be one of the people that his comic books are written about.Elijah is a main character himself as he is the opposite of David from the very beginning of the film.  He is a man who is quite breakable, unlike the never-been-sick David.  How far different the two characters are is not revealed until the end.  Between then and the beginning is a good look at a superhero's life trying to patch up a broken marriage, raise a son, discovering the limits of his powers, and analyze the relationships of characters in comics.Even more intricate than the plot is the magnificent camera work, cinematography, direction, and sound.  The framing of most of the shots in the film is a great take on the comic book theme, which themselves are frames within a page.  So in shots you will have a banister, a doorframe, train seats, etc. framing up the shot.  It's done to a noticeable extent. The shot lengths themselves are long and show how well the actors play their parts since some shots are over a minute long like in a Kubrick production. Also of note is how-as Elijah comments on-the villains in David's telepathic-like visions stand out in a crowd.  In the crowded scenes, there is very little color by 99% of those around.  But those who rub against David that wear a colored type of clothing cause flashes of their crimes to appear in his head.  When we get a better shot of the perp later, they definitely look like they stand out.  There is the guy in the vivid camouflage jacket, the drug dealer in the deep blue windbreaker (played by M.

I'm sure that many who have posted negative comments are simply overwhelmed by their own political incorrectness during the movie.There are several moments in this movie when it is totally inappropriate to let out a good laugh, but also unavoidable. (When Mrs. Lundegard jumps out of the car blindfolded and tries to escape from her kidnappers through the snow, for example. Its a moment of obvious pure terror for her, but her callous and brutal kidnappers break down laughing and I'm afraid we do too.) That is what makes it so very good!If you don't feel right laughing at black humor, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!And those who critisize the well-deserved oscar of Frances McDormand just don't get it at all. The very pregnant and rustic Chief of Police, Marge Gunderson, whose husband likes to paint mallards and ice fish, may be a little folksy, for some, but believe it or not, most people in the States aren't actually from New York City or LA! Some of them really do have to jump start their prowlers at 400 AM in 15 below zero weather.There are actually small town police chiefs just like Marge all over America. And let's not forget that as goofy as she may look and talk, when she gets on the case, she is onto the bad guys almost from the start and pursues them with the single minded tenacity of a laser guided missile. I'm sure that there are real cops across America for whom Marge Gunderson, represented a very realistic portrayal.No, I'm sorry some of you didn't like this movie, but for me it was a surprisingly deep, dark and astute piece of work for an American film. And I place Brainard Chief of Police Marge Gunderson right up there with Sam Spade, Columbo and Hercule Poirot among my all time favorite detectives and I would simply love to see her in action again.If you still haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself to give this one a shot.

I'm sure that there are real cops across America for whom Marge Gunderson, represented a very realistic portrayal.No, I'm sorry some of you didn't like this movie, but for me it was a surprisingly deep, dark and astute piece of work for an American film. And I place Brainard Chief of Police Marge Gunderson right up there with Sam Spade, Columbo and Hercule Poirot among my all time favorite detectives and I would simply love to see her in action again.If you still haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself to give this one a shot.

I'm sure that many who have posted negative comments are simply overwhelmed by their own political incorrectness during the movie.There are several moments in this movie when it is totally inappropriate to let out a good laugh, but also unavoidable. (When Mrs. Lundegard jumps out of the car blindfolded and tries to escape from her kidnappers through the snow, for example. Its a moment of obvious pure terror for her, but her callous and brutal kidnappers break down laughing and I'm afraid we do too.) That is what makes it so very good!If you don't feel right laughing at black humor, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!And those who critisize the well-deserved oscar of Frances McDormand just don't get it at all.

I'll just give you a quick review of what I thought were the best and worst aspects of this movie. Bad aspects; the storyline was lame and poorly portrayed as the script was lacking and the pacing off. Macauly Culkin said everything in the same monotonous tone, to watch it you'd think he was just passing by the set and had reluctantly agreed to stand in for the real actor and read the lines off a board. The woman who played the mother was just plain irritating to the point where you wished the evil son would just get it over with already! The ending was lousy and a let-down for the partially promising tension the young actors (Culkin and Wood) had previously established. **SPOILER** no mother would ever do that! **SPOILER FINISHED** You're maybe wondering why I watched this movie then, well one simple factor; Elijah Wood. I borrowed the tape off a friend because I had heard he was on it and being a long-time fan of his I was eager to see it. I was not disappinted, he played the part with such rare innocence and sweetness you had to go 'awwww' as soon as he appeared your eyes were drawn immediately to him and he carried the film remarkably well. Having seen this film I am more convinced than ever that Elijah is going to be the actor of his generation and I am sure that his work in the masterpiece LOTR will soon go rewarded with an Oscar in either 2003 or 2004. He takes a film which could have been a total loss and turned it into something oddly unique and touching. Apologies for gushing but I cannot resist, even at the age of 12, Elijah had the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen, I wish him the very best because any actor that could take this film and turn it into something I would be happy to watch again deserves all the credit and praise going. I can't tell you whether to see this film or not, if you are an Elijah fan it's unmissable but if not I am unsure whether this film will draw you in enough and hold your interest long enough.

By the time it came to the theater in my little rural hometown a year after its release, Julie Andrews had already won an Oscar for her work as the title character.  Not that that mattered.  To the kids in my class at school, this was the hot, must-see movie of that summer--the way Star Wars would be in the next decade.  I can still remember laughing over Dick Van Dyke tap-dancing with the penguins and crying during the Bird Woman song (which was as much social commentary as a sentimental tune about our feathered friends). I became a fan of Dick Van Dyke's show after this--he basically won my heart as Bert--the jack-of-all-trades special friend to Mary and the Banks' children.  For the rest of that summer, man, I WAS Mary Poppins.  My mom bought me a record of all the songs, I used her old Avon sample case as my carpetbag, and I acted out the movie every day. If VCRs and DVDs had been everyday household items then, I would have asked for Mary Poppins for Christmas. (It would have been worn out by Easter, most likely!)As happens to children almost overnight, my interests changed over the next year and I sort of got over my fixation with Mary, Bert, et. al.  After all, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke went on to other things after that, so why not me?  And then in the 90s, Disney re-released Mary Poppins as a video.  I bought it for my daughter (or at least that was the excuse I gave my husband).  Though she was too young to understand everything in the movie--just as I was the first time I saw it--she, too, loved Mary Poppity as she called it.  We must have played it at least 3 times a week during the first summer we had it, while living in temporary housing and waiting for our house to be built.  She, too, loves to act this one out and to sing the songs for hours on end.  The apple does not fall far from the tree, I guess.As for me. . .it's all I remembered it to be, and then some. For starters, the music. . .what was missing from the old record I had were the overture, underscores, and closing score--they were beautifully put together.  And the little details are delightful, too.  Among them  Mrs. Banks, who is a feminist (at least when Mr. Banks isn't around) wears bloomers--and later in the movie, we discover Mary Poppins does, too.  (don't blink, or you'll miss seeing them)  The relationship between Mary and Bert. . .as a child I thought they were probably a couple but never had time to see each other because of their work.  Now?  I think they would be a couple if they got a lucky break.  Let's face it--she's a nanny and he's a lower-level tradesman.  Even if they did get married,  in 1910, the realities of British society were such that if you weren't part of the gentry, you worked for a living, and changing your class or status didn't happen.  A shame, because their characters obviously love children very much.  So they do the next best thing--work together as a team to bring happiness to British middle-class homes--mainly by shaking up the parents.  Mary was no ordinary nanny, but Bert made her an even better one--he was the idea man, and she handled the implementation. And therein is the secret  this movie was not as much about Mary, Bert, and the kids as it is about Mary, Bert, and Mr. and Mrs. Banks.  It's when Mr. Banks realizes that his children don't need a nanny to be happy--they just need their parents to love them and give them their attention--that he also becomes the man that the Bank needs.
