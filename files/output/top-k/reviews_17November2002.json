So so at best was my thought.Then one day while I was doing something else, I put it on as background and suddenly found myself paying attention.  (Probably worth noting at this point that I've only seen it on TV - it takes a rare film to drag me into a theatre - but this is one film I'd love to see in a theatre.)  Time to look it up in IMDB and read the comments and other information carefully. Wow, a lot of people really like this, and a lot of people really HATE it.I made a point to watch it again the next evening, put the sound through the stereo, turn the volume up a bit, turn lights down.  Often enough when I do this, about five minutes into the film I get bored and go off to do something else.  Not with Moulin Rouge! - I was hooked.Since then I've seen it several times and every time I watch it, I find more to like - a bit more to dislike as well - but the stuff to like is by far the larger part.The plot is hackneyed, the pacing uneven, the editing at times intrusive.On the other hand ...Think Max Ernst (Une Semaine de Bonte'), Salvadore Dali, even Picasso. Think  Lewis Carroll, Reymond Queneau, James Joyce. And most especially, remember opera.Moulin Rouge! is a surrealist collage, a mix of dreamscape and reality. Its an impressionist cityscape built almost of pointilliste scale cinematic (and audio) Legos --  symbols, allusions, quotes,  archetypes, a dash of postmodern sensibility.  Its an operatic (spectacular!) spectacular with its own leitmotifs, and as (often enough) in  opera, its not the story that matters most.Luhrmann presides over the production with vision and discipline.  What sometimes looks like a mess on first viewing reveals itself (usually -- there are some exceptions) on closer consideration to be a very deliberately constructed stew -- filled with detail and allusion.  Musically, we often hear the shortsighted say None of the music is original -- but why should that be a bad thing?  By using music we know, Luhrmann gets to play off our associations of one piece against another, of music against performer, and of music against visual.  Think Zidler doing Like a Virgin, or the Paris toffs with Teen Spirit.You can almost imagine Luhrmann taking a favored collection of films (and cartoons), music and other bits of cultural detritus and cutting it all up and heaping it up, then taking out bits as he comes to them and putting them all together into a whole.  Luhrmann's vision combines a very carefully planned visual style, an equally carefully planned musical score, some wondrous choreography, an oddly wonderful sense of humour and, well, lots more.  He builds from these pieces a whole that is  brilliant, coherent, compelling, funny and wholly his own.And to top it off, its a whole pile of fun.Watch for the allusions - the moon from the Lumiere brothers is the most obvious from film, but there are many more.  I think you could do a final exam for a film course by showing a ten minute segment from this film (almost at random) and asking students to note down all the films referred to.And watch for the stuff that just flashes by.

In that sequence we see Cassius Clay preparing for his upcoming title fight with Sonny Liston in Miami. While seeing him prepare, we see Liston destroying an opponent in the ring. We also see the hints of racial tension going on in southern USA, 1964. The entire sequence lasts approximately 8-10 minutes. It is long, drawn-out, and boring. It's the perfect opening sequence for this film.That's because that's exactly how this movie feels  long, drawn-out, and boring.How could someone make a film about Muhammad Ali's life & manage to make the film boring ?!?!? Here's some ways  have long (and unnecessarily drawn-out) scenes (ie  the dance scene where he meets his first wife), or simply have recreations of now-famous media scenes (the Cosell scenes ; the pre-fight scenes). I understand the need for these scenes, but I would rather watch the actual scenes than a recreations of them.By concentrating on such aspects of Ali's life, Michael Mann totally bypasses what I feel could have been more interesting aspects of Ali's life. For instance, I would have liked to see more of the conversation between the newly-named Ali & his father, as they argue on the significance of the Clay name. That scene had the potential to be very revealing. I also would have liked to have seen more of Ali's first visit to Africa, when he went on his Muslim pilgrimage. Instead, the whole event is used as a way to say goodbye to Malcolm X in the film. To me, that whole part of the film could have been very significant. What did Ali see when he went on the pilgrimage ? How did it affect his life ? Did he recall any of Africa when he went back there to fight Foreman ? We'll never know from this film.I would like to have seen more scenes such as him and Joe Frazier in the car together. That was one of my favorite scenes in the movie. It gave me a chance to see more of something that is impossible for me to ever see  an actual private conversation between Ali & Frazier.But there are tons of other things that are left out of the film as well. For instance, after Ali loses to Frazier in the first fight, we don't really even get a chance to see how his first loss as a professional affects his life. This is Muhammad Ali ! How did it feel to him to lose for the first time in his life ? Eventhough Ali played it off in the media as if it didn't affect him, did it in reality ? We'll never know from this film.The pacing of the film was just terrible. As I said, the opening sequence was long, drawn-out, and boring - and was the perfect opening sequence for this film. That's because it is a microcosm of the entire film.You want bad pacing ? Try this  It actually took the entire first 55 minutes of this film for Cassius Clay to actually defeat Sonny Liston ! The opening sequence was all about him prepping for the fight, and it continued on to the weigh in of the fight, and the prefight comments etc. Then the fight itself was actually quite boring.More bad pacing  The film goes into the mid-sixties in a daze. It doesn't really start to show anything until finally Ali has his now-famous interview with Cosell. In this scene Cosell tells him behind the scene how the government is worried of black militant groups. That is when I felt the film MIGHT start to become more interesting. I looked at my watch to see that nearly 2 HOURS had passed in the film !Even MORE bad pacing  Ali gets his fight with Frazier. Ali loses the fight. But we as the audience never really get to see the true level of brutality of that fight. Between that and the Thrilla In Manila (which was completely dropped from the film) we never really get a chance to see the true damage that those two fighters endured and delivered in their fights against one another. Instead, we see glimpses of the fight, Ali's knockdown, and a few other aspects. But really it just goes straight to the next scene after that, which has Ali & his crew watching Foreman defeat Frazier. (Like I said, no concern is given on how Ali's first loss affected his psyche). After that, it is straight to Ali-Foreman. Full Rumble In The Jungle  Don King, Africa, Zaire etc etc.This was actually probably the best part of the film. The film takes on a more personal look at Ali when he is prepping for the fight in Zaire. We get to see him connecting with the people. Again, I would have liked to see if he recalled anything from his previous visit to Africa - but that was not to be.Even worst, the Foreman fight managed to look boring ! Still, while the fight itself looked boring, I will admit that Michael Mann did a brilliant job with showing the now-famous Foreman knockout punches by Ali. The angles he uses are different with each punch, and it is a very good perspective.Other aspects of this film bothered me. For instance, was Ali REALLY on the phone with someone who was with MLK a second before he was assassinated ? That seems far-fetched to me.The only thing keeping this film from being a complete waste of film is Will Smith's performance here. Smith does indeed do everything that one can hope from someone who is portraying Ali. However, when you get right down to it, I think there are simply some people who it is more exciting to watch in a documentary or biography, rather than a Hollywood film production.So with that in mind, watch When We Were Kings for anything you would want to know about The Rumble in the Jungle or HBO's documentary on Ali-Frazier I. If you want a more interesting perspective on Ali's life in general, then watch ESPN's documentary on him - they didn't name him the Athlete of the Century for nothing.

What we have is this sorry catagory of movies that includes Critters 4 and is culminated in the awfulness that we call Jason X.The following sections of writing contains some SPOILERS! Yes, I said SPOILERS! So if you have yet to see this movie, and for some very sick reason you plan on watching the horror, please stop reading here because there are SPOILERS ahead.To me, there were only three slightly entertaining parts to the entire movie 1- the opening violence seen where he brakes loose and goes on the best all-round rampage of the whole move. 2- the part where he kills the doctor that was restoring him. When Jason put her head in the liquid nitrogen type substance and then preceeded to smash her frozen face on the table only to have it completely shatter, I thought that was the best use of gore in the film. 3- the sleeping bag scene. That was absolutely the funnist part of the movie, I fell over laughing. It was great, but it did not happen often enough to make Jason X worth seeing again because there were to many logical mistakes to not get upset with.LikeFirst of all, the whole field trip to Earth 1 is as dumb an idea as anybody with 14 braincells could come up with. Then, what do you think the odds are that the field trip happened to discover, of all things possible, the cryogenically frozen remains of Jason. So what do you think they do? A - leave the frozen man alone. or B - take him aboard their spaceship. Guess what? They thought no harm in choice B. Once on the ship, they actually run a DNA test and discover they identity of the ice man as Jason... and they defrost and reanimate him ANYWAY!! How stupid could they be? What did they expect? It does not matter because those idiots died the aweful deaths they deserved. Then, why not end this terrible movie with such a ridiculous finale that it leaves normal people cursing at the director? Once half of the ship blows up and Jason is floating in space, with NO OXYGEN might I add, he is somehow making his way toward the remaining part of the ship with the survivors, when he is just about to come in contact with the ship, a soldier that Jason maimed comes floating from Jason's side, also WITHOUT OXYGEN, and tackles him into the atmosphere where everything burns up EXCEPT the Mask.To summerize, the 11 entertaining minutes of the movie are not even close to making up for the rest of this disasterous project.

Jonathan E is a participant in a violent sport called Rollerball. He becomes so successful and popular that he begins to supersede the sport itself - comparisons in the twentieth century can be made to figures like Muhammad Ali or Michael Jordan. The corporations that run the world also run Rollerball and use it as a method of control. They see people's violent instincts as a threat to the status quo and use the sport as a social tranquiliser. As such, the game is excessively violent, the participants risking death. The spectators support their teams aggressively and frequently enter into near riots. When it's all over, they return to their homes and jobs, Rollerball having provided an outlet for their frustrations.Then things begin to go wrong. If Jonathan E becomes too popular, it threatens the efficiency of the mechanism. Rollerball must reflect the way society works - nobody can succeed as an individual.The heads of the corporations get nervous and decide to force Jonathan to retire. He doesn't understand why and refuses - as a consequence, they change the rules so that each match gets more and more deadly in the hope that he'll be killed and the anti-individualistic ethos will be restored. The more violent the games become, the more violent the spectators become...It's a thought provoking plot that makes one consider the role of television, sport and social control. It reminds me of what happened to Ali when he spoke out against the Vietnam war - the powers that be tried to discredit him. He scared them as he had so much influence on public opinion.Take a moment to consider the popularity of so called 'reality TV' shows like Survivor and Big Brother. Are they so different from what is depicted in this movie? Like Rollerball, their essential ingredient is human suffering. If we're truly honest, we want to see the people argue. It's even better when we get a closeup of the pain on their face right? If they need to go without food for a while to get to a stage where they're at eachother's throats - all the better. Sure - we all say we're not like that - but why do we watch?  It's an uncomfortable thought isn't it. To keep ratings high, the traumatic things the participants have to go through are getting worse and worse. How long will it be before national humiliation isn't enough to maintain the viewers interest? Does anybody really believe that the program makers wouldn't include shows with violent aspects if they thought they could get away with it?? What will reality TV be like in 20 years?The acting in the movie is excellent with James Caan, John Houseman and John Beck doing great jobs. Like the society in which they live, they come over as cold - distant. It's pitched just right.The sets are fantastic and are mostly real buildings that were specially selected to create the look. Again, they're sterile and perfectly put over what's going on.The cinematography is great, especially when we get to see the three Rollerball games. Closeups and fast cuts work well giving a good feeling of speed and brutality. The shots of the crowd are especially effective and look like a real riot (just look at real life scenes of soccer violence from here in the UK and you'll see the similarity.)To summarise, if you're a fan of 70's cinema or Sci-Fi, Rollerball is an absolute must. Some say the middle part of the film is boring, but if you watch properly and give it some thought, it's integral to the meaning of the whole picture. The three games of Rollerball are breathtaking and if you just like action movies, it's worth seeing just for those. With the new DVD giving it a fresh lease of life, it's well worth checking out.

I guess I can see why. It's so idiosyncratic, so loose, so out there, so...Altman. But this is truly one of the sweetest, gentlest, and most tender movies I have ever seen. This movie can be enjoyed if for no other reason than for its total lack of irony. Like Popeye, it is what it is. And I believe it to be a masterpiece. This was Robin Williams first serious movie role (2 full years before Garp) and he is a brilliant Popeye. He brings so much humanity and pathos to this character that it is easy to see the great movies in his future. Shelly Duval was born to play Olive Oyl and she does not squander the role of a lifetime. And in a smaller role, a standout performance is turned in Bill Irwin as Ham, Olive's bumbling, stumbling, clown of an ex-boyfriend. The real star of the show, however, is the atmosphere that Altman conjures up, bringing the 2d comic strip vividly to life and setting you down in this magical little island town of Sweet Haven. Harry Nilssons score is pitch perfect and his songs help to sketch out the characters motives and emotions (He Needs Me, sung by Duvall, is currently being revived thanks to it's being prominently featured in PT Anderson's Punch Drunk Love). One more thing about this movie- I can watch it with my three year old son and we sing the songs and both enjoy it immensely. There are so few movies that can do that. Like I said, a masterpiece!

Justin Whalin earned himself the number one position in my list of Worst Actors of All Times, beating even Chris O'Donnell to that position, and it should be said that this is the first time I ever saw him. Talk about a first impression. I cannot even put an adjective to his acting, as most of the time I found myself staring at the guy in shock. His presence must have rubbed off on Jeremy Irons, who really has no excuse for his participation in this disaster. Was he trying to have his last name changed to Irony? Unless he was being so ridiculously over the top on purpose, I cannot imagine what must have possessed him to act the way he did. Even the villains in the 60's Batman show were more subtle in their facial expression! The film gets one point for its dragons, though.

I enjoyed it.  It is a film with very few slow points and a fairly good cast, but it is typical and predictable.  I don't mind though.As many have said, 'Enough' seems as if it would be right at home over at Lifetime with all of the other battered wife flicks.  It's the typical film where husband doesn't turn out to be who we thought he was, wife tries to get away, husband catches her every time, wife then trains and gets all pumped up ready for revenge, and finally, wife DOES seek revenge more than likely killing the husband.  Oh, please, I knew that Mitch would be dead by the end after fifteen minutes of the film.  As predictable as it is, I still liked it, but oh, did they have to cast Jennifer Lopez?Jennifer Lopez is okay.  She was good in 'Selena', but I think that she should really stick to her musical career.  Lopez seems perfect for the role of Slim, yet she has a lot to work on.  Her acting is far from decent.  It's not that she's bad, because I've seen a lot worse, but she does need some practice.  Her 'ruggedness' is good for the movie and she does turn out to be pretty acceptable by the end.  For some reason I keep going back to Cameron Diaz for this role.  I don't know if she would have worked, but I don't think that it would have been that bad.  So, Lopez is okay, nothing great though.  This is the first time I had seen Billy Campbell in anything.  I must say that I was quite impressed with his acting.  He acted like a cruel husband, as he was supposed to, but he just seems so nice and caring that it's kind of hard to believe that he could be so mean.  Bottom line is that I would see him again in any of his other movies.  Tessa Allen was really cute and enjoyable.  Juliette Lewis is good as she always is. Noah Wyle.

Some things could have been better but were fine just the way they were.So, Billy Campbell as well as the others is really good, Jennifer Lopez goes through about a hundred wigs, the ending is predictable but interesting, and the film runs at a constant fast pace.

Some films I have a visceral dislike for because I feel that the director is either promoting an agenda, or simply being dishonest in presenting the material. One film that falls into this category is Safe by Todd Haynes. The film was made in 1995 and has received a great deal of praise.Safe features an outstanding performance by Julianne Moore, and does well to express the sense of unease and dislocation that many people experience in the modern urban world. The movie begins with Moore's character, Carol, coming into an awareness of the emptiness of her life. At a dinner party scene early in the film we see that behind the laughter and amiable conversation surrounding her, Carol feels isolated and afraid. She has little sense of who she or of what is meaningful to her. She finds herself coughing and experiencing sudden fits of dizziness and nausea and we are meant to wonder what is wrong. The question is compelling; at one point it is suggested that Carol is simply allergic to the 20th century. Unfortunately the film really slips up when Haynes takes us to Act Two.Carol abandons her home and family and takes refuge in the chemical-free zone of Wrenwood, a healing facility out in the desert. She wants to retreat from the whole world. Wrenwood is presented as a New Age cult, run by the slick Peter Dunning (Peter Friedman) who is infected with AIDS. In the words of reviewer Steven Shaviro, He (Peter) encourages Carol to look inward, into herself. Her selfhood is as carefully nourished in Wrenwood as it was denied at home. You yourself are responsible for your illness, Peter tells her. If you got sick, it's because on some level you chose to. If you want to get well, shut your eyes and ears to everything from outside. Purge away those negative feelings, and give yourself to love. Learn to cherish and love yourself, and everything will be fine. However, Carol does not progress but gets worse. She loses all sense of her identity, and at the end of the film is as lost regarding her sickness as at the beginning.The problem I have with the film is not so much that Wrenwood fails to help Carol, or even that the group is portrayed negatively. What I object to is the casual way that Haynes recycles the worst cliches and falsehoods regarding self-help movements, and to my mind, est in particular. Peter Dunning is portrayed as a slick phony, praying on people's insecurities with a combination of charisma and empty pieties. It follows that Wrenwood's participants are dupes, brainwashed, taken advantage of. In my personal experience, the goal of these programs was to transform people so that they could experience themselves and the people around them fully, with love and with joy. The fact that over a million people participated in est and in similar movements attests to the fact that, in the main, people got value from them and shared it with people they cared about.Because Haynes uses ideas that have a direct basis in reality, there is a burden to be honest about what these movements stood for and practiced. Yet, Haynes' approach is cynical and fundamentally dishonest. The truth is that no one in any of the self-help programs I was familiar with ever told anyone anything such as Peter tells Carol. Many came to similar conclusions but only through looking inward and discovering the truth for themselves.Haynes failure in portraying the group at Wrenwood is problematic not only ethically, but finally, and perhaps most important, dramatically. Watching this section of the film, one senses that Haynes is not truly invested in the journey of his protagonist; rather, he is leading Carol around like a puppet through events contrived to enforce his own attitude toward self-help groups. The action falls flat, as the film becomes nothing more than a moody demonstration of cliched and profoundly false assumptions. A serious issue such as the one Haynes has developed in the beginning of the film demands a serious exploration. Safe never follows through on its intriguing premise.

They fell in love of course and dated for a while but soon Whitman's personality began to become increasingly worrying and the relationship came to an end.  However as Martha finds, Whitman won't let her sabotage her won happiness.I knew that this film would be a romantic comedy without a great plot and would probably not be that good.  However I had hoped that it would have enough wit and energy to it to be fun if not brilliant.  However it is actually a bit dopey and really drags along with no fun whatsoever.  The film premiered in the UK on channel 5 in the middle of the afternoon schedule of soaps and bad chat shows &#150; that is how much they thought of the rights to this movie.The plot is really poor &#150; basically Whitman can't accept he's been dumped and starts to freak out Martha.  It does nothing funny with this premise whatsoever and it just gets increasingly desperate as it tries to be `wacky' and `off the wall'.  Instead I found it tiresome and just plain unfunny.  It didn't even seem to be trying hard &#150; it just seemed content to drag it's feet as it went along.  Whitman isn't sold as a stalker of any kind and his actions aren't ever explained as they finally go a bit extreme.  It ain't funny, it ain't romantic and it left me wondering what the point of it was.I like DeGeneres even though I know she's rubbish.  She does occasionally get some laughs in a poor vehicle.  Here she did nothing and if anything just made the film worse!  Pullman is usually good in anything he does but he has nothing to work with in a character who is never really given any foundation or basis.  The rest of the cast are simply TV support actors which suits the feel of this film. Oh, and special mention to Joan Cusack &#150; what a terrible performance and a terrible career choice!  Fire your agent.Overall this was a waste of 90 minutes and it really felt like it was twice as long as this.  It has no natural energy and it just drags along.  It is the least funny thing I have ever seen Ellen in.....and that's saying something.
