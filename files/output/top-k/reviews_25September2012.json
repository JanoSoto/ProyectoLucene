And it's not just different but also most definitely less effective. There is not as much tension and mystery in this one, also due to some pacing issues (it's too fast paced at times) and a poor buildup to things.And all while this movie in essence is still being just like the original.

The screenplay was adapted by Christopher Kyle, based on a story written by Louis Nowra.Captain Alexi Vostrikov is a Russian naval officer who's being given command of the Soviet Union's first nuclear submarine, K-19, at the height of the Cold War in 1961. The vessel's previous commander, Captain Mikhail Polenin has been demoted to executive officer following a botched test and his outspoken assertions that the flagship is not yet ready for deployment, but he curbs his resentment and resolves to serve his new superior well. The former commander has concerns that are well founded parts are not yet installed, equipment is missing, and the ship's doctor is killed in an auto mishap. Political pressure forces Vostrikov to sail his crew into the North Atlantic anyway, for a missile fire test that serves as a warning to the U.S. that its enemy is now its technological equal. The test is a success, but a disastrous leak in the K-19's reactor cooling system soon threatens to create enough heat to detonate the craft's nuclear payload wherein would certainly be mistaken for the first salvo in a worldwide atomic exchange and spark the beginning of World War III.

Maybe that's why Hell House is more or less considered the best of the lot. Now, I don't want to attack the film gratuitously, but I have some problems with it. Generally speaking, Hell house is a creepy, well made little film, but the script by Richard Matheson -and his novel, which shares the same problems- is just smoke and mirrors.My main issue with the film is that it seems to promise a scientific approach to the haunted house cliché.

And Wall Street', although carrying the mark of the 80's hasn't lost one ounce of relevance in 25 years.The script itself is full of universal aphorisms and historical references justifying that either greed, for lack of a better word is good or that the rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. Finance divides the worlds into categories, 1% that owns half the wealth, and the poor exploited schmucks. That's how it worked, works and will always work. And it's impossible to review the film without thinking of the 'Occupy Wall Street' movement or a figure like Bernie Madoff who reduces Gordon Gekko to the level of a three-card trick player.Stone said he wanted to make Wall Street because he's always been shocked by the 25-30 year old golden boys who accumulated lifetime fortunes from speculation, epitomizing the most pervert aspect of the American Dream and caricaturing the notion of self-made-men to the extreme. The possibility to get wealthy without creating wealth is not just the most hideous face of capitalism that Stone unveils; it's the core of Gordon Gekko's behavior, a modern illustration of the law of the jungle. Money is not created, only transferred, and it's a zero - sum game where you either win or lose. By this admission, Gekko belies his own tribute to greed as a driving value because greed drives nothing but one's own egoism.Wall Street works as ferocious and eye-opening journey into a rotten system seen through the sparkling eyes of a young newcomer, Buddy Fox (Charlie Sheen), a broker in a Wall Street firm and Gordon Gekko's number one fan. Fox grew up in a modest family and his father Carl, played by Martin Sheen, is a mechanic and union leader who tried to inculcate values in total opposition with Gekko's. Gekko, in fact, can't consider any value that doesn't end with a dollar sign. It's precisely Fox's poverty that drove his voracious appetite, contradicting the archetype of inner nobility in poverty. And it's obvious that the Gekko-Fox duo, despite the bestial connection, plays on a father-and-son relationship as Gekko recognizes himself in Fox.Once he gets to Gekko's office, Fox knows he's given a lifetime opportunity, and plays his card well by providing resourceful information for Gekko. And Gekko is not just a mentor for the sake of it, he uses Fox to flatter his ego and his portfolio, which are both gigantic. But the price for Fox is to renounce his ethics and principles. By breaking financial secrets, Fox sells his soul, and never has the 'deal with the devil' expression been so literal. The price he put is illustrated in the following sequence a success montage that finds the right balance between looking appealing and appalling, over the top in every meaning of the word.Fox gets a new apartment, decorated by Darlene, a fittingly tall, blonde and beautiful girl from Gekko's inner circle. The film reveals its only real handicap with the casting of Daryl Hannah, who looks in a perpetual inner conflict with the superficiality of her character. Nevertheless, the scene where she decorates the apartment mostly with fake furniture shows how far we can get in bad taste and ugliness in the name of flashy newness. It's an interesting parenthesis against modern art and the design that characterized the decadence of the 80's, consisting on filling emptiness with the weirdest, ugliest stuff that even Gekko, who buys aesthetically limited paintings, fail to grasp.And Fox embraces the 'all flash and no substance' mentality in both his work and private life, getting further and further from his roots, the price to pay his principles, his father's respect, the reward money, admiration, job promotion, and the blonde girl. What Fox lives is schematically pure Scarface wisdom once you get the money, you get the power, and when you get the power, you get the women, it's not just a critic of the perverse effects of the American Dream but of a system that tolerates men like Gekko. The difference between Scarface and Wall Street is that the central character paid the high price for his greed, while Fox is given a chance to redeem himself, a necessary step in his initiation.

Pistone, an FBI undercover agent who infiltrated the Bonanno crime family in New York City during the 1970s, under the alias Donnie Brasco, aka, The Jewel Man.It was directed by Mike Newell.Joe Pistone is an FBI agent who is given an assignment to infiltrate the Mafia; calling himself Donnie Brasco, he befriends Lefty Ruggiero , a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters. Lefty's marriage is falling apart, his son is a junkie, and his health is failing, which only adds to his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years with the Mafia with little to show for it. But in Donnie, Lefty sees someone who can succeed where he failed; he takes the young man under his wing, and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly rises through the ranks of organized crime.However,as Donnie moves deeper into the Mafia, he realizes that not only is he crossing the line between federal agent and criminal, but also leading his friend Lefty to an almost certain death.It also drives a wedge between himself and his wife and children, and he realizes that a break in character among the hoodlums he's come to know could mean a death sentence for himself and his family. Just as importantly, Joe has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend, and Joe realizes that when the day comes where he has to turn in his Mob associates, he'll be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he put a slug in his head himself.This is a first-class Mafia thriller.No question about it.First of all,the performances were nothing but spectacular.Pacino and Depp are a match made in acting heaven, riffing off each other with astonishing subtlety and wit.Also, is like a de-romanticized, de-mythologized version of The Godfather as it offers an uncommonly detailed, privileged glimpse inside the world of organized crime from the perspective of the little guys at the bottom of Mafia hierarchy rather than from the kingpins at the top. This not only one of the great modern-day gangster movies to put in the company of The Godfather films and GoodFellas, but it is also one of the great undercover police movies probably even surpassing Serpico and Prince of the City with respect to richness of character, detail, and moral complexity.In summary,it is a gangster movie that succeeds on all levels.Highly recommended indeed.

Lefty's marriage is falling apart, his son is a junkie, and his health is failing, which only adds to his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years with the Mafia with little to show for it. But in Donnie, Lefty sees someone who can succeed where he failed; he takes the young man under his wing, and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly rises through the ranks of organized crime.However,as Donnie moves deeper into the Mafia, he realizes that not only is he crossing the line between federal agent and criminal, but also leading his friend Lefty to an almost certain death.It also drives a wedge between himself and his wife and children, and he realizes that a break in character among the hoodlums he's come to know could mean a death sentence for himself and his family. Just as importantly, Joe has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend, and Joe realizes that when the day comes where he has to turn in his Mob associates, he'll be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he put a slug in his head himself.This is a first-class Mafia thriller.No question about it.First of all,the performances were nothing but spectacular.Pacino and Depp are a match made in acting heaven, riffing off each other with astonishing subtlety and wit.Also, is like a de-romanticized, de-mythologized version of The Godfather as it offers an uncommonly detailed, privileged glimpse inside the world of organized crime from the perspective of the little guys at the bottom of Mafia hierarchy rather than from the kingpins at the top. This not only one of the great modern-day gangster movies to put in the company of The Godfather films and GoodFellas, but it is also one of the great undercover police movies probably even surpassing Serpico and Prince of the City with respect to richness of character, detail, and moral complexity.In summary,it is a gangster movie that succeeds on all levels.Highly recommended indeed.

Just when you thought no explosion would ever surprise you, Lethal Weapon 2 is remembered as the one where Murtaugh is trapped with a bomb in his toilet, although I found the explosive diving board more shocking and disturbing.When you thought you had 'good' bad guys in the first, wait until you meet the villains in Lethal Weapon 2, the mastermind is Arjen Rudd, the ministry of affairs for the South African consulate, played by Joss Ackland and his hit-man, the slimy and evil Vorstedt (Derrick O'Connor). To give you a glimpse of their level of evilness, not only they belong to the government that was practicing segregation (the apartheid still existed in 1989) but they use their diplomatic immunity as a bullet-proof vest to cover some cold-blooded killings, among other malevolent actions.You have villains who not only kill but can't get killed and if I said that Hans Gruber from Die Hard was slightly superior to Mr. Joshua, it's like the writers finally understood that vileness could be scarier, more effective and more infuriating when it uses the appearance of respectability, like when you have a bunch of LAPD officers pointing their guns at them, on the verge of a successful arrest, and then are forced to leave. The comparison with Nazis through the 'Master Race' insult is a historical shortcut but not necessarily irrelevant regarding the context, but the film cleverly avoids a blind Manichaeism by inserting the character of Rika, a young South-African secretary who doesn't approve everything from her country.And through Rika, it's two birds hit by one stone, because she and Riggs fall in love, and trust the script that it's not a romantic subplot for the sake of it. Everything has a purpose in Lethal Weapon 2 and serves as a build-up for a final confrontation that would be ten times more spectacular, thrilling, violent and emotionally driven than the first opus. And we all know how a formulaic or conventional climax can ruin even the greatest action films. I remember I gave a positive review for Commando but the climax of Lethal Weapon 2 would almost make me reconsider my opinion. Anyway, the writers know that the more you'll hate the bad guys, the more you'll cheer at their demise.And it works indeed. Martin Riggs will be enraged as he's never been and Murtaugh himself, who plays the good cop, or the too-old-for-this attitude, can't let the bad guys get away with some crimes they committed. Well, let's just summarize the whole film, otherwise, I would end up spoiling it, the script makes the final confrontation personal, so personal than the last bullet shot and the line that accompanies it is the perfect pay-off to all the little bits that angered us. And although it's an overused line, the 'this time, it's personal' never resonates as something cheesy and forced. We're so engaged with Riggs and Murtaugh, that we share their laughs and joys as much as their sadness and fury.Besides, personal is a word I like when it comes to the Lethal Weapon series because the action, as spectacular as it always is, never distracts from the motives, from what goes through Riggs and Murtaugh's hearts and minds, and the plot's center of gravity their relationships. In Lethal Weapon, they had to know each other to get along, in Lethal Weapon 2, they're inseparable and even their constant disagreement is the cement of their complicity. The toilet-bomb scene manages to distract us from the comical aspect of Murtaugh's position through some genuine interaction. At one point, Murtaugh, wants to say something to Riggs, no word is spoken but Riggs understands, and so do we, that's friendship at its best and we understand them because in a way, they also became our friends.Naturally, we find Riggs and Murtaugh in their opposite lifestyles, Murtaugh's family has grown up and one of the film's running gags concern a condom ad where Rihanne acted, Riggs still live in a trailer in the beach with his dog, Sam, he still loves the Three Stooges. The power of a sequel is to create newness with old material, but Lethal Weapon 2 doesn't take it for granted, yes there is some Riggs and Murtaugh of the first opus in the opening car chase, but it would have been tiresome had it lasted the whole film. Lethal Weapon 2 didn't recycle the same kind of interactions for different situations but rather featured different interactions for similar situations, and the strike of genius from the writers is the insertion of Joe Pesci's character Leo Getz, a crooked accountant who blew the whistle about his client's money-laundering activities.Riggs and Murtaugh are assigned to protect him, and then the duo becomes trio. Pesci plays a small, loudmouthed, annoying character, punctuating his sentences with so many OK OK OK OK the only answer you want to give him is Shut up! along with some pinching and slapping. But far from being a simple comic relief, Leo consolidates the two characters' interaction by giving them a same target and happens to be indirectly linked to the bad guys, so in his own way irritating way, he's so significant that it's impossible to imagine the film, let alone the franchise, without him.It's obvious to me that Lethal Weapon 2 captures the magic of the original film with such efficiency it would less qualify as a sequel than as a continuation of the level of greatness initiated by the first, and I'm not even exaggerating because whatever made Lethal Weapon memorable is twice as great in the second opus.

Though it doesn't necessarily imply that the following step is marriage, but we can bet on a long-term commitment.Basically, Four Weddings and a Funeral stands above all the 'romantic comedy' genre because it doesn't take its very essence for granted and turns into a delightful social commentary about the meaning of marital commitment even questioning its compatibility with real love. Can love last for life? If not definite answers, the film provides some hints through four martial experiences and one funeral, which is an occasion to think about life and death. Mike Newell finds the perfect balance between humor, slapstick and intelligence, all of them in a typically British flavor.And one thing for sure, the film's title doesn't lie about the content since the five titular events and their direct aftermaths occupy almost 95% of the screen time. And as viewers, we're (literally) invited to follow the adventures of one joyful bunch of friends. On the top of them, there's Hugh Grant as Charles, a handsome thirty something bachelor whose penetrating blue eyes betray a vulnerable sensitivity that doesn't fit his look. There is the tiny, exuberant Charlotte Coleman as Scarlett, a gay couple, Matthew (John Hannah) and Garrett played by the scene-stealing Simon Callow. Kristin Scott Thomas plays Fiona, hiding in a sophisticated composure the grief of never having conquered Charles' heart, and last but not least, there's Tom, Jack Fleet as the goofiest and clumsiest of the bunch, which is saying a lot.We never know exactly what these people do for a living, but it doesn't matter actually. Besides, we know them enough to understand the way they feel, behave or approach life and important matters, so the rest would only fill the script with unnecessary details. Have you noticed by the way that in most rom-coms, the jobs of the two lead hardly play a role, one is an architect, and another is a cook, so what? And have you also noticed that many romantic comedies only rely on the believability of its lead couple and some supporting characters, Four Weddings and a Funeral is an ensemble cast movie, and even more effective because it doesn't depend on a multi-linear plot, the solidarity, the complicity between the friends is the story's heart and greatest source for gags and amusement.I insist on the ensemble cast because truth is if Hugh Grant was perfect for the role that put him in America's showbiz map, and earned him a Golden Globe, the same can hardly be said about Andie McDowell. As much as I respect and appreciate the actress, it's hard to see the same sweetheart who turned Phil Connor's heart in Groundhog Day. She doesn't deliver a bad performance per se, but a Razzie nomination (that thankfully the film was spared of) wouldn't have surprised me. It was hard to believe that Charles would be so infatuated in a woman who doesn't seem quite sure either about love, let alone marriage. Some would think this is what united them since they would be involved in the two weddings that didn't end. But something in Carrie suggested that she was more of a gold-digger type, while Charles is more a victim of his own idealism.Unsuccessful marriages end up being more insightful than the others, (if only because they do 'end up') and one of the merit of Four Weddings and a Funeral is to put the notion of commitment into perspective, to revalue the meaning of living and loving someone for life. In a way, the subtext is that we are never 100% sure to love someone then marriage is not necessarily a guarantee of happiness OR if we really love one person, then marriage would be totally meaningless. That's the idea conveyed by Gareth and Matthew's who'd be shown as the most solid and sincere couple, without any ceremony to 'validate' their union. The death of Gareth invites for these questions and works as a great dramatic relief in a relatively screwball comedy, thanks to Matthew's powerful eulogy, simple but realistically heart-breaking.But I guess I was a bit too serious in my review, and beyond the whole introspective facade, Four Weddings and a Funeral is also a cheerful celebration of the most special day of anyone's life, the day we have to say 'yes', this magical moment that sets a before and an after in our lives, that starts with solemnity and ends up with fun, alcohol, and maybe a few years later, regrets. It also allows other people to meet their match, soul-mates or one-night hits. Weddings are the premise of countless jokes, a nice twist on the forget-the-rings gag, embarrassing best man's speeches, some acts of pure desperation and a wonderfully comic moment with Rowan Atkinson as a priest in his first wedding. His five minutes are funnier than the whole 'Mr. Bean' film, in fact, the film reminds us that the world needs marriage, if only to have a great moment of fun and joy.Four Weddings and one Funeral was one of the biggest hits of the glorious 1994, earning two nominations for Best Screenplay and Best Picture. The material is so fresh and new on the field of romantic comedies that it's hard to tolerate such conventional moments like a declaration of love under the rain, and a cheesy line delivered by you-know-who, and it's only forgivable because the film immediately redeems itself through the great ending credits sequence and Elton John's version of Chapel of Love, the credits sequences perfectly captures the positive, optimistic mood of the film, and even its not-to-be-taken-so-seriously quality.And it does fit the general message of the film that after all, maybe wedding, just like life, is not to be taken so seriously, and maybe that's the best way to make it work.

Kristin Scott Thomas plays Fiona, hiding in a sophisticated composure the grief of never having conquered Charles' heart, and last but not least, there's Tom, Jack Fleet as the goofiest and clumsiest of the bunch, which is saying a lot.We never know exactly what these people do for a living, but it doesn't matter actually. Besides, we know them enough to understand the way they feel, behave or approach life and important matters, so the rest would only fill the script with unnecessary details. Have you noticed by the way that in most rom-coms, the jobs of the two lead hardly play a role, one is an architect, and another is a cook, so what? And have you also noticed that many romantic comedies only rely on the believability of its lead couple and some supporting characters, Four Weddings and a Funeral is an ensemble cast movie, and even more effective because it doesn't depend on a multi-linear plot, the solidarity, the complicity between the friends is the story's heart and greatest source for gags and amusement.I insist on the ensemble cast because truth is if Hugh Grant was perfect for the role that put him in America's showbiz map, and earned him a Golden Globe, the same can hardly be said about Andie McDowell. As much as I respect and appreciate the actress, it's hard to see the same sweetheart who turned Phil Connor's heart in Groundhog Day. She doesn't deliver a bad performance per se, but a Razzie nomination (that thankfully the film was spared of) wouldn't have surprised me. It was hard to believe that Charles would be so infatuated in a woman who doesn't seem quite sure either about love, let alone marriage. Some would think this is what united them since they would be involved in the two weddings that didn't end. But something in Carrie suggested that she was more of a gold-digger type, while Charles is more a victim of his own idealism.Unsuccessful marriages end up being more insightful than the others, (if only because they do 'end up') and one of the merit of Four Weddings and a Funeral is to put the notion of commitment into perspective, to revalue the meaning of living and loving someone for life. In a way, the subtext is that we are never 100% sure to love someone then marriage is not necessarily a guarantee of happiness OR if we really love one person, then marriage would be totally meaningless. That's the idea conveyed by Gareth and Matthew's who'd be shown as the most solid and sincere couple, without any ceremony to 'validate' their union. The death of Gareth invites for these questions and works as a great dramatic relief in a relatively screwball comedy, thanks to Matthew's powerful eulogy, simple but realistically heart-breaking.But I guess I was a bit too serious in my review, and beyond the whole introspective facade, Four Weddings and a Funeral is also a cheerful celebration of the most special day of anyone's life, the day we have to say 'yes', this magical moment that sets a before and an after in our lives, that starts with solemnity and ends up with fun, alcohol, and maybe a few years later, regrets. It also allows other people to meet their match, soul-mates or one-night hits. Weddings are the premise of countless jokes, a nice twist on the forget-the-rings gag, embarrassing best man's speeches, some acts of pure desperation and a wonderfully comic moment with Rowan Atkinson as a priest in his first wedding. His five minutes are funnier than the whole 'Mr. Bean' film, in fact, the film reminds us that the world needs marriage, if only to have a great moment of fun and joy.Four Weddings and one Funeral was one of the biggest hits of the glorious 1994, earning two nominations for Best Screenplay and Best Picture. The material is so fresh and new on the field of romantic comedies that it's hard to tolerate such conventional moments like a declaration of love under the rain, and a cheesy line delivered by you-know-who, and it's only forgivable because the film immediately redeems itself through the great ending credits sequence and Elton John's version of Chapel of Love, the credits sequences perfectly captures the positive, optimistic mood of the film, and even its not-to-be-taken-so-seriously quality.And it does fit the general message of the film that after all, maybe wedding, just like life, is not to be taken so seriously, and maybe that's the best way to make it work.

Based on the popular 60's TV show, THE FUGITIVE works on so many levels that it's easy to see why it became a hit when originally released and why it remains so popular nearly twenty-years later. I think the greatest thing that the film has going for it is that it basically works as two very good films rolled into one. The first forty-five minutes or so we're given a terrific action film that starts off with an introduction to the murder and conviction of the doctor and then we go full steam into the intense action. We get a terrific train-bus wreck, which is still impressive all these years later and right from here we go for faster action as we see Kimble trying to evade the police and the U.S. Marshall. These scenes are full of wonderful action but the way Andrew Davis keeps the suspense building is where the true magic is. The second half of the film sees a little less action as we find the doctor doing the investigating trying to figure out who killed his wife. Both sequences work so well and especially when you mix them together as you really get a complete film. It also doesn't hurt that you've got two great performances. Ford could play this type of role in his sleep but I still don't think he got enough credit. He's really not playing an action hero here, I mean, serious, he gets beaten by a one-armed man. He really plays a doctor here who must go beyond his normal limits to try and clear his name and I thought Ford did a great job with it. There's no question, however, that the film belongs to Jones who rightfully picked up the Best Supporting Oscar for his work here. I really loved the comic timing that Jones brought the film and I thought this humor really helped make the film so memorable. The highlight for me has to be the scene where a woman is screaming uncontrollably and Jones simply tells her to shut up. Joe Pantoliano, Sela Ward and a briefly scene Julianne Moore are also good in their parts. THE FUGITIVE ends in a way you'd expect it to but there's still no question that it's a tense little thriller that works on most levels.

A low budget British movie, packed full of gore, torture and grisly images, it sounds like just the kind of film that gets made and then disappears only to be rediscovered by horror geeks some twenty years later. Not so. There's something about HELLRAISER that stands it head and shoulders above the rest, and that thing is the presence of writer\/director Clive Barker. Barker brings a level of originality and visceral intensity to this film that raises it to the heights of similar fare like Wes Craven's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.The story is overshadowed by the presence of Pinhead and his fellow demons, each of them an S&M-influenced being who delights in causing pain and suffering. However, the main thrust of the film isn't actually about Pinhead and pals at all; instead, it's about the ultra-creepy and depraved character Uncle Frank and his destruction of an otherwise ordinary family. Uncle Frank is truly one of the most sickening and twisted creations in cinema and the thought of him hiding in that attic room is enough to give anyone chills, I imagine.In any case, this is a solid and eventful film; it's action packed, fast-paced and witty with it. The characters (especially the ones you love to hate) are well observed and the horror comes thick and fast, presented in a matter-of-fact, in-your-face fashion.

To play a person of his magnitude certainly requires ambition and drive but also talent and diversity. Jones tackles the player with the hatred and evilness that many archived articles and reports have claimed he proudly wore with piercing accuracy.Today, in 2012, baseball players are often viewed as heroes, role models, and sometimes even people who provide us with more motivation and passion than those we know in real life. Players like Starlin Castro, Alfonso Soriano, and Jim Thome have etched themselves into the hearts of many. Cobb would've etched himself in the dark side of someone's heart. He was a racist, sexist, selfish, mean-spirited, cocky, gun-toting ignoramus who hated everyone except himself. He thought of himself as the sport of baseball, completely shunning teamwork and thoroughly enjoyed being hated by literally everyone in the audience. He thought the fact that they showed up to the stadium to throw food and garbage on him was the highest compliment someone could pay.The film centers around not his baseball career, but how a famed sportswriter had the questionably fortunate opportunity to dig into Cobb as a real person in 1959. That man was Al Stump (Robert Wuhl), who was hired to act as a ghostwriter for Cobb's autobiography. Initially, Stump is incredibly honored and thrilled to be given such a job, being able to spend days and nights with the best baseball player of all time. But when Stump arrives, he is immediately greeted with loud rants from a writer who walks on him and we eventually see Cobb, as he lies in bed, frail and uninspired, verbally assaulting the poor man as he tries to simply reason with him and remain civil.Cobb suggests that him and Stump drive down to Reno to have sex with random women - an act he hopes to accomplish before he dies. He insists on driving recklessly through a terrible blizzard and, as he slips and slides down the road, Cobb briefly illustrates his baseball history for Al.You'd believe the film was told entirely in flashback, but the flashback ceases only after a few minutes and we are back in the present with Al and Cobb, and that's where we remain for the remainder of the picture. It is widely known that Stump published a book shortly after spending days on end with Cobb, but that was the fabricated version he was conned into writing for the man, which the film heavily explores. Al secretly kept a real recollection of his treatment and relationship with the man, but resorted to scribbling notes on cocktail napkins, small pieces of paper, etc. He then released a book detailing the true accounts of the man years after his death - accounts that are depicted in this film.Ron Shelton's Cobb is far from a perfect biopic. It's a little choppy, somewhat dry in sequences, and may run twenty minutes too long, but the fact that it humanizes an unbelievably despicable character, is written with little tongue in cheek innuendos, and the fact that it showcases many honorable performances makes it one that proves its existence nicely.Starring Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Wuhl, and Lolita Davidovich.

It's a little choppy, somewhat dry in sequences, and may run twenty minutes too long, but the fact that it humanizes an unbelievably despicable character, is written with little tongue in cheek innuendos, and the fact that it showcases many honorable performances makes it one that proves its existence nicely.Starring Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Wuhl, and Lolita Davidovich. Directed by Ron Shelton. ","genre":"Biography, Drama, Sport"},{"date":"25 September 2012","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Tommy Lee Jones may not look much like the infamous ballplayer Ty Cobb, but he sure does embody his spirit, hatred, and consistent belligerence wonderfully. To play a person of his magnitude certainly requires ambition and drive but also talent and diversity. Jones tackles the player with the hatred and evilness that many archived articles and reports have claimed he proudly wore with piercing accuracy.Today, in 2012, baseball players are often viewed as heroes, role models, and sometimes even people who provide us with more motivation and passion than those we know in real life. Players like Starlin Castro, Alfonso Soriano, and Jim Thome have etched themselves into the hearts of many. Cobb would've etched himself in the dark side of someone's heart. He was a racist, sexist, selfish, mean-spirited, cocky, gun-toting ignoramus who hated everyone except himself. He thought of himself as the sport of baseball, completely shunning teamwork and thoroughly enjoyed being hated by literally everyone in the audience. He thought the fact that they showed up to the stadium to throw food and garbage on him was the highest compliment someone could pay.The film centers around not his baseball career, but how a famed sportswriter had the questionably fortunate opportunity to dig into Cobb as a real person in 1959. That man was Al Stump (Robert Wuhl), who was hired to act as a ghostwriter for Cobb's autobiography. Initially, Stump is incredibly honored and thrilled to be given such a job, being able to spend days and nights with the best baseball player of all time. But when Stump arrives, he is immediately greeted with loud rants from a writer who walks on him and we eventually see Cobb, as he lies in bed, frail and uninspired, verbally assaulting the poor man as he tries to simply reason with him and remain civil.Cobb suggests that him and Stump drive down to Reno to have sex with random women - an act he hopes to accomplish before he dies. He insists on driving recklessly through a terrible blizzard and, as he slips and slides down the road, Cobb briefly illustrates his baseball history for Al.You'd believe the film was told entirely in flashback, but the flashback ceases only after a few minutes and we are back in the present with Al and Cobb, and that's where we remain for the remainder of the picture. It is widely known that Stump published a book shortly after spending days on end with Cobb, but that was the fabricated version he was conned into writing for the man, which the film heavily explores. Al secretly kept a real recollection of his treatment and relationship with the man, but resorted to scribbling notes on cocktail napkins, small pieces of paper, etc. He then released a book detailing the true accounts of the man years after his death - accounts that are depicted in this film.Ron Shelton's Cobb is far from a perfect biopic.

I believe a similar diagnosis can be made about the two lead characters of Rain Man, Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) because he's autistic, and his brother Charlie, 25 years younger, because he's a young yuppie blinded by his own ego. Both live in their world, both are their own referential; naturally, they're put in a situation where they have to interact. Rain Man features one of the most intriguing premises of the 80's, and although the film never strikes as a 'masterpiece', not even in style, it does deliver the emotional pay-off we all expect without recycling old archetypes or falling into sentimental trap.Should I describe Raymond Babbit's condition? Those who know already have in mind his mimics, head-banging, 'uh-oh', his addictions to such TV programs as Judge Wapner and The Wheel of Fortune and his perfect recitation of Abbots and Costello's 'Who's on first' routine when he's uncomfortable. And to those who haven't, it's enough saying that Dustin Hoffman surpasses himself, if it ever was possible after performances of the caliber of Tootsie or Midnight Cowboy. He's unbelievably convincing, capable to transcend the limits of acting. To win an Oscar for a rather one-note character is an exploit even more impressive because Hoffman manages to pull some human complexity in Raymond, making him absolutely endearing and adorable yet frustrating and scary. Raymond is a character we want to love without turning it into pity.On the other hand, his brother Charlie is the total counterpart, young, handsome, he's a self-made man who exploited a passion for cars to sell imported vehicles. Even his girlfriend, played by the beautiful Valeria Golino is Italian, like a foreign beautiful possession, a trophy that elevates him above the others. Charlie Babbit is a character who flirts with the archetype of the young and arrogant go-getter, a role tailor-made for an actor like Tom Cruise, especially in the 80's. The talent of Cruise consists on making his character unlovable enough to laugh at his misfortunes with Raymond, but human enough to feel sad for him when he learns about his father's death, and much more, when he learns that he didn't get one cent from him, while he was full of debts. Charlie is a character we want to hate but end up giving him the benefit of the doubt.And Charlie is so blinded by his financial problems that he's incapable to care for Raymond and take his medical condition into consideration; all he sees in him is the guy who inherited three millions from his father. At this point, I suspect the screenwriter immediately thought 'hey, in fact, Raymond is medically autistic, while Charlie is symbolically autistic; let's see if the viewers will figure that'. I don't think it takes a degree in psychoanalysis to jump to that conclusion. Anyone would see the kidnapping of Raymond coming. Naturally, the girlfriend leave them to let the adventure begin between the two brothers and both would learn how to communicate &#x85; not. This is where the odd-couple\/road movie formula stops. The strength of Rain Man is to never make Raymond change, no miracle cure, no sudden change of behavior, if there is one who's up to change, it's Charlie. And he must change, otherwise, the whole premise of the film is pointless.The quality of Barry Levinson's film is to make a predictable turn of events work remaining believable, it also grabs our interest without an abundance of spectacular scenes, or overused emotion. It's always interesting to see a character with leadership quality, handsome and somewhat charismatic, pushed to follow an autistic man and having to deal with out-of-control situations. Charlie wants to take Raymond in L.A, but they can't because Raymond is afraid of planes, and when Raymond starts screaming in panic, Charlie understands that the road trip will follow Raymond's parameters of life. In a way, Raymond Babbit is a leading role because he leads the story. And by following Raymond, Charlie will get to know more about his brother's sensitivity and become more empathic, a word he knew nothing about. The narrative progresses and provides the film's greatest twist, when Charlie realizes he can use Raymond's savant skills.Till now, the film is mostly remembered for the 'Las Vegas' sequence and the iconic moment when the two brothers stand on a descending escalator wearing the same suit, and the last step between Charlie and Raymond's reconciliation, a clever partnership for a rewarding pay-off. It's obvious that Charlie was mostly motivated by greed, but it's impossible not to see genuine attachment growing between Cruise and Hoffman. Both had failure to communicate their feelings, but it's by inviting his brother to communicate his inner thoughts, his fears and desires that Charlie learned the process of listening, of using another referential than his, of being capable of giving and understanding. The film follows the traditional coming-of-realization structure, and on that level, Tom Cruise never makes his changing obvious and spectacular. Indeed, both actors are so good, almost equally, because it was to Cruise to portray anger and frustration without making it forced or over the top.Without Hoffman and Cruise, I can't imagine the film having the same impact. Yes, the screenplay is well-written, and Hans Zimmer's score has a haunting effect, but it's definitely an actors' film. It ended up winning the Best Picture Oscar in 1988, which is quite surprising considering how simple and non-Best Picture material it feels, but it did created a genuine interest for autistic condition, and featured many memorable scenes, and I guess sometimes, that's enough to touch the hearts.
