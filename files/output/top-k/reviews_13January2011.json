Lenny is posthumously regarded as the father of stand-up comedy and this movie directed by Bob Fosse, is a deserved homage to the unsung hero of a shameful fight for freedom of speech. Who else but Bob Fosse, the director who's to entertainment what Hitchcock is to suspense, could have made such a riveting movie about a comic performer ? And who else but Dustin Hoffman could have personified this prodigious comical talent and his heart-breaking fight for dignity in such a haunting performance ?Lenny is about entertainment in its most difficult, underestimated but noblest form, comedy. And by noble, it means 'most sincere' because laughs are the most spontaneous emotions, and you can't cheat with them. That's what Romans called Vis Comica, a gift, a strength, and a power. Lenny had this power and used it to point out and denounce the excesses of American society. He wasn't a clown, or a buffoon but he was a performer who built an ingenious talent to translate any sensitive subject  religion, politics, and society into an acerbic but hilarious social commentary. He epitomized the notion of making laugh and think. His approach was always provocative but never badly intentioned, in other words, he always had a point, something to denounce, but on one condition  it had to make people laugh &#x85; half-polemical, half-cynical, but always comical. A lot of close-ups on the audience are used in the film, a reminiscence of the same direction used in Cabaret  people look bored, upset, thoughtful, smiling, laughing, they're part of the artistic process, as long as they laugh at the end, and applaud, they get Lenny's point and appreciate his comedic talent. Indeed, you can't cheat with laughs.There's something profoundly cathartic in Lenny's humor, a desensitizing effect leading to a bigger tolerance. Lenny didn't even realize how beyond his time, how modern he was. He didn't know he would face a hateful crowd of opponents from an Establishment which could tolerate anything, except the use of profanity and obscenity on stage in a public place. And that's how Lenny became an unintentional barometer of freedom of speech in America. And as an irreverent character who believes in his ideas, he could never censor himself ... not because he wanted to defy the system, but because he was convinced he was defending a right cause. As long as people were genuinely laughing, he couldn't believe his words were considered obscene. His disbelief was sincere and turned his rebellious attitude into a form of political activism that kind of killed the fun, but never the relevance. Lenny's fate, in a tragic irony, is almost religious as he was sacrificed on the altar of intolerance, for his ideas and beliefs. The last shot of him naked, lying on the floor, is indecently shocking, so is the devastation in his voice when he's begging the judge to let him redo his sketch. I'll never forget the way Hoffman breaks his voice, shouting I didn't hurt anybody ... this heart-breaking sentence summarizes the whole martyrdom of Lenny Bruce. This film invites us to follow the tragic story of Lenny and understand this obscure part of America's history where the so-called moral society couldn't allow a performer to exercise his right to speak. It also invites us to question our own tolerance and then try to put our beliefs into perspective. Freedom of speech is like a gift from democracy, you can corrupt it by conveying fear, racism and hatred, or you can make people laugh by destroying all the barriers of political correctness and convince them that there's no segregation in words. Lenny's point is that we're all equally laughable, regardless of our cultures, our religions, our social status, life is too serious to be taken seriously. If the content of Lenny's sketches seems harmless now, that doesn't mean that freedom of speech should be taken for granted. If there are still some words that mustn't be said, or ideas that mustn't be expressed, this means the fight is not over yet.Lenny is built on a tertiary structure. One third of interviews of all the people who knew Lenny  his manager, his mother and his wife, Honey, played in an extraordinary underrated performance by Valerie Perrine. The chemistry between Honey and Lenny was poignant. Those are two persons, imperfect, but so endearing in their mutual love you could see that Lenny wasn't the bitterly cynical type of guy, he knew what love was about, and this love was one of his greatest inspirations. The heart of the film is Lenny's story, his ascension, the pinnacle of his career until the tragic descent into hell, on which he and Honey have a responsibility. Indeed, he and Honey were flawed, and the excesses that governed a big part of their life were not omitted. And this poignant tragicomedy is punctuated by sketches from a late-career Lenny, showing how he turned all these events that enriched his life into hilarious, provocative and insightful comments. It was not a way to make people laugh at him, but with him at all the flaws that make humans worth being mocked. Lenny's sketches relied on his capability of turning everything he touched into laughter, and that's the pure comedic talent.Lenny is about a man ahead of his time, a pioneer for entertainment and a martyr for freedom and dignity, but the deepest truth about Lenny, that makes his death sadder and more obscene lies in the heart of Honey, who, as a heart-breaking conclusion, simply says He was just so damn funny ","genre":null},{"date":"13 January 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Lenny tells the tragic fate of a pioneer and a martyr  the comedian Lenny Bruce whose irreverent courage paved the way to a whole new style of performance  stand-up comedy.

And, for the most part, these films marked a low-point in Disney history--as the great quality and artistry of their earlier full-length films (such as Snow White, Bambi and Pinocchio) and before the studio's rejuvenated late 40s and 1950s (with films such as Cinderella and Peter Pan). Much of this is probably due to the studio staff experiencing HUGE changes after WWII and a protracted union strike--and a very sizable number of animators and other artists were lost. Unlike the other features released just after the war, the shorts in Make Mine Music were very, very short.Blue Bayou--Thankfully this was a very short film, as I was contemplating suicide it was so boring and dreadful. The music was somewhat like Jeanette\/Nelson Eddy music and seemed very dated...and dull. 1 All Cats Come Join In--Benny Goodman and his orchestra provide the music and the style is a jazzy big-band sort of tune. The animation VERY simple--with characters with very non-detailed faces and backgrounds. While the music integrated well with the music and it was enjoyable, it would NEVER be confused with Fantasia as the look of this short was rather cheap. 3 A Ballade in Blue--A dull affair as a whiny guy sings about how life sucks without his beloved. Sure to make kids angry and restless. 1 Casey At The Bat--Probably the best and most famous of the shorts in this film. Jerry Colonna narrated the famous poem and it really came to life due to the silliness of the animation--which was reminiscent of a Goofy short. Too bad this short was so unlike the rest of the film and didn't seem to really fit the theme--which was really dull music and animation! There was only incidental music and this short forgot to be boring. 8 Two Silhouettes--Dinah Shore sings as silhouettes of a man and woman dance together. Frankly, if the earlier shorts didn't drive kids crazy with boredom, this one is sure to do it. Dull. 1 Peter and the Wolf--Oddly, this one began with a narration (Sterling Holloway--who later played Winnie the Pooh) as he explains how various instruments represent various characters in the story--then he continues to explain the story as the music plays. While I am not a huge fan of this short, it is head and shoulders better than most of them--and certainly is entertaining. Not a great film for most kids (unless they are a Frasier or Niles Crane sort of kid who adores classical or neo-classical music). But, it might also serve as a nice way to introduce kids to this sort of music. The animation of this one is noticeably better than the rest of the film and most adults should enjoy this film. 8 After You've Gone--The Goodman Quartet (including Benny Goodman) provide some bouncy music during which musical instruments, keyboards, fingers, etc. come to life. While kids will also surely hate this one, adults will probably find the music and animation zippy good fun. I didn't hate it. 6 Johnny Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet--Sung by the Andrews Sisters, this is the story about two hats that fall in love---something you DON'T see everyday! This is a pretty weird cartoon. Again, kids probably won't love this one but it was amazingly cute seeing these anthropomorphic hats. And the Andrews Sisters' music is pretty enjoyable and cute. 7 Opera Pathetique--This is sung by Nelson Eddy whose style of music is not to my liking although it was popular back in grand-pappy's day. The animation is much more enjoyable than most of the rest of the film but the singing is very operatic. If that's your thing, then are you in for a treat. However, if you think this sort of music is LESS enjoyable than hearing a cat being tortured, then it will be a chore to watch even with the cute animation of a gigantic singing whale. Cute but probably not everyone's cup 'o tea. 5 Overall, the film was hard to watch because it was so wildly uneven---it just frustrates the viewer to no end. Some of the shorts are very nice but many are just plain awful. Kids will most likely hate most of it and it's best you only show them a few selections. Adults will be, on the whole, more patient and willing to stick with it--particularly if they loved Fantasia--though the quality of Fantasia was almost always much higher--especially in regard to the artwork. For huge Disney-philes it's worth seeing--others might want to try renting this one instead of investing in the DVD.

For the first time since the early 1930s you could get away with making criminals the good guys. One of the nicest products of this new era of liberty was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, a Western very much of its time in style and values, and yet one so warmly human and respectful to genre convention you feel it was aching to be made all along.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is first of all a superbly written screenplay. What is striking is how witty it is from start to finish, enough to arguably classify it as a comedy Western. But this is far from being a Blazing Saddles-style spoof. The humour is very natural, and largely serves to make the characters instantly likable. A great example is the early scene in which Butch is challenged by Logan, and Butch uses his intelligence and his sense of humour to overcome his opponent, whereby from then on we admire and route for the guy. Another great aspect of the picture is how the two main characters are opposites who complement each other. The easygoing amiable Butch and the prickly, cynical Sundance are like a gentler version of the brains and brawn dynamic of many criminal duos both real and fictional.It may seem obvious now, but it was only after a lengthy selection process that Paul Newman and Robert Redford were cast as the eponymous heroes. But just like the written characters, this pair have a great rapport and complementary styles. Newman has such presence and charisma that, even though his character actually makes a lot of bad judgements throughout the picture, he still has the air of man people will look up to and follow. Redford handles the difficult balance of bringing out Sundance's curmudgeonly manner but giving us the impression that it's all a front and he is a nice guy deep down. Above all they both make their performances look effortless, so that although these are obviously heavily idealised portrayals of the real historical figures, we believe in them as genuine people.This was the picture in which ace director George Roy Hill really hit his stride. He often uses camera set-ups that may seem against cinematic convention but help to focus us purely on what is important. Take the sepia-toned sequence after the opening credits. We start with a very odd shot of Paul Newman walking through a town which, rather than show him in a more normal wide-shot showing off the whole street, frames him in mid-close-up. We then get a lengthy shot of Redford framed similarly whilst the gambler he is talking to has his back to us. What these shots do is draw us in completely on these two characters for their introduction scene, without distracting us with the faces of anyone who is inconsequential to the story. However, after these opening few shots we move to the wider group shots and landscapes that let us know we are in familiar Western territory. There are some other neat touches from Hill in the chase scenes that form the climax of the first half of the picture. He keeps the pursuing lawmen in long-shot, never allowing us to get a proper glimpse of them, which makes them a depersonalised presence, and puts us constantly in the place of heroes. Also rather than cutting back and forth as many chase sequences do, he has several set-ups in which both hunter and hunted are together in the same shot (very difficult to organise over such great distances), which gives a very realistic sense of the pursuit.The icing on the cake is surely the music. Not just the Burt Bacharach tunes, at turns achingly sad or wonderfully jaunty, but the way they are used. The central montage of sepia photos has a beautiful sense of nostalgia to it, and the fact that these good times are presented in a way that is somewhat distant and abstract gives them a tone of poignancy when compared to the bad times that are to come in Bolivia. These good old days are dead and gone, the montage seems to say. Of course Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head is a tad anachronistic but it suits the tone of the bike ride sequence perfectly. Touches like this, the occasional nods to the nouvelle vague and the modern-sounding score, along with the carefree ethos, make Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid very much a movie of its time. And yet, it does not have the pretentiousness or downright weirdness of so many late-60s cinema, and with its good-natured charm it is in fact one of the most accessible and enduring pieces of its era.

For the first time since the early 1930s you could get away with making criminals the good guys. One of the nicest products of this new era of liberty was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, a Western very much of its time in style and values, and yet one so warmly human and respectful to genre convention you feel it was aching to be made all along.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is first of all a superbly written screenplay. What is striking is how witty it is from start to finish, enough to arguably classify it as a comedy Western. But this is far from being a Blazing Saddles-style spoof. The humour is very natural, and largely serves to make the characters instantly likable. A great example is the early scene in which Butch is challenged by Logan, and Butch uses his intelligence and his sense of humour to overcome his opponent, whereby from then on we admire and route for the guy. Another great aspect of the picture is how the two main characters are opposites who complement each other. The easygoing amiable Butch and the prickly, cynical Sundance are like a gentler version of the brains and brawn dynamic of many criminal duos both real and fictional.It may seem obvious now, but it was only after a lengthy selection process that Paul Newman and Robert Redford were cast as the eponymous heroes. But just like the written characters, this pair have a great rapport and complementary styles. Newman has such presence and charisma that, even though his character actually makes a lot of bad judgements throughout the picture, he still has the air of man people will look up to and follow. Redford handles the difficult balance of bringing out Sundance's curmudgeonly manner but giving us the impression that it's all a front and he is a nice guy deep down. Above all they both make their performances look effortless, so that although these are obviously heavily idealised portrayals of the real historical figures, we believe in them as genuine people.This was the picture in which ace director George Roy Hill really hit his stride. He often uses camera set-ups that may seem against cinematic convention but help to focus us purely on what is important. Take the sepia-toned sequence after the opening credits. We start with a very odd shot of Paul Newman walking through a town which, rather than show him in a more normal wide-shot showing off the whole street, frames him in mid-close-up. We then get a lengthy shot of Redford framed similarly whilst the gambler he is talking to has his back to us. What these shots do is draw us in completely on these two characters for their introduction scene, without distracting us with the faces of anyone who is inconsequential to the story. However, after these opening few shots we move to the wider group shots and landscapes that let us know we are in familiar Western territory. There are some other neat touches from Hill in the chase scenes that form the climax of the first half of the picture. He keeps the pursuing lawmen in long-shot, never allowing us to get a proper glimpse of them, which makes them a depersonalised presence, and puts us constantly in the place of heroes.

What made that one particularly fun was that for just a little while, it looked like the mighty Arnold might actually lose.Three years later came the unjustly ignored Predator 2, minus Arnold, and that fact alone probably had a lot to do with its lack of box office clout at the time. Despite the lack of star power, Predator 2 stacks up nicely against its predecessor. Rather than simply rehash the first film with a new cast, this high-tech update takes the next logical step with the Predator concept by bringing the alien hunter into the urban jungle.Los Angeles 1997 is not a nice place to visit and you definitely wouldn't want to live there. Not only has an ongoing heat wave pegged the temperature around 110 degrees, but as the film opens we see that clashing gangs of Jamaican and Columbian drug peddlers are regularly waging open warfare in the city streets. Into this mix comes Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (a strong performance by Danny Glover), a tough-as-nails L.A. cop who stumbles into a Predator killing ground during a firefight between gangbangers and police. Harrigan and his team follow the string of grisly murders that follow, despite being warned to keep away by a creepy DEA agent played by the always-welcome Gary Busey. Harrigan and his squad believe at first that they're up against a human enemy, until once of his team members die at the hands (claws?) of the Predator and he finally sees the creature. From there it becomes personal for Harrigan and he wages a one-man war to bring the alien down, eventually leading to a thrilling mano-a-mano fight session aboard the Predator's spaceship, hidden deep below the city.In almost all respects, Predator 2 is a bigger, louder, and more colorful sequel. With a whole city to play in, Predator 2 offers a greater variety of scenery than the jungle setting of the original, which allows for more extensive stunt and action sequences. Glover does a commendable job stepping into Schwarzenegger's shoes, doing a 180 degree turn from the cautious, family-man cop he'd been portraying in the Lethal Weapon films around this time. The rest of Harrigan's team is filled out by Bill Paxton, who's his usual snarky self (as the newest member of the squad), Maria Conchita Alonso and Ruben Blades, both of whom occasionally seem a bit out of their element in an action film (my lone complaint). The appearances by legendary trash-TV host Morton Downey Jr. as a tabloid TV journalist are good for a few chuckles as well. (When I saw this in a theater in 1990, everyone cheered when Glover's character punched him out!) Australian director Stephen Hopkins keeps the explosions and gunfire coming throughout the film so Predator 2 certainly is never boring. It also expands some of the Predator mythology and gives you more of an idea of where they come from and why they're here than the first film did. Predator 2 remains a worthy sequel that deserves a second look, it's far better than you might have heard.

Angelina Jolie plays the young cop who finds the body and collects the forensic details. Washington's character is so impressed that he makes her secondment a condition of his assistance with the crime. At first she begrudges the idea; she had a nice safe desk-job lined up.But - it's a movie. She quickly gets a taste for the criminally exotic and a bit of a crush upon our hero.We join our dynamic duo as they pursue a series of clues in an attempt to anticipate each subsequent crime and save the victims from very gruesome deaths.This is a pretty formulaic thriller which carries a hint of de-ja-vu because there are so many in the genre. Helicopter flights around night-lit sky-scrapers? No CSI would be complete without them. The ambiance in particular reminds me of 'Silence Of The Lambs'; the murders are about as diabolical, there's a lot of Gothic imagery; even the theme and incidental music sounds like it might have been cloned from the earlier movie. The ending smacks of 'Rear Window'. That said; it's extremely intelligently filmed with some very nice set pieces. The leads give good turns with some excellent support from the likes of Queen Latifah and Luis Guzman. There's a solid sound-effects\/incidental music track with plenty of deep, visceral tones.I found the denouement a little confusing. Washington's character accuses the villain of deliberately planting evidence in criminal investigations. The villain insists that isn't so. It is not made clear exactly who is telling the truth, and there was scope for an interesting little twist here that was never taken up. There's a cheesy and not very believable epilogue.When you see how much money is to be made in media and fashion, a good-looking woman like Ms Jolie's character would hardly seek out the uncertainties of a police career when she might otherwise 'not get out of bed for less than £10,000'. Anybody know any gorgeous cops? Jolie's just too pretty to be true.This movie would score more highly but that there is so much competition in the crime-thriller genre. Definitely worth a watch - but then most of them are. They remind me of new cars; all very competent but so much alike.

It should have become a suspense classic but for some reason it has ended up being aired on anything but prime time on various TV-networks. I believe that this might be due to it not being one of Michael Douglas's most memorable films. His heart really didn't seem to be in it. Maybe he and Genevieve Bujold didn't hit it off or that it's more of her film than his. The other actors did swell, especially Widmark, Torn and Ashley.Bujold gives an energetic performance and is utterly believable as the paranoid yet justifiably suspicious doctor seeking the answer to the question There have been 12 cases of unexplained coma in young healthy patients the last year; don't you find that surprising? And everybody replies No. And there's of course the priceless Jefferson Institute. The sequence where the protagonists approach its sinister exterior is very well done in a Hitchcockian fashion. Its inside and creepy activities are fundamental, not merely to the story, but to the overall impact of this picture.
