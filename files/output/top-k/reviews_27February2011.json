It shows how cooking can be a fantastic thing when having a mixture of love and passion. The film gives the viewer, especially Northern Americans, a magical insight of how Mexican culture is about love, celebrating and the joys of cooking. Tita cooks up different recipes, and while doing so pours all of her love and passion into them to the point where anyone who feasts on them starts feeling the love and passion as well. Like Water for chocolate was directed by Alfonso Aru and written by Laura Equsivel. It won 11 Ariel awards of the Mexican Academy of Motion Pictures and became the highest grossing Spanish-Language film to ever be released in the United States. This is important because this film has made history in not only Mexico but in the United States as well. It also means this film is one of the few Spanish films to do well in the United States. The characters in the film go through a journey of anger, love and the magic of cooking. When Tita cooks a certain recipe it relates her love for Pedro. Once people start to eat her cooking they feel whatever Tita was feeling. One specific scene is when Tita has cooked a recipe of quail and mixed in sauce from roses. When everyone is eating the meal, their expressions are filled with love and passion. Lines such as, Not only Tita's blood but her whole being had dissolved into the rose sauce shows how meaningful and magical Tita's cooking is. Not just for her, but for the other characters as well. The performances from Lumi Cavazos (Tita) and Regina Torne (Mama Elena) in this film is not beyond splendid but nor is it coming up short. A specific scene that both women performed amazingly well is when Mama Elena's ghost arrives behind Tita. The way Lumi and Regina were going back and forth with one another delivering their lines was filled with drama. When Tita said I hate you, I always hated you, it was a way of Tita letting Mama Elena know she is not afraid of her anymore. When Mama Elena said, See what you've caused? That line also puts the viewer over the edge because the way she delivers the line let's the viewer know she means business. The lighting in this film was dark orange. It is symbolic of the burning passion the characters experienced in this film. Dr. John gives one of his grandmother's quotes saying, We're all born with a box of matches inside. We can't light them by ourselves. We need oxygen and a help of a candle. Each character needed love and passion to light the matches so they would be able to feel liberated. The costumes also signal the characters different emotions. Whenever the woman attended funerals they wore black dresses to represent their mood. The rich characters would wear fancy looking clothing. The poor wore cheap looking clothing While, there were some good highlights the film did have its faults. The film didn't have 100% Mexican actors. The actress Claudette Maill√© looked as if she was Irish. The thing is that Gertrudis character was mix with African American and Mexican, so it would have helped the authenticity of the film to have found an actress that looked like that kind of person. I felt the film was very good with the way Esquivel used magical realism to get the message of love and passions across. The fact that Esquivel showed cooking comes from the heart and can bring love to one another is a valuable message. I would recommend the film to anyone who wants to know the real meaning of passion and enjoys the wonders of cooking. If viewers watch in a metaphorical way, and not literal, they can see the magical realism in the film, which makes it more enjoyable.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"27 February 2011","score":"","review":" In most Mexican films one sees a dramatic story of lovers who battle all odds only to wind up dying. Like Water for Chocolate wasn't much different. We have two people, Tita and Pedro, who are forced to tiptoe around their relationship and keep it under wraps. Pedro marries Tita's sister, Rosaura, in order to be closer to Tita. Under the watchful eye of Mama Elena, the two are caught in a net of what is acceptable to society and what they feel to be right. Tita grew up in the kitchen and the way the book is set up is through recipes and their relation to life. Throughout the story her emotions are poured into her dishes, and those who consume the food are overwhelmed with her sentiments. Her sadness over Pedro's wedding to Rosaura causes the wedding cake she made to make everyone ill with heartache. Her quail with rose petal sauce evokes those who devour it to feel a great passion and sexual experience. The way that food affects people in different ways is a key point in this film. If the viewer does not have a metaphorical mindset when watching Like Water for Chocolate, then they will not understand the significances of every little thing. One must pay attention to color changes in the roses from pink and white, to red, as they were soaked with Tita's blood. Without that realization it's hard to grasp how Tita's love was soaked into roses in the quail dish. Like Water for Chocolate doesn't only focus on the way food plays a part in Mexican culture, but also has a focus on tradition vs. modernity in turn-of-the-century times. Tita was supposed to never marry and care for Mama Elena until Mama Elena died. Tita made sure that tradition died with her. Tita's sister, Gertrudis, defied traditional ways by leaving home, working in a brothel for a year, and then joining the military. The eldest sister, Rosaura, tried to stay traditional and tradition ruined her. From a personal standpoint I feel the movie followed the book more than most do. A few adjustments were made here and there. A significant one being the ending was rushed in the film as opposed to the book. The story itself was enjoyable and should appeal to everyone's tastes in some way. On the other hand it is a difficult book to read, let alone movie to follow. One really must be able to see things as symbols for something else. If the viewer tries to relax and watch the film without having their own train of thought during, then most likely they will not enjoy it. Acting in the movie isn't bad, but the portrayal of some characters was surprising. Mama Elena is presented as an American. Gertrudis stands out with her fiery red hair, and John is even plainer than the book depicted. Mama Elena isn't as fierce in the film as she was in the book. In the book she was this terrifying dictator over the family, but in the movie she just yelled at lot, and gave mean glares. When capturing the beauty of the Mexican countryside and how the war affected life on the ranch, the director was spot-on. Even though the scene was brief, when Mama Elena defended her home against the soldiers, it had a huge impact on the film. I highly recommend seeing this movie and reading the book. Definitely watch the film in Spanish with English subtitles. If one tried to watch a dubbed version then it will take away from the movie. The sound is atrocious and distracting. Also be aware of the movie's R rating and scene's of nudity.

The movie shows a different perspective of Mexican life by using a girl as the main character.The girl is filled with emotions, and the audience gets to see the struggles of a Mexican tradition. The film focuses on the love between Pedro and Tita and the choices she must face. Tita was brought into the world with onions. This is the first metaphor used, showing that onions make a person cry; therefore, she would face sadness. Instead of presenting the emotions normally, food is portraying the emotions. The film has many recipes that are filled with sensations that transport the actors, as well as the audience through a different reality. I easily could relate with the emotions that the main character, Tita was going through. The director decides to show the metaphors and emotions so well, that it was hard not to share the same sensations that the characters were feeling. The scene where Tita makes the quail with rose petal sauce depicts how much love is put into her food. Everything that she cooks is shown in a different light in the film. The rose petals change colors, allowing us to see the pink, then the passionate red roses. The camera presents each scene in a special way, zooming in and focusing on one thing; therefore, letting the audience feel and relate. I really enjoyed this movie because it presents such passion. Tita fought for what she wanted. Throughout the movie you always question, what will happen next? That is the point of the movie. You should not always follow rules. It is okay to take chances, and break out of the normal traditions. Everything that is shown in the film has different meanings. The great thing about this film is that everyone can have different meanings of the metaphors and theme. At the end, when matches are eaten one can think of several meanings. Tita's motivation was fulfilled, her passion would forever be lighting up. There are many different mystical dimensions, like Gertrudis in the shower. The shower is not really on fire, but the passion is metaphorically being demonstrated. The title of the film even has a powerful impact. You can choose which path to take in life, like choosing water with chocolate or milk with chocolate, but it is obvious that you can tell water is more digestible than milk. It is like Tita choosing how to live life, and which option to choose. Should she choose the better man, which would be an easier path in life, or the lover with a difficult path? You always have to have a twist to a movie, and the ending is very shocking. I was very surprised, but once you put everything together it makes perfect sense. I really enjoyed this film because it showed something never ever seen in Mexican film before, and the uses of magical realism and metaphors were phenomenal.

This film, on the other hand kept the word boring running through my mind. Ghost Dog is not a thriller because the bad guys are so inept and unrealistic that any sense of danger disappears, nor is it a drama because the characters are mostly stereotypes and show no development, nor is it action because of its focus characters sleeping, driving, watching TV etc etc. If I had to make up a genre for the film it would be hip hop comedy spy movie that isn't that funny with cultural references. Even from a technical standpoint, the director doesn't do any interesting as far as camera shots and cinematography goes.

Jump forward to the year 2036 & Todd (Kurt Russell) is a veteran soldier but the ruthless Colonel Mekum (Jason Isaacs) has genetically engineered & trained an even better, stronger, faster & lethal breed of soldier. To demonstrate his soldiers strength Todd is told to fight Mekum's top soldier Caine 607 (Jason Scott Lee) who wins the duel & leaves Todd for dead. Dumped on the rubbish tip planet Arcadia 234 Todd discovers a small community of people whose spaceship crashed there several years before, they take Todd in & nurse him back to health but his violent ways lead them to expel him from the community. Meanwhile during a security sweep of the planet Colonel Mekum's soldiers start killing the community & Todd fights back on his own against the almost unstoppable soldiers that replaced him...This English American co-production was directed by Paul W.S. Anderson this huge box-office failure has a pretty bad reputation in some quarters but it's nice to come on the IMDb & see a more than respectable 5.6 average User Rating out of ten over almost seventeen thousand votes & I have to say that I am a big fan of Soldier. I enjoyed it back in 1999 when it was released straight to video\/DVD here in the UK & enjoyed it just as much when I watched it again last night for the first time in several years. The script was written by David Webb Peoples who wrote the classic sci-fi film Blade Runner (1982), the underwater monster flick Leviathan (1989), Clint Eastwood's multi Oscar winning western (Soldier could be seen as a sort of sci-fi\/western actually) Unforgiven (1992) & the sci-fi film Twelve Monkeys (1995) so he's capable of writing deep drama as well as striking sci-fi which is at odds with Soldier as it's more of a straight forward action film set in the future. I think Soldier is vastly underrated, it moves along at a great pace, there is loads of explosions, fights & cool military weapons & vehicle's, a really good performance by star Kurt Russell & has just about enough humanity for you care about what's happening & those it's happening to. Despite barely saying a word it's amazing how much personality & emotion comes through from Todd, the other character's are a little one dimensional especially the main villain Colonel Mekum & the colonists who are all peace loving vegetable growing types. At a little over 90 minutes Soldier doesn't outstay it's welcome & I wasn't bored or felt the film dragged once, the central message of needing to be taught humanity & the importance of having it is reasonably well put across but a bit awkward at times (Kurt Russell pumped up soldier trying his hand at some organic gardening while Celtic chants plays on the soundtrack) but as I said Soldier works better as straight forward sci-fi action film & if that's what your looking for I doubt you will be disappointed with this.I must admit that I loved the visual style of Soldier, the special effects are great & seem to be a clever mixture of model shots, CGI computer effects &, gasp, real life elements. For instance the shot as Todd first looks out on & surveys the dusty landscape of Arcadia 234 & there's the yellow sky, the sand blowing everywhere & a huge military war ship sticking out of the sand on it's side is very striking & very convincing. The sets, weapons, vehicles, spaceships & costumes are great & Soldier looks top notch. There's a nice amount of violence here, there are some great fights including one up a set of chains, plenty of huge explosions, shoot-outs & a couple of gory moments as throats are slit & huge knives are shoved into peoples eyes. A sort of futuristic Rambo meets Universal Soldier (1992) the themes of some super soldier learning the meaning of humanity & finally taking on those he once served has been done before but Soldier is one of the best & most enjoyable examples & is miles better than the terrible Solo (1996) which has almost exactly the same story but without the futuristic setting.With a supposed budget of about $75,000,000 this looks & sounds great, I love the mixing of traditional model & modern CGI effects work & think that the visual look & style of the film draws you in. The production values are top notch. The acting is alright although I thought Kurt Russell was great, he speaks only 104 words but you do end up feeling for him as he puts in a subtle yet extremely effective performance. Jason Scott Lee makes for an imposing nemesis while Jason Isaacs is suitably slimy as the ruthless Colonel.Soldier is a firm favourite of mine, sure it flopped big time but I don't care as I think it's a great sci-fi action western hybrid that delivers even if some of the subtext & themes are a little awkwardly handled. If your looking for a sci-fi action film with great special effects, lots of explosions & a little bit of heart then I throughly recommend Soldier as an underrated gem.

","genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"27 February 2011","score":"","review":" I simply could not wait to see the film Like Water for Chocolate, after I finished Laura Esquivel's book. The brilliant author and now screenwriter, Laura Esquivel, is a native of the culturally rich Mexico. In her novel, Like Water for Chocolate, Esquivel used flowing magical realism to explore the importance of love, family, and art in Mexico. As a woman, myself, I found the novel to be very empowering and that's probably why it was a best seller in Esquivel's home land in 1989! I believe that she adapted and upheld the same metaphorical experiences of her novel to the film adequately well! Like Water for Chocolate was directed by Alfonso Arau and released in 1992. It was indeed a pel√≠cula rom√°ntica y dram√°tica! Just like the novel, it was set on the ranch de la Garza family, near Piedras Negras, Mexico. I love that the narrator was a voice over and that she told the audience the family recipes that intertwined the story. The recipes gave the film a visual appeal with the colorful appearance of la comida. Yet, the real appeal was in the emotion it took to prepare the visual feast.Most of the film had darkened lighting, as if it were a representation of the undertone of the story. The film, as well as the novel, told the fate of the two lovers Tita, played by Lumi Cavazos, and Pedro, played by Marco Leonardi. Their satire of a romance was full of twists and character evolution. Tita gave the most inspirational performance with her passionate words and magical cooking. I will admit that she was not how imagined her when I read the book, but her character grew greatly on me. I was up and down with her throughout her experiences. I feel that Esquivel took the most important parts of Tita's life from her book to include in the cinema. Pedro's acting was just alright, yet his seldom words spoke of true love and passion. I swear you'll have my love forever, Pedro plead with Tita. There were many times when the future of Tita's happiness looked dim and I wanted her to run away to find a better future for herself! I was glad that Esquivel included Tita's crucial line and question of honesty to herself, I did once, and it was all lies. I won't listen to you anymore. That is the whole purpose of Esquivel's tale, though! When one finds true love, one knows and can't deny it. Perhaps the more crucial line was that made by Doctor John (Arau 1992)each of us is born with a box of matches inside us...light the matches one at a time. If a powerful emotion should ignite them all at once they would produce a splendor so dazzling that it would illuminate far beyond what we can normally see&#x85;a brilliant tunnel would appear&#x85;summoning us to regain the divine origin we had lost. Doctor John Brown played a very small part in the film. However, with his role he introduced the symbolism of matches to the screen. It was beautiful to see on film the emotions the characters consistently expressed. The matches are an interesting element that represents the spark of the flame that yearns to be lit within Tita. Ladies, this is a great movie to see if one believes in true love and the love of a lifetime; of all that it is worth. Might I also add that the matches serve as a perfect reminder of the fire that creates boiling water, hence water for chocolate. Pedro's short aggressive remarks, like, This is nectar of the gods, blazed an intense fire that constantly heated Tita's pool of emotions. She was constantly on the verge of boiling over! It was satisfying to my imagination to see Pedro's love for Tita ignited on screen. Almost as ingredients to a full course meal, the supporting characters added flavor to the table. The protagonists were the simple, yet uniquely heated, characters of Nacha, played by Ada Carrasco, Chencha, who was played Pilar Aranda, and the ever-so-lovely Gertrudis, played by Claudette Maill√©. I must say, Gertrudis' love scene in the movie made me blush. It was oddly exhilarating and it showed that even she had a flame that needed to be freed by matches! Aye, aye! The people who dampened Tita's matches were the antagonists of the film. Mama Elena looked lady-like on the surface, but Regina Torn√©'s character was the repressed, controlling shadow of the story. Rosaura, who was played by Yareli Arizmendi, was the other antagonist with her chubby and flatulent self. Yet, no character shone brighter than the flame and whole self of Tita. I would highly recommend this movie to all of the hopeless romantics, hard-working women, and passionate people out there! I believe in the message that this movie implies everyone has a match inside them that's wanting and waiting to be lit! The film Like Water for Chocolate ignites and intrigues it's audience with food, new beginnings, freedom, and of course, passion! Therefore, I say, eat my child; food will make it hurt less.

It was beautiful to see on film the emotions the characters consistently expressed. The matches are an interesting element that represents the spark of the flame that yearns to be lit within Tita. Ladies, this is a great movie to see if one believes in true love and the love of a lifetime; of all that it is worth. Might I also add that the matches serve as a perfect reminder of the fire that creates boiling water, hence water for chocolate. Pedro's short aggressive remarks, like, This is nectar of the gods, blazed an intense fire that constantly heated Tita's pool of emotions. She was constantly on the verge of boiling over! It was satisfying to my imagination to see Pedro's love for Tita ignited on screen. Almost as ingredients to a full course meal, the supporting characters added flavor to the table. The protagonists were the simple, yet uniquely heated, characters of Nacha, played by Ada Carrasco, Chencha, who was played Pilar Aranda, and the ever-so-lovely Gertrudis, played by Claudette Maill√©. I must say, Gertrudis' love scene in the movie made me blush. It was oddly exhilarating and it showed that even she had a flame that needed to be freed by matches! Aye, aye! The people who dampened Tita's matches were the antagonists of the film. Mama Elena looked lady-like on the surface, but Regina Torn√©'s character was the repressed, controlling shadow of the story. Rosaura, who was played by Yareli Arizmendi, was the other antagonist with her chubby and flatulent self. Yet, no character shone brighter than the flame and whole self of Tita. I would highly recommend this movie to all of the hopeless romantics, hard-working women, and passionate people out there! I believe in the message that this movie implies everyone has a match inside them that's wanting and waiting to be lit! The film Like Water for Chocolate ignites and intrigues it's audience with food, new beginnings, freedom, and of course, passion! Therefore, I say, eat my child; food will make it hurt less. The dish has already been served by Alfonso Arau and Laura Esquivel. Better to watch it, before it gets cold!By Ashley Duvelius ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"27 February 2011","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" If you like thrillers set inside the legal systems, the stories by Grisham is one of the best.

Of course, the book is much more complex, much more intense, so if you like the movie I can really recommend reading the book.The Chamber is about the young lawyer, Adam Hall, that returns to his family's roots in Mississippi, where one of the family's dark secrets is hidden.

But Sam is not really cooperative, and even though the bombing was in the sixties, secrets are very much still in play, powerful and dangerous.I think the movie do capture enough of the book to be an intense and suspenseful movie, very much thanks to Gene Hackman's acting.

As I was watching it, with most movies I start with a 7 (by default) and adjust upward or downward based upon if there's something I actively like or dislike about it. As I was watching this, I started with a '10' due to impact, atmosphere (I loved the NY ooze of Christopher Walken and Lindsay Crouse and the 1989 vibe as 1989 was a magical year for me - I just never realized it back then), message, blending of genres, and potential for being memorable to me (kinda like impact, lol). And I immediately deducted 1 point each for a) a slightly meandering plot\/very occasional dragging and b) I personally thought the short grays looked stupid\/comic and the floating aliens too undetailed compared to some of the other movies. And thus thought I rated the movie an '8'. Quite respectable. After sleeping on it, I decided to read what others said about Communion on IMDb (reviews and message board threads), and was surprised to realize I actually rated it a '9'. I decided b) above was a bogus deduction as who the hell am I to think the aliens looked silly if this was a movie really based upon a reputable guy who did NOT just cook these things up for intriguing movie effect?

It tells the story of a Mexican family and the life they lead. It is full of everything your typical movie has, love, lust and lies. It reminds me in a way of a Mexican fairytale. Girl is in love with boy but can't have him, and has an evil mother always getting in the way of things and bossing her around. It focuses on family, tradition and a love like no other.It incorporates food into the entire movie and really shows you just how important it is to what is going on. I love that the food becomes magical and can change emotions of the characters. It's magical how it all happens. It's interesting because some cultures really do believe in this. During this point when the movie is supposed to take place, the whole Mexican Revolution is going on. They portray this very well in a scene where they come to fight off Tita's family. It is a small scene but makes a big impact. The scenery used in the movie is absolutely beautiful and looks to authentic. There are many scenes where they show the countryside, it looks so beautiful.The actors aren't bad, but however they could have done a better job at casting Mama Elena and John. John's character seems kind of a weaker and very plain character. Mama Elena doesn't even really look Mexican. Compared to the book the characters don't seem as well developed, but of course you will get that with most movies turned into a book. It has some good lines in it and seemed to follow directly along with the book. When watching the movie it is in Spanish with English subtitles. It is a little difficult to follow but overall just like any other movie with subtitles. I recommend not watching the dubbed version, it sounds horrible and you will not be able to concentrate on the movie. Compared to how typically Mexican movies normally end this one has a very different and unique ending, but a good one at that.The movie is a lot like another movie I have seen, Simply Irresistible starring Sarah Michelle Geller, involving the whole idea of magical food. It has to do with a young chef when whatever emotions she feels when cooking it is then brought out again when she serves it to her customers at her restaurant. Both movies really do a good job at having food being such an important and magical aspect. Overall it is a movie worth watching and if you like it you should definitely read the book. I think the book is a lot better, it's a page turner. I would also like to note that this movie is rated R. It is not intended for children. There are a few scenes that include full nudity. Also, if you don't have an active imagination or a love for food, this movie may not be for you.

But I feel that merely copying the outward appearance of the world would not result in anything real -- that is only copying. I think that to find what is real one must look very closely at one's world, to search for those things that contribute to this reality which one feels under the surface. The novels of Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Turgenev show us what these things are. To be an artist means to search for, find, and look at these things; to be an artist means never to avert one's eyes. (Akira Kurosawa)Writing about Kurosawa has always been a challenge for me. He's one of the greatest cinematic Gods, and is the guru of Japanese film for many of us. How can one describe his 'magnum opus', the greatest of all and the first actual samurai-picture. Seven Samurai is a grand, epic fresco about life and death, victory and defeat, glory and the loss of it; one can see that Kurosawa was infatuated by the very same themes, the greatest playwright of all, William Shakespeare was. Dealing with his own culture's taboos characterized Kurosawa's entire work but he drilled down deeper, neglecting historical or cultural limitations. He drilled down to pure emotion, to humanity and the depth of it.In the early 1950's Japanese films came to Europe for the first time, and its masters were instantly renowned for their unique style. French critic and film theorist, Andre Bazin wrote that the appreciation towards these films might just be first-time flush and fascination for exotic culture. But after he had seen about twenty Japanese films, he was sure it wasn't just that. There was something more. In 1954, when Akira Kurosawa had just finished his most ambitious film, European audiences and critics were thrilled once again. This was something completely new and, different from everything they had admired about Japanese cinema, for which we can give the credit to Mizoguchi's lyricism. Akira Kurosawa made a Japanese western; the very first samurai-film. It had the same elements American westerns did, and Seven Samurai can easily be compared with the finest films by John Ford.'Samurai' comes from the word; 'to serve', and samurais were servants. They were a class of their own in feudal Japan, and not until the end of the 17th century was the class removed. Even that samurais were servants they were part of the upper-class; they were used, not only to serve but, also to smash small peasant revolts. Samurais even had the right to kill a man who acted disrespectfully towards a representative of the samurai-class. Sometimes, due to boredom and poverty, samurais had to take smaller jobs without gaining much money, and this is exactly what happens in Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. But still the samurais do their job out of solidarity, with heart and talent.A group of bandits terrorize a small farmers' village due to which the village hires seven samurais to protect them. Through hard work and precise strategies the samurais, together with the peasants, overthrow the forty bandits and villagers can grow rice in peace once again. The storyline resembles various westerns, for instance John Ford's Stagecoach (1939), but there is something more in Seven Samurai. The beauty of the simple plot has something that great novels by Dostoevsky have. This Japanese fresco is wider, more complex and manifold. To this simple story Kurosawa has added depth and beauty through brilliant details which usually are the things that make the films by him so great. In the midst of the grand fighting sequences Kurosawa has placed scenes which offer several humanely interesting and understanding characteristics of life and human nature. He offers lyric flashes of the beauty of nature and love; a flowing river, crying men, a woman throwing herself into a burning house because she has lost her glory, and the sparking love between one samurai and a farmer's girl. These kind of emotional scenes, Kurosawa often seals with rain. The cleansing, but also melancholy, rain.After the violent final sequence, where the samurais and the farmers have to kill the last 13 bandits, the film returns to its calm rhythm. Four of the samurais have died, and the last three look at the farmers planting rice. The samurais didn't win the war, they lost; they got their rice and were unemployed once again. Life won the war, and the fearful peace-loving farmers got the reward; not the warlike but helpful samurais.There is so much to say about this timeless masterpiece which is impossible to process in one thousand words. Seven Samurai is a beautiful film about humanity and the depth of it. It's a complex and life-enhancing fresco. A gorgeous tale of the human nature and solidarity. Just as John Ford, so did Kurosawa portray brave men but to him bravery wasn't all glory and fame; in Seven Samurai we see men crying, talking about emotions and what's on their minds. This was an unconventional theme for Japan and it proves how much more humane Seven Samurai is compared to western masterpieces. This should not be interpreted as an insult towards westerns or John Ford, not at all, he was one of Kurosawa's biggest influences -- and bravery was never a shallow or simple theme for Ford either. Kurosawa's social and political ideologies are not hard to see but overall the lyricism and beauty of the ending indicate that humanism is the greatest ideal of all for him. I feel that it is only fair to end this review the way it started, by quoting the master himself.An action film can only be an action film. But how wonderful it is if it can also depict the human nature. It has been my dream ever since I was a co-director.

But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please help Arnie fix that beat up old Plymouth Fury while I write the next paragraph).It is 1978 where Arnie Cunningham is a bit of a dork, he wears glasses and can't get a girl to save his life. His best friend, Dennis Guilder, tries to help him out, but he's just not cut out for that kind of thing yet. After a run-in with some bullies at school one day, Dennis is giving Arnie a lift home when Arnie spots a car for sale. It's a beaten up red 1958 Plymouth Fury nicknamed 'Christine' by the owner whose brother, the former owner, had recently died. Arnie is instantly in love with the car and pays the asking price there and then. His parents don't want the car at home and so he keeps it at Darnell's 'Do It Yourself Garage' nearby. There is something strange about the car that Arnie can't quite put his finger on, but he works hard to bring her back to her former glory. As time goes by he begins to become more and more confident in himself as his obsession with the car grows. By now he has a girlfriend, Leigh Cabot, but woe betide anyone that gets between Arnie and Christine. Now, you remember those bullies I mentioned earlier, well&#x85; Looks like that's all you're gonna get from me, you didn't expect the entire thing did you? Sorry to disappoint.Based on a novel by Stephen King I found this to be a pretty good adaptation of the story. The characters are well rounded and, of course, it's a damn good tale. John Carpenter did an excellent job with the special effects, no CGI back then, but you wouldn't know. Pretty good performances all round, particularly from Keith Gordon as Arnie Cunningham, he really had to ring the changes in this one. John Stockwell did a pretty good job as Dennis Guilder, as did Alexandra Paul as Leigh Cabot. I also have to mention Robert Prosky whose almost comic-book performance as Will Darnell was excellent and it was nice to see a younger Harry Dean Stanton as Detective Rudolph Junkins.At the end of the day the star of the show is definitely the car, Christine. It has its own personality and a big role to play in the film. This is brought across very well by some excellent direction, some brilliant special effects and the performances of the human cast. It's far from perfect I know, maybe a little long, but at the end of the day it's still worth a watch (or two&#x85; preferably sober, but not essential)&#x85; Recommended.My score 6.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 February 2011","score":"","review":" This is one of those movies that I've seen bits and pieces of over the years, but never all the way through, until now.

But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please help Arnie fix that beat up old Plymouth Fury while I write the next paragraph).It is 1978 where Arnie Cunningham is a bit of a dork, he wears glasses and can't get a girl to save his life. His best friend, Dennis Guilder, tries to help him out, but he's just not cut out for that kind of thing yet. After a run-in with some bullies at school one day, Dennis is giving Arnie a lift home when Arnie spots a car for sale. It's a beaten up red 1958 Plymouth Fury nicknamed 'Christine' by the owner whose brother, the former owner, had recently died. Arnie is instantly in love with the car and pays the asking price there and then. His parents don't want the car at home and so he keeps it at Darnell's 'Do It Yourself Garage' nearby. There is something strange about the car that Arnie can't quite put his finger on, but he works hard to bring her back to her former glory. As time goes by he begins to become more and more confident in himself as his obsession with the car grows. By now he has a girlfriend, Leigh Cabot, but woe betide anyone that gets between Arnie and Christine. Now, you remember those bullies I mentioned earlier, well&#x85; Looks like that's all you're gonna get from me, you didn't expect the entire thing did you? Sorry to disappoint.Based on a novel by Stephen King I found this to be a pretty good adaptation of the story. The characters are well rounded and, of course, it's a damn good tale. John Carpenter did an excellent job with the special effects, no CGI back then, but you wouldn't know. Pretty good performances all round, particularly from Keith Gordon as Arnie Cunningham, he really had to ring the changes in this one. John Stockwell did a pretty good job as Dennis Guilder, as did Alexandra Paul as Leigh Cabot. I also have to mention Robert Prosky whose almost comic-book performance as Will Darnell was excellent and it was nice to see a younger Harry Dean Stanton as Detective Rudolph Junkins.At the end of the day the star of the show is definitely the car, Christine. It has its own personality and a big role to play in the film. This is brought across very well by some excellent direction, some brilliant special effects and the performances of the human cast. It's far from perfect I know, maybe a little long, but at the end of the day it's still worth a watch (or two&#x85; preferably sober, but not essential)&#x85; Recommended.My score 6.5\/10 ","genre":"Action, Drama, Horror"},{"date":"27 February 2011","score":"","review":" Mexican culture is deeply rooted in the plot and atmosphere of Like Water for Chocolate. Tita is represented as a typical Mexican girl forced to stay single and take care of her mother until she dies; Mama Elena represents a harsh dictator entrenched in tradition. Viewers watch as Tita determines whether to relinquish to Mama Elena's control or to rebel and run away with her lover Pedro.Mama Elena is portrayed by Regina Torn√© who has a sharply defined jawline and face which accentuates her power and strict nature. You know that as my youngest daughter you must look after me until the day I die. This and other statements were made to Tita in reference to the harsh Mexican culture. Mama Elena's reappearance as a ghost emphasizes her domineering spirit and her ever-near presence. Tita, even after Mama Elena is dead, is still shown almost questioning whether or not she should go ahead with her decision because Mama would be displeased. This shows the impact that this tradition had on Mexican families and their culture. Her costume is almost Victorian which gives the audience a visual metaphor for how the Victorian women were powerful and overbearing. Regina Torne's acting skills were mediocre when compared to typical American films, but when compared to Mexican films from this decade, she did excellent.Tita is an excellent cook and a good daughter in today's terms, but Mama Elena would disagree. Tita, in Mama Elena's mind, was a daughter who needed to understand the importance of family and tradition. Tita just wanted to marry Pedro and live happily ever after, but Mama Elena firmly declared, Tell him if it's to ask for your hand, he needn't bother. I don't want to waste their time. Mama Elena's character laid the foundation for the other characters; they all revolved around Mama Elena's rules and guidelines. The entire plot does too, actually. Another way Mama Elena is given more emphasis is the way the camera uses the choker affect to accentuate power and the spotlight is directed on her much more than the other characters.Mama Elena is a metaphor for the harsh dictatorship in Mexico at the time of the Mexican Revolution. She symbolizes everything that the government was trying to enforce on the Mexican people, but she could also simply represent an overbearing mother or mother-in-law for that matter. Those with a desire to learn more about Mexican culture at the time of the Mexican Revolution should certainly see this movie. I would recommend reading the novel first, and as you watch the movie try to identify some of the metaphors used throughout it.

It was supposed to usher in a whole new era of Bond adventures and Pierce Brosnan was much lauded as the best Bond of all time. But the years have not been kind to this film. After the admittedly impressive stunt-scene opening on the gigantic dam, it lapses into crudity and chaos, with an embarrassingly bad car chase thrown in for no reason, a cringeworthy script and a distinct lack of scene-setting for both our hero and his motivations. I admit it, I've been spoiled by Daniel Craig's outing CASINO ROYALE, which is at least three times as good as this effort.The good news is that the film improves somewhere after the outset, although it still feels disjointed and the plot doesn't make a great deal of sense. I appreciated the Russian villains, but the double-crossing plot is a bit lacklustre and Bond just seems to be in the right place at the right time all the while. I suppose you could say that believability is lacking. In the end, all the things that were wrong with Hollywood in the 1990s &#x96; lame humour, an emphasis on computer effects and spectacle over intricacy and tension, bloated running times and seen-it-all-before fatigue &#x96; are present here.Still, there are a few halfway decent action sequences to enjoy along the way. The big tank chase that occurs halfway through is the film's highlight, a masterpiece of technical skill, even if the tone varies wildly with unwelcome comedy popping up all the while. The movie also boasts a great villain in Sean Bean, sadly beginning his typecasting as a Hollywood bad guy that continues to this day. He's certainly better than the smarmy Brosnan, whose Bond is and will always be my least favourite of the various actors who've played the iconic spy over the years.I didn't really like Famke Janssen's wildly over-the-top femme fatale here. She's featured in an explicit sex scene that has no place in a Bond film and her mannerisms are completely over the top, cartoonish even. Still, there are some welcome faces in minor roles here, from larger-than-life Robbie Coltrane as a sinister contact and Tceky Karyo as a politician to Michael Kitchen as a nervous spy chief and Joe Don Baker as an ally. Desmond Llewelyn gets some genuine laughs in his appearance as Q and Judi Dench is excellent here as the ball-busting M. The less said about Alan Cumming, embarrassingly bad in one of those geeky hacker type roles, the better.

The film is created with one part passion, a scoop of tradition, a pinch of love and a lot of food.I would highly recommend reading the novel before viewing the film as at times I could see how it could be a little bit confusing. Upon the film's release, it was the highest grossing Spanish language film to be released in the United States. The film is very different from the typical Mexican film, which is funny as one of the themes for the film is tradition.The film celebrates Mexican culture though food, music and history. This was perhaps the most real thing about the film. The acting is hard to grasp. It is border line cheesy and was at times difficult to focus on. The film is so full of passionate lust and star struck lovers that it appears to be a bit clich√© now a days. This is how the novel was written, however. Esquivel explored the heat between two forbidden lovers, almost like a Spanish Romeo and Juliet. The story follows Tita and the man she loves, Pedro, as she expresses her emotions through her cooking, literally, for she has no other means of expression.The novel is full of magical realism through Tita's cooking and although the film was true to the novel, the convincing elements of magical realism as written by Esquivel were much harder to swallow when being viewed in the film. The film, like the novel, is rich with symbolism. The most obvious and interesting would be the title, Like Water for Chocolate, which refers to the boiling temperature water must reach in order to liquefy chocolate. The title is perfect for the burning passion experienced by Tita and the sexual desires felt by not only her and Pedro, but others in the family as well. Gertrudis, Tita's middle sister, experiences sexual desire after consuming a meal Tita had made, quail with rose petal sauce. This is just one effect of Tita's impassioned food.If you have not read the novel, the film will likely not appeal to you. The acting is not exactly top notch, and the beautiful images expressed though the novel are not nearly translated as well on screen. I began to view the film dubbed in English. I would not recommend this. View the version with the English subtitles, it looks much better and the language sounds beautiful. If you are one who always expects a happy ending, this film may not be for you. I was pleased with the way this film ended, as it did in the novel, realistically. The film is very true to the text and therefore I would recommend for one who has read and enjoyed the novel.
