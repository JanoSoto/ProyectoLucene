The brainchild of writer\/director Brian de Palma, PHANTOM was born of his fervent wish to do a musical. At the time of its creation, de Palma was still a critical darling with three previous films to his credit (GREETINGS, HI, MOM!, and his feverish and blackly funny ode to his spiritual mentor, Alfred Hitchcock, SISTERS.) Critical acclaim and box-office success are two very different things, however, and as much as he relished one, he also understood that he would have to achieve the other, in order to be able to continue making films at all. Although he would not reach his goal until well after this, tackling a teen horror film based on a novel by an aspiring author named Stephen King, PHANTOM inspired the director to reach for strokes of creative daring and cleverness that would mark very little of his later work. It also made a huge difference that his co- conspirator, pop tyro Paul Williams, was definitely on the same page when he composed the accompanying music, lyrics and evocative score. Even though another genre-and gender-blending film from Fox made that same year, would eventually overshadow PHANTOM in cult and box-office status, this overlooked gem deserved so much more attention than it got. Using a fantastic scenario to make sly, trenchant, tongue-in-cheek observations about the absurdity, excess and greed that defined the music business back in the Seventies, what it had to say about it all is - strangely enough - just as relevant today, and outlines the biting satire well before the advent of Rob Reiner's sublime THIS IS SPINAL TAP.A mash-up of Gaston LeRoux's timeless PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, FAUST, Wilde's DORIAN GRAY and a parody of several very popular bands and trends of the time, PHANTOM is first and foremost the story of naive and passionate composer Winslow Leach (de Palma favorite William Finley). Leach is seeking maximum exposure for his masterwork, a pop cantata based on the legend of Faust.Like the old saying goes, be careful what you wish for. 'Wunderkind' producer Swan (Williams, whose character is based in part on Phil Spector, which was more accurate than anybody knew at the time) has been in search of the perfect music to crown his latest achievement - the opening of the Paradise, a super-sized music venue for everything from glam-rock to nostalgic do-wop. Thanks to a nefarious scheme cooked up with his toady, Philbin (the late George Memmoli), Swan steals Winslow's music and has him locked up on a trumped-up drug charge. Incensed, Winslow escapes with vengeance on his mind, but his plan backfires when a freak accident leads to facial disfigurement in a record press, he is wounded by a security guard and allegedly drowns. Now armed with the stolen songs, Swan next seeks out someone extraordinary to sing them, and what he finds is two performers the winsome Phoenix (SUSPIRIA star Jessica Harper in her debut role), a backup singer who Winslow developed a crush on, and bisexual screamer Beef (the excellent Gerrit Graham), a conglomeration of Mick Jagger, Rod Stewart, Elton John, David Bowie and every other flamboyant rocker you can name. But there is indeed trouble in Paradise - Winslow, not as dead as originally thought, dons a mask and cape and stalks the theater, with murder on his mind and a tireless determination to finish the job on Swan. The devilish producer strikes an uneasy bargain with his Phantom - stop his reign of terror, finish the cantata and Swan will have Phoenix sing it. Winslow agrees, but doesn't tumble to Swan's plans to pull a bait-and-switch with Beef until later.

The engagement of American and other Allied Nations in Europe, the Far East, the Pacific and North Africa was enough of a living horror. Interestingly, or perhaps intentionally, any mention of the War is missing from this Contemporary storyline.WE find it further to be an example of totally unfettered irony that the Film is a co-production of the distributor, Universal Pictures; who also released the production. It was Universal, of course, who made its great fame and fortune by producing such classic works of Horror as Lon Chaney's starring vehicles THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (1923) and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (19??). Moving into the Sound Era, it was Carl Lemmaele's home studio that gave us Bela Lugosi in Dracula (1931), Boris Karloff as the Monster in FRANKENSTEIN (also '31) and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935); as well as his portrayal of Im-Ho-Tep in THE MUMMY (1932). Further examples of fine works of Gothic Horror are THE WEREWOLF OF London (1935), THE WOLFMAN (1941); as well as a whole sh*t house full of sequels, spin-offs and All-Star Monster fest crossovers.OBVIOUSLY, Alfred Hitchcock's SHADOW OF A DOUBT (Skirbill Productions\/Universal Pictures, 1943) made for a very different sort of Horror Picture; albeit one that should be all the more frightening, for it could happen.HITCH takes a very fine cast and puts them through their paces in the sort of manner to which we have become accustomed. The interplay among the main characters is near perfection; with the cast featuring Young Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright), Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten ), Detective Jack Graham (MacDonald Carey in his first featured role), Joseph Newton (Henry Travers), Emma Newton (Patricia Collinge), Detective Fred Saunders (Wallace Ford) and a supporting cast of what, hundreds? Some outstanding work is in evidence by some great Character Actors (Face Players). Among them is a very pivotal performance by veteran Clarence Muse as a Pullman Porter and a young Hume Cronyn, in his film debut as the Newton's neighbor and detective novel fanatic, Herbie Hawkins.WE have read that Sir Alfred designed the whole to be a view of the darker side of Life; which even exists on Main Street USA, in our Small Towns. Allegedly this was spurned on by the adaptation of Thornton Wilder's Broadway Drama, OUR TOWN (Sol Lesser's Principal Pictures\/United Artists Corporation, 1940)* to the Silver Screen. Indeed, we can fully understand how an offbeat sort of approach, which may well not have translated into big (bleepin') deal Box Office $ucce$$; but surely inspired a degree of Cult Status and Following.THIS inclusion of a huge talent such as Thornton Wilder is certainly a true feather in the cap of the whole Hitchcock Production Team; as the name alone certainly would elevate any Production, even a Three Stooges 2 reeler comedy, to the level above any cinematic endeavour.

Though Jonathan Demme's film is not perfect, it still brilliantly outshines most of the crud made back then. Something Wild is the study of two souls who seem to come from different worlds going on a crazy road trip full of sex, violence, and even a high school reunion.It all begins inside a tiny diner in New York City when openly free-spirited Audrey (Melanie Griffith) notices yuppie Charlie (Jeff Daniels) sneak out on paying his bill. She confronts him outside, and the two of them end up jumping in her car and taking off on a sunny Friday afternoon. At first it would seem that this trip across the state line will merely end in a sexual tryst in a cheap motel, but little does Charlie know, Audrey has all sorts of plans for him that weekend. After some serious hanky-panky, Audrey takes Charlie back to her home town, introduces him to her mother as her husband, and then takes him to her high school reunion. In a development a little bit contrived for this critic's liking, one of Charlie's co-workers also happens to be attending this reunion. This could potentially destroy the facade of the family man on a wild weekend that Charlie is trying to perpetrate. (at this point we learn his wife left him quite a while ago) Further complicating matters is the arrival of Audrey's psychotic ex-husband, played with fearsome intensity by Ray Liotta. From that point on, this film which has largely gone for laughs, becomes rather intense and often violent.This film scores major points by absolutely keeping the audience guessing. At least until the third act when the film can likely conclude in no other way than it does. The film avoids making Charlie out to be a totally predictable sap who is just along for a wild ride with a crazy woman. Charlie has his own secrets, and a whole hidden side of his own that comes out when it has to. Demme places some marginally famous people in some truly odd cameos, and spends a little bit more time with peripheral characters than some people would. It gives the film a very human kind of feeling as we get to know at least a little something about even someone working as a waitress or at a motel. The film maybe meanders a bit here and there, but that is understandable since so much of it plays out like a road trip. The actors are exceptional, and the film is full of color and energy.

With a new partner named Kevin McCall (Michael Rapaport) to show the ropes too Roper becomes obsessed with tracking his friends killer down & eventually does so when he arrests Korda after he had robbed a jewellery store. However Korda wants revenge & targets Roper's girlfriend Veronica (Carmen Ejogo) when he breaks out of prison...Directed by Thomas Carter this run of the mill Hollywood action cop comedy thriller is an alright way to spend a couple of hours but isn't anything original or spectacular. The script by co-producer Randy Feldman includes every Hollywood comedy cop thriller clichés you care to think of, there's the whole mismatched partner angle, there's a wise-cracking hot-shot lead cop character who plays by his own rules & seemingly does very little police work, there's the one-liners & comeback's, there's the disgruntled police Captain who gets annoyed a lot, there's a really nasty bad guy who kills someone close to said cop & thereby makes it personal, there's the whole vendetta thing that flows through the film & there's a typical climactic showdown in which the cop kills the bad guy & gets the girl. Yawn. There really isn't anything in Metro that any action fan wouldn't have seen before & I seriously doubt there's anything in Metro that the average person wouldn't have seen before either. At almost two hours in length the film goes on for too long & it's just all so predictable & routine but it is saved by some impressive big budget action set-pieces & a fairly fun performance by Murphy who has turned swearing into an art form.For the majority of the duration of Metro the film is unremarkable although it passes the time harmlessly enough but I will admit there are a few great action sequences in it. In particular there's a terrific part which starts with a jewellery story robbery, a spectacular car chase through San Francisco featuring a runaway tram & ending in some more car stunts & a stand off in a parking garage which lasts for a good fifteen or twenty minutes in total although I did wonder where all the other cops in San Francisco were. There's some more good car stunts & explosions at the end but how is Roper going to explain all the jewels he 'borrowed' to get his girlfriend back being blown to pieces in the truck along with Korda? Also doesn't Korda escape from prison a bit too easily? OK so he makes it into the laundry room but there are still plenty of locked doors & police guards to get past even at that point. There's some violence & plenty of bad language to help pass the time but it all felt like I had seen it many times before.With a supposed budget of about $55,000,000 Metro is well made with solid big budget Hollywood production values. The acting is alright, Murphy does his Beverly Hills Cop (1984) cop with attitude type thing & he comes out with a few amusing one-liners but his character is very thinly written & fleshed out. The only other cast members to stand out are Michael Wincott as Korda the bad guy & he puts in an intense performance & British actress Carmen Ejogo who I thought was terrible.Metro is a throughly routine & predictable comedy cop action thriller the likes of which we have all seen before & usually better, it's not the worst of it's kind & several impressive set-piece action scenes help a lot but it's not up there with the best of it's kind. Average at best but action film fans should still like it.

With a new partner named Kevin McCall (Michael Rapaport) to show the ropes too Roper becomes obsessed with tracking his friends killer down & eventually does so when he arrests Korda after he had robbed a jewellery store. However Korda wants revenge & targets Roper's girlfriend Veronica (Carmen Ejogo) when he breaks out of prison...Directed by Thomas Carter this run of the mill Hollywood action cop comedy thriller is an alright way to spend a couple of hours but isn't anything original or spectacular. The script by co-producer Randy Feldman includes every Hollywood comedy cop thriller clichés you care to think of, there's the whole mismatched partner angle, there's a wise-cracking hot-shot lead cop character who plays by his own rules & seemingly does very little police work, there's the one-liners & comeback's, there's the disgruntled police Captain who gets annoyed a lot, there's a really nasty bad guy who kills someone close to said cop & thereby makes it personal, there's the whole vendetta thing that flows through the film & there's a typical climactic showdown in which the cop kills the bad guy & gets the girl. Yawn. There really isn't anything in Metro that any action fan wouldn't have seen before & I seriously doubt there's anything in Metro that the average person wouldn't have seen before either. At almost two hours in length the film goes on for too long & it's just all so predictable & routine but it is saved by some impressive big budget action set-pieces & a fairly fun performance by Murphy who has turned swearing into an art form.For the majority of the duration of Metro the film is unremarkable although it passes the time harmlessly enough but I will admit there are a few great action sequences in it. In particular there's a terrific part which starts with a jewellery story robbery, a spectacular car chase through San Francisco featuring a runaway tram & ending in some more car stunts & a stand off in a parking garage which lasts for a good fifteen or twenty minutes in total although I did wonder where all the other cops in San Francisco were. There's some more good car stunts & explosions at the end but how is Roper going to explain all the jewels he 'borrowed' to get his girlfriend back being blown to pieces in the truck along with Korda? Also doesn't Korda escape from prison a bit too easily? OK so he makes it into the laundry room but there are still plenty of locked doors & police guards to get past even at that point.

When his partner is put in a wheelchair by a criminal and another officer is shot dead, Nishi finds himself plagued by guilt over his part in it all. Blaming himself Nishi tries to do the right thing by his partner Horibe and the widow of cop, while also trying to salvage some happiness in what remains of his time with his wife.I came back to Takeshi Kitano about the same time as I left the Movies You Should See podcast. I left it because I don't think it is as good as it could be and at times offers no real insight into a film other than describing bits however I give them a mention because they reminded me that I had only ever seen one or two of Kitano's films and that it had been some time since I had even seen those. So it was that after watching Brother, my rental site threw me Hana-Bi and I was looking forward to it due to the praise on this site and indeed the podcast itself. The expectation was not unjustified as Hana-Bi is a film of pain and beauty that is well worth seeing even if it is not the image of perfection that some would have you believe.That statement is bound to attract a low vote on IMDb but what can I tell you? That it was slow and quiet is not a problem for me but it is a feeling you get watching the film and it is not helped by some scenes feeling irrelevant within the context of the story. This is not a real killer but I felt that the slow pace needed support and seeing two minor characters argue about a fender bender (for example) saw my interest dip and the slow pace start to be felt. Otherwise though, the silence and pace suits the material and the style of the film. The violence is quite subdued (in regards what you actually see) because it occurs in the edit of the action &#150; so the actual impact is mostly unseen. It doesn't matter though because the main thrust of the film is less the outward violence but the internal suffering of all the characters. The film does wear this aspect a little heavily at times and some will feel that some sequences are right on the edge of being pretentious and there is no point in denying that it does walk this line here and there.However for the majority it is a really well observed and emotionally engaging story built on the silent but emotive presence of Kitano as writer, director and star. As writer he has, it could be argued, left a lot to the actual making process itself since the script must have been a few pages. As director he sets the pace and I like the way his static style works within this story but it is his work as actor that always mystifies and impresses me. How he can convey so much while also appearing to be doing nothing at all I'm not sure but it somehow works and fits his style in other disciplines. He is well supported by Kishimoto, with whom he has genuine chemistry without betraying his character's nature. Osugi is not that great and it is with his character that I found the film close to being pretentious, not the actor's fault of course but I never felt for him as I did for Nishi.Hana-Bi is very slow and quiet and I can totally understand why some viewers will throw it in very early on. However sticking with it reveals a film that manages to be violent, introspective and emotionally engaging at the same time, all wrapped in the style of Kitano, who is creative across the board.

Today, however, is when I saw the movie, and it's sad for me to see how much of the film hasn't aged very well. Not so much all of the special and visual effects; most of the exterior space shots and the repetitive (sometime too repetitive) shots of the Valley Forge ship drifting along, as well as that quick and trippy thrill-ride through the Saturn rings, are very well done for its time and work for the sake of the movie's own reality of sorts. Just little things, like, say, all of the Joan Baez songs, which screeches the mood to a halt with its hippy-dippy flavor (unless, of course, you're into that sort of thing).That, and the fact that it being Douglas Trumbull's first film as a director (he's a well-deserved Oscar nominee for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and has his name proudly stamped forever on 2001 and Blade Runner as a special effects man), and whether it was his call or that of the director of photography, Charles F. Wheeler, to shoot a lot of the interiors like it was for television (sometimes they're creative with it, but for the most part it's almost too basic for its own good). So, there are things like that, and a few little scenes (mostly early on with character actors Cliff Potts, Ron Rifkin and Jesse Vint) that fall flat. And yet... this is definitely, when it's at its best, one of the most unusual and curious pieces in the genre from the period, or maybe any. Taking aside the pro-environment message of the film, it's a really excellent story about a man going over that certain edge, and being possessive of the very thing that should be shared with the world.It's a complex character that the writers, Cimino, Bochco and Washburn have created here with Freeman Lowell (Bruce Dern), so much so that he's both very complex and too simple-minded to figure on. He loves his forest and his trees, worked on it for 8 years, and is told at the drop of a dime to let it all go and the plans for repopulating the Earth with actual greenery is done with, and it's back to a pat return to 75-degree all-the-time normalcy. He snaps, kills his co-pilots, and tries his best to break off contact with his boss ships.

All he has, apparently, are three strange, almost kinda cute robots he names Huey, Dewey and (after the fact of losing him around Saturn's rings) Louie, who do tasks all over the ship.What the film lacks in directorial polish, therefore, is made-up in spades by the wonderful story and this character who, for 2\/3 of the movie, is the only human we see on screen. It's so crucial then that the one consistently brilliant aspect is Bruce Dern's performance.

While The Road Warrior remains undoubtedly my favorit, the film I remember least from the trilogy was surprisingly Mad Max 1.Now, I recently purchased the DVD set which retains the original Australian audio for Mad Max 1 and what do I think of it after some 14 years later?

The prison is run by Warden Hazen, a football nut who spies an opportunity to utilise Crewe's ability at the sport to enhance the prison guards team skills. After initially declining to help, Crewe is swayed into putting together a team of convicts to take on the guards in a one off match, thieves, murderers and psychopaths collectively come together to literally, beat the guards, but Crewe also has his own personal demons to exorcise.This violent, but wonderfully funny film has many things going for it. Directed with style by the gifted hands of Robert Aldrich, The Longest Yard cheekily examines the harshness of gridiron and fuses it with the brutality of the penal system. The script from Tracy Keenan Wynn is a sharp as a tack and Aldrich's use of split screens and slow motion sequences bring it all together very nicely indeed. I would also like to comment on the editing from Michael Luciano, nominated for the Oscar in that department, it didn't win, but in my honest opinion it's one of the best edited pictures from the 70s.Taking the lead role of Crewe is Burt Reynolds, here he is at the peak of his powers perhaps never better and has star appeal positively bristling from every hair on his rugged chest. It's a great performance, believable in the action sequences he was once a halfback for Florida, and crucially having the comic ability to make Wynn's script deliver the necessary mirth quota. What is of most interest to me is that Crewe is a less than honourable guy, the first 15 minutes of the film gives us all we need to know about his make up, but much like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest the following year, The Longest Yard has us rooting for the main protagonist entering the home straight, and that is something of a testament to Reynolds' charm and charisma.The film's crowning glory is the football game itself, taking up three parts of an hour, the highest compliment I can give it is to say that one doesn't need to be a fan of the sport to enjoy this final third. It's highly engaging as a comedy piece whilst also being octane inventive as an action junkie series of events.

I remember seeing it shortly after it first came out in 1995 and being enthralled by the story, dialogue, and characters, then came the punchline at the end! No matter, I still think of it as a fascinating piece of film-making. Because of the trick ending, it is debatable as to what is real or not in the film. If you watch it objectively, it is just a damn entertaining, complex, well-plotted film noir piece with an exciting climax. If you take the subjective route, which you pretty much have to because of the ending, then what you've got is perhaps the most puzzling film ever made, one that even with multiple repeated viewings will make you second (and third and fourth, etc.) guess yourself. Regardless, THE USUAL SUSPECTS is one spectacular film! THE USUAL SUSPECTS starts off with the film's supposed protagonist, Dean Keaton (terrifically played by Gabriel Byrne), being assassinated by a mysterious figure (unseen to the viewer) named 'Keyser'. I think it's safe to say that this opening scene is objectively told. It really happened. Then Keyser burns the ship that Keaton and a bunch of other men (who we find out about later) are on. In the immediate aftermath of the incident, the cops and FBI question the sole survivor of this massacre, Verbal Kint (played by Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner Kevin Spacey). Verbal is the only one who can tell what happened. He is our link to the story of THE USUAL SUSPECTS.Leading the investigation is US Customs Agent Dave Kujon (effectively played by Chazz Palmentieri). Kujon grills Kint relentlessly in order to piece together all the events that led up to the massacre. Kint begins with the events weeks before when Kujon and his fellow agents had arrested Keaton and the other 'usual' suspects Kint, Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio del Toro), and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak). These 5 men were suspected of a hijacking and were brought in for questioning.As Kint continues and the film progresses, we find that the 5 criminals were manipulated into the situation by Keyser Soze, a Hungarian uber-gangster\/drug dealer who they all think is really a myth until his #1 lackey Kobyashi (played with cold efficiency by Pete Posthlewaite) pays them a visits after their release from jail and tells them that indeed Soze is behind all this. Soze wants them to to do job for him by killing his Hungarian competitors, who are making a huge drug deal with some Argentinians on a ship docked in LA. This leads us to the climax and back to the events that started the film.THE USUAL SUSPECTS, whatever one's feelings about the surprise at the end, is one brilliant example of modern day film noir. Nobody is innocent, yet every major character is multi-dimensional and draws you into the story. There is quite a bit of action and violence, but it is tight, well-placed, and quite convincing. The beauty of the film is that you can watch it at least two different ways objectively to be entertained and subjectively to try to figure out what the heck is really going on!

I highly recommend it. To give a little background to those who have not seen Space Seed, the Enterprise happens upon a lost spacecraft which holds Khan (Ricardo Montalban) in hibernation. Upon freeing him, Captain Kirk (William Shatner), Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) learn that Khan was once a dictator on Earth. Facing defeat, he and his closest allies fled to space. That information comes too late, as Khan has already re-routed the ship's controls in an effort to take it over. After beating him in a fistfight, Kirk drops the criminal charges against Khan and his crew. Upon request, Kirk allows them to colonize Ceti Alpha V, but they have no way to leave.Fifteen years later, the USS Reliant approaches Ceti Alpha VI while looking for lifeless planets. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch), a former lover of Kirk, and their son David (Merritt Butrick) have created Genesis, a device meant to create life but also capable of great destruction. While scouting the surface, Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Reliant Captain Terrell (Paul Winfield) encounter Khan. As it turns out, Ceti Alpha VI exploded and altered the orbit of Alpha V, wiping out most of Khan's followers. Khan steals Reliant and sets up an ingenious sting for an unsuspecting Kirk, using Genesis as the bait.Although some later villains come close, none can match Khan, and there never may be one who will. He has changed since we last saw him. Back then he was charming and lively. An Enterprise Lieutenant defected to his side because of the vision and inspiration he offered her. He projected arrogance as he fought Kirk.Only parts of that man remain after fifteen years. Kirk never returned to see their desperate situation, and Khan holds an ocean of bitterness and resentment. Retribution has become his singular focus. When a crew member suggests that he does not need to kill Kirk, he responds, He tasks me, and I must have him! I'll chase around the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares Maelstrom and 'round perdition's flames before I give him up! Aside from Dr. Soran, Khan is the most intelligent of the Trek villains, and not even Soran matches his passion.Montalban's splendid, inspired acting completes the character. Khan's old personality surfaces only once, when he thinks he has Kirk at his mercy. Montalban embodies it just as well he did in 1967. At the other moments, he is equally adept. We see the pain raking his face and hear it pollute his voice when he must let the Enterprise flee, and when he informs Kirk of his plan to strand him, and again as he catches up with the Enterprise, when he refuses to end his pursuit no matter what the circumstances and when he literally spits his final words of hatred. Montalban works effectively with his eyes and breathing to display Khan's state of mind. Intimately evaluating acting with words alone is nearly impossible. Were I to use a structured grading sheet, Montalban would receive and A.Another critical element is the clashing, but close friendship between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Their differing personalities, which provide the best moments of the series, were mostly absent from The Motion Picture. Now they return. McCoy can call Spock a green-blooded inhuman one moment and become roused with concern for his safety another. Kirk and Spock understand each other so well that even Lt. Saavik (a well-casted Kirstie Alley), a fellow Vulcan and student of Spock's, cannot understand what their words mean. It is a fortunate fact that the movie can stand on its characters because the Space Battles, although necessary, are sorely limited by the budget. It is under one-third of the The Motion Picture's. When the starships attack and evade each other, they are mostly shown up close. They either move in straight lines or slow turns. The final blast, which ILM had to build a new device to capture, likely siphoned a large portion of the money away from action and limited sets. Director Nicholas Meyer compensates by focusing on the strategic aspect, particularly in the final encounter.This movie is all about its dynamic characters and conflicts, which hold it up by themselves. It seals its status as a classic with the ending, which I will not reveal although probably everybody knows it by now. All action needs good conflict, but sometimes conflict alone suffices. An action film without strong action is usually bad, but here is one that not only survives, but thrives.

I highly recommend it. To give a little background to those who have not seen Space Seed, the Enterprise happens upon a lost spacecraft which holds Khan (Ricardo Montalban) in hibernation. Upon freeing him, Captain Kirk (William Shatner), Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) learn that Khan was once a dictator on Earth. Facing defeat, he and his closest allies fled to space. That information comes too late, as Khan has already re-routed the ship's controls in an effort to take it over. After beating him in a fistfight, Kirk drops the criminal charges against Khan and his crew. Upon request, Kirk allows them to colonize Ceti Alpha V, but they have no way to leave.Fifteen years later, the USS Reliant approaches Ceti Alpha VI while looking for lifeless planets. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch), a former lover of Kirk, and their son David (Merritt Butrick) have created Genesis, a device meant to create life but also capable of great destruction. While scouting the surface, Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Reliant Captain Terrell (Paul Winfield) encounter Khan. As it turns out, Ceti Alpha VI exploded and altered the orbit of Alpha V, wiping out most of Khan's followers. Khan steals Reliant and sets up an ingenious sting for an unsuspecting Kirk, using Genesis as the bait.Although some later villains come close, none can match Khan, and there never may be one who will. He has changed since we last saw him. Back then he was charming and lively. An Enterprise Lieutenant defected to his side because of the vision and inspiration he offered her. He projected arrogance as he fought Kirk.Only parts of that man remain after fifteen years. Kirk never returned to see their desperate situation, and Khan holds an ocean of bitterness and resentment. Retribution has become his singular focus. When a crew member suggests that he does not need to kill Kirk, he responds, He tasks me, and I must have him! I'll chase around the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares Maelstrom and 'round perdition's flames before I give him up!

Hmm ,well on first glance they appear to be odd bedfellows, but strip away the formers' high concept blockbusters and you can see traits that bring the two giants together. Debate will rage forever about if Spielberg's finished product is in line with what Kubrick had envisaged before sadly passing away to witness what he had asked Spielberg to mould. You can find hundreds of comments and philosophical arguments about the merits of Artificial Intelligence AI, this site alone has been party to aggressive discussion about its intelligent worth, with the ending alone particularly causing consternation to many. So with that in mind I don't wish to over do my brainiac leanings on this bleak and cold masterpiece, I just wish to jot down my emotional thoughts about how this film makes me feel.I love this film so much, I really do, which considering it leaves me feeling quite desolate, makes it even more of a interesting statement. What Spielberg has done here is take Kubrick's cold eloquent style and fused it with a sort of edgy Pinocchio meets 2001's meaning, this is in short the polar opposite to his own E.T fable. Considering that this story is played out thru a robot child's point of view, the subject matter is shatteringly adult, it resonates with grim violence as it poses many unanswerable questions. What does it mean to be real? Can we replicate ourselves into a synthetic being? And just how close can that being be to being perfect? Love and it's power, where is the cut off point where we can say they are only human traits? You could go quite mad thinking too hard about it, and this is one of Spielbeg's masterstrokes with the picture, he is not here to spoon feed us those thinking the ending is syrup are seriously misunderstanding it, he outlays his grim tale and asks us if we dare to ponder these prevalent questions.Hayley Joel Osment is David and it's a hauntingly brilliant show from the youngster, intensely creepy and borderline freaky. David demands empathy as his loving family union comes crashing down around his newly emotive life, and it's here when the film takes a tonal shift that Osment excels. This then brings the excellent Jude Law, as mecha sex robot Gigolo Joe, into David's world, and here the film on the surface goes jaunty, but it's merely a brief diversion from the film's core bleakness and is in fact adding to the head scratching nature of the beast. The visuals are wonderful, from the colour explosion that is Rouge City, to the underwater sequences in the final third, Spielberg not only dazzles with his tools, but also shows that he can fuse CGI with a serious storyline and let them benefit each other. Must give a nod of approval to John Williams' score, nominated for an Oscar but not winning, it is however memorable and intensely touching.Artificial Intelligence is not for everyone, I can see quite easily why it is so hotly debated time and time again, but the work on the film is brilliant, almost as brilliant as the dark grim nature of the picture's heart. I firmly believe that in time this film will be revered as a classic, while I'm also convinced that they will dissect it in film studies classes long after I have left this mortal coil.

That said we know she is something special when she is the only one left in the elevator on the way to the top. She is asked to go on an assignment by Jack Crawford, a senior figure at the Bureau to profile serial killers, perhaps, to help profile a new killer, Buffalo Bill, a man who skins his victims, different patterns each time and all dumped in different places. The Killer she is given the job of profiling is the one that will not co-operate, the infamous killer Hannibal Lector, formerly a renowned psychiatrist before he went off the rails towards the siding known as insanity.And so Clarice begins a series of interviews with Lector where they both attempt a kind of intellectual and emotional sparring as they try to find out more about each other. As they get to know each other, with Clarice giving more in terms of info and Lector giving more in terms of soul they become unwitting colleagues in the race to stop Bill adding to his list of victims. This film is a modern classic in every sense of the word. The colour seems to have been bled from every frame leading to a drab and desolate world without hope or sympathy. The use of symbolism is some of the best I've ever seen with the bug motif occurring throughout and not just in terms of the killer's signature, be aware of how his eyes look in the night vision goggles, we know that Bees can see in ultra violet and the way in which his vision is turned into one colour is extremely bug-like, however the big parallel with bugs is at the end of the film (Spoiler alert) when we see the figure dying on the floor with the night vision goggles on, with the wounds on both sides of his chest, he dies like an insect, something that many people may not notice.The film is also clever in its usage of more familiar symbolism to make us feel certain ways. As Bill's next victim is driving along we see her singing to a song on the radio, not just singing the main words but flitting between backing and the main lyrics, just the way we all do, making us far more concerned than we would be if she was just driving home, by showing her doing what we all do, she becomes us and we fear far more for her future fate.However, this is not just a film about symbolism, this is a film about the decisions that we make and the decisions that we are forced to make. Clarice is sent on a path to the FBI after the death of her father, he was her world and all she seeks is his approval and by following in his footsteps it is the closest she can think to do that, this is a decision made by circumstance that is unavoidable, and she has no regrets over it. Hannibal by contrast goes fruit loop after dealing with endless whingy whiny patients with no problems when what he wants to do is deal with interesting problems. Somewhere along the way his mind snaps and the discussions that he would have no doubt enjoyed with Clarice are soured by the fact that there are bars between them, this regret is clearly etched on his face when they discus serial killers and Clarice says, so impassively, No, you ate yours, she knows what he is and he doesn't impress her like his mighty intellect should, because he is a killer and to her that is all he is, and, as he realises this and looks away it is this regret that is revealing. Lector loves battling or discussing intellectual matters with equals, and so few ever came his way, and the regret he feels over meeting Clarice clearly too late is portrayed beautifully by Anthony Hopkins who gives the performance of a lifetime in giving us this killer who still contains within him a human soul.This is the glory of this performance, although people have pointed out that his screen time is more warranting a supporting actor nod, there was simply no finer male performance, supporting or otherwise, and perhaps one of the greatest pieces of luck that the film enjoyed was Gene Hackman turning the role down. Anthony Hopkins doesn't just perform Lector, he inhabits him and we get treated to an amazing piece of acting that shows us that Serial Killers, the worst kind of people that there are, are still people, and that this is perhaps the saddest thing about them.To add to this great performance Jodie Foster not only gave a good performance but matched Hopkins perfectly, showing all of Clarice's strength's and vulnerability with such stunning realism that we feel almost every shiver that goes through her skin as she trawls society's bottom step in order to stop a monster feasting endlessly on victims that society does not care much about. Scott Glenn rounds off this acting triumvirate with a measured controlled performance that exactly matches his character.Jonathan Demme's direction is superb, the music compliments every scene with an uneasy balance that never allows you to settle in your seat and the script is first rate. After I thought about this film and considered how good it was I tried to think of some reason to give it a nine, and I couldn't. This film really is a ten and although the subject matter is not everyone's cup of tea, it is worthwhile for those who have a hard enough stomach.

She is asked to go on an assignment by Jack Crawford, a senior figure at the Bureau to profile serial killers, perhaps, to help profile a new killer, Buffalo Bill, a man who skins his victims, different patterns each time and all dumped in different places. The Killer she is given the job of profiling is the one that will not co-operate, the infamous killer Hannibal Lector, formerly a renowned psychiatrist before he went off the rails towards the siding known as insanity.And so Clarice begins a series of interviews with Lector where they both attempt a kind of intellectual and emotional sparring as they try to find out more about each other. As they get to know each other, with Clarice giving more in terms of info and Lector giving more in terms of soul they become unwitting colleagues in the race to stop Bill adding to his list of victims. This film is a modern classic in every sense of the word. The colour seems to have been bled from every frame leading to a drab and desolate world without hope or sympathy. The use of symbolism is some of the best I've ever seen with the bug motif occurring throughout and not just in terms of the killer's signature, be aware of how his eyes look in the night vision goggles, we know that Bees can see in ultra violet and the way in which his vision is turned into one colour is extremely bug-like, however the big parallel with bugs is at the end of the film (Spoiler alert) when we see the figure dying on the floor with the night vision goggles on, with the wounds on both sides of his chest, he dies like an insect, something that many people may not notice.The film is also clever in its usage of more familiar symbolism to make us feel certain ways. As Bill's next victim is driving along we see her singing to a song on the radio, not just singing the main words but flitting between backing and the main lyrics, just the way we all do, making us far more concerned than we would be if she was just driving home, by showing her doing what we all do, she becomes us and we fear far more for her future fate.However, this is not just a film about symbolism, this is a film about the decisions that we make and the decisions that we are forced to make. Clarice is sent on a path to the FBI after the death of her father, he was her world and all she seeks is his approval and by following in his footsteps it is the closest she can think to do that, this is a decision made by circumstance that is unavoidable, and she has no regrets over it. Hannibal by contrast goes fruit loop after dealing with endless whingy whiny patients with no problems when what he wants to do is deal with interesting problems. Somewhere along the way his mind snaps and the discussions that he would have no doubt enjoyed with Clarice are soured by the fact that there are bars between them, this regret is clearly etched on his face when they discus serial killers and Clarice says, so impassively, No, you ate yours, she knows what he is and he doesn't impress her like his mighty intellect should, because he is a killer and to her that is all he is, and, as he realises this and looks away it is this regret that is revealing. Lector loves battling or discussing intellectual matters with equals, and so few ever came his way, and the regret he feels over meeting Clarice clearly too late is portrayed beautifully by Anthony Hopkins who gives the performance of a lifetime in giving us this killer who still contains within him a human soul.This is the glory of this performance, although people have pointed out that his screen time is more warranting a supporting actor nod, there was simply no finer male performance, supporting or otherwise, and perhaps one of the greatest pieces of luck that the film enjoyed was Gene Hackman turning the role down. Anthony Hopkins doesn't just perform Lector, he inhabits him and we get treated to an amazing piece of acting that shows us that Serial Killers, the worst kind of people that there are, are still people, and that this is perhaps the saddest thing about them.To add to this great performance Jodie Foster not only gave a good performance but matched Hopkins perfectly, showing all of Clarice's strength's and vulnerability with such stunning realism that we feel almost every shiver that goes through her skin as she trawls society's bottom step in order to stop a monster feasting endlessly on victims that society does not care much about. Scott Glenn rounds off this acting triumvirate with a measured controlled performance that exactly matches his character.Jonathan Demme's direction is superb, the music compliments every scene with an uneasy balance that never allows you to settle in your seat and the script is first rate. After I thought about this film and considered how good it was I tried to think of some reason to give it a nine, and I couldn't. This film really is a ten and although the subject matter is not everyone's cup of tea, it is worthwhile for those who have a hard enough stomach.
