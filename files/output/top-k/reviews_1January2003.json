Penn plays Sam who has a mental capacity of a seven year old. He is raising a daughter with the help of a neighbor and three friends. The friends are also mentally challenged. The problem Sam has is his daughter, played by Dakota Fanning, is growing older and is getting smarter then her father. Social Services sees this as a problem and takes her away. Penn talks to an attorney, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, to help him get his daughter back. She eventually agrees to give her services for free. In a nutshell, the plot of the movie is a fathers love for his daughter and he will do anything to stay with her. For a young actor, Fanning gives a strong performance and almost steals the show. There is some strong language, mostly by Pfeiffer, but that doesn't distract from the movie. This is a heartwarming movie and if you like a good drama, I highly recommend it. I give it a 10 on a scale of 1-10 and you will see why once you have seen the movie.

Before, I used to get overwhelmed and think that there was no true depth to this film and thought it was just an attempt for Baz Luhrmann to establish himself as a unique film-making style. Turns out, it's not in his pace of film-making, but in the style of his shots that seem to encompass a world in and of itself that sets him apart from flash in the pan directors like Michael Bay and McG.The film tells a heartbreaking tale of true love and how it transcends the boundaries of materialism and set standards. We have idealist Christian (Ewan McGreggor) who comes to Paris in 1899 to find his voice as a writer. As he meets a gala of colorful roommates who take him to the Moulin Rouge to pitch his play, he sees Satine, the crown jewel of the cabaret, and is instantly captivated by her. But unlike the other men who are put under her spell, Christian can see what Satine has hidden from everyone else and he falls in love with her. After Christian shows Satine that life (and love) can and does exist outside of the Moulin Rouge, they begin their love affair. But Satine is constantly dragged back into her world by The Duke who simply wants to buy her with material possessions.What the film has to say about love is that it can transcend any drudgery and elevate those whose hearts are filled with it. Even in the darkest of places where love is available to the highest bidder as one song suggests, if you truly love someone for who they are, then love can exist anywhere.Bax Luhrman creates a 17th-18th centuary like we've never seen, where the colors are vivid, the lighting has as many spotlights as it does shadows and the pace is more frentic than today's hustle and bustle. Though at times the songs and pace can seem out of place, it only helps to create one man's vision of the times. Luhrman's style may not be liked by many, but one cannot deny that it is his own.At first, I enjoyed Moulin Rouge, but then the pace grew so fast for me that I became exhausted with it and couldn't find the depth that I once saw in it. Then watching it again on DVD on my TV has shown me that this is the best way to watch this movie so as not to be overwhelmed by the the big screen, but seen in widescreen so the TV won't cut out every facet of this festival for the eyes and ears.Despite the ending, one can't help but feel grateful that love had existed, helped someone achieve their dream and give them the sense of freedom. And in doing that, Luhrman and company have truly embodied and modernized the Bohemian mantra of Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love.

(This review may contain some spoilers).1) Now, for me, the greatest thing about the Turtles hasn't been the plots necessarily, not even the turtles themselves! The greatest thing for me was believe it or not - Splinter!! Who could forget that great speech he gave to Raphael? Or the telepathic one later on? He was the source main reason that the first film had any decent emotional content. That perfectly voiced Japanese sensei who puts Yoda to shame (for me). The turtles look up to him always, they love him, his father figure is perfect for the father-son elements of part one.Now watching part 3, I've come to realise that they did alot to make Splinter what he was, the voice, the tone, the music accompanying his speech and of course, his dialogue; all was perfect. I know that because they totally left that behind for this film!!!! Splinter is now pitiful, what did they do to him???? He's a joke, almost a parody, he's terrible, AHHHH!!! Whenever he speaks I cringe and just hope he'll stop because I can't bare it anymore. Okay, since no-one else likes Splinter as much I'll stop that.2) I really wish someone hadn't mentioned to me that the turtles now look like frogs. It goes as far as ruining some scenes for me because it's so true. As a youngster, and even now, they'll be no way I can ever hate the turtle films because of simply the turtles' presence. It's good enough for me to love any film. That's definitely diminished in this one.3) Finally, another pretty minor and simple point. The music. I actually thought the music was great for the first two films (except for the soundtracks at the closing credits) but the classic turtle stuff has gone. I find myself perking up when I hear music from the first film in this one, but it's usually a 3 second clip.Okay, those may have been long winded negative points, but I don't really think this film is that bad. Before I get to the plot, it does have some redeeming points.First the action. It's always been hugely impressive to watch the guys in big turtle suits pull off so many martial arts moves so well. What was strange though, in the second movie was how obviously the fights were toned down. It was pretty stupid to see Leonardo's katanas remain in his shell for the whole film except once to put them through the ceiling and balance on them. Infact I don't remember seeing Mike's nunchuks at all in that film. All we saw was Donny's Bo.It's great to see the weapons back though. I liked the idea of the opening sequence of the guys showing their stuff, especially Mike and his pair of nunchuks. The fights are a bit gimmicky sometimes, and no their not martial arts movie material but their still good enough.Alright let's get to the plot. (((((SPOILERS!))))) Yes, going back in time the way they did is cheesy; yes, it was overall predictable. We know it was good to see Elias Koteas back as Casey (I'd have like Keno too).I definitely think it could've used more twists. We saw Whit wanting to go to the future. So why couldn't the turtles have their business done, go back earlier, but in the confusion have Whit try to go back with them. Whit could then have made it to the future and Casey accidentally take his place in Japan, armed with his hockey stick of course. The turtles would then have to make a second trip to get him back. And then we have the basis for a better movie? Huh? Huh? Oh come on!! Koteas went through cutting his hair and everything, Casey and Whit should definitely have been more involved in a more unpredictable action\/adventure comedy thing!! I'm telling you!!!!Anyway, if you usually skip the meat of most reviews to see the conclusion at the end Well, there IS enjoyment to be had for turtle fans, just block out the stupid parts.

Infact I don't remember seeing Mike's nunchuks at all in that film. All we saw was Donny's Bo.It's great to see the weapons back though. I liked the idea of the opening sequence of the guys showing their stuff, especially Mike and his pair of nunchuks. The fights are a bit gimmicky sometimes, and no their not martial arts movie material but their still good enough.Alright let's get to the plot. (((((SPOILERS!))))) Yes, going back in time the way they did is cheesy; yes, it was overall predictable. We know it was good to see Elias Koteas back as Casey (I'd have like Keno too).I definitely think it could've used more twists. We saw Whit wanting to go to the future. So why couldn't the turtles have their business done, go back earlier, but in the confusion have Whit try to go back with them. Whit could then have made it to the future and Casey accidentally take his place in Japan, armed with his hockey stick of course. The turtles would then have to make a second trip to get him back. And then we have the basis for a better movie? Huh? Huh? Oh come on!! Koteas went through cutting his hair and everything, Casey and Whit should definitely have been more involved in a more unpredictable action\/adventure comedy thing!! I'm telling you!!!!Anyway, if you usually skip the meat of most reviews to see the conclusion at the end Well, there IS enjoyment to be had for turtle fans, just block out the stupid parts. I saw this in the cinema when I was young and loved it. That has to be the best thing about being a kid, you're not cynical, you don't get annoyed, you just never let stupid things in a movie spoil you're overall enjoyment.

The other characters are all rather two-dimensional.  The villain, Ortega, is a particularly  bland character.  Just your run-of-the-mill drug lord, with big ambitions.

I had no familiarity with the plot other than the description on the DVD box, but I wanted a sure fire movie that I wasn't going to regret renting.Well I can't say I regret renting it, but is this movie hokey or what?*** Spoilers below ? ***The dream sequence was unquestionably great. I loved it and was entirely willing to suspend my disbelief to allow the movie to tell it's story.Where it started to fall apart for me is when Sinatra is ordered to take sick leave. Give me a break with the train scene and Janet Leigh. Here we see a sweaty, vacant eyed, spastic middle-aged man, who can't even light a cigarette in front of a pretty girl. Now I never tried that ploy before, but it apparently worked for Janet because she can't wait to follow Franky out of the car and give him her home address, telephone number and where she works. Maybe guys who sweat, shake and talk without looking you in the eye once during the conversation appeal to some women, but I doubt that the technique would work well today.Equally as inane as the train scene is cab scene after the police station pickup. Janet explains to Sinatra that as soon as she got home after meeting sweaty Frank, the first thing she did was to tell her Fiance that their engagement was over. The girl was obviously smitten.Almost as unbelievable is the snakebite sequence where Lesley Parrish fortunately has brought along a supply of razor blades during her bike ride, so as to come to the aid of Harvey after his incident. I have no problem however with her removing her blouse to fashion an improvised tourniquet.One of my favorite parts of the movie was what must have been one of the first movie Kung-Fu action scenes ever filmed, when Frank takes on the yellow peril with oriental fighting techniques he obviously picked up in Korea.Aside from a few highlights in the movie the dream sequence, blouse removal and kung-fu segments, I seldom found myself 'riveted to my seat'. It was pretty obvious to me WHO Harvey was going to kill and when - well ahead of the actual killings. Trite and hokey - yes. Suspenseful?

It is easy to see how some think it is one of the best they've seen, and it is equally easy to see how some hate it. Other recent films like Magnolia, Mulholland Drive, Fight Club, Memento, and Donnie Darko have the same effect on viewers. Regardless of one's leanings, there is no question you have to watch this whole film intently, grasp every nuance, understand every conversation to be able to even discuss it intelligently. I like to view films like this, it is a good mental exercise that most films just don't provide.  On the opposite end of the spectrum is a film like Dumb and Dumber, which happens to be one of my favorites, but one which you can watch very leisurely and just enjoy, like a good piece of creamy fudge!!  -)CAUTION * SPOILERS follow, you may not want to read further if you have not yet seen Vanilla Sky, which gets its title from a painting.David (Tom Cruise) is a 30-something rich guy who seized 51% control of his corporation when both parents died in an accident, loves the ladies and shies away from commitment. During the film he is involved, apparently, with two women, a brunette (Penny Cruz) and a blonde (Cammy Diaz). He also has lucid dreams, sometimes starts having sex with one and finishes with the other. As he awakes his CD radio whispers wake up, sometimes in the voice of one, sometimes the other. It gets to where we, the audience, as well as David, cannot tell which is dream and which is reality.Another layer in the story is the psychologist (Kurt Russell) visiting David in his jail cell, David with mask on, the psychologist trying to find out what really happened, was there really a murder. Is the psychologist real, or just part of the dream? We see a crash that apparently kills the blonde and disfigures David. We see him arguing with a panel of surgeons about doing something to stop the headaches.  We see him meet a stranger, we find out David had signed up for a Life Extension program where they freeze your body and bring back your mind into lucid dreams. The audience can tell by the vanilla-colored sky when David is supposed to be in these dreams.At the climax, David is given a choice when he calls for tech support. He has been dreaming lucidly for 150 years, he can continue or he can come out of that state and into reality. He has control, it will become what he imagines (shades of 'What Dreams May Come'), so he jumps off the tall building he is on, as he lands we only see one eye open, and hear wake up, David and the film ends.I may watch it again before I return it to my library, but upon one viewing I find it impossible to precisely reconstruct a narrative. On the one hand, we could assume everything up to David waking up on the street, sleeping off a drinking binge, with the first vanilla sky we see, is real, and everything after is a lucid dream. Or, maybe everything between the first, early wake up and the last one, is a dream. Or some other combination. While I generally like for films to make sense, and feel that I am able to connect all the points, I don't feel that necessity here. The film was so very well done, just the entertainment of watching the story unfold and the pleasure of thinking about it afterward is worth it. The DVD is fine, although unspectacular. The extras I didn't find particularly interesting, unless you really like to see Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise behind the scenes and during the world premiere in Japan, with all the young Japanese girls acting like 1960 American teenagers seeing the Beetles for the first time.

The whole man-eating creature plot has been done a billion times before, but there is an entire new twist on this, because this movie is actually GOOD! Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, Brendan Gleeson, and Betty White star in LAKE PLACID, the man-eating crocodile creature flick that came out right around the same time DEEP BLUE SEA did. That is probably why DEEP BLUE SEA flopped so bad, because of this movie, which was a hell of a lot better.Fans of action adventures, the best movie of the genre has arrived! This movie is one of my favorites, and I will stand behind my claim that this movie is good. I guess the whole thing is just a manner of opinion.LAKE PLACID gets 5\/5 from me.

While the acting is not a problem, the direction and editing are terrible. I will concede that I have little use for Basquiat as an artist, but I also have no use for Jackson Pollack as an artist and the recent movie on his life was very good.  The problem was not the subject, it was the presentation.This film on Basquiat's life not only fails to leave you caring about Basquiat, but with about 20 minutes to go in the movie it honestly had me wishing someone would spring out from nowhere and murder Basquiat in some act of random violence which would at least end the film.Jump-cuts being used for no apparent effect, b-rolling of audio tracks of conversations that would have been happening only minutes prior to the time of the visual image on the screen, when NOTHING is happening in the visual image that advances the story.  This technique works great as a means of compressing time, showing a visual image to tell one part of a story, while simultaneously presenting audio from another time and place and allowing the viewer to absorb both in half the time.  But here it was used for NO purpose.In a later scene, in one of Basquiat's non-fatal heroin overdoses, we are shown what his girlfriend sees when she finds him with his heart temporarily stopped and we are to realize as she did that it was a drug overdose. Well, this is fine when you are watching on DVD and can go back to take a second look at the shot, but when the tight shot of the syringe is simply not tight at all and when the thing is shown amid clutter and for only a second and a half, (I timed it) the director and editor fail to allow us the opportunity to see what they are trying to show us.The movie has recurrent visual images of surfers and watersports that might have some great significance to Basquiat's life, but which the director fails to even begin to convey.  They might as well be random images on the screen.The movie, in a nutshell, stinks, and to see reviews here praising it make me wonder what planet the authors are from.This was the first directorial effort of Julian Schnabel, and it is amazing anyone else trusted him with their money or careers to direct another on in 2000.

It was a very attention drawing story with vivid imagery, a compelling descent into savage behavior with a strong lesson about values and ethics. I highly recommend the book to anyone.But here an immortal story has, amazingly enough, been made into a bad movie. It's as simple as that. I don't know about the simple movie viewer, but if you had just read the book, as I had, watching the movie would be complete torture.The book had eerie, colorful imagery that pulled in readers and compelling and disturbing scenes. Naturally, a movie adaption of a story on such an island in such a remote place begs for color and visual moods. However this movie was filmed in black and white which considerably dulls the intended atmosphere in several scenes. Too bad the '90s remake of Lord of the Flies completely sucked. It would have been a chance to make up for this flaw.The scenes are very poorly organized. Any tension, suspense, or compelling nature is lost because the screenplay and shots just don't flow well and the camera work is amateur and quite sloppy.And what really both amused and irritated me about this movie is the laughably poor acting from an inexperienced child cast. Yes it's true that they're only children, but there were and are films with good kid actors that could convincingly do character roles. The kids in this film are just embarrassing. They all sound like they're struggling to remember their lines or are trying to follow character directions but not quite knowing what to do. The cast is completely unconvincing, and their performance contributes greatly into making this the bad movie that it is (though it's not completely their fault as the direction and technical work is every bit as shameful and amateur, and besides the child cast from the '90s remake was every bit as horrible if not worse). By the way, you'll notice that the voices of some of the older kid actors change tone getting deeper and higher pitched in alternate scenes (this is particularly noticeable with Ralph). Yet another sign of poor organization and little thought into this movie.Overall, a lousy film, but definitely the right choice between the '60s and '90s version. If you're going to watch a movie adaption of William Golding's literary classic, this is the right version to watch as the '90s version is even worse, but the best choice would be to skip the movies altogether and just read the book. Go to your local bookstore, get the novel, turn to page one and get ready for one amazing trip.

The story is constructed to keep you constantly wondering what exactly is going on from beginning to end and the acting is so perfect that the performances mimic real life. Unfortunately Vanilla Sky is but a pale reflection of the film it so shamelessly attempts to copy.By taking what is meant to be a convoluted story and overexplaining it, Cameron Crowe dulls the impact significantly and turns it into an almost unintentional comedy.  The concept is far fetched and Amenabar was well aware of that when he wrote Abre los Ojos.  Apparently Crowe felt that the only way to keep an audience interested is by attempting to tie up every loose end to the point where it becomes redundant and completely uninteresting.  We understand what is happening almost an hour before it ends so why must it be consistenly drilled home?Unfortunately the real disappointment is in the performances.  Tom Cruise is no better than a dime store version of the original's Eduardo Noriega and Penelope Cruz lacks any of the charisma she had in the original.  Also, the intentions of all of the actors are so far from how the story is designed that it ruins any impact the film could have had.  The usually excellent Jason Lee was obviously given no direction and flounders aimlessly in his character.  Cameron Diaz is so abominable that she can't, even for a moment, convince me that she is even attempting to stay in character.

Some of the more recent movies just like this are DRIVE ME CRAZY, NEVER BEEN KISSED, 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU and there's millions of others. In this particular movie though, the stars are Freddie Prinze Jr, Rachael Leigh Cook, Matthew Lillard, Jodi Lynn O'Keefe, Usher Raymond, Kierian Culkan, Kevin Pollak, Tim Matheson, Eldon Henson, Anna Paquin, Susan May Pratt, Kimberly Lil Kim Jones, Paul Walker, and Clea Duvall. As you can tell, average teen talent that have starred in many others of these teen movies. The best thing to come from all of these repugnant comedies is the lovely farce NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE. And this movie was most of that movie's inspiration as it follows the plot.So, if you're into these romantic teen movies, this is probably a good choice. Now, I will admit there was some funny humor, but the moments that try to be dramatic were just dull and boring. Good choice for the teen movie lover.SHE'S ALL THAT gets 3\/5.
