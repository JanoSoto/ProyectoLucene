That will definitely put it within the top 10-15 highest grossing films this year. Very exciting! How many third part installments in a horror genre are this successful?!?!However, you have the usual number of skeptics who are afraid to say they enjoy such a film. Thats really too bad. They might be more comfortable renting Shakespeare in Love and laughing at just the right parts so all their friends can see how clever they are. If thats why you see a movie, well more power to you.Scream 3 transcends all genres. It does exactly what it wants, and does it well. It has thrills, definitely laughs, and a cast who looks like they are having a lot of fun. Parker Posey is hilarious!!! On opening night, everyone in the packed theatre was having a great time. Isn't that why we go to the movies? No, my life wasn't changed by this film, but did you expect this to be a life altering film? Heck, I enjoyed American Pie for what it was, but it didn't change my life, or the way I look at film.I think people expect too much from a movie these days. I want to help people to understand Scream 3. Some people think, well, I laughed a lot and I wasn't really scared, so it must have been a bad movie. This is an inaccurate assessment. The movie definitely has more laughs than scares, Parker Posey is in the film for crying out loud!!! It laughs at itself!! Its like a Scooby Doo mystery. It also has a few parts that make you jump. Thats the beauty of it, this film doesn't fit snugly into a perfect little category. I mean, is Forrest Gump a comedy or a drama? Well, it certainly has both elements. One really must free their mind and accept that this film is not just a scary movie. Its a FUN movie!!I would also like to mention that a lot of people seem to think the film should have been different. For instance, I hear a lot of The movie should have had this happen or It would have been a lot scarier if this took place. Well, it didn't. The movie did its own thing, and its still making millions. You can find these same type of people quite often commenting on The Phantom Menace... Lucas should have done this. Well guess what? He doesn't care because its his movie. Remember? You just paid a few bucks to sit on your butt and watch it!!! Nothing can satisfy these people.In closing, Scream 3 will be enjoyable to anyone who's looking to have a good time! Everyone else, lighten up! Never be afraid to have fun!!!!

The recreation of ancient Rome is astonishingly beautiful and realistic.  And although the film indulges a bit too much in stylistic editing (hey fellas just stick the camera on a tripod so we can watch this amazing action), I must say the gladiator scenes are wonderfully paced, exciting and thrilling. After seeing Ben Hur a number of times on television, it's easy to walk into this picture with a few misconceptions.  Namely, a bunch of men in armor in chariot battles is about as lively as a tennis match.  Well, after seeing this picture, I wouldn't be surprised if someone had the audacity to revive Gladiator sports - chain mail, chariots and all.  The battle scenes in this film, simply rock.  And to top it off, the film has a great story, an identifiable hero and guess what - a female lead that isn't just scenery in a major pump-up-the-testosterone movie.  This is a must see.

The fight scenes were also good, the best since Braveheart(my favorite film).  A warning though; it is quite gory at times, so don't take the little ones.  The audience I saw it with really enjoyed it and so did I, so I recommend it to all of you.  Gladiator rules!!!

Linda Fiorentino did a wonderful job as the Last descendant of Christ, and Jay and Silent Bob (Mewes and Smith) were as funny as ever. I have read some of the other reviews and found that people either didn't see the humor in the film or found it offensive for the spoof on religion, but I on the other hand, found it brilliantly amusing with a solid plot and a vibrant cast of actors. Matt Damon and Ben Afleck play two fallen angels (Loki and Bartleby) who have found a loop hole to allow them to re-enter Heaven, Linda Fiorentino is chose to stop them. She is not alone in her quest. She has help from two self proclaimed prophets (Mewes and Smith) and the 13th Apostle (Chris Rock). Along the way they meet Serendipity (Salma Hayek) and together they must stop the angels, and rescue God (Alanis Morrisette) who has become trapped in a mortal body. The acting was quite entertaining, with the exception of Hayek who was mainly eye candy for the guys.The spoofing of religion was very well played and although the language was quite vulgar (ever second word began with F), some scenes may have been offensive, but the overall message gets through. If you look at the underlying message then you will truly see the humor in this flick. The Bible has never been so interesting. This movie is a well thought-out picture and my kudos go to Kevin Smith for making this thought provoking, yet still humorous in the traditional Smith style. This movie deserves more credit then it is getting. I quote Farris Bueller If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up, it is so choice! Go and rent this one, you will not be disappointed. I give this film a 9.5 out of 10. One of the most sinfully amusing and original films of the 90's. Go get it NOW!! You won't be sorry.

His brother Llyr appears with him here, the lesser-experienced brother that had previously only appeared in Ymadawiad Arthur and has made no further films to date. He does adequately, yet watching this - Rhys' second cinema film - it becomes clear he's the star.Off-puttingly touted as the Welsh Trainspotting - because who wants imitations? - this is really nothing of the sort, and is far more impressive than you would expect. Already three years old, it has yet to be shown on British terrestrial television and nor do I expect it ever will be. It's content is morally vacuous, including police corruption, joyriding, drug taking, animal killings and murder. Peppering the script are a man who breaks his wife's nose, massage parlour brothels, female masturbation and almost continuous usage of the f-word.If that hasn't already put you off, this is a tale that features two bath-sharing brothers, who, after being refused compensation for their father's broken leg, take revenge by urinating on their enemy's daughter. However, Twin Town, bizarrely, never really offends, as it is done in, despite the subject matter, a good-natured tone. And I did have to smile at the real-life names of the dogs that feature in this tale of cocaine dealers - Charlie and Snowy. I wonder if that was intentional?What really grips about Twin Town is that, in the age of the depleted UK film industry, it lacks the desperate mugging and dead laugh areas that characterise the 1990s British comedy. A desperate, please love us America, please give us your box office, we're begging, which is normally prevalent in the genre, is almost wholly absent here. (For further information on such a desperate breed, see Rhys' first major film Notting Hill) Okay, there is the overstatement that sees a male voice choir singing Mungo Jerry's In The Summertime, or the twins joyriding their own father's hearse, but generally this film, despite the extremities of it's plot, does keep an eye towards realism and naturalistic dialogue. And the overlong, feeble comic pauses that normally kill off the rotting carcasses of British Film are nowhere to be found, due to a constantly moving, frenetic pace.The only down side to all this is that, apart from Rhys who has appeared in, to date, ten movies after this, the rest of the crew involved haven't achieved success. In fact, this was the first feature of the two writers involved and they haven't written another film since, presumably due to its lacklustre showing at the box office.

My advice Just go in with the anticipation that this will be a delightful experience and a real treat.Love's Labour's Lost is definitely the most refreshing movie that has been made in ages. It just soothes with charm and brings out the child in you. It has scenes that normal adults would almost be embarrassed to enjoy which forces out one's inner child to make you truly relax, be yourself and have fun. I refer mostly to the dancing and singing but also some tremendously hilarious scenes with the Spaniard Don Armando. Another highlight was Geraldine McEwan who played her small role as Holofernia perfectly! She was such a delight it was almost disappointing that she didn't have a bigger role. Everyone was perfectly cast from the Princess down to Dull the bobby (okay, I had my second thoughts about the Princess played by Alicia Silverstone, but I got over it and think she pulled the role of quite marvelously).As everyone knows by now it was shot in the style of the classic musicals of the '30s and '40s. Even the opening credits are done EXACTLY like a film from that time (with a silky background and headshots of all the actors with their roles, much like Wizard of Oz - it even goes through the ENTIRE credits in the beginning - something unheard of in today's society). It's Much Ado About Nothing meets Singin' in the Rain (Really!). The songs all fit in so well it almost looks like they were written for this film.When the first number started there was this big build-up (with the music) and then suddenly the four buddies stopped everything and switched into their dancing mode.

Now, this isn't a movie for EVERYONE, but, if you're someone who is looking for a new experience and a movie that plays with your mind, see this.  You will leave this movie saying to yourself ..what....geeze.....

I rented it after watching Joseph last month (I taped it 5 years ago off TNT) and looked for what other movies Paul Mercurio made.  I liked it so well, I played it for my 12, 11 and 8 yr old nieces when they spent the night. They all loved it and wanted to buy a copy.  I was fortunate enough to win an auction on-line for a new copy. Can't wait to get it, as it is not available for sale in US, my nieces can't wait either.

The film is sacreligious, yet, I found it funny. I view it as a spoof on a style of films that has sort of went out of style. This film is the Pythons answer to THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD etc.. let's face it, only they could get away with making something like this, and they did. I think when the Pythons did this film people realized that they mock everything, so religious conservatives were not offended. I know I wasn't. The film wasn't a slam on christianity, I think it was a slam on Cecile B. Demille extravaganzas. There is some clever stuff in this, I mean some really clever stuff. The example I'll use is the scene where the Three wise Men show up at the wrong manger after following the star. I won't ruin it for those of you who have not seen it. If you haven't....well give it a shot.

The book was filled to the edges with symbolism, depth, and serious points to be made. The film showed the events that happened in the book, not the points. It only show the major events at that. R.P. McMurphy was a young fighter with large flaming red sideburns, swelling arms with huge tatoo's. The movies Mac was a tired looking Jack Nicholson. The narrator, Chief Bromden was a minor character whose past and mind was neglected. Big Nurse, Nurse Ratched did not have the Combine. There was a Chinese author whose name slips me now; He was an anarchist (that has nothing to do with him. Anyways...)who wrote about communism and how it should tumble and fall. His book was turned into a film. When this happened, the film was pro communism and the plot fought dissidents who were against it. I think the same thing happened here. The book was so well thought out, that everything had 3 meanings, every paragraph could be turned into an essay and every thing about it was zenevery place had it's thing and everything was in it's place. Example Randle Patrick McMurphy-R.P.M.(fast, energetic)-Revolutions per minute (constantly fighting the combine) and Kesey picked the three names of R.P. McMurphy because they stand for something like, young, rebel, natural born fighter. Read the book, it'll do you good.

I thought Street Fighter and Super Mario Bros. were not only entertaining, but funny as well. But one thing they didn't have was particularly good special effects or acting. When Mortal Kombat came out, I just had to see it. I just loved it. It is one of my favorite movies of all time! I think that the acting and special effects, while not perfect, are extremely good. I especially like Johnny Cage, since he's really cool, and funny too. Overall, the fight scenes are entertaining and nicely laid out (especially Cage vs. Scorpion!) but they are a little too short. This is a movie that has something in it for action fans from 10-60. But this movie is only for action fans. And while people who aren't familiar with Mortal Kombat may enjoy it, it's better if your a fan of the games.
