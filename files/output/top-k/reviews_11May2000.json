[{"date":"11 May 2000","score":"","review":"  Election is a superb satire not just of high school teen lives, but also the lives of the teachers.  We all know, or have met people like Traci Flick(Reese Witherspoon), and they are defitinely annoying.  Matthew Broderick is excellent as the high school teacher who tries to toss a stumbling block in front of Traci to keep her from succeeding at her goal of becoming the senior class president.  An excellent character driven movie. The voice over thoughts of the characters was dead-on funny!  Kudos to the writers!  The part where Traci is thinking about what life is like for teachers while looking at Mr. McAlister, wearing the same boring clothes and saying the same thing year after year while the students go on to successful profitable careers, was definitely funny and biting.  Thank goodness for video and cable because they give overlooked gems like Election a second chance to find an audience.  8\/10 stars.
