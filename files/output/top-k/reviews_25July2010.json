Cannibalism in films is often hard to find as it is in the real world these days. And although this film could have been truly terrifying if played straight, the black comedic style also serves it well in parts. Ravenous is a story dealing with cannibalism, and its effects on those who practice it. If the legends we hear in this film are indeed true, then we'd probably see a lot more of it. The setting of the story is also a nice change from the norm in most horror movies. Most of the action is played out in the wilderness near a tiny army outpost in California during the 1840s. Considering a true story of cannibalism did play out in this geographical area once, that makes this story all the more eerie.Guy Pearce plays an army officer recently decorated for valor during the Mexican-American War. We know right off the bat that he was in fact a coward who just happened to stumble into circumstances that allowed him to capture an enemy unit. It isn't clear just how, but soon his superior officers find out he's a fraud and ship him out to tiny Fort Spencer located in high up in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Through flashbacks, we learn that Pearce had acted as a coward during battle and played dead. His body was stacked into a cart with other American dead and taken back to the Mexican fort. Pearce ingests blood from his dead comrades, and then becomes brave and invincible. Soon, he captures the enemy position all by himself. But this deed actually winds up getting him exiled to the tiny fort populated with some truly odd characters. And things are just getting started. Shortly after his arrival, a drifter claiming to be from a doomed wagon train shows up telling wild tales of cannibalism and hinting that some members of the party may still be in danger. Its obvious to us that this drifter is not telling us the whole truth. But yes, he is a cannibal and soon he is urging Pearce to join him at the buffet table! Much of the cast either becomes food or becomes a cannibal as the action plays out in some truly grotesque ways.The film is often too silly for its own good, but there are some very memorable moments. Robert Carlyle as the mysterious drifter walks away with this film, literally chewing the actors and scenery to bits. The soundtrack is oddly unique, just like most of the picture. The cast is full of quirky character actors like David Arquette, Jeffrey Jones, and Jeremy Davies. The mountain scenery is very beautiful as this was filmed in eastern Europe. It was a nice touch casting a vegetarian like Pearce as a man who has to eat human flesh on three occasions in order to survive in this film. This film is a decent effort and a nice gory diversion from your standard run of the mill torture based horror film which are all too common these days. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.

My one and only connection to it the grunge. As a huge grunge fan (especially of Pearl Jam) I've had since years ago a sort of pending meeting with Crowe's second feature. Today I finally sat down I watched it on DVD. I have to say, if you want something more related to music, something like, I'm pretty much guessing as I have seen only parts of it (the Tiny Dancer part for sure), Crowe's ALMOST FAMOUS, or something that really puts you in the grunge scene, you'll disappointed. To be fair, it made think in that music-related talk with Quentin Tarantino from the Collector's Edition of the PULP FICTION Soundtrack. And that is because Tarantino says this what I don't wanna do is, and I've see it happen in a lot of movies, where they just turn up the soundtrack to create a false energy, or in particularly to create a sense of period. They're not investing in the picture. OK, it's the sixties, we play a lot of sixties songs and that will create the period. To me that's cheap, like listening to the radio and watching a movie at the same time. They don't really go together. In this case, I wouldn't go as far as to call the use of some Pearl Jam songs, and the scenes of Alice In Chains and Soundgarden playing at some bar, cheap, but they definitely don't create something special, something that, like I said, really put us in early 90s Seattle. For instance, it's only people dancing in a club to a Pearl Jam song (always great to hear Pearl Jam though). And yes, maybe that's just early 90s Seattle, and yes I'm caring too much about the setting of the story but to be more fair, I wouldn't have seen a romantic comedy by Cameron Crowe if not for the grunge thing. I mean, something like Crowe's SAY ANYTHING&#x85; is not the kind of movie I'm always looking forward to check out. So, the level of disappointment that SINGLES gives to you may certainly vary. I mean, you can enter here not knowing anything about the grunge setting, or you can enter here seeking for a movie about early 90s Seattle musicians (maybe thanks to the image of Matt Dillon with the grunge look and his guitar). In my case, and like I said, it did disappointed me in the setting thing but in the end I really can't say this is something anybody should runaway from, that anybody should avoid at all costs. It's a pretty darn normal relationships movie, simply as that. It almost never feels false in that regard, which is certainly the best thing. My main point here is that pretty much this whole story doesn't go hand-to-hand with the period it is setting in. Sure, Matt Dillon's character Cliff has a grunge band (you just gotta like a whole lot this character! Now, a song like Touch Me, I'm Dick is about... what?; Cliff Well, I think Touch Me, I'm Dick, in essence speaks for itself. I think that, you know, that's basically what the song is, um... about... is about, you know... I think a lot of people might think it's actually about, you know, My name is Dick, and, you know, you can touch me, but, I think, you know, it can be seen either way) and the other main characters (played by Campbell Scott, Kyra Sedgwick, Bridget Fonda, Sheila Kelley and Jim True-Frost &#x96;nice to see Prez from The Wire&#x96;; the acting is fine) go out to bars to listen to Alice in Chains (there's a scene with main character Steve, and Sedgwick's character Linda, and his record collection, Hendrix, the Clash, you know), to dance to State of Love and Trust, but are they really Generation X characters? Well, the main couple in the movie, Steve and Linda, ain't. Like I said, it is an ordinary relationships movie, that is entertaining and that probably you can enjoy more than me. If I will remember SINGLES for something is definitely for its great cameos Eddie Vedder, Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament (is just fun with these guys! They play the band mates of Cliff's band. Eddie is the drummer of the band, by the way), Chris Cornell (totally great, hilarious! Sort of reminded me Jay and Silent Bob from CLERKS an other Kevin Smith movies I have yet to see) and Tim Burton (as a video maker who is only like the next Martin Scorsese!). So, memorable details in an entertaining if totally ordinary love story&#x85; that would be my summary of SINGLES. Oh, and the soundtrack is certainly great, but some of the background music during the film is not (think of the opening theme of Friends and you'll get the idea. When I thought this I didn't know that this movie became sort of the basis for Friends, if wikipedia doesn't lie Warner Bros Television tried immediately to turn Singles into a television series. When Crowe balked at the notion, the company proceeded with the idea, engaged a new writing and directing team, changing elements and the name to Friends).

I am afraid that though I liked many of the components of the film, the film as a whole was somewhat disappointing. Perhaps I just don't get all that Don Coscarelli is trying to do or perhaps Coscarelli doesn't understand what is the eventual end to such an openly ambiguous story. Some reviewers seemed to really get a lot out of the vague ending, but the fact is this and quite clear - no one can say for sure what happens and give substantial evidence to support it. That's fine. I like a film that tries and make one think, but sometimes that veneer can only mask shortcomings of a film and director and script as well. I believe Phantasm IV falls into both of those categories. The story picks up right where Phantasm III ends and Reggie is spared for a truly ridiculous reason(as later he is targeted whilst nothing substantially has happened in the plot). Michael takes roots in the desert to await his showdown with the Tall Man after trying to commit suicide. He then enters a time portal to the beginnings of the Tall Man in the Civil war era as a doctor. I found this line of storytelling interesting, but it never really explained much to me. I had so many questions at the end of the film. There are some truly horrific scenes like the one where Reggie deals with a super highway patrolman. Reggie and a beautiful girl entwined in some ridiculous plot twists. Scads of flashbacks from the over-shot first Phantasm film incorporated into this film to try and make sense out of the story and perhaps contribute to some continuum of time story. Coscarelli as always has an eye for settings and creates bleak, depressing places with the best. The action scenes are taut and tense. Reggie Bannister, A. Michael Baldwin, and Bill Thornbury as Mike and Jody are back, and Angus Scrimm steals every scene he is in once again - and this time around actually gets to flex some acting muscle. I wish I got out of this what others have but really hope that a fifth installment comes while Scrimm is still with us. Without him, this series would have floundered some time ago.

Some reviewers seemed to really get a lot out of the vague ending, but the fact is this and quite clear - no one can say for sure what happens and give substantial evidence to support it. That's fine. I like a film that tries and make one think, but sometimes that veneer can only mask shortcomings of a film and director and script as well. I believe Phantasm IV falls into both of those categories. The story picks up right where Phantasm III ends and Reggie is spared for a truly ridiculous reason(as later he is targeted whilst nothing substantially has happened in the plot). Michael takes roots in the desert to await his showdown with the Tall Man after trying to commit suicide. He then enters a time portal to the beginnings of the Tall Man in the Civil war era as a doctor. I found this line of storytelling interesting, but it never really explained much to me. I had so many questions at the end of the film. There are some truly horrific scenes like the one where Reggie deals with a super highway patrolman. Reggie and a beautiful girl entwined in some ridiculous plot twists. Scads of flashbacks from the over-shot first Phantasm film incorporated into this film to try and make sense out of the story and perhaps contribute to some continuum of time story. Coscarelli as always has an eye for settings and creates bleak, depressing places with the best. The action scenes are taut and tense. Reggie Bannister, A.

Although Hansberry's childhood was a great deal more middle class than that of the Younger family who is the subject of the play, she captures the black urban experience of the civil rights era brilliantly. Some of the things written in A Raisin In The Sun were experienced by Hansberry personally, most particularly her own family's struggle to move into the white suburbs.Columbia Pictures had the good sense to hire Lorraine Hansberry to write the screenplay and convert her play which all takes place in the Younger family apartment in the south side of Chicago for the screen. There are a few brief scenes added outside the apartment. But what really holds the interest is the dialog between the four main characters in the apartment. It's a lot like Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night with souls laid bare. The apartment itself almost becomes a character, a home but also the symbol of a kind of prison the Youngers want to break out of.The four main characters are Walter Younger, Jr., his wife Ruth, his sister Berneatha, and mother Lena, played by Sidney Poitier, Ruby Dee, Diana Sands, and Claudia McNeil respectively who all came over from Broadway. Through McNeil's performance particularly, but the others as well, the family patriarch Walter Younger also comes alive. What has happened is that he has recently died and the family is awaiting a $10,000.00 insurance check, courtesy of his years of service with the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first primarily black union to organize in the USA. Poitier is working as a chauffeur, both Dee and McNeil work and have worked as domestics, Sands is a young college student with the ideas of her time, but she's also been spoiled a whole lot. Each has their own idea of what to do with the insurance money. The conflict and what eventually does happen divides and then unites the family in the end.A Raisin In The Sun ran for 530 performances on Broadway during the 1959-60 season and earned a flock of Tony Award nominations including Best Actor for Poitier and Best Actress for McNeil. Coming out as it did during the Civil Rights era it was as timely a literary masterpiece as there ever was. When it concluded its Broadway run, film production with just about the entire cast from Broadway commenced.A couple of other players who would make their marks later on were in A Raisin In The Sun.

But she's far more interested in Ivan Dixon who is from Nigeria way before he joined the cast of Hogan's Heroes.

First commercially by failing to recover its budget for it debuted in theatres together with one of cinema's greatest watershed events; Pulp Fiction. And then at Academy Awards where it was nominated for seven Oscars yet failed to win any, thanks to the sweeping show by the critics' darling, Forrest Gump.But life ever since has been very kind to this film, and both critics & viewers have embraced its uplifting story of hope & friendship with remarkable amount of respect, love & kindness. Today, The Shawshank Redemption enjoys a position that's arguably even higher than the two classics which eclipsed it back in 1994 and while it was discarded at its time of release, it is now rightly & universally acknowledged as one of the greatest films of all time.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife & her illicit lover and is ultimately sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison where his coping with the brutal hardships of confined life slowly earns him the respect of his fellow inmates & prison staff, including that of Red in whom Andy finds a trusted ally. The remainder of the film explores their friendship over the next two decades.Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption that'll manage to connect deeply with most of us in one way or another plus it also marks Darabont's directional debut and he couldn't have asked for a better start. All this film has is men in either prison or police uniforms talking to one another over the course of its runtime and yet it never looked dull or felt like dragging at any given moment.Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison and provides considerable depth & realism to the era this film is set in. Every moment of despair has a shadowy appearance while moments of hope gleam with light. Editing is spectacular too as the gradual progression of Andy's life, his friendship with Red, and his determination to not give in to the four walls containing him is effectively unfolded. And Thomas Newman's score beautifully blends with the film's tone & characters' lives, and is emotionally fulfilling.Coming to the performances, Tim Robbins delivers a swashbuckling performance as Andy Dufresne, the banker wrongfully convicted for the crime he didn't commit. And if Robbins is at his best, then Morgan Freeman is even better as Red, Andy's friend who is also serving a life sentence & is notorious amongst the inmates for he can smuggle goods into the prison. Freeman also narrates the story to us at which he does an even better job. His work is grounded & can go easily unnoticed, but the character of Red is the soul of this story.There is a reason why this film still connects with so many people & why many of them have latched on to it. There is a reason why even after two decades, its legacy keeps flourishing & viewers keep returning to it despite its low entertainment value. One major reason is that even though The Shawshank Redemption is a prison drama, its story of imprisonment goes far beyond the bricks & steel rods of a jailhouse. The entire picture is a reflection of our own imprisonment in the institutions of our daily lives; institutions like work, family, society etc & living up to the expectations of each one of them.On an overall scale, The Shawshank Redemption stresses that based on the outlook of life, there are only two types of people one who can be free even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned even in freedom. The message it is trying to resonate is clear Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free. And if we all give ourselves some hope, there is nothing we can't survive. Yes, it all seems preachy n everything, but then if there's ever been a motion picture that has earned this sort of right, it's The Shawshank Redemption. Strongly recommended.

The sequel's definitely inferior, and they literally just made up new rules or new scenarios to fit the screenplay that had to take all but 15 minutes, which included a 10 minute break, to write, but it's recommended for ONLY die-hard Pinhead fans.

The same word showing up in the main and subtitle should never be done once (Hellbound Hellraiser II,) but twice? (Hellraiser III Hell on Earth) What's next? Hellraiser Hell in a Handbasket? All Hell Breaks Loose Hellraiser? Or just Ah, Hell, Another Hellraiser? (Actually, there'll be more in the future of the series Hellseeker and Hellworld. I don't think those were as clever as mine.) While they're at it, they should pick up a better screenplay writer. Or reboot the series, despite a lot of people's distaste for reboots\/remakes. Hellraiser III Hell on Earth, though not a horrible movie, would've been best served shelved and then rebooted two decades later.In the same lines of other 1980s and early 1990s horror franchise sequels, comes Pinhead's third outing in which now the box is bestowed upon a TV reporter, Joey (Farrell,) in the Big Apple who must trick Pinhead &#x96; for some demon, sorry, Cenobite, he's pretty naïve &#x96; in the ghost world of Pinhead's alter-ego Captain Spencer so Pinhead can be defeated&#x85;ONCE AND FOR ALL! Seriously, they were making this up as they went along. But there's a little more to the thin story. Joey's trying to make it big in the news, so she's trying to crack a story after witnessing a exploding victim of the puzzle box everyone in the Horror Movie world should avoid, much like saying Candyman 5x in the mirror or going into the water&#x85;when they tell you there's a shark or piranha in there.Meanwhile, Pinhead's pinned to a post and copying from the movie's two predecessors, he needs someone to bring him blood so he can escape. No problem &#x96; these Hellraiser movies are chalk full of fools.

The movie portrays its era well, showing the near panic reaction to Russia's launch of Sputnik, as well as other period events. The visuals are great.The performances, especially those of the several members of the seven the movie chooses to to concentrate on, are also spot on. Ed Harris is terrific as John Glenn, Scott Glenn does justice to Alan Shepherd, Fred Ward portrays Gus Grissom dramatically well, and Dennis Quaid provides an easily likable Gordon Cooper. All of the actresses in the roles of the astronaut's wives do a terrific job as well.The story is told fairly chronologically, and even though we know what is going to happen, an adequate amount of suspense is served up. This movie is a good and wholesome primer for any youngster interested in the history of the space program, departing from actual history only enough to maintain dramatic cohesion.I have given only nine stars due to what I feel is the unnecessary inclusion of the story of aviation pioneer Chuck Yeager. With all due respect to Yeager, his story is such that it deserves its own movie and really has no place here. Nor does the rather silly scene of the Australian Aborigines during the Glenn spaceflight. Removal of these instances of padding would have perhaps rendered a shorter and tighter telling of the real story here space exploration.Those issues aside, the Right Stuff is a truly enjoyable experience and worth watching for everyone.

Everybody nods knowingly and they may have correctly judged my motivation in watching it. However, nothing prepared me for the way I felt after watching it and still feel about it now. I won't go into the story or spoilers, because they are sufficiently documented elsewhere here. On the face of it, there's an opportunity to make a genuinely erotic movie. What I saw was a movie about three girls who have, in some way or another, been rejected pushed aside or pressured into making choices which aren't their own. They are growing up and finding their way, not fully understanding the consequences of their own emotions. Those parts which I might have found erotic I found, instead, very tender and beautifully moving. The scene where Tori explains to Paulie that she will never love anyone the way she loves her is the most heart breaking piece of cinema I have ever seen. I get emotional just thinking about it! Piper Perabo gives an astoundingly real and powerful performance as a girl rejected first by her natural mother, then by her adoptive parents and,finally, by the girl she loves. Jessica Pare is convincing as a spoilt girl who sees herself losing all the benefits her family provide if she proves to be in any way less than the trophy daughter they imagine. She is plainly in love with Paulie but fails to see the consequences of her rejection until it's too late. Mischa Barton is also convincing as a young girl confused by her new surroundings but loyal to those who show her friendship. Her dismay when her father fails to arrive for a school event was profoundly touching. In the end,though, it's Piper Perabo who truly stands out. Why was she not nominated for any major award for this? I'd feel pretty aggrieved if I were her! I would have given 10\/10 but for the ending. I felt a movie this good deserved something more conclusive and credible. Over all,though,it's not soft porn, not comically erotic, and nothing to watch with friends over beer. It's a beautiful, profoundly affecting film about true love and teenage girls. Anyone who dreads the day when their daughter comes home and says 'Dad, I have something to tell you...' really must watch this. I promise you, it could change your life!
