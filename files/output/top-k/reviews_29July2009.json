[{"date":"29 July 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Ravenous is a killer movie.Apparently there's a Native American legend that if a man consumes the flesh of another man, he inherits his strength\/life-force.That's the premise of this movie.The antagonist (Robert Carlyle) is disturbing and intense through the first half of the film. He pants like a dog, chases his victims on foot through the frontier. He absorbs bullets as if they were scratches. As long as he eats, he is unstoppable. He becomes very tame and civil during the later half of the movie, which adds to the uneasy feeling of the movie. He explains his moral disregard for human beings, and his lust for power through cannibalism.Great bad guy. He really makes the movie.The music is strange... it sounds like really cheesy simple banjo-synth. It really threw me off in the beginning of the movie. This song gets more and more layered as the scenes progress. By the end of the movie you get to hear the full song in all it's symphonic glory. It was hair-raising.There's stuff in this movie I haven't seen anywhere else. It's unique as heck and it needs a better user rating, in my opinion.
