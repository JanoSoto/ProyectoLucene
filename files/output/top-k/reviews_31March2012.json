One of them was Charles R Jackson's THE LOST WEEKEND, and by the time he arrived in Hollywood, Wilder had decided that the novel would be the basis for his next film.This is one of those productions that was jerky getting started. Cary Grant was offered the plum role of Don Birnam, but turned it down, as did Wilder's next choice, José Ferrer. The role was then offered to Paramount contract player Ray Milland, who had been working in films since 1929 and was a solid and dependable player who had not yet realized his potential as an actor. Milland at first refused to do it, partly because the role intimidated him and partly because studio advisers told him it would be the death of his career. But in the end he decided to do it, and it would prove to be his breakthrough role after more than two decades in Hollywood.Milland did his homework; to prepare for the role he spent a night in Bellevue Hospital as a patient, and stopped eating as much, which is something alcoholics often do. And so the film was made with Milland in the lead, Phillip Terry as his brother Wick, who vacillates between trying to help Don stop drinking and unwittingly enabling him, and Jane Wyman as his loyal girlfriend Helen St James.In the original novel, the thing that drove Don Birnam to drink was a homosexual affair; because of the production code, he was given a massive case of writer's block instead. It seems a weak reason to drink, but the hard-hitting screenplay by Charles Brackett and Wilder, and Wilder's sure-footed direction, plus an all-stops-pulled-out performance by Milland, make the whole thing not just convincing but terrifying.The film opens with the brothers packing for a weekend in the country, the object being to keep Don away from the bottle. Helen is there to see them off and to offer words of encouragement. But Don has other ideas; upon discovering that Helen has a pair of tickets to a concert, to which she was planning to go alone, he convinces Wick to take her on the grounds that he wants some alone time. What he does not tell Wick is that there is a bottle of whiskey hanging from a string out the window. Wick finds it quite by accident, and when Don protests he did not know it was there, pours it down the drain and leaves with Helen for the concert.As luck would have it, the cleaning lady shows up; Don tells her to go away and she asks about the money Wick was supposed to pay her. Turns out it is in the sugar bowl in the kitchen; he pockets it and tells the woman to come back on Monday. He then heads for the liquor store where he buys two quarts of cheap rye, and proceeds to his favorite bar to spend some of the change on shots. The bartender Nat (Howard Da Silva) doesn't like him, but as long as Birnam has money he pours for him.Thus begins a terrifying and intense odyssey into an alcoholic binge, complete with a stay in the drunk ward at Bellevue and a case of the DTs. In the hospital he encounters a male nurse named Bim Nolan (Frank Faylen), a vicious and rather obvious homosexual who seems to take delight in needling the patients he is supposed to care for.Don manages to escape from the hospital by stealing a doctor's coat when another patient has an attack of the DTs and has to be dragged out by force. But even his stay in the hospital was not rock bottom. This is a nightmare of a movie, and the hopeful ending seems just a little too pat. Also, it is interesting that a film dealing with alcoholism in 1945 does not at least mention Alcoholics Anonymous, which at the time had been in existence for ten years. Love of a good woman and a sense of purpose are probably not enough to keep an alcoholic sober, but this is a very minor quibble in what is otherwise a realistic, hard-hitting, and unforgettable film.Milland delivers the performance of his career in this one; it won him a well-deserved Oscar and elevated him to major star status, but while he was always solid and dependable and even showed occasional flair, he would never again plumb the depths of a character the way he does here.Wyman, Terry, and Da Silva supply excellent support, but at the end of the day this is very much Milland's film just Don Birnam and the bottle.

I wouldn't want it to be dubbed despicable or even loathsome, but I wouldn't want it to be labeled as the greatest motion picture ever made. With title comes untold expectations, and the problem with a title of this magnitude is it provides people the ability to make assumptions and expectations that a film simply can not live up to. I'm sure some have written off Orson Welles' Citizen Kane as boring, overrated, and stupid, when really, if looked at from a technical standpoint and many other common film field, it truly is a masterpiece on film.Again, the question people will inevitably ask me I will not answer. The question will be is it really the greatest film of all time? That question simply can not be answered. It's an objective question, and you'll never get an answer that isn't subjective. Poll everyone you know, it will still be subjective. I don't care if a million people label something the best, because it still doesn't represent fact. It makes it widespread opinion. Citizen Kane, I don't believe, is the greatest film I've ever seen (not that I could say what is), but it is one of the most intriguing and important films I have yet to see.The story revolves around Charles Foster Kane (Welles), who is based off of the real life newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst. The film opens with Kane laying in his bed, gripping a snow globe, as he utters the simple word Rosebud, and then the globe smashes seconds after he dies. Because of Kane's popularity, his death sparks mass attention, and reporter Jerry Thompson (Alland) is determined to decipher what his last word truly meant. The film winds up evolving into a nonlinear narrative, flashing back to when Kane was a boy, when he was growing up, and when he rose to fame.I can't see Kane being labeled the greatest film of all time for its plot. For a film of that title, you'd expect a twisty plot that goes in every conceivable direction, leaving you breathless and somewhat confused. Not Citizen Kane. The story is pretty simple and the progression rather speedy. But there I go again with that impossible expectation business.Where Kane really gets interesting is from a technical and intellectual standpoint. The film is the prime example of film noir, and the one cinephiles usually reference first. The use of light and shadow is very prominent in the film, and keep in mind, this was never done before. Some tracking shots are marvelous as they are complex and smooth. Everything seemed to be specifically planned out ahead of time, which is why the film doesn't feel rushed. Dialog was clearly perfected, shots were definitely practiced, and technique and stylistic intentions bleed through the storytelling. This makes Kane inevitably interesting and without a shadow of a doubt different. For the time at least.It is in this regard where people become massively disappointed. We have seen these same sort of tracking shots before, as well as having our perspective tricked, and light be the main focus in a film. It's nothing new. But for the time period this was revolutionary and riveting. It still is, personally. It is wholly consuming, incredibly enjoyable, and just all around fascinatingly complex.To add to the history lesson I'm reciting, the backstory on how this film came to be should award it some respect and recognition as well. Welles was big on the radio, airing the highly controversial War of the Worlds in 1933, and having major success in the field of theater. He signed a contract with RKO Pictures in 1939, where the studio gave him full control on a picture of his choice. He could write the script, choose the actors, and had privileges to edit the film to his own personal liking. This was such a rarity in a world dominated by studios. Newcomers were hardly given any room to maneuver, and when Welles had all of these privileges practically handed to him just because of minor past experiences, it really got people talking and what he delivered was beyond anyone's expectations. The film infuriated William Randolph Hearst so much that he threatened to have the film blacklisted and banned, which could partially be why the film received no Oscars other than Best Original Screenplay.Citizen Kane is a wonderful film that must be experienced. The history is one you can't ignore, the acting is superb, the storytelling, if a bit simple, is nonetheless engaging, the dialog is crisp, the music is lively and intelligent, and the filming and editing is nothing shy of entrancing and, literally, revolutionary. The moral also rings truer today than it probably did in 1941. Instead of feeling like you should enjoy it out of obligation, feel you should see it because of obligation.Starring Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore, Everett Sloane, Ray Collins, George Coulouris, Agnes Moorehead, Paul Stewart, Ruth Warrick, Erskine Sanford, and William Alland.

Directed by Orson Welles. ","genre":"Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"31 March 2012","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" On the Town (1949)There is so much going right with this movie--from the photography (yes) by Harold Rossen and the music (famously) by Leonard Bernstein, from the leading actors (Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly) to the directors (Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly)--it's hard to realize how dated or almost bad some moments have become. This is delightful, fantastic, and inspired stuff, total fun top to bottom. But it also has moments that are cringe inducing.And I like musicals.If you don't like musicals in particular, you should start with specimens with wider appeal, and higher standards Singin' in the Rain and West Side Story would work for me, if we're talking classics. Throw in Swing Time or Top Hat if you want an Astaire classic, too. Or a Garland singing musical.This one is from the amazing run of polished hits by producer Arthur Freed. The choreography varies from excellent to wonderful. If it's choreographed dancing you like, check this out. Some of the format it is from the standard style of the Golden Age, where the characters break into song or dance in the middle of their normal doings--in this case, three sailors racing through Manhattan on 24 hour leave.Other parts have choreography, probably by Gene Kelly, that becomes abstract and cinematic, a Hollywood innovation (also seen, famously, in Singin' in the Rain and An American in Paris). The scenes, whether stylized or realistic, are fabulous. The standards are high--space, light, and control of color (Technicolor, of course) inside and out.What drags the movie down is some awful writing, both in the dialog and even in some of the songs. I know lots of musical lovers who don't give a hoot if the lyrics make sense or are especially good--they become secondary to the rest of it, and the artifice is part of the game.

It was a trend-starter of a film, that didn't follow a blueprint, but accidentally formed one, that would become carbon-copied and mimicked like Jaws did for shark films. Then along came Raging Bull, a film by the almighty Scorsese. This marks the fifth film of his that I have awarded a perfect score, and the fifth film I've reviewed of his as well.Why do I idolize Scorsese? I find him to be a rare treasure in film. His ability to tackle any story, from a paranoid boxer, to the underground mobsters, to gambling tycoons, to the inter-workings of an Irish gang, to an amazing aviator-turned germaphobe, Scorsese can do it. And make it a work of incorruptible, undeniable art. He is often taken for granted, and not appreciated like he should be. Whether people like to admit it or not, he revolutionized cinema, and will continue to do it for many, many more years.Raging Bull was De Niro's plea to Scorsese to stop using cocaine, and to direct the film he wanted to for years. Scorsese has gone on record saying that De Niro practically saved his life, persuading, if not forcing, him to make the film. Scorsese has stated that Raging Bull was kamikaze style filmmaking, because originally, he never thought he'd make another film. That all changed when the film was met with acclaim from audiences and critics around the country, and three amazing talents, De Niro, Pesci, and Scorsese, were born.The film follows middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta (De Niro), a violent, insecure man who has become obsessed with not only the sport and art of boxing, but controlling everything in his life. He marries a young women named Vicky (Moriarty), and is coached and assisted greatly by his brother Joe (Pesci). Upon marrying Vicky is when Jake's real insecurity and paranoia unfolds. He is constantly fearing that Vicky is seeing other men behind his back. One day, she comments that the boxer Jake's about to fight is a young, limber, good-looking guy who might get the best of him. Before Jake can even consider the other two facts, he stops and lectures her and asks why she calls him good-looking. When it comes to fighting the guy, Jake assures he'll never be called good-looking by anyone for a long time.Main writer Paul Schrader, who also worked on other Scorsese films such as The Last Temptation of Christ and Taxi Driver, does a brilliant job of giving these characters, not only descriptions and stories, but long, healthy monologues that never become routine or laborious. My personal favorite scene is when both Jake and Joe are discussing personal matters while one is trying to fix the Television. The scene goes on for over four minutes, but the dialog is crisp and nothing shy of gripping. This scene is crucial to the plot because it shows Jake's insecurity consuming him and virtually eating him alive. Who can you trust when everyone looks like an enemy? The film is heavily stylistic as well, probably Scorsese's most to date. If anything should be praised, it's the experimental shots Scorsese uses. There are tracking shots that show depth and space, sometimes distorting it, like during the fight scenes, a delightful and rare coherency to the relentless and bloody combat sequences, that are gritty and brutally realistic, and the high contrast black and white further evokes depression and melancholy emotions to the film.This is a beautifully made film in every sense of the word. It's a deep, involving character study on a character we can't stand to look at sometimes. The third act focuses on where LaMotta's nervousness and insecurity got him in life; an ungrateful, cocky, intolerable, narcissistic brute that feels entitled to anything and everything. Yet again, this is a story from Scorsese about short lived glory. Where a man's inner demons and personal conflicts further bog him down to where he becomes unable to function normally. We've seen it before, but every time we do, it seems as if it is told in a richer, more complex way.With all this talk of style, emotion, characteristics, and backstory, let's not forget about another very important element; the rich performances. De Niro is superb, showing passion, charisma, and dedication - all the traits which have lead him to be called one of the greatest actors of all time. Pesci shows great control whenever he's on screen, also brewing his trademark animalistic behavior that has made him instantly recognizable and the subject of many peoples' praise. But let's not forget some side characters that have, over the years, gotten the cold shoulder. Frank Vincent, one of Scorsese's regulars, plays Sal, one of Joe's local connections with the mob in New York. Vincent has been in both Casino and Goodfellas as a supporting character and has never drummed up acclaim of his own. Here, he is spot on perfection, and somewhat underdeveloped and underutilized.Another performance that hasn't garnered enough fame is Cathy Moriarty as De Niro's wife. She is in a harsh position, like most women in Scorsese's films. She is strong, capable, and commendable in her efforts to break free of never-ending torment and fear caused by her husband.Raging Bull is absolutely extraordinary filmmaking, from a director that was hesitant about creating the film in the first place. I'm sure he never thought the film would amount to much, but it has already earned a spot on the National Film Registry, two Oscars, and a place on AFI's list of best films. I'd say it was a worthy gamble, and a lifesaver on Scorsese's part.Starring Robert De Niro, Cathy Moriarty, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent. Directed by Martin Scorsese.

Aside from false presentation of various real people, including Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), the film proceeds to solve the case with a solution that has been discredited for decades. Indeed, among serious ripperologists, there still is no consensus on who Jack the Ripper was. A recently published book lists no fewer than 27 possible suspects, the surnames of which include Druitt, Ostrog, Chapman, Cohen, Sickert, Gibson, Dodgson, Deeming, Thompson, and Williams.As a fictional whodunit, with suitable red herrings, the film offers a little more, but it still contains problems.

A year later, Michael returns to his home and stalks a group of college students who get to spend the night in his home for a reality show, Dangertainment created by Freddie (Rhymes) and Nora (Banks). Sara (Kajlich) is the main teen who's fearful of going into the Myers house and becomes targeted by Michael. Rick Rosenthal also returns as director after he directed the second film. This is a disappointing and unnecessary sequel and I think I speak for many that the beginning with Curtis is probably the only good part. Rhymes and Banks didn't help it either, but I like the camera stuff and probably still recommend it if you're a fan of the series.
