What do you expect when you see the film's synopsis, to be honest you expect a run of the mill Hollywood flick. Yet what you get is not such a thing, whilst the film definitely is a very Typical piece of Anerican film making, it does have a few interesting and different tricks up it's sleeve. I would say that it is an enjoyable picture, but it has sone very obvious and irritating flaws, although I'm able to suspend my disbelief for the duration of the film, it is not without some difficulty, which is somewhat surprising as there are many other films with far stranger plots that I find easier to be pulled into.Robert Carlyle, for me, is the best thing about this film. His acting is great, whatever scene he is in he manages to bring real life and energy to, which is something the lead seems to lack. The lead is obviously supposed to be a coward and a wimp, I am however unsure wheter the actor manages to pull this off. In many ways he seems subdued overly quiet and looks like a fish out of water, I am however inclined to think that this has nothing to do with his portrayal of the character, but more to do with his inabillity to act. My personal favourite scene is the fight on top of the mountain, where Carlyle reveals his true, if not somewhat obvious, colours. The scene is cleverly shot, making use of a wide range of interesting angles, I noticed a 'Vertigo' shot, the famous zoom in and tack back shot. The music is also fun and adds a lot to the pace of the film. Although at moments, it seemed to remind me of the Benny Hill music, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as I don't think the film was supposed to be taken entirely seriously.The films concept, cannibalism, has been used in so many films that it often becomes boring, and unexciting. I have seen a lot of films where the fact that Humans eat other Humans is supposed to be scary, that usually when people try to do it, it becomes a snooze fest. However with Ravenous, I think that they have managed to change the basic idea of cannibalism about a bit, so that there is a at least an interesting plot playing out on screen, and not just humans eating. Whilst definitely not the greatest film I have seen, it is a long way from being the worse. Like I say it is an enjoyable film, it doesn't get too bogged down, and it moves forward at a good pace. It does have numerous flaws, like being shot in a blue tone, which I could really see little or no reason for. Overall I would say a solidly average film, it can never be more that that, but honestly I don't think it even wanted to be.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 May 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" OK so Ravenous.

Zoolander is one of the most wackest Ben Stiller comedies I have ever seen! In this movie Ben Stiller plays a male model named Derek Zoolander who has a big competition with another male model named Hansel (Owen Wilson). After Derek Zoolander lost the male model award at the VH1 Awards and then his three best friends die in a gas fight accident he decides to retire. The acting is annoying and Ben Stiller's voice is real annoying and unfunny.But after when Derek retires his boss Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller) offers him to join Jacobin Mugatu (Will Ferrell) agency. So when Derek joins Mugatu's campaign he gets brainwashed after being in a day spa and getting brainwashed to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia! By brainwashing Zoolander, Mugatu and his evil associate Katinka (Milla Jovovich) create a dumb and willing killer to do the job. Only in Time Magazine journalist Matilda (Christine Taylor) suspicion arises slowly, and she tries to stop Derek.Later in the movie Derek and Hansel start having a friendship between each other. There were many weird parts but one that I liked was when they were showing Derek at the day spa and he was listening to relax and they were showing this crazy video at the same time! I thought this movie was unfunny and could have been much better done.
