I think that they meant for this to be a shocker. The younger crowd should really just ignore this review because you probably have a very different basis for gauging this film.Here's what the film is about it's a cabin-in-the-woods remake\/ripoff of the old B&W original of Night of the Living Dead with an additional caveat... the producers tossed in every possible type of monster, moving pieces of monsters, evil spirits, demons, Texas Chainsaw Massacre Guys, and so on. The action is akin to that found in the second half of From Dusk 'till Dawn, (a film that I liked a lot!) The sound track is little more than a generic sound effects recording played in reverse, at various speeds, manipulated with digital delay. I think I might also have heard a variation of backwards Revolution No. 9 in there at one point. All in all, not terrifically innovative.The story A guy and his gal travel to this evil cabin and, as the legitimate residents aren't there, they help themselves to the place. She gets taken over right away by the evil spirits from the so-called Book of the Dead (he should NOT have played back that tape recording!!!) and the guy ALMOST falls to the same fate but he continues to drive the critters out of his system.Sometimes he outruns them in his big 4-door GM automobile, sometimes he outruns them on foot, and finally, the sun at dawn nixes them for the day. But the bridge is out and he cannot escape this rotten spot on the planet.The daughter of the legal residents and her husband come along a bit later and attempt to visit her parents at the cabin but, again, the bridge to get there has been utterly destroyed by some of the creatures (only God knows which one DUNNIT!); however, a half-witted, local Hillbilly-type and his chickie agree to take them in via the secret back route for a few bucks. All travelers to the evil cabin soon regret THAT unfortunate trip! The reason that the movie makes little sense to older horror fans is because there's no for-certain safe spot from these multiple monsters (the cabin is somewhat safe, sometimes !?!), nor is there a standard means of killing them. Sometimes, the following are effective to nullify monsters double-barreled shotgun, sunlight, chainsaw, knife, bludgeon, etc. Sometimes, none of this works for crap.We finally learn (from the semi-good spirit of the original male resident) that our heroes have to read a certain passage from that dang Book of the Dead to rid themselves of all the monster-demon chaos, so I was at least glad to hear that there was finally one clear way to end this misery.So, the group battles on and on with no apparent plot on which any of them can ride. And is it a SPOILER to say that the main guy is suddenly sucked into a Time Tunnel near the end of the flick which lands him in the middle of a pack of Medieval knights who are being attacked by a Pterodactylish Demon-headed Gargoyle??? The Exorcist is scary. Hitchcock's Psycho is scary. Halloween is scary. This film is as scary as Exorcist, The Heretic, (Exorcist II) with Richard Burton.... but there is some decent head-mashing-type humor dribbled here and there.

She is sent away to be a governess to seven children, of the Von Trapp family. Their father, Captain Georg Von Trapp, is a widower and very harsh on his children, treating them like he would do to his naval army. When Maria arrives she changes this, and brings music and laughter into the household, but not even Maria can change all the events that are about to come...Many have grown up with this movie, and I am one of them. As a child I loved The Sound Of Music, and I still do. A timeless classic, The Sound Of Music can be watched again and again. It is a universal movie, and there is a squeaky clean plot. No sex, no drugs, and no violence. Perfect for family audiences.This was the second film I saw with Julie Andrews, and I loved her more in this movie than I have with any of her other films. This is my favourite role of hers. She was the perfect Maria - her smile, her kindness, her attitude and confidence, and her angelic and enchanting voice. She looked beautiful, and her chemistry with Christopher Plummer was indeed wonderful. He was a good Captain Von Trapp, though he started off a bit rocky in my opinion. But his performance greatly improved throughout and by the end I could not imagine anyone else in his role. The children, every single one of them, delivered fine performances. They had exceptional singing voices, considering their age, and kudos to their choreographer for their dance sequences, especially in Do-Re-Mi and So Long Farewell, which they were brilliant in.I strongly believe the popularity of The Sound Of Music is mainly to the outstanding musical score by Roger and Hammerstein, but there are more factors to consider. For example, the gorgeous scenery, the acting (Julie Andrews owns this film), the universal family appeal, or maybe even the values that the film embraces. They are so decent. The popularity factor could be due of any one of these, however I believe it was the music. Each song is so wonderfully crafted. I cannot choose a favourite out of the songs, but I have always had a soft spot for Do-Re-Mi. I never really liked the song Edelweiss as a child, but now when I listen to it, I love it. It is highly underrated. My Favourite Things is a great song, very catchy, and really exposes Andrews' beautiful singing voice. The Lonely Goatherd also did that, but this time with...brace yourselves...PUPPETS! I remember watching that song over and over again and giggling with my family at the puppets and the yodeling - a lovely memory. I also think Something Good, and I Have Confidence are nice songs, and the same goes for So Long Farewell, with the children. And I cannot forget the outstanding choreography and singing in Sixteen Going On Seventeen, Liesl and Rolf's chemistry in that song was cuter than a cocker spaniel. There are many subplots in The Sound Of Music, like the romance with Liesl and Rolf, the war and escaping, the Baroness's entry into the lives of the Von Trapps, the singing competition, Maria's trouble in the convent...but the main story would be of the family, and their story together.

The survival of a small town in the US at a time when big shopping malls are opening everywhere. These small towns are doomed to die sooner or later. Their only chance is to become suburban development projects and become the home of people working in the big city next door who want to live away from the hectic activity of the city and commute there every day. We are before this development in Endora. The second interest is the fate of a family in which there is a mentally disabled child. Here they have no opportunity to provide him with an education and some professional activity. So he is more or less attached to a member of his family and he is haunting if not even worse that brother of his, as well as the police and neighbors. It is never vicious but it is really bothering those who want to have peace and quiet. The place of mentally disabled people in our society is something difficult to envisage because they are necessarily a burden to normative people and a normative system that has to adapt to them and not the reverse. Today things have changed a lot, thanks to such films probably, definitely. Then the film attaches itself to showing the mother who is an extremely obese person, her shame, her humiliation, her lot that is close to an ordeal. The film shows how dependent she is on her own family, on her own children, the father having died a long time before. And the film tries to show her under the best light they can afford.

The film though has a strange ending. The children decide to burn her in the house since she cannot be taken down. A domestic pyre for the mother and a complete liberation for the children who are scattered away now they are homeless. The burial of old civilizations, of the Hinduist tradition. Amazing. And yet it is not the end. A last scene shows how the elder brother is recuperated by his girlfriend who comes back to pick him up and away from Endora and by picking one she gets two because the disabled brother comes along too.

We are before this development in Endora. The second interest is the fate of a family in which there is a mentally disabled child. Here they have no opportunity to provide him with an education and some professional activity. So he is more or less attached to a member of his family and he is haunting if not even worse that brother of his, as well as the police and neighbors. It is never vicious but it is really bothering those who want to have peace and quiet. The place of mentally disabled people in our society is something difficult to envisage because they are necessarily a burden to normative people and a normative system that has to adapt to them and not the reverse. Today things have changed a lot, thanks to such films probably, definitely. Then the film attaches itself to showing the mother who is an extremely obese person, her shame, her humiliation, her lot that is close to an ordeal. The film shows how dependent she is on her own family, on her own children, the father having died a long time before. And the film tries to show her under the best light they can afford. On her disabled son's birthday, after having accepted to be introduced to her elder son's girl friend (a young woman who had to stop in Endora with her mother and their traveling bus for a couple of weeks because of the breakdown of the car they travel in), after climbing back up to the second floor bedroom of the house for the first time in many years and lying there on her back, she dies without any kind of pain or noise with her disabled son calling for her to wake up. The film though has a strange ending. The children decide to burn her in the house since she cannot be taken down. A domestic pyre for the mother and a complete liberation for the children who are scattered away now they are homeless. The burial of old civilizations, of the Hinduist tradition. Amazing. And yet it is not the end. A last scene shows how the elder brother is recuperated by his girlfriend who comes back to pick him up and away from Endora and by picking one she gets two because the disabled brother comes along too. That's what happens when a mechanical incident forces you to stop over in a lost village in the countryside for a couple of weeks. You get trapped in some kind of sentimental cage like the disabled brother's crickets in his glass jar where he raises them. A good decent softly entertaining film.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"27 January 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Thinner is just one of those movies that I always enjoy watching when its on. It's basically a great way to spend 90 minutes.I think the foremost reason why this is such a watchable movie is thanks to its wonderful concept. Its highly original and you just can't go really wrong with it. The story nevertheless is quite silly in parts, which is I think also mainly because there are some difficulties with the book translation to the screen. What works in a book just doesn't always work for a movie. Another problem with movies based on books is that a book has a beginning and an end, with in between a couple of hundred pages to lay out the story and characters and everything that happens in between. You then next have to try to put this all in an under 2 hour movie, without loosing the core and essence of the story. This most of the time has as a result that some things get rushed in the movie to get from point A to B.The actual ending is just great but there are also still some problems with it. Problem with the ending is that it's totally unclear why the main character is suddenly freaking out so bad and why he suddenly turns into psychotic murderer. Apparently a real returning theme in Stephen King novels; the main character going psycho toward the ending. He blames his wife for everything that has happened but this is totally unbelievable and unlikely this would ever happen. She at least most certainly did not deserved to die because of it. They try to 'justify' his killing of her even more by implying that she cheats on her husband with doctor Mikey. But again; now way that that justifies the thing happening to her in the end.No way the story would had still worked out as good if the make-up effects weren't as good. Robert John Burke goes from extremely fat at the start to extremely thin toward the ending, all with the help of make-up.The movie looks like a made for TV movie, which is obviously due to its restrained budget. So don't expect anything big or surprising camera movements and innovating directing or editing.The movie also doesn't have a too great cast but each actor serves its purpose and fits its role.

Its pluses are its noir New York camera work (sense of place and time) its somewhat offbeat narrative and original characterizations, and its economy (a lot on a shoestring). Where it does not cohere is in its effects, such as flashbacks, symbolic scenes, and symbols which may add to the flavor of the film, but not to its meanings. This in turn leads to problems with the ending and in on interpreting the movie on more than one level. In other words, if you dig too deep the film is less convincing.First, the problem with Gloria Price's past-- both the story and the images of her ballerina sister performing that accompanies it. We learn about the multiple tragedies that have shaped her young life--her mother's death at her birth, her father's close relationship to her successful older sister, her sister's suicide over her father's death, and Gloria's own ensuing abandonment (assumed) by the brother in law. Add in the extended performance that fills the screen for the story's duration. The meanings seem lucid enough but how do they enter the movie? Well we do learn why Gloria's alone, that her taking up work at Pleasureland as a partner dancer in what she calls a human zoo, is explainable, and that the lowly dance form isolates her even further from her sister and memories. But what about it? How does this central story exert itself on the film? Then there is the very drawn out fight among the warehouse mannequins. Very symbolic of something--those hundreds of nude dolls. That Rapallo uses an axe and repeatedly slices into these mannequins makes perfect sense since he has shown himself to be a sadist (tries twice to force sex on Gloria) and this reinforces his killer kiss identity. But how are we to interpret Davy Gordon's wielding some kind of spear and piercing torsos in a graphic way that clearly denotes rape? Davy does seem to see Gloria in a sexual way during the film (e.g. touching her drying lingerie as she sleeps), but this does not approach sadism, womanizing, or rape. In fact, for a boxer, Davy is remarkably reserved. But he does distrust her he says, I'm in over my head, and, of course, abandons her when she adopts female wiles to save her own life. But then this reading does not jive with an ending which certainly seems unquestioningly a happy one.(Let me add that the scene before the ending might make more sense in terms of Gloria's growing distrust of men---her father, her brother-in-law, her Boss, and now Davy's flight--but even this ending still does not explain Davy's piercing the mannequins.) Then we have the notes of perversity supplied by the harmonica dancers outside the dance hall on Broadway. Dance again and sexual innuendos again. Outside of adding a sense of underworld menace and city street arts, what do they contribute to the movie's undercurrents? Last--and least--there's the image of the horse ranch (perhaps a tribute to John Huston's great noir film The Asphalt Jungle) which surfaces in personal photos, phone calls, and a planned escape. Again this has surface motion, but it doesn't drive the film--the Sterling Hayden character in Jungle has a compelling need to break with the rackets and even refuses death so that he can realize a few moments in the pasture of his long dream. In this movie, Gloria is Davy's need, and one gets the impression they would do better in NYC than on his Uncle George's horse ranch.

Cronos utilises ideas behind ancient mythology and archaeology to create one of the more interesting MacGuffins ever put to film and that is a beetle-come-jewel that raises not only good excuses to include cringe worthy scenes of skin penetration but also ideas and theories on important issues such as reincarnation and everlasting life. Cronos has that atmosphere of dread running throughout it that you'd be hard pressed to find in a lot of other films; when you compare to what director del Toro has also done of what I've seen, you can see the resemblances in terms of look and genre when thinking of Pan's Labyrinth, Blade II and Hellboy even if Pan's Labyrinth is the only film that matches the quality and feeling Cronos achieves.The reason I mention Cronos feels like an update of the vampire film is that whilst the thought of vampires are sort of scary since they're uncanny creations of the mind, the sorts of films they're in never really scare you; just impress you with their mise-en-scene and atmosphere. Cronos does this and gets across its typical vampire conventions through character's lust for blood, daylight hatred and look of a monster who will eventually come back from the dead- it's main character even has to sleep in a coffin type box at one point. The film is a slow burner and a reasonably impressive one at that. It shows us the MacGuffin that is a bug-come\/jewel that houses a real bug that gets off over human blood by injecting itself into a human who touches it. del Toro draws us into looking at the first incident of the item in action; a nasty and suspense ridden scene as Jesus Gris (Luppi) holds it and it digs into him; there are later scenes that made me look away when he attaches it to some other places and it uses its tail in uncomfortable fashion.But this is good direction and writing; showing us piece by piece the item in action and developing the thing as if it were a character itself. It houses a real bug that has lived for centuries and it is a living thing after all so why not treat it like a character? Along with this, there is an early role for Ron Perlman as Angel de la Guardia who plays the nephew of an elderly man hell bent on getting this item since it is the source of not only his old age but his fixation; something that is played with by the dialogue when Angel is angry his uncle has lived so long and he must keep on serving him. There can be parallels made in regards to the film in numerous different ways first, the inclusion of religion is a strong, re-occurring element. The protagonists name is Jesus and he dies at one point before being resurrected similarly to the fable in the bible; secondly, Perlman's character is called Angel but any significance to an Angel's activity seems irrelevant here as the only Angel's in the bible either showed up to inform of pregnancy or guide certain people to a certain place. Angel in the film does neither of this and is more of a lackey for the bad-guy than anything else, even if he doesn't ever take a side per se.There is also the theme of reincarnation which is a strong Buddha belief. De la Guardia (Brook) goes on to say during the film that the insect may have been alive for hundreds of years; living off the unnaturalness that is the item; hibernating and surviving as the years pass. I've already said one character dies and comes back to life again as I expected he would and parallels could also be made with the notion of everlasting life and good health; something the third Indiana Jones film touched on with the Holy Grail; the idea in Cronos is that you do not drink from the correct cup but merely attach an item containing clockwork to your body and not only get a strange fix but get younger as the days pass whilst gaining a longer life. I always wondered what the holy water at the end of The Last Crusade would taste like and how the dynamics of wound healing would work but here, the idea that you have to go through pain and feel certain sensations in order to achieve eternal youth is given more of a thought and humanised a little more.It may sound like I enjoyed Cronos a little more than the rating I gave it but I suppose that's because there is a lot to read into, especially given the fact the director seems to have some things he wants to say and get across. I think this is del Toro's second best film behind Pan's Labyrinth because he goes relatively deep in themes and combines humour with skin crawling scenes that made me want to look away. The film is funny with its colloquial funeral director and his actions; its portrayal of Angel as a guy stuck in the middle on his own thanks to this youth brining MacGuffin that tangles everyone up and it also has a reasonable degree of sentiment. If you're looking for a funny yet smart foreign film that has its contemporary clash of humour, horror and deeper meaning then you cannot go too far wrong with Cronos.

I've already said one character dies and comes back to life again as I expected he would and parallels could also be made with the notion of everlasting life and good health; something the third Indiana Jones film touched on with the Holy Grail; the idea in Cronos is that you do not drink from the correct cup but merely attach an item containing clockwork to your body and not only get a strange fix but get younger as the days pass whilst gaining a longer life. I always wondered what the holy water at the end of The Last Crusade would taste like and how the dynamics of wound healing would work but here, the idea that you have to go through pain and feel certain sensations in order to achieve eternal youth is given more of a thought and humanised a little more.It may sound like I enjoyed Cronos a little more than the rating I gave it but I suppose that's because there is a lot to read into, especially given the fact the director seems to have some things he wants to say and get across. I think this is del Toro's second best film behind Pan's Labyrinth because he goes relatively deep in themes and combines humour with skin crawling scenes that made me want to look away. The film is funny with its colloquial funeral director and his actions; its portrayal of Angel as a guy stuck in the middle on his own thanks to this youth brining MacGuffin that tangles everyone up and it also has a reasonable degree of sentiment. If you're looking for a funny yet smart foreign film that has its contemporary clash of humour, horror and deeper meaning then you cannot go too far wrong with Cronos.

Cronos utilises ideas behind ancient mythology and archaeology to create one of the more interesting MacGuffins ever put to film and that is a beetle-come-jewel that raises not only good excuses to include cringe worthy scenes of skin penetration but also ideas and theories on important issues such as reincarnation and everlasting life. Cronos has that atmosphere of dread running throughout it that you'd be hard pressed to find in a lot of other films; when you compare to what director del Toro has also done of what I've seen, you can see the resemblances in terms of look and genre when thinking of Pan's Labyrinth, Blade II and Hellboy even if Pan's Labyrinth is the only film that matches the quality and feeling Cronos achieves.The reason I mention Cronos feels like an update of the vampire film is that whilst the thought of vampires are sort of scary since they're uncanny creations of the mind, the sorts of films they're in never really scare you; just impress you with their mise-en-scene and atmosphere. Cronos does this and gets across its typical vampire conventions through character's lust for blood, daylight hatred and look of a monster who will eventually come back from the dead- it's main character even has to sleep in a coffin type box at one point. The film is a slow burner and a reasonably impressive one at that. It shows us the MacGuffin that is a bug-come\/jewel that houses a real bug that gets off over human blood by injecting itself into a human who touches it. del Toro draws us into looking at the first incident of the item in action; a nasty and suspense ridden scene as Jesus Gris (Luppi) holds it and it digs into him; there are later scenes that made me look away when he attaches it to some other places and it uses its tail in uncomfortable fashion.But this is good direction and writing; showing us piece by piece the item in action and developing the thing as if it were a character itself. It houses a real bug that has lived for centuries and it is a living thing after all so why not treat it like a character? Along with this, there is an early role for Ron Perlman as Angel de la Guardia who plays the nephew of an elderly man hell bent on getting this item since it is the source of not only his old age but his fixation; something that is played with by the dialogue when Angel is angry his uncle has lived so long and he must keep on serving him. There can be parallels made in regards to the film in numerous different ways first, the inclusion of religion is a strong, re-occurring element. The protagonists name is Jesus and he dies at one point before being resurrected similarly to the fable in the bible; secondly, Perlman's character is called Angel but any significance to an Angel's activity seems irrelevant here as the only Angel's in the bible either showed up to inform of pregnancy or guide certain people to a certain place. Angel in the film does neither of this and is more of a lackey for the bad-guy than anything else, even if he doesn't ever take a side per se.There is also the theme of reincarnation which is a strong Buddha belief.

After renting it again recently I've changed my mind and now regard it as being one of the best in the series. It was a five day rental and I watched it three times in those five days, and returned it a day late so I could watch it a fourth time. The well written plot, an expanded hybrid between the subplot of the book 'Live and Let Die' (Felix being fed to the sharks) and the characters from 'The Hildebrand Rarity', has Bond quitting Her Majesty's Secret Service to track down those responsible for feeding Bond's ally Felix to the sharks and killing Felix's wife. Graphic and mean Bond movie, which in some ways follows the plot of the book 'Live and Let Die' closer than the film of the same title. Timothy Dalton nails the character perfectly moody, angry, he looks genuinely affected when he finds Felix and Della, after the tanker truck explosions at the end, and he seems to be beside himself when M revokes his licence to kill. Dalton very nearly perfected the cold, dark character Ian Fleming created in the novels and short stories, the same thing that Daniel Craig did in Casino Royale. Carry Lowell was very good also (great legs also) and Robert Davi was a great ruthless villain with no compunction about killing and torturing, but one who still honors and respects loyalty. But even after Sanchez knows Bond is after him, after Sanchez has Bond on the conveyor belt toward the saw blades, Bond still convinces him that Heller is double crossing him, using Sanchez's fear and uncertainty against him. The writers even managed to work Q into the script without having it being forced and feeling like needless comic relief, his character actually adds to the plot (noticably and happily, Q leaves his gadgets at the office, except for the silly ass laser shooting camera) This also has one of the best climaxes in the series, especially of the ones filmed in the 1980's.It's hurt only slightly by drab on location photography in the toilet called Florida and Mexico, and the opening wedding bit was too reminiscent of 'On Her Majety's Secret Service', but this is still one of the best and certainly most under rated Bonds in the entire series. It's unfortunate that after this film, the James Bond series was stuck in court and developmental hell for more than six years, after which Timothy Dalton resigned, which was probably the biggest setback this film series has ever seen.

Whichever way you turn, Fate sticks out a foot to trip you. Roberts, played by Tom Neal, is the whining, complaining protagonist in Detour, one of the worst, and best, pulp noirs you'll ever enjoy. And if Roberts doesn't have a good moment in any of the film's 67 minutes, you will if you get a kick out of pulp fiction so ripe it'll remind you of how old Charles Haskell's corpse is. Roberts, a piano player in a New York nightclub, was hitch hiking to L.A. to reunite with the woman he loves, his girlfriend Sue. When Haskell stops and gives him a ride, then dies of a heart attack, Roberts makes the first of many bad decisions. Haskell had several hundred in his wallet and three big, raw scratches on one hand. Wouldn't you know it, after ditching the body, taking the cash, the car and Haskell's identity, Roberts winds up stopping to pick up a hitchhiker...who turns out to be the dame who gave Haskell those scratches. Man, she looked like she'd just been thrown off the crummiest freight train in the world, Roberts says. We can see for ourselves. Vera (Ann Savage) is tough as nails. She's a tramp. She's poison. She knows Roberts isn't Haskell. She sets a hook in Roberts' mouth and pulls him around from one scheme to the next to get money. When Roberts finally resists...well, see the movie. How can a film be so bad yet be so satisfying? It was shot by Edgar Ulmer in only six days on a tiny budget and looks it. Ulmer probably paid more for all that rear screen projection than he did for the actors. Neal and Savage are barely even B-level quality. The movie is hardly more than an hour long. And yet... First, the movie moves quickly. There is absolutely no wasted time, even when Ulmer is padding out a few shots. Second, Tom Neal is perfectly cast. He has a petulant, greasy face and a plump, weak mouth. Neal was not a sympathetic or likable actor. In what career he had, which wasn't much, he usually was at his best whining or playing bullies. Here, he's just weak. His career was effectively over when he beat Franchot Tone nearly to a pulp over a bimbo actress named Barbara Payton. A few years later he married and then was accused of murdering his wife with a gunshot to the head. He spent several years in prison on a manslaughter conviction and died of a heart attack a few months after he was released. Not much to admire here. Ann Savage is so over the top as the tough Vera that we sometimes do a double take over how she handles her dialogue. Still, the two of them, perhaps inadvertently, do full justice to the concept of Detour as full-bodied pulp fiction. Third, the script is great. Pulp, when it works, is sleazy, dirty entertainment. That's Detour. Neal and Savage make this fatalistic pulp cartoon vivid, not by how skilled they are, but by how well they meet the conventions of pulp action. Fourth, let's hear it for Edgar Ulmer. Some of Ulmer's films -- Strange Illusion, The Strange Woman, for example -- are fun to watch but none of them, in my view, are worth spending too much time thinking about. Like Val Lewton, Ulmer was a man of limited talent who could sometimes squeeze more interest out of so little to work with that one has to admire his persistence. He certainly sets up Vera's fate with style, even though Roberts' fate seems perfunctory to me. No one, I hope, would call Detour a great film. In my opinion, it's not even a great noir. But it succeeds as great pulp fiction. When that highway comes on the screen, when we see the credits and when we start to hear Al Robert's voice-over, we know we're in for a cheap, sleazy ride...and an entertaining one, too.

First, the movie moves quickly. There is absolutely no wasted time, even when Ulmer is padding out a few shots. Second, Tom Neal is perfectly cast. He has a petulant, greasy face and a plump, weak mouth. Neal was not a sympathetic or likable actor. In what career he had, which wasn't much, he usually was at his best whining or playing bullies. Here, he's just weak. His career was effectively over when he beat Franchot Tone nearly to a pulp over a bimbo actress named Barbara Payton. A few years later he married and then was accused of murdering his wife with a gunshot to the head. He spent several years in prison on a manslaughter conviction and died of a heart attack a few months after he was released. Not much to admire here. Ann Savage is so over the top as the tough Vera that we sometimes do a double take over how she handles her dialogue. Still, the two of them, perhaps inadvertently, do full justice to the concept of Detour as full-bodied pulp fiction. Third, the script is great. Pulp, when it works, is sleazy, dirty entertainment. That's Detour. Neal and Savage make this fatalistic pulp cartoon vivid, not by how skilled they are, but by how well they meet the conventions of pulp action. Fourth, let's hear it for Edgar Ulmer. Some of Ulmer's films -- Strange Illusion, The Strange Woman, for example -- are fun to watch but none of them, in my view, are worth spending too much time thinking about. Like Val Lewton, Ulmer was a man of limited talent who could sometimes squeeze more interest out of so little to work with that one has to admire his persistence. He certainly sets up Vera's fate with style, even though Roberts' fate seems perfunctory to me. No one, I hope, would call Detour a great film. In my opinion, it's not even a great noir. But it succeeds as great pulp fiction.

Whichever way you turn, Fate sticks out a foot to trip you. Roberts, played by Tom Neal, is the whining, complaining protagonist in Detour, one of the worst, and best, pulp noirs you'll ever enjoy. And if Roberts doesn't have a good moment in any of the film's 67 minutes, you will if you get a kick out of pulp fiction so ripe it'll remind you of how old Charles Haskell's corpse is. Roberts, a piano player in a New York nightclub, was hitch hiking to L.A. to reunite with the woman he loves, his girlfriend Sue. When Haskell stops and gives him a ride, then dies of a heart attack, Roberts makes the first of many bad decisions. Haskell had several hundred in his wallet and three big, raw scratches on one hand. Wouldn't you know it, after ditching the body, taking the cash, the car and Haskell's identity, Roberts winds up stopping to pick up a hitchhiker...who turns out to be the dame who gave Haskell those scratches. Man, she looked like she'd just been thrown off the crummiest freight train in the world, Roberts says. We can see for ourselves. Vera (Ann Savage) is tough as nails. She's a tramp. She's poison. She knows Roberts isn't Haskell. She sets a hook in Roberts' mouth and pulls him around from one scheme to the next to get money. When Roberts finally resists...well, see the movie.

The same too can be said about the dramatic element of the film, with many emotionally powerful moments being contrasted with the bland and ineffective.Potentially, Forrest Gump could have been a strong, intensely moving saga of the life of an extraordinary - though slightly 'stupid' - human being who's outlook on life could certainly teach us all a thing of two about what should really be important to us. Gump's naivety and basic values of friendship and love make him akin to another delightful yet simple character, Mickey Rooney's Bill, a mentally challenged man who's only care was the people close to him.Zemeckis does achieve inspiration occasionally -symbolism is interestingly used at the beginning and end of the picture, to represent Forrest's biggest responsibility coming into his life and then moving on in it's natural course - but for the most part he approaches the movie as a comedy and so wastes the opportunity to create some truly memorable cinema.Tom Hanks successfully tackles yet another challenging role, though hardly triumphantly. Though Forrest's life is a roller coaster of ups, downs and sensational events (too much so I must say), Hanks gets very little chance to display a versatile range of emotions, and he doesn't even have the most interesting character.As Gump's childhood sweetheart Jenny, Robin Wright portrays with conviction a troubled, tormented and haunted character whose terrible childhood has left her with no self worth. Forrest is the only man who has ever respected and loved her for who she is. Also in strong support is a very impressive Gary Sinise as the bitter Lt. Dan Taylor, a man infuriated with Gump for saving his life, only to have to live it as a cripple. Trapped in a wheelchair and feeling cheated out of his destiny, the Lieutenant turns in desperation to booze and fast women.It is these two people, both of whom influence Forrest's life greatly, that are by far the most intriguing characters, and it's a shame their parts weren't developed more fully in this film. One mustn't forget the evergreen Sally Field either.

While he's recently gone a little more measured and controlled with style (relatively speaking) with In the Mood for Love and 2046, it's mostly in that he's now using things like dollies and steadi-cams. Looking at Chungking Express and, particularly, Fallen Angels, he reveals himself as a filmmaker total in trust with a style that in other hands would be simply amateurish. His camera, led on by Christopher Doyle, follows along these characters like in a slightly feverish documentary, with the accompanied narration adding the emphasis on inner thoughts and details. It's a crime drama, but it's also a fresh way to look at material that has a little bit of quirk, a heap-load of attitude, and at least a good lot of romance, or the lack of it or the pining for it with these characters. It's equally sweet and rough-edged, like an adorable motorcycle.For plot, there's not much two male characters, one is a hit-man who's starting to feel the pressure of his job (ironically, he describes it as being a good one early on as I'm a lazy person. I like people to arrange things for me), and breaks off from his partner, a woman who cleans up his 'messes' of mass destruction, and then falls for a strange blonde girl. The other is a mute ex-con who robs people by being obnoxious at various one-night-stand type of jobs, and in the process meeting a girl whom has a freak-out one night (there's an amazing scene, I should add, where in one shot we see him fall completely for this girl with a soft blues song playing behind him describe this as his first love). At least, that's as much as I gathered from the essentials; there's also a sub-plot with the mute kid, He Zwhiu, and his father as he starts to videotape him all the time. But Wong isn't interested in plot mechanics as two central facets mood of a scene on technical fronts, and a sensibility that's close to poetic intent.Wong's camera moves in a way that is a little dizzying, and it feels like it should be a shamble, a fiasco of an art-house item that doesn't transition well to the US. But it becomes apparent that its form is, at least, consistent to the intent at hand. We're so aware of the style that the characters are seemingly organic from this urban, post-modern spread. They're more than a little alienated (watch that shot where the woman is in the café, and the fight breaks out behind her without flinching an eyelash to the situation), and they have the tendencies of youth trapped in a situation they can only break out of (for one it's a way of life as work that gets mixed up due to emotions with the partner, the other with his father and going past disrobing the homeless and conning a family with ice cream).Wong Kar Wai presents this amusingly at times, a brisk sense of humor dropped in to let the audience know 'it's OK to laugh here and there, they ARE human after all with all their idiosyncrasies'. But at the same time there's a sorrow to the material that is given life by the hand-held, by the shots of characters in mirrors, by mixed media, by black and white shots thrown in, by editing that cuts off the head of the 180 degree rule here and there, by pumping in sad music and it does come close to diluting the emotional impact of the characters's fates. And yet, Wong has the soul of a romantic at heart, so to speak, and despite the fact that there's some pretty violence scenes in the picture (done in that hyper-speed style that is a little slow, a little fast in a way, as one has seen in many HK crime films) there's an intelligence that steers it from being TOO sloppy.This may be arguable, to be sure, in either direction; some may even call it a masterpiece of post-modernism as well as those who can't stand it period. I don't necessarily think it's even Kar-Wai's best film. But it inspires so many fresh images and thoughts I can't discard it as a warped slip-up from an otherwise avant-garde darling.

I don't necessarily think it's even Kar-Wai's best film. But it inspires so many fresh images and thoughts I can't discard it as a warped slip-up from an otherwise avant-garde darling.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"27 January 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Wong Kar Wai doesn't play by the rules, and those who respond positively to his films wouldn't want it any other way. While he's recently gone a little more measured and controlled with style (relatively speaking) with In the Mood for Love and 2046, it's mostly in that he's now using things like dollies and steadi-cams. Looking at Chungking Express and, particularly, Fallen Angels, he reveals himself as a filmmaker total in trust with a style that in other hands would be simply amateurish. His camera, led on by Christopher Doyle, follows along these characters like in a slightly feverish documentary, with the accompanied narration adding the emphasis on inner thoughts and details. It's a crime drama, but it's also a fresh way to look at material that has a little bit of quirk, a heap-load of attitude, and at least a good lot of romance, or the lack of it or the pining for it with these characters. It's equally sweet and rough-edged, like an adorable motorcycle.For plot, there's not much two male characters, one is a hit-man who's starting to feel the pressure of his job (ironically, he describes it as being a good one early on as I'm a lazy person. I like people to arrange things for me), and breaks off from his partner, a woman who cleans up his 'messes' of mass destruction, and then falls for a strange blonde girl. The other is a mute ex-con who robs people by being obnoxious at various one-night-stand type of jobs, and in the process meeting a girl whom has a freak-out one night (there's an amazing scene, I should add, where in one shot we see him fall completely for this girl with a soft blues song playing behind him describe this as his first love). At least, that's as much as I gathered from the essentials; there's also a sub-plot with the mute kid, He Zwhiu, and his father as he starts to videotape him all the time. But Wong isn't interested in plot mechanics as two central facets mood of a scene on technical fronts, and a sensibility that's close to poetic intent.Wong's camera moves in a way that is a little dizzying, and it feels like it should be a shamble, a fiasco of an art-house item that doesn't transition well to the US. But it becomes apparent that its form is, at least, consistent to the intent at hand. We're so aware of the style that the characters are seemingly organic from this urban, post-modern spread. They're more than a little alienated (watch that shot where the woman is in the café, and the fight breaks out behind her without flinching an eyelash to the situation), and they have the tendencies of youth trapped in a situation they can only break out of (for one it's a way of life as work that gets mixed up due to emotions with the partner, the other with his father and going past disrobing the homeless and conning a family with ice cream).Wong Kar Wai presents this amusingly at times, a brisk sense of humor dropped in to let the audience know 'it's OK to laugh here and there, they ARE human after all with all their idiosyncrasies'. But at the same time there's a sorrow to the material that is given life by the hand-held, by the shots of characters in mirrors, by mixed media, by black and white shots thrown in, by editing that cuts off the head of the 180 degree rule here and there, by pumping in sad music and it does come close to diluting the emotional impact of the characters's fates.

Both have problems to be related with people and they spend their time hanging around and bothering creeps. When they met Seymour (Steve Buscemi) who is a social outsider who loves to collect old vinyl records, the life of Enid will change forever.The screenplay of this memorable film was based on a comic book with the same name, created by Daniel Clowes. The plot is very simple but excellent and there are a lot of memorable dialogs and two memorable characters that makes this film as one of the most original films ever and that is, without a doubt, Terry Zwigoff's masterpiece. The way that the film start, when we can see how Enid and Rebecca spend their time, is really strange in consequence of the strange attitude of the characters . I mean when they follow the satanic couple is really bizarre but later they just forget about them in less than a minute and they stop in a restaurant, and it's even more bizarre. And there are lots of this kind of scenes that makes this characters truly memorable and the best thing is that they are believable. And the other main character, Seymour, is also great. The lines of all the characters are really great and the critic to the ignorant society too, specially the scene when a man is looking for the film 8 1\/2 by Fellini and the video clerk give him the film Nine 1\/2 Weeks with Mickey Rourke.Well, the cast is perfect; Tora Birch is amazing in the best character of the film, Scarlett Johansson is perfect in all the ways and Steve Buscemi is excellent like always in a memorable character. The rest of the cast is excellent too like the rest of the secondary characters like Josh (Brad Renfro) or Roberta Allsworth (Illeana Douglas). And the music is another perfect thing of this film just like in every other masterpiece like this one.Conclusion i really love this film that is highly re-watchable and for me is one the best films of the 00's and amazingly original. I haven't read the comic book but Daniel Clowes, the creator, write the film too so i think is very similar to the comic book, that i'm going to get soon. So watch this film, is funny thanks to the great satire to the society but also is sad thanks to one character who doesn't know what to do with her life and is quite disappointed with the rest of the world.

It was released in 1972 and there is hardly any doubt in my mind that it has truly stood the test of time. It is a brilliant adaptation of the bestseller novel 'The Godfather' by Mario Puzo.The Godfather is a gangster movie set in the late 1940s & early 1950s around the lives of the Corleone family. Corleones are an Italian American Family in New York headed by 'Don' Vito Corleone. Vito has three sons, Sonny, Fredo & Michael and a daughter named Connie who is married to Carlo Rizzi. He also has an adopted son named Tom Hagen (German-Irish) who is the 'Consiglerie'(Advisor) of the family. The family is into the business of gambling, unions & liquor. They have all the judges and politicians 'in their pocket'. The Corleones also have influences over the media & the cops. They form a crime syndicate of 5 Italian- American families who have a stronghold over different parts of New York. Vito is assisted in his work by his 'Caporagemes' namely Clemenza & Tessio who carry out his orders.The family is faced with problems when the refusal of Don Vito to join & support the drug business along with Virgil Sollozo leads to other families (Barzini, Tattaglia, Stracchi & Cuneo) going against them. The bad blood between the families results in Don Vito getting shot. Sonny, (The 'hothead')who is the eldest son gets killed and Michael has to step-up in this time of need. The emergence of Michael who was earlier reluctant to join the family business as the head of the family is the highlight of the movie. Michael imbibes all the unique qualities of his father and takes revenge for his family. I don't know where to begin with as far as appreciating this movie is concerned. It has the most amazing characterizations with all the characters being well etched and having their own individuality. If Vito was the 'reasonable man' who valued his family, Sonny is a hot head, Michael is rational, Fredo is weak & stupid, Tom is measured, Sollozo is ruthless. Even the supporting cast of Clemenza, Tessio, Don Barzini, Connie, Captain Mcklusky, Jhonny Fontaine,Jack Woltz,Mama etc are extremely well defined. The dialogues in the movie pack some serious punch. Some of them which I can recall on my fingertips are  It's not personal Sonny, its strictly business,  Only don't tell me that you are innocent , because it insults my intelligence & it makes me very angry and finally  I'll make him an offer he cannot refuse. The screenplay seamlessly gels with the movie. Who can forget the scene at the Louis restaurant, the baptism scene at the end, or Tom Hagen informing his Don about Sonny's death. The movie has got this whole Italian milieu which takes you in a different world, makes you feel like a member of the Corleone family and identify with each and every character. Last but not the least, a tribute should be paid to the entire cast of the movie. No one could have acted better than Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael, James Caan as Sonny or Robert Duvall as Tom. Even the performance of the supporting cast is phenomenal.I would like to sincerely thank Francis Coppola for putting up such a gem of a movie which has really caught my imagination.

Today, we would call them Star Wars crowds.But The Exorcist came first.Like Citizen Kane or 2001 A Space Odyssey, it is one of those rare moments in film history when someone does something totally different, yet somehow, by luck or sixth sense or divine guidance, seems to know exactly what to do.Right from the start, the off-rhythm pounding of the Iraqi blacksmiths gets under our skin, a beautifully subtle way of suggesting something is not right with the world's heartbeat.The indecipherable right-to-left Arabic writing also plays a role here, a relatively strange sight to American audiences, and a prelude to the backwards speech, backwards heads, and backwards nature in scenes to come. Reversal and conflict are constantly reinforced thematically, through juxtapositions of incompatible images the sacred and the profane, the light and the dark, the natural and the unnatural. But it's not all subtlety. The prologue sequence ends with a heroic shot straight out of High Noon, as the exorcist suddenly finds himself face to face with the statue of a grinning, reptilian demon. Human flesh against indestructible stone.Then a marvelous transition. Old to new. From Iraq to Georgetown. A movie actress switches on a light in a dark bedroom. And the sound of rats in the attic, even though the home's caretaker insists quite believably, No rats. Scampering rats. Shrieking gulls. Lions devouring prey.All the sound effects are chosen with a merciless attention to human instinctive psychology. They set the stage for evil.Science alongside superstition. As a young girl becomes progressively sicker, her behavior ever more bizarre, there seems little difference between a medical laboratory, with its bloodletting and its whirling x-ray machines, and the rituals of a witchdoctor. We meet our young hero, the suffering priest\/psychiatrist, further blurring the line between magic and reality. And he brings in yet another paradoxical combination faith, and the loss of faith. By the way, his name is Karass, which is Greek for cross. At least I think it is. Anyway, it should be.The film's most powerful oxymoron is undoubtedly the most shocking, most horrible scene in the history of cinema. It makes one inescapable point. This is not a disease. This is not a dream. This is not even a lower-echelon evil spirit from some haunted house movie. Only the Devil can do this.An interesting sidebar. During this scene, Ellen Burstyn is supposed to be sent flying by a vicious backhand blow. Of course, this was before the era of digital wizardry, so she had to be physically strapped into a harness and then pulled across the room. As the rehearsals wore on, she warned director Friedkin that she was starting to get hurt. Friedkin agreed that the next take would be more gentle. He lied.He covertly instructed the special effects designer to let her have it. She went flying like a rag doll, screaming in agony as she thudded to the hard wooden floor. And Friedkin, the consummate artist, dollied in to get that last close-up, before calling the paramedics. Now that's what movies are all about.This movie is what movies are all about.
