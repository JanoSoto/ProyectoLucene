I guess it's the fame Kirsten Dunst got over the years (Get Over it, Strike!, Bring It On, etc.) I only liked her in The Virgin Suicides and Levity (actually she played a similar character there), and thought that in Spiderman she did the job ok. On the other hand, there was this guy (Jay Hernandez) whom I had never heard about, but I figured he would just be the cool latin cute guy stereotype in teen movies. On imdb.com the movie was rated 6.5 which was pretty good for this kind of films, and had overall good comments. I usually have a peek at these two factors before watching a movie, but they're obviously not essential. But enough about my expectations. Let's talk about what I experienced.The plot is really basic and you feel like you've seen this story a thousand times before. But... sometimes it's the way in which something is told that makes the difference. And I believe this is why it got me. It got me from the very beginning, and I just wanted to see scene after scene. It glued me to the seat at some point. I felt for the characters, which is important. They had depth, they had background. I identified myself with Jay's character, as he always tried to do the right thing and avoided trouble. The differences and the connection between the two worlds were very well done. The acting was also good, especially Kirsten Dunst and her father. Jay was ok, I think he really didn't have to try very hard for this role.SPOILERS AHEADSome reviewers said that the movie made them reflect about certain aspects of life, or something like that. Well, I guess I don't need a movie to do that for myself, but maybe after you've seen it, you might start to wonder what would be really important for your life. Jay had his family, that sacrificed hard for him to go to school. He was the only one in the family that could have some sort of career ahead of him. And falling in love with Nicole would probably mess it up, not to mention escaping town with her. And Nicole, she had everything in the material field, but lacked love (although she did have that weird friend). She found in Carlos what she needed. The story develops on an ideal pace and style, making you feel that every scene has a purpose and that you are not wasting your time. Even the videoclips of their relationship were very fun to watch. The dramatic component of the picture is well mixed in the overall. Not too much, not too less.Overall, this is a good nice film. If you happen to rent it, you will have a good time.
