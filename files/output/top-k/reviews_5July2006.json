[{"date":"5 July 2006","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Tom Tykwer's Run Lola Run is not my favorite of his films, but 2002's Heaven. All three productions that I've seen under his direction (The Warrior and the Empress being the third) have l'amour fou as thematic center, revealing a very strong romantic vein in Tykwer, that reaches its zenith in Heaven, an original script written by late Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski, with his colleague Krzysztof Piesiewicz. But when it was released I found Lola so surprisingly good and fresh, with its clever structure, game of chances, lost opportunities, what-if's and feel-good tone, that I can overlook its roots on fashionable cinematic techniques and sounds, which will probably hurt it in a future test of time. It is a definite product of its time, with a tender heart instead of guns and cynic babbling among hustlers and killers, and as such it will have to be evaluated, even if future audiences may find its concerns outdated or irrelevant. Or possibly not in the end, love and materialism, dreams and realism, are always significant subjects in works of art.

The story is very interesting &#150; the world has been taken over by a very humanoid alien life form that is exploiting the earth for its minerals. Most humans are enslaved, and those that are not, have degenerated to a low level of technology. In spite of a significant difference in technology, the humans revolt, and incredibly, win. But given this interesting story line, this is an incredibly idiotic film. These aliens rule the universe, but are incredibly stupid in how they relate to each other. In spite of much evidence to the contrary, they believe that humans cannot think. They are so obviously based on the Klingons that the story borders on plagiarism. Some of the special effects were very nice (as when they aliens teach Johnny Tyler their language). For all the hardships humans face, all of them appear well fed, well groomed, have great teeth and look great in general. The movie is lost in execution &#150; a nice opportunity lost.

A movie that is certainly confusing at first sitting, it is that rare commodity the movie we like to talk about later. Like Memento or Barton Fink, people will find themselves dissecting the minutiae of the film after it's over.Also impressive is the fact that Tom Cruise, one of Hollywood's famed pretty boys, spends at least two-thirds of the film either hidden under a mask, or horribly disfigured. Not a role many other actors would jump to take.On the down side, Vanilla Sky, (a re-make ?) is basically an Art House or Indie film starring a big Hollywood actor. What could have been an interesting view on the hidden nature of man, or alternate\/multiple realities, or even a study on the nature of reality itself, instead ends up like an art house rip-off of Total Recall.Rating B- \/ C+FYI 1) When did the universe change so much that Banky from Chasing Amy could get a lead role playing opposite Tom Cruise? 2) When did Penelope Cruz get the role of Indecipherable Speaker, ala Brad Pitt in Snatch or Fenster in The Usual Suspects? 3) When did Paul McCartney last have a decent single? Here, with the title track.
