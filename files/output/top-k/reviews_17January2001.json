I had lost myself in a story before, but never so completely, never with such an emotional response to the characters and their fates.  For the past few years my health has stopped me from reading, and this is the book I have missed the most.Seeing an adaptation of a book you love is always hard, because you have to trade your imagination for that of the director and screenwriter.  I know what Scout looks like to me, I know what Jem and Dill and Atticus sound like, I know what it was like to live in Macomb and to be scared of the Radley house.  I was nervous watching the movie, hoping the producers would not lose or betray the spirit of the book, but their imagination was mine and everything in their adaptation was near-perfect.Like the book, the film is narrated by Scout and is played to perfection by Mary Badham.  She captures Scout's tomboy spirit wonderfully and is at the absolute centre of the film.  It's always refreshing to see a child actor who isn't sickly or over-cute or wooden, and the same can be said for Jem and Dill.  Gregory Peck's Atticus was as he should be; quietly idealistic, passionate without really showing it.  He won the Oscar for his performance, and while it was probably deserved, the kids outshone the adult cast effortlessly.It would have been easy for the film to have followed only the trial of Tom Robinson, an African-American charged with the rape of a white woman, but it would have killed the spirit of the story; the trial was just another part of Scout's childhood.  She played with Jem and Dill, she saw the trial, she went to school for the first time, and she finally met Boo Radley.  This approach gives the movie its quiet, understated morality and gentle dignity that made the book everything it was.It brings with it the powerful contrast between the innocence of childhood and the uncomfortable realities of the adult world, most famously in the scene where Scout talks to a lynch mob on its way to kill Robinson.  It makes these points perfectly, never overstating them, never forcing them down your throat, telling only the truth.The story's power comes in its refusal to find easy answers, in its willingness to bring tragedy to its characters, and the movie captures this perfectly, with the same kind of understatement.  It is really a wonderful adaptation.Inevitably, some details of the story were left out, but most of the important ones were there, with only the children's growing friendship with Boo Radley given less attention than it may have deserved.  That is the only criticism I can offer.Until I can read again, I'll love this movie as I love the book.  It was a peerless adaptation.  If you don't love it for its gentle storytelling and quiet, understated idealism, your name is John Grisham and its depths are wasted on you.

I like it quite a lot. It's just that, well, as much as I like Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart, I just don't think that their skills as actors are very high (well, Bergman's good, while I would pick any number of actresses from foreign films or silent films or more modern films). This is because I do not think true acting, at least for the American talkies, came about until the likes of James Dean and Marlon Brando. Acting before seems only to have been born from the style of acting you see in the theater. I have never been a huge fan of the theater because of this same reason. Actors act only with their voices. They have to get what they are saying heard, so nothing ever sounds sincere. There are so few silent moments.His Girl Friday is a great example of this. There is not a second where people aren't talking a mile a minute. Even when the dialogue is great, it starts to grate on your patience. But this is just a small criticism of mine. Although I would completely sympathize with someone disliking this film, I liked it a lot. Even if the dialogue does grate, it is still great. And the actors, even if they do act as if they're on a stage and not as if they were human beings, are very good. Cary Grant is always great to watch. His abilities are effortless. I could never imagine him in a serious role (I'm sure he had to have had a few; my only other Cary Grant experiences are two of his Hitchcock films To Catch a Thief and North By Northwest). He's a lot like Bogart, and any number of other stars (as opposed to actors), whose persona is so fun that we go along with him wherever he goes. Rosalind Russel is an actress I've never seen before. If I ever do, I won't be able to see much beyond the persona she establishes as Hildy Johnson. She may have been a very popular actress, for all I know, but even if this were her first film, she holds her own with Grant. The supporting character actors, especially the other newsmen, the gangster, the sheriff, the mayor, etc, are all very good. My only other complaint is that the few dramatic moments in the film tend to work against the overall comedic mood of the picture.

Because-- while there are plenty of laughs to be had (especially early on)-- in the end, there is a lot more bite and substance to it than first meets the eye.  Enough to definitely raise it far above the `fluff' piece many will perceive it to be, if only due to some shallow reviews and the theatrical trailer currently being shown, which gives only the vaguest notion of what this movie is really all about.  In fact, once most of the `cute' stuff is out of the way (about a third of the way through), the film really starts to get good,with a message about decency that is worthwhile, if only it can penetrate the formidable barrier of the viewer with an attention span barely able to accommodate an episode of `Friends.'  Beyond the humor, there is a story here about a man named Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) who literally receives the shock of his life, and afterwards must deal with who he is by coming to terms with his past, realizing the truth about himself in the present, and understanding what his future will be if he does not change his ways .  It's something of a contemporary take on `A Christmas Carol,' with Nick an egotistical, self-centered, witty (In his own eyes) Scrooge; a veritable legend in his own mind, which is not-- as he comes to find out-- necessarily the way he is perceived by many of those around him, especially the women in his professional life. \tThe screenplay, written by Cathy Yuspa and Josh Goldsmith, is extremely insightful and brought to the screen with equal acuity by director Meyers, who goes to great lengths at the beginning of the film to explain Nick's exaggerated chauvinism, what made him the `Man's man' he has become.  And while it is clever and effective, closer scrutiny in the editing room may have benefited the overall film, as his character is somewhat `overly' established.  But just about at the point when you're saying to yourself, `All right I get it!' Meyers grabs the helm with both hands and suddenly the ship is at full mast and on course, where she keeps it for the rest of the journey.  The turning point comes after Nick's visit to a marriage counselor (a terrific cameo by Bette Midler) with whom he had had business some years before.  It's as if not only Nick, but Meyers as well, had heeded Bette's advice.   \tMel Gibson does a good job of getting into Nick Marshall's skin, and he's to be commended for going out on a limb and taking on a character that may not be immediately embraced by even die-hard Gibson fans.  It's a testimony to his ability as an actor, though, because he does make Nick the epitome of chauvinism, and except for the few throw-back Neanderthals (women as well as men) still in existence who subscribe to the `Man's man' theory of de-evolution, Nick will effect the same response from the audience that he does in the minds of many of the women who surround him in the movie.  It's only when you've had a chance to consider Gibson's performance at arm's length that you will realize how good he is in this film.  On the other hand, the real saving grace of this movie is immediately discernible, and that is the performance of the wonderful Helen Hunt.  As Darcy McGuire, the professional hired to lead the ad agency for whom Nick works into the Twenty-first Century, Hunt is nothing less than sensational.  One of the most gifted, expressive actors in the business, she raises the level of the drama (not to mention the comedy) by succinctly conveying the strength--   and at the same time the vulnerability-- of Darcy, while exhibiting a depth of emotion that adds so much to the impact (and the success) of the film.  And, in a notable supporting role, Judy Greer is memorable as Erin, a lonely young woman who works at the ad agency.  It's the `Tiny Tim' role of the film, and though a small part, it figures prominently in revealing Nick's inner-most feelings at a pivotal moment of the film. \tRounding out the supporting cast are Alan Alda (Dan), Marisa Tomei (Lola), Ashley Johnson (Alexandra), Mark Feuerstein (Morgan), Lauren Holly (Gigi), Delta Burke (Eve), Valerie Perrine (Margo) and Sarah Paulson (Annie).  What Meyers has created here is a mixed-bag, sleight-of-hand bit of entertainment that is so much more than what it seems to be on the surface that it is bound to evoke an equally mixed-bag of reactions (positive and negative) from the audience.  It's amusing-- downright funny at times-- but also exasperating.  To receive the full rewards offered by `What Women Want,' you're going to have to give it something as well.  If you do, you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you get in return.  And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.

It's something of a contemporary take on `A Christmas Carol,' with Nick an egotistical, self-centered, witty (In his own eyes) Scrooge; a veritable legend in his own mind, which is not-- as he comes to find out-- necessarily the way he is perceived by many of those around him, especially the women in his professional life. \tThe screenplay, written by Cathy Yuspa and Josh Goldsmith, is extremely insightful and brought to the screen with equal acuity by director Meyers, who goes to great lengths at the beginning of the film to explain Nick's exaggerated chauvinism, what made him the `Man's man' he has become.  And while it is clever and effective, closer scrutiny in the editing room may have benefited the overall film, as his character is somewhat `overly' established.  But just about at the point when you're saying to yourself, `All right I get it!' Meyers grabs the helm with both hands and suddenly the ship is at full mast and on course, where she keeps it for the rest of the journey.  The turning point comes after Nick's visit to a marriage counselor (a terrific cameo by Bette Midler) with whom he had had business some years before.  It's as if not only Nick, but Meyers as well, had heeded Bette's advice.   \tMel Gibson does a good job of getting into Nick Marshall's skin, and he's to be commended for going out on a limb and taking on a character that may not be immediately embraced by even die-hard Gibson fans.  It's a testimony to his ability as an actor, though, because he does make Nick the epitome of chauvinism, and except for the few throw-back Neanderthals (women as well as men) still in existence who subscribe to the `Man's man' theory of de-evolution, Nick will effect the same response from the audience that he does in the minds of many of the women who surround him in the movie.  It's only when you've had a chance to consider Gibson's performance at arm's length that you will realize how good he is in this film.  On the other hand, the real saving grace of this movie is immediately discernible, and that is the performance of the wonderful Helen Hunt.  As Darcy McGuire, the professional hired to lead the ad agency for whom Nick works into the Twenty-first Century, Hunt is nothing less than sensational.  One of the most gifted, expressive actors in the business, she raises the level of the drama (not to mention the comedy) by succinctly conveying the strength--   and at the same time the vulnerability-- of Darcy, while exhibiting a depth of emotion that adds so much to the impact (and the success) of the film.  And, in a notable supporting role, Judy Greer is memorable as Erin, a lonely young woman who works at the ad agency.  It's the `Tiny Tim' role of the film, and though a small part, it figures prominently in revealing Nick's inner-most feelings at a pivotal moment of the film. \tRounding out the supporting cast are Alan Alda (Dan), Marisa Tomei (Lola), Ashley Johnson (Alexandra), Mark Feuerstein (Morgan), Lauren Holly (Gigi), Delta Burke (Eve), Valerie Perrine (Margo) and Sarah Paulson (Annie).  What Meyers has created here is a mixed-bag, sleight-of-hand bit of entertainment that is so much more than what it seems to be on the surface that it is bound to evoke an equally mixed-bag of reactions (positive and negative) from the audience.  It's amusing-- downright funny at times-- but also exasperating.  To receive the full rewards offered by `What Women Want,' you're going to have to give it something as well.  If you do, you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you get in return.  And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8\/10.  \t                   ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"},{"date":"17 January 2001","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Manhattan is created in someways to be portrayed as a romantic comedy but it's much more than that.

Director Darren Aronofsky spends the better part of 100 minutes showing us what four drug addicts' brains on drugs look like.  And it ain't pretty.  At least one scene or another in `Requiem' will be as close as anyone who hasn't done crack, speed, cocaine or heroin will want to get.  If you've never dabbled in heavy drugs or know no-one that has experienced the horrors of drug addiction, or if you have not seen documentaries about drug abusers and their perils, then some scenes in Requiem' will likely shock you.Aronofsky's film is based upon the Hubert Selby, Jr. novel of the same title.  The novel is set in Coney Island, Brooklyn - a locale that is purposefully depicted as a barren wasteland in the film.  Harry (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are partners in drug delirium as they search for the high that will temporarily keep them from searching for the next high. Their pursuit of the American `dream' - insulation from society via drug craving and binging - will  not be stopped at any cost.  If stopped, desperation and destruction will start.  Anything will be done to stay sky-high, and away from reality.  Ditto for Sara (Ellen Burstyn, in a powerful performance), Harry's mother, and Marion (Jennifer Connelly), Harry's girlfriend.  The `dream' in the film's title is the living nightmare and illusion of reality for the drug-addled characters.  Between them they experience TV `stardom', sexual debasement, amputation (of the senses, the mind, or the body, or of all three?), and blood-splattered terror at a breakneck pace called fear.What you've read here is all you need to know about `Requiem For A Dream'. The film has no true substance or `story' structure (perhaps Selby's novel proves more rewarding) beyond its imagery, but maybe Aronofsky (who co-wrote the script with Selby) intends this.  After all, what kind of story is needed?  The visual poetry and claustrophobia of rapid-fire images, which at first look like gimmickry, or promises a cinematic overkill - instead progresses to become a subjective character all its own - thus speaking for itself - and is the only element sustaining `Requiem'.  The visuals and filmmaking techniques are fascinating.  (Also see `Natural Born Killers'-- which is faster and more furious in its imagery and visual effects, yet succeeds by making social statements through its satirical approach to the media's and the American public's perverse fascination with, and lust for, violence.  With `Requiem', Aronofsky makes a play on this theme, with TV as addiction and its metaphor as a drug.)Film students or anyone interested in cinema and filmmaking should experience `Requiem' in a movie theater solely for that purpose, for that is all the film is good for.  (Seeing or not seeing the film will not impact those teens or others who desire to use drugs, yet the film as seen in a movie theatre, will keep its audience on edge.)  The impressive editing (Jay Rabinowitz) makes `Requiem' a dizzying onslaught of shots, distorted camera lenses, jump-cuts, slow-motions, hyper-speeded lenses, fishbowls, handheld shivers and numerous other camera tricks and visual effects.  The order and containment of these devices is so rhythmic and routine that their frequent repetition can be frustrating - though the frustration represents the drug addict's banality and robotic existence, enslaved by the power and allure of the high-wire heroin act.  The visual tricks and camerawork might also represent a dance that the drug is doing in the characters' (and the movie audience's) heads.  `Requiem' is an excellent example and reminder of cinema's devastating power of imagery to shape the minds and perceptions of moviegoers worldwide - which it has done for over a century.  Where drugs and delusion are concerned, most of the images of `Requiem' do not paralyze our psyches, but leave a profound and indelible impact on them.  Some of the film's scenes and visuals resonate beyond the end credits.Again, `Requiem For A Dream' speaks volumes with its technical aspects. If dialogue were kept to the barest minimum the film would have played like an MTV video - and it would have been better this way - but it probably would still keep those with short attention spans away.  The camerawork and visual manipulations are of a sufficiently intense force to be violent in and of themselves, even to the point of constituting an assault on some viewers' senses.  Darren Aronofsky's film is not a lesson or cautionary tale about the dangers of drug addiction.  Rather, `Requiem For A Dream' is the experience of drug-addiction and its accompanying state(s) of mind, and the cravings (or lows) in between the nano-second highs.  The film's final crescendo is astounding -- propulsion through a visual hell that this reviewer has never before witnessed quite like this in an American film.Visual wizardry (Matthew Libatique's excellent cinematography) and clever imagery however, do not obscure the subtlety of the equally sinister camera effects and devices used to animalize or demonize several Blacks (particularly Keith David's character) that appear late in the film.  As in `Traffic', such subtlety where Black characters are concerned is used solely to serve to amplify and further dramatize the drug-entrenched decline of the film's lead white character (in `Requiem,' it's Marion.)  This critical question should be asked and demands a sincere answer are films by white filmmakers about drugs and decadence ever capable of avoiding subtle, racist inferences - namely, that the white character has hit rock-bottom for sure now, because he\/she has got in too deep with the `undesirables' (readBlacks) of the world??   And what purpose do these depictions of Black characters serve within these films' context overall?  Yes, in the real world Black drug-abusers exist, but on film these persons are inevitably brought in only to set the scene or framework of a white lead character's existence and decline.  And third, can a Black drug-addict EVER be given a modicum of complexity by a white writer\/filmmaker, instead of the cardboard treatment that such addicts are largely afforded in both `Traffic' and `Requiem For A Dream'?  While an affirmative answer to that third question is searched for, if one cares to, one can watch Spike Lee's `Jungle Fever' (and to an extent, Lee's `Clockers') for real, live, (not) and in stereo (typed) three-dimensional Black drug-addict characters, who impact a film's story in meaningful ways.

With `Requiem', Aronofsky makes a play on this theme, with TV as addiction and its metaphor as a drug.)Film students or anyone interested in cinema and filmmaking should experience `Requiem' in a movie theater solely for that purpose, for that is all the film is good for.  (Seeing or not seeing the film will not impact those teens or others who desire to use drugs, yet the film as seen in a movie theatre, will keep its audience on edge.)  The impressive editing (Jay Rabinowitz) makes `Requiem' a dizzying onslaught of shots, distorted camera lenses, jump-cuts, slow-motions, hyper-speeded lenses, fishbowls, handheld shivers and numerous other camera tricks and visual effects.  The order and containment of these devices is so rhythmic and routine that their frequent repetition can be frustrating - though the frustration represents the drug addict's banality and robotic existence, enslaved by the power and allure of the high-wire heroin act.  The visual tricks and camerawork might also represent a dance that the drug is doing in the characters' (and the movie audience's) heads.  `Requiem' is an excellent example and reminder of cinema's devastating power of imagery to shape the minds and perceptions of moviegoers worldwide - which it has done for over a century.  Where drugs and delusion are concerned, most of the images of `Requiem' do not paralyze our psyches, but leave a profound and indelible impact on them.  Some of the film's scenes and visuals resonate beyond the end credits.Again, `Requiem For A Dream' speaks volumes with its technical aspects. If dialogue were kept to the barest minimum the film would have played like an MTV video - and it would have been better this way - but it probably would still keep those with short attention spans away.  The camerawork and visual manipulations are of a sufficiently intense force to be violent in and of themselves, even to the point of constituting an assault on some viewers' senses.  Darren Aronofsky's film is not a lesson or cautionary tale about the dangers of drug addiction.  Rather, `Requiem For A Dream' is the experience of drug-addiction and its accompanying state(s) of mind, and the cravings (or lows) in between the nano-second highs.  The film's final crescendo is astounding -- propulsion through a visual hell that this reviewer has never before witnessed quite like this in an American film.Visual wizardry (Matthew Libatique's excellent cinematography) and clever imagery however, do not obscure the subtlety of the equally sinister camera effects and devices used to animalize or demonize several Blacks (particularly Keith David's character) that appear late in the film.  As in `Traffic', such subtlety where Black characters are concerned is used solely to serve to amplify and further dramatize the drug-entrenched decline of the film's lead white character (in `Requiem,' it's Marion.)  This critical question should be asked and demands a sincere answer are films by white filmmakers about drugs and decadence ever capable of avoiding subtle, racist inferences - namely, that the white character has hit rock-bottom for sure now, because he\/she has got in too deep with the `undesirables' (readBlacks) of the world??   And what purpose do these depictions of Black characters serve within these films' context overall?  Yes, in the real world Black drug-abusers exist, but on film these persons are inevitably brought in only to set the scene or framework of a white lead character's existence and decline.  And third, can a Black drug-addict EVER be given a modicum of complexity by a white writer\/filmmaker, instead of the cardboard treatment that such addicts are largely afforded in both `Traffic' and `Requiem For A Dream'?  While an affirmative answer to that third question is searched for, if one cares to, one can watch Spike Lee's `Jungle Fever' (and to an extent, Lee's `Clockers') for real, live, (not) and in stereo (typed) three-dimensional Black drug-addict characters, who impact a film's story in meaningful ways.

Rodriquez is in the midst of taking down two different drug cartels in Mexico, where we learn that law enforcement is a profitable business. Javier is above all an honest man in his profession, determined only to recieve a little pay, stay alive, and do his job.Then the story moves to Ohio, where Judge Robert Wakefield, played to perfection by Michael Douglas who deserves a best actor nod, has just been appointed by the President of the United States as the new U.S. Drug Czar. Wakefield is a true crusader in his fight in the war on drugs, but his family life is near destruction when he realizes that his daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen), is doing drugs right under his nose, which poses as a threat on his professional life.The third account is that of federal agents Gordon and Castro, played by Boogie Nights alumnists Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman, who capture high profile drug kingpin Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer). They plan to keep Ruiz in custody and have him testify against against the DEA's principal target of the drug business, which leads directly to the fourth story.Around the same time the feds arrest Ruiz, San Diego DEA agents arrest top billionaire executive Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer). His wife, Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), is completely unaware of her husbands activities, until Carlos' business associate and lawyer Arnie Metzger (Dennis Quaid) informs her that Carlos is no a legitimate businessman, but the most wanted drug distributor in the nation. Helena is first stunned by the news, but then soon develops some criminalistic manuevers of her own in order to ensure her husband's safety from a life in jail.Traffic is without a doubt the most effective motion picture ever made about drugs and the terrible effect it has had on our government, as well as the youth of America. One distinctive aspect of the movie is the brilliant way Soderbergh switches the use of color in order to give his settings the proper look. The scenes in Ohio, are shot in dark metal like blue, while the scenes in Mexico consists of effective grainy, desaturated look, much in the same way Three Kings was shot. Soderbergh also puts some hand-held camera action to very good use in a number of key scenes.Traffic is an undeniable brilliant epic of a film with an effective message under its belt. It includes one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen before, and it has boosted its director, Steven Soderbergh, to movie-making stardom, in addition to directing last year's hit Erin Brockovich, which I didn't rank as high as most critics did.

There are no special effects, character development is relatively deliberate, and the complete storyline unfolds gradually, much like Lone Star does. Weaver's and Strathairn's characters remind me of the two leads in Limbo - good people who are just barely holding things in their lives together.

The film deals with relationships and the human resiliency that allows us to adapt.CAUTION -- SPOILERS FOLLOW --Things start to unravel when Alice, a grade-school nurse, allows a friend's (Theresa, Julianne Moore) little girl to wander off and drown in their farm pool. The girl actually dies a bit later in the hospital, only kept alive by machines. This happens about the time Alice is going half-crazy dealing with the brats at school, and especially the kid who seems to always be sick, and who once spit out medicine into her face, and she slapped him in angry reaction.

Those previews instilled in my mind a vision of a great civilization, highly reminiscent of ancient Egypt, on which the Egyptians had based their society.  This movie was nothing like that, and what it was did not make up for my disappointment.  Stargate is a generic Sci-Fi flick, pure and simple Meet the bad alien who was banished from one world only to make slaves of the people on another planet.  He's more powerful than the good guys, but maybe, if they all band together, they can use his own advanced technology against him.   On other notes, I find it hard to believe that in the period of 4000 years or so that these people didn't manage to rebel against Ra.  I mean, 4000 years is a long time.

In that regard `Chariots of Fire' is one of my favorite sports films.  What differentiates this film is that it is really a human story about sports rather than a pure sports story.  Based on a true story, it centers on two gifted athletes and their quest to run in the 1924 Olympics.  The first is Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a haughty sprinter with an obsession for winning.  Abrahams, who is Jewish, is a man with something to prove, mostly to himself.  His rival is Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), the first man to ever beat him in a sprint.  Liddell is a devout Christian and runs for the glory of God.There is an exquisite interplay of subtle themes in this film underlying the obvious sports tale.  There is the contrast of motives.  Abraham runs to validate his feeling of personal power, and his preoccupation with winning is actually motivated by his fear of losing.  His quest is torturous, and ultimately his victory empty, more of a relief than a triumph.  Liddell runs out of a desire to repay God for the physical gifts he has been given.  He is at peace with himself, but at odds with all those who want to control him.  Their rivalry represents a battle between the forces of the physical and spiritual.  Other themes pervade the film.  We have undercurrents of bigotry against the Jewish runner, a man of whom Cambridge was begrudgingly proud while berating him behind his back.  We have sinister political attempts at manipulation in the face of Liddell's staunch integrity in adhering to his principles.  Together, these forces combine to produce a film rich in drama and meaning.The film has been criticized for its inaccuracies.  Some say Abraham did not suffer from anti-Semitic bigotry and that he was wildly popular at Cambridge.  This does not necessarily mean he didn't feel inferior.  No one can know what childhood experiences might have affected his psyche.  Jackson Scholz was quoted as saying he never gave Liddell a note of encouragement on the track.  I have to agree that this was a bit of Hollywood drivel that didn't need to be there.  Additionally, Liddell knew weeks before that the heats would be on a Sunday, not just before the race as shown, and he was always scheduled to run the 400-meter race.  The meeting of political bigwigs that allowed him to switch from the 100 to the 400 was pure fabrication to emphasize his resistance to compromising his beliefs about running on the Sabbath.  However, these liberties can be forgiven because they enriched the story and did not change history in major ways.The direction by Hugh Hudson is powerful.  Hudson captures the feeling and excitement of track and field competition, as well as giving us numerous beautifully photographed scenes and a wonderful period rendering.  Though nominated for an Oscar, Hudson was unable to capitalize on the success of this film, and he has directed very few, mostly minor films since.  The music by Vangelis is also wonderful, and it won the Best Music Oscar.Ben Cross is fantastic as Abrahams.  He brings great intensity to Abrahams' single-minded obsession for winning.  Cross hasn't done much film work since, but has had a long and distinguished career in TV.  Ian Charleson is also excellent as Liddell, but his career went the same route as Cross'.This minor film was the sleeper of 1981, nominated for seven Academy Awards and winning four, including Best Picture.

Some people say this movie is scary, but it is absolutely not.  It's a good action flick with hilarious scenes.  If you like movies that are one part action and one part comedy, then you'll like this.  The funniest parts of the movie are when Ash gets beaten up or made to look like an ass.  This movie focuses more on all this c**p that happens to Ash, a clerk at a typical Wal-Mart like store while he has no idea what the hell is going on.  It's one of those movies where the main character you feel sorry for, but not for long because it's so hilarious (like in The Big Lebowski, one of my other reviews).  This is a good movie for, if you're a kid, to bring to a sleepover because there are absolutely no boring scenes, it's all just good action and comedy.  If you saw Evil Dead one or two, then this is a good conclusion to the two somewhat darker films.  Well, all I could say is that this a good movie rent and enjoy it.  Have fun!

Some people say this movie is scary, but it is absolutely not.  It's a good action flick with hilarious scenes.  If you like movies that are one part action and one part comedy, then you'll like this.  The funniest parts of the movie are when Ash gets beaten up or made to look like an ass.

Poor, poor needy little kids crying for their workaholic dad, who's simply too busy with his lawyer duties and keeping a death grip on his cell phone to pay much attention to his wifey 'n' kiddies. Yet this doesn't stop him from taking his clan out to England to visit Granny Wendy and placing the tots in such elegant nursery rooms where the old lady herself once send her Victorian childhood with her brothers. Whoops...look what happened! The kids are GONE!!! KIDNAPPED!!! MURDER!!! FIRE!!! Peter Pan's old nemesis, Capt'n Hook himself had somehow escaped the crocodile's jaws and had vowed revenge after stuffing and displaying the unfortunate beast's body in public. So lo and behold! It's time for Peter Pan to revive his very own boyhood legends so he can get his small fries back...only if he can get his old noggin out of this dense fog that had made him so middle-aged as well as preventing him from realizing his very own past - fantastic or otherwise. But first, he had to impress the Lost Boys - the very tribe he had once led AND his very own sweet-faced brats he had came so far to rescue from the mean-spirited clutches of the aging pirate captain. So let's go for a quick dip in The Fountain of Youth, boys!!!Though this sparkling little Spielberg gem may has some pretty sticky moments (the misty flashback of the boyish Peter Pan mashing lips with the young girl that had obviously resulted in such juicy babies), it nevertheless carries such a MARVELOUS wealth of whimsical eye candy, swashbuckling adventures, dreamy flights of fantasy, child-like wisdom, and really funny sight gags as well as a truly ASTONISHING range of imagination that had made just about everything possible, including such a stunning scene of THREE moons in the Neverneverland sky that really made me gasp inward! And it's also refreshing to see a grown man just enjoying himself like a kid once again (ironically, THAT'S a natural knack to ENJOY LIFE ITSELF that we have all so unfortunately lost once we reach our seething and fuming puberty!) Oh, one more thing...I think it's really cute to see our own Julie Roberts fluttering about in a fairy garb!)
