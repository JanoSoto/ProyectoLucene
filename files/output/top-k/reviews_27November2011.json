[{"date":"27 November 2011","score":"","review":" Wolfgang Petersen's film is based on real-life events of a fleet of swordfish boat crew aboard from Gloucester, Massachussets caught in a massive super-storm after drifting beyond their usual fishing grounds in an ambitious attempt to take advantage of the rich availability of swordfish in that area. Their last trip was a financial disaster so the aim is to make up for it this time round.George Clooney stars as Andrea Gail captain Billy Tyne while Mark Wahlberg co-stars as rookie Bobby Shatford while Michael Ironside supports as boat owner Bob Brown.The fantastic cast also includes Diane Lane, John C Reilly, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and William Fichtner.If you want great action sequences this is your kind of film.My criticism however is lack of depth of characters. Clooney's character isn't explored enough and apart from Wahlberg\/Lane, this can be said for most of the characters here.Bob Gunton and Karen Allen appear later on as members of a yacht caught in the storm but they aren't given much to do and much of the dialogue is pretty average and clichéd (pretty odd for a film based on a true story).In conclusion this film could have been better as with the explanation above but watching the film is a far cry away from being a waste of time. The action sequences are terrific and the suspense grabs you in thick of it. Worth a look.
