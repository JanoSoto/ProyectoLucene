I missed it's initial release and just watched it very recently, having heard of it for years and really buying into the hype, I found that there just wasn't really much to it. The main issue I have is that it is not successfully horror or comedy. The over the top and sometimes slap-stick comedy was ridiculous. There was not a single point in the film when I felt the urge to laugh out loud. As far as horror, there really wasn't much. Of course there were ghosts, put they were more or less just characters in a murder mystery. My next gripe pertains to casting. Michael J. Fox was the only person considered for the role, and for obvious reasons. He does good with the slightly self deprecating roles. The audience finds it easy to sympathize with his characters because he portrays them slightly pathetically. Also, I have issue with Dee Wallace. Peter Jackson has said that she was cast because of her overwhelming sense of innocence, especially recently coming off of E.T., unfortunately that effect is lost with the years. She is now a major player in numerous B-Horror films, roles which I identify her from more so than E.T.. It is more that E.T. was the exception and roles like Patricia Bradley are the norm. As soon as I saw her I thought to myself she is in someway responsible for all of this. Moving on from casting there are the obvious issues with the special effects. 1996 was a big year for special effects and CGI releases, but this one really missed the mark. If you look at other films released around the same time (Independence Day, Twister, Mars Attacks), although they are not perfect, they are a whole class better than the the effects from this one. CGI shadows didn't match the direction of the light source, the main threat was just a blanket of muddy CGI, and there was no real quality threshold for the ghosts, they really varied from one to another. The last and most apparent fail was the title. I get the\\at he has the ghosts that work for him (although their compensation for their services is not readily explained) and the are frighteners because he uses them to haunt potential clients. That being said, they really took backseat to all of the other story lines of the film. The title makes you expect things that the film is not going to follow through on.Although I did not care much for it and it did not meet my expectations, I was not bored while watching it, which counts for something. It was entertaining while it was on, though I doubt I would watch it again. The best thing about the film was cameo of Peter Jackson looking absolutely hilarious.

This is for sure a hallucinating, surreal, Tripp trip to the Vegas I had ever been subjected to. Yet, I could not relate all the happenings in the film, substantiate them with a story and then take this is as one film. Terry Gilliam is a fantastic director who know how to play with written work and with the camera too. But here, something coherent in writing and camera work was missing. Johnny Depp as Raoul Duke and Benecio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo have played the roles with such conviction and freedom that they seem real, natural and the best part they feel like the characters and not the actors. They have given their everything into these characters like Johnny Depp going Bald and Del Toro growing a big fat tummy. It should have been a very daunting task for them physical and psychologically to hold this film tight in grip and give away their everything. Johnny Depp we know is one of the finest actors and turns into a chameleon. But Its Del Toro who rose above the script so high that even a look into the guys of a girl, made me shiver as much as the girl shivered. Terry Gilliam made something creepy, hallucinating and even monochromatic with those red scenes sprayed for some good amount of time in the film. Yet, he did not stitch them well is what I strongly felt. Well, I agree that when under the influence of narcotics, its all random and nothing coherent or organized but when I look at the other films like Trainspotting and put this in that league, it had a big flaw. That one flaw is lack of a story. 2 guys go to Las Vegas, have fun and get back. OK, but how and what is the purpose. This is what is essentially lacking is what I felt.Having said that, it is surely one of the Tripp films and I may dare say indeed the best hallucinating films that hits the psyche when one is high. But sad part is, I was always sober when I watched it and also let me confess, this is the second time I watched. First viewing was random and I could not contemplate much, though I missed something. But in the second viewing now, I found that there is nothing much to talk or write or contemplate about this film. Having said that it is not be a film to be written off either, some may find it completely Tripp, of the cuff, brilliant and even flamboyant. Thus making it great. The music is used well, The cinematography, art direction, the costumes and the make up are just pitch perfect with the tone of the film. Even other departments like editing, casting must be appreciated. But yes, I believe it lacked Direction. A film that begins with a terrific monologue and made me delve for the first half an hour into a trip, just lost steam later and it took me places where I was not so happy to be. Having said all that, it is very difficult for me to give a rating for this. Though it did not work for me, it may work for many who appreciate many elements of this and give this away for the lack of direction. So for myself I am going with an average rating of 2\/5.

Whenever I feel low, or feel like bored, I get hold of a Wilder film and his films have each time surprised me, from Major Or Minor to One,Two,Three there is a charisma that I believe, only Wilder could bring to the film. Stalag 17 is about a prison escapade and it's not a serious drama nor a suspenseful thriller, it's a plain fun-watch. It has many moments of wit and humor, especially for the good first part. Be it Animal (Robert Strauss) flirting with Russian women, or Shapiro (Harvery Lembeck) collecting letters, they are fun filled scenes and they did not seem to be cynical or mocking at the Nazis. They seemed just plain funny. Wilder, I must say is a master writer, who knows not just only the dialog but also in which tone if it is said, brings out what emotion in an actor, and what reaction can be derived from a viewer. He deliberates acts in this film and they sync well with the script. Not for once, I felt anything was out of place, in this escape drama. Though most of the film focuses on the acts of the prisoners and how they have fun with each other day in and day out, rather than the plan of escape and all, I felt it was all right there, and it helped me engage and even empathize with their characters. Wilder, is one of the few master of the basic principle of writing, that is actions and motives make characters, a set of these characters make a plot and better their actions, better the plot. I am speaking more of the genius of Wilder I think than the film in itself. OK, the film touches all the right notes, in it's 2 hour length and fails to falter as per me. It's not a great Prisoners of War film like Bridge on the River Kwai or even Shawshank Redemption but this essentially a film where a set of people have a motive and they get their thing done. William Holden as Sergeant Sefton gives a delightful performance and there is a host of other actors who gave some wonderful performances too, like Robert Strauss as Animal The sound design seemed perfect, considering that this is a 1953 film and it had to accommodate a landscape of War. The editing was fine too, and other aspects did a great job. Of all, I am impressed with the environment that Wilder brings with each of his films, be it Lost Weekend or Some Like It Hot or even The Apartment. There is a sense of belonging such as being in that place, where the characters are, this is effectively done by right lighting and right art direction and even supreme cinematography. But Wilder has proved yet again that he was one of the most original and most acceptable voices we had who used his pen to speak more effectively than most men do. I salute his dialog, his scene writing and even his screenplay. Though the credit is shared by Edwin Blum, I suppose so that Wilder was behind the writing.I am going with 4\/5 for this. It's not the ideal nail biting stuff if such is the expectation, it's laid back fun-filled watch that mostly you will not regret watching. I am happy to have caught up with this.

However, tensions rose over creative control between Donner and the studio, so they got Richard Lester to take control over the second film (Even Lester widely regards Superman is and always will be Donner's story). Lester shot 51% of the movie, along with rewrites of Donner's work which they both worked on. Richard Lester's version was very well received, and with the release of Superman Returns in 2006 Warner Bros. released Superman 2 The Richard Donner Cut, restoring 80% of Donner's footage. The response of course was that Donner's movie has been obviously regarded as the superior film. I've yet to see it personally, but I thought I'd just bring that knowledge up to those who are fans of the series.Superman 2 is a great sequel in the Superman franchise, that in some areas succeeds over the first movie in terms of action. General Zod is portrayed by Terrance Stamp, and Stamp's performance seems to lack the emotion gravitas of what you'd think from a power hungry tyrant.

This review intends to investigate the movie itself specially story, not the actors' play nor the special effects and technical details. There are historic (real) points worth mentioning In the 1980's economy of Cuba was a TOTAL mess, resulting in increasing number of its people fleeing the country. Once fled, they were considered scum by Fidel Castro, meaning that the return road was a nasty and unwelcome one. From these refugees, a considerable number fled to Florida. In one incident, 10,000 Cubans stormed the Peruvian Embassy requesting asylum, so the U.S. agreed that it would accept 3,500 refugees. But Castro loaded boats with criminals and mentally ill and handed them to U.S. Tony Montana is one of these people and gradually climbs the tree of horror and hostility to become a full-capacity gangster. He is different from other gangsters 1) Although those refugees are from the same condition\/country, not all of them are as cruel and brave as Tony. What is his strength? His love for his sister , his fear from the past and the mindlessness caused by excessive use of heroine. In the last scene he acts like a maniac and kills some 30 armed guys. Not happening in the real world but the movie suggests that love+fear+mindlessness makes you strong enough to do miracle . 2)Is he a hero or an antihero? I believe he is none. He is something like Hamlet, an unfortunate person. That is why we are sad at the end of the film. I believe Pacino is extremely capable of playing these kind of roles as in Dog day afternoon or Serpico. I really have Al Pacino in my heart because I've seen many movies in which he is a brave underdog. In this view, the Scarface is not a blind mafia movie, It is a true tragedy with some meaning that makes it more valuable.

I don't know if any body does that in real life or even has such fantasy but David Cronenberg the director seems to be fantasised by such a fetish and made a film out of it. Extraordinary situations demand exemplary acting and thats what we have in here. Cronenberg stands all amidst directors in terms of boldness, bringing surrealism and making us believe that somethings may exist. He just makes me succumb to the believability of his themes and therein lies the greatness of Cronenberg. Now, this film is more like a fantasy fable and even the way it is presented is such. The interesting part comes when this fable seems to be a reality. Yes, paraphilia exists, yes people want to have fun in absurd and weird circumstances and this reality is married with a fable making this a really wonderful film. James Spader seems to be holding a bunch of sex driven films to his credit. Be it Sex Lies and Videotape or Secretary and is aptly cast as James Ballard. I do not think, Cronenberg might have been rejected by many other actors, to whom this role was offered. Nevertheless, Spader seemed to be in the right shoes for the role and he has done a commendable job. The film is a challenge coz it marries, the psychology of the brain to the physical desire, a dire necessity of many humans and creates a layered and textured form of a fantasy which is rare and yet so absorbing. David Cronenberg took this challenge from the novel of the same by James Ballard. To write, anyone can write anything, but to make using a publicly accessible medium in a way that it is acceptable is one thing that Cronenberg should be applauded for above all.

As a way of challenging the perfection of their crime, they host a party in their apartment and to add to the excitement and danger amongst the guests are David's father Mr Kentley (Cedric Hardwicke) and his aunt Mrs Atwater (Constance Collier). To further increase the excitement, they also invite their old school teacher Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) who they class as being a superior being and someone who may possibly suspect that something is not right once he arrives. With all these people at the party and with the perceptive Cadell in tow, will Brandon and Philip still be able to get away with their so called 'perfect crime'?In some ways, my plot summary has probably made this film sound exciting and it is, at least on paper. It starts out interesting; Brandon describes the guests that are going to be coming to the party, we have Philip who I felt had been coerced into assisting Brandon with this crime - it's clear that Brandon is in control the whole time.Like Dial M for Murder, this is another Hitchcock film that has been adapted from a stage play. Therefore, I did expect it to be dialogue heavy, but Rope wasn't just dialogue heavy, it was more like dialogue overload. It was just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.... well you get the point there. I wouldn't have minded if all the talk was relevant to the plot, but it seemed at times that the film went off at a tangent and a lot of the characters were talking about things that weren't relevant to anything. Added to this, the film also felt rather pretentious and 'artsy fartsy' and to be honest I didn't buy into this 'inferior' and 'superior' beings rubbish. I did find myself rather bored with this film at times and this is not something that you can say about most of Hitchcock's films and this is coming from someone who is a big fan of Hitchcock. With the possible exception of Brandon, Philip and Cadell the rest of the characters were quite thinly written and uninteresting (which again is not something that you can usually say about Hitchcock's films). Maybe it's just that the sight of a load of toffs at a dinner party having their pretentious conversations that just wasn't of particular interest to me.The saving grace with this film is James Stewart's character Cadell; once he appears on screen the film really goes up a gear and does start to become interesting; Cadell quickly becomes suspicious of Philip and Brandon and starts probing them for information; he's a clever man and Brandon and Philip are clearly unnerved by his presence. The best aspect of this film was towards the end where the psychological battle of wits occurs between Brandon and Cadell - I won't say anymore than that, but if you can make it past the rather dull first 60 minutes then it's well worth the wait.Another problem with this film is that it's surprisingly formulaic and also lacked any real tension or suspense - there also wasn't really any great plot twists (which is disappointing when you think how clever Dial M for murder was). I don't blame Hitchcock for the film's failings as I can see that he was only credited as the Director and once again his directing was superb. Arthur Laurents was the man responsible for the screenplay and ultimately it's here where the film fails as it's far too talky, pretentious and rather unspectacular. Then again, if it's a faithful adaptation then I can only assume that it just wasn't my cup of tea.Another saving grace with this film is with the acting; Dall was terrific as Brandon - he's cold and calculating on the inside and charming on the outside. It's clear that Milland emulated this style in Dial M for murder also to great effect. Dall was a true joy to watch. Granger was excellent as Brandon's somewhat nervous co-conspirator Philip. I thought Granger was a bit wooden in Strangers on a Train, but in this earlier effort he was much better. Stewart was as reliable as ever, but this was hardly ground breaking for him. The rest of the cast didn't really make that much of an impact, but I suppose they all did OK.If you're a fan of Hitchcock then it's probably worth checking out (if only to tick it off your list). However, for anyone else I wouldn't bother with it. It's only 82 minutes long, but it still felt like there wasn't really enough plot even to sustain the rather short running time which I can only assume is the reason that there was so much 'filler' in the middle.

I mean, for example where they gun down a whole room full of Japanese people, but not a single bullet managed to miss someone and tear a hole in the paper walls behind them.

A rarity and a great tribute to cinema itself.When love, passion and intelligence come together a genius is made and precisely Cinema Paradiso is that. Giuseppe Tornatore is a genius too. This is just his second feature film and he does an exemplary job. The nuances of a child from helping friends to learning things, growing up as juvenile and falling in love, then as a man who does his own thing. The life of a person is shown beautifully with wonderful fine moments. I love the scene in which Alfredo tells him not to trust a blue-eyed woman and how he uses a dialog from an old film is wonderful. From Keaton to Chaplin to Clark Gable to many more. There are wonderful references. The aficionados will love this as there are many montages of the good old films. The genius lies in a scene where the frame of the pass through the walls of the projection room and the film is showed on a wall of a street. Wonderful thing that and hats off to the writer director Tornatore for that.I must specially mention Ennio Morricone and his score. What music does, we all know it adds up life in a bland moment. It adds emotions, it reflects emotions, it fills silences. Ennio Moricone does it all and more he adds life to movie itself and how much ever I praise Morricone, it would be less by all means.The acting is fine be it of Alfredo, the projectionist played by Philippe Noiret, Salvatore Di Vita (child) played by Salvatore Cascio or a host of others. The boy and Alfredo have a charming chemistry which is wonderful, it gives a smile and at times there are feelings echoed my own of the way I respected my childhood teachers.A word about Giuseppe Tornatore, he really knows how to show kids and adolescents in the film. The earlier film I watched of his, Malena too had shown adolescent feelings wonderfully and here too, he knows how wonderful a kid can be and precisely depicts that with even more sensitivity. Kudos to him for that and I shall be indebted for him in many ways to have made two of my favorite films. This one and Malena.To all the film lovers, this is a must watch film and one of those that you must surely watch before I pass away. I am lucky to watch this and wish there shall be many more lucky ones. A 5\/5 for this, one of the greatest films ever.

The nuances of a child from helping friends to learning things, growing up as juvenile and falling in love, then as a man who does his own thing. The life of a person is shown beautifully with wonderful fine moments. I love the scene in which Alfredo tells him not to trust a blue-eyed woman and how he uses a dialog from an old film is wonderful. From Keaton to Chaplin to Clark Gable to many more. There are wonderful references. The aficionados will love this as there are many montages of the good old films. The genius lies in a scene where the frame of the pass through the walls of the projection room and the film is showed on a wall of a street. Wonderful thing that and hats off to the writer director Tornatore for that.I must specially mention Ennio Morricone and his score. What music does, we all know it adds up life in a bland moment. It adds emotions, it reflects emotions, it fills silences. Ennio Moricone does it all and more he adds life to movie itself and how much ever I praise Morricone, it would be less by all means.The acting is fine be it of Alfredo, the projectionist played by Philippe Noiret, Salvatore Di Vita (child) played by Salvatore Cascio or a host of others. The boy and Alfredo have a charming chemistry which is wonderful, it gives a smile and at times there are feelings echoed my own of the way I respected my childhood teachers.A word about Giuseppe Tornatore, he really knows how to show kids and adolescents in the film. The earlier film I watched of his, Malena too had shown adolescent feelings wonderfully and here too, he knows how wonderful a kid can be and precisely depicts that with even more sensitivity. Kudos to him for that and I shall be indebted for him in many ways to have made two of my favorite films. This one and Malena.To all the film lovers, this is a must watch film and one of those that you must surely watch before I pass away. I am lucky to watch this and wish there shall be many more lucky ones. A 5\/5 for this, one of the greatest films ever.

I love many shots in the film, like the conversation shots between Paulie and Henry, or the way jokes of Joe Pesci are captured or even the murders. Damn, this is all very realistic and it's admirable to have achieved it this way. Indeed at times it plays like a documentary unlike a fiction film. Also, the film is told in first person not only by Henry but also by his wife Karen. Damn, it makes the film reliable and real.The performances are superb, each detail, each nuance is done well, nothing seems out of place, a jaw dropping murder of rib tickling joke, all seem so natural in emotions here. Joe Pesci gets out some wonderful lines. Robert DeNiro is extremely cold blooded as Jimmy. Paul Sorvino as Paulie is authoritative. Loranne Bracco as Karen is loving. Ray Liotta as Henry is infectious and fragile. There is a host of other characters that are wonderful too. We must understand that these characters actually existed in reality and from their interviews was the book, Wise Gy written by Nicolas Pilleggi. GoodFellas was based on this book only. Scorsese is indeed the most interesting director of our times, who takes varied themes and puts it all in the pan and cooks it so well that the dish surely tastes delicious.To showcase power, he takes an interesting point where Henry takes his Karen into a restaurant by surpassing the crowd, going through the back door and a table is literally lifted and placed for them. To showcase guilt, Scorsese uses conversation between Jimmy and Henry. To showcase crime, he shows us just a few gunshots and how emotionless the killer is. Damn, all this makes it such interesting and a fun film. The camera movement is adept and so is the cinematographer. But to dive the camera and the cameraman, the director is needed. Scorsese precisely is such director. This is not actually a Gangster film, I will rather call it as a film that is made on Organised Crime in a throughly interesting way and with eccentric and interesting characters. Of course, the cast does get all the chords right and takes the characters into a new level.It is indeed long with a length of 140 minutes, but it's an easy film for a movie buff. But for the non-aficionados the characters names and the length may take a toll. But I will say, most film-goers have considered this a good film as per ratings all over, thus even the claim that it is lengthy can be cut off. I am giving 5\/5 for this wonderful film, that is self indulgent at times, but the best part is that it indulges you as viewer. Kudos to the master Scorsese for this.

His chase films are far superior and better than most. The 39 steps started it all way back in 1935 and his other films like North By Northwest followed it up.I saw this film way back in 1994 in DD Metro when films were played at 10 30 at Night. I revisited this film nearly 3 times again and this time, I am reviewing it now. I must confess that I love this in all aspects. An innocent accused of murder Robert Donat, running from London to Scotland and back picks up a reluctant Madeleine Carroll as his companion. The journey they undertake is a revelation. It's more suspenseful and happening than being merely called romantic. The hotel in which they stay, the happenings around. The protection offered and the escape and the ultimate truth being brought out. This forms the crux of the film. Now, all this while, there are some splashes of romances at least some nuances being thrown at and I hope you watch it for yourself to know what those are. Oh, did I mention that this is an espionage film. Now, 4 years before the World War 2, Hitchcock made this in England and thats the vision of a man. Post World War, the spies become a common phenomenon. But Hitchcock made all of these much before anyone had even got a thought and that's genius. Of course there can be few more espionage films prior to this but Hitchcock glorified the genre with this film I believe. This film came after the much successful The Man Who Knew Too Much and the climax follows a similar path. But this is probably Hitchcock's best film from his pre-Hollywood period era. There are some really wonderful editing moments like the one after the maids scream dissolves into the hissing of a train whistle. Now, see what she finds and that's really good in terms of editing and screenplay too. Now, cinematography is superb the sound editing of which Hitchcock is a master is sublime considering 1935 and from gun shot to wind everything seems to be captured well. The 39 Steps is the quintessential Hitchcock and it's worth a watch for it holds many aces up the sleeve and delivers it at the apt moments. A 4\/5 for this.

Howard Hawks who directed this was a great director who has made some fine movies, even great movies and this is a great movie.Interesting is the setup and it's a relationship between an editor and journalist, and how they converse. Now this journalist Hildy is engaged to her fiancé Bruce Baldwin (ralph Bellamy) and editor Walter wants her back. To be right, Hildy is the ex-wife of Walter. Noteworthy is the audio graph of the film, I have seen through this film that right in 1940 people were having such an overlapping tone and the conversations were so free flowing. The sound was so realistic that at times I was amazed considering that in 1940 there was such technology put into use. Hats off for this, to the makers and to Hawks specifically who got every note of the dialog pitch perfect. I am say that most of the dialog was mellifluous.Also admirable is the pace of the film, in 90 odd minutes, so much was happening in an editor's office. And each time I heard them speak, I was mostly smiling. It brings smiles to us, and that's what this very film did. Most of the time, I was happy and I love it coz it made me happy. The art direction, the cinematography just seem to be complementing the vision of the director, the expression and dialog of actor so well that I was struck to it in admiration. I so very wish that we make more such movies in Hollywood than some crap action and comedy pieces. If today's comedy is either sleazy or slapstick, this genre was called screwball comedy because a few balls of the audience were screwed by the laughter it brought out. It did not make me laugh out loud though but made so very happy. Thanks to Hawks for taking this up and making a fine film from a wonderful premise. The acting by each one is apt, in-fact the enunciation, the body language, the expression all are in sync with what is needed for the scene. And that's the hallmark of great director, who can extract some great performances. Hawks certainly did extract some memorable performances. I am going with 4\/5 for this wonderful fine gem.

Howard Hawks who directed this was a great director who has made some fine movies, even great movies and this is a great movie.Interesting is the setup and it's a relationship between an editor and journalist, and how they converse. Now this journalist Hildy is engaged to her fiancé Bruce Baldwin (ralph Bellamy) and editor Walter wants her back. To be right, Hildy is the ex-wife of Walter. Noteworthy is the audio graph of the film, I have seen through this film that right in 1940 people were having such an overlapping tone and the conversations were so free flowing. The sound was so realistic that at times I was amazed considering that in 1940 there was such technology put into use. Hats off for this, to the makers and to Hawks specifically who got every note of the dialog pitch perfect. I am say that most of the dialog was mellifluous.Also admirable is the pace of the film, in 90 odd minutes, so much was happening in an editor's office. And each time I heard them speak, I was mostly smiling. It brings smiles to us, and that's what this very film did. Most of the time, I was happy and I love it coz it made me happy. The art direction, the cinematography just seem to be complementing the vision of the director, the expression and dialog of actor so well that I was struck to it in admiration. I so very wish that we make more such movies in Hollywood than some crap action and comedy pieces. If today's comedy is either sleazy or slapstick, this genre was called screwball comedy because a few balls of the audience were screwed by the laughter it brought out. It did not make me laugh out loud though but made so very happy. Thanks to Hawks for taking this up and making a fine film from a wonderful premise. The acting by each one is apt, in-fact the enunciation, the body language, the expression all are in sync with what is needed for the scene. And that's the hallmark of great director, who can extract some great performances. Hawks certainly did extract some memorable performances. I am going with 4\/5 for this wonderful fine gem.
