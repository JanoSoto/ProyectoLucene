And the fact the plot was something impossible is why they call it science-fiction. But the concept that they can travel faster than light to me is just awesome. The effects in it are awesome. I dont complain about the gory-ness b\/c THAT is what HORROR is suppose to be. Scream and I Know What You DId Last Summer were really stupid in my opinion. Scream, it was okay, but IKWYDLS was just totally and utterly boring to me. Im glad I didnt pay movie theatre prices to see it. I would have payed to see Event Horizon, though, and I wish I would've now. The actors are great, they do a wonderful job. The cast fits perfect. A caring captain (miller), a funny guy who keeps things down to earth (cooper), the paranoid guy (smith), a weird-science freak (weir), the baby (justin), the motherly woman (peters), and the serious woman (stark).

I agree with previous comments how great the Vikings looked and how they were cast.  Just getting to know them was the best part of the movie. Banderas was used well, however i didnt like his wimpy sword and why was he such a good fighter.  It would of been nice to see him regress into a Viking and eventually learn to use the big sword.  Why is that an Actor like Mel Gibson can create classic battles in Brave Heart and McTiernan master of his domain falter with the13th warrior?  I didnt see one axe fly across the screen.  Another big mistake was making the Cannibal army too big.  Thats way too many people to battle.

I feel that it is a generation of films that'sa little more pure than what we have today.  There is a little more innocence in films like Raiders and Ghostbusters and Rambo and Back to the Future.  But I guess if you were born in the 40's you would feel the same way about films in the 50's.  It's all a matter of perspective.  But watching a film like the Goonies brings me back to a time when my summers were spent not worrying about highschool, because I wasn't even there yet.  But we spent time going to the movies, sad risking, riding our bikes and playing tag at the park.  It was a different time and a different feel.  And watching the Goonies brings me back to that time.  A time when friendship was different.  Because when you hit a certain age, you have friends, but not the same way that you did when you were twelve or thirteen.  When we were that young, we all had friends like the Goonies or like the guys in Stand By Me.  And in a way, this film reminds me of Stand By Me.  They deal with different issues but they both have friendship at the core of the film.  And that is one of the reasons that makes it so enjoyable.  The Goonies is blessed with an all star production team.  From the direction of a pre-Lethal Weapon and post Superman, we have Richard Donner.  The producers are the Amblin team of Spielberg, Kennedy and Marshall and then you have the writing of Spielberg and Columbus ( Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire ).  With a team like this, you know you are in for a good time.  But what really makes this work in front of the camera is the great young actors of the 80's.  My favourites are Corey Feldman as Mouth and of course Chunk.  Who can forget when he gets caught by the Fratelli's and he has to tell them everything.  So he proceeds to gain their liking by telling them that he has pushed his sister down the stairs and blamed the dog and then making fake puke and dumping it over the balcony at the theater.  It is a very funny sequence.  Indiana Jones' Key Huy Quan is also priceless as Data, a James bond wannabe.  The cast of young greats really makes the picture.  The adventure the Goonies goes on is great for an audiene that enjoys an Indiana Jones adventure, and seeing that would be almost everyone, there are very few people that won't enjoy this film, although to be fair I think if you are under the age of 16 you will like it that much more.I have nothing bad to say about The Goonies.  It is funny, action packed, and has a lot to say about friendship.  And if you are my age, it brings you back to a time when life wasn't so convoluted and strange.  It brings you back to a time when going on an adventure that the Goonies go on would have been fathomable for you and your friends.  So how can you not like a movie like this?
