A friend of mine had this on video and I was so desperate to own it that I bought it off him for £13 quid out of my pocket money and never looked back. I just loved it and even though I was already a fan of the series, seeing Jason get his infamous hockey mask for the first time just made me smile and just watched it over and over again.Well where do I start, for all those familiar with 1 and 2, then this one will come as no surprise and has all the right ingredients that makes this series work and viewing it again as a grown up, I do view it differently that I used to, I still love it though, even though it's not quite as perfect as I remember it. Firstly the 3D elements just too gimmicky and not used to full effect, and were just a blatant attempt for money grabbing and everything else like story and character development took a back seat. But some of the kill shots were pretty cool.The opening disco music scene which gets a lot of complaints, but personally I love it and justs adds to the cheese factor. But there a few small elements that don't work like the flashback to where Chris got attacked, just seemed muddled and not fully explored and was just thrown in to add more to the thin plot and just felt unnecessary. Then there's the dream sequence ending which just felt rushed and after some research I found out that it was just filmed because they couldn't go with the original intended downbeat ending where the survivor has her head chopped off, which would have been cool, but sadly didn't happen.But the positive aspects like I already said the iconic hockey mask was a genius touch to the proceedings and the death scenes are really cool we getting the eye popping scene which was awesome, spear gun in the eye and a guy chopped in half while doing a handstand was again brilliant. Even though the acting was quite to the level of the first 2 there were still some pretty decent performances. Larry Zerner who plays Shelly is one of the more developed and lovable characters in the franchise, Dana Kimmell plays one of the best final girls in the series, she proves more than a match for Jason, the 80's punks were hit and miss, plus the stoner characters just seemed to be there for the body count, but Richard Brooker who plays Jason definitely stands out as one of the best, bringing a hulking menacing, but human vibe to the character.All in all Friday The 13th Part 3 definitely ranks one of the best in the franchise, just don't expect any substance, it's just brainless popcorn fun with some cool killings.
