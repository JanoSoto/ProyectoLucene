Until a week ago, I thought that if I had to choose only one De Palma movie to watch for the rest of my life, it would be The Untouchables. Then I saw Scarface, and everything changed.Like The Godfather, Goodfellas and Casino (whose tag-line, No one stays at the top forever., is perfect for this film as well), Scarface showcases a criminal's slow rise to absolute power, and the events which will lead to his inevitable downfall. It's a painful, very gory journey (it's not as bloody as Carrie, also by De Palma, but quite close), and the problem is, the audience likes it. But then, who wouldn't want to get the most by doing the least? If it wasn't for the carnage that derives, it wouldn't be such a bad idea. That's the best thing with these movies they show you how cool it could be to live like a gangster, before shocking you with the downside of the whole story.But Scarface's greatness isn't all due to De Palma's direction. No, we have two other people to thank too one is Oliver Stone, who wrote the eternally quotable dialogue (You know what capitalism is? Getting f**ked!;You wanna play games? Okay.

The fact that he didn't even receive a nomination, just like the aforementioned actresses, is one of the worst crimes in cinema history.Still, that inexplicable omission by the Academy doesn't prevent Scarface from being one of the greatest movies of all time.

It's also my second most favorite horror movie of all time behind Jaws, a film I saw when I was just a wee lad.The crew of the Nostromo, a large space freighter that looks immense and incredibly scary thanks to director Ridley Scott's camera work, is awaken early from hyper sleep to investigate what seems to be a distress signal coming from a nearby planet. After a rough landing on the desolate planet, three of the crew members go out to investigate and find a large spaceship. However this is not all they find. Soon one of the crew members, who gets a little too curious, finds himself in a coma-like state with something attached to his face. He is soon brought back to the Nostromo by his shipmates, where they go about analyzing him to see what has happened. But this crew of working men and women have no clue what grisly horrors soon await them because they are no longer alone. Something dark and dangerous with no remorse for humankind will soon be stalking them one by one, and there seems to be nothing on board that is able to stop it.This movie was fantastic in every way. Ridley Scott uses mood and shadows as well as size to make the Nostromo look like the biggest, scariest haunted house ever.

It was obvious that Jean Harlow was seriously ill making this rather pedestrian film about folks at the racetrack. No serious drama of significance here, why wasn't the poor woman getting medical attention.Looking at Spencer Tracy it also is obvious he's in pretty bad shape, but he at 67 was two generations older than his co-star Jean Harlow at MGM in their salad days. And this final film of his and final screen partnership with Katharine Hepburn had a lot more of a significant message than Saratoga did. It's enobling in its own way to see how much faith Spencer Tracy had in the project.Oh, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is certainly dated now. But back in 1967 it was daring enough. Tracy and Hepburn who for the fourth time in their nine films play a husband and wife from the start, get the news that their daughter Katharine Houghton is getting married to an older man who is a widower. Oh and by the way, she's marrying Sidney Poitier who's a doctor.Getting a doctor for a son-in-law would be reason enough for celebration in most homes, but interracial marriage was still a daring topic. As Roy Glenn who is Poitier's father reminds him, he's still breaking the law in 1967 in about 17 states. The film is about how Tracy and Hepburn and Glenn and his wife Beah Richards deal with the news.Hepburn won her second Oscar for this film and she's the character on screen most of the time. Her best moment comes when she fires Virginia Christine who works for her and rushes to Hepburn's side to express concern for her.One of the things that made Spencer Tracy the great player he was, was that incredible ability he had to make the audience feel he was listening. My favorite scene of his in the film is when Beah Richards is alone with him on the porch and she compares him with her husband how the two of them have forgotten all about romance. As she speaks the two of them are profiled against the screen, Richards to the left and Tracy to the right. Though Richards is in the foreground your attention is completely on Tracy and is reactions even though we're only seeing half of his face. Stole the scene without speaking a word.I know so many people who profess liberalism in all things, but never can quite walk the walk when necessary. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is about that, putting your money where your mouth is.Watching my VHS copy of it again this evening, the scene with Glenn and Poitier brought home something else to me. Just like Poitier and Houghton were illegal back in 1967 in some parts of America, it was only until 2003 that gay people were illegal in and of themselves in several states. And even now same sex couples battle for marriage rights and equality. Maybe Guess Who's Coming to Dinner isn't quite so dated at that. And maybe Brokeback Mountain is the closest thing that gay people have to a Guess Who's Coming to Dinner right now.But can you see in a few years a man or a woman bringing home a partner of the same sex to Mom and Dad and announcing they're getting married in Massachusetts?Now that would be a great film.

After seeing the film, I can only say that such a description is a little overly optimistic, as Hollywood still had much to learn about gay male sexuality in 1998.The film centers on George Hanson (Paul Rudd), a first grade teacher who lives with his pretentious partner, Dr. Robert Joley (Timothy Daly). The film opens with George arriving late to a dinner party given by Dr. Joley's friends Constance (Allison Janney) and Sidney Miller (Alan Alda), an equally pretentious couple whose main claim to fame seems to be name dropping. Finding little in common with the other guests, George is relieved to find a kindred spirit in Constance's sister, Nina Borowski (Jennifer Aniston), who, to his delight, turns out to be his dinner partner. Delight soon turns to horror when Nina, assuming that George already knows, spills the beans that Dr. Joley is about to dump George. She does this by offering George the spare bedroom in her apartment since he will need a new place to live. When George confronts Dr. Joley and finds that this is true, he takes Nina up on her offer, as he has no place else to go. They become good friends, and enroll in a ballroom dancing class together, something Nina's boyfriend Vince (John Pankow) refuses to do. When Nina finds out that she is pregnant, she realizes that while she wants to keep the baby, she doesn't want to marry Vince. George, however, would be the perfect father. She broaches the subject with George who agrees to help her raise the baby. However, she begins to read more into his willingness to help than he means, which causes a number of complications as George moves on with his life. When George finds romance with Paul James (Amo Gulinello), who is on his way out of his relationship with Rodney Fraser (Nigel Hawthorne), Nina's jealousy threatens to destroy her friendship with George. Will she be able to reconcile the obvious disparity in their relationship? Or will they go their separate ways? It's an interesting premise, as the lines between friendship and love often do blur, even when we know we can't have someone we want. And their is much that is done well in this tale. George and Nina are both portrayed as people who we would want as friends, and their friendship with each other is a joy to watch. George's sexuality is treated in a matter of fact, and ultimately quite positive, way, and he actually does get the guy in the end. Unfortunately, while Nina's infatuation with George is perfectly believable, her stubborn insistence in pursuing him is not. She knew from the outset that he was gay. She shouldn't be surprised that he is going to try to find another man to get involved with. Yet she treats this as though it were betrayal. This makes her initial acceptance of George's sexuality disingenuous. And again, while she should know better than to try to seduce George, it's not outside the realm of possibility that she would do so. His going along with it, even for the brief time he does, is totally out of character. And it stops because a phone call interrupts it, not because he puts a stop to it. The message of this scene seemed to be that any gay man can be had by any straight woman who comes on to him. This is unforgivably weak writing, and ultimately, it was a scene that I found totally offensive. Still, for the most part, the movie is a big step forward for portrayals of gay characters on the silver screen.The acting was quite good. Rudd and Aniston play their roles with considerable charm, and you can't help liking the characters they create. Daly's smug portrayal of Joley is perfect. Pankow's confusion and anger are quite believable. Janney and Alda are wonderfully irritating. Gulinello's young gay man is nicely done. Perhaps best is Hawthorne's portrayal of the aging gay man who loses his younger partner to a younger man. He accepts his fate with grace and nobility, not an easy task, but Hawthorne pulls it off beautifully, leaving you feeling sorry for him even while you root for his lover and George to get together.There is much to commend about this charming film, and if you can overlook the inconsistencies of the writing, it can be quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, it's those consistencies which point out just how far the movie industry has to go in accurately portraying gay men in the movies.

She does this by offering George the spare bedroom in her apartment since he will need a new place to live. When George confronts Dr. Joley and finds that this is true, he takes Nina up on her offer, as he has no place else to go. They become good friends, and enroll in a ballroom dancing class together, something Nina's boyfriend Vince (John Pankow) refuses to do. When Nina finds out that she is pregnant, she realizes that while she wants to keep the baby, she doesn't want to marry Vince. George, however, would be the perfect father. She broaches the subject with George who agrees to help her raise the baby. However, she begins to read more into his willingness to help than he means, which causes a number of complications as George moves on with his life. When George finds romance with Paul James (Amo Gulinello), who is on his way out of his relationship with Rodney Fraser (Nigel Hawthorne), Nina's jealousy threatens to destroy her friendship with George. Will she be able to reconcile the obvious disparity in their relationship? Or will they go their separate ways? It's an interesting premise, as the lines between friendship and love often do blur, even when we know we can't have someone we want. And their is much that is done well in this tale. George and Nina are both portrayed as people who we would want as friends, and their friendship with each other is a joy to watch. George's sexuality is treated in a matter of fact, and ultimately quite positive, way, and he actually does get the guy in the end. Unfortunately, while Nina's infatuation with George is perfectly believable, her stubborn insistence in pursuing him is not. She knew from the outset that he was gay. She shouldn't be surprised that he is going to try to find another man to get involved with. Yet she treats this as though it were betrayal. This makes her initial acceptance of George's sexuality disingenuous. And again, while she should know better than to try to seduce George, it's not outside the realm of possibility that she would do so. His going along with it, even for the brief time he does, is totally out of character. And it stops because a phone call interrupts it, not because he puts a stop to it. The message of this scene seemed to be that any gay man can be had by any straight woman who comes on to him. This is unforgivably weak writing, and ultimately, it was a scene that I found totally offensive. Still, for the most part, the movie is a big step forward for portrayals of gay characters on the silver screen.The acting was quite good. Rudd and Aniston play their roles with considerable charm, and you can't help liking the characters they create. Daly's smug portrayal of Joley is perfect. Pankow's confusion and anger are quite believable. Janney and Alda are wonderfully irritating. Gulinello's young gay man is nicely done. Perhaps best is Hawthorne's portrayal of the aging gay man who loses his younger partner to a younger man. He accepts his fate with grace and nobility, not an easy task, but Hawthorne pulls it off beautifully, leaving you feeling sorry for him even while you root for his lover and George to get together.There is much to commend about this charming film, and if you can overlook the inconsistencies of the writing, it can be quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, it's those consistencies which point out just how far the movie industry has to go in accurately portraying gay men in the movies.

After seeing the film, I can only say that such a description is a little overly optimistic, as Hollywood still had much to learn about gay male sexuality in 1998.The film centers on George Hanson (Paul Rudd), a first grade teacher who lives with his pretentious partner, Dr. Robert Joley (Timothy Daly). The film opens with George arriving late to a dinner party given by Dr. Joley's friends Constance (Allison Janney) and Sidney Miller (Alan Alda), an equally pretentious couple whose main claim to fame seems to be name dropping. Finding little in common with the other guests, George is relieved to find a kindred spirit in Constance's sister, Nina Borowski (Jennifer Aniston), who, to his delight, turns out to be his dinner partner.

The Karate Kid, Part II doesn't really do either.I showered praise on The Karate Kid (1984) because it is undoubtedly one of the best American-made martial arts movies I've ever seen. I praised its likable, multi-dimensional characters, attention to the specifics and underlying principles of karate, and the performance of the late, great Pat Morita as the soft-spoken and whimsical Mr. Miyagi.The Karate Kid, Part II, released in 1986, is set only minutes after the final confrontation from the first film between Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio, noticeably older-looking) and Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) and is again directed by John G. Avildsen, who decides to take another stab at the underdog story.This time, the action has been shifted to Mr. Miyagi's home country of Okinawa to visit his dying father. But all is not well in this once quaint fishing village. The corporations have moved in, an American military base has been set up not far from the town's borders, and Miyagi himself is progressively pushed into a corner because of a decades-old feud with a bloodthirsty rival named Sato (Danny Kamekona).Sato has had it in for Miyagi since the two locked horns years ago over the affections of Yukie (Nobu McCarthy), a woman Sato had been arranged to marry but she instead loved Miyagi. In good faith, Miyagi left for America, never to return, while she stayed. Now that Miyagi is back, Sato takes the opportunity to settle things once and for all, even if it means certain death for one of them.Meanwhile, Daniel continues his karate training but also finds himself quickly becoming accustomed to the Okinawan way of life, immersing himself in the daily activities of the village and the culture. He finds himself at peace here, which he seemed unable to find back in California. And he is also seen growing closer to the pretty Kumiko (Tamlyn Tomita), who has dancing aspirations. But the Miyagi\/Sato conflict has spilled over onto young Daniel's shoulders too, since he is repeatedly confronted and threatened by Sato's vicious nephew Chozen (Yuji Okumoto), who easily rivals Zabka's Johnny Lawrence. Eventually, you can guess there's going to be a nasty confrontation between the two.I'm actually torn here between my feelings of this film and the first one. I know it seems cheesier and hokier, but damn it, I'm giving it a fair rating. The Karate Kid, Part II contains shades of its predecessor that are too numerous to list here, but the glossy Okinawan setting, possibly a move by screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen, doesn't completely cover up intentions to repeat the same formula in a prettier environment.On the plus side, Morita is great as always, as is Macchio as motormouth LaRusso, but I was also surprised by the lovely Tamlyn Tomita as Daniel's love interest. She is pretty, so it's easy to see why the two get together so well. And Yuji Okumoto is fairly menacing as Chozen. The action is much more sparing than it was in the first film, but the ending confrontation between Daniel and Chozen, while seemingly inappropriate, is brutal (especially for the PG rating) and as Miyagi reminds his student, he is not fighting for points but for his life.A mediocre sequel, though not a bad one. I have a feeling that The Karate Kid movies were meant to be something much greater, but instead they seemed to jump the shark with each sequel.

I thought it was going to be one of those generic military movies; I was wrong. The film really surprised me. Essentially, the film is about three Navy seamen and their journey from Virginia to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Two of the sailors are transporting the third sailor to a jail in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The two sailors in charge of transporting the third are Billy Bad Ass Buddusky (Jack Nicholson) and Mule Mulhall (Otis Young). Both men seem to be straightforward and men you would not want to mess with. The third sailor, the prisoner, is Larry Meadows (Randy Quaid). Meadows is being sent to jail for eight years because he stole forty dollars from a charity. He is a shy man who does not seem violent of malicious in any way.Buddusky and Mulhall are told that they have five days to get Meadows to Portsmouth. Buddusky and Mulhall see this assignment as a vacation. They could get Meadows to Portsmouth in two days, leaving the rest of the week for them. This changes after they meet and talk to Meadows. They realize that the kid is going to jail for unjust reasons. Throughout the early part of the movie, Meadows is stealing from the various places they visit until Buddusky and Mulhall catch him. Very early on, I got the feeling that Meadows was actually a kleptomaniac. He seems to steal on instinct without even needing whatever he steals. When Buddusky and Mulhall ask him if he had ever got in trouble with the law, Meadows says that he was caught for shoplifting, but never arrested.The two sailors take pity on the kid (first Buddusky, then, later, Mule) and decide to give him a good time before they take him to jail. They give him his first alcoholic beverage and get to know him better while staying in a hotel in Washington, D.C. Later, they make their way to Boston and buy Meadows a whore to sleep with. They even take him up to see his mother before he goes to jail, even though his mother is out. This is where we find out that Meadows' home life was no that great. He talks about his father living in Seattle and not having much to do with him. It is clear that his mother a little less than stable when they go to her house. On the day they are to take Meadows to jail, he tries to escape. Buddusky and Mulhall catch him and Buddusky, feeling hurt that Meadows would do such a thing knowing that if he escaped Buddusky and Mulhall would face consequences, hits Meadows over the head with his gun repeatedly. Not long after they take Meadows to jail, still bleeding, without saying goodbye. Although, they do not tell the commanding officer at the jail that Meadows tried to escape, which shows character on both their parts.The film was interesting because both of the established sailors seem to be ultra-masculine but both decide to pity the kid and show him a good time before he goes to jail. Even in the end, they still stand up for him when asked whether he tried to escape. You see a change in the characters. Buddusky seems to be a real bad ass, just as his moniker would reveal, but he is the one who first suggests showing Meadows a good time. Mule seems, at first, to be very intent on doing his job and he does not want to get attached to Meadows, but he soon takes a liking to Meadows and decides to go along with Buddusky. Meadows is shy at first, but he soon comes out of his shell. The ironic thing is that if Buddusky and Mulhall had not taught Meadows all of their knowledge, he probably would not have tried to escape in the end. After Buddusky and Mulhall drop Meadows off, they go back to their normal states, just as we saw them at the beginning of the film, which is very interesting.

This is an extremely brilliant film, it tops off any other Spielberg film that he has ever made, and will never be beaten by any other Spielberg film to come. It's next to impossible to make a film as brilliant as this truly moving masterpiece! The film is shot in grainy black and white to add to the effect of this film and to give the audience more of an impression that they are in the film. This is the point when a film isn't a film, this is a phenomenon that will live on throughout the centuries! This harrowing film follows a German officer named Oskar Schindler, who is very much against what the Germans are doing to all the Jews. The film follows him, who tries his hardest to save as many lives as possible. He and his assistant makes a list of as many Jews they can possibly get, and Schindler uses every last penny of his to save as many Jews as he can. The first half of the film follows Schindler who is coming to terms with the war, then as the second half begins Schindler starts to fight against the Germans who are murdering innocent Jewish civilians! Most of the detail is top of the class, with the gore non-stop and it all adds up to one emotional experience, one that is a film you must see before you die! The film may run for 3 hours, but the story is stretched out and focuses on the whole holocaust in great detail! The film seems to have next to no visual effects, Spielberg has relied on the images that he films for real, and no more of that ridiculous CGI we see too much of these days, and that is what makes it more realistic! I love this movie, this is one of the most harrowing a realistic films ever made, and Spielberg has excelled himself with such a fine masterpiece. Not even such films like 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Jurassic Park' and not even 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' can beat this film, and it will stay as one of the best films in history, unless Spielberg breaks out with another brilliant film (like his upcoming Abraham Lincoln film, or possibly Indiana Jones 4, especially after all the troubles it has gone through).

This is an extremely brilliant film, it tops off any other Spielberg film that he has ever made, and will never be beaten by any other Spielberg film to come. It's next to impossible to make a film as brilliant as this truly moving masterpiece! The film is shot in grainy black and white to add to the effect of this film and to give the audience more of an impression that they are in the film. This is the point when a film isn't a film, this is a phenomenon that will live on throughout the centuries! This harrowing film follows a German officer named Oskar Schindler, who is very much against what the Germans are doing to all the Jews. The film follows him, who tries his hardest to save as many lives as possible. He and his assistant makes a list of as many Jews they can possibly get, and Schindler uses every last penny of his to save as many Jews as he can. The first half of the film follows Schindler who is coming to terms with the war, then as the second half begins Schindler starts to fight against the Germans who are murdering innocent Jewish civilians! Most of the detail is top of the class, with the gore non-stop and it all adds up to one emotional experience, one that is a film you must see before you die! The film may run for 3 hours, but the story is stretched out and focuses on the whole holocaust in great detail! The film seems to have next to no visual effects, Spielberg has relied on the images that he films for real, and no more of that ridiculous CGI we see too much of these days, and that is what makes it more realistic! I love this movie, this is one of the most harrowing a realistic films ever made, and Spielberg has excelled himself with such a fine masterpiece. Not even such films like 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Jurassic Park' and not even 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' can beat this film, and it will stay as one of the best films in history, unless Spielberg breaks out with another brilliant film (like his upcoming Abraham Lincoln film, or possibly Indiana Jones 4, especially after all the troubles it has gone through).

Nelson is an interesting guy in his own right, having studied theology and meeting the greats of the Beat Generation before becoming a science fiction writer alongside his friend Philip K. Dick. The short story (only a few pages) was very heavily used the name Nada, the reptilians, the hidden messages, and the key component of the TV station. This is possibly John Carpenter's most under-rated movie. Unlike The Fog, Halloween or Assault on Precinct 13, which were doing just fine, this is the one most in need of a remake with updated technology and special effects. Not that any ought to be remade, but this one makes sense. But do not get me wrong, they did great with what they had.The plot drags at times (especially in the first half), and the messages get repetitive, but the underlying satire is a somewhat biting one -- though maybe not as blunt as I would like. There is an interesting interpretation of the free enterprise system, wherein aliens are using America -- and presumably the rest of Earth -- for natural resources, as though we were the Third World and to be exploited. What is interesting is if you take this to the next logical step, which the film does not.Assuming it is justifiable for us to fight off the foreign menace who are using our resources to make themselves rich while we suffer, it stands to reason that the Third World people have the right to fight off foreign invaders who exploit them for their resources and make them suffer. Which I presume is the point of this film -- causing us to think about how some people are rich and others are not. The answer is because we can turn our backs to the poor and feel no guilt.Carpenter has said this film is a response to the policies of the Reagan era. And that is undoubtedly what called Carpenter to action, but to pin this as anti-Reagan is too narrow. The film condemns consumer culture as a whole, which is not a conservative versus liberal issue. It is an American issue, or even a first world issue.But, yeah. Starring Rowdy Roddy Piper. Fighting police. And getting into the most memorable fight in movie history with Keith David... which seems like 15 minutes, but is really only 5 minutes and 20 seconds. You will wish it was longer, trust me.

This continuously runs for over two hours! That may seem overlong, but it doesn't feel it. That's because in never takes a break, well not a long one at least and because of that there's a brisk pace about it. So, you surely can't ask more. But this hybrid, comic book war flick doesn't just only go gung-ho, but it also mixes in a real jokey script that never disrupts the balance between the bouncy humour and dead serious moments. Very much, it successfully gels the two together. Actually if you've seen Three Kings (1999), you'll know what to expect, as it's very similar to that film. The humour and central idea are actually very close. Other then an economically clever script, an excellent ensemble cast help keep this from turning into an outrageous spoof. You could say it's a vehicle for the stars, even though too many stars can spoil the brew, but here it comes through with flying colours. Clint Eastwood might get top billing here, but it's his co-stars that mostly chew up the screen time. These are very much larger than life characters in this platoon full of wise guys. Eastwood gives a steely performance as Pvt. Kelly. You got Telly Savalas as MSgt. Big Joe the demanding father figure of the platoon. Don Rickles as Crapgame, who always like to speak his mind. Carroll O'Connor plays the hilarious Major General Colt and finally the most memorable of all would be Donald Sutherland's sweet talking hippie tank-man Oddball. He makes a great opening entrance and his dialog has a lasting impression! Have a little faith. Also you got the likes of Harry Dead Stanton, Gavin MacLeod and Hal Buckley. The superb chemistry between all was that of first class. What made it great was that when there was no action occurring, you got humorously great exchanges between the believable characters.Director Brian G. Hutton who also directed Eastwood in the solid Where Eagles Dare (1968) comes up with a grand scale war\/heist flick that builds up some tension in certain scenarios. These can be found in the opening sequence, and especially in the minefield scene and of course the final battle for the gold in a sleepy town. Also he provides some enterprising periods like that towards the end of the flick with the final showdown in the town square that reminisce something out of a spaghetti western. Well, it did have a western theme song playing through it. That was a nice added touch. The camera work is pretty standard, but does break the ice at times with some flair. The pounding and sometimes rattling score pretty much stuck with the standard themes like that of the drum based to trumpet playing that you hear in most war films, but it did cater for all moods. Plus the theme song may seem dated, but the buoyant tune Burning bridges by The Mike Curb Congregation does have an everlasting charm about it. Under all that haywire and spicy banter script is an anti-war slogan, but that never gets in the way of the entertainment valve. So does it hit any hurdles?

The title, incidentally, comes-from a range-of-mountains where Republican-forces were bogged-down, then-defeated; it is referred-to as the Sierra de Alcubierre. Even George Orwell was there, and he wrote a book on his experiences fighting to save Republican Spain. If Devil's Backbone says-anything, it is that these were times that showed what people then were made-of. Dr. Cásares and Carmen represent the weakened-Republic, with her leg-missing, and he being-impotent. Then, there is Jacinto, once an orphan, now a caretaker of the orphanage--a betrayer, a criminal, and a murderer. Even-worse, though, is that amidst-the-chaos of the Civil War, the orphanage is haunted by the ghost of a former child-resident who may-have been murdered. The orphanage IS Spain, with its' fascist-bomb, unexploded in-the-courtyard, a direct-reference to the bombing of the Spanish-town, Guernica. Guernica was the first-incident of the bombing-of-civilians in modern-history, and was immortalized in a painting by-Pablo Picasso The deformed-fetus in the jar is the Spain-that-never-was, still-born, unnaturally. Dr. Cásares, then, is the legacy of Spanish Republicanism, a good-legacy that literally aids the living in the finale of the film.

As the road struck into the sierra we branched off to the right and climbed a narrow mule-track that wound round the mountain-side. The hills in that part of Spain are of a queer formation, horseshoe-shaped with flattish tops and very steep sides running down into immense ravines. On the higher slopes nothing grows except stunted shrubs and heath, with the white bones of the limestone sticking out everywhere. ... - George Orwell, Homage to Catalonia, Chapter 2 It is unlikely that Mexican-director, Guillermo del Toro, will ever top this film, it is his greatest-achievement. While certainly a horror-film, it so-much-more, an allegory of the betrayals that led-to the rise-of-fascism in Spain. Most small-arms came-from Mexico, and Del Toro has said in-interviews that he lived-in a neighborhood populated by Republicans who had fled after-1939. Some have commented that the film takes-place after the fall of Republican Spain(the 1939 fall of Catalonia), but this is incorrect. The fall hasn't come-yet, and this free-fall state is the universe that the film inhabits. Taking-place in a Republican Orphanage for fallen-anarchists, Leftists, and Republican-politicians, the film is always in a state of anticipation and a kind-of limbo. All the Republican-caretakers can do is wait for the fall, and the repression that was surely-to-follow. Betrayed by the Catholic Church, the Soviet Union under-Stalin, political-infighting, and even the Western Democracies, Franco was given a blank-check to slaughter legitimate, democratic-forces by-1939. 2,000 Americans joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade to fight Franco's forces, and a United Front of Leftists and Unionists from throughout-the-world had went to Spain to fight the good-fight.

During one of her weekly Thursday shopping excursions in a neighboring town, a rather plain (though earnest and engaging), contentedly married, middle aged housewife named Laura encounters an affable and kind (also married) doctor, Alec, at the train station refreshment counter. Circumstances force a brief interaction and thus begins a series of Thursday meetings between the pair, with casual chance acquaintance quickly replaced by growing and consuming attraction.

It is Laura's tale; thus the events and emotions are related totally from her point of view, all to the romantic strains of Rachmaninof's Piano Concerto. Read all the other rave reviews about the superb acting \/ character portrayals, the atmospheric enhancement of the whizzing and hissing trains, and so on. They're all true...plot, character, setting, and atmosphere are all done to perfection in this film.

However, I'm probably one of the only viewers who regards this movie as a tribute to married love, as opposed to the middle aged affair between two ordinary people which is its obvious theme. True, the drama revolves around Laura and Alec, their encounters at the train station, their thwarted passions, and their guilt ridden emotions (especially Laura's). But, let's remember, Laura is narrating the tale as she wishes she could tell it to her husband, Fred, obviously her best friend and the only one who would understand.Well, isn't a new romance exciting, the more so if forbidden? Champagne lunches, boat excursions out in the countryside, daydreams of Paris and Venice, hanging on each other's every word. Don't we all sort of yearn for it every now and then? However, if Laura and Alec had remained together, before long they would have resembled...Laura and Fred! The Grand Romance seldom lasts, at least not in its original form; it takes on a more meaningful form. (Failure to realize this of course fills modern divorce courts.) Poor dull Fred! He's my favorite character...I absolutely adore him! He often gets a bad rap from the other reviewers. Don't buy it! Really, there's nothing wrong with him. He probably reminds many a wife of her husband, engrossed with his crossword or whatever. Steady and predictable...the most desirable quality, longterm, in a spouse!Everyone wonders why the movie shows Laura's husband but not Alec's wife, nor does it give us much information about her, other than the fact that she's delicate. That's because Brief Encounter is really the story of Laura and FRED. Even though he's not present in that many scenes, his character is well drawn.Fred may not currently be sweeping Laura off her feet but he's actually very kind to her. In the end, he realizes she's been having an affair and is grateful she's chosen him. I categorically disagree with those who claim that Laura returns to her husband only because of society's expectations, not out of love for him.What happens after the movie closes? Well, maybe Fred pays her a tiny bit more attention and, hopefully, some spark of romance might be rekindled. As for Laura, I think she'll be extremely relieved that her affair WASN'T consummated, occasionally scold herself for her brief period of insanity, realize the depth of Fred's love, and try to make it up to him for her emotional disloyalty. I doubt Laura will spend too much energy bemoaning what she might have had with Alec; the affair has made clearer to her what she DOES have with Fred.It's boring (?), stable, committed love versus brief romance and passion.

Soldiers dying all over the place, and barely 5% surviving the event! Spielberg has used perfect camera angles and just uses sound effects with no music to give it an extra touch of realism. After the events of D-Day the Americans back home discover that the there were 3 casualties in the Ryan family, and there is only one more Ryan brother left, and in hostile territory with little odds of surviving. Now a platoon that survived Omaha Beach, lead by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), who will now be sent into German territory to find Private Ryan and bring him home so he can spare his mother of loosing all her sons.

Barbara, Pvt. Cowboy, Little Joe (jumpy Stuart Margolin), Crapgame (whining Don Rickles), Big Joe (rough-hewn Telly Savalas), Pvt. Willard (Harry Dean Stanton, actually looking young - well, young-ISH), Oddball (a mind-expanded Donald Sutherland) and the unruffled, smooth operator, Kelly (Clint Eastwood, gliding through this movie like a Private With No Name), *Kelly's Heroes* invented the word ragtag. Up against these guys, American troops in previous films portrayed as impertinent insubordinates looked like altar boys.These misfits learn of a cache of 14,000 German gold bars behind enemy lines and &#150; led by Pvt. Kelly - take a detour from their futile war effort to heist it. Kinda like *The Dirty Dozen* without the meticulous planning. One down to the road block we've just begun. Two the guards are through. Three we're ALL on a spree!...Released smack in the midst of the Viet Nam war (1970), the film's coterie of quirky characters more readily reflects that era's disheveled anti-establishmentarians, rather than the somewhat grittier G.I.'s of the actual Second World War.

Cain might have written if the period had permitted it. Here is Jessica Lange, sensuously kneading dough on the baking room table and practically radiating oestrus. Here is her husband, Nick the Greek, oily, drunk, spitting his plosives all over everybody. And here is Nicholson as the reckless drifter who eases himself into Nick's confidence and forces himself into Lange's pants.The engine behind the plot is raw sex that turns to a rocky kind of love affair and then to murder and tragedy. Cain couldn't write the sex scenes in this movie, not even in Snappy Stories pulp magazines, the kind with covers showing some gorgeous doll with the shoulder of her dress ripped and a bra strap showing and some goon with a gun lurking in the shadows behind her.You can't help comparing it to the 1946 version with John Garfield, Lana Turner, and Cecil Calloway. The earlier movie is much sleeker, more compact, and brought up to date, and the characters are sketched in with greater simplicity.This one is a period picture. The time is the 1930s and the production design is just fine. They're always tooling around in cars. What cars they had in those days -- that yellow Model A convertible roadster with the rumble seat! I loved the one I once owned, even though I could never find replacement parts for it. The old days are gone forever. (Sob.) Anyway, neither Nicholson nor anyone else loves the cars as much as Nicholson winds up loving Lange, and vice versa.There is a slight problem in this bond between the two of them, namely Nick the Greek. He's a nice enough guy -- trusting, not too bright, has ties to a vibrant Greek community which we don't see much of. As a matter of fact, except for some occasional run-ins with the law, this curious trio seems to live all alone at the Twin Oaks Roadside Stand.Nicholson is required to show some range and he does a splendid job -- by turns dumb, sleazy, and horrified. Lange doesn't quite do the job that Nicholson does but she's more than adequate. When she finally gives in to Nicholson on the butcher block table she makes us believe it. The writers, though, have given her a strange and unanticipated quirk. After she's just watched Nicholson bash in her husband's head with a giant socket wrench, and she's just been severely punched in the face (twice) and knocked to the dirt among the shrubbery, she gets a case of the hots and invites Nicholson to join her in an al fresco romp. It just doesn't belong. Neither does Nicholson's brief tryst with Angelica Huston as a comic circus lion tamer. And it IS a little hard to swallow the notion that Lange is converted into a law-abiding, pregnant, willing Hausfrau because of her mother's death -- given that, until then, we didn't even know she had a mother.But those are relatively minor issues. Overall, this is a superior movie, gritty, as they say. Nicholson, unlike Garfield in 1946, looks like he really works at his job. What filthy hands. Not much can be said for his mind either. By the time he and Lange are reformed, the postman is at the door again.

Cain couldn't write the sex scenes in this movie, not even in Snappy Stories pulp magazines, the kind with covers showing some gorgeous doll with the shoulder of her dress ripped and a bra strap showing and some goon with a gun lurking in the shadows behind her.You can't help comparing it to the 1946 version with John Garfield, Lana Turner, and Cecil Calloway. The earlier movie is much sleeker, more compact, and brought up to date, and the characters are sketched in with greater simplicity.This one is a period picture. The time is the 1930s and the production design is just fine. They're always tooling around in cars. What cars they had in those days -- that yellow Model A convertible roadster with the rumble seat! I loved the one I once owned, even though I could never find replacement parts for it. The old days are gone forever. (Sob.) Anyway, neither Nicholson nor anyone else loves the cars as much as Nicholson winds up loving Lange, and vice versa.There is a slight problem in this bond between the two of them, namely Nick the Greek. He's a nice enough guy -- trusting, not too bright, has ties to a vibrant Greek community which we don't see much of. As a matter of fact, except for some occasional run-ins with the law, this curious trio seems to live all alone at the Twin Oaks Roadside Stand.Nicholson is required to show some range and he does a splendid job -- by turns dumb, sleazy, and horrified. Lange doesn't quite do the job that Nicholson does but she's more than adequate. When she finally gives in to Nicholson on the butcher block table she makes us believe it. The writers, though, have given her a strange and unanticipated quirk. After she's just watched Nicholson bash in her husband's head with a giant socket wrench, and she's just been severely punched in the face (twice) and knocked to the dirt among the shrubbery, she gets a case of the hots and invites Nicholson to join her in an al fresco romp. It just doesn't belong. Neither does Nicholson's brief tryst with Angelica Huston as a comic circus lion tamer. And it IS a little hard to swallow the notion that Lange is converted into a law-abiding, pregnant, willing Hausfrau because of her mother's death -- given that, until then, we didn't even know she had a mother.But those are relatively minor issues. Overall, this is a superior movie, gritty, as they say. Nicholson, unlike Garfield in 1946, looks like he really works at his job. What filthy hands. Not much can be said for his mind either. By the time he and Lange are reformed, the postman is at the door again.
