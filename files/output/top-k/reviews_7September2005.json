It get's off to a good start in the opening shot where Joe thinks a sexy brunette is waving to him only to find she's waving at someone else . Come on guys admit you've made the same mistake . It's also one of those romantic \/ family comedies that gets the balance right between pathos and humour without becoming jarring or unfocused . When Joe talks to Natalie his angst ridden daughter on the phone it is a touching scene helped in no small part by a musical score similar to THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION My only real complaint is that the screenplay can't keep up the momentum but that's not a unique criticism since most movies of what ever genre suffer from sagging about two thirds the way through so the only real disappointment is why didn't the producers hire Steven Seagal as Chuck the martial arts movie star .

With their previous form in mind, it came as a big surprise to me that this collaboration between King and Carpenter not only doesn't disappoint, but is actually quite good! The story is pure kitsch, and it follows a dorky young kid who falls instantly in love with a 1958 Plymouth Fury, and quickly buys it - against the better judgement of his parents and best friend. It isn't long before our hero is impressing the ladies with his new car...but Christine doesn't take well to competition. It's hard to take this sort of plot line seriously, but, for a change, Carpenter makes good of it through use of original music, the American style and some really nifty special effects. The songs used in the film create just the right mood, and help the story to cement itself in the latter half of the 1970's. The way that old 50's songs are played during the darker scenes is very eerie, and this provides the film with it's main selling point.Naturally, egomaniac John Carpenter has lavished his own trademarks on the story, and those provide much of the reason why this film can't be considered much more than 'good'. His original score isn't up to much, and just like it would do in the likes of Assault on Precinct 13 and Prince of Darkness; the score kills much of the tension. My major gripe with Carpenter is the fact that all of his films have a very dumbed down, horror for kids sort of feel; and this one does too. In that respect, aside from a few scenes - it's hard to really call this horror. When compared to modern horror directors the likes of Dario Argento et al, Carpenter just doesn't cut it. While Argento will make his films scary through his use of the camera and atmosphere - Carpenter merely films the screenplay. Like most of his oeuvre, Christine is patronising for the adult audience it is supposedly aimed at; but on the other hand, the aspects that work do outweigh Carpenter's shortfalls in the directorial talent department, and this still represents a minor success for Stephen King's list of film credits.

Halloween was and is great and this is right up there with it. You can't go wrong with Adrienne barbeau. Plus all the other actors from previous carpenter movies are in it. Even though there are a lot of goofs in it as this website points out, who cares, it is still a very scary movie. If you like john carpenter you will love this 25 year old movie of his. The way he portrays the characters and brings the ghosts to the screen is awesome. I am sure the new remake of this will be good, but it won't compare to the original.

Basically TV meteorologist Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the news story of Groundhog Day festivities in the town, with his producer Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott). The day seems pretty dull and ordinary for Phil, with some irritations along the way, but the next morning, the same 600am alarm playing Sonny and Cher's I Got You Babe repeats, as do all the events of Groundhog Day that Phil experienced. It happens again, and with all memory of his previous events, Phil is convinced he is stuck in a time loop, and for a while he takes advantage, including trying to woo Rita, which he fails at consistently. It becomes obvious he may be trapped like this, so he kills himself, but he is still alive, and tries again and again, but he still lives the same day. But with his knowledge of the same day events, Phil learns new skills and makes more friends, in order to become a saint to many people, including Rita. It is only when Rita finally agrees to stay with Phil through the night that Phil finally wakes at 600am to the next day, so your probably thinking that all along he was living the same day in order to be with Rita, a sweet thought. Also starring Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned, Brian Doyle-Murray as Buster, Marita Geraghty as Nancy, Angela Paton as Mrs. Lancaster, Scary Movie's Rick Ducommun as Gus and Rick Overton as Ralph. I can see how this could almost be a one joke comedy, but both the fantastic Murray and director Ramis do everything to keep you engaged. It won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film. It was number 34 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 13 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!

I was greatly impacted, but, as bad luck would have it, I would not see it again for two years.Mel Gibson is an accomplished actor, with films like Mad Max and Lethal Weapon under his belt. Ransom showed he was more than just a quirky role actor, but it was Braveheart that proved to everyone that he was a great actor... and director.What he has envisioned and ensnared on camera is one of the great cinematic achievements of all time, and at an awkward time, too. Looking back at previous years at the Oscars, and you have Schindler's List, Dances with Wolves, and Unforgiven. Looking ahead, you have Titanic, Shakespeare in Love, and Gladiator. These are all period pieces. Right smack dab in the middle is Braveheart. It is the most simple of the films above, yet it is arguably the best. None will argue its impact is greater than Schindler's List nor its power greater than Unforgiven, but what it has, more than any of those other films, is heart. Much like his Passion of the Christ, Mel Gibson brings a passion to this film, and that is what sustains it.Mel Gibson plays William Wallace, a well-educated Scottish peasant who is determined to lead a peaceful life. Well, if you've seen the poster for this film, you probably already know that he doesn't succeed. When a law is put into place that says English noblemen have first right to lay with Scottish brides, Wallace marries in secret. But, when it is found out, a local noble attempts to take Murron, Wallace's wife, she resists, leading to a gruesome execution. With little choice, Wallace opts for vengeance, and thus begins the journey of Scotland's greatest warrior.This is a wonderfully acted, directed, photographed, and designed film with great performances, particularly from a breathtakingly beautiful Sophie Marceau, and I recommend it wholeheartedly.
