I guess when you look at it this way, it's just good to keep the holidays with you all year round, so I said, why not let's review the 2000 family holiday movie The Family Man. The movie to me had a combination of two outstanding holiday classics like Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life and the classic Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. The Family Man stars Nicolas Cage playing off Scrooge's character named Jack Campbell, a wealthy, successful Wall Street business executive who has no care in the world for anyone or anything except for making money. But one night was a night that will change his views on the world forever. A scary looking thug named Cash (Don Cheadle) is holding up a store clerk at gunpoint over a lottery ticket and Jack tries to stop him. But this hoodlum is not some ordinary thug, he happens to be an Archangel who's mission is to evaluate Jack's self- absorbing ways in hopes to change his ways of life in order to make a better man out of him. When questioned about what Jack wants out of life, Jack replies I've got everything I need. The next morning, Jack awakens and discovers that he's no longer a bigwig corporate shrew, but a married man with two adorable kids and is now selling tires. His wife was an old college flame that he freely abandoned to go on his greedy self-centered path of success. The only way he can leave this fantasy world is if he changes his view of life and to appreciate the limited time he has in this world. The movie is a sweet, charming family-friendly holiday movie with a very easy moral message to follow and will likely keep you intrigued during it two hour plus duration. Sure the story is nothing original and the plot has been milked harder than an over-active cow, it's still grabs you and makes you appreciate the world in front of you. After all, life is too precious to be wasted upon for being greedy and selfish. It deals with such topics involving love, family values, and making life decisions whether they're good or bad. Although the story is unoriginal, it is still intriguing but the performances are also very special and the candy-coated charms makes this movie one of the more engaging holiday films that everyone of all ages could enjoy. This movie requires viewers to see with both your heart and mind in the right places. Under the direction of Brett Ratner, The Family Man is very entertaining while at the same time will likely lift one's spirits. The only main weakness was near the end where it was taking too long to wrap things up. I also expected to have a more pleasant Christmas fantasy ending, sadly The Family Man failed to deliver from that point on. But it did not dapper my spirits in any way.Performances were spot on as each actor and actress knew their roles and played them quite naturally. Nicolas Cage was quite convincing in one of his warmest performance to date as the selfish at first Jack Campbell who progressively becomes a more polar opposite to his former self by the end of the film. It's his change to become a better person is what the audience had came to see and we root for the man the whole way through. It was good to Cage in more family-friendly movie than the films we are used to seeing him in. Tea Leoni is equally poignant as the wife from his alternate world, Kate Reynolds-Campbell who's struggling financially and later reveals that she sacrificed love in college to become a very successful attorney. Leoni has the right amount of wit and charm to carry this film out along with Cage. Don Cheadle has very little screen time, but his few scenes are very effective and special. Jeremy Piven was very good here, but his screen time too is quite limited. The cast is truly amazing, but the real delightful performance comes from Mackenzie Vega as their daughter Annie Campbell. Her charm and perkiness and sweet voice makes her a scene stealer. Too bad she did not reach star quality like other child stars from that era like Dakota Fanning or Abigail Breslin. Although this movie is too long in length and the ending dragged on only to meet with unsatisfying results, there really was no ending in the final product to be honest with you. If I can overlook those flaws, I see an engaging film that's charming and is surely a nice film to add to the holiday pleasures and for the family to enjoy while it delivers a positive message we can all learn from.

What that series did expand upon a circular storyline of a film that must surely have been conceived as a one off movie with a twist ending . By the third film of the franchise the producers had moved in to themes of time travel and self fulfilling prophecies that resemble cerebral time paradox that you'd later see in the likes of THE TERMINATOR . The problem with doing this is that you're in danger tying yourself up in knots and painting yourself in to a corner . Certainly I thought CONQUEST a much more entertaining and enjoyable film than RISE which mirrors this film to a large extent but the lack of internal logic is very problematic CONQUEST is set in 1991 , almost 20 years after the film was produced and is a future where cats and dogs have died out and apes have replaced canines and felines as pets initially but have now effectively become slaves . The scenario quickly falls apart when given much thought . Is a gorilla a type of pet you'd want ? I'm guessing it's very difficult to keep even if it's toilet trained and a fruit bill alone would make keeping one prohibitive . One fact is that a chimpanzee is the most vile , violent and vicious of primate . An adult male chimp can literally tear a human being from limb to limb so there's no way anyone would want to have one in the same household . It's pointed out to the humans in the previous film that humanity will be replaced by the apes as the dominant species so what does the human race do ?  I know let's breeds millions upon millions of apes , keep them in every city on Earth where they outnumber us because they're cheap labour  I understand both greed and short termism but if anyone had any common sense this problem would be easily averted . I'm certain it'd also be impossible to condition apes in to doing relatively complex tasks but I guess you have to suspend disbelief or otherwise there would be no story This is a shame because Paul Dehn's screenplay does contain rich food for thought .

I have seen The Lord Of The Rings trilogy more times than I'd care to admit and completely fell in love with playing Skyrim on my trusty PS3. Back in the day, however, it wasn't enjoying so many riches. The genre had become stagnant and nobody took it seriously. So in many ways, I should be thankful for this early Schwarzenegger vehicle which arguably kick-started the revival in fantasy. But it is a joyless affair, full of all the violence and medieval iconography you'd expect from such a character but totally lacking any sort of humour and saddled with uneven pacing and long periods of inactivity.The future Governator plays Conan, orphaned as a young boy by marauding forces led by the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) who slay his parents and burn down his village. Taken away to live the life of a slave, the young Conan gradually becomes a vast hulk of a man and is thrown into a series of gladiatorial contests, becoming hugely successful. But after being unexpectedly freed, Conan sets off after Doom with revenge on his mind and a number of companions at his side - cunning thief Subotai (Gerry Lopez), an eccentric shaman (Mako) and Conan's lover, warrior Valeria (Sandahl Bergman).Conan The Barbarian takes a long time to tell this simplistic tale, filling every scene with surprisingly quality production values. This must have been an expensive film to make, given the lack of CG (although there are creepy, animated spirits which look just as good, given the film's age) as sets, costumes and sets all look exquisite. Sadly, the weak link in the chain is Arnold - obviously still grasping at English, I got the feeling that a lot of his dialogue had either been cut or written out given how little he actually speaks. But Conan is not a character of words, he is a man of action and it's difficult to picture anyone else in the role. Schwarzenegger's almost-cartoony physique is every bit as impressive as his acting is disappointing. Jones, given little screen time and saddled with a ridiculous wig, also isn't much of a baddie - he doesn't even have much to do during the many fight scenes because his two henchmen (Sven-Ole Thorsen and Ben Davidson) do all the work.From a production point of view, it's difficult to find fault with Conan The Barbarian. It looks and sounds good, is filled with brutal and bloody action scenes and effects that aren't as dated as you might expect. The problem is the cast let the side down and the screenplay needed much more work on it - there are long periods of time where nothing of interest happens and the ending is also a massive let-down. Personally, I also felt it a bit seedy - there is plenty of nudity in the picture and I can't really see the need for it. The characters are also underwritten and simply pop up whenever they are required, as though they were waiting there all along. It isn't as bad as other fantasy films from the Eighties - Red Sonja especially and even sequel Conan The Destroyer simply aren't as good as this. But I just wanted it to engage me, to make me care about these characters on their epic quest. Instead, I watched it impassively and fought to keep my attention on the screen.

The cast is absolutely top-notch, with Nancy Allen as Murphy's tough but caring partner, Ronny Cox as a white collar shark businessman, Miguel Ferrer as an amoral and ambitious executive, and Kurtwood Smith who steals the show as one of the most detestably amusing villains in modern movie history, Clarence Boddicker. Superb directorial touches include excellent point-of-view camera work, hilarious spoof-style in-movie commercials and news reels, and plenty of twisted dialog and comic relief. Weller's performance provides the man versus machine human story and the ED-209 prototype (although stop-motion FX seem dated), is a blast.Robocop is a solid example of a coming of age tale of brutality and bloodshed, giving audiences of the extreme action genre exactly what it came for with plenty of surprises and no-holds-barred thrills. With all the computer graphics and 3D enhancements of today, they just don't make them like this anymore, and when Robo unleashes his fury on old Detroit, you'll buy that for a dollar! The unrated Director's cut is the way to go, with the extended Murphy killing (complete with rotating camera head shot). Verhoven will go on to direct Total Recall and Basic Instinct and Peter Weller and the surviving cast will return for an entertaining sequel, Robocop 2.

There are a lot of details and flashbacks that is incorporated into the story line. The movie has a mystery\/thriller\/horror based theme and can easily be distinguished. The movie Jacob's Ladder stars Tim Robbins as Jacob and Elizabeth Pena as Jezzie. He is a Vietnam War veteran dealing with everyday life. After years of coping with the death of his child, he finds a picture of his child and that is when everything starts going downhill. After his failed marriage and the death of his young son, he finds a job at the United States Postal Office and meets a woman, Jezzie, there who helps him through his issues. Jacob starts to have hallucinations and visions of demons and a secret organization who is trying to capture him. From the hallucinations, he can't telling from what is distinguish the real or the illusions. He starts to see faceless men and with the help of his unit from Vietnam, they come to the conclusion that they are all having the same visions and believe that they were experimented on, but have no proof. His previous doctor and close friend from his unit both die in a car explosion after trying to figure out why they are having those visions. After being captured by men whom he believes is the organization that his behind the hallucinations, he fights them off and manages to jump out of the moving vehicle and is transported to what seems to be a mental hospital. When fully realizing where he is, he is tied down and is experimented on. Right before the procedure, Jezzie appears and is helping them out with the procedure. Jacob then awakens in his apartment and fights with Jezzie because he does not know if she was really lying to him or if it was just all a dream. After talking to his chiropractor Louis, the scene changes to the Vietnam War where is having a lifesaving surgery, but does not survive. The ending titles informs the viewers that drugs were being tested and used on soldiers at the time, but the government denies the accusation. I find this movie to be a lot like Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind. Both movies are really hard to understand until the very last scene and have a lot of little details that work into the movie. The lighting in the movie is dark throughout the entire movie and there is not too many scenes where there is a lot of sunlight. The only scenes where there is sunlight is his flashbacks to his memories with his ex-wife and child. This movie is a really great film if you are wanting to watch a mystery thriller with a hint of horror. It blends in all three genres really good and there are many familiar actors scene throughout the movie that brings the movie to life.

Any establishing character introductions would betray the authenticity of Oldman's searing drama. These are real people, or seem like they are, so we get to endure their mundane and often repulsive conversations as if we've known them for years. And it feels like we have. The product of their social class means they're stuck in their routines; the men indulging in coke-fuelled benders, and the women are just happy to be out of the house.Dedicated to his father, Nil by Mouth is clearly autobiographical, or at least based on Oldman's experiences growing up in a council flat in South East London. Focusing essentially on three main characters - Ray (Ray Winstone), a booze-addled, violent abuser, Valerie (Kathy Burke), his bullied and terrorised wife, and Valerie's brother Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles), a young heroin-addict relying on his mother Janet (Laila Morse) to fund his habit - the film doesn't really tell a clear-cut story, but instead immerses you in it's environment. Dialogue is fast, naturalistic and often hard to follow, and long scenes often do little other than force you to listen to these people's everyday ramblings.Anyone looking for a pleasant experience may do better to look elsewhere, as no punches are pulled. Plenty are thrown, however, as Ray's jealousy over a man he sees Valerie playing pool with - innocently - erupts into a horrific scene of domestic violence. Even more heartbreaking is the next scene, as her mother sees her daughter's battered face for the first time and must listen to her cover story, being fully aware of Ray's violence tendencies. Laila Morse (an anagram of the Italian phrase for 'my sister') is Gary Oldman's sister, and although she had no formal acting experience before the film, she may just be the best thing in it. Her expression of helplessness at the sight of her son shooting up in the back of her van is incredibly powerful.As the film goes on, we do eventually learn more about these characters. Ray may be the clear-cut monster on the surface, but there is some sympathy to be had. In a scene following a particularly self-destructive bender, Ray explains to his friend Mark (Jamie Foreman) that he had no love from his father. Beneath the bulldog exterior lies a rather pathetic and self-pitying man, unable to communicate anything to his wife to the point where they seem to exist in different rooms in their cramped flat. Not since John Cassavetes has a film so successfully portrayed the tragedy of male machismo. With Eric Clapton's wonderfully bluesy score blaring throughout, the film is drenched in atmosphere while maintaining the sense of reality. It's by no means an easy watch, but Nil by Mouth is cinema at it's most raw.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"28 July 2014","score":"","review":" When we are introduced to the various foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, poverty-stricken characters in Gary Oldman's one and only directorial credit, Nil By Mouth, they are gathered in a working club telling stories about people and events we are not privy to.

Billy Bob Thornton's lead character is one that some may almost laugh off at times with his Forrest Gump style portrayal and the build up to the end at times feels so 90's you think Arnie is going to start slapping on make up and pulling out some big guns. However the story, the feeling you have for the two main characters and their relationship is built up so well and catches you in the moment. I started watching this at 11pm on a work night and just had to watch all the way through it's 2 hour plus run time to see how it ends which some may say is a little predictable but I certainly wasn't sure.I think this is the kind of film many would attack for being unrealistic but it's uniqueness and the message that human faith in each other breaks down a lot of barriers is something that we all could learn from. Forgiveness, impartiality and innocence are huge themes throughout the movie that are dealt with in ways slightly different to the norm.Lucas Black is outstanding as Frank and his performance shines through in a role that would not be easy for a child to pull off. His pain is something many children have to go through and they don't have great role models to fall back on. Who he turns to would either be the afore mentioned unrealistic option or completely frowned upon in reality but there are good people out there who may not always be an obvious shoulder, but they are there. This is the key to this movie. Faith in others, and not always the obvious ones.Anyway it's late but I cannot recommend this movie enough. Don't start getting all OTT about it's realism, just sit back and enjoy the performances and the story. The best film I'd never heard of until I give it a go on Netflix.

Forgiveness, impartiality and innocence are huge themes throughout the movie that are dealt with in ways slightly different to the norm.Lucas Black is outstanding as Frank and his performance shines through in a role that would not be easy for a child to pull off.

Who he turns to would either be the afore mentioned unrealistic option or completely frowned upon in reality but there are good people out there who may not always be an obvious shoulder, but they are there. This is the key to this movie. Faith in others, and not always the obvious ones.Anyway it's late but I cannot recommend this movie enough.

Until now.SLing Blade is not at all what I expected as it charts a convicted killers journey upon re-entry into the world after being institutionalised from a young boy and his relationships along the way.Let me get this straight the movie has it's flaws. Billy Bob Thornton's lead character is one that some may almost laugh off at times with his Forrest Gump style portrayal and the build up to the end at times feels so 90's you think Arnie is going to start slapping on make up and pulling out some big guns.

Lester's wife Carolyn Burnham, played by actress Annette Bening, doesn't respect him, and his daughter Jane Burnham, played by actress Thora Birch, thinks her father is nobody.Lester begins falling and lusting over his daughter's friend Angela Hayes, played by actress Mena Suvari, after seeing her perform at a high school basketball game. Angela begins to flirt with Lester which only escalates the feelings he has for her. So now Lester is ready to make himself more appealing to Angela.Lester then begins to get to the point where he is fed up with his mundane, ordinary life. He begins working out to try and make himself more appealing to Angela. He also begins smoking marijuana that he purchases from his new next door neighbor and classmate of his daughter, Ricky Fits, played by actor Wes Bentley, who is also attracted to Lester's daughter Jane. Ricky's father Colonel Fits, played by actor Chris Cooper, who has a prejudice against homosexual lifestyles, begins to suspect that his son and next door neighbor Lester, is having a homosexual relationship.Then the story line gets deeper. Lester's wife, Carolyn who doesn't really respect Lester, then starts an affair with her business rival in the real estate business, Buddy Kane, played by actor Peter Gallagher. Lester was just about to get laid off, but instead he takes advantage of the efficiency expert, Brad Dupree, played by actor, Barry Del Sherman, and blackmails him for $60,000. After quitting his job, Lester takes a job at a fast food restaurant, and trades in his nice safe average Joe car, for a Pontiac Firebird.This film tells a story from Lester's' point of view, but also does a spectacular job, of bringing out the character qualities and weaknesses in each character. This film intertwines the story of all the main characters, into a great overall story and a theme that we all can relate to, or maybe even have questioned ourselves at one point in time. Are you happy with your life? Do you feel like nobody? Do you wish you could get back to the younger you and lifestyle? If you had the chance to, would you go back to your teenage years, or at least live like it? This film brings all of these questions into perspective, and does it in a way that would make you ponder these questions yourself. A must see film! This film's theme of finding yourself, resembles the movie The Wood. Where actor Taye Diggs, whose character name is Roland, is having cold feet about getting married. But, after talking and reminiscing with friends he then figures out what makes him happy, his bride to be.This film also has special effects that are not overbearing but help to relay what Lester is feeling at times. Specifically, the roses that he sees as he lusts over his daughter's friend Angela. The camera angles were also great. Overall great movie, and it lives up to its title, Beautiful.

Very few films possess all of these traits and Citizen Kane was the first one to do so. The make-up is flawless, the camera tricks are sheer genius and unrepeatable, astonishing acting, and you feel just about every kind of emotion possible. Citizen Kane has been raved as being the greatest film of all time more than any other movie. If Casablanca or The Godfather outrank it in a list, Citizen Kane is right behind them. Everybody that disagrees with this not being THE best will certainly think it was great to say the least. Citizen Kane follows the rise and fall of a controversial newspaper tycoon with reporters trying find the meaning of his dying word Rosebud. At the very end, you find out what Rosebud is and it explains nothing. Orson Welles leaves it up to you to figure out why Rosebud is so meaningful and how it is always relevant. Kane wanted people to love him and wanted various things to make himself happy. The richer he grew, the less happy he became. Rosebud symbolizes the last period of his life where he was ever truly and shows that money cannot buy happiness. Money not buying happiness is a subject that has always been talked about and will always be talked about. But Welles executes it in such a way that is sure to have a lasting impact on the viewer.

This is definitely a cult classic that should be viewed by all to see the mastery of director\/writer Kevin Smith. This is a film that was made during the hours that the Quick Mart convenience store was closed. At the time of filming Kevin Smith was actually a worker at this Quick Mart and would work during the day and film at night with little or no sleep.The story is based around the character Dante Hicks played by Brian O'Halloran and the theme is the day and life of a store clerk. Dante is called into work on a day he was suppose to be off. Throughout the day he deals with numerous problems including dealing with incompetent customers, trying to go to his hockey game, finding out that one of his ex-girlfriends have died as well as another ex-girlfriend trying to hook back up with him, all the while trying to stay with his current girlfriend. The only other characters that play a huge role in this film are Jay played by Jason Mewes and Silent Bob played by Kevin Smith. The two characters of Jay and Silent Bob hang out outside the Quick Mart and just do their own thing throughout the movie. If the scene was not revolving around Dante and Jeff it would be revolving around Jay and Silent Bob. Silent Bob only speaks once in this film and it is to give advice to Dante towards the end of the movie.This movie was shot in black and white and I believe this is what makes this film such a cult classic. Filming it this way really brought you into the mundane lives of Dante and Randal played by Jeff Anderson and what it was like to be a store clerk; Dante at Quick Mart and Randal at the video store. An idea that repeats itself through the movie is when new scenes are introduced the director cuts to new scenes by going to an all black screen with a word in white lettering. These words are used to let us the viewers know what is going to be portrayed in the next scene. You will see this done numerous times throughout the film.The only movie that I can even compare this to is Clerks II where both Dante and Randal have left their clerk jobs at the Quick Mart and video store and are now employees of a fast food chain. Both movies are about the same with Clerks II being a carbon copy of the first but in color and with new jobs.If you can get by all the cussing and all the crude humor of this film which I was able to do this film is ridiculously funny with interesting characters, the occasional unusual jokes, and witty references. A must see for all especially store clerks since they can relate to the theme of a day and life of a store clerk.

It is no wonder it has a cult following. If you are a comic book fan, even a little, this is a must see. Bruce Willis plays a superb persona, the classic role of the reluctant hero. The pull of the normal and mundane demands against the lure of his newly perceived calling. Samuel L. Jackson gives a disturbingly good performance, leaving my jaw dropped the first time I seen it, and I still get tense during certain moments, yet one can not help feel pity for his character. Two thumbs way up for M. Night Shyamalan, he proved once again he is a master of drama and suspense thrillers. Eduardo Serra shows his time was well spent at Louis Lumière College with his amazingly conducted cinematography. Solidifying the sadness of both lead roles, vivid yet dark scenes full of contrast and detail, reminiscent of the 1940's\/70's Batman and The Spectre; vigilante in a dark world. The way he captured the comic book art on film, he deserved a reward in my opinion. Finally, the music by James Newton Howard, need I say more? The man is a genius and excels with every composition, in quality and speed, a rare talent indeed. There is an overall feeling of melancholy, even in its brighter moments. The comic book references are numerous and to a fan of the sub-culture, it created even more depth to the story. This movie still leaves me pondering over the words Elijah (Mr. Glass) said If there is someone like me in the world... and I'm at one end of the spectrum... couldn't there be someone else... the opposite of me at the other end? -roughly 3018 into the film.

If you are a comic book fan, even a little, this is a must see. Bruce Willis plays a superb persona, the classic role of the reluctant hero. The pull of the normal and mundane demands against the lure of his newly perceived calling. Samuel L. Jackson gives a disturbingly good performance, leaving my jaw dropped the first time I seen it, and I still get tense during certain moments, yet one can not help feel pity for his character. Two thumbs way up for M. Night Shyamalan, he proved once again he is a master of drama and suspense thrillers. Eduardo Serra shows his time was well spent at Louis Lumière College with his amazingly conducted cinematography. Solidifying the sadness of both lead roles, vivid yet dark scenes full of contrast and detail, reminiscent of the 1940's\/70's Batman and The Spectre; vigilante in a dark world. The way he captured the comic book art on film, he deserved a reward in my opinion. Finally, the music by James Newton Howard, need I say more? The man is a genius and excels with every composition, in quality and speed, a rare talent indeed. There is an overall feeling of melancholy, even in its brighter moments. The comic book references are numerous and to a fan of the sub-culture, it created even more depth to the story.
