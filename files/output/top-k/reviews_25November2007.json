Now there were plenty in the 40s and 50s especially with the likes of Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity, Sunset Blvd. etc.. and Alfred Hitchcock's many unforgettable thrillers like Vertigo, Strangers on a Train, Shadow of a Doubt, Dial M for Murder, North by Northwest, Notorious, Rebecca, etc.. However once the 1960s came along there weren't quiet as many film noir type dramas as in the previous two decades. Now I'm not forgetting the film that started the 60's off with a bang Psycho.. and I am very aware of all( and I do mean all) of the great dramas of the 60's but Cape Fear still stands out as one of the best of its time.To begin Greg Peck who was producing at the time came up with a great title\/name change and the novel The Executioners became the film Cape Fear. Peck while working on the Guns of Navarone took a liking to J. Lee Thompson's direction and asked him to direct Cape Fear. From that point on the team just got better and better. Here comes Team Hitchcock.... Bernard Herman who had scored more than a half dozen Hitchcock films was on board for the score. Next an art direction great and collaborator of Hitchcock Bob Boyle was hired. Then one of the best editors in film history, and once again a friend and collaborator of Hitchcock, George Tomasini was going to be the editor of Cape Fear. What a team! Now there are many other connections to Hitchcock through this film. For instance J. Lee Thompson had worked as an assistant on a film with Hitchcock many years ago(pre Rebecca). Also Thomas Tuttle who was the make-up artist on Cape Fear was the brother of one of Hitchcocks main make-up men William Tuttle. There were also actors like Martin Balsam that had worked for Hitchcock before(Psycho). So anyway all of these connections are probably part of the reason this film screams This is an Alfred Hitchcock film.I am not going to go very far into the plot other than to mention its a great story. Greg Peck plays a very believable lawyer in a small southern town who has testified 8 or so yrs earlier against Mitchum (Cady). This Max Cady (Mitchum) never forgot and is now out of prison and ready to exact all of the pain and years of suffering on Peck and his family. Let the thrills begin in this Hitchcockian style Drama. As Max Cady begins his evil game of cat and mouse we find out when he is picked up by the local police that he has been studying the very law that put him behind bars and is more than prepared for his frightening hunt.

In Bottle Rocket three best friends, all grown men living in a middle class suburb, find meaning in their lives by being thieves. It's not clear why they want to steal but they never bother to go legit. What we have instead of a plot driven narrative is a character study about men who still think they're thirteen years old. Don't take this the wrong way, I enjoyed the film for the most part but it clearly is a directorial debut for Wes Anderson as the film structure is very rough. Within the film you can kind of make out his style that we know he will ultimately improve in his other films but what I find interesting is that theme I mentioned.In Rushmore, although the protagonist is in High School, it's easy to see the immaturity of the adults that surround him (and what will become of him in adulthood?). In The Royal Tannenbaum's the adults of the family are dysfunctional because of the way they were raised so the character's have to come up with what they believe how grown ups are supposed to act. In The Darjeeling Limited the main characters act very much like they most likely did as children, with one character upset at the responsibilities of becoming a father.I remember when MTV had done a quick featurette on this film, shortly before it was released, it contained a quick interview with the Owen brothers detailing Cahn's dismay with not being able to get an answer as to why the film was called Bottle Rocket. The brothers got a kick out of it and it's no surprise that their sense humor in the interview is very much like the one displayed in the movie. Regardless, the film had piqued my interest but for whatever reason I didn't see it. Since then I have seen every Wes Anderson film, including The Darjeeling Limited and it wasn't until after seeing his last film that I decided to back-track and see this. In other words I did not witness his evolution as a film maker in any linear sense but now it's clear what he's been trying to do and say with his characters and I'm not sure I would have noticed it had I not seen his films in this order.Put it this way, because of his other films, I was able to appreciate Bottle Rocket and if you are a fan of his and have not seen it then you should do so as I think you'll like it.

It turns out that MCloud is in for a rough time with both a major hurricane brewing and about the hit the Keys as well as big time gangster Johnny Rocco, Edward G. Robinson, planning to make his way back to the states, via Cuba. This after eight years in exile in Italy after Rocco was drummed out of the country as an undesirable alien.Besides wanting to go out in the Caribbean to catch fish McCloud is eager to meet the Largo Hotel's owner and his daughter in law James & Norma Temple, Lionel Barrymore & Lauren Bacall,who's son and Nora's husband, George Temple, McCloud was with when he was killed in action at Mount Casino back in 1944. At the hotel there's Rocco's gang waiting for the big man himself to finally make his grand appearance and jump start, after eight of inactivity, his criminal career. Rocco is planning to ship a load of counterfeit money ,round robin, from Key Largo to Havana and then back to the USA with his gangster friend Ziggy, Marc Lawrence,bank rolling the deal.With everything planned to perfection by Rocco and his hoods things get a bit strained when the hurricane hits the Keys and then blows, or was it that the skipper chickened out and took off, their getaway boat to Cuba out to sea. With just a few hours left to get out of the state, as well as country, before the cops and feds get wind of what's going on at the Largo Hotel Rocco has McCloud take him and his boys on his fishing boat to Cuba planning to knock him off before they makes port. McCloud who's on to Rocco and what he plans for him turns the tables on the arrogant hoodlum by getting his men, lead by Richard Curly Huff (Thomas Gomez), to drop their guard. After offing all three of Rocco's hoods, Curly Angel & Toots, McCloud then has a showdown on the high seas with Rocco who has to do something that he's not at all that used to; whack someone, who's both armed and dangerous, by himself without his hoods there to protect him.Even though he didn't show up on the screen until almost an half hour into the movie Edward G. Robinson is by far more effective as the deported Mafia Chieftain Johnny Rocco then his co-star the, for once in a gangster movie, All-Amerca good guy Humphrey Bogart as Soldier McCloud. There's also in Key Largo the woozy girlfriend of Johnny Rocco ex-showgirl and singer Gaye Dawn, Claire Trevor, whom he mercilessly and sadistically tortures by keeping her away from the hotel's bar and liquor cabinet. The movie takes place within the space of a 24 hour period with the real star in it the hurricane that hits the Keys and prevents Rocco and his hoods from making good their getaway. The Rocco Mob plans to reestablishing a newer and better, as well as more effective, mob that will uses it's both power and influence to have probation again enacted and put on the books. With probation back in business it will put the mob back in the money by it pushing cheap cut and and water down booze to the, by then , bone dry American public and make millions, like in the 1920's and 1930's, off it. What happened instead is that after the war it was drugs like heroin and cocaine that took the place of bootleg booze which was not only deadlier but far more profitable for the mob. Rocco in a way did get it right with his idea of using Cuba as a hub for his criminal operations in the states. In just four more years, in 1952, Sgt. Batista took over the country as Cuba's dictator and worked together with the Mob, or Mafia, as his partners in establishing Cuba as the only country that let it run it's illegal operations up front and in public with him and his boys getting a piece of the action. It's just too bad that in the end that great seer and visionary Johnny Rocco never lived to see that great event in Mafia history ever happen.

After breaking down inside a tunnel, the two make their way to a busy truck stop in the French countryside, and Saskia goes inside to grab a few things. But when she fails to return to the car, panic ensues, and Rex begins a frantic search for his missing girlfriend. Three years later, Saskia is still missing, and the abductor, Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), a cool-facaded college professor, begins contacting Rex, promising to tell him the truth of what he did to Saskia... but Rex, desperate for answers, finds himself in a situation more horrifying than he could have ever imagined.I'd heard of The Vanishing before, and how it was hailed as a psychological chiller classic, but I had no idea that the version that I was aware of was actually a remake of a 1980s French\/Dutch film. That is, until I mistook this movie for the 1993 American version at the video store. When I took it home and began watching, I immediately realized this was the original French film, but I'm extremely happy that I made this mistake. Why? Because otherwise I wouldn't have gotten to watch this excellent movie. I have yet to see the American remake of the film, so I cannot compare the two, but I can easily say that I found this to be one of the most effective psychological horror films I've had the pleasure of seeing.Truly worthy of the Hitchcockian label, The Vanishing weaves a tale that is both frightening and dramatic. When the film begins, it gets off slowly. Nothing much happens for a good thirty minutes, but we, the audience, already know something bad is coming in the way of our characters. And when that moment happens, it's scary because of how realistically depicted it is. Everything in this film is realistic, and I think that gives it a lot of power. The characters, their actions, their rationale - it all seems so human, and it is easy to sympathize with them. After Saskia has vanished, the rest of the film focuses on both Rex and Raymond, and the mind games that Raymond begins with Rex, who is desperately seeking the truth. The themes in this film are relate-able as well - the loss of a loved one and the desperate need to find the truth behind what happened to them. All of this is natural human reaction, but the situation in which it's placed is unusually and sufficiently frightening.The imagery in the film is lyrical, the camera-work excellent, and the symbolism effective. It's an atmospheric movie and this is another one of its large benefactors. It leaves its audience in a surreal, somewhat depressed state, and a film that can do that has got to have achieved something worthy of recognition. The acting is great, Donnadieu plays a role reminiscent of Rutger Hauer's performance in The Hitcher, and Bervoets is convincing as the Rex character, desperate in finding answers. Johanna ter Steege is also great as Rex's ill-fated girlfriend, Saskia. As for the much-talked-about-ending, all I can say is Wow. I didn't see it coming, and it isn't anything remotely like your typical story conclusion. It, as well as the rest of the film, is depressing, dark, and somber, and while I wouldn't call it a twist (because it really isn't), it's still extremely effective.Overall, Spoorloos, or The Vanishing is a surreal and scary film. The story is near genius and worthy of a Hitchcock status, and the movie is extremely well-made. For fans of slow-going, almost dreamlike psychological horror films, The Vanishing is an absolute must-see. It leaves you with a strange, unsettling feeling in the pit of your stomach, and poses a thought provoking question- how far would you go to discover the truth? Perhaps sometimes the truth is better left unknown. I can't stress enough that filmgoers should not be put off by foreign-language movies. If you're too lazy to handle subtitles, then you will miss out on excellent films like this and many, many others. 9\/10.

How can you go wrong? Meg Tilly, unglamorized, is a naive teen-aged graduate of a Catholic school. She makes her other-worldly way back to her REALLY dysfunctional, rambling mansion in Easthampton, where her villainous stepfather (John Glover, hammy but great!) is staggering around, usually three sheets to the wind, and entertaining his girl friend, Dana Delaney (Miss Briscoe, Lenny's sister-in-law). The script has given Tilly's mother the deep six before the movie starts.Also present, the multi-talented Rob Lowe who, were he any worse an actor, could sink this vessel faster than a horde of mutant torpedo worms. As it is, he's a superb captain, as someone calls him. His job seems to be skippering the racing sloops of very rich people so skillfully that they beat the racing sloops of other very rich people.Lowe has assignations with the slutty Kim Cattrall, somebody else's wife. Very racy dialog. Lowe gives Cattrall a birthday present, a pair of skimpy black panties. Cattrall You want me to wear these? Lowe I can't bite them off you if you don't. Avast there. Here comes a spoiler that may take the wind out of your sails. Lowe is not what he seems. Actually, he's in cahoots with Tilly's step-father and the town cop. The three of them decide that Meg Tilly's several hundreds of millions of dollars is too burdensome for one young woman, so they are going to have Lowe seduce her, marry her, and eliminate her -- in that order -- so that they can split up her assets three ways.The plan goes awry. Lowe begins to feel affectionate towards Tilly, especially after they are as married as matched pelican hooks and she becomes pregnant. He shoots and kills Glover. Dana Delaney, Glover's squeeze, gets suspicious and is found hanging by a belt. The corrupt cop notices these little incidents and tries to blow up Tilly by tinkering with the gas line aboard her sloop, the Obsession. In a frantic attempt to save Tilly, Lowe is hoist by the cop's petard. In the cop's office, Tilly comes to grasp nature of the plan by an act of spiritually inspired intuition, just from glimpsing a photo of the three conspirators pinned to the cop's wall. (An old snapshot of three smiling men holding up a fish, and she twigs.) The cop attacks her with a lug wrench or a marlinspike or something and tries to stove in her head. And he's a big, burly guy too. But those nuns turn out tough little babes and he can't do more than rip her shirt a bit before she propels him through the window to his death below.John Williams' lush score practically swoons at the end as Tilly stands bravely alone, knowing that Lowe, though now in Davey Jones' locker, REALLY loved her. This ending prompts a question, though. She now has all those millions and that huge beachfront mansion to herself now, doesn't she? So what is her phone number? Not much acting is really required in a piece like this. But John Glover is sublime as the villain. He always is. Rob Lowe, blandly handsome, like a department store mannequin, should be relieved of his watch and sent below. Meg Tilly is more complicated. She has a voice that's at once diminutive and husky. She seems to have been given a minimum of makeup, so her blemishes and pimples show on her pale face and shoulders. And that haircut! Blackbeard the Pirate looked more glamorous, even with the smoking gunpowder fuzes tied in his tresses. I suppose many eyes seem to tilt from inner canthus upward, but Tilly's are alarming. Kim Cattrall is a snoot but has some of the best lines. While you were plugging your stepfather, your husband was plugging me -- and he was great! Well, it's not really a dirty movie though. Two scenes of Cattrall topless and one of simulated sex between Lowe and Tilly. Oh, and a shot of Lowe's buns, which reminded me that on a ship you should always spit to leeward.There's another thing. I don't know if I should bother mentioning it because I'm not sure it's there, although there's a place for it in the plot. Still, I want to stay in the channel here. Red, right, returning, y'know. There's a bit of a homoerotic element in the relationship between Lowe and the conspiratorial cop. Lowe visits the cop at home. The cop is in bed and gets out to have a serious engagement with Lowe. He's all muscles, his head included, and he's wearing only a pair of skivvies, and when he threatens Lowe, he thrusts his face almost against Lowe's, takes Lowe's cheeks and squeezes them together so that Lowe's lips are pursed, and I'm thinking two more inches and this is a gay scene.This romantic thriller isn't for everyone's tastes, I would guess, but I kind of enjoyed it, partly because I like the Hamptons and spent a lot of summers there as a youth. Well -- Sag Harbor, actually, in the modest house of some friends, acquired years before the area became uninhabitable for anyone except cosmetic surgeons, when the community was so compact and unprepossesing that, in a sandy wood just past the edge of town, you could sit and watch the foxes stare back at you, sometimes scratching their pointed black ears with their tiny and precise black paws.

Meg Tilly, unglamorized, is a naive teen-aged graduate of a Catholic school. She makes her other-worldly way back to her REALLY dysfunctional, rambling mansion in Easthampton, where her villainous stepfather (John Glover, hammy but great!) is staggering around, usually three sheets to the wind, and entertaining his girl friend, Dana Delaney (Miss Briscoe, Lenny's sister-in-law). The script has given Tilly's mother the deep six before the movie starts.Also present, the multi-talented Rob Lowe who, were he any worse an actor, could sink this vessel faster than a horde of mutant torpedo worms. As it is, he's a superb captain, as someone calls him. His job seems to be skippering the racing sloops of very rich people so skillfully that they beat the racing sloops of other very rich people.Lowe has assignations with the slutty Kim Cattrall, somebody else's wife. Very racy dialog. Lowe gives Cattrall a birthday present, a pair of skimpy black panties. Cattrall You want me to wear these? Lowe I can't bite them off you if you don't. Avast there. Here comes a spoiler that may take the wind out of your sails. Lowe is not what he seems. Actually, he's in cahoots with Tilly's step-father and the town cop. The three of them decide that Meg Tilly's several hundreds of millions of dollars is too burdensome for one young woman, so they are going to have Lowe seduce her, marry her, and eliminate her -- in that order -- so that they can split up her assets three ways.The plan goes awry. Lowe begins to feel affectionate towards Tilly, especially after they are as married as matched pelican hooks and she becomes pregnant. He shoots and kills Glover. Dana Delaney, Glover's squeeze, gets suspicious and is found hanging by a belt. The corrupt cop notices these little incidents and tries to blow up Tilly by tinkering with the gas line aboard her sloop, the Obsession. In a frantic attempt to save Tilly, Lowe is hoist by the cop's petard. In the cop's office, Tilly comes to grasp nature of the plan by an act of spiritually inspired intuition, just from glimpsing a photo of the three conspirators pinned to the cop's wall. (An old snapshot of three smiling men holding up a fish, and she twigs.) The cop attacks her with a lug wrench or a marlinspike or something and tries to stove in her head.

But Guy is having trouble finding work as an actor. Once his luck improves, Rosemary is pregnant and her pregnancy becomes more and more unbearable and her neighbors even more and more strange and intruding. What is going on in this apartment? I want to say Mia Farrow was pretty hot in this movie. I don't know why. I mean, she's really not all that hot, and for a good part of the movie she has very short hair which is generally very unattractive on women. Even Guy tells Rosemary that her haircut is the biggest mistake she ever made (and I'm inclined to agree). Yet, you got me Mia... well played.I'm also concerned about the film's anti-Semitism. I've never heard anyone accuse the film of anti-Semitism before, but it seemed possible to me. The satanic doctor had a Jewish-sounding name and the satanic neighbor lady had a very stereotypical Jewish manner about her. Now, it's never stated anyone is Jewish, but it seems to me like that is what Polanski was hinting at. Which is very odd, having Jews be running a Satanic cult to harm Catholic women. I mean, having a cult is one thing, but a Jewish devil-worshiping cult seems like a bad idea.Anyway, this film is of course very good. It's now roughly forty years old and still a classic by both horror and general cinema standards. And I'm not going to say the people who have judged it so are wrong. It really broke ground in some ways. A rape scene involving Satan? You don't see that a lot in movies, at least not in movies that many mainstream people watch. Which is perhaps too bad. I like a good bit of devil rape every now and then.But yeah, the plot is good, the acting good (Rosemary comes off as really naive and far too submissive, but it was the 1960s so I guess that happens). The suspense was very nice, and although the audience is usually two steps ahead of Rosemary in figuring things out, it's nice to see her come across the twists and turns -- is she going mad or is there really something dark lurking under every cradle? Watch this film, if for no other reason than to see D'Urville Martin (Dolemite) or hear the voice of Tony Curtis. Or wonder why Mia Farrow can maintain a hotness with short hair. There's no real nudity, no real gore (in fact, none). But this is classic story-telling at its finest. I watched it again in honor of writer Ira Levin's passing, but you don't need a special occasion to enjoy this one.
