Zombi 2 is a great little picture with a decent plot, this one is just plain nutz. It has bad editing, bad camera work, bad acting and the plot has more holes than a piece of swiss cheese, but i still found it quite charming and i would have to recommend it to hard core zombie horror fans. When i was a teenager i watched the old UK edit of this movie and remember thinking it was bad, but then i was zombie hungry. Unfortunately this only goes zombie crazy near the end, and in a cut form it doesn't seem worth the wait. In it's uncut form, yes, it is. It's all about the cutting, cut 70\/80s horrors build up the tension (often badly) and then the scene fizzles out. Uncut versions build up the same and then... YUK!! It often doesn't matter if the effects are poor, they're often simply worth the wait, like a few in this movie.

However when it comes to the sequel for &#145;one of the biggest films of the 1980's', that being Ghostbusters II, the fuss was not so big and the talk was not so loud, about it being good or bad. Although it was made a while ago, Ghostbusters II has many nostalgic moments, which makes me wonder why it is was not a hit. When Venkman says &#145;Sometimes, weird things happen, someone has to deal with it, and who are you gonna call?!', you know it is time once again to call on the &#145;Ghostbusters'.Five years after waging a war on slime that cost New York City millions, the Ghostbusters find themselves out of business--until an ancient tyrant, preparing a return to the Earthly domain through a river of slime under the city and his portrait at the Manhattan Museum of Art, sets his sights on Dana Barrett's baby as the new home for his wicked soul! With the help of the Museum's possessed curator, he plans to turn New York into a really scary place to live! Now only the Ghostbusters can save New York City, by turning paranormal pest control into an art form!The surprising part about this film is that almost every aspect from the first, returned to do it all a second time. Director Ivan Reitman does a grand job in directing Ghostbusters II. I am certain that he wanted to make this film as similar to the first Ghostbusters as he could, considering that formula seemed to be very popular with many movie fans. The screenplay was once again written by two of the stars of the movie, that being Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis. They certainly put a lot of thought into the humour being presented, which made this film seem very original and funny. If either of these areas of Ghostbusters II were a failure, than I am sure that this film would not have been anywhere near as good, as I thought it was.I was glad to see all the cast back for a second time. The way we see the Ghostbusters five years on is very amusing. With two of them doing parties and being a joke, one doing a TV talk show and the other being a psychologist. Bill Murray still added that funny touch to the movie, with his character of Venkman being outrageous, which made the movie funny to watch. All the other Ghostbusters characters were good once again. Stantz, Spengler and Zeddemore are as they were before, smart or as silly as ever. Breaking up this team would for me seem an injustice.The supporting cast was also good. Dana Barrett was performed well again by Sigourney Weaver. Dana is a woman whose life always seems to be troubled by paranormal pests and a man by the name of Venkman. Joining the cast is &#145;Ally MacBeals' Peter MacNichol, who is the zany character of Janosz Poha, Dana Barrett's possessed art boss. I also found it clever to have the characters of Janine (Annie Potts) and Louis (Rick Moranis) return as lovers, as this adds a bit of spice and variety to the story. Furthermore, Dana's baby Oscar was a cutie, and by the end of the movie was an integral character to the makeup of the story. Add in the return of Slimer, which although he was not as funny as I had hoped he would be, put a smile on my face every time I saw him.  There are some very funny scenes and lines in Ghostbusters II. I like how the movie starts, with Dana's baby carriage just taking off by itself. Then you also have the funny courtroom scene, where the Ghostbusters are charged as guilty of their crime, then in the next instant are tackling ghost in the courtroom, by the judge's requests! At the end of this scene the guys remark &#145;Two in the box, ready to go, we be fast and they be slow'. Yet when we see a river of slime under the city, which can cause people to turn evil, you know that the fun has returned again.

I am surprised if it wasn't, as it was everything that you could want from a sequel, and that little bit more. Although it was not as good as the original, I still had a fun time watching the Ghostbusters a second time around and is must-see for fans.

It is a pulp comic book, serial adventure, sci-fi, action-comedy movie with a dose of romance thrown in. John Lithgow's over the top performance as Doctor Lizardo and Peter Weller's superb job as Buckaroo along with the comic relief of Jeff Goldblum and scene stealing steamy innocence of Ellen Barkin help make this a true classic and one of my favorite movies of all time. The closest movie I can compare it to is another one of my favorites, Big Trouble in Little China.For those who have not seen the movie, Buckaroo Banzai is a world famous Neurosurgeon, rock star, comic book character, rocket car driver and scientist. He also has his own organization of boy-scout like groups called Blue Blazers. His band, The Hong Kong Cavaliers, are a group of top scientists and all around good guys with very distinct personalities. Penny Pretty is the love interest of Buckaroo, who also happens to be his deceased wife's long lost twin sister. There is so much going on in this movie that I probably saw it three times before I totally understood the whole story. Which in a nutshell is Black Lectoids = good. Red Lectoids = bad. Dr. Lizardo is a Red Lectoid. The Black Lectoids have discovered that arch criminal Dr. Lizardo is on the loose on planet Earth and they threaten to wipe out the entire planet to make sure that he does not escape. They give Buckaroo 24 hours to capture or kill him before they put their annihilation plan into place. With his band and a few others, Buckaroo infiltrates the hideout of Dr. Lizardo and manage to set things right. I really could go on for pages on details on the story and the plot, but you wouldn't believe me. There is no way anyone could have gotten so much into a 102 minute movie. And do you know what the most frustrating part is? At the end they display to be on the lookout for Buckaroo Banzai and the World Crime Syndicate.

There is another segment titled Buckaroo Banzai Declassified Documentary which is from the viewpoint that he is a real person.

His directorial debut, Cronos, is a hugely original movie and take on the vampire theme. Guillermo also wrote the screenplay.The movie opens up with a narrator telling the story of an alchemist who made a metallic, beetle like device (the Cronos) that when placed against skin, has a scorpion like stinger that stabs the person and injects a tiny amount of bloody fluid. The injections cause the alchemist to live for centuries and only dies when he is in line at a bank in Vera Cruz during an earthquake and is crushed by falling debris.Some time later, an antique dealer, Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi), discovers the Cronos device in the base of an old statue he has acquired. After wondering what the device might be for, he inadvertently sets it off and is pricked by it's stinger. The whole process of watching this happen is fascinating, and you are never quite sure if there is some sort of living insect inside the enclosure, thanks to Guillermo's David Lynch like photography and editing of the scene.Jesus soon discovers that he has more energy and feels more youthful than he has in ages. But unbeknownst to him, there is an evil and rich old man, Dieter de la Guardia (Claudio Brook) who has been searching for years for the device. He has tracked it down to Jesus' shop and sends his simple minded nephew, Angel de la Guardia (brilliantly portrayed by Ron Perlman), to get the statue that has stored in it, the Cronos device. When the statue turns up empty, Dieter instructs Angel to get the device at any cost.In the meantime, Jesus has become addicted to using the device. His young granddaughter has noticed him using it and decides for his own good to hide it from him. After spending time with her he realizes that maybe the sacrifices of the device, such as his wife not feeling as youthful as him, or his greedy and manic need to possess and have control of the device, are not worth the benefits.The story is not fast paced by any means, but the development of the characters is superb. There are also slow moving scenes with huge amounts of tension, in particular a scene where Jesus is at a party where someone had cut himself and cleaned up in the bathroom. Jesus finds himself drawn to the blood that had dripped on the floor and after slowly considering it and getting his face closer to it, he has his cheek against the floor and extends his tongue and licks up the drops!I have seen the video a couple times, but it is on DVD in region 2 PAL format only. The video is available in both subtitled and dubbed versions. I highly recommend the version with subtitles, because much of the dialogue is already in English. Ron Perlman's character for example speaks very little Spanish.Perhaps now that Guillermo del Toro is more well known in the US, we will get a region 1 NTSC release on dvd.

His directorial debut, Cronos, is a hugely original movie and take on the vampire theme. Guillermo also wrote the screenplay.The movie opens up with a narrator telling the story of an alchemist who made a metallic, beetle like device (the Cronos) that when placed against skin, has a scorpion like stinger that stabs the person and injects a tiny amount of bloody fluid. The injections cause the alchemist to live for centuries and only dies when he is in line at a bank in Vera Cruz during an earthquake and is crushed by falling debris.Some time later, an antique dealer, Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi), discovers the Cronos device in the base of an old statue he has acquired. After wondering what the device might be for, he inadvertently sets it off and is pricked by it's stinger. The whole process of watching this happen is fascinating, and you are never quite sure if there is some sort of living insect inside the enclosure, thanks to Guillermo's David Lynch like photography and editing of the scene.Jesus soon discovers that he has more energy and feels more youthful than he has in ages. But unbeknownst to him, there is an evil and rich old man, Dieter de la Guardia (Claudio Brook) who has been searching for years for the device. He has tracked it down to Jesus' shop and sends his simple minded nephew, Angel de la Guardia (brilliantly portrayed by Ron Perlman), to get the statue that has stored in it, the Cronos device. When the statue turns up empty, Dieter instructs Angel to get the device at any cost.In the meantime, Jesus has become addicted to using the device. His young granddaughter has noticed him using it and decides for his own good to hide it from him. After spending time with her he realizes that maybe the sacrifices of the device, such as his wife not feeling as youthful as him, or his greedy and manic need to possess and have control of the device, are not worth the benefits.The story is not fast paced by any means, but the development of the characters is superb. There are also slow moving scenes with huge amounts of tension, in particular a scene where Jesus is at a party where someone had cut himself and cleaned up in the bathroom. Jesus finds himself drawn to the blood that had dripped on the floor and after slowly considering it and getting his face closer to it, he has his cheek against the floor and extends his tongue and licks up the drops!I have seen the video a couple times, but it is on DVD in region 2 PAL format only.

Make sure you have a good color set, as the factory scenes feature arresting and riotous color changes.  You go from the brilliant flora of the candy-making room and the journey of the Wonkatania boat (she's tres jolie) to the starkness of the candybar TV studio.Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the movie scary or too intense for viewing with my youngsters.  You just have to keep things in context and play along with the joke, because, as Willy says at the end, nobody is harmed and they remain their same old selves, selfish or kind, according to their nature.  Besides, someone as gentle and kindhearted as WW would not allow ill to befall his guests.I also liked the musical numbers.  The Oompah-Loompahs reminded me of the Munchkins (without females, at least as far as we are shown, so how do they keep the line going?) and their memorable lyrics and midget-choreographed routines.  Fans will recognize the wonderfully distinctive singing voice of composer Anthony Newley on the opening number (Candy Man), lip-synched nicely by actor Aubrey Woods as Bill the candy store proprietor.  And a nod goes to Gene Wilder for his rendition of Pure Imagination, although he struggles to hold the concluding note.  But, that's no big deal considering its a comedy actor doing a song.The child actors are quite good, with Charlie being the good-hearted poor boy, whose relationship to Grandpa Joe is touching.  Julie Dawn Cole is perfect as the nasty and selfish spoiled rich kid, and the others delightfully annoying and over-the-top in their own ways (Mike Teevee, and Augustus Gloop, come on!).Its a fun film and a visual treat.  Give it an airing for a fun couple of hours of distraction and relaxation.

However by the end of the film I was glad that I could allow myself to watch such an extraordinary movie. With the feel of &#145;Boys Don't Cry', Bully stands out as a movie we can all learn from, but also understand what it means to be a teenager. It is also an astonishing look at the lives of young people in a downcast neighbourhood and the trouble that they do get into.This is the true story from 1993, where a group of friends planned to kill one of their own. Bobby Kent is not a nice guy. He beats up his best friend Marty every chance he gets, he abuses Marty's girlfriend Lisa, and rapes Lisa's friend Ali. One day Marty, Lisa and friends decide that enough is enough and plan to kill Bobby. However once the murder is committed, the group is unsure of how to handle the situation. Friends quickly turn into enemies, in a game that these teenagers did not know how to play.Until a friend of mine had pointed out that this film would be a good watch, I had not heard a thing about Bully. Boy did he turn out to be on the money, as from start to finish this film astounded me. This movie is the work of Larry Clark, who cleverly directs this film, with the mind set of a teenager. He pushes the boundaries of what makes a good movie, but I must commend him on his directive style which is original and fascinating.However, the camera work in this movie was a little hard for me to take at times. The women in this movie had to expose themselves many times, which I am sure pushed the envelope for what they thought was acceptable. I was amazed at how many scenes we see the naked body of a girl, as if the director is deliberately trying to point this out to us. Shots between the girl's legs, lying naked on the bed or simply going to the bathroom, the camera seemed fixated with this view. I was almost turned off the movie for this reason. Clark seems to me to be a voyeur, someone who deliberately show his audience graphic sexual detail. Then again I can see that he was trying to show us what these teenagers were like, one part of there existence was to be very sexual beings.There are some extraordinary scenes in &#145;Bully'. I like the scene which shows the group discussing how to they are going to commit the murder. It is ingeniously shot as the camera circles around the group for at least two minutes. This made me feel two things. One that I was part of the group and two that these people were in no frame of mind to do anything, much less plan a murder. Yet the murder scene itself was well shot. I believe it paints an accurate picture of what really happened to Bobby Kent. I also like how the different members of the group react to what has just happened. Once again the camera work is crucial to this scene. It is as if we are we are actually there helping to kill Bobby and being affected as well.The young cast put with this movie do a wonderful job with some demanding roles, as none of these characters have no place to hide. Nick Stahl played the violent and abusive Bobby well. His role was so believable, that many times when I saw him onscreen I shouted &#145;I hate you&#145;. Watch out for Nick whose starring in the third &#145;Terminator' movie. His supposed best friend Marty was performed by the unknown Brad Renfro. I like how we are introduced to these characters, as Marty is bullied by Bobby, which shows that Bobby has been a cruel friend for many years. This also sets the tone for what's to come. Marty's girlfriend Lisa was performed well by Rachel Miner. By the end of the film Miner gives her character such an evil manner, that she seems just as guilty as anyone of the murder. Bijou Philips portrayal of Ali was amazing. As well as being into sexual experimentation, her character used her seductiveness to distract Bobby, enabling the group to murder him.Let me get one thing straight, the world is not disadvantaged by the loss of Bobby Kent, as he was a wicked and &#145;bullying' human being.  But does anyone deserve to be murdered like he was? I say no, because although he did do some appalling things to his friends, Bobby had no way of being sorry, even though he pleads with Marty as he is attacked `I am sorry for whatever I have done'. His &#145;friends' did get there just desert when they were put on trial. With the conflicting stories I am certain that whoever was handing down the sentences to these cruel people, must have had a difficult time doing so. In the end, Bobby's friends were just as bad as he was, showing that this entire group of friends were &#145;Bullies' in one way or another.

And if you have doubts on why Al Pacino is a fantastic actor, just look at this! I don't care who you are, this man is great and always will be!Finally, if I were to choose my favorite directors I probably wouldn't remember Sidney Lumet at all. Still, Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico stand, to me, as two monuments of that big american movie-making legacy we all grew up with. A reference and a lession that movies should, at their core, be about people and the complexities of the human spirit.So, let's rewind...

Director Luc Besson is a man who works with style, be it the deadly serious (The Professional) or the deathly goofy (Fifth Element) either way he always has a distinct style functioning through out. This is the story of Nikita. We see Nikita at the start of the film as a drugged out addict who mumbles nothing more than I need it. The hunt for drugs goes terribly wrong and she is sentenced to death by lethal injection for killing a cop, but deep down in the back of our minds we have to wonder if she even knows what she did. She is then given the needle but awakens in an entirely white room (Heaven?) and greeted by a man dressed all in black telling her that she is dead (God?), or so everyone thinks. That man is Bob and he informs her that she will be given a second chance at life if she trains to be a secret agent. As the film progresses and we seen Nikita's transformation you almost have to wonder if death may have been more merciful. When we hear the word secret agent we usually think James Bond, but this is anything but a 007 rip-off. It is a bloody action flick, a high tension thriller, a harrowing love story and a beautiful tragedy. I've said it about the Professional and I will say it again, this film owes more to Romeo and Juliet than it does to Goldeneye or Octapussy. The love story between Nikita and her fiancée is packed full of emotion and raw feeling just like your would expect from the French theatre. There is always one element in place that we cannot forget, Nikita is living a double life and her fiancée doesn't know about it, creating conflict between the two adding another layer of hardship to Nikita's life. A situation like this could be hard to make both romantic and thrilling but Besson handles it with style and grace. Besson is an expert at making action films with morals, films that will invigorate and entice as much as it will put you on the edge of your seat. Besson also throws in Jean Reno as Victor the cleaner (that's hit man for those who haven't seen The Professional) who acts as a heightened point on suspense but takes his role to such an extreme that he also substitutes as an outlet for dark humour. All of the actors walk around with droll expressions on their faces, like all of them have the power to be happy but all refuse to, part of Nikita's training it to learn how to smile properly. This raises the feeling of tragedy, never before have I seen a film where the way a character is portrayed is used as a method of foreshadowing. You get the feeling from the very beginning that this will not be a happy film and all of the actors show it on their faces and speak it in the voices, even a scene where Nikita kisses Bob and says I will never kiss you again depict the future of the film, this film is acted in such an artistic manner that it is almost a little to exhilarating to take all at once. This film keeps its action exciting, its suspense thrilling, its love passionate and its overall impact strong. IN other worlds this film packs one heel of a punch and there is no way a film like this could have been made in America or by anyone else but Besson. My only problem with the film is that the subtitles tend to clash with the backgrounds making them almost impossible to read, leaving the viewer to get lost in the films complexity, other than that this film is a true art form.

The story by no means has a happy ending, but it leaves the viewer feeling as if there's some hope for the future--even if the future seems a little shaky.  There was a rough edit here and there, but the lighting was flat-out gorgeous, and the cinematography overall very well done and very beautiful.Ben Silverstone plays Steven Carter, the main character, and he couldn't have done a better job.  He's believable, lovable and you find yourself attached to him very quickly.  His character grows a great deal from beginning to end, and he did a phenomenal job.  Brad Gorton, who plays his love interest, is relatively good, although he seems as if he'd have benefited from just a bit more directing.  I don't mean to sound as if he was *bad* (because by no means was his performance bad), but he had marginal room for improvement.
