I really loved it although I'm not sure if there was much chemistry between Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. Like most screwballs I've watched, this one also sets place in a newspaper publisher (The Morning Post), which already sets up the stage for people talking over each other and quick dialogue. Russell is Hildegaard (Hildy), the ex-wife of Grant, who is Walter Burns the editor of The Morning Post, and of course, it's obvious that Walter is going to try to get Hildy back. And like most screwballs, Hildy already has another man! While the story is quite predictable, it's the acting on Russell's end and sometimes Grant's that makes this film great. I knew what was going to happen, but the quick dialogue is what kept me watching. I could have cared less about the whole newspaper story, but I couldn't keep my eyes off of Russell. Grant had some great moments when he would make these weird groaning\/moaning noises that were perfect for the scene. Ralph Bellamy plays Bruce, and of course, he is the guy Hildy is going to marry, but if you've watched some screwballs, you probably know what happens to Bruce in the end. There was a great line when Walter tells one of his assistants to find Bruce and when he describes Bruce, he says, He looks like that fellow in the movies - Ralph Bellamy. I should be on the look out for more movie references in screwballs since I noticed one in Bringing Up Baby as well. It was nice to see Ralph Bellamy again since I saw him in The Awful Truth as well and he pretty much played the same character, which made me chuckle a bit. And how could I not mention Howard Hawks in this post, right? For those who don't know, Hawks is a well-known director by film buffs and has directed numerous famous films. Maybe you know him as the director of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (you know, the film with Marilyn Monroe singing Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend!) but let me tell you, he has never disappointed me with any of his films. I loved how he used some subtleties like in a scene when Hildy, Bruce, and Walter are at a restaurant and with the things they ordered and their actions, it was as if it was foreshadowing the ending of this film. First it starts with Walter deciding what he'll get and Hildy simply saying that she'll get the same, and Bruce kind of goes with it as well. Then both Hildy and Walter take out cigarettes and when Hildy lights a match, Walter simply drags Hildy's match over to his cigarette and Hildy gives him a look of annoyance and then lights her own cigarette. I noticed that Bruce didn't smoke in the scene and then Walter orders coffee with rum and Hildy gets the same thing, but Bruce says that he doesn't want it. After watching the film, I realized that the scene (the one I just mentioned) was the film in a nutshell. At the beginning, it all appears to be that the three characters are on an equal plane, yet it is Walter who orders first in a forceful voice and when Hildy orders the same in a simple manner, it was as if ordering the roast beef sandwich was something they usually did and was nothing new to her. Then when they both start smoking and Walter doing the thing he does with the match, it's like bringing Walter and Hildy together and finally with the coffee, it is solidifying the bond between Walter and Hildy while Bruce is in the outskirts. Well, that's just my interpretations of things, but I thought that Hawks directed that scene and the rest of the film incredibly well. I highly suggest that you watch this film if you're up for a good laugh.

Of course the first one was a classic, but the rest isn't as high as the 1967 movie on ALL the levels. Rather I see that this very rest wasn't necessary in the first place! Look at them. The first (Beneath the Planet of the Apes - 1970) was maybe the lousiest sequel ever made. Being totally pointless, repeating the first one yet poorly and meaninglessly. However it defined the way of exploiting the success of the original movie. (Escape from the Planet of the Apes - 1971) was the first in 3 idiot prequels. It was the funny episode, but it was also one of the silliest movies. And if it was produced for little entertainment then it would've been better if it wasn't made. (Conquest of the Planet of the Apes - 1972) was a dull version of Spartacus. And it has the worst title in the series as well! By this far I didn't know for whom exactly these movies were made ?! (and I still don't!). But I bet, the studio was happy and earning some profits out of it; again and again something was wrong with the American cinema, or strictly speaking the American audience, in the 1970s ! Now it's the winter of MY discontent. Because (Battle for the Planet of the Apes - 1973) wasn't as bad as the above. It's the best of the worst. Compared to the rest it's more snug and less idiot. This time it got solid screenplay as a decent B movie. But is it suitable for more than one watching ? I don't think so, unless you're a die-hard fan of the series (god help you!), or a fan of the old cheap western adventure flicks, or a fan of the most campy movies along the history of cinema ! I believe (J. Lee Thompson) at the time was the man who can make not bad movies out of low budgets. He managed here to give the simple movie somehow an attractive image. Looking fine as a pilot for a TV show. But the masks were horrible, the music was like any soundtrack was done for TV at the moment (it's dangerous situation so let's put some noisy wind instruments and screaming violins to horror the viewers !), the editing was artless; the black dude thought A LOT to discover the murder, suddenly you'd find a shot for Cesar's wife making up the bed while talking about his parents, and the battle at the end was nothing but many uninterrupted explosives only! And one more note  the parent's tapes were a farce ! (Roddy McDowall) tried much (by his eyes, voice, and the body performance). He even was somewhat lovely and serious. But sorry, he seemed wasted like a propaganda employee who's wearing a body suit along with inflexible character-mask, standing among badly-made toys! It's the way Hollywood industry deals with its talents sometimes. The human team's actors were pathetic. I didn't have the honor of knowing the name of the one who performed their leader who has a blood lust. In fact this guy gave me a high blood pressure! He looked like Rod Steiger' younger brother who can't act well, or just can't act ! The main apes story had suffered from high triteness to this point, running wretched and so uninterestingly thin. So, don't busy yourself thinking what it means? Ah.. there is something about saying yes to living all in peace and no to violence but don't bother, because it's an adventure movie and nothing more. Therefore the last scene with a crying statue for the dead saver was a desperate attempt to look sad or deep; it seemed over the top and out of the mood as Caesar is not Christ. Or he is if you're a devoted fan of these movies. So, as you see, it's the winter of my discontent Not the end of it ! I felt relief when I discovered that the 4 years exploitation had ended with this one, but who said so ?!! There was  one short lived TV series directly in the next year (1974), followed in (1975) by animated TV series yet short lived too ! and TV movies (have been edited from the first series) as well ! Not to mention the foolish remake of the first movie Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes (2001) which by the way looks like the 4 movies that were produced after the original but with big production and some quality. Simply all what Franklin Schaffner's Plant of the Apes (1967) did is being successful.. Damn ! It's sometimes a curse in a town named Hollywood, if you want to know why, so you have to watch all of its followings to understand that well, then you have to watch the remake to understand that the exploitations will never end! So if this treatment is the fate, and as much as I hated it  it is, so I hope someday for one good sequel, prequel, remake, (or hell.. parody!) that gives us any good time, or good idea&#x85;I'm not that covetous to wish both!

But say what you like about the academy; a list of Best Picture winners gives you a better indication than any other what movies caught the mood of the times and what Hollywood aspired to in any given era.The above is especially true in the 1940s, when society and cinema were changing fast &#x96; mostly due to the war. Mrs Miniver was released about six months after the US joined the conflict. For most Americans the war was an increasingly real and scary prospect, yet the full horror and scale of it had not yet hit home. Mrs Miniver was a perfect propaganda story for these times, because rather than panicking the audience with grim realities it optimistically presents the war as an inconvenience to be endured, and even as a suburban adventure.The picture benefits from some very strong storytelling, the screenwriters taking the time to establish the characters and their relationships before the outbreak of war. This shows us what normality is for these people before it is disrupted, as well giving the various story arcs a more satisfying payoff at the end. Unfortunately the characters themselves are stereotypes &#x96; of course all to the purpose of the picture's nature as propaganda, but a little grating today.Luckily, the director is William Wyler, not only a brilliant craftsman of cinema but someone who could bring the best out of drama because he focused so much on the performers. He brings Greer Garson's face to our attention right from the off, and she is rarely off screen from that point on. Although Wyler's style is generally quite understated and unobtrusive, he could still pull some pretty nifty tricks to get the right faces in the frame at any given time. A particularly neat moment is when Henry Travers shows Garson the Miniver rose. As she leans towards the flower, she obscures Travers' face, but the camera moves with her and we now see Travers reflected in a mirror. It's important that we see her movement &#x96; it shows her genuine interest &#x96; but we also need to see his reaction, and his sudden appearance in the mirror brings it to our attention.The upshot of Wyler's actor-centred direction is that he tended to coax some excellent performances from his cast. Garson is under a lot of pressure, bring at the centre of the movie, but she pulls it off superbly. Theresa Wright is of course very good too, but nicest of all are the deep performances where you don't expect them. Henry Travers and Dame May Witty are essentially character actors brought in to tick a few boxes, but here both are at their best and they actually manage to give some credibility to their two-note roles. And Henry Wilcoxon, normally a rather bland fixture of Cecil B. DeMille epics, is flawless as the vicar and gives such heartfelt delivery on his final speech that it was apparently broadcast on Voice of America.These touches of quality aside, and while Mrs Miniver was surely a moving and effective propaganda piece in its time, we don't live in 1942 and we have to judge it upon how it looks today. Hollywood's distance from England and the war is noticeable, and the overall tone seems almost disrespectfully cheerful. Several moments just look a bit silly &#x96; for example a dogfight taking place at forty feet, and what I call the talking boat scene (you'll know it when you see it). A truer and deeper picture of the home front was painted in British-made features such as In Which we Serve. And it's not the lack of combat and action that brings Mrs Miniver down &#x96; after all look how effectively the post-combat drama Best Years of Our Lives conveys the impact of war with no action whatsoever. It's simply that Mrs Miniver pulls too many punches, is too soft and too light. And yet, at the time, what else could it be?

A particularly neat moment is when Henry Travers shows Garson the Miniver rose. As she leans towards the flower, she obscures Travers' face, but the camera moves with her and we now see Travers reflected in a mirror. It's important that we see her movement &#x96; it shows her genuine interest &#x96; but we also need to see his reaction, and his sudden appearance in the mirror brings it to our attention.The upshot of Wyler's actor-centred direction is that he tended to coax some excellent performances from his cast. Garson is under a lot of pressure, bring at the centre of the movie, but she pulls it off superbly. Theresa Wright is of course very good too, but nicest of all are the deep performances where you don't expect them. Henry Travers and Dame May Witty are essentially character actors brought in to tick a few boxes, but here both are at their best and they actually manage to give some credibility to their two-note roles. And Henry Wilcoxon, normally a rather bland fixture of Cecil B. DeMille epics, is flawless as the vicar and gives such heartfelt delivery on his final speech that it was apparently broadcast on Voice of America.These touches of quality aside, and while Mrs Miniver was surely a moving and effective propaganda piece in its time, we don't live in 1942 and we have to judge it upon how it looks today. Hollywood's distance from England and the war is noticeable, and the overall tone seems almost disrespectfully cheerful. Several moments just look a bit silly &#x96; for example a dogfight taking place at forty feet, and what I call the talking boat scene (you'll know it when you see it). A truer and deeper picture of the home front was painted in British-made features such as In Which we Serve. And it's not the lack of combat and action that brings Mrs Miniver down &#x96; after all look how effectively the post-combat drama Best Years of Our Lives conveys the impact of war with no action whatsoever. It's simply that Mrs Miniver pulls too many punches, is too soft and too light. And yet, at the time, what else could it be?

But say what you like about the academy; a list of Best Picture winners gives you a better indication than any other what movies caught the mood of the times and what Hollywood aspired to in any given era.The above is especially true in the 1940s, when society and cinema were changing fast &#x96; mostly due to the war. Mrs Miniver was released about six months after the US joined the conflict. For most Americans the war was an increasingly real and scary prospect, yet the full horror and scale of it had not yet hit home. Mrs Miniver was a perfect propaganda story for these times, because rather than panicking the audience with grim realities it optimistically presents the war as an inconvenience to be endured, and even as a suburban adventure.The picture benefits from some very strong storytelling, the screenwriters taking the time to establish the characters and their relationships before the outbreak of war. This shows us what normality is for these people before it is disrupted, as well giving the various story arcs a more satisfying payoff at the end. Unfortunately the characters themselves are stereotypes &#x96; of course all to the purpose of the picture's nature as propaganda, but a little grating today.Luckily, the director is William Wyler, not only a brilliant craftsman of cinema but someone who could bring the best out of drama because he focused so much on the performers. He brings Greer Garson's face to our attention right from the off, and she is rarely off screen from that point on.

For its time it was a daring film involving the younger man with an older woman. But couples like that from Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine to Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore should be inspired by this film.The film opens with Jane Wyman as a recent and well provided for widow with grown children Gloria Talbott and William Reynolds. They're all in favor of mother getting married again, they've even got a husband in mind for her, attentive neighbor Conrad Nagel from their country club set.But when she announces that she'd like to marry their gardener, Rock Hudson, this scandalizes everyone in their very WASPy and respectable suburban town. Rock's a rather unusual gardener however. A Korean War veteran who did attend agricultural college at one point, he's developed a Thoreau like philosophy of life, he even has his own Walden Pond where he keeps the tree nursery and spends all his time. He's even fixed up the old mill on the place as a honeymoon cottage.After such fare on television as suburban housewives, stuff like All That Heaven Allows is pretty tame and pretty dated. Still the players are earnest and sincere and it's a film where you can for once see Agnes Moorehead as a nice lady as Wyman's best friend and supporter.
