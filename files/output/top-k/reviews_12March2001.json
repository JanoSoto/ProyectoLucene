The plot is nowhere near being original and the characters have no real motivation. Even worse, the best performance in the film (Cheng Pei-pei as Jade Fox) was sadly all too short.

I love Michelle Yeoh as an actress and, despite a solid performance, I felt she was not at her best.

Set in Scotland, Ewan McGregor stars as Renton, a young man to whom drugs have become a way of life; in fact, more than a `way of' life, they have `become' his life.  And a more filthy, degrading lifestyle one would be hard put to imagine.  Renton has arrived at a point wherein absolutely nothing means anything to him  Family, friends, job, nothing.  All that matters is the next fix.  And to get it, he will do whatever it takes, including robbing, stealing or even betraying his mates.  It's a hard life, but to `Rents' the high-- even with the total loss of self esteem-- makes it all worth it; and he'll get it any way he can  Snorting, shooting up or using suppositories.  Eventually, however, Renton's bad life gets even worse, and as he emerges on morning from has drug-induced haze, he realizes things are going to have to change.  The question is, can he do it?  Or will he even want to. \tThe film is a hard look at the depths to which an addict will descend and what one will do to get that fix.  To illustrate the point, there is one graphic scene (almost too hard to watch), in which Renton, losing a couple of suppositories (they had yet to melt) through a sudden act of nature, proceeds upon realizing it to turn around and fish for them in the `filthiest toilet in Scotland.'  The scene is almost unbearable, but what an example of what it means to be in thrall to drugs.  In another scene, not quite as graphic but powerful nonetheless, Renton's parents lock him in his room and he is forced to go `cold turkey.'  And although, after the aforementioned scene this is a bit easier to watch, it is still unpleasant, but delivers a succinct message about the nature of drug addiction.\t \tMcGregor is well cast as Renton, as he brings a clean-cut look to the part that seems so contradictory to the lifestyle embraced by the character.  The perfect choice of all the characters through which to tell the story, Renton has a look and an attitude that convey a life that holds such promise; here is a lad with a future.  And therein lies a message in itself  When drugs are involved, never judge a book by it's cover, for addiction is never discerning.  Most importantly, McGregor's performance is believable and he has a charismatic screen presence that makes Renton someone with whom the audience will readily be able to identify, which is necessary for the film to work.  Without that connection, much of the message of this film would be lost, but thanks to McGregor, as well as some bold moments courtesy of director Boyle, it is not. \tThe supporting cast includes Ewen Bremmer (Spud), Jonny Lee Miller (Sick Boy), Kevin McKidd (Tommy), Robert Carlyle (Begbie), Kelly Macdonald (Diane) and Peter Mullan (Swanney).  One of the best anti-drug films in memory, `Trainspotting' will affect even the most jaded abuser of controlled substances, for it puts the situation into perspective and gives it context, while keeping it at (still an uncomfortable) arm's length.  It may be tough to watch, but there are lessons to be learned from it that are invaluable.  A great companion feature to the more recent `Traffic,' this is a film that will no doubt have a dramatic affect on those who see it, for the images it presents will not easily be forgotten. And if this film will save even one person from learning about drugs the hard way, then it will have made the endeavor entirely worthwhile.  Be advised, this film is more educational than entertaining, and definitely an experience.  I rate this one 8\/10.

Do not be fooled by the media hype, and particularly the stories about people throwing up in cinema and being mentally scarred for the rest of their lifes because of the brain - eating scene  in the movie it just comes across as laughably bad SFX. Why so many people in this forum are claiming that H is not all bad and worth watching on the big screen, etc., is beyond me;  and it is not so bad it's good either, it is just plain boring.  I normally respect other people's opinion, but in this case I have to say that they clearly can not tell **** from Shine - Ola.  Maybe they have fallen prey to the media hype, maybe they have never seen a Ridley Scott movie before and were impressed by his excessive use of back lighting, smoke and the ubiquitous AC fans.  H is totally devoid of suspense;  instead we get endless scenes of Lecter swanning through an English - speaking Firenze, a totally unconvincing and uninvolving plot with more holes than a fishing net (after seeing H, I actually lay awake half of the night trying to find all the holes in the plot, and when I wrote them down I quickly filled 6 pages in small type before forcing myself to stop).  Rather than wasting your time and money on seeing it on the big screen, I would advise you to wait until it comes on TV in a couple of years;  and then to go to bed early.1 \/ 10.Below are a couple of extra bones I have to pick with Hannibal- H _is_ the sequel to SOTL, despite what some people in this forum are claiming.  And even though SOTL was a very tough act to follow, there are sequels which _are_ en par with their predecessors (SOTL itself was the sequel to Michael Mann's Manhunter, based on Thomas Harris' Red Dragon, and even though the first episode was a very enjoyable film, SOTL was even better;  another example would be the Alien series initiated by H's director Ridley Scott -- so much for the theory of diminishing sequels).  In any case, being a sequel is no excuse for a film being utter crap.- This movie has a renowned director, it is based on a novel by the same author as SOTL, the cast is strictly A - list, great cinematography, big budget, first - rate script writers, yadda, yadda, yadda, and the end result is simply a fart in the church.  So what went wrong?  I think a lot of the blame has to go to the film's producer, Dino DeLaurentiis.  Here is my interpretation  DDL produced Manhunter, which, despite of all its qualities, was a commercial flop.  Disappointed, he gave the rights for the Hannibal Lecter character to Orion -- for free, allowing Jonathan Demme to make SOTL, and the rest is cinema history.  DDL then had to wait for ten more years (he is now 81) until Thomas Harris finally came up with the sequel novel.  I think at this point DDL had lost all interest in making a good movie and was desperate to finally get his slice of the the cake before he pops his cork.- Another aspect that I find thoroughly annoying about this flick is that it is being given so much undeserved hype in the media;  I mean, it is boring, yet one of the highest - grossing productions ever, so there is no need to give it free publicity.  And while most reviewers harp on about how Dantesque the scenes in Firenze are and why Jodie Foster did not participate, the simple fact that this movie is an utter, utter, UTTER flop goes unmentioned.  But there is more  not only is Hannibal being hyped through the roof, it is also being used as a media agenda setter for a plethora of documentaries (usually the left - overs from similar productions in the wake of SOTL) about serial killers, cannibalism and profiling.  However, not only does H not even pretend to be realistic; Lecter has also ceased to be a serial killer (he now only kills out of necessity, or to help Clarice Starling), profiling is not even mentioned (because we already know HL, so there is no need to create a profile) and there is also no cannibalism  Lecter feeds the drugged - up Paul Krendler his own brain, so that makes it (erm) unaware vivo - auto - cannibalism. Try making a documentary out of that.- Much has been said about the acting  mainly whether Julianne Moore can replace Jodie Foster, and Anthony Hopkins (who plays the lead Hannibal Lecter) is usually given a lot of praise.  I think all of these discussions are moot.  There are several of my favourite actors in this movie (namely Liotta, Oldman and Moore) but the script simply does not give them anything to work with.  Same for Hopkins  there is no development in his character, and he is not being challenged in any way.  And by the way, he plays nearly identical characters in all of his movies, only that in H he has to do the odd bit of murder and is getting paid the tidy sum of $ 11 Million to do it.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"12 March 2001","score":"9 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":"  Synopsis  the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal is a big budget production that totally fails to deliver;  not only is it not as clever as its predecessor, it is not even a splatter or suspense or horror movie, just a totally boring time waster.  Do not be fooled by the media hype, and particularly the stories about people throwing up in cinema and being mentally scarred for the rest of their lifes because of the brain - eating scene  in the movie it just comes across as laughably bad SFX. Why so many people in this forum are claiming that H is not all bad and worth watching on the big screen, etc., is beyond me;  and it is not so bad it's good either, it is just plain boring.  I normally respect other people's opinion, but in this case I have to say that they clearly can not tell **** from Shine - Ola.  Maybe they have fallen prey to the media hype, maybe they have never seen a Ridley Scott movie before and were impressed by his excessive use of back lighting, smoke and the ubiquitous AC fans.  H is totally devoid of suspense;  instead we get endless scenes of Lecter swanning through an English - speaking Firenze, a totally unconvincing and uninvolving plot with more holes than a fishing net (after seeing H, I actually lay awake half of the night trying to find all the holes in the plot, and when I wrote them down I quickly filled 6 pages in small type before forcing myself to stop).  Rather than wasting your time and money on seeing it on the big screen, I would advise you to wait until it comes on TV in a couple of years;  and then to go to bed early.1 \/ 10.Below are a couple of extra bones I have to pick with Hannibal- H _is_ the sequel to SOTL, despite what some people in this forum are claiming.  And even though SOTL was a very tough act to follow, there are sequels which _are_ en par with their predecessors (SOTL itself was the sequel to Michael Mann's Manhunter, based on Thomas Harris' Red Dragon, and even though the first episode was a very enjoyable film, SOTL was even better;  another example would be the Alien series initiated by H's director Ridley Scott -- so much for the theory of diminishing sequels).  In any case, being a sequel is no excuse for a film being utter crap.- This movie has a renowned director, it is based on a novel by the same author as SOTL, the cast is strictly A - list, great cinematography, big budget, first - rate script writers, yadda, yadda, yadda, and the end result is simply a fart in the church.  So what went wrong?  I think a lot of the blame has to go to the film's producer, Dino DeLaurentiis.  Here is my interpretation  DDL produced Manhunter, which, despite of all its qualities, was a commercial flop.  Disappointed, he gave the rights for the Hannibal Lecter character to Orion -- for free, allowing Jonathan Demme to make SOTL, and the rest is cinema history.  DDL then had to wait for ten more years (he is now 81) until Thomas Harris finally came up with the sequel novel.  I think at this point DDL had lost all interest in making a good movie and was desperate to finally get his slice of the the cake before he pops his cork.- Another aspect that I find thoroughly annoying about this flick is that it is being given so much undeserved hype in the media;  I mean, it is boring, yet one of the highest - grossing productions ever, so there is no need to give it free publicity.

Sure, there have been great movies like Almost Famous and Gladiator.  But I was sorely disappointed in Traffic and Crouching Tiger.  I haven't been excited about a movie coming out in a LONG time.  So, I was excited about 15 Minutes.  It has DeNiro (who is one of my favorite actors), it has Edward Burns (this guy is going up in this business, he's really good), and a great plot.  Well, guess what?  This is the first time in a long time I have NOT been disappointed.15 Minutes is a violent and mad little movie.  It has its share of flaws. The message in the beginning of the movie is that the media is crazy. After about an hour, that message is lost.  But, it does come back.  I really cannot see why people hate this movie.  I think that because of all the bad movies that have been constantly coming out of Hollywood, critics have been put into a p***ed off mood that when a movie isn't absolutely perfect, they hate it.15 Minutes is fast, fun, violent, and tense.  This movie is filled with edgy suspense.  John Hertzfield (the writer & director) has done a magnificent job of bringing these worlds together.  We see the same story from both sides of the spectrum from the killer's pov and the cop's pov.The acting is beautiful, as is the cinematography.  I think this is some of the best directing I have seen in a while.  I will defiantly start keeping an eye on Hetzfield's career from now on.  Many people say that the colors are too `ugly'.  We'll the movie's topic is ugly.  Fight Club is an `ugly' looking film too, and it's number 40 on the top 250 list.  Yea, the movie is dark.  It's a dark movie.  GET OVER IT.  As long as you can see what's going on, it doesn't matter.My only real problem with the movie is that the movie has mixed tones. Sometimes the music is light and happy, like a comedy.  Sometimes it's brilliantly suspenseful.  The music in this movie is some of the best and worst all year.  It's good b\/c when the chase scenes start, there is this brilliant drum beating which helps tense up the scene.  But during some other scenes, the music is awkwardly happy.  Music in film is always hard to explain so when or if you see this movie, take notice to what I'm talking about.Another problem is that I wish that some of the characters could have been a little better developed.  This is not too big of a problem, because this is a character driven movie.  The killer's characters are very well developed. I think the killers are actually the main characters.  But the cops (DeNiro and Burns) are very distant.  We never really get to know too much about Burns's character, except through what happens in the story, AKA, indirect characterization.  But the fine performances, especially by the killers and the supporting cast, well makes up for it.Many people criticize the movie for being `out of date'.  They say that the media is no longer crazy, that the `Jerry Springer' phase is over with, and that the Cold War is done and over with.  The media craziness, unless you people are just blind, still exists.  Remember the 2000 election?  Believe me, the media is just as crazy as it has always been.  The `Jerry Springer' phase refers to the killers.  They are always watching Springer, which is where they learn that Americans are very forgiving.  These killers are from the Czech Republic; they have never seen Springer before.  It interests them, a little too much.  The Cold War reference refers to the movies main characters, the killers.  There is nothing involving the Cold War in this movie.  The main characters are just from the Czech Republic.  Just because two or three of the characters are from Eastern Europe gives no one the right to compare this movie to the Cold War (as some other IMDB critics have done).I really believe that 15 Minutes is one of the best movies I have seen in quite sometime.  Die hard film people will not like this movie because there's nothing too new.  But the average film person (who I always try to represent) will like this movie.  If you're in the mood for a realistic, very well done suspense movie, then check out 15 Minutes.If you don't like movies like 15 Minutes, then why the hell do you go to the movies?  For the hotdogs?

Upon release from prison, New York crime boss Frank White (Walken), determines to become a major player in the city's underworld and wastes no time in putting the wheels of his plan in motion.  Among the major obstacles he encounters are King Tito (Ernest Abuba) and Larry Wong (Joey Chin), both kingpins of their respective organizations, veteran detective Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), and Dennis Gilley (David Caruso), a young, hot-headed Irish cop who seemingly single-handedly wants to take back the city from the riffraff who control it and seem somehow impervious to prosecution.  None of which matters to White, who is adamant in his quest to become the King of New York. \tThough hard-hitting and excessively violent, Ferrara's film lacks the grittiness of say, Scorsese's `Mean Streets,' or `Taxi Driver,' but nevertheless makes an impact, due mainly to the unfettered violence, as well as the subtle, understated menace Walken brings to the role of Frank White.  There's an edginess that permeates the film and the characters who bring it all to life, with the exception of White, who-- as played by Walken-- is the picture of restraint, the eye in the center of the storm.  And it's that cold, soulless, almost haunted look of his that makes him so disconcerting.  It's the contrast between his calm demeanor (which threatens to explode at any moment) and the overt violence with which he is surrounded, that gives him that sense of power, and it's also one of the strengths of the film.  There is definitely something unsettling about Walken's presence in a role like this (and indeed with many of the characters he's portrayed in his many films); he has a natural ability and the looks-- which he uses so well to his advantage-- to convey the very essence of evil in all it's myriad forms.  If they is any doubt, check him out in `Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead,' and `Sleepy Hollow,' just to mention a couple.  He has the tools to make you believe his characters, and with adroit skill he uses them all, as he does here with his creation of White; and his performance is one of the highlights of the movie.   \tWalken doesn't have the floor to himself in that regard, however, as Laurence Fishburne (billed here as `Larry') gives a memorable, high-powered performance as well, as Jump, White's main man who provides the muscle for his organization.  Fishburne pulls out all the stops and laces Jump with high voltage energy that never runs out, while taking a page from the John Woo Book by brandishing pistols in both hands at once, which serves to enhance his lethal potential.  And his over-the-top, in-your-face attitude is the perfect antithesis to Walken's calm, and is in it's own way just as disturbing in the aloof disregard of-- and lack of respect for-- life.  I guarantee this is one pair of hoodlums you will not soon forget. \tThe supporting cast includes Wesley Snipes (Thomas), Janet Julian (Jennifer), Giancarlo Esposito (Lance), Paul Calderon (Joey) and Steve Buscemi (Test Tube).  Ferrara's film is fast paced and relentless, and he adds a nice touch to the ending that contrasts well with all that precedes it, and yet `King of New York,' even with the outstanding performances of Walken and Fishburne, never quite captures that elusive something that would've taken it above and beyond the average crime action\/drama.  It does have it's moments, however, and the aforementioned performances alone are worth the price of admission.

The idea was cool.  Basically, some murderous criminals who want to make a movie, so they steal a little camera and document their bloody crimes.  Cool idea for a movie, but the director dropped the ball.  This movie totally missed its mark.  A lot of people have commented on the violence.  Well, there was some violence, but I was never able to take this movie seriously.  It seemed to be immitating violent movies more than actually being violent and gorey.  It didn't have the same brutal, violent feeling that some of the scary movies made in the 80's had. And the violence never had that gritty, dirty, scary feeling that makes your stomache turn, like in SEVEN.  The cliches in this movie are ENDLESS.

Not all of those movies are the greatest thing ever made.  I still think the Godfather or Saving Private Ryan are tied for the best movie ever made.  The above mentioned movies are films that appeal to me personally and have sentimental value.(Oh, I may have left out some movies in the previous list, so I will probably kill myself later for leaving them out.)Gattaca is a great movie for many reasons.  But if I had to pick my favorite part of the movie, it would have to be the music.  Music in cinema can add to a movie or destroy it; it is that fragile.  It is there to surround the movie in warmth and atmosphere.  Sometimes movies overuse music, making the music try to create the emotion that the movie can't provide by itself. This is a form of cheating.  But Gattaca uses its music to add to the atmosphere.  And what an atmosphere.Gattaca is a classic science fiction movie.  There are two types of sci\/fi true science fiction and action science fiction.  The difference is that true science fiction has an idea, surrounded in atmosphere that takes the audience to another world.  Action science fiction is a movie with a very high budget, a famous action movie star (Stalone or Arnold), a nice gimmick-idea, no logic, and a lot of cool special effects.  I like both kinds of sci\/fi.  But the former is the most rare.  Therefore, Gattaca is a rare movie indeed.Let me talk about the technical stuff.  The music?  The music is some of the most beautiful tunes I have ever heard in a movie.  Hey, Trevor Rabin!

The film is filled with future-esc ideas and gadgets, but it looks like something out of the 1950's.  The cars they drive, the furniture, the glasses, everything looks like something from Leave it to Beaver, but with future-esc twists.  Overall, it's brilliant and absolutely gorgeous.The story?

At the age of twelve I was mightily impressed and equally enjoyed the subsequent viewing of Parts I and III (hey, it's different).  Throughout my mid-teens I had an unhealthy diet of similar fare such as the numerous Friday The 13th's and A Nightmare On Elm Street's.  But by the time I saw Halloween IV in the early Nineties, my slasher &#145;bubble' had burst.  I found it predictable and daft.  The genre reached its nadir with Friday 13th Part VIII which I saw at about the same time and compounded my disillusionment.  So after about ten years I've returned to the Halloween franchise with instalment number five.  I wasn't expecting much and unfortunately my foresight was correct.Halloween 5 begins exactly where Part 4 left off (plus points for continuity).  After being shot repeatedly and falling down a mineshaft, Michael Myers (not the guy from Austin Powers and Wayne's World, alas) crawls away to a remote log cabin.  The old man within assists the unconscious and wounded Myers in his ignorance (shades of Bride Of Frankenstein here).  A year later, to coincide with All Hallows, Myers' niece, Jamie, who is now resident in a children's institution goes into an epileptic fit.  Her doctors are baffled and helpless, all except the ever present Dr. Loomis (and the viewer), who know what is about to happen.*spoilers related to Halloween 2*This brings us to the first of many inconsistencies in the film.  &#145;A year later', so for all this time Myers has been comatose in the old hermits hut as if he was part of the furniture!  A continuity error from earlier films is the recuperative power of both Myers and Loomis.  Both were torched at the end of Part 2, but only Loomis appears to have any burns (albeit not as bad as expected).  Also Myers had his eyes shot out in the same film, here the film has numerous close ups of his eyes which are in perfect condition!Horror veteran Donald Pleasance who has been in an inexhaustive list of horror films returns as Loomis.  The good include The Flesh And The Fiends, Death Line, From Beyond The Grave, Prince Of Darkness, and the first two Halloween films.  The bad includes Nothing Underneath, The Uncanny and Halloween 4.  The &#145;ugly' is Buried Alive.  Throughout Halloween 5 Pleasance appears quite fatigued which adds weight to his portrayal of Loomis, a man who has suffered a lot.  It is odd that anyone would let Loomis near a children's hospital, he is as obsessive and as freaky as Myers.  The only person he can relate to is his former patient, his worldview narrowed(cf. the &#145;mad' scientist of most horror).  His relationship is quite paternal, note the softness (love) in his voice as he talks to Myers.*spoilers for this film (to end)*As Myers was incarcerated as a child he could be considered a youth in adult form.  He gets up to his normal tricks and treats here, but seems to have reached adolescence.

I admit he is not one of my favorite actors, and despite the huge efforts that Hollywood made to include him in the big league I still have not seen him delivering a great performance.

But he is not even the worst thing in the movie. The storyline is... well, I would say predictable but that is an euphemism. All we get in this movie was seen before in other movies (mostly in average and bad movies, anyway). It is like a collection of the tiresome Hollywood standards for action movies. A futile love story, the usual bad guy that wants to do one of the standard bad things (I won't spoil it... just think of three things the standard bad guy from mediocre action movies would do, and you probably got at least two right).

There are only a couple of decent fight scenes, which is sad for a Kung Fu movie.  Jet Li really isn't much of an actor, he never has been, and it shows in this film.  He always does that sad, baby face look, and its just annoying.  There is no chemistry between any of the characters, the dialogue is dry and forced, and the plot is not compelling.  The one thing I did like about this movie was the special effects when the bad guys get killed and the camera turns in to an X-Ray vision shot and you can see the skeletons as the bones break and organs stop.  That was new and inventive and I liked it a lot.  But let me just say right here and now, Jet Li is NO MATCH for Jackie Chan.  Chan is MUCH better, more inventive, faster, more clever, and much more daring.  Jet Li has never been able to match the acrobatic abilities that Chan has, and Jet Li has never done a fight scene anywhere near as complicated or exciting as some of Chan's best work.  Also, Chan opened the door for movies like ROMEO MUST DIE.  Remember RUSH HOUR?  That was the first major movie in recent times to successfully pair up a Chinese Kung Fu master with a Hip-Hop Black star (Chris Tucker).  Jet Li is mearly following in the foot steps of Jackie Chan and leaching off of his success in the genre.  And what was the deal with Jet Li flying through the air on wires with computer enhancement?  Is he that out of shape?  Does he need that much help?  And if so, why not do it in a believable way?  The stunts they have him doing via the computer are completely ridiculous and absolutely laughable!  He completely defies gravity and the laws of physics, flies around sideways and then rights himself with no leverage.  It was completely absurd and very distracting.  It's sad that they used Crystal Method in the sound track.  That is such great music it deserves a movie more on the calibre of THE MATRIX, rather than this trash.
