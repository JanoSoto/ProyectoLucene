Many have nothing at all to do with the movie per se, but more with people's gripes about how other nations were portrayed in this movie.GET OVER IT!The movie portrays the efforts of the American Rangers on Omaha Beach. That's O-MA-HA. Not Gold, not Sword, not Juno. That's why there's no portrayal of French, Canadian, or British troops.It seems to me, that any time there is a movie that shows what the US did in WWII, and doesn't give equal time to the other allied troops, everyone needs to kvetch. What most seem to forget is that the US lost more troops than all the other allied forces combined, that they spent more than all the other counties, (which still have not paid the US back) and were it not for the US's involvement in WWII, all of Europe would today be wearing lederhosen and playing the accordian. This from a country that was not directly affected by the events taking place in EuropeSimilarly, I read many reviews taking umbrage with the negative comments directed towards Montgomery.GET OVER IT!Monty was a megalomaniac with a serious case of p*n*s envy because he couldn't run the whole show. Patton proved that he could out-battle, out-tactic, and out-run Monty in any theatre of war. Granted, Monty had some success in Africa, but he spent the rest of the war whining to Eisenhower for equal authority, and supplies, which (I believe) Eisenhower gave him to shut him up, at the expense of Patton's troops, who were taking names and kicking butt. What did Monty do? Why Operation Market Garden, of course. An operation that pretty much decimated all the allied forces that took part in it.Next, I read about so many people finding the middle of the movie boring. Do these commentators forget the adage about war being long periods of boredom interspersed with moments of sheer terror? What did you expect, that they fight a gazillion troops all the way to Ryan, and fight their way back out again unscathed? War IS like that. It is NOT like the current action movies out there today, where the hero might get grazed by a bullet and continue to fight, only to get the girl in the end.I also read about the Germans being demonized in this movie. How quickly they forget Auschwitz; how quickly they forget Dachau. How quickly they forget that as an occupying force, the Germans raped whomever they pleased, shot whomever they pleased. Millions of Germans bought into Hitler's promises. They willingly went to war for him. They tried to conquer the world, and cared not for the innocents they were slaughtering along the way.So don't whine about it. In this politically-correct, liberal, UN Peace-Keeping day, we forget that soldiers were encouraged back then to HATE their enemy; to believe him the devil. They called the enemy Krauts, and Nips, and Eye-Ties, so that when the time came to kill them, soldiers were able to do it. Back then we fought until they were defeated. Today, we do it until they say I'm sorry, and then pay them billions of dollars to rebuild. Finally, remember the scene after the US took the beach The scene of Americans carelessly shooting surrendering enemy forces. Don't try to say that it was one-sided.Lastly, I saved the D-Day beachhead for last. Too many people have commented that this was too gory, too long, too dully filmed, and not an accurate depiction of how war really is.

I grew up on cartoons derived from Star Wars (Ewoks and Driods to name 2 of them) but did not see the real mccoy until about 6 years ago.  When I first saw ANH I was expecting non-stop action, heaps of X-Wing and Tie-Fighter battles and light saber duels.  After 30 minutes I was disappointed in the lack of action, but after 60 minutes I was fully engrossed in the characters of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Pricess Leia and Obi-Wan Kenobi (and of course Vader).  I did not feel like I was able to feel any passion or emotion from the characters in Phantom Menace and this I think made the real difference.I also felt Phantom Menace was too uncreative on the plot and script.  The plot had too much of a and then we went here...and then we went there... feel.  All action, no brains.  The pod racing sequence was the biggest marketing ploy I had ever seen.  How quickly did a variant on a pod racing game for the PC or N64 appear in you local retailer?  I can tell you it was pretty quick over here and proved the real relevance of this sequence in the movie - I don't think it served much else.

The end of this sequence was a bit sorry though.  I though they could have done better than Obi-Wan launching up, grabbing a light saber and knocking Darth Maul down.  After such a long sequence it just seemed a bit short and sudden in my opinion.I won't mention Jar Jar because everyone else has already covered that.To those who say it is unfair to compare it to the other Star Wars movies, I disagree.

How quickly did a variant on a pod racing game for the PC or N64 appear in you local retailer?  I can tell you it was pretty quick over here and proved the real relevance of this sequence in the movie - I don't think it served much else.  I must however say that the final battle sequence was quite good - the battle at the droid control ship, the castle infiltration, the gungan battle.   They all combined to defeat the Trade Federation in a way I felt was reminiscient of the other Star Wars movies.And how can I forget the final light saber duel - fantastic stuff and well choreographed (even if lacking in the emotive passion evident in Vader v Skywalker from Return of the Jedi).  The end of this sequence was a bit sorry though.  I though they could have done better than Obi-Wan launching up, grabbing a light saber and knocking Darth Maul down.  After such a long sequence it just seemed a bit short and sudden in my opinion.I won't mention Jar Jar because everyone else has already covered that.To those who say it is unfair to compare it to the other Star Wars movies, I disagree.  This movie is supposed to be the start of the whole thing - every saga has a beginning.  It says Star Wars, it's related to Star Wars and so it will be compared to Star Wars.  This movie was never intended to stand alone and George Lucas should be thankful that it didn't.In conclusion, I feel that this could have been something great.  The character development in ANH set the foundation on which ESB and ROTJ built and ultimately succeeded.  Phantom Menace should have followed this winning formula.  I want to relate to Obi-Wan and Anakin.  I hope Episode II can do this.I give it 5\/10.  Cut out the final 30 minutes and it gets 2\/10.

Hal Needham still finds plenty of opportunities to fill the screen with stunts and there are several scenes of cars crashing through walls, flying in the air and dragging along entire houses with them, but the race has absolutely no urgency - at times you even forget there IS a race! The participants just don't seem very interested in winning. Maybe the movie is worth seeing just because it's your only chance to see Frank Sinatra, Richard Kiel and Jackie Chan in the same picture, but don't expect to see them doing anything important; the wandering script understandably gets lost among all those famous players, and the good moments are few and far between.
