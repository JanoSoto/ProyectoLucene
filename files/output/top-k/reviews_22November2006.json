[{"date":"22 November 2006","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" SPOILERS THROUGH Election had been recommended to me by a person or two who said if I was a big Reese Witherspoon fan(which I am) I needed to see this. I thought this was a very good movie, not what I expected at all, very different from the typical teen oriented movie although I'm not even sure I should lump this in as a teen flick since so much of the film is about adults, particularly Mathew Broderick. Whatever genre this film falls into I liked it and thought it was above average.The school election is one of the main plot points but it is by no means the only focus of the film and that's what's really striking about the movie. It's about the election and it is not at the same time. It really explores the psyches of the characters and who they are as people. It not only shows the good and bad in them but the viewer also gets to see some of the forces that forms them. I think the movie is unique in a way and really distinguishes itself as more then just another little high school flick. Definitely a movie well done.The performances were for the most part excellent. Reese Witherspoon was great as Tracy and brought a lot to the role. But I think Mathew Broderick also deserves kudos. I've never seen him stand out as much in a movie as this one but this was a role that fit him well and he was very good. The believability of the movie was one of it's strengths along with the fact that the characters could inspire so many conflicting emotions in the viewer. There are a few scenes that are deeply poignant and tough to watch such as the scene between a sobbing Tracy and her mom after the election. The movie also stays interesting and there isn't one dull moment in the whole thing.Despite the Positives I wouldn't call it perfect. I did think to much time was devoted to the teacher and also to little time to some of the other kids besides Tracy. The ending was sort of flat. Not because It wasn't a happy happy joy joy ending, but because it simply seemed to rush over the outcome of almost everyones' story except Broderick's. Some of the supporting cast were very strong and not enough time was given to them, both through the movie and at the wrap up at the end. That to me, was the film's biggest weakness.I would give the movie a strong 7.5 of 10 and recommend it especially for fans of any of these performers or people who like teen movies with edge.
