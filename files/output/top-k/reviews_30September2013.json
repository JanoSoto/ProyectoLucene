It's about a mobster family where the whole family is involved except one, because he's a college student. The family didn't want to involve him because he had a good educated head on his shoulders. When his father is out one day, there is a mafia hit on him; however things don't go as planned exactly. Long story short, the dad ends up in the hospital and the educated son feels the need to get involved and help his father out. To my surprise, the son who didn't want to be involved finds himself completely wrapped up in the mafia lifestyle. Shockingly due to previous mob movies that were not as popular with the box office, Paramount Pictures was very hesitant to adapt this film. It was a good thing they did because this was the start up to many successful mob movies. Mario Puzo is the author of the book The Godfather and thanks to the success from the book, the movie was able to be produced. In my opinion, I love the cast. Al Pacino is an amazing actor and he is known for mafia movies. I was shocked to find out he was almost fired from being in this movie! I can't imagine what it would have been like without him. All of the cast took their roles really seriously and met a lot of mobsters to really get the feel of the role.One of the most important thematic elements is the very first scene when the bride's dad goes into the room to ask a favor from the Godfather. This is important because it shows how respected and powerful the Godfather really is. That scene was really good for character development and plot. Italian lifestyle is a big part in this movie and one of the ways its portrayed is through the language. Throughout the movie there are some parts that are fully in Italian. Even if you're not Italian after watching this movie you'll be sure to feel like you are. Violence is a big thematic element in this movie. It is constantly happening in almost every other scene. Violence and death are big parts in the Italian\/ mafia lifestyle and thats how it always was and always will be. A very important scene happens right off the bat, Coppola didn't waste anytime! The father is shot, and was supposed to be killed. This is the motivation for the sons change of heart and priorities in life. Another important scene is when Michael goes to visit his father in the hospital bed. While he's in here he has his eureka moment and saves his fathers life. All in the same five minutes another important scene takes place. As Michael was leaving the hospital he runs into a dirty cop who is also in touch with the mafia, and there is an altercation, you'll have to watch to see what happens next! When Michael gets up his confidence, another crazy scene takes place. Michael became sneaky and learned the ways of the mafia. He goes into a sit down with the guys that are above him on the mafia ranking and when he goes to the bathroom he takes the gun that he planted prior to the sit-down and kills all the men at the table. Obviously this is a key point because it shows Michael's growth. The last important scene happens after a lot of deaths take place. There is really no one left in the family so the responsibility of running the family business falls into Michael's hands. This movie has a lot of story lines which only makes the movie more interesting. Obviously the mafia is a big one. In the first minute were in the room with the Godfather, the boss. Another storyline that unfolds is family relationships. The son, Michael didn't want anything to do with the mafia but once his father got involved he had to do what was right and stand by his father and help out anyway possible. Business is another storyline that keeps the movie moving. The Godfather's famous line is I'm going to make you an offer, you can't refuse. Every time the Godfather says this you know some type of business exchange is about to go down.I think the director did an amazing job of putting all of these story lines together. There was never a dull moment in the film from the first five minutes to the last. It wasn't like he added unnecessary scenes or additional story lines to make the movie more interesting, everything had a purpose and had me at the edge of my seat the whole three hours!The most important relationship that is developed in this film is the relationship between Michael and not only his father, but the whole family. He was always the outcast of the family because he never wanted to live the Italian lifestyle but as the movie rolls on, he becomes closer and closer to the lifestyle and more importantly, his family. By the end of the movie Michael's life becomes the whole family business, and let's just say there's a new Godfather in town.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"30 September 2013","score":"","review":" In following up those cinematic classics that I'm somehow still catching up on, I recently saw The Graduate for the first time. I inevitably went into it with some idea of what was going to happen, but little more than an expectation for Dustin Hoffman to pursue a relationship with an older woman, to the sound of Simon & Garfunkel.Hoffman is Benjamin Braddock, the disaffected young university graduate who returns from his studies to a summer without direction. He is swiftly seduced by Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's business partner, and embarks on a lengthy affair, but his affection soon turns to her daughter, Elaine. Yet this is merely the bare bones of the plot it's more complex than a simple romantic comedy, and the ending, notably, is ambiguous.It's impossible to complain about spoilers for a film that came out over forty years ago; it has seeped into popular culture, and been subjected to merciless parody. The iconic ending sequence is especially strange to watch for someone who grew up repeatedly watching Wayne's World 2 (1993), where it is replicated shot for shot.The critical eye has been on the film for so long, and it has passed through so many generations that its contemporary relevance can be questioned. Though a product of the late 1960s, the counterculture elements we associate with the period, such as free love, psychedelia, or hard rock. Benjamin's sexual experiences are not part of a revolution, and he remains trapped firmly within the rigid framework of upper middle class suburbia.While there's a certain fascination to looking back on a snapshot of the past, many of us no longer have the same relationship with our parents and the older generation. Do we look back at a history of steady liberalisation, but no massive social upheaval, and see further subversion as unnecessary? Do our parents, the children of the past, simply provide us with a system we no longer need to escape? Maybe modern youth have it worse than Benjamin; our coming of age is not so straightforward. We are no longer afforded the opportunity of clear rebellion, and are left to wallow in the established structure.What does hold true is the portrayal of a graduate with no clear future, returning to inhabit the fading skeleton of a life that's somehow no longer his own, and the dull resignation that there's little incentive to do anything about it. As a graduate myself (Though my current social circle suffers an absence of attractive lonely women) I can largely sympathise with Benjamin's predicament.After all, what does the immediate future hold? The prospects of the graduate are numerous and varied. Will it be more of the same on a postgraduate course? Are we heading for the city for a mysterious role as an analyst or consultant (when we're really just brewing tea for executives)? Perhaps it's just going to be a couple more months playing video games in pyjamas before we make a final decision.We still need something. A last hurrah before we're thrown to the world of work and responsibility for good. Could the modern rebellion be merely the fabled gap year abroad? At any rate, it seems coming of age requires something extreme, ditching the world and obligations, the way that Benjamin does at the end of The Graduate. The whole film is an exploration of these questions, symbolically relayed through the central relationships.

He is swiftly seduced by Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's business partner, and embarks on a lengthy affair, but his affection soon turns to her daughter, Elaine. Yet this is merely the bare bones of the plot it's more complex than a simple romantic comedy, and the ending, notably, is ambiguous.It's impossible to complain about spoilers for a film that came out over forty years ago; it has seeped into popular culture, and been subjected to merciless parody. The iconic ending sequence is especially strange to watch for someone who grew up repeatedly watching Wayne's World 2 (1993), where it is replicated shot for shot.The critical eye has been on the film for so long, and it has passed through so many generations that its contemporary relevance can be questioned. Though a product of the late 1960s, the counterculture elements we associate with the period, such as free love, psychedelia, or hard rock. Benjamin's sexual experiences are not part of a revolution, and he remains trapped firmly within the rigid framework of upper middle class suburbia.While there's a certain fascination to looking back on a snapshot of the past, many of us no longer have the same relationship with our parents and the older generation. Do we look back at a history of steady liberalisation, but no massive social upheaval, and see further subversion as unnecessary? Do our parents, the children of the past, simply provide us with a system we no longer need to escape? Maybe modern youth have it worse than Benjamin; our coming of age is not so straightforward. We are no longer afforded the opportunity of clear rebellion, and are left to wallow in the established structure.What does hold true is the portrayal of a graduate with no clear future, returning to inhabit the fading skeleton of a life that's somehow no longer his own, and the dull resignation that there's little incentive to do anything about it. As a graduate myself (Though my current social circle suffers an absence of attractive lonely women) I can largely sympathise with Benjamin's predicament.After all, what does the immediate future hold?

Words cannot describe how good Goldfinger is, but I'll try it anyway.Instead of getting a taut Cold War thriller that was From Russia with Love, we get a surprisingly intriguing smuggling\/monetary inflation story. Bond is ordered to trail a German banker named Mr. Goldfinger (played deliciously by Gert Frobe) Goldfinger's number one obsession is obviously gold, so he seeks to increase his stock by destroying the U.S. gold supply located at Fort Knox with a dirty nuclear bomb.Goldfinger is a great larger-than-life villain, but is very restrained n the sense that he just want more gold, which is the great love of his life. He's not trying to take over the world, which to me is a breath of fresh air. The sidekick, Oddjob, is also very memorable. Harold Sokata became world famous for throwing the steel-brimmed hat and silent but menacing performance every henchman has tried to match since.And then we have the ever awesome, ever popular, ever innuendo inducing Pussy Galore, played by Honor Blackman. Hee-Hee, that name, ha ha never gets old. But thats not the only reason why we remember her. She's driven, sassy, smart, but according to the original book, a lesbian, which is why she says, Turn off the charm, I'm immune. I'm not opposed to this, that's actually very unique, but of course Bond easily (well sort of) gets inside and changes her over. Bad James, bad.And then we have pretty good action sequences.

Allen plays Ray, a small time crook, who has served time for robbery, but has not learned his lesson. He formulates another illegal scheme. He tells his long-suffering wife Frenchy, (Tracey Ullman) that this time he knows his plan will work. He and his friends are going to tunnel under a bank and steal the money at night. (Ray is a good safe-cracker, whatever his other inadequacies may be.)Allen surrounds himself with other crooks, all as inept as he is. They argue about whether he was called The Brain in prison because he was smart, or whether the other prisoners were being sarcastic. (We never find out, but I suspect the latter explanation.) Naturally, the plan goes hopelessly awry. However, as a cover for their activity in the building, Frenchy has started a cookie business. In a typically New York kind of response, people love her cookies. They demand her cookies. They will wait endlessly in line for her cookies. Almost instantaneously, the crooks own a multi-million dollar legitimate bakery business.The plot thickens when Frenchy decides that her life style--and her life--need to be commensurate with her new-found wealth. She hires art dealer and cad David (Hugh Grant) to teach her how to be a sophisticated socialite. Naturally, complications ensure. From there, the plot moves forward in predictable--but humorous--ways.Watch for Elaine May as Frenchy's very dim cousin May. (I've noticed this about Woody Allen. In most movies, someone may be perceived as slow in the beginning of the film, but by the end, they have demonstrated true wisdom. Not so for Woody. Start slow, end slow.) The ultimate New Yorker, Elaine Stritch, has a cameo role as socialite Chi Chi Potter. Anyone could have played the part. I think Woody just wanted to have Stritch in the movie to tell us, This is New York, and nowhere else.We saw the film on DVD, and it worked well on the small screen. This is pretty lightweight Woody, but for me, any Woody is worth seeing. So, if you have an hour and a half to spare, check out Small Time Crooks.Personal note Life imitates art. My cousin became a millionaire by franchising chocolate chip cookies. However, he didn't arrive at that career by starting out to rob a bank.

Naturally, the plan goes hopelessly awry. However, as a cover for their activity in the building, Frenchy has started a cookie business.

They no longer matter. &#x96; MagnetoBryan Singer's X-men plagued me with a wealth of interest based on my academic involvement in evolutionary science. It also deals with modern social struggles, superiority complexes among intelligent super-minds, quick-witted one liners and some downright incredible haircuts. This is a fond throwback to one of the key comic book films of all time, which I would argue gave faith to film companies to stick with the genre after some poor efforts in the late 90s.The story is very simple the antagonist, Magneto, has built a machine that can force mutations within human beings, at great cost to the operator's strength. By using the machine, powered by young Marie\/Rogue (infused with Magneto's metal controlling abilities), Magneto will transform several world leaders and dignitaries, who are gathered on Ellis Island NYC for a peace summit, into mutants. Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm and Jean Grey must stop him, as his device is not only deemed immoral by the X-Men, but they have witnessed the potential for it to kill humans who's cells aren't equipped to deal with forced mutation. It is however, the sub-plot of mutant alienation and criminalisation\/ victimisation, and how the mutant characters deal with the shackles placed on them by society, which makes X-Men a complex, original Superhero film, and indeed series.X-men takes real life issues, such as homosexuality and disability, and places them in a surreal world, where mutants are feared by mankind because they are deemed unnatural by key figures in society. Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) is that divisive figure in this film. Seeking to instill a sense of fear of the unknown in the American populous, he suggests that mutants could be dangerous, and are national security liabilities unless they can be registered. This causes a reaction within one particular mutant named Magneto, who is ready to initiate war against humans under the Darwinian theory that a species must adapt, or be replaced by a stronger, fitter one. Rather than forcing an entity of pure evil upon us in Magneto, Singer opens the film by showing the torment and evil that has befallen him under mankind; as a young boy he is separated from his parents in a concentration camp, triggering a dormant powerful mutation within him, along with a burning hatred for human beings. McKellen is the perfect Magneto. A man who has lived a life as a member of an outcast community understood the role perfectly, and was even able to offer help to Singer and his crew, understanding the more subtle social issues behind mutants. Equally convincing is his role as an ego-maniacal would-be-dictator.Unfortunately, Magneto's crew fall far short of the mark in representing what he stands for. Sabretooth doesn't have any dialogue, but offers nothing in the way of body language or facial expression to compensate. Toad makes an excellent, resilient fighter, and brings some comic relief to the Brotherhood, but his character just lacks the seriousness needed to fill the gap for the mute Sabretooth and the quiet Mystique. Mystique's make up is astounding, and her character is sleek and deadly in and out of combat. Although later X-men films focus on her a great deal more, she just doesn't get enough screen time or dialogue in the original film to have any real impact in the way that the lesser X-men do.The X-Men, under the calm, yet powerful guidance of Professor X. (expertly portrayed by Patrick Stewart against McKellen's Magneto), seek to prevent all out conflict between Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants and man, with a goal to help the two understand one another and live harmoniously. The X-men are portrayed faithfully, but just seem a little diluted, which is a shame as some sparks of on screen chemistry are quite visible, particularly between Wolverine and Cyclops. Hugh Jackman really is the perfect candidate for Wolverine, forgiving him a 12 inch height difference. His accent, facial expressions delivery of both snappy one liners (What d' they call you? Wheels?), and confrontational snarls are all in perfect character. Call it teething problems, but his later performances are more naturally aggressive and cantankerous than in this film, but he's easily forgiven, as Wolverine is probably the strongest character alongside Xavier and Magneto.Cyclops and Jean Grey are both competent on screen, but seem to rely (much like the entire franchise at times) on Jackman's Wolverine to help character development. This also holds true for Storm; her moral deliberation with Wolverine in Xavier's mansion is her most prominent non-battle scene moment in the film.Rogue is the final main X-man, though she doesn't become fully fledged in this film. Her character is portrayed as an innocent, misunderstood teenager who has a mutation which leaves her feeling isolated from others of both human and mutant kind. Again, her character clings to Wolverine, but far more closely than any of the others. Several poignant scenes are shared between Paquin and Jackman's characters; indeed, Wolverine is the only one who can soothe Rogue's troubled mind when she is most vulnerable, though she did inadvertently almost kill him twice. She, along with Magneto, embodies the ideologies behind the film isolation, suffering, and alienation from normality.X-men was a very good film for a time when mainstream audiences were disenchanted with the Superhero genre. The expertise of actors such as Jackman, Stewart and McKellen, an inventive plot dealing with issues beyond just fighting bad guys and personal feuds, and, flaws aside, a passable gallery of superheros and villains immersed in a world where regular humans are an active component in the battlefield gave Hollywood something new, and arguably gave birth to the 21st century comic book film explosion.X-men (2000)Allan's Score 6.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 September 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" We are the future Charles, not them.

I thought it was an interesting idea, the action was good, there are some fun characters, and it can be intense in places. However, there are some definite issues I have with the film as well. I have not seen the remake, so I cannot comment on that film.The story is set in an alternate reality where Russia and Cuba have invaded America. The story follows eight high school kids lead by Jed (Patrick Swayze). Their town gets invaded by soviet forces and their parent have been either captured or killed. These eight teenagers form a resistance called The Wolverines, which is named after their football team, and gives the soviets hell. They are also joined later on by a Col. Andrew Tanner (Powers Boothe) who joins their team for a little while.I have seen many war movies as well as TV series now. There are some I enjoy like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers and others I did not care for like The Deer Hunter (yes I said it). Red Dawn I will say is probably one of my favorite war movies now. I like a lot of the characters like Jed and Colonel Andrew. Charlie Sheen is even in this movie playing Jed's younger brother Matt. Charlie looked so young in this and had such a weird hairdo that, at times, I could not even tell it was him. However, I liked his performance as well as the character Matt. The film also has some decent action scenes that will keep you entertained and even at times wish you were one of them.This film is in a way great vicarious entertainment, at least at some parts. Many of us probably fantasized once in our lives about forming a gang of rebels, blowing away enemy forces, and getting praised as legends for doing so. However, the film can also get quite dark in other places especially the end. This film does play into the tragedy of war and the effects it has on people and, in my opinion, it does it quite well. The film does not end on a triumphant note really. It was not ultra-depressing, but it was not the triumphant ending I was expecting.The film does have some faults though. Many of the characters do not get enough character development or screen time. This movie is more about the action and the tragedy of war than on character development, which is fault. Powers Boothe's character Andrew is especially underused. He shows up and joins the main group near the middle and is killed of like fifteen minutes later. I did not care for that because he is my favorite character in the film. Another minor fault is that sometimes the dialog and the acting, particularly from Swayze feels very clunky and unnatural.Overall, Red Dawn is a very underrated war movie and just an underrated film in general. If you are a fan of war movies then give this a look. For those who have seen the remake and see how it stakes-up to you. I've heard nothing but bad things about the remake so my guess is the original is much better.
