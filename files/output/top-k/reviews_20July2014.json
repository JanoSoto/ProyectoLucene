It is my third favorite of the films and a pretty dark and entertaining film.Armando takes Caesar to the city where Caesar witnesses how humans mistreat apes. Caesar curses at a few humans who torture a chimpanzee and Armando takes the blame for it since any ape who can talk would be known to be the offspring of Zira and Cornelius. Eventually Caesar starts to lead a ape rebellion.I like the story and tone of this film. It is set in a cold dark setting so that makes you want to root for Caesar. It is definitely the darkest of the first five ape films and has a lot of parts that might disturb younger audiences. I kind of like how dark it is, I always was a fan of darker films sometimes.Another thing this film has going for it is that Roddy McDowall returns to play Caesar this time. Its cool that he plays Caesar as he also played Cornelius so he is playing his own son. He gives one of his best performances in this film, maybe his best from the apes series. Roddy is always great in these films.Supporting characters are OK. I liked Mcdonalds character as he sympathizes with the apes. Also Ricardo Montalbon is great again as Armando. The rest of the characters are OK. Nothing too special.Towards the end this film has some good action packed scenes. But they really lead up to it and build suspense as you see the apes start rebelling and smuggling weapons.A few complaints. Some of the apes in the background clearly are just wearing masks. Caesar and the main apes look great, but not all of them do. That was probably due to budget restraints though. Also like I said before there are some pretty dark parts that show apes being tortured so I don't think this is the most kid friendly ape film. Its not the worst thing out there, but from the first five it definitely has the most disturbing scenes with torture.Overall I really liked this film. It is dark and that makes it stand out. Roddy McDowall is also great. I recommend it. ","genre":null},{"date":"20 July 2014","score":"","review":" Conquest of the Planet of the Apes is the fourth of the Apes series.

I liked them as a kid but as an adult I love them. Their humor has so much nuance and clever wit that the jokes and characters get better with age. 'Muppet Treasure Island' might just be my favorite Muppet film and that is a hard thing to truly say because the Muppets have so much re-watch ability. I think what I like here is how sincere the story is while exploiting bizarre Muppet humor. It takes an audacity to adapt Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel with Kermit and the gang. The movie is a hoot and I laughed a lot here but at the same time there's a great deal of heart and emotion involved. That's what has always been so wonderful about the Muppets and this swashbuckling adventure is no exception.What's so impressive here is how much integrity the original Stevenson story keeps while adapted in Muppet form. There are no cheap laughs at the expense of Long John Silver or Jim Hawkins. They blend seamlessly into the narrative. While Kermit, Fozzie, Piggy and the gang fill the outer cast and provide us with the classic humor, they never take away from the plot. Kermit is especially good as Captain Smollet. He gets some really heavy character motivation no doubt taken from the Stevenson novel and Kermit relays it very well. As do all the other characters. It doesn't feel out of place or thematically schizophrenic when we go from scenes showcasing the menace of Long John Silver to a rip roaring musical number affectionately called 'Cabin Fever'.Tim Curry is brilliant in this film. His interaction with the Muppets is seamless. In some of the lesser Muppet entries the human actors seem to be making fun of the Muppets (Charles Grodin in 'The Great Muppet Caper' is particularly bad'.) Curry treats them like they are real actors. This seems like it should be a no brainer but it is critical for this story here. Curry's band of buccaneer Muppets are actually quite menacing and some of the scarier creatures in a traditional Muppet film because the interaction is so good. The film isn't just an adaptation of 'Treasure Island' all the great Muppet humor and heart is intact and in some instances as funny as ever. Frank Oz's Fozzie Bear steals every scene he is in as Squire Trelawney(well in actuality the half witted son of Squire Trelawney). I particularly love how they use Gonzo and Rizzo in this film. They become Jim's companions on this voyage.

I liked them as a kid but as an adult I love them. Their humor has so much nuance and clever wit that the jokes and characters get better with age. 'Muppet Treasure Island' might just be my favorite Muppet film and that is a hard thing to truly say because the Muppets have so much re-watch ability. I think what I like here is how sincere the story is while exploiting bizarre Muppet humor. It takes an audacity to adapt Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel with Kermit and the gang. The movie is a hoot and I laughed a lot here but at the same time there's a great deal of heart and emotion involved. That's what has always been so wonderful about the Muppets and this swashbuckling adventure is no exception.What's so impressive here is how much integrity the original Stevenson story keeps while adapted in Muppet form. There are no cheap laughs at the expense of Long John Silver or Jim Hawkins. They blend seamlessly into the narrative. While Kermit, Fozzie, Piggy and the gang fill the outer cast and provide us with the classic humor, they never take away from the plot. Kermit is especially good as Captain Smollet. He gets some really heavy character motivation no doubt taken from the Stevenson novel and Kermit relays it very well. As do all the other characters. It doesn't feel out of place or thematically schizophrenic when we go from scenes showcasing the menace of Long John Silver to a rip roaring musical number affectionately called 'Cabin Fever'.Tim Curry is brilliant in this film. His interaction with the Muppets is seamless. In some of the lesser Muppet entries the human actors seem to be making fun of the Muppets (Charles Grodin in 'The Great Muppet Caper' is particularly bad'.) Curry treats them like they are real actors. This seems like it should be a no brainer but it is critical for this story here. Curry's band of buccaneer Muppets are actually quite menacing and some of the scarier creatures in a traditional Muppet film because the interaction is so good. The film isn't just an adaptation of 'Treasure Island' all the great Muppet humor and heart is intact and in some instances as funny as ever. Frank Oz's Fozzie Bear steals every scene he is in as Squire Trelawney(well in actuality the half witted son of Squire Trelawney). I particularly love how they use Gonzo and Rizzo in this film.

The film is a harrowing and mesmerizing tale of the slow descent into madness and the effects that war can have on one's mind, and it also has the absolute best cinematography that I have ever seen. It is a film that has held its own despite a hellish production and it has become a masterpiece of its time.The production of Apocalypse Now is well known to have been a complete nightmare, with such problems that included Marlon Brando's uncooperative demeanor and weight problems, Martin Sheen's near-fatal heart attack, sets being destroyed by multiple storms, and ever increasing production costs. Production took well over a year to complete and millions of feet of film were edited down to the final product. Despite all of these setbacks, however, the end result is a wonder to behold. The story is uncompromising and harsh and we the viewers can feel Captain Willard's grip on reality slowly fade away as he carries out his journey to find Colonel Kurtz. The masterful cinematography makes the nearly-four-decade old film look and feel brand new. Coppola truly suffered for his craft, but the end result was well worth all the trouble.The film's antagonist, Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, is a very intriguing character despite his short time actually on screen. He is a highly regarded and honored military figure who has gone mad and formed his own kingdom of sorts in the jungles of Cambodia. He has become so powerful that he is even feared by the US military. When we are finally introduced to Kurtz, we learn that the horrors he witnessed and experienced during his time fighting in the war are what created his grim views on human nature and civilization. Kurtz has an almost god-like air about him. The way that he operates and commands his militia throughout the film without his physical presence gives him a mysterious yet powerful quality that make the character feel omnipresent. His back story and his influence over the lead characters even before they come to meet him creates the impression that he is somehow watching and controlling their every move and thoughts and that by the time they finally reach him, he already has some control and insight into their minds. Kurtz is one of the most interesting characters on film that I have yet seen.Overall, Apocalypse Now is truly unforgettable and is one of my favorite films. The philosophical messages of insanity and man's breaking point haunt the viewer for some time, perhaps forever. This is a film that has to be seen to be believed.

It's a pretty average adventure film. But there lies the problem -- it's pretty average.First off, the script seemed hastily done. The general story line was easy enough to follow, but every once in a while I would find myself thinking -- now why was that being done. For example, I'm sure there was a reason for having a British rock & roll technician involved in the story...but the reason escaped me; totally irrelevant to the story line, a distraction.On the other hand, the acting was fine. Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, and Danny DeVito were a charming trio, as we had already learned in the first film. Douglas was just really coming to my attention in a series of 3 films, including this one. I thought he was very promising, and then Fatal Attraction sealed the deal. Kathleen Turner is one of those actresses where when I see her in an old film I remember just how good she was...and then wonder what happened to her (turned out her health sort of defeated her star career). Danny DeVito -- well, he has had his ups and downs in films; I don't feel this is one of his better roles, although I thought the script (or the director) let him down here.

If you watched the first film, you'll want to watch this sequel, but you'll surely decide it isn't the quality of the first. But, it's not okay.

Its one of those films where people love to talk what its about, but have little to say on how it portrays its themes. They say its about conscious, identity, and our dim future...but why should we care?For me, a film must have strong characters to anchor you to the story. They must be realistic and relateable, so you can understand and emphasize with their experiences. But to call GitS's characters two-dimensional is stretching the definition. The story is so focused on the case, we rarely spend any time with the cast, and thus I couldn't care about their interactions or fate. The main character is especially uninteresting when she supposedly undergoes a great change at the end of the film, she's just as wooden as before.The sacrifice of character isn't even worth the sci-fi, cyber mystery thrills. The plot is so bloated with techno-babel its almost incomprehensible. This isn't depth that requires multiple viewings to understand - this is just bad writing. With little emotion attached to the scenes, I barely maintained attention. Only a few action scenes are scattered through the film, and none are worth the wait.I will concede the animation is pretty good, especially the backgrounds. They're cartoons, but dark, detailed, and realistic. You get a decent sense of this advanced, yet dismal world. If only this quality were in a better film! Its easy to deride those against this film as people who just don't get it. I'd say there's nothing important to take away. Its world is barely explored outside of the premise, and the lone conflict between the main character and villain is so bizarre it has no bearing to reality. Imagination and presentation does not equal depth. Ghost in the Shell felt like it needed another 30 minutes to explain things and develop its themes and characters. Its easily one of the worst films I have watched in terms of writing, but at least it looks good, and is a short burn. With the large amount of sci-fi we have access to these days, I wouldn't recommend GitS to anyone.

To understand it today we have to recall that silent movie actors in the 1920s were living legends in the eyes of adoring film fans around the world. Also, at the half-way mark of the twentieth century there were still film studios that employed full-time labor (paying living wages) in a variety of supporting positions, allowing undiscovered talent the opportunity to climb the ranks. There was so much general excitement about Hollywood's contribution to world culture in 1950 that Billy Wilder's depiction of a mentally disturbed, former movie star undoubtedly rankled some of his peers.When Joe Gillis (William Holden) meets Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), both aspire a higher station in Hollywood. Gillis, a hack screenwriter experiencing tough times, is being chased by repo men who want his car. Gillis arrives at Norma's decaying, seemingly unoccupied mansion out of sheer desperation. Gillis is fairly likable, but when given the opportunity he takes what he needs from others. Norma, who surrounds herself with photographs from her youth (i.e., early publicity pics of comely Gloria Swanson﻿), is not well. She spends her days obsessed with the adulation she used to receive and cannot accept the reality that her film career is kaput. (BTW, for six years Gloria Swanson was the leading attraction at Paramount Pictures﻿.) Gillis becomes a kept man, accepting Norma's gifts and eventually becoming her lover. As Gillis rises in stature, it is inevitable that he will want more than he has. Temptation arrives in the form of Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), the youthful script girl and fiancé of Joe's close friend Artie (Jack Webb). Betty aspires to be a screenwriter, wants to team up professionally with Joe, and her eyes light up like firecrackers when she states her intention to do the hard work needed to break through. It is very likely that (director and second-listed screenwriter) Billy Wilder created Betty to represent his dream love. She sure is mine.A very memorable character is Norma's butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim﻿). Max faithfully serves the decaying Norma, maintaining her illusion of aristocracy (that silent film stars knew for real). Max suffers almost unendurably, but never receives any attention for doing so. Regarding that Stroheim had some great success as an actor and a director, this role perfectly submerges him. This is also seen with the cameos by Buster Keaton﻿, Hedda Hopper, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. Considering Keaton's real-life stature as a silent-era superstar, watching the legendary comedian in advanced years quietly playing Bridge in that decrepit room reminds us that Time never plays favorites.This is arguably Billy Wilder's best effort as a director. He does a very good job with the mansion interiors, creating a mysterious and suspenseful feeling. (One quibble with the writing is the name-dropping, particularly early on.) Gloria Swanson should have won an Academy Award for her fearless, often-imitated performance of Norma. William Holden﻿ plays the opportunistic Joe Gillis with complexity. Nancy Olson as Betty is simply adorable. While the cast is very strong overall, I do have some disagreement with the multiple scenes with Cecil B. DeMille﻿ portraying himself which serve to make him appear thoughtful and sensitive to Norma's problems. (Was Billy Wilder trying to kiss DeMille's rear end?)
