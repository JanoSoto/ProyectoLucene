I wasn't even going to see the movie but my conniving and manipulative friend tricked me into seeing it (long story; you wouldn't want to hear it). Needless to say, I did not like the movie, although my 11-year-old brother loved it to death.First of all, let me state a few things. I do have an imagination. I grew up reading Roald Dahl and have seen Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory at least twice. I thought Alice in Wonderland was really cool. I have also seen James and the Giant Peach, among many other adaptations of Roald Dahl's books, and I loved it. I'm looking forward to Lord of the Rings, even though I wouldn't read the books. As for the E.T. thing My mom recommended E.T. to me when one fine night I was at a loss of what to rent at the rental shop. I was reluctant at first, as I thought it was just another kid movie, and I don't usually watch kid movies anymore. I wasn't expecting anything from it but boredom. When the film concluded though, I was in near-tears. In my opinion, by comparing Harry Potter to such classics like E.T. is a tad insulting to the said film. E.T. was something fresh, even in the year 2001; Harry Potter was just trite and recycled.Harry Potter struck me as a mix of The Wizard of Oz and Hercules (you know, the TV show starring Kevin Sorbo?) and just about every other fairy tale you've heard. First, there were the cliches. Of COURSE Harry's a poor, abused boy who lives with wicked foster parents! He simply HAS to be, or there wouldn't be a reason why he's such a supposed expert with wizardry. The opening sequences with Harry's foster family totally reeked of the story of Cinderella (sp?). The mean uncle in Potter is the mean stepmother in Cinderella, and the obnoxious cousin in Potter is the obnoxious stepsisters in Cinderella. I really could've done without that whole sob-story designated to evoke pity in the audience; I have heard it before, and I have heard it told better.Another thing that made me squirm in my seat was its length. Unlike another equally hyped movie, Titanic, 30 minutes of Harry Potter felt like an hour. When I saw Titanic though, I was surprised to find that 3 hours had passed in the darkened theatre; it felt like an hour and a half. I didn't understand -- and still don't -- why they couldn't have just cut to the chase and dump Harry in the dungeon hole to face-off with the bad, evil guy. On second thoughts, I also don't understand why they took almost an hour in getting Harry's butt to his magical school, whatever it's called. It was a good one hour wasted, and if you add that hour to the time they took to unravel the very unexciting events that took place after that, like the Quiddich game or however you spell it, you get almost two hours. Two hours of oh-so-spectacular events that were mostly irrelevant to the actual finding of the socerer's stone. If you don't call that tediously slow-paced, then I'm not sure if we saw the same movie.The boy who played Harry was a terrible mis-cast. I can't imagine how he got the gig in the first place; he has got to be one of the most uninspired child actors I've seen. Even little Anna Paquin in Jane Eyre (sp) shone in comparison to him, and I didn't think she was all that wonderful in it. His acting was flat, dry and at times, laughable (his portrayal of fear towards the end made me laugh out loud), and even more so when he appeared in scenes with Emma Watson (I think that's her name, she played Hermonie, however one spells it) and Draco, whom I deemed as little Count Dracula. I liked only a few things about the movie, and Draco was among them (another person I liked was Oliver Wood, simply because he's a cute Brit). Emma Watson did well, as did the boy who played Ron and Draco. Child actors are capable of doing their jobs right; it all depends on who we're talking about.The other thing I liked was its visual effects. I can hate the rest of it, but if I ever want to see it for a second time (probably due to permanent insanity), then it'd be for the effects. The school was pretty, and the floating spirits thingy inside was kind of cute, if not funny, though I don't know if that was the intention of the film-makers. The scene in the woods was also done pretty well; the entire look of the place gave the scene an almost creepy feeling. But it was destroyed when **spoiler** the half-human half-horse character (I forgot what you call them) came out to save Harry. I was just so reminded of the likes of Hercules that I started laughing. Beside me, my friend went, What the hell? In fact, she did it quite a lot throughout the whole picture.I would definitely not recommend it to anyone I love. But judging from the amount of positive comments on this site, I guess a lot of people are going to like it. One advice though if you're sick of the whole Harry Potter hype, avoid this film like the plague, which was what I intended to do. Trust me, you wouldn't want to see it. It'll just make you want to set fire to its many merchandises even more.

Watching the commentary, I heard Vaughn and Favreau mention that there were subtle references to Swingers sprinkled here and there, but I'm sure I didn't NEED to get those references to enjoy the film.  Don't get me wrong, I liked it to a degree, I definitely didn't loathe it.  You can say this movie is smarter than most comedies in recent years.  However, it drowns in excess.  Of course, it can be most noteworthy for its two-hundred-or-so uses of the f word (in the commentary there's a funny moment where Favreau and Vaughn tally up all the f words used in a two- or three-minute scene which totaled about 43), but that wasn't one of the excesses that bothered me.  First of all, the movie runs for only ninety-five minutes, yet it felt dragging.  This is a not a three-hour epic drama we're talking about!  Well, most of the film is dialogue-driven.  Though I'm not totally against films that are dialogue-driven (Clerks is a good example of a dialogue-driven film that hits the mark), I felt the dialogue in this movie could've been trimmed.  Surprisingly enough, Favreau mentioned doing a lot of editing (originally, he had about two hours and thirty minutes of footage).  There were some funny moments that I just felt would've been funnier if they stopped the scene three minutes earlier and didn't wear it out.  Though I was never totally annoyed by Vaughn's obnoxious character, I did feel somewhat annoyed when he would continue to gab on and on.  I didn't feel the urge to yell Shut up in his ear, but I did feel like nicely telling him, OK...that's enough.  We get it.  The arguments between Vaughn and Favreau do get repetitive.  Early in the film, you want to laugh out loud when they start telling each other off.  But as the film goes on, the conflicts lose their touch, to the point where they seem like two guests on the Jerry Springer show purposely arguing for the sake of arguing.  Plus, I felt Favreau's character was so laid-back that at times it felt as if he was purposely like that so that Vaughn can shoot his mouth and he can get ticked off.  I know he was supposed to be the straight man, but at times he just seems too straight for his own good and you wonder, How the hell did these guys ever become best friends?  I know opposites attract, but this is ridiculous.  Sean Puffy (oh, I'm sorry--it's P. Ditty for anyone who cares) Combs is not the greatest actor.  Wow, I'm surprised!  However, he's only in the film for about twenty minutes and I can't say he ruined the whole movie.  There are some amusing cameos--for example  Sam Rockwell as the flamboyant bellboy.  Faizon Love (who's known for his many supporting roles in such films as Friday and The Player's Club) is very funny as the bulky bodyguard.  Peter Falk is great as Max.  I grew up watching him on Columbo, so it's great seeing him on screen after all these years.  He's still got it!  The hand-held camerawork gets tiring after a while.  I don't want to be cruel, but visually-wise this movie is poorly made.  So we basically have to depend on the energy of the two leads to keep this film pumping.  There are some obvious continuity errors, as well as one shot where you can see the reflection of the boom in the background.I don't want to give away the ending, but I liked how the two characters evolved in the final scene.  I found it amusingly ironic that they played the country song Ace in the Hole during the end credits.  I can say the film ends on a happy note, without feeling forced.  Made is a fairly amusing comedy that just doesn't come together as a whole.  Maybe if the dialogue was sharper and not as repetitive, it would've been a more tightly-knit film.

Plus, I felt Favreau's character was so laid-back that at times it felt as if he was purposely like that so that Vaughn can shoot his mouth and he can get ticked off.

Faizon Love (who's known for his many supporting roles in such films as Friday and The Player's Club) is very funny as the bulky bodyguard.  Peter Falk is great as Max.  I grew up watching him on Columbo, so it's great seeing him on screen after all these years.  He's still got it!  The hand-held camerawork gets tiring after a while.  I don't want to be cruel, but visually-wise this movie is poorly made.  So we basically have to depend on the energy of the two leads to keep this film pumping.

Watching the commentary, I heard Vaughn and Favreau mention that there were subtle references to Swingers sprinkled here and there, but I'm sure I didn't NEED to get those references to enjoy the film.  Don't get me wrong, I liked it to a degree, I definitely didn't loathe it.  You can say this movie is smarter than most comedies in recent years.  However, it drowns in excess.  Of course, it can be most noteworthy for its two-hundred-or-so uses of the f word (in the commentary there's a funny moment where Favreau and Vaughn tally up all the f words used in a two- or three-minute scene which totaled about 43), but that wasn't one of the excesses that bothered me.  First of all, the movie runs for only ninety-five minutes, yet it felt dragging.  This is a not a three-hour epic drama we're talking about!  Well, most of the film is dialogue-driven.  Though I'm not totally against films that are dialogue-driven (Clerks is a good example of a dialogue-driven film that hits the mark), I felt the dialogue in this movie could've been trimmed.  Surprisingly enough, Favreau mentioned doing a lot of editing (originally, he had about two hours and thirty minutes of footage).  There were some funny moments that I just felt would've been funnier if they stopped the scene three minutes earlier and didn't wear it out.  Though I was never totally annoyed by Vaughn's obnoxious character, I did feel somewhat annoyed when he would continue to gab on and on.  I didn't feel the urge to yell Shut up in his ear, but I did feel like nicely telling him, OK...that's enough.  We get it.  The arguments between Vaughn and Favreau do get repetitive.

My first disappointment is that Caan, as the coach, is present mainly as a vehicle to keep the film moving along. He fixes things  when the boys screw up, acts tough, makes appropriate facial expressions... and is basically a one-dimensional character with no depth. Naturally, the film has decided to focus on the lives of the football players, as youth sells.Basically, we pursue the love lives of two jocks.

Unbreakable draws no specific themes from any comic book, so if you don't read comic books, it doesn't matter.

Unbreakable draws no specific themes from any comic book, so if you don't read comic books, it doesn't matter. (This movie is not about the display of superpowers like optic blasts or weather control. This is a dramatic movie, not sci-fi.) It won't effect your knowledge of the movie.  Like any other movie, just go in with an open mind. I'm not a sports agent, but I understood Jerry McGuire.  I'm not a stock broker, but I loved Wall Street.  And I'm not a middle-aged man going through a mid-life crisis, but American Beauty was pure genuis to me. Anyway, you get the point. Secondly, forget all other movies, especially Sixth Sense.  Why do people constantly compare previous movies to their predecessors?  If Spielberg's next  movie after E.T was Saving Private Ryan, would people had held it with such  acclaim?  They are two separate movies, as are these two movies.So forget Sixth Sense, forget all the hype that came with it, forget the ending, and expect nothing from Unbreakable and I promise you'll get more in return than you bargained for.

You'll find yourself lying in bed at night thinking about it, for many reasons. One, because it tackles MANY issues, some biggies too - time travel, destiny, and the existence of God. It's hard not to be challenged by this film. And two, because it is extremely confusing the first time you see it. I don't think you can make a fair judgement on this film until you've seen it at least twice. It is often compared to films such as Rushmore and Fight Club and most often American Beauty, which was my favorite film until I saw Donnie Darko. I feel that Donnie Darko succeeds where American Beauty did not. Don't get me wrong, I love AB, but all the characters except Lester and Ricky seemed one-dimensional, a little superficial, a little cliche. Here in DD we have a large cast and we delve into the characters more personally. DD is quite ambitious, however, and in its attempt to cover all basis, we do feel our minds a little stretched and in some cases a little let down because it does try to do too much.

Traffic is an extremely well done drama that manages to be insightful and thought provoking while at the same time not seeming like a paid advertisement about the danger of narcotics.  The film is about the drug trade between the Mexico and US border.  The plot involves several different story lines.  Michael Douglas plays a newly appointed drug czar who is in charge of fighting the war on drugs but runs into some problems when his daughter gets addicted.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is the unsuspecting wife of a narcotics importer, who only learns of his business after he gets arrested.  Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman are two cops assigned to protect a witness before trail, who also happens to be an importer.  There are several subplots as well but the real eye catcher is the performance of Benicio Del Toro as a corrupt Mexican police officer, which is sure to grab him an Oscar.  That being said, the whole cast practically deserves an Oscar.  There is not one bad performance in the whole film.  It could be said though, that the real star of the film is its director, Steven Soderbergh.  I don't know what it is about this guy but all the critics seem to be in love with him.  Personally I don't think he is all that great.  Sex, Lies and videotape nearly put me to sleep, Out of Sight wasn't anywhere near as good as critics said it was and although I did like The Limey it was by no means one of the years' best.  However earlier this year the director managed to strike a cord with audiences (and of course critics) when he made the mega-grossing Erin Brockovich, putting him on the Hollywood A-list.  Which brings us back to Traffic.  The film has a nice look to it; the scenes in Mexico were all bleached with a yellow tint giving it a very atmospheric feel.  I'm kind of split on the camera work though, which was also done by Soderbergh.  Because he carried the camera instead of using track shots; scenes are often shaky and unprofessional looking.  However you soon get used to this and after 20 minutes you won't even notice it.  It also kind of helps the movie adding a grittier feel to it. Check this one out, it's definitely worth your time.

The scene in question in the scene in which deranged cabbie Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) sits in his filthy apartment, shirt undone, magnum in hand, captivated by an episode of American Bandstand, the barrel of his gun aimed at the young, predominantly black dancers. The obsession and the pain on his face, not out of blind racism as others have commented, but out of jealousy, the fact that the young couples are together and happy. Travis watches the scene alone, his attempt at a relationship with Betsy (Cybill Shepard) pretty much none existent, his loneliness becoming uncontrollable. This scene takes place (if I remember correctly) shortly after the scene in which Travis shoots the robber at the convenience store, his anger and mixed up sense of redemption are seemed to be momentarily healed by the violence, the sense of purpose the almost vigilante assault instated upon him. This is a turning point in the character's life, the calm before the storm if you will, and the music makes this message all the more clear. The words of Jackson Browne in his song Late for the Sky (How long have I been drifting alone through the night), of course Travis is going through as stage of self reflection, the song continues - Awake again I can't pretend\/And I no I'm alone\/And close to the end...

This is the reason Taxi Driver looses none of it's power after nearly thirty years, the character of Bickle has something everyone can identify with, who hasn't felt more alone in the biggest city imaginable, Travis isn't mad, he's just been pushed too far by his feelings, his want to be someone more than the average Joe on the street. Plus the structure of the film works fantastically with Paul Schrader's writing, the continuity changes in Travis' hair style means we have no idea just how long a time period the film takes up, Scorsese's use of repetitious imagery as Travis cruises the streets in the yellow cab, bring home the mundane-ness of the job, his street level photography and composition, as both writer and director trick us into following this at first eccentric and charming character, into one of the most furious blood stained finals ever committed to film.
