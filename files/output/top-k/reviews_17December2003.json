The remake ranks right up there with other atrocities like Robin Hood , Prince of Theives and Psycho.If you don't see how the original movie was a thousand times better than the remake just stick with Jetsons' cartoons.

Though it takes a while to be built on, you get the feeling that Mandolin is really trying to impress an adult audience and build chemistry between the two leads, who both give excellent performances.--Though it does take a while to get to them, the war scenes are exhilarating and action-packed, with fantastic sound and great visual effects.--This film has fantastic cinematography, with beautiful angles of the island and stunning outdoor settings, it really is a treat for the eyes.--I don't think I've ever seen the mandolin instrument before watching this picture, and I really loved it. The music played by Nicolas Cage was stunningly beautiful and the soundtrack must really be worth the money.--John Hurt must be noted for his fantastic performance as Pelagia's (Cruz) father. His moustache-twirling, philosophy spouting performance was effective and picked up the movie when it was down. He ignited the screen.THE BAD--There are many sights we see too many times. Penelope Cruz is ALWAYS out picking berries, and always manages to run into someone or see something important to the plot. Why not just let these divulge into the story instead of making us watch Cruz pick berries in a nice fluffy flower dress? Also, though it is a small complaint, the Italian's singing all the time really does get tiresome.--The film is slow burning and boring in the first hour.

Though it takes a while to be built on, you get the feeling that Mandolin is really trying to impress an adult audience and build chemistry between the two leads, who both give excellent performances.--Though it does take a while to get to them, the war scenes are exhilarating and action-packed, with fantastic sound and great visual effects.--This film has fantastic cinematography, with beautiful angles of the island and stunning outdoor settings, it really is a treat for the eyes.--I don't think I've ever seen the mandolin instrument before watching this picture, and I really loved it. The music played by Nicolas Cage was stunningly beautiful and the soundtrack must really be worth the money.--John Hurt must be noted for his fantastic performance as Pelagia's (Cruz) father. His moustache-twirling, philosophy spouting performance was effective and picked up the movie when it was down. He ignited the screen.THE BAD--There are many sights we see too many times. Penelope Cruz is ALWAYS out picking berries, and always manages to run into someone or see something important to the plot. Why not just let these divulge into the story instead of making us watch Cruz pick berries in a nice fluffy flower dress? Also, though it is a small complaint, the Italian's singing all the time really does get tiresome.--The film is slow burning and boring in the first hour.

John Carpenter's Escape From New York is very much a product of it's time, that when compared to other big budget movies of today, it just won't hold up (at least for the younger viewer who's really not willing to give a low budget movie a chance).  Having a sense of perspective with this film can certainly open you up to it. I was fortunate, I got to see Escape From New York when it first premiered in theatres back in 1981.  John Carpenter was building his reputation, and when Escape was announced, it certainly seemed like a novel concept and more original than anyone really gives it credit for- this sort of thing just wasn't done in 1981, and now so many things that were introduced in this movie seem more par for the course. It's a clever concept a rising criminal population gives birth to a United States Police Force and the idea of turning the entire island of Manhattan into the largest maximum security prison in the world.  Air Force One, on it's way to an important world peace summit, has been hijacked by terrorists with the intent of crashing the plane in Manhattan and taking the President's life.  The President survives, and the United States Police Force comes up with a plan to save his life involving one very special prisoner newly transferred to Manhattan, former Special Force operative-turned-criminal S. D. Snake Plissken.Bringing proper perspective to this, one can see that John Carpenter was very much ahead of his time.  Today, many of the trappings of this movie are pretty standard, but when it was first released, there were things here that just weren't done.  One thing I really admire is just how creative a filmmaker with a very low budget can be, and John Carpenter is one of the very best with a low budget.  Sticking with a low budget, let's Carpenter come in with a pretty uncompromised vision- and it certainly comes through- action, suspense  and comic book sensitivities are all over here, and had Carpenter been working from a larger budget under greater restrictions, you just might not have the film that you have now (and moreso, other movies as they are now- this really is an influence on a lot of other filmmakers).There's a whole lot of visual style here, and again that's pretty amazing when you take into account Carpenter's limited budget.  It is a little eerie to watch it again and see the World Trade Center in such a prominent role in the film- the eerieness continues when the Air Force One is crashed into a building by terrorists.  I love the fact that Carpenter composes and performs most all of the music for his movies (I think his score for Halloween remains one of the best horror movie scores ever made), they drive them right and they're neat signatures in the end.  His score for Escape From New York is a little more varied than some of his other film music, and still just as effective.It's a great cast, with a career-making performance from Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken.  Again, putting this in the proper perspective, this was a big chance in Russell's career at the time- he was still better known for his work in Disney films, and was just starting to break that mold.  Escape From New York cracked that mold entirely and I think Russell himself would be one of the first to say that it shaped his career.  Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Harry Dean Stanton and Carpenter-regulars like Charles Cyphers, Tom Atkins, and Frank Doubleday are all solid here- very definite character types, pretty two-dimensional, but that doesn't matter, they drive the story.  One can really see that Isaac Hayes was definitely in to his part as the Duke of New York, Donald Pleasance genuinely invested something in his performance as the President of the United States.  And it was very nice to see both Carpenter's and Russell's wives, Adrienne Barbeau and Season Hubley in this film.  Hubley's scene is brief, but very well done.  Barbeau is in this significantly more, and she was simply the stuff of dreams then (not taking anything away from her now either), and it's a very confident performance (I just love watching her face down the Duke's car at the very end). I just bought the new Special Edition DVD and it's a lovely package.  Although I haven't been able to go through all of the contents yet, one of the must-see (or in this case must-hear) features is the commentary track from John Carpenter and Kurt Russell.  I understand that this is from the original laserdisc, so while there's a certain amount of perspective in their commentary, it's not the same as it would be today (especially after the events of 9-11).  It's a very enjoyable commentary from two guys who had great memories of this film and who obviously love to work together.  Carpenter is quite specific and very telling in all aspects of the film (some of those 3D computer graphics aren't 3D computer graphics- the flythrough of New York?  Black boxes with green lines painted on them... and yet it still looks cool)-  as much as I admired his skills before, after listening to the commentary, I admire them even more. Escape From New York is a wonderful piece of work.  It's an important film in the career of a visionary filmmaker and an important film for one of today's better known leading men.  Those of us who are older and experienced this way back when, will certainly appreciate it's craft, now more than ever.  For younger viewers though, you definitely need a sense of perspective with this- trying to hold it too the same standards as you would a movie made today is hardly fair, and you're just doing yourself a disservice by not opening yourself a little further.

To me it just seemed like another of the war movies coming out post 9\/11.Then I saw the History Channel Documentary and it made me want to see the movie that much more. So I waited until the DVD came out and bought it.It was the best 20 bucks I've ever spent, I've probably seen this movie close to a hundred times by now and I always find something new and interesting.I have to admit I'm not your stereotypical war movie fan, I couldn't watch Saving Private Ryan, and the only two other war movies I'd enjoyed were Das Boot and Stalag 17. I'm also female.But for some reason this movie hit home, probably because I'm old enough to remember the battle of mogadishu. Most of the complaints I seem to see about this movie are 1 There's no charachter development, honestly in the midst of war all soldiers look the same, and there are people you feel for when they die, Jamie Smith, Ruiz, Dom Pilla.2 the lack of political commentary, this wasn't a documentary about the entire war, this was a movie about one day, and the things that happened during that day.The battle scenes were realistic because most of them were filmed practically instead of with digital effects. The acting was great, especially Sizemore, Hartnett, and Johnny Strong who played Shugart. William Fichtner sticks out in my mind because of how well he potrayed Delta Operator Sanderson, as does Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom.What really impressed me was they managed to really convey just how loud a convoy of armored tanks can be, I live ten miles from the School of Hard Knox (Ft. Knox) the premier tank training facility in the us army and most days I wake up to the sound of tanks roaring across the landscape.All in all it was a great movie. Maybe my favorite of all time because it showed that yes war is cold and unforgiving. And you don't know what you're going to do until that first bullet wizes past your head.

I read the short synopsis in the cinema foyer and thought, This sounds ok- let's give it a shot.I was slightly put off near the start of the movie by the family dinner scene. First, we have it rather badly shoehorned into the dialogue that Donnie is on medication, and closely followed by some look how big and clever we are swearing (before you get your back up, allow me to point out that one of my very favourite films is Goodfellas...). Uh-oh, it looks like this is going to be a film version of a teenager's diary.Sure enough, while there were some cracking moments in the dialogue (I'm sure we've all seen Bonanza) and some genuinely stylish ideas (Donnie 'seeing' worm-like forms emitting from people's chests), there were also the well-worn gags about late 80s TV evangelists; self indulgent moaning about how 'nobody understands'; the frankly embarrassingly written discussion about the sexuality of the Smurfs (cinematically, a pathetic and childish attempt at the Royal With Cheese scene from Pulp Fiction); and quasi-surreal characters like Frank the Rabbit- surreal and amusing to the sort of people who think Avril Lavigne is Alternative, no doubt.I think the point where I really started to lose patience was when the psychiatrist pleads with Donnie, saying there's no way he could possibly not believe in any higher power or that there is no point to life. Could it be that Richard Kelly is emphasising Donnie's teenage worries that nobody understands- not even somebody who should remain impartial like a psychiatrist, or is it, as I suspect, just uninformed, melodramatic nonsense?Now to the ending. Surely the reason I don't like this film is because I don't understand it. Wrong. This ending is a cop out. It is not ambiguous in order to enhance the film or inspire the audience. It is ambiguous because the writer has painted himself into a corner and can't think of any other way to get out of it. The ending to Kubrick's 2001 enhances the film.

Perhaps this reflects my assertion that this is like a celluloid teenager confused; moody; attention seeking; and annoying.Richard Kelly has produced some interesting ideas with this film. However, as a Director and especially as a Writer, he needs to mature in his work a lot more. A hell of a lot more.

They mention lack of action, dialogue, or even character development. I think that these people go to a ballet and find it really boring as well. This movie is a ballet of visual arts. The character development happens within the incredible cinematography, designs, sets, and everything else around. It is one of those movies you can call artsy in that respect, where a person doesn't have to answer each question with a yes or no, but simply with the appropriate look, gesture, or even silence. To those of us who understand what subtlety is, it speaks volumes. To those who rely on effects simply to enhance the story, you're in for a boring ride go and rent T2 or something.Blade Runner is beautiful. Like 2001, it has very little dialogue, and like 2001, some people just don't get it. That's fine, but then try to understand what it is you're tearing apart before you do so. Not all visionary things have to have tons of explosions and non stop action. Some of them are very slow paced and force you to think and read between the lines. Like 2001, it doesn't give you the answers, but merely guides you into thinking about them. It creates an entire future to set the appropriate questions so that you can think about them more clearly. Some people think that this might be boring and really need their hands held a little more often, which is why the overlay dialogue was originally put in. But if you want to see a masterpiece, look at the director's cut. It becomes less of a movie than a meditation. Yes, it's slow, but it's meant to be slow. I don't see anyone saying that Swan Lake should be performed faster and that more explanation should be used instead of visual arts. Some people are critical of the ambiguity of Ford's character, but that was meant to be that way for a very good reason. You just have to watch and think carefully about it. In so many ways, this movie is like a dream about ourselves and our future; if you fidget and try to wake up too soon, you'll miss the entire point.

The character development happens within the incredible cinematography, designs, sets, and everything else around. It is one of those movies you can call artsy in that respect, where a person doesn't have to answer each question with a yes or no, but simply with the appropriate look, gesture, or even silence.

To those who rely on effects simply to enhance the story, you're in for a boring ride go and rent T2 or something.Blade Runner is beautiful. Like 2001, it has very little dialogue, and like 2001, some people just don't get it. That's fine, but then try to understand what it is you're tearing apart before you do so. Not all visionary things have to have tons of explosions and non stop action. Some of them are very slow paced and force you to think and read between the lines. Like 2001, it doesn't give you the answers, but merely guides you into thinking about them. It creates an entire future to set the appropriate questions so that you can think about them more clearly. Some people think that this might be boring and really need their hands held a little more often, which is why the overlay dialogue was originally put in.

","genre":"Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"17 December 2003","score":"10 out of 31 people found the following review useful","review":"  And not the facts, you'll love this film.  Stone borrows allegations from several prominent theorists and presents them as if they are unimpeachably true.  He also makes up things of his own and throws them in, and you don't know who made up what.  The problem, to me, is that this film is presented as a historical movie.  You expect some errors and dramatic license in those, and those do exist.  But Stone takes the time (3 hours) and style to make JFK seem like a carefully reconstructed docudrama, which it's not.  The 100 Errors in JFK page aside, there are numerous errors in logic made by Stone, and the fictions stand next to the facts.That's my big problem with the film not that it pushes theories that are totally false, which it does, but that it relies on the ignorance of its audience to get by.  If conspiracy theories weren't so much more popular than the truth, I think a lot of  people would have been unable to stomach the way Stone attacks dead people who are innocent but unable to defend themselves, like Clay Shaw and David Ferrie.  I found myself disgusted by the way they were treated in the film.  They're not fictional characters, they were real people, and Stone is making a buck off the fact that millions of people have been fooled into thinking they murdered John F. Kennedy.  Most of that fooling was done by Jim Garrison and his whacko crusade, and by guys like Fletcher Prouty, who were heavily involved with the film.  Garrison isn't a hero, and he doesn't deserve the treatment he gets either.  I wish I could evaluate the film more on its own merits- it's dramatic, if overlong.  I enjoyed Donald Sutherland's scenes despite my disagreement with their point.  As a film, it's a mixed bag, with some strong points and some weak ones.  As history, it's worse than bad, it's outright dishonest.
