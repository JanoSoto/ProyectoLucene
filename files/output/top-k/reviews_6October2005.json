[{"date":"6 October 2005","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Okay, everybody's bashed the hell out of this movie. It was pretty awful but had some redeeming things. I liked the action. I bought the book twentysomething years ago. On the cover, it said, Soon to be a major motion picture!. It took Travolta's clout. I'm happy for him and it looks like he had a good time as the greedy Terl. The extras on the disk are kinda iffy. Two mini-featurettes are mostly outtakes from the 15 minute making of. Man, everybody had high hopes for this. The director came highly recommended from George Lucas. The effects were well done. The make-up was interesting. Why was Travolta sort of normal looking and the other, lesser Psychlos covered with make-up? I know, he's a superstar and all but come on. Interesting story of Mankind's buttkicking at the hands of some very corporate minded aliens. Imagine if they had been combat oriented like Larry Niven's Kzinti. These tall, hairy, dentally challenged dudes are all about making a buck. And they really get off on screwing each other over, too. The bad guys are there for a 1000 years and don't bother checking EVERYTHING on the planet. They love gold but don't know about Fort Knox. So, yeah, there were some real groaners. I liked good ol' Carlo though. Carlo! You magnificent bastard! He blowed up real good.

It's invariably no good, but it's a good opportunity to do homework for other classes or study. However, when she told us we were going to be watching SELENA the next day, all the girls who'd seen it seemed excited. I know enough not to trust their judgement (these are people who's favorite movies include Napolean Dynamite and Cinderella Story).I was right. I was interested in Selena, the person, when our teacher told us about her. The movie, however, was extremely clichéd. Jennifer Lopez's acting was terribly overdone. The movie held every clichéd scene from movies ever, which I realized from the moment we had a shot of Jennifer staring sadly at a couple kissing, with that look 'oh poor me, I have no one.' What follows is a corny string of scenes such as the I'm sick of everyone telling me what I want and the forbidden love with the line But I love him, Daddy! J.LO shouted a lot. When rewinding it to find the right place, we played in four times to check; she was crying in three of them.The writing even stooped as low as We got married and it's okay with everybody! followed by I feel like I could fly! I feel like I AM flying.The guy who played Selan's father gave the best performance. The best I can say about J.Lo is she looked gorgeous...so much better then the slutty look she has today. I enjoyed the music in the movie (Which i understand was J.Lo lip-synching to the real Selena) and the end footage of the real Selana was nice. Half the people in my class loved it...that would be the other teenage girls. Not the worst way to spend a day in class, but I wouldn't watch it outside of the classroom.
