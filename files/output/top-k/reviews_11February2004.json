We also have Mary Steinberg and Jeff Goldblum who give their all into their characters, I just think they were not that well developed enough. They could have had a little more.The movie starts off with a mother and father rushing into labor, only on the way, unfortunately is struck by listening in a massive thunderstorm. She does not survive, but the baby does and the father is not only devastated but rejects his son. Sean plays Jeremy or as most people call him, Powder due to him being an albino. He is hidden in his grandparent's basement and has never been out of the house. When his grandmother passes, Jessica Caldwill, played by Mary Steinberg, convinces Jeremy that he must leave and they'll give him and home and school to attend. He does leave and slowly progresses towards what he thinks may be a better life.When Donald Ripley, a school teacher, has the I.Q. results for Jeremy for his school, he is amazed. There is no score high enough for Jeremy, he's smarter than Albert Einstein. He can memorize book pages word for word, he knows agonizing math problems, and knows the pain of the world. He also has a mysterious power where he if he is exposed to electricity, he gets electrocuted. He also has the power to make people feel the same pain as they inflicted unto another, he also can read minds. Unfortunately, this isn't making him very popular with the jocks of the school who brutally torment him not just mentally but physically. There is only really Donald, Jessica, and another girl Lidnsey who want to be his friends. Only he's just not willing to except this world of pain when so many people doubt and torture him like Doug Barnum who is the town's sheriff and just thinks Jeremy is a freak. His wife is unfortunately dying and comes to Jeremy to ask for a favor and to help him find out what his wife wants. This scene is so extremely touching and tearful. The scene that got to most to me is when the boys go on a hunting trip and the coach shoots a deer for sport and are just laughing at this poor deer dying. Jeremy then takes his hand on the deer and his other hand on the coach and the coach starts to have somewhat of a seizure, and he made the coach feel the same pain he put on the deer. Poetic justice and well deserved I thought.Powder, despite being depressing, is a pretty decent picture worth viewing if you are in the mood for a sappy flick. But trust me, it is worth the it, you get a great performance that deserved more praise by Sean, also the same with Mary and Jeff.

If not, turn in your headset for a heart.Audrey Tautou is Amélie, a fashion-sharp Parisian waitress with an impish heart of gold and an shyness born of a bizarrely restricted childhood. She is cute and innocent, but not too innocent.Her father, who was a physician, thought she had a defective heart because every time he put the stethoscope to her little chest it was beating wildly.A voice-over explains that this was caused by the excitement that Amélie felt because her frigid father, whom she wanted so much to hold her, although he never did, was actually touching her. Because of an imagined heart condition she is kept out of school and tutored at home.After her mother dies from being hit by a falling body (an actual human body on its way to the pavement from a tall building) we are flash-forwarded to the present where we find little Amélie all grown up. She still has no love in her life. But one day while listening to a news report of the death of Princess Di she drops something on the floor of her apartment. It rolls against a tile in the bathroom, dislodging the tile. Amélie pulls down the tile and finds in a hole in the wall a little tin box full of a boy's childhood mementoes from many years ago. In a characteristic bit of inspiration she decides to find that little boy, now grown into middle age, and give him the box. But she is shy and so must invent a stratagem. She arranges to call him when he is near a public phone booth in which she has placed the box. So delighted with the joy she has given him, Amélie sets off on a series of inventive and pixie-like intrusions into the lives of others in order to bring them happiness and even love.While this R-rated fantasy would delight children there is too much actual sex in it for most American moms to tolerate for their little ones. In fact in the French style sex is made innocent, and of course that will not set well with those of a prudish nature.Favorite corny pun Even artichokes have hearts. Favorite elaborate joke sending her father's garden gnome on the world tour that he won't take himself, and having the gnome photographed at tourist sites and the photos sent airmail to a very perplexed dad. Favorite joke the beggar refusing a handout saying he takes Sundays off. Favorite scheme reconstructing through cut and paste and photocopy the words of the landlady's beloved, and then fashioning a last love letter to her from him that was lost in the mail for forty years. The two disc set includes a wealth of information to delight afficionados. There's an interview with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, some footage on how Amélie was made, filmographies of cast and crew, audition footage, etc., etc.Bottom line very funny, heart-warming and strikingly original.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Occasionally, we were able to go to the matinee at a walk-in theater, but that was the exception rather than the rule.  There was only one occasion that I recall my mother having ventured into a regular movie theater.  That time was during a re-release of Gone With The Wind.  I knew that for her to do something so out of the ordinary would take an extraordinary event.  Because it was her all time favorite film which she had often spoken of, there was no doubt that Gone With The Wind was an exceptional film in her eyes.  The question that remains is whether it would be such a prodigious event for me.I enjoyed my first viewing of Gone With The Wind.  It didn't bore me.  Yet, I hardly remember it being unforgettable which is understandable when you're thirteen years old.  I tried reading Margaret Mitchell's novel once and believe I made it more than half way through.  It was not until years later after having viewed the film several more times that I began to appreciate the epic grandeur of Selznick's film.Many have classified Gone With The Wind as a love story told against the backdrop of the Civil War.   I think that is an oversimplification.  Though, there is a love story involved, this is strictly a film about a woman, who happens to want a man she can't have, but ends up with those men who suit her purpose to further her needs.  Scarlett O'Hara is on the surface, a spoiled rich Southern belle.  In the barbecue at Twelve Oaks, we find her conniving schemes to corral Ashley Wilkes almost humorous.   As the film progresses, and the brutality of the Civil War and its aftermath, envelop the South,   we see changes take place in Scarlett as well.  As she matures into womanhood, Scarlett remains the conniving schemer, but becomes an extremely complex character also.  Until the war, her conniving is strictly that of a lovesick teenager.  After the war her schemes are those of a woman hardened by the brutality of a vicious war, and her plans serve a distinct and powerful purpose.  We may not agree with what she does or how she does it, but we understand her motivations.To bring Scarlett to life on the screen, Selznick chose Vivien Leigh.  Whether it was pure luck or fate it doesn't matter.  I can think of no other actress who could have possibly fitted the role as well as Leigh does.   If I had to name the top ten performances by an actress in a film ever, Leigh would certainly be in the top ten if not at the top of the list.Rhett Butler is the male version of Scarlett in many ways.  At one point in the film Rhett brings this fact up himself. `Because we're alike - bad lots both of us, selfish and shrewd, but able to look things in the eyes and call them by their right names', he states.  He loves Scarlett, yet for most of the film she is out of his reach.  Only when it suits her purposes, does Scarlett give in to him.  She marries him not for love but for fun.  She may indeed love Rhett, because she is stubborn and self-centered, Scarlett can't acknowledge it.  Just as Vivien Leigh is the only actress I can picture as Scarlett, Clark Gable is the definitive Rhett.  There is no denying the chemistry between Rhett and Scarlett when these two great actors are on the screen together.  I have seen many of Gable's films, and have never seen him as good as he is in Gone With The Wind.If the film has one flaw for me in the acting department, it's Leslie Howard's Ashley Wilkes.  Although Ashley is a noble character, he is weak and wishy washy.  He is unable to tell Scarlett his true feelings one way or the other, yet is able to fight nobly for the Confederacy.  Howard manages to convey the indecisiveness and the weaknesses of the character, yet he fails to do anything to have us believe there is a reason why someone as strong willed as Scarlett might find him remotely attractive.Melanie Hamilton Wilkes epitomizes the example of pure goodness and greatness that one could only hope to achieve in life.  Yet, she sees in Scarlett a zest for living that seems to be unattainable to herself.  Because of this and the fact that she finds it difficult to find the evil in anyone, Melanie is blinded to Scarlett's love for Ashley.  Olivia de Havilland gives us a Melanie every bit as real as Rhett and Scarlett.Of all the characters in Gone With The Wind, Mammy is the one who is shrewd enough and smart enough to see everyone for what they really are.   It is a fact that continually infuriates Scarlett.  Hattie McDaniel's  Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of  Mammy may be the most deserving of all.  When she is on the screen, her presence overshadows that of even Leigh.For all of Selznick's attention to detail, for all the grandeur of the Southern Plantations, for the incredible scenes of the burning of Atlanta and the long back wards crane shot of the thousands of wounded soldier lying in the streets, without the complex characters, and the incredible performances by the actors to portray them, Gone With The Wind would quite possibly have never achieved the historical significance that it has.

My Grade A+             ","genre":"Drama, History, Romance"},{"date":"11 February 2004","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is a 3-hour film about a handful of Americans' experience of the Viet Nam war and it did not work for me. Well okay, the simplistic message of War is hell worked but that should not take 3 hours and an expensive cast like Robert de Niro and a young Meryl Streep to explain. I conclude that this film was put together when the US was still in shock after the retreat from Nam, and this is why the technically perfect cinematography is almost incoherent in showing the history that later films have visited with greater depth and honesty.SPOILERS AHEAD! Here I tick off the things you do not get in The Deer Hunter. Although the early seventies were a period of intense political confrontations, fed by a generation (my own) in revolt, there is no trace of political awareness in this movie. There is not a war protester, nor a TV clip of a president or a general in sight. It is strange to see our guys docilely prepared to do their duty by going to Viet Nam, because by now it is standard to show the we're going to war euphoria with bombastic speeches along the lines of You'll make your Dad proud, son and It'll be over as soon as we kick butt. But there is nothing like that.A whole half of a long film is still a long time, and I don't know why The Deer Hunter spends its whole first half showing us the wedding of these people in Philadelphia who all seem to be Russian Orthodox, without looking or sounding like any Russians that I know. This seems just to show us impressively ornate cathedral interiors and the ceremony, followed by a sloppy wedding party with too much drinking that doesn't endear any of the characters to me. Allow me to hammer once more at the political blindness here this was the time of the Cold War, the Soviet Union was the adversary allegedly facing the US in Viet Nam, but do our Americans of Russian extraction have anything to say about this? Not here, it seems.If you expect scenes of army enlistment, boot camp training, military drilling or transport, forget it. You need to watch Full Metal Jacket instead of this film. What happens here is that the narrative cuts abruptly away from the US to a Vietnamese village where our guys are badly pinned down and under bombardment. Obviously we have arrived at the bit that is to show that War Is Hell. After the expenditure of 90 minutes of film stock, lavish Philadelphia scenes and my own viewing time, I feel cheated by the war experience simulated by just a few thatched huts as props, some explosions, the same pair of helicopters used repeatedly and one Vietcong soldier!The film is embarrassingly unable to show Vietnamese in any realistic way. Vietnamese are either sadistic Vietcong who hold our guys as prisoners in nearly submerged cages, or throngs of refugees who block the road (and seem to have a standard-issue conical peasant headgear). In short, the Vietnamese are all either victims or gooks, and I apologise for using that g-word which is regarded as insulting today, but does represent the prevailing attitude of many Americans at that time. The Vietnamese that appear do shout a lot, but there is never a subtitle to show what they say.The sadistic captors that hold our guys both shout a lot and are incredibly stupid. Our guys are not too bright either, and let themselves be forced to play Russian roulette for the guards' gambling entertainment. That means them putting a loaded gun in the hands of a prisoner who has nothing to lose. Bad idea. Robert de Niro cheats and shoots the guards instead, and our guys make their escape by floating down river on a log. From my in-depth studies of wartime conditions in Viet Nam, i.e. I've watched the Rambo films, I judge the prison cages as believable, and the Vietcong's orgy of gambling without proper lookouts in the middle of a war zone as unbelievable. Unfortunately the Russian roulette theme recurs later; the whole Russian connection in this film seems unhelpful and senseless.Our guys only have to float down river a little way and good guys arrive in helicopters to pick them up. Since our 3 guys are in indistinguishable uniforms, and later documentaries tell us about the tendency of Nam-era helicopter door-gunners to shoot anything that moved (If a gook runs it is a Vietcong, if a gook doesn't run it is a disciplined Vietcong.) this arrival of the cavalry is unconvincing. It is also clumsy because two of the 3 guys fall back in the river, and the helicopter deserts them for no obvious reason.One guy, Nick, is by now in a bad way with what seems to be a projecting fracture of the femur. Nick gets taken off to hospital and Robert de Niro is now on his own. We see him next in a sleazy bar in Saigon (surely the go-go dancers and local bar people are Thaïs, not Vietnamese?). On his way out he is accosted by a strange Frenchman who drags him repeating But I insist into a gambling den that he seems to run, where the object of the gambling is, guess what, Russian roulette. If you have followed the story this far, you will believe anything.Two of our guys get back to Philadelphia, USA, and here is where any film like this one about the US experience in Viet Nam has a duty to confront the homecoming catharsis, not least the less than heroic reception given to the veterans. From that viewpoint The Deer Hunter fails again. Our returning soldiers are emotionally stunted by their experience, but the planned welcoming party is all smiles (and there is a line like Didn't we really win out there? which seems unforgivably stupid). Nick is absent until he is tracked down as a wheelchair-bound paraplegic in a vet's hospital, where he would rather stay than come home. But skimming the surface of the problem in this way, in the last reel of the film, is just not good enough.The title itself, The Deer Hunter refers to a theme that seemed wasted to me. Before going to Viet Nam, our guys liked to drive into the mountains and shoot deer. After returning from Nam, Robert de Niro doesn't want to shoot a deer any more. That's all, just that. There is no other development of this trivial theme that I could see!I speculate about why The Deer Hunter was so disappointing. One reason is the far greater honesty, particularly in depicting the Vietnamese, of later films about Viet Nam that I have mentioned here. The Deer Hunter was filmed only shortly after the US retreat from Saigon. That means the makers had limited or no access to the true location or participants. Everything would have to be set up with props, and possibly they tried to follow a vague formula for how a US military experience in a hostile land should be. For example the sadistic guards could have stepped directly out of a war movie set in a Japanese or German WWII POW camp.The actual US retreat is shown with much use of extras to show the chaos in and around the US embassy (and the very unlikely return of de Niro to Saigon to track down the weird Frenchman, and through him the gambling den where Nick somehow has survived continuous rolls at Russian roulette while being catatoNick - the Devil made me type that awful pun), again without saying anything that should have been said, which is sadly the habit of this film. I turned to my viewing partner and  commented that a couple of clips of the helicopter hovering over the Saigon embassy were real-life news clips, and she asked How do you know that? My answer is that those scenes are forever burned into the psyche of the US generation that served, or could have served, in the Viet Nam war.Given the early date of the making of The Deer Hunter, and the political correctness that may have hampered its makers, I may have criticized unjustly here a film that was in its way starting to break down mental barriers of denial about the Viet Nam era. Just the showing of veteran's hospital crammed with wheelchair patients would give some people pause for thought, although I think it was unnecessary and even condescending to show their prolonged bingo game.

From that viewpoint The Deer Hunter fails again.

Nick is absent until he is tracked down as a wheelchair-bound paraplegic in a vet's hospital, where he would rather stay than come home. But skimming the surface of the problem in this way, in the last reel of the film, is just not good enough.The title itself, The Deer Hunter refers to a theme that seemed wasted to me. Before going to Viet Nam, our guys liked to drive into the mountains and shoot deer. After returning from Nam, Robert de Niro doesn't want to shoot a deer any more. That's all, just that. There is no other development of this trivial theme that I could see!I speculate about why The Deer Hunter was so disappointing. One reason is the far greater honesty, particularly in depicting the Vietnamese, of later films about Viet Nam that I have mentioned here. The Deer Hunter was filmed only shortly after the US retreat from Saigon. That means the makers had limited or no access to the true location or participants. Everything would have to be set up with props, and possibly they tried to follow a vague formula for how a US military experience in a hostile land should be. For example the sadistic guards could have stepped directly out of a war movie set in a Japanese or German WWII POW camp.The actual US retreat is shown with much use of extras to show the chaos in and around the US embassy (and the very unlikely return of de Niro to Saigon to track down the weird Frenchman, and through him the gambling den where Nick somehow has survived continuous rolls at Russian roulette while being catatoNick - the Devil made me type that awful pun), again without saying anything that should have been said, which is sadly the habit of this film. I turned to my viewing partner and  commented that a couple of clips of the helicopter hovering over the Saigon embassy were real-life news clips, and she asked How do you know that? My answer is that those scenes are forever burned into the psyche of the US generation that served, or could have served, in the Viet Nam war.Given the early date of the making of The Deer Hunter, and the political correctness that may have hampered its makers, I may have criticized unjustly here a film that was in its way starting to break down mental barriers of denial about the Viet Nam era. Just the showing of veteran's hospital crammed with wheelchair patients would give some people pause for thought, although I think it was unnecessary and even condescending to show their prolonged bingo game.

Well okay, the simplistic message of War is hell worked but that should not take 3 hours and an expensive cast like Robert de Niro and a young Meryl Streep to explain. I conclude that this film was put together when the US was still in shock after the retreat from Nam, and this is why the technically perfect cinematography is almost incoherent in showing the history that later films have visited with greater depth and honesty.SPOILERS AHEAD! Here I tick off the things you do not get in The Deer Hunter. Although the early seventies were a period of intense political confrontations, fed by a generation (my own) in revolt, there is no trace of political awareness in this movie. There is not a war protester, nor a TV clip of a president or a general in sight. It is strange to see our guys docilely prepared to do their duty by going to Viet Nam, because by now it is standard to show the we're going to war euphoria with bombastic speeches along the lines of You'll make your Dad proud, son and It'll be over as soon as we kick butt. But there is nothing like that.A whole half of a long film is still a long time, and I don't know why The Deer Hunter spends its whole first half showing us the wedding of these people in Philadelphia who all seem to be Russian Orthodox, without looking or sounding like any Russians that I know. This seems just to show us impressively ornate cathedral interiors and the ceremony, followed by a sloppy wedding party with too much drinking that doesn't endear any of the characters to me. Allow me to hammer once more at the political blindness here this was the time of the Cold War, the Soviet Union was the adversary allegedly facing the US in Viet Nam, but do our Americans of Russian extraction have anything to say about this? Not here, it seems.If you expect scenes of army enlistment, boot camp training, military drilling or transport, forget it. You need to watch Full Metal Jacket instead of this film. What happens here is that the narrative cuts abruptly away from the US to a Vietnamese village where our guys are badly pinned down and under bombardment. Obviously we have arrived at the bit that is to show that War Is Hell. After the expenditure of 90 minutes of film stock, lavish Philadelphia scenes and my own viewing time, I feel cheated by the war experience simulated by just a few thatched huts as props, some explosions, the same pair of helicopters used repeatedly and one Vietcong soldier!The film is embarrassingly unable to show Vietnamese in any realistic way. Vietnamese are either sadistic Vietcong who hold our guys as prisoners in nearly submerged cages, or throngs of refugees who block the road (and seem to have a standard-issue conical peasant headgear). In short, the Vietnamese are all either victims or gooks, and I apologise for using that g-word which is regarded as insulting today, but does represent the prevailing attitude of many Americans at that time. The Vietnamese that appear do shout a lot, but there is never a subtitle to show what they say.The sadistic captors that hold our guys both shout a lot and are incredibly stupid. Our guys are not too bright either, and let themselves be forced to play Russian roulette for the guards' gambling entertainment. That means them putting a loaded gun in the hands of a prisoner who has nothing to lose. Bad idea. Robert de Niro cheats and shoots the guards instead, and our guys make their escape by floating down river on a log. From my in-depth studies of wartime conditions in Viet Nam, i.e. I've watched the Rambo films, I judge the prison cages as believable, and the Vietcong's orgy of gambling without proper lookouts in the middle of a war zone as unbelievable. Unfortunately the Russian roulette theme recurs later; the whole Russian connection in this film seems unhelpful and senseless.Our guys only have to float down river a little way and good guys arrive in helicopters to pick them up. Since our 3 guys are in indistinguishable uniforms, and later documentaries tell us about the tendency of Nam-era helicopter door-gunners to shoot anything that moved (If a gook runs it is a Vietcong, if a gook doesn't run it is a disciplined Vietcong.) this arrival of the cavalry is unconvincing.

The fact that admission was seventy-five cents when normally one could see a double feature for thirty-five cents as a kid was not lost on me either.   It meant my sister was treating me to something special and as it turned out it was most assuredly all of that and then some. Films we view when we are young do not always hold the same appeal for us as we grow older.  As a youngster, I remember being fascinated by many films that I can hardly stand to sit through as an adult.  I loved anything with Jerry Lewis in it, yet there are less than a handful of his films I now find entertaining.   There were countless cheaply made horror films that scared the living daylights out of me that I laugh at now.  There were children films such as Pinocchio in Outer Space, even one with a mouse called Topo Gigio that are now long forgotten.  There are two films however that made an impression on me more than any others at an early age.  The first was the Cinerama presentation of How The West Was Won, the second was Mary Poppins.  The question is whether or not I can view them in a favorable light as an adult.   I still enjoy How The West Was Won, but it has never had the impact on me as it did in Cinerama.   Today I viewed Mary Poppins again for the first time in a number of years and I can say that without question it is every bit as magical as it was back in 1965 when I first saw it.What is there not to like?  The story has heart, warmth, memorable characters, wonderful musical numbers, and a heaping dose of magic.  Mary Poppins is the nanny any child could hope to magically appear out of the sky with her umbrella and whisk us away to enchanted places that we can only dream of.   In this film, Mary Poppins comes flying down to earth because two children, Jane and Michael Banks, are being ignored by parents who are too preoccupied with their own problems.   It's not that they don't love their children, but they fail to recognize the importance of children being part of their lives, a message that forty years later still rings true for many parents.  Julie Andrew's Oscar worthy performance as Mary Poppins is perfection.  It would have been easy for the character to become either ridiculously silly or a caricature of someone in the mold of a TV. witch or genie.  The fact that we are able to view Mary Poppins as first and foremost a caring and loving nanny who just happens to have magical powers is what makes this film works, and can be attributed solely to Ms. Andrews.  The fact that Julie Andrews has one of the most magnificent singing voices to land on the big screen didn't hurt a bit either.David Tomlinson made two other films for the Disney studios, but his role  as George Banks is the one for which he will always be remembered.  He too seems to strike just the right balance.  As the children's father, we are amused by his fussiness and his wish to achieve a perfectly ordered life, but put off by his ignorance in matters regarding his children.  The fact that we are able to see that despite his major character flaws he still loves his children keeps us from developing too much of a dislike for him.Glynis Johns as Winifred Banks is an odd kind of woman, especially for the early part of the twentieth century.  Her love for her two children also shines, yet her preoccupation with being a suffragette seems to override that fact.  Strangely though, she remains the loyal and obedient wife to her husband.  If there is one thing that always seems to be good about Disney films, it's the fact that Walt was able to find just the right child actors for any film.  As Jane and Michael, Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber are exceptional.  They appeared together in three films for the Disney studios and if you view this film you will understand why.There are many special effects sequences throughout Mary Poppins.   Some of them may be considered quite cryptic by today standards, but you won't mind.   The animation sequence is done with bright, glowing colors, and the fact that someone in the costume design department matched up the perfect outfits for the live actors in the sequence helps add to the beauty of it all.  I'm still in awe of Dick Van Dyke's dance number with the penguins in that sequence.  The chimney sweep sequence which includes a walk among the London rooftops and a marvelously choreographed dance being done by chimney sweeps is remarkable.  You'll laugh along with Uncle Albert, and have a swell tea party on the ceiling. Even if you don't find the jokes particularly funny you'll laugh at the absurdity of the situation.The songs by the Sherman Brother are once in a lifetime perfect.  I can think of no Disney live action film where the musical numbers are so right from start to finish.   Chim-Chim-Cheree won the Oscar for best song but it could just as easily have been to the less catchy numbers Stay Awake or Feed The Birds in my opinion.  Both are beautiful, lyrical songs that show the depth and range of Julie Andrew's voice.It takes a very special film that one can love as a child; yet as an adult appreciate the craftsmanship even more.

In my opinion, Star Wars (Episodes 4-6) make the greatest movie trilogy of all time. In Episode 6, Return of the Jedi, we see the gripping conclusion to the ultimate movie joyride. So strap yourself in for the ride of your life!After rescuing Han Solo and Princess Leia from certain doom at the hands of crime lord Jabba the Hut, Luke Skywalker revisits Yoda, Jedi Master. For only by completing his Jedi training can he become a true Jedi Knight and defeat Darth Vader and the dark side of the force. Creatures from all over the galaxy rally in attempt to defy the Galactic Empire in rebuilding an even more deadly Death Star.ROTJ is not the best Star Wars film of the trilogy, but it is not a bad film. It tidies up all the loose ends that have been started by the previous two films and continues on the emotion that Empire Strikes Back had. The Screenplay for ROTJ was done by Executive Producer George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan. I love the new characters that were included in this story, as they are fun to watch. I also enjoyed the funny little bits that were added into this Star Wars story, like having a musical section at the start of the film.I was amazed to see that all of the Star Wars trilogy movies have been directed by three different people. But with George Luca's in charge of the Star Wars franchise, any good director could do the film and it would come out ok. In the director's chair for ROTJ, was Richard Marquand, who did an amiable job. He continues on the space fantasy which is concluded in ROTJ.I have spoken about my feelings towards all the usual characters in the Star Wars trilogy. People like Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and the robot droids R2D2 (Kenny Baker) and C3PO (Anthony Daniels). They have all had a great impact on the series, and do what is needed to be done to make ROTJ an enjoyable film.In ROTJ we get to see some brand new characters. For the first time we get the chance to see the Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) who in the flesh, is a gruesome looking person. You can see why Darth Vader is so driven to serve the dark side of the force, as the Emperor is totally focused on making his side the strongest in the galaxy.But the best inclusion in this film has to be the fun little creatures called Ewoks, who are never referred to by name in the film. These Ewoks look like a cuddly teddy bear, but are very strong and aggressive little creatures. The funniest part with Ewoks has to be when these creatures mistakenly think C-3PO is some sort of god to them. There was also another interesting character from the rebellion, who was a major space commander. Insect look-a-like Admiral Piett (Kenneth Colley) is a man who is supposed to be taken seriously, but by looking at this person, you could be forgiven for starting to laugh at him as well.RTOJ has some very enthralling moments in it. The start of RTOJ shows us with Luke at his home planet, where he is out to rescue the ill-fated Han Solo. Here we meet back up with Jabba the Hut, a slimy creepy blob, who is very happy to see Han Solo in the position he is. But the demise of Jabba and his crew is great, as Luke shows himself to be a real Jedi. In fact in this sequence we see two other gruesome creatures, one, a scary monster, who Luke defeats and the other is a creature in a pit that lies in the waiting for his next feed.Other enjoyable sequences are the parts with the Ewoks, as they make the film seem much less serious, a good thing in my view. In this part of the film, we see Luke and his friends trying to destroy a power station for the new death star on the Ewoks planet. Here high speed hover scooters are driven, and although all these scooters seem fake, they only add to the fantasy. Finally the final confrontation between Vader and Skywalker is great, as more sword fighting just gets me more excited. Then for us as the audience to see Darth Vader's head was a true highlight of the film. It is interesting to note Darth Vader is the first character in movie history to be played by three actors (body by David Prowse, voice by James Earl Jones, face by Sebastian Shaw)So who are my favourite Star Wars characters? Well I like almost all of them, but my most compelling characters have to be Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader,    Obi-wan Kenobi, Yoda and the two droids, R-2D2 and C-3PO. All these character creations are some of the best I have seen in a movie.Every once in a while I have a great experience at a movie. That very experience was captured on me in the whole Star Wars trilogy (episodes 4-6), because people like myself can love these sorts of movies and get lost in them, so much so that we feel like we are part of the fantasy we are seeing played out on the screen. When a movie (or movies) can do this, I feel that they are something very special. Seeing all of the various characters from all of the Star Wars movies (episodes 4-6), has been a great pleasure and privilege for a film freak such as myself.

No matter what he tries, his fallacies draw  out conflict in one form or another. The saddest of these is in the death of Redmond's son  and the fall out with his wife and step-son.Barry Lyndon works on so many levels; technically, photographically, dramatically, and  ultimately Artistically.  Even more amazing is how Kubrick turned a wordy busy novel into a  quiet, powerful drama. This work is a reflection of the master status Kubrick deserves. A  photographer who is obsessed with perfection in his images. And a filmmaker who is  obsessed with cinema.  For me, Barry Lyndon is an unforgettable work of art.

This is a truly unbelievable movie, as it shows two very unique friends, and how far they would go, to keep from being separated.Heavenly Creatures paints a vivid and disturbing portrait of two teenage schoolgirls whose obsessive friendship leads to an unspeakable crime. This hypnotic thriller chronicles the story of Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker from the moment they meet during the 1950's in New Zealand. Unhappy with their lives, the girls withdraw deep into a bizarre fantasy world of their joint creation. But when faced with a devastating separation, the notorious pair plots a horrifying and violent solution to stay together.I want to give great praise to director, co-producer and writer of Heavenly Creatures, Peter Jackson. He made a very intelligent movie, putting great emphasis on every minor detail. His direction for this film does many things that I like, such as showing off many great scenic views of New Zealand. With every movie I see of Jackson's, I get the feeling that I would not mind going to New Zealand for a look. Then to keep in sink with the story, Jackson beautifully recreates a time that was undoubtedly very very conservative. Then to finish it all of, we get some remarkable special effects from Jackson, that show what a weird world these best friend's allow themselves to imagine and escape to.But without a well written story, this movie would not have been as great as it was. Helping Jackson with the screenplay was Francis Welsh. I very much like how the movie opens for us, as we get the impression that something strange has happened, but we are not sure what. While the ending of the film is also very confronting, as it shows what these girls plan to do and how they do it. Then to have the story retold to us via the diary entries of Pauline was great, as you could the true feeling of what life was like for these girls and how much they cherished each other.Other interesting themes in this story include how the film deals with the issues of homosexuality, an issue I am sure people in the 1950's would have not liked to confront. It was also good to see the mental issues surrounding both Pauline and Juliet. It was clear to me that Pauline was suffering from some sort of depressive illness, showing herself to be a very mixed up and crazy person. The scenes with Pauline at the psychiatrist are great as we get a true insight into what sort of person she really is.This leads me to the great performances by the two leading ladies of Heavenly Creatures. Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynsky) was a very interesting character watch unravel before me. Firstly she seemed a very quiet shy person, but after she meets Juliet (Kate Winslet), she certainly starts to change, as they share common interests, like tenor Mario Lanza and movie star Orson Welles.What I like about Lynsky's performance is her look, especially the camera shots from above her head, where she has this scathing look on her face, of pure hatred, just brooding inside of her. Winslet, in her first major role is quite superb as this girl who seems very easy-going and hyperactive. Her change in character was also great, as she could be so 'bright' and bubbly, and then look so sad and unhappy. It was as if she was a chameleon, able to change her way at the drop of a hatThe supporting cast here is also good. The roles I like the most, include Honara Parker (Sarah Peirse), Pauline's mother, a woman who is very good to her daughter, but is treated appallingly back. The other performance is Juliet's father, Henry Hulme (Clive Merrison), who alerts the Parker's that something bad could be developing between the two girls, as they grow closer as friends.As I was watching this movie, I started to remember a movie I watched last year which also showed another unspeakable crime. That movie was the controversial 'Bully', which showed another view of teenage sexuality, and how evil young people can be. In fact the 'plan' to trick a person into a vulnerable situation in Heavenly Creatures, was almost a carbon copy of Bully. I recommend both movies if you are yet to see them. The fact that this movie is based on true life events, makes it all the more poignant for me, because a crime such as this committed back in the 1950's would have been a huge scandal, but in today's society could construed as common place.Peter Jackson has made a great movie and presented a story that obviously he thought needed telling. I am glad he did. I also want to commend the casting people for their choices, as the wrong actors playing Pauline and  Juliet would have made this a bad movie to watch, but they got it right. Finally it was interesting to read, that the character of Juliet Hulme, is in real based on person by the name of Anne Perry, now a British crime novelist. From my research, this woman seems like a good person, and is still puzzled by the fact that she could help commit such an atrocity all those years ago, that this movie shows. All of us we be of that mind set after we have watched this movie, because I know I am!CMRS gives 'Heavenly Creatures' 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Movie) ","genre":null},{"date":"11 February 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Before Peter Jackson got into showing us how good a movie maker he was with the Lord of The Rings trilogy, he had made a very good movie 10 years ago, called Heavenly Creatures, an ironic title, as the people that we meet here are anything but 'Heavenly'.

The dystopian theme of the merciless future coming back to haunt the unsuspecting past makes this a deserved classic, and Cameron shows are rare budgeting genius as to what he can and cannot show to keep his audience impressed and off-balance (he knows we'll accept the time travel and the future with minimal evidence, but we'll never forgive him if we don't see the robot under there, so that's where he put all the money).What's more, the actors give it a sense of just plain fun.
