As the film opens we learn that Padmé is no longer the queen but the senator representing Naboo and somebody is trying to kill her. Obi-Wan and Anakin are assigned to protect her and in doing so learn that a weapon used was made on the planet Kamino which strangely appears in no records.Obi Wan heads to the site Kamino is meant to be Anakin takes Padmé back to Naboo where they grow closer then they should. On Kamino Obi Wan discovers that a vast army of clones is being prepared apparently at the request of a Jedi who had died ten years ago. Also there is the man this army was cloned from, a bounty hunter named Jango Fett, and his son Boba. When Obi Wan attempts to take him back to be questioned by the Jedi council he manages to escape but not before Obi Wan can put a tracking device on his ship which enables him to follow Jango to the planet Geonosis where a droid army is being constructed.Meanwhile back on Naboo Anakin is being haunted by dreams of his mother and decides he must return to Tatooine to help her. There he learns that she is no longer a slave and has got married, unfortunately a month before she was captured by Tuskan Raiders. He sets off to rescue her but is too late as she dies shortly after he finds her, in a fit of blind rage he slaughters everybody in the encampment.On returning to his ship he learns that Obi Wan has been captured on Geonosis so along with Padmé he heads there to attempt a rescue but this doesn't go according to plan and they too are captured and sentenced to death along with Obi Wan. They manage to break free but are still trapped in a large arena with three deadly creatures trying to kill them thankfully Mace Windu and the other Jedi arrive to help them fight the battle droids.Most of the major characters in film appeared in the previous film although Anakin is now played by Hayden Christensen. His character changed quite a lot too, instead of being a fun loving young boy he has become a whining teenager. The CGI seemed better than the previous film thus the battle scenes were much more believable. The dialogue has also improved but still contains several less than impressive one-liners, the romantic scenes between Padmé and Anakin don't seem very believable proving that George does special effects not people.If you liked The Phantom Menace or even thought it was just okay then I think this a film you would enjoy. I would certainly recommend watching that film before viewing this. The darker tone of this means it might not be suitable for very young children.

Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity revolves around an insurance fraud murder that appears foolproof until the seams start to tear. Walter Neff, the top salesman two months in a row, falls in love with the young wife of an oilman, a woman looking for a way to leave her troubled marriage. Who better to get away with the perfect crime then a man that sees false claims avenged everyday? Their tracks must be covered and their guilt assuaged. However, being as our first scene shows Walter confessing to everything, we know the well-laid plans were unsuccessful. The trick to the film becomes how it all went down, how the puzzle pieces fell into place, and the power of a conscience, eating away at you until you can't stand the pressure any longer.It is not giving away anything to say that the two complete the task of killing Mr. Dietrichson, a businessman with a temper. The deed is orchestrated to look like he fell off a train, a venue for accidental death that comes with a special double indemnity clause, one that pays twice the cost of his recently purchased insurance of $50,000. That money is the impetus that pushes Neff over the top to help his new mistress. Phyllis Dietrichson is the damsel in distress, the nurse of her husband's first wife that was naïve and heartbroken for her boss after his loss. She says it compelled her to stay with him in a union that never held any love. The chance arrival of Neff not only opens her eyes to the possibility of a clean break without any strings and actually some cash to boot, but also to a man she can spend time and possibly settle down with. It is a strange coincidence that the Dietrichson's auto insurance was allowed to lapse, creating a house call, and a happy accident that the man called to visit was one as immoral as Walter. Right from the start he flirts and makes advances towards the woman he knows is married to his client. It's not until the end that you start to consider whether none of it was by chance at all, but instead carefully planned out and manipulated from the first second.Neff is played by Fred MacMurray&#151;a perfect fit for the role of a shady salesman, unafraid to get his hands dirty. The confidence and swagger allow us to believe he can win over the girl as easily as he does. He is the kind of guy that can fool the world into thinking he is on the level, a man of intelligence and pride. His boss, Barton Keyes and he have a very close relationship, one based on mutual respect and admiration. Neff has them all fooled into believing he is a man of character, one Keyes would personally vouch for, and his initial balk at the offer to help kill Dietrichson shows that maybe he is. Maybe there is some semblance of humanity behind the quick-witted banter and devious smile, a moral compass that won't allow him to cross the line. But greed and lust can tempt even a saint, let alone a guy like Neff, and it doesn't take long for him to begin the blueprints for what will be the perfect crime; one that not even Keyes and his keen lie detector can spot. It is that question of virtue that will ultimately undo him, though, as the strong stomach he thought he had might not be indestructible.The story revolves around MacMurray and as a result he is on screen almost the entire time. He is our narrator and our entrance point into the proceedings. However, it is not a role that we necessarily relate to, nor even begin to feel sorry for to hope he gets away with the crime. Instead, knowing about his confession from the beginning, we sit down to watch his hubris shred his world to pieces. Each person is a cog to the tale at hand; it is the plotting of the film that takes center stage and top billing. The pieces are moved and we follow them through the twists and turns and revelations that change our preconceptions of each. No one is truly as they seem and they all have an ulterior motive just below the surface, propelling their actions and attempts for survival whether the other does or not. Our two criminals are selfish at heart, but until you watch the entire journey, you won't know just how much.While the acting is definitely dated and a product of its time, it doesn't mean that it's not good. Barbara Stanwyck plays MacMurray's partner-in-crime Phyllis with equal panache. She holds her own in every situation, whether with her sharp tongue in some very funny back and forths or in her steely disposition when things get rough, it's a part that needs to be strong and is. Barton Keyes is the role that sticks with you, though. Edward G. Robinson is fantastic as the cocky claims agent, self-proclaimed as never being wrong when his gut says something isn't right. He delivers some of the best lines with such deadpan seriousness that you laugh even harder. The ego, cynicism, and attitude all add up to a man you have to respect, because under the tough exterior lies a man with heart. His dynamic with MacMurray is an interesting one, especially when seen through to the end. While they aren't completely fleshed out, each character is a detailed piece to the intricate web of deceit on display. Surrogates for the story to be shown to the audience, we watch them not for who they are, but for what they will do.

No, the film should not have been cut down and butchered beyond all recognition as was the case with its original American theatrical release. Somewhere in between there must be a happy medium. But given the choice between the two extremes it is certainly much better that we are able to see the film as director Sergio Leone intended for it to be seen. Leone's vision for how the story should unfold is what makes the film unique. At times it can be a frustrating film to watch with its exceptionally deliberate pacing. There are certainly times while watching the film where you wish Leone would pick up the pace and move things along. But upon reflection, after seeing the whole film in its entirety, only then can you really appreciate what Leone has done. It's a terrific story and it's a story which is told in a simply brilliant manner. Yes, the film drags at times. Yes, there certainly could have been some cuts here and there to make the running time more manageable. But in the end there is no denying that the film works. It's by no means perfect. There are notable lulls and lesser moments scattered throughout. But the film as a whole ends up being greater than the sum of its parts. And you really cannot understand that until you settle in for the long journey and watch the whole thing.The film tells the story of a group of five young Jewish gangsters from New York City over a span of five decades or so. As you might imagine these characters lead violent lives and certainly not all of them are destined to survive this decades-long journey. But the way this story is presented we know the ultimate fates of some of these characters very early on in the film. That is because Leone presents his story in a non-linear fashion, cutting back and forth between three distinct eras. It is left to the audience, and one key character, to piece things together and it is really impossible to do so until the story has completely unfolded. Scenes which seem unimportant and superfluous take on an entirely different meaning when you see where the story eventually goes. Robert De Niro plays Noodles (because what's a gangster without a nickname?) and it is Noodles who is at the center of the film, tying the various eras together. A younger actor portrays the character in the film's earliest 1920s era when the gangsters are really just young boys. De Niro takes over the role for the other two eras, during the gangsters' 1930s prime and in 1968 when Noodles is pulled back into a world he thought he had left decades ago. De Niro owns the screen, his performance is perfect as he portrays the young 1930s tough and the older man of 1968 trying to unravel a very complex personal mystery. And De Niro is supported by a large group of excellent actors who bring each of the story's eras to brilliant life. James Woods as Noodles' closest friend in the gang and Elizabeth McGovern as the woman Noodles loves but is probably never destined to have give the two most notable performances aside from De Niro but really the entire cast is spot-on. From the young child actors portraying the gang in its earliest incarnation to Woods and McGovern and many other familiar faces who pop up throughout everyone involved seems to fit their role perfectly. It's a wonderful cast which does a magnificent job bringing a terrific story to life.So yes this is a film with a great story. And yes the cast is terrific. And yes the way Leone frames his story adds a brilliant touch. But there is the still the nagging thought that a little brisker pace would have helped. It's not even that entire scenes had to be cut as you realize in the end that every scene really does have its place. Its that Leone at times seems to linger on scenes where the important information the audience and characters need has already been relayed. And there are scenes where too much time is spent setting up the important event which is about to happen rather than simply getting to that important event. A few minor cuts here and there might well have lessened the frustration one senses as the film hits the occasional lull. It's a film with so many great moments but you wish Leone could have gotten in and out of those great moments a little quicker. But all in all this is a film which is certainly a long journey but definitely a satisfying one.

As you might imagine these characters lead violent lives and certainly not all of them are destined to survive this decades-long journey. But the way this story is presented we know the ultimate fates of some of these characters very early on in the film. That is because Leone presents his story in a non-linear fashion, cutting back and forth between three distinct eras. It is left to the audience, and one key character, to piece things together and it is really impossible to do so until the story has completely unfolded. Scenes which seem unimportant and superfluous take on an entirely different meaning when you see where the story eventually goes. Robert De Niro plays Noodles (because what's a gangster without a nickname?) and it is Noodles who is at the center of the film, tying the various eras together. A younger actor portrays the character in the film's earliest 1920s era when the gangsters are really just young boys. De Niro takes over the role for the other two eras, during the gangsters' 1930s prime and in 1968 when Noodles is pulled back into a world he thought he had left decades ago. De Niro owns the screen, his performance is perfect as he portrays the young 1930s tough and the older man of 1968 trying to unravel a very complex personal mystery. And De Niro is supported by a large group of excellent actors who bring each of the story's eras to brilliant life. James Woods as Noodles' closest friend in the gang and Elizabeth McGovern as the woman Noodles loves but is probably never destined to have give the two most notable performances aside from De Niro but really the entire cast is spot-on. From the young child actors portraying the gang in its earliest incarnation to Woods and McGovern and many other familiar faces who pop up throughout everyone involved seems to fit their role perfectly. It's a wonderful cast which does a magnificent job bringing a terrific story to life.So yes this is a film with a great story. And yes the cast is terrific. And yes the way Leone frames his story adds a brilliant touch. But there is the still the nagging thought that a little brisker pace would have helped. It's not even that entire scenes had to be cut as you realize in the end that every scene really does have its place. Its that Leone at times seems to linger on scenes where the important information the audience and characters need has already been relayed. And there are scenes where too much time is spent setting up the important event which is about to happen rather than simply getting to that important event. A few minor cuts here and there might well have lessened the frustration one senses as the film hits the occasional lull. It's a film with so many great moments but you wish Leone could have gotten in and out of those great moments a little quicker. But all in all this is a film which is certainly a long journey but definitely a satisfying one.

Why, Fred and Ginger, of course. I've got a feeling we'd better start watching their old movies again. Is Top Hat better than Swing Time? People have been staking out their positions for years. Me, I think both represent the height of the Astaire-Rogers magic, all wrapped up in some of the greatest songs ever written for Hollywood movies and with incomparable choreography and dancing. So I just flip a coin to decide...but I make sure I always use the coin with a head on each side. The story in Top Hat is inconsequential. It's all about Jerry Travers (Fred Astaire) an American dancing star in London who meets Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers), the girl who charms him. It's love at first sight for Jerry, but not for Dale. There are misunderstandings, reconciliation, comedy relief and...well, who cares? The point is that in Top Hat both Astaire and Rogers have classic Astaire and Rogers characters to play, he classy and without a major worry in the world, she down to earth and a little hard to get. The plot is light, sophisticated and moves quickly. The comedy relief, provided by Eric Blore, Edward Everett Horton, Erik Rhodes and Helen Broderick, often is genuinely amusing (We are Bates!) (I will never allow women to wear my dresses again!) and doesn't become tiresome. The songs by Irving Berlin are among the best he ever wrote, and are so spotted within the movie that it seems we keep moving from exhilaration to exhilaration. That said, the point of an Astaire-Rogers film is the dancing, and then the way things happen through the dances and the songs... No Strings introduces us to Jerry in one of those wonderful all white art deco hotel suites where sophisticated people hang out. He tells us in song just the kind of free-spirited guy he is...no strings and no connections, no ties to my affections... and then moves into a fast and complicated tap dance all over the room. Just watch how Astaire perfectly picks out a counter rhythm with hand slaps against a shelf while he taps. Isn't This a Lovely Day to Be Caught in the Rain is a total charmer. In a gazebo, Jerry tries to woo Dale. After singing the song, he does a few steps and she, hands in her pockets in her riding breeches, surprises him by taking him on. A little challenge dance starts...and then we're off into one of those great wooing dances that only Astaire could create. The longer they dance the more we see how taken with each other they're becoming. They move from an easy-going beginning into a mutual and happy recognition that something serious may be happening. Then the rain and the thunder start and we're off again. When the dance is over we all know something seriously happy really has taken place. I think this number also is a fine example of how Berlin could craft a great song where the lyrics are so conversational it's too easy to overlook the skill he had in placing them into the music Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain? You were going on your way, now you've got to remain. Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea, the clouds broke, they broke, and oh what a break for me. I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm. I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm. Let the rain pitter patter, but it really doesn't matter If the skies are grey. Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day Top Hat, White Tie and Tails is a classic Astaire stage number, a marvelous song impeccably delivered. Watch how he gives his head a little shake of sheer joi de vivre as he gives us that inimitable Astaire walk. Then it's on to all those 20 chorus boys in tuxes being mowed down by Astaire and his cane. The dance shifts from light to dark to light again. And watch how Astaire slows down the dancing and, unexpectedly, strikes several poses in silhouette. Great stuff. Cheek to Cheek is simply, in my opinion, one of the finest love sequences set on film. Astaire sings the song, then the two of them launch into one of the great dance duets where the song, the dancers and the choreography come as close to romantic perfection as you're likely to see. Even the feathers on Rogers' gown cooperate. The Piccolino is the big production closer, an attempt to match the craze the Carioca, in Flying Down to Rio, set off. For sheer Hollywood sound stage spectacle -- a Berlin hit song, at least 30 dancing couples, a singing chorus, gondolas on canals, a dish of veal that rhymes with piccolino, and everyone in gowns and tuxes -- it's hard to beat.

The movie feels like one with hugely potential and if it worked out better this could had really been an 'epic' strong feminist family drama but instead the movie jumps all over the place also with its different styles and it's mostly an ineffective one. There is not much interesting within the movie, although you certainly have the feeling that the story itself had plenty of interesting elements to offer but yet it somehow doesn't always translate well to the big screen. Perhaps if the movie would had been an hour longer it would had worked out better and also as a more effective one.The movie covers basically the entire lifespan of a strong-woman of the Dutch countryside and the future generations of women, her daughter her grand-daughter and right up till her great-grand daughter, while she herself is of course aging. This becomes an interesting aspect of the movie. It begins right after the end of WW II and it ends somewhere in the '90's or so I would guess. So the world around her is constantly changing but yet it also stays the same because she keeps all the people she care for close to her. This means that parts of the movie are set in different time-era's, which gives the movie something unique.It's obvious that this movie was intended as a strong feminist picture, with all strong female leads in it but with this I mostly feel that the movie isn't as effective as it should had been. It just doesn't feature enough strong or original moments within the movie.It's still a really well made and good looking movie though. It doesn't look at all like the movie got shot in the Netherlands, the countryside and all within this movie is far too beautiful looking for that. But I always have that with Dutch movies and I guess I just don't know how beautiful my country actually is. Perhaps I just need to stop watching so many movies and get out more...Female director Marleen Gorris is obviously capable of making a beautiful and professional looking movie. She actually now has a quite successful career in America as a movie director, which is quite an accomplishment not only because she is Dutch but also foremost because she is a female. She actually was the first woman to direct a movie that won an Oscar for best foreign film. Guess she is a strong woman just like Antonia in this movie and that's why she directed this movie with so much obvious passion and devotion. I wasn't too happy about the acting within this movie though. Willeke van Ammelrooy has always been praised for her role but in all honesty her performance is quite a mixed bag. As the younger Antonia she isn't always too great but as the older Antonia she's much better and more convincing. Can't say that the make-up always looks convincing though. Jan Decleir is normally always a real great actor but his role in this movie isn't anything too memorable but this is mostly due to the far too limited screen time he gets in this movie and he also has far too little lines to speak. He however still does a good job with his sequences and it's actually nice to notice that he took on a Dutch accent and for once dropped his native Belgian one.

Amadeus is an excellent and superbly-crafted film that is most likely the greatest stage-to-film translation in the history of film-making. Combining exotic and fascinating sets with great cinematography, flawless acting, grand writing, great directing, and a well-picked soundtrack to blend it all together, Amadeus is a visual treat full of deep themes that will move and question your soul. The effort involved is most likely the reason why mainstream audiences believed that everything that happened in the film actually happened, when in fact it's based off of a popular play. In this tale about religion, greed, envy, music, passion, and love, there is an overwhelming amount of material presented in its above-average running time. Calling this the best movie of 1984 and one of the better movies of the 1980s isn't a stretch at all.Amadeus starts off with an elderly and bitter Antonio Salieri reaching a low point in his depression by attempting to kill himself. He then confesses to a priest his story about his life involving Mozart, and the film enters a flashback mode that jumps between the past and present; the present in the movie is merely Salieri evaluating the events that were going on. The majority of Amadeus is about Salieri as he struggles to find peace with himself and God after witnessing a childish vulgar man deliver some of the best, daring, experimental, and unbelievable music the world had ever laid its ears on&#151;music that is much better than anything Salieri could produce. Salieri's jealousy and rage gets the better of him as his quest for vengeance and victory spirals out of control at the same time as Mozart's un-expecting depressing spiral. The movie focuses on many themes, with God and religion being the dominant theme.The strongest quality Amadeus possesses is the excellent directing and writing. The writer and creator of the play was involved with the screenplay, and overall its Oscar-worthy material. Stripping the themes and major ideas from the play and turning it into a film-like medium, the movie itself is just as powerful as the stage version. Peter Shaffer's influences include several short stories about Mozart and many rumored tales that Salieri confessed to killing Mozart (which is heavily debated even today). Milos Foreman, known for directing One Flew over the Cukoo's Nest, is at the top of his game here. We see many sweeping shots of the city streets, beautiful and massive sets for operas, performances, and musicals, and just so much more. It is one thing to have wonderful sets, but it takes a good director to know how to handle the 360 degrees of beauty surrounding the scene. Complimenting the directing is the editing, which apparently didn't win an Oscar. Try naming 10 scenes better-edited than the Requiem scene towards the end.In a rare double-nomination moment in the Academy, both of the main characters were nominated for best acting, and both of them should have won (instead of just one of them). The acting in Amadeus is nearly flawless, from Tom Hulce as Mozart to F. Murray Abraham as Saliri, to even the smaller roles (See pre-Sex and the City Cynthia Nixon pull a good performance in a minor role). The cast excels the movie into rarely-reached heights, as the opera singers and dancers and performers enhance the authenticity of the period piece and the way the performances were done back in the 18th century\/19th century. Even if you aren't a fan of the opera, you can't help but be startled by how long they can cling on to some of those notes.Bottom Line Stretching this review any longer would be an insult, because it shouldn't require this many words to describe why everyone should see this movie at least once. Amadeus is an excellent movie, no doubt about it. There's too much going for it for you to ever complain about the nitty-gritty details. The only setback is how much fiction is involved, even though some of Mozart's seemingly-exaggerated accomplishments are indeed true (Yes he did write professional music at age 4, yes he used to be able to memorize an entire piece of music after just one listen, and yes he wrote operas at age 7). But forgetting the loose mesh of fact and fiction and you'll find a rich movie full of wonderful music, beautiful scenery, and memorable scenes. Recommend to the highest degree, especially if you are a fan of classical music, or better yet a fan of good movies. Amadeus One of the shining gems of the 1980s.P.S. Someone come up with a great Beethoven movie, please, he deserves it.

The effort involved is most likely the reason why mainstream audiences believed that everything that happened in the film actually happened, when in fact it's based off of a popular play. In this tale about religion, greed, envy, music, passion, and love, there is an overwhelming amount of material presented in its above-average running time. Calling this the best movie of 1984 and one of the better movies of the 1980s isn't a stretch at all.Amadeus starts off with an elderly and bitter Antonio Salieri reaching a low point in his depression by attempting to kill himself. He then confesses to a priest his story about his life involving Mozart, and the film enters a flashback mode that jumps between the past and present; the present in the movie is merely Salieri evaluating the events that were going on. The majority of Amadeus is about Salieri as he struggles to find peace with himself and God after witnessing a childish vulgar man deliver some of the best, daring, experimental, and unbelievable music the world had ever laid its ears on&#151;music that is much better than anything Salieri could produce. Salieri's jealousy and rage gets the better of him as his quest for vengeance and victory spirals out of control at the same time as Mozart's un-expecting depressing spiral. The movie focuses on many themes, with God and religion being the dominant theme.The strongest quality Amadeus possesses is the excellent directing and writing. The writer and creator of the play was involved with the screenplay, and overall its Oscar-worthy material. Stripping the themes and major ideas from the play and turning it into a film-like medium, the movie itself is just as powerful as the stage version. Peter Shaffer's influences include several short stories about Mozart and many rumored tales that Salieri confessed to killing Mozart (which is heavily debated even today). Milos Foreman, known for directing One Flew over the Cukoo's Nest, is at the top of his game here. We see many sweeping shots of the city streets, beautiful and massive sets for operas, performances, and musicals, and just so much more. It is one thing to have wonderful sets, but it takes a good director to know how to handle the 360 degrees of beauty surrounding the scene. Complimenting the directing is the editing, which apparently didn't win an Oscar. Try naming 10 scenes better-edited than the Requiem scene towards the end.In a rare double-nomination moment in the Academy, both of the main characters were nominated for best acting, and both of them should have won (instead of just one of them). The acting in Amadeus is nearly flawless, from Tom Hulce as Mozart to F. Murray Abraham as Saliri, to even the smaller roles (See pre-Sex and the City Cynthia Nixon pull a good performance in a minor role). The cast excels the movie into rarely-reached heights, as the opera singers and dancers and performers enhance the authenticity of the period piece and the way the performances were done back in the 18th century\/19th century. Even if you aren't a fan of the opera, you can't help but be startled by how long they can cling on to some of those notes.Bottom Line Stretching this review any longer would be an insult, because it shouldn't require this many words to describe why everyone should see this movie at least once. Amadeus is an excellent movie, no doubt about it. There's too much going for it for you to ever complain about the nitty-gritty details. The only setback is how much fiction is involved, even though some of Mozart's seemingly-exaggerated accomplishments are indeed true (Yes he did write professional music at age 4, yes he used to be able to memorize an entire piece of music after just one listen, and yes he wrote operas at age 7). But forgetting the loose mesh of fact and fiction and you'll find a rich movie full of wonderful music, beautiful scenery, and memorable scenes. Recommend to the highest degree, especially if you are a fan of classical music, or better yet a fan of good movies. Amadeus One of the shining gems of the 1980s.P.S.

So when the grandfather comes with the book, it's one wicked invitation to read again in a cold, sick, and narrow world that has no reading, true knowledge, or moralities of heroism. We all live in this room, waiting for grandpa and his book to get us out. But while being a movie about the magic of the story, it didn't have any magic further than its story ! It's a little book of children; with no big budget, big stars, or big sets. In terms of sets in specific, according to some of them, like the Fire Swamp, I thought I was watching a fantasy-spoof ! In brief, it has very naive look. Some saw that as a loyalty to the simplicity of being a children book, not a typical Hollywood blockbuster; hence felt rare magic. And some saw that as simply poor; hence felt frustration (I'm one of the second team !).Director (Rob Reiner) tried to master grand aesthetic cadres and tough swords' duels, evoking all the innocent ventures for the kid in us. Though, there was some slackness, as if (Reiner) was making an old swashbuckler movie, and by its technique too ! Sometimes I felt the inactivity of the postal cards more than the vitality of the fantasy adventure. It left its powerful marks on the sequence of breaking into the palace near the end.And let's not forget the movie's top problem (Cary Elwes).

Although (Mark Knopfler)'s (Storybook Love) at the closing credits almost defined the finale's romantic dreamy song in the movies from the 1980s till now, but his music score for the movie was evident shortcoming. It's a standard soundtrack for a school play or a home-made movie. Well, the insistence of this movie to be poor is just weird. The only logical explanation is that they mistook poorness for innocence ! I didn't like the climax. It was so rapid, and the real hero of it was (Mandy Patinkin) as (Inigo Montoya), whereas (Westley) triumphs just by the power of being weasel. Maybe (Goldman) wanted to assure the ability of the word as well as the illusion, just like the ability of the grandfather, as the storyteller, through the story itself.

(Robin Wright Penn) is the princess bride in person; a clever image that jumped from one good old fairytale.

(André the Giant) was perfect as live cartoon character; (Fezzik) was his most lovable role, and perhaps his greatest ever. (Billy Crystal) and (Carol Kane) were so funny, I didn't recognize (Crystal) at first sight, but his signature voice, way of talking, and shortness uncovered him.

A trio of films appeared on USA which caught my attention, the Toxic Avenger series, and I was introduced to Troma. This was their flagship series, and it was rare that you'd find any other item as entertainingly zany, sick, and cheap as these films. Even close to these films were the Class of Nuke 'Em High movies which dealt with high school kids introduced to what toxic waste could do. But, in The Toxic Avenger, a geeky, buck-teethed janitor whose trusty mop was always by his side, ogling the bikini-clad aerobics gals who'd come to the gym he was employed to maintain their impressive bods, is the subject of what toxic waste can do to your anatomy when the skin and body are immersed in such chemicals..it can turn you into a grotesque superhero with amazing physique and martial arts skills, not to mention you can rip arms off and propel men in the air with ease. It all starts when four psychopaths, Slug(Robert Prichard), maniac Bozo(Gary Schneider), and their girlfriends, Wanda(Jennifer Prichard) and Julie(Cindy Manion)who frequent a gym wish to cause mop boy Melvin Junko(Mark Torgle)as much harm and humiliation as possible just for the hell of it. During their past time, these four enjoy driving over innocent people with Bozo's car, adding up points kind of like in the movie Death Race 2000. We see this when the four single out a kind little kid with a helmet riding his bike as they run him over before crushing his head under their back tire! They take Polaroids, for which gets the girls hot and bothered. Yep, this is not for the squeamish or those who demand films of good taste. Anyway, Julie prompts Melvin to slip on a pink tutu so that she can get all worked up for a little sex, setting the poor kid up for a cruel practical joke, concerning a lamb, with all the customers of the gym laughing their asses off at his expense. Tormented and crazed, Melvin throws himself through a window. What Melvin doesn't expect is to fall into a barrel of toxic waste placed inside a parked truck hauling the stuff to a nearby landfill. The toxic waste in turn transforms Melvin into a ghastly monster with a homing beacon towards evil. Anyone corrupt, gangsters, hoodlums, and crooked city officials, are targets of the Toxic Avenger. Three slimy thieves with weapons attempting to rob a taco store with an innocent bi-stander getting a shot-gun blast to the chest, a blind beauty's seeing-eye-dog also getting it right in the stomach, with our toxic superhero coming to save the day. He rips the leader's arm off before stuffing him into a stove, makes an ice-cream sundae out of another's face before driving a drill into his eye, and boiling the last criminal's hands in grease! A gang of mobster's thugs beating up a beat cop get their heads caved in by crushing blows while the third gets away momentarily before attempting to retaliate with more hoods carrying arsenal. This all takes place before Melvin can get his revenge against the four who ultimately wronged him the most. There's a loopy sub-plot featuring the love-affair between Toxie and a blind babe who talks with eyes WIDE open(..she's the one with the dog who got shot by the hoods in the taco store). And, the actual chief villain of the film is the corrupt mayor of Tromaville(..the humongous Pat Ryan)who works behind the scenes with the villainous scum behind the crime of the city.

A trio of films appeared on USA which caught my attention, the Toxic Avenger series, and I was introduced to Troma. This was their flagship series, and it was rare that you'd find any other item as entertainingly zany, sick, and cheap as these films. Even close to these films were the Class of Nuke 'Em High movies which dealt with high school kids introduced to what toxic waste could do. But, in The Toxic Avenger, a geeky, buck-teethed janitor whose trusty mop was always by his side, ogling the bikini-clad aerobics gals who'd come to the gym he was employed to maintain their impressive bods, is the subject of what toxic waste can do to your anatomy when the skin and body are immersed in such chemicals..it can turn you into a grotesque superhero with amazing physique and martial arts skills, not to mention you can rip arms off and propel men in the air with ease. It all starts when four psychopaths, Slug(Robert Prichard), maniac Bozo(Gary Schneider), and their girlfriends, Wanda(Jennifer Prichard) and Julie(Cindy Manion)who frequent a gym wish to cause mop boy Melvin Junko(Mark Torgle)as much harm and humiliation as possible just for the hell of it. During their past time, these four enjoy driving over innocent people with Bozo's car, adding up points kind of like in the movie Death Race 2000. We see this when the four single out a kind little kid with a helmet riding his bike as they run him over before crushing his head under their back tire! They take Polaroids, for which gets the girls hot and bothered. Yep, this is not for the squeamish or those who demand films of good taste. Anyway, Julie prompts Melvin to slip on a pink tutu so that she can get all worked up for a little sex, setting the poor kid up for a cruel practical joke, concerning a lamb, with all the customers of the gym laughing their asses off at his expense. Tormented and crazed, Melvin throws himself through a window. What Melvin doesn't expect is to fall into a barrel of toxic waste placed inside a parked truck hauling the stuff to a nearby landfill. The toxic waste in turn transforms Melvin into a ghastly monster with a homing beacon towards evil. Anyone corrupt, gangsters, hoodlums, and crooked city officials, are targets of the Toxic Avenger. Three slimy thieves with weapons attempting to rob a taco store with an innocent bi-stander getting a shot-gun blast to the chest, a blind beauty's seeing-eye-dog also getting it right in the stomach, with our toxic superhero coming to save the day. He rips the leader's arm off before stuffing him into a stove, makes an ice-cream sundae out of another's face before driving a drill into his eye, and boiling the last criminal's hands in grease! A gang of mobster's thugs beating up a beat cop get their heads caved in by crushing blows while the third gets away momentarily before attempting to retaliate with more hoods carrying arsenal. This all takes place before Melvin can get his revenge against the four who ultimately wronged him the most. There's a loopy sub-plot featuring the love-affair between Toxie and a blind babe who talks with eyes WIDE open(..she's the one with the dog who got shot by the hoods in the taco store). And, the actual chief villain of the film is the corrupt mayor of Tromaville(..the humongous Pat Ryan)who works behind the scenes with the villainous scum behind the crime of the city.

They are purely made to bring emotions to the screen and their heavy handed. You just know that from start till finish there will be nothing to enjoy about the movie and it is going to be as serious as it can get. The Grapes of Wrath is such a drama, so if you don't like heavy, serious drama's, this just ain't the movie for you to watch.Because the movie is so incredibly heavy handed and self righteous, this perhaps isn't the masterpiece everybody telling you it is but there is no denying that the movie is really well made and also features some great acting performances. But because it's such an extreme drama it often feels forced as well and causes the movie to be a long watch, even though it really isn't a that long movie. It's just a movie with a real slow pace and yes I would definitely call it boring in parts, even though lots of (dramatic) things are happening within this movie. It really isn't the most exciting movie to watch and therefore also not really a very effective one. Even though I could appreciate the movie for what it was, it just didn't ever grabbed me with its emotions, story or characters, no matter how very well it all got done.But no, I obviously didn't hated this movie, on the contrary really. Seriously, how can you hate such a well crafted movie like this? Even though this movie got released in the early '40's it still has a real typical '30's look and feeling over it. The '30's really used to be the era of some of the best and most effective drama movies.It's a movie that obviously got well directed, by John Ford, who loved to make real 'American' movies. His movies always have something proud and patriotic about it but without the flag waving and such. To the main crowd he is perhaps best known for the work he did within the western genre, with movies such as Stagecoach and Rio Grande under his belt.It's also a beautiful looking movie with its cinematography and sets and costumes, which really suits the time period the movie got set in.It has a really great story and amazingly enough things like this really happened back then in America. I didn't knew anything about this piece of history, so I definitely learned something new from it. It's a pretty amazing story and you would have a hard time believing it if you didn't know that things like this really happened in the past. The first halve of the movie is basically a road trip with lots of drama to it obviously, while the rest of the movie also tends to be very dramatic, when the family constantly tries to settle down where ever there is work (and more trouble).Henry Fonda really plays a great role and he himself also considered it to be the role out of his career. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role. The movie also has an amazing supporting cast, with for instance fine acting performances from Jane Darwell and John Carradine. Darwell even won an Oscar for her part in this movie. It was one of the 2 Oscar's this movie received. The other was for director John Ford. Both deserved their win I would say. The movie got nominated in 5 more categories, including Henry Fonda's nomination.Perhaps not the masterpiece I was expecting, it was too overdone and heavy handed for that but nevertheless one great movie, that I surely appreciated watching.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"30 September 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" You know, some movies are just made as pure drama's.
