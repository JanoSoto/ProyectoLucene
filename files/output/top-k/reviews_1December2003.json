THIS is the only movie so far that terrified me !! I suffer from a really bad form of vertigo and around the time this movie got released in the theaters, I even felt sick when I was looking at the poster. It felt like a combination of my two biggest fears  heights and being frozen to death. Even though some of my favorite actors star in Vertical Limit, it took me quite long before I finally got the courage to watch it.The story of Vertical Limit is typical and there isn't anything original about it all. That's fine with me, I just considered it to be an old-fashioned adventure movie with good acting and stunning photography. Vertical Limit is the typical story of siblings who lost their father in a climbing accident. Ever since, the son ( Chris O'Donnel ) has stopped climbing. His sister ( Robin Tunney ) hasn't she's going to conquer K2 with the rich Texas guy Vaughn (Bill Paxton). Of course, this goes wrong and Chris has to set up a rescue missing to go and save his sister. A whole bunch of typical characters are introduced and everything that can possibly go wrong, does go wrong. The quality level of Vertical Limit is merely held up by the acting performances...and more specifically  Scott Glenn and Bill Paxton. Both these overtalented - yet underappreciated - actors are cast perfectly. Glenn is impressive as the mysterious loner Montgomery Wick who dwells around K2 and Paxton is the worst kind of bad guy a movie can have. He isn't really the villain but he's the arrogant business guy who quickly turns into a selfish, egocentric and mad person who's willing to sacrifice everything to survive. Terrific performance. All the other aspects you expect are there as well. A developing love story, funny one-liners and the oversentimental morality and happy ending. Mainstream stuff but certainly not bad. Enjoyable and recommended to fans of beautiful landscapes.

I like Connery also but he's not so good at humor. Connery's most humorous Bond films Diamonds are Forever & Never Say Never Again would have definitely been done better by Moore. Connery seemed miscast in those films. . I always disagreed with the critics who said that Roger Moore didn't fit the Bond role until The Spy who Loved Me. I thought he was great from the beginning in Live and Let Die. I see why he was the first choice to play Bond. Too bad he wasn't available.Ok The Man with the Golden Gun has always been one of my favorite Bond films. It has plenty of all the necessary ingredients Action, Comedy, and Bond Babes.

A father takes his family on a road trip and along the way experiences-well-the good, the bad, the ugly-just about everything! Great premise for a fun movie and vacation WAS fun but it definitely had parts that were more crass then funny and I could see the multiple viewing thing grating on you after awhile.I agree with the IMDb user who mentioned te scene where the dog is dragged by the car was not necessary. But it wasn't just THAT one scene-many times the movie seemed to be trying for laughs through shock value. It wasn't necessary, the truly funny parts were the more subdued. The in your face vulgarity that frequently surfaced wasn't necessary to make this pic good and actually detracted from it, I thought. This was a movie that was sometimes HILARIOUS, sometimes merely funny, but other times somewhat crude. I still think it was a pretty funny comedy, if I met someone who hadn't seen it(don't know many) I 'd recommend they give it a viewing.

If you don't want to read and either love BWP or instead want something that doesn't suck, go watch The Last Broadcast. It's similar, came first, is better acted, and has an actual ending that makes sense.The BWP began with a huge ad campaign, in the form of allegedly true documents and paranoia propaganda that took major advantage of the internet community. It got people out in droves to see what this thing really was. And what it was was an hour and a half of kids with a camera, walking in circles through the woods, working themselves into a paranoid frenzy while building to a climax (spoiler next) that literally delivers nothing.(Spoiler end.) The premise, and what the online campaign hinted as being true, is this A small town legend, the Blair Witch, is terrorizing a town and abducting children. Three stupid teens go into the woods armed with a camera and try to film \/ find evidence of this, and are never heard from again. Their videotape surfaces, and what is on it is mysterious.Now here's the literal truth of what happened The two creators of this film built a long, slow consumer awareness program by leaking supposedly legitamite details of the Blair Witch incidents, like fictitous police reports and interviews. Over several months, people were hearing about the Blair Witch case with the overwhelming sense that it was all real. Then the film was released in theaters and included what was supposedly the non-fiction video documentary of three kids who disappeared while looking in those woods. The lines of fantasy and reality had been effectively blurred, and people came out in droves to see what was really going on.Seeing as how the actors in the film were on Jay Leno that very weekend, I was readily aware that it wasn't real. But I went anyway, out of curiosity. I thoroughly, thoroughly despised what I saw. I didn't have high hopes, since I hadn't yet read the much more entertaining web site stuff. But I was so angry that at the end of the film, I loudly said Bulls***! I want my 7 bucks back! And was met with rousing applause, and yes, a few boos.I'm a patient man, and very tolerant. I've seen subtitled, three hour long black and white foreign films. Ever heard of the 50 hour Three Kingdoms chinese hitorical series? Yeah, I sat through that. I liked Titanic. And I've seen horror movies including Dawn of the Dead, House of 1000 Corpses, the Sixth Sense, Nosferatu, the black and white Frankenstein and Draculas, and even comparably modern junk like the Scream trilogy. And aside from Scream 3, I loved all of it. But with the Blair Witch Project, I was simply offended. I fell victim to a marketing scam, and the fact that some people still call it genius burns me to this day.This is why. The movie, viewed as itself, is utter garbage. For the fans out there, what are you gauging the movie by? The acting? The plot? The PACING!? Three kids whine, nitpick, argue, and cry throughout the vast majority of it all. There's a scene when the most annoying character, the woman (she's that hideous nose \/ eye creature you see on the box and probably think is the Blair Witch) breaks down in hysterical, overacted tears simply because the team has made a circle and is crossing the same log they've already crossed. And if you don't mind, here's a spoiler so be prepared There is no Blair Witch. You see nothing on camera. You hear some noises, see strange clues like wooden sticks. And at the end, during a scene that should have been halfway through the movie, you see a creepy house with some blood on it. Then the movie ends. Period. I do not exagerrate. And I don't HAVE to see something to enjoy it. Jeez, 1997's Contact was great, for example. But when you build up a movie like this, can you not put SOMETHING up there to qualify my time?(spoiler done) But you see, we're supposed to buy all that because it's a masterful example of anticipation, suspense, and power of suggestion over visuals, harkening back to the old days when stuff didn't have to be flashy and obvious to be frightening. Well, no, sorry. There is nothing frightening about kids in a tent, crying and shivering, and saying they've heard things. (Poss. Spoiler) It's a ghost story with no payoff. They, and we, see and hear nothing to suggest anything more horrible than common woodland noises at night. (Spoiler end) The kids work themselves up like schoolchildren and start freaking out so badly that they frighten themselves beyond belief, at nothing. That isn't scary, suspenseful, or playing on my natural fears. If I got afraid just because I saw other people terrified of whatever it was that they were imagining, I would have been a basket case in grade school. And even if scared people WERE enough to scare me, it's still a wash because the majority of the movie takes place in the daytime, where nothing of importance happens. I go on vacations to other countries and tape less daytime commonalities than these idiots. And Yeah, if a ten minute argument over someone losing the map is scary, then I guess I've just been spoiled by GOOD films like Psycho and The Thing.And these kids are just horrible to begin with. They're the most annoying bunch I've ever heard, and I was hoping halfway through that the girl would just die to move the plot. But instead, we get lots of arguing, lots of wandering, lots of hysteria, and a few hints of plot like finding an unidentified bloody cloth one morning.Here, in its simplicity, is why this movie does not deliver. 1 If it's viewed on its own, without external knowledge of promotional material, the movie is baseless, without support, and with no closure or explanation. Without background information it's a pointless mess, so we must judge it by the material that got us interested in the first place- and that material was far more interesting. 2 If viewed as REAL, one must ignore the fact that it's well known as one of the most fiercely debated and famous films ever. But since the hook was that it might BE real, it's a waste. 3 If one watches it as a MOVIE to be entertained by, it's a dud due to horrible and annoying performances, no pacing or twists, and worst of all, no payoff. It winds up being an amateur film without music, lighting, or a good script.All I can say is that the fake case history that the creators came up with to sell this crap WAS intruiging, and was more interesting than the film by leaps and bounds. My cousin struggled to defend his like of the movie until finally deciding on a reason that satisfied him, and became the only explanation I could possibly buy That Blair Witch was worth watching simply as a side bonus to the crafted material that he was more interested in. I don't want to insult the people who did like the film, but if you did, that must mean it scared you. Well once you get over the fear, I ask you to watch it again a few times. WHAT scared you? What mood were you in, to where you were actually frightened? Was it simply not knowing what the kids would find? (Spoiler alert) Well now that you know you never see the supposed Witch or anything that is NOT possibly manmade, is it still scary? (Spoiler over).  I wasn't scared at all because I knew it was fictitous, and went anyway just to see what was supposedly so good. I was bitterly disappointed to see Blair Witch for what it was Two guys who took advantage of the gullibility of the public, tempted them, played to their fear, and failed to deliver on a mental, intellectual, or even visual level. The only genius of the Blair Witch Project is, simply, how well it was used to scam the public. And I truly believe that the only people scared by this film are people like the kids IN it People who are scared because it seems like they should be, without even any evidence to support the fear. Sure, you may watch the BWP thinking it'll be scary, and nervous in anticipation of what you might see. But by the end, what did you ACTUALLY see?

On Xmas Eve 2000, my theater hadn't yet gotten Cast Away or Crouching Tiger, but it did have my third choice, D&D. Well, I've never been so intricately close to D&D that I would have been labeled a sinner in the 80s, but I have ALWAYS loved medieval fantasy, and many of the D&D stories and characters. So, I had the feeling going to the film that I would have a good old popcorn munching time with one of my favorite genres. No decent movies about medieval times had come out in a while, so what better than D&D to end the drought?Well, I left the theater laughing. Not at the movie, but at myself for having such high hopes. It had potential, I'll say that. I chuckled at a joke or two, I liked some of feel, like magicians and thieves and whatnot. But in the end, it felt like a washed out, Lord of the Rings lite. And who would have known that LOTR would indeed come out a year later and absolutely blow everyone's socks off?The main problem with D&D is its basic plot. Several characters band together to retrieve a magical item and defeat the wizard. Ok, sounds fair. But the characters are so wooden and stereotypical, I just didn't care. The thieves are rebels who believe in justice and equality. The wizards are old and power hungry. The dwarf likes beer and fights. The elves are delicate and mysterious. And that's about the most we get to know anybody, although the main two characters (thieves) get more screen time and somewhat anachronistic dialogue. I admit I was surprised by a death halfway through, and surprised again at what happened \/ didn't happen with the dead at the end of the film. But outside of that, it's pretty stock stuff. And don't look for Jeremy Irons to save the film, he overacts here with the best of them. Although I did enjoy his last scene or two involving his magic and the dragon battle.I guess bottom line is that it's worth a see if you're a real D&D or fantasy fan, but other than that, it's not that great, and if you've seen Lord of the Rings by then you've already seen better.

The movie opens with Neil Page (Steve Martin) sitting in a meeting that will just not end.

Neil races to catch taxis and Airplanes, but it seems as if the whole world is turned against him.

But it starts to gain momentum as more things go wrong for Neil, and you feel annoyed and a little bad for him, and the more things that happen to him, the funnier the movie gets.  Steve Martin made me feel annoyed, which is a good thing in this case.  He was so believable in his character of Neil Page that I was feeling all of his feelings right along with him.  If I ever had to share a hotel bed with Del Griffith I would take a shower for days, and I would scrub my skin clean until it bled.

I do not, like many, consider this to be the best film ever made. Further more I don't even consider it the best science fiction film ever made and I do not even consider it to be the best Star Wars film ever made (that distinction, in my opinion, belongs to The Empire Strikes Back). However, there is no denying that this is one of the most enjoyable blockbusters from Hollywood ever made. Setting in stone the foundations that blockbusters need, such as a high number of special effects, action sequences, a bunch of heroes and a good looking female lead, George Lucas has not created a work of art, but he has created one of the most perfect examples of what can be done in Hollywood. A hugely enjoyable adventure that amazes the eyes and senses. There's no point saying that the acting and script are great because they aren't. While Alec Guinness, Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones are fantastic, don't get me wrong, there isn't really anything here that could be considered award worthy, but that's not the point here. This is a film that will leave with a smile on your face for the simple reason that this is a blockbuster that is exciting, emotional and at its heart simple. The story is easy to follow, the characterization never complex and we can like all of it because it's so easy to watch.There is a lot that is right. Darth Vader's entrance almost seems to have been done with the knowledge that he would become one of modern cinemas most famous villains, the Death Star battle is superb by 1977 standards, while Carrie Fisher is undeniably one of the most beautiful females to have graced the screen (less so now, but then she was a stunner), while Harrison Ford has 'star' written all over him, it's not surprising that Indy, Jack Ryan and Blade Runner followed. George Lucas makes his film in the same way that a skilled magician does a trick, with style, ease and in a way that the audience is left awed. It is easy to why the fans have taken with it, even if it is less so why it tops films polls voted for by the public. Then there is John Williams music score which is deserving of its status while C-3PO is without doubt the best 'comical' robot to appear on film.The sense of magic about this film is undeniable. Empire may be the better film, but it is also the darkest, while the Ewoks were entertaining enough, but they still can't beat this, while the prequels, undeniably with better special effects and light sabre fights, concentrate too much on the CGI sets to have us fully engage (even if I must say, they aren't as bad as everyone makes out, if you ask me.)So there it is Star Wars. The greatest film of all time? No. The most cerebrally stimulating? No, it's not that either. Is it the most entertaining and fun film ever made? Yes it is, and for that we should always be thankful.

I still want to think that this movie was just an evil joke. The first Mortal Kombat was such a fun high action packed film that was just a great time. I still watch it like crazy today, it's got so much energy and makes me want to play the game again and again. So since the first film was a success, naturally they were going to make a sequel and they did manage to mess this one up badly. I'll start with the plot first and explain in a moment all the badness that is the mess.The evil emperor Shao Kahn opens a portal from Outworld to the Earthrealm and has reclaimed his queen Sindel, who is Kitana's long-dead mother. Earthrealm is therefore in danger of being absorbed into Outworld within six days, a fate which Liu Kang and the others must fight to prevent. Sonya enlists the help of her old partner, Jax , while Kitana and Liu Kang search for a Native American shaman named Nightwolf , who seemingly knows the key to defeating Kahn. Kitana and Liu Kang dispatch him with the aid of Sub-Zero, but Scorpion suddenly appears, attacks Sub-Zero, and kidnaps Kitana. Now Liu must save her as well as Earth from Kahn who wishes to blend the realms together.I'm sure you've read and heard it before but in case you haven't and you're reading my comment first for some reason to find out what makes this a bad movie, well read away. First off, what bad replacements for the actors Sonja, Johnny Cage, Rayden. They don't look anything like the original actors, it was just bad. The acting is horrible, like really bad, like they went to the Keanu Reeves school of acting bad. The special effects are something that could be easily done on an elementary school computer. The editing is too fast and gives you a massive headache.There's a mud wrestling match between Sonja and Mileena, which I'm sure the director was telling them it was for the cool effect of the fight while I'm sure he was playing with his stick shift behind the camera while this was going on. There is no explanation for why Scorpion and Sub Zero are back, except that Sub Zero is Sub Zero's brother, yet they have the same names? Doesn't make much sense does it? The fight scenes are so badly put together, there's a scene where the ninjas look like they're doing ballet, not fighting. Rayden spends so much time talking to the group and finally when he has a chance to fight, he bows out like a coward.Yeah, that's just some of the film that I'm describing. Scary sounding, isn't it? I don't know what they were thinking when they thought that this was OK to put in the theaters. The first film was a lot of fun, it stuck true to the video games and is one of the best video game movies of all time.
