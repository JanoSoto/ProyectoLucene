I've seen many films and this one really comes out. I think this movie is 'timeless'. It's an old movie, made in 1994 (I wasn't even born) but it doesn't feel like that when you are watching it. Alright I have to admit that you can see it on the quality of the film and on other things too. It isn't HD or something like that but it gives the film a special character that it needs to be so good. It also doesn't have all those special effects like in Life of Pi, with the tiger Richard Parker who is fully made with the computer, or in the Avengers. So it isn't spectacular in that way. I think the movie is spectacular in the way it's built up and in its plot line.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is locked up in the Shawshank State Penitentiary because he is accused of murdering his wife and her lover. In prison he gets to know smuggler Ellis Red Redding (Morgan Freeman) and soon they become friends. Red smuggles a rock hammer in prison for Andy to make 'chess pieces'. He also gets several posters and other stuff. He makes his chess pieces, but that's not the only reason for buying his hammer. He also has some other plans.

It's nice to see an immensely talented actor finally get his due from Hollywood, however, it's upsetting to see it's for a film that largely pales in comparison to Pacino's other pictures such as The Godfather trilogy and Scarface and a performance that doesn't hold a candle to the ones he gave in the aforementioned films.It's bizarre out of the library of terrific Pacino performances we've been so grateful to see over the years, the Academy recognizes one that is good at the same time all over the place and inconsistent, even though it's one of the best inconsistent performances I have yet to see. The film centers around Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a student at a prestigious New England prep school who is assigned to look after a retired Army Ranger Lieutenant Colonel named Frank Slade (Al Pacino). Frank is a blind man, often loud, frequently outspoken, loves his drinks, and feels completely entitled to speak his mind whenever he feels like it. It is only a screen writing obligation that these two will embark on some life-altering adventures and find ways to open up to each other in ways they never foresaw.Scent of a Woman's writer Bo Goldman pulls no punches whatsoever, for this is a straight-forward drama about companionship and loss with little to no presence of deeper meaning or multilayered storytelling. Not every film needs to be heavy on symbology or even multilayered, but when a story is a sometimes merciless one-hundred and fifty-three minutes, one hopes that at some point a line is drawn and deeper, rawer human emotions surface or some other facet pops up to reveal another layer.But sadly there isn't one, and because of that, Scent of a Woman flounders because of how basic it is. We see young Charlie leave a lasting impact on Frank and Frank leave an impact on Charlie, which as cute as it is sometimes, can also be dreadfully boring, especially for such a lengthy amount of time. This is one-hundred and five minutes of material stretched out forty-eight minutes longer and occasionally finds itself going in circles over material and events it has just covered.When it comes down to the chemistry between Pacino and O'Donnell, it's uniformly solid. Both actors have a believable sense of friendship in the film, especially during scenes like the one at the dinner table, the one when Charlie allows Frank to drive a Ferrari down an unpopulated alleyway, or when Frank sticks up for Charlie in the end of the film. Both men are believable as friends and work well as an on-screen duo.With that being said, Pacino's performance still finds itself registering all over the place and having issues setting up a clear tone throughout the film. Frank will be calm and collective on some occasions mirroring the likes of mentally unstable on other occasions. Some scenes, Frank will be shouting at the top of his lungs, others, he'll be barely cracking a whisper. This is the performance that won Pacino the Oscar, mind you - not the subtleties he presented as Michael Corleone, not the brash assertiveness he exerted as Tony Montana, but the up-and-down tendencies he brought to the table in Scent of a Woman. While this is by no means a bad performance (and definitely shows its effectiveness by the end, with Frank in the courtroom scene), it still isn't the kind of performance one would see Pacino winning, especially with his already exceptional résumé.Furthermore, it's worth noting that the presence of Thomas Newman's turgid score that needs to emphasize every emotional instance in the film gets to be insufferable to say the least. Newman's score chimes in and plays precisely the kind of tune you expect to hear during scenes of conflict, happiness, joy, and sorrow with absolutely no subtly whatsoever. Then there's the courtroom scene that concludes the film, which feels extracted from a completely separate film.When you have a film that already overextends itself in its groggy runtime, presents a performance that is, for the lack of a better term, all over the place, and a score that leaves no ambiguity, Scent of a Woman almost seems down and out accept for the fact that it does present a well-orchestrated human interest story and how companionship is one of the fundamentals to a good life. Regardless of how long, occasionally tiresome, and overblown the film can be, it still possesses a delightful focus on character over plot, which I always admire.The film comes from Martin Brest, an underrated director known for his action comedies such as the exciting Beverly Hills Cop, the hilarious and too-often enthralling Midnight Run, and the unfairly bashed Gigli, which ostensibly crippled his career (Brest hasn't directed since its release in 2003). Brest's usual investment with character relationships is present but absent this time around are his action set pieces, which provide a nice addition of variety in Brest's short but sweet filmography.Scent of a Woman reminds me quite a bit of Dead Poets Society for more reasons than it deals with a prep school. Both films have a cloying obviousness to their writing and directing, making their themes completely heavy, and staging their emotional sequences as if they were the most powerful to ever exist. The film works best when it is underplaying its central ideas, focusing on more abstract scenes like the key scene here, which involves Frank on a plane fondly recalling the beautiful qualities of a woman, detailing the scent of her hair, the feel of her lips, the texture of her breasts, etc. It's a beautiful scene - Scent of a Woman needed more of those.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"25 March 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" It's almost axiomatic that a prestige drama, the kind that contends for awards and aims to join the canon, must combine a love story with a weighty historical plot line. Best Picture winners The Deer Hunter, Out of Africa, The English Patient, Titanic, as well as countless films that didn't take the Academy's top prize, all fit neatly into this category. It is probably too simplistic to say that all these movies are on some level attempts to remake Casablanca, and certainly movies, not to mention plays and books, had discovered long before Casablanca that mixing romantic drama and historical drama makes for good entertainment. But Casablanca became a template and a benchmark. These facts are attested to by the number of its one-liners that became part of the cultural lexicon, and by its apparently permanent residence near the top of critical and popular lists of great films. One important element that sets it apart from run-of-the-mill, wanna-be historical romances is its humor, an ingredient many serious movies neglect to utilize. One moment the French national anthem brings us to our feet and tears to our eyes, and the next we are laughing at one of the funniest lines and most imitable comic deliveries in movies, Claude Rains's I am shocked, shocked... Every scene belongs almost to a different genre the script rotates jokes, intrigue and espionage, a dreamy romance in flashback form, a will-they-or-won't-they soap opera in the present, musical numbers, and high-minded talk of war and freedom. But for all that, it doesn't feel like the movie is overstuffed or that there's even particularly a lot going on beneath the surface. It is tempting to read the studiously-neutral but soft-hearted American Rick (Humphrey Bogart) as a metaphor for the U.S.'s reluctance to intervene in European conflicts, and it is interesting to observe the ways this wartime Hollywood movie depicts European refugees of various ages, nationalities, and genders, but in this case it is more fun to simply be swept along by the movie as a great piece of entertainment. Casablanca is just a simple story well-told, set in an exotic and dangerous and alluring locale, and it might be that better than anything else has ever been that.

A fourth witness (Takashi Shimura) offers his own version, again different.

Truth, history, memory and the past &#x85; are these just fictions?One character is told that lying is natural for all of us, and it is in the discrepancies that the essence of our humanity resides. Kurosawa invests the unknowability of the event with horror, suggesting that the three of them somehow chanced upon, or created, a black hole in human thought and communication, whose confusion and violence can never be clearly explained or remembered.The movie that put Japanese cinema on the map. Unlike a traditional whodunit, events get murkier and more tangled with Kurosawa cranking up the intrigue and uncertainty as contrasting viewpoints clash. The stunning look of the movie - from the torrents of rain in the opening shots to the dappled sunlight in the forest - plays its part in making every little thing difficult to discern, backed up by forceful performances, especially from Toshiro Mifune.The genius of Rashomon is that all of the flashbacks are both true and false. True, in that they present an accurate portrait of what each witness thinks happened. False, because as Kurosawa observes in his autobiography, Human beings are unable to be honest with themselves about themselves.

The trouble is, he doesn't really know how to go about it. When he starts courting Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a beautiful worker on the presidential campaign of politician Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), his idea of a good date is taking her to see a dirty movie. During the course of this story, he chats up Palantine, arms himself to the teeth, and makes the acquaintance of people such as Wizard (Peter Boyle), a philosophical co-worker, Iris (Jodie Foster), an underage prostitute, and Sport (Harvey Keitel), Iris's degenerate pimp.

This is because Woody Allen likes to dabble in themes such as self-discovery and the angst of relationships with others and with the self, but he frames everything in schtick, so that everything that happens is basically the setup for jokes. This works well when he sticks to comedy and satirizes wealthy Upper West Side New Yorkers, but you can't have a film about self-discovery when everything that is about to become serious deteriorates into schtick. Male directors have a long history of fetishizing actresses and trying to squeeze their female secrets out of them, and Allen is no exception. But Allen goes one further, and makes his actresses like ventriloquist dummies who adopt his own neurotic self-deprecating style. So rather than trying to get into an actress's soul, as Rosselini or Bergman did, he inserts his own soul into them and has them be him. It's a sort of vampirism. Psychologists have noted that compassion lies in the ability not to understand how YOU would feel in another person's situation, but to understand how THEY feel, as THEMSLVES, as a person who is NOT you. Allen lacks compassion in that sense, and that is a strange handicap for a writer who is attempting scripts that deal with issues of identity. His vampirism causes him to create a world where his own values predominate that is, where everyone has the hots for everyone else, and where the activity du jour is for people to jump in bed with one another. Mia Farrow's character Alice is originally drawn into this world, but in the end rejects it for higher spiritual needs (going to Calcutta, working with Mother Theresa, giving up her wealth and selfish lifestyle and servants, and doing her own cooking and cleaning). Female socialites gossip at the end of the film about her remarkable transformation, and include in the same breath the transformation of another friend who has had plastic surgery. While Allen seems to be making fun of these gossipy women, he is also shares their view of Alice that her transformation is as shallow as having a facelift. He always takes a tone of petulant jealousy in his films when women reject him in favor of something else. He seems to feel most abandoned when they are leaving him not another man, but a place where they can hide away from him in their own soul - to find themselves. His most famous films - Annie Hall, Manhattan, and others - all deal with this theme of being rejected by a woman when she goes into herself. He makes fun of women when they do this. They are seen as flaky, self-involved, being attracted to new-agey forms of self-discovery that are beneath him. For me what is really deflating about his movies is his jealousy of the spiritual center of women, and his attempt to trivialize and belittle them for having deeper souls than him. It's as if he doesn't want anyone to feel anything beautiful if he can't. For Allen, women are disappointing because they have to go on these spiritual journeys and won't just go with romance (which for him means that everyone gets to bed everyone at all times). Even where there are opportunities for something really interesting to happen - such as when characters are given a magic potion that allows them to be invisible for a time - the only way they take advantage of this is to watch other people having sex, voyeuristically gaze at models undressing, or listen to people engaging in gossip about love affairs. So nothing ever rises above the level of a sex comedy.Most viewers will miss the references in the mostly 1930s soundtrack. Over the opening credits Limehouse Blues plays, a song from the '20s about the ghetto in Chinatown In Limehouse, where Orientals love to play, In Limehouse, where you can hear those blues all day&#x85; This song is the setup for Alice's visit to the weird Chinese herbalist\/ hypnotist doctor, and plays whenever Alice visits his exotic den in Chinatown. I Remember You plays when her dead husband pays her a visit. And Alice Blue Gown plays during Alice's moments of self-discovery and over the ending credits, and may even be the inspiration for the title and character name. This song is from around 1919, and is about a girl singing wistfully about a beautiful Alice blue gown that she used to have. Here are some of the lyrics In my sweet little Alice blue gown, When I first wandered down into town, I was so proud inside, As I felt every eye, And in every shop window I primped, passing by. This indeed is the way Allen looks at his Alice character as a sweet girl proud to wear a lovely gown, primping and trying to catch men's eyes. He plays this song when Alice is going on her spiritual journey, which would seem inappropriate. It's as if he is saying that she is not a grown woman with children and her own inner life, but only a lovely young girl in a gown, a girl who exists only to be loved and admired but who is stupid enough to reject love for her own silly pursuits.In the end Allen makes fun of Alice's purity and refusal to wallow in bereft values like the others with the song, and by framing her selfless actions as a form of fanaticism. This is actually how sociopaths feel jealous of people with real feelings and real love. Allen appears to have a voracious appetite for youth and innocence, which he merely tries to corrupt.

Over the opening credits Limehouse Blues plays, a song from the '20s about the ghetto in Chinatown In Limehouse, where Orientals love to play, In Limehouse, where you can hear those blues all day&#x85; This song is the setup for Alice's visit to the weird Chinese herbalist\/ hypnotist doctor, and plays whenever Alice visits his exotic den in Chinatown. I Remember You plays when her dead husband pays her a visit. And Alice Blue Gown plays during Alice's moments of self-discovery and over the ending credits, and may even be the inspiration for the title and character name. This song is from around 1919, and is about a girl singing wistfully about a beautiful Alice blue gown that she used to have. Here are some of the lyrics In my sweet little Alice blue gown, When I first wandered down into town, I was so proud inside, As I felt every eye, And in every shop window I primped, passing by. This indeed is the way Allen looks at his Alice character as a sweet girl proud to wear a lovely gown, primping and trying to catch men's eyes. He plays this song when Alice is going on her spiritual journey, which would seem inappropriate. It's as if he is saying that she is not a grown woman with children and her own inner life, but only a lovely young girl in a gown, a girl who exists only to be loved and admired but who is stupid enough to reject love for her own silly pursuits.In the end Allen makes fun of Alice's purity and refusal to wallow in bereft values like the others with the song, and by framing her selfless actions as a form of fanaticism. This is actually how sociopaths feel jealous of people with real feelings and real love. Allen appears to have a voracious appetite for youth and innocence, which he merely tries to corrupt.

This is because Woody Allen likes to dabble in themes such as self-discovery and the angst of relationships with others and with the self, but he frames everything in schtick, so that everything that happens is basically the setup for jokes. This works well when he sticks to comedy and satirizes wealthy Upper West Side New Yorkers, but you can't have a film about self-discovery when everything that is about to become serious deteriorates into schtick. Male directors have a long history of fetishizing actresses and trying to squeeze their female secrets out of them, and Allen is no exception. But Allen goes one further, and makes his actresses like ventriloquist dummies who adopt his own neurotic self-deprecating style. So rather than trying to get into an actress's soul, as Rosselini or Bergman did, he inserts his own soul into them and has them be him. It's a sort of vampirism. Psychologists have noted that compassion lies in the ability not to understand how YOU would feel in another person's situation, but to understand how THEY feel, as THEMSLVES, as a person who is NOT you. Allen lacks compassion in that sense, and that is a strange handicap for a writer who is attempting scripts that deal with issues of identity. His vampirism causes him to create a world where his own values predominate that is, where everyone has the hots for everyone else, and where the activity du jour is for people to jump in bed with one another. Mia Farrow's character Alice is originally drawn into this world, but in the end rejects it for higher spiritual needs (going to Calcutta, working with Mother Theresa, giving up her wealth and selfish lifestyle and servants, and doing her own cooking and cleaning). Female socialites gossip at the end of the film about her remarkable transformation, and include in the same breath the transformation of another friend who has had plastic surgery. While Allen seems to be making fun of these gossipy women, he is also shares their view of Alice that her transformation is as shallow as having a facelift. He always takes a tone of petulant jealousy in his films when women reject him in favor of something else. He seems to feel most abandoned when they are leaving him not another man, but a place where they can hide away from him in their own soul - to find themselves. His most famous films - Annie Hall, Manhattan, and others - all deal with this theme of being rejected by a woman when she goes into herself. He makes fun of women when they do this. They are seen as flaky, self-involved, being attracted to new-agey forms of self-discovery that are beneath him. For me what is really deflating about his movies is his jealousy of the spiritual center of women, and his attempt to trivialize and belittle them for having deeper souls than him. It's as if he doesn't want anyone to feel anything beautiful if he can't. For Allen, women are disappointing because they have to go on these spiritual journeys and won't just go with romance (which for him means that everyone gets to bed everyone at all times). Even where there are opportunities for something really interesting to happen - such as when characters are given a magic potion that allows them to be invisible for a time - the only way they take advantage of this is to watch other people having sex, voyeuristically gaze at models undressing, or listen to people engaging in gossip about love affairs.

The ship was dragged up the mountain and then let down again just like we see it in the film, and then it was let loose down the rapids as well. Three identical ships were used. Kinski's psychopathic behaviour reached such extremes that the Indian extras hired by Herzog, shocked by the sight of Kinski's schizophrenic explosions, offered Herzog to kill that raving maniac. Herzog turned the offer down, and he and Kinski would go to make one last film together after this one -Cobra verde. Fitzcarraldo is, undoubtedly, Herzog's greatest and craziest film, and probably Kinski's most famous role.

Perfect Blue revolves around a young woman named Mima, who leaves her career as a pop singer and starts a career as an actress. While doing this, she is stalked by an obsessed fan and tormented by, what seems to be a ghost of her past self as a pop singer. This sends Mima into a deep psychological torture that may drive her off the deep end.So what are the pros of this movie? Well, the story is probably one of the best I've seen in any animated film, the editing was superb, and the music was always perfect for the present situation. The story itself can get really confusing at times, which is probably what the film is going for, but is explained in a clever manner later on. In fact, the way Mima compares the movie she's shooting to her current situation is a pretty clever idea and it sure as hell confuses the audience about what's real and what's not. Great storytelling right there.So what are the cons of this movie? While I don't hate this movie at all, I'm not gonna act like I don't have my problems with it. Luckily, there's only very few. The animation was bit choppy at times and I can imagine that it probably didn't look very good on the big screen. I do think Mima was a bit of a bimbo at times and the ending was terrible. Now I'm the real me, she says. Really? That's what this movie is ending off of? But all of these are blown out of the water by the pros.I give Perfect Blue an 8\/10 because it truly is a very suspenseful film that keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through. Whether you're a fan of anime or not, I assure you that you will enjoy this film.

While on the way to meet up with him, she checks into a remote motel run by the mysterious and mother-dominated Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn).As the story and plot were the same in this remake as in the original, it is still a movie full of suspense, intrigue and excitement. The music adaptation by Danny Elfman was eerie and haunting, matching the drama and horror elements of the film.While this movie is nearly identical to the original one, there are some updated elements including Marion's car-make, upping the stolen cash from $40,000 to $400,000, styles of clothing, and character chemistry. Vaughn did a nice job portraying Bates, as well as William H. Macy as Milton Arbogast and Philip Baker Hall as Sheriff Chambers. However, I thought Heche overdid it a little in her portrayal of Marion Crane, forcing surprised and confused facial expressions as if trying to contrast herself from Janet Leight's portrayal in the original movie. Mortensen as Sam Loomis looked like an emotionless hick who didn't seem to be moved by what is going on, and Julianne Moore murmured almost all her Lila Crane's lines quickly, and looked like she was angry at the entire town.Even with the downsides I've pointed out, this remake of Psycho is still a treat to watch - no over-the-top stuff, just the perfect balance of pure drama and horror.Grade B ","genre":null},{"date":"25 March 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a shot-for-shot remake of Alfred Hitchcock's horror classic, Psycho, where we have Anne Heche portraying Marion Crane, a Phoenix secretary who steals $400,000 from her employer's client so she could start a new life with boyfriend Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen).

Along the way, McClane must follow Gruber's Simon Says games, or else he will set off a bomb after each unfinished puzzle.

Samuel L. Jackson plays Zeus Carver, a Harlem electrician who happens to be caught in the chaos and ended up attempting to help McClane solve the case. I didn't care for his character too much; he's helpful to McClane but keeps on spouting annoying and endless racial references. Jeremy Irons plays a formidable Simon Gruber - crafty, sly and skillful, and commanding with his wicked voice. I just wished the aspect of him being Hans Gruber's brother, and the climatic fight between him and McClane, were elaborated upon more, which would have made the revenge subplot more interesting. His henchwoman, Katya (Sam Phillips), lacks some descent acting skills and is too theatrical when wielding her weapon in an attack, as in the overbearing scene where the henchmen raid the Federal Reserve with the song When Johnny Comes Marching Home running continuously in the background. Overall, it's another sequel full of suspense and thrills, with a chilling race against-time-scene towards the climax.
