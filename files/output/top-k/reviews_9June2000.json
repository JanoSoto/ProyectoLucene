Hey, what the hay, it must have been the easiest money they ever made.This film is just pure dumb story and testosterone, shaken up, and spilled out onto film.  Its first half, or even its first two thirds, moves along slowly and is agonizingly predictable.  Kip's in trouble....Kip's in trouble, is what we hear, over and over...and over, during the first half.  The last half is spent resolving this Kip problem.  You may have heard about a good car chase towards the end.  I don't know - I've seen some great car chases.  I don't think this was one of them.  Not even close.   But the last 30 minutes were definitely the only good part of this film.  And of that, only about 5 minutes were engaging.And, the BIG stunt, which we see at the end, is laughably bad - it makes the bus jump scene at the end of Speed look realistic.Don't waste your time and money, folks.

I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed by this movie.  The simple fact is, there's really nothing particularly novel done here.  The film never moves beyond the rank of a passable Summer time-killer.  There are a few funny lines, but not TOO many of them.  There are a few car chases, but for what's supposed to be an action-packed thrill ride, they come spaced too few and far between.  The acting is okay, but with the exception of Delroy Lindo as the dogged detective hot on the trail of the car thieves, nobody really seems able to rise above and really stick out from the pack; even the usually reliable Cage seems too subdued here.  We're used to seeing him as something of an every-man who turns a rather believable and resourceful super-hero in a crisis, but the script just doesn't provide the goods for him to do so this time around.All the flash and bombast that's become the trademark of all of producer Jerry Bruckheimer's films (The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon) seems misplaced in the context of this very simple story.  The scrappy 1974 original was made on a next-to-nothing budget, and actually added to the story's appeal.  It also got the job done faster and more economically (97 minutes Vs. 118 minutes)  You really feel the padding here.This new version of Gone In 60 Seconds is not a bad movie.  It's easy to watch and imminently forgettable.  Mission Impossible 2, which was released 2 weeks before this movie, is much more likely to stick in the mind (and warrant a repeat viewing) a year from now.

This could mean that the film studio simply ran out of money, or that they are just leaving room for a sequel, but either way, it is just too abrupt.Besides that, it seems that the film as a whole (and especially the first three quarters of it) draws more from Orson Scott Card's classic science fiction war novel Ender's Game than it does from Robert Heinlein's novel on which the film is supposedly based. True, the characters aren't children, as they are in Ender's Game, but their activities are virtually identical.Starship Troopers is definitely worth watching; the special effects are spectacular, the war scenes are amazing but also incredibly graphic, and even the relatively modest futuristic atmosphere is more convincing than the usual flying cars and alien-looking clothes (as in Back To The Future II).

Beyond some of the starring roles, the two productions are as different as day and night. Brian DePalma directed Mission Impossible, a puzzling, disjointed action picture leaving little to no hope for a sequel. However, the action-orientated John Woo has taken the position in place of DePalma and captures the excitement, venture, and stylish sequences with more dexterity and structure. Mission Impossible 2 is relative, involving, and swank. The film takes all too familiar James Bond components and creates a movie more similar to the licensed to kill spy than the primary contents of the television series.Tom Cruise once again stars as proselyte I.M.F. agent Ethan Hunt, recently assigned to track down a former representative who possesses a deadly biochemical substance obtained by the murdered scientist Dr. Vladimir Nekhorick (Rade Sherbedgia). The villain, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), once had an attractive girlfriend named Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), whose occupation as a professional thief makes Ethan dissatisfied when he must recruit her as a member of a mission team.After sleeping and falling in love with her, Ethan oppose the idea of sending Nyah back to Ambrose's luxurious resort to recover information of his criminal intentions. Equipped with a traceable implant, this young woman, Ethan, and his two accomplices Luther (Ving Rhymes), and Billy (John Polson), seek to discover and foil the plans of Ambrose and his accomplices.The story is clear, involving, and comprehendible; it is not so complex the audience becomes lost and attentions wander. The plot contains enough tension, high stakes, twists, and intriguing characters to keep us on edge.Mission Impossible 2 is not all story, however, much of the production has a condescending commercial appearance. The sophisticated actors, rock and roll music, intense action sequences, high tech car chase scenes, stylish camera angles, and audience pleasing one liners are more self gratifying rather than entertaining. I can almost see the producers now, discussing what battles scenes and explosions to deposit within the film's theatrical trailer; the filmmakers also need to know that external action itself does not make for a thought-provoking movie.The production succeeds mainly due to an effective, solidly portrayed villain, keenly acted by Dougray Scott (Ever After A Cinderella Story). He conquers his role with a sense of sly, fiendish wit and knowledge. Tom Cruise again proves he is more than capable of dramatizing Ethan Hunt with style and enticing persuasion. Supporting roles by Thandie Newton, Ving Rhames, Brendan Gleeson, and Anthony Hopkins are also impressive.Mission Impossible 2 accomplishes that exceptional task of actually being better than its preceding original. The success of this picture is surely due to the direction by John Woo (Face\/Off), who is one of the better action directors currently in work. His formulaic attitude presents itself in the end, however, as the movie turns from sharp and sneaky to running on sheer adrenaline through the final half hour. It really irritates me when the third act of a movie consists of loud gun shoot-outs, risky stunts, and physical combat in which men dressed in black suits fire seemingly endless rounds at the protagonist only to miss, yet he pulls out a small caliber pistol and shoots every one of them dead.

I was laughing at details at the most inappropriate times.  I never felt an emotion.  Trite.  Tripe.  Don't the people who give this film high ratings have any critical faculties at all? ","genre":"Action, Drama"},{"date":"9 June 2000","score":"","review":" The creators of the British animated classic `Wallace and Gromit' bring their magic to a full length feature. It's an ingenious little adventure that follows the hopes and dreams of a chicken named Ginger (Julia Sawalha). Her dream is to escape Mrs. Tweedy's chicken farm. She claims she can do it on her own but what bewilders her is that she is afraid for all her fellow fowl within the coop. So their plan focuses upon all of them in one huge jail-break. Ginger's prayers seem to be answered when a `flying' rooster named Rocky (Mel Gibson) drops into the coop after escaping a traveling circus. Meanwhile Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) develops a plan to turn her little farm into a massive `chicken pot pie' factory forcing Ginger and Rocky to teach all the others to fly before they become pies. What makes `Chicken Run' so ingenious was how the animators made us want to be apart of the chicken world. We fall head over heals involved with these chickens and their daily lives. Coupled with that involvement, `Chicken Run' also cleverly delivers us into a `prison breakout' movie filled with humor, and excitement. `Chicken Run' is a pure delight. For many people this will be their first experimentation with a full length animated feature involving clay. The clay for me helps reflect the tones and dimensions of the characters. In some ways I think it aids a lot in the audience's involvement in the chicken world. Placing aside the claymation and those magnificent machines, `Chicken Run' also brings back a lot of classic Hollywood moments in the films setting. There are scenes which remind us a lot of the classic World War 2 prison movies. Films like the `Great Escape', `Stalag 17' and even the misadventures of `Hogan's Heroes'. What I liked about those film references here is that they weren't here to poke fun at the films but to play homage. The references also aid the audience in diving deeper into the film and its delight. If you remember `Wallace and Gromit' then you may recall all their huge machines which helped enchant their everyday lives. From the rocket-ship to the sheep shearing machine, `Chicken Run' has these kinds of machines which have always amazed me in their transformation and assembly. How do they dream up these wondrous machines? (4.5 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.

Fact is, the drawings themselves have an incredible power in them; the facial expressions are simply perfect, and the terse, beautiful song enhances the feeling. Movie magic at its best.

And in fact, for much of the movie Hitch seemed out of his element, setting up suspenseful moments, just for the sake of having them, without having any real bearing on the plot. In fact, the plot doesn't even seem apparent until about 2\/3 of the way into the picture(which is when you're finally rewarded for enduring the first 6 hours or so). On the other hand, there's nothing wrong with a director stepping out of his element once in a while, and the characters created by Joan Fontaine(who won an Oscar the next year for an inferior Hitch film, Suspicion, in one of the Academy's most blatant make-up votes ever), and Judith Anderson(as one previous reviewer alluded to, Cloris Leachman's comical performance in Young Frankenstein was a certain homage) are among filmdom's all-time best. Obviously, Academy voters, still on a GwtW high, loved it. I personally prefer his other nominated film of 1940, Foreign Correspondant, which was more of a typical 'Hitchcock thriller'. In short, it's a solid 8 or 9 film, but it's not a 'real' Hitchcock movie(one wonders if these types of movies should have just been left in the hands of romantic directors like Fleming or Cukor).

It is hard to view a soiled life like Keitel was leading without being on the road yourself which wouldn't be pretty. The backdrop of a baseball series and Keitel losing chunks of money made it even crazier. Again I have to say absolutely great acting. Keitel has so many good scenes that this may be a career role for him. I give him a multitude of credit for taking the chance to play a totally unlovable character. Watch this movie at your own risk and know going in that this is an outlier in the sense of normal movie making. Don't bother grabbing a flashlight or even a spotlight and trying to find a plot.
