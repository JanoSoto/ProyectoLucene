In this film Lester (Kevin Spacey is very unhappy with his marriage and his job. He is constantly disrespected by his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and his daughter Jane (Thora Birch). He works for a company that he hates and longs for the day that he has the nerve to just walk out. Carolyn is a success driven real estate agent who is in constant competition with the self proclaimed King of Real Estate Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher). This causes her to neglect her husband and her daughter and lose all morals for their relationships. Jane is ashamed of what her mother and father have become and wants nothing to do with them, she finds herself feeling alone in the world with no parental guidance.Lester and Carolyn decide to attend one of Jane's school basketball games, where she is a cheerleader, and Lester finds himself daydreaming about one of the girls on the cheerleading squad who just so happens to be one of his daughters good friends. Later in the film this same girl tries to seduce Lester and this sets him on the road to redemption. Carolyn attends an event with Lester where she runs into Buddy and they decide to have lunch so that he can teach her some of his tricks in the real estate business. This lunch later turns into Carolyn and Buddy having an affair and them later getting caught by Lester. This just adds fuel to Lester's fire in his journey of becoming this man who really doesn't care what the world or his wife thinks. Jane starts dating the neighbor\/schoolmate Ricky who everyone thinks is weird and psycho. Ricky's dad the Colonel, who is a retired marine, thinks that Ricky is sleeping with Lester.The music in this film adds so much to the characters and what they are feeling. For example, there is a scene where Lester is riding down the street in his car smoking weed and he has American Woman by Lenny Kravitz playing on the radio which is a very free spirited and care free song. I thought that this song went perfectly with the way that Lester had been currently acting. The lighting in this film also played a big part in enhancing the moods of the characters to the viewers. There were scenes in the film where the mood was relaxed and mellow, during this time the lighting was very dim and subtle, giving you a sense of calm and relaxation. Mainly throughout the film there was natural lighting used, for example when Carolyn and Lester were both in their cars driving down the street there seemed to only natural sun light being used in both of those scenes.Overall the director (Sam Mendes), writer (Alan Ball) and the rest of their crew did a great job when putting this film together. I enjoyed how each actor brought the characters to life just by doing little things like facial expressions, and body language. There weren't any dead parts of the film; it kept you interested from the beginning to the end. I am looking forward to enjoying more films by Mendes and Ball.

It's just a style you have to accept and get over it.But the magic is really in those clips. Sometimes Korine misses, sometimes he creates a scene that reaches out to you in a special way that is unique to every person watching. I personally love Korine's work because I was born with a mild mental\/physical syndrome, I have a billion weird fetishes, I had a very strange mind as I child, I had extremely domineering parents, etc etc. Since Korine grew up an hour from me, he knows the culture in the South very well, and this reflects in all his films. In all, I think I actually connect with his films out of experience, not because I'm looking for something artistic. Korine is just a factor in my life who happened to pop up because of a bunch of extremely strange coincidences, and it's also in that coincidence that I like his work. If someone told me about him before I discovered the magic myself, I'd have been like 'Wtfcat'.And that's how I'd describe Julien, as well as Gummo and Trash Humpers.

He's created films that are supposed to be thrown into 50 cent sale bins so that people can pick up his mess for cheap, watch it, and laugh at it, make fun of it, destroy it afterward, set it on fire, love it, or just whatever they want. He's never made a film to make money, he makes films that are made to look like trash, and then he thinks people actually want to watch it. And well, he happens to be right, no matter what he does, he happens to make clips that make me smile.So at the end of the day, his Youtube previews are the best (someone else usually edits the Official Previews, as Korine usually does not pick great editors for the final film, and so the previews always cheer me up better).

John and Mary Klein are a happy couple who have just purchased a new house. The excitement over their new place is short-lived when they have a car accident following the purchase. Mary winds up in the hospital with a head injury, but the CT scans reveal that she has something far worse wrong with her. She eventually dies, leaving a devastated John to discover that she had been drawing sketches of moth-like figures during her time at the hospital. A year passes, and John is scheduled to do an interview for his Washington Post job. On his drive to the interview, he mysteriously winds up in Point Pleasant, West Virginia with no recollection of how he got so far out of his way. Mysterious events are plaguing this small town, events that may be connected to what happened to his wife.I first saw this way back on opening night and loved it. As someone who is really into the unexplained, myths and legends, this film is right up my alley. The story of the Mothman is one of the most fascinating I've ever come across, and while The Mothman Prophecies takes a great deal of liberty with the story, it's a terrific film all the same.I've never cared for Richard Gere, but I fully admit that he's very good here. He nails the confused, distraught mental state of John Klein, and is very believable in the role. Laura Linney is also solid, though that's no surprise. The standout, though, is Will Patton. One of my favorite character actors, his portrayal of the rugged Gordon Smallwood, an individual who seems to have a deep connection to the Mothman, is absolutely perfect. This guy rarely fails to impress the hell out of me. He just has an awesome screen presence.The abnormal occurrences throughout the film certainly produce an unsettling atmosphere. Coupled with eerie imagery and surreal filming techniques, they help the film become quite nightmarish. The use of sound is most effective as well, with all sorts of bizarre noises being heard, including the odd screeching noise that the Mothman was said to have made in some of the real accounts. We also get a moody score that's a perfect fit for the film. Just listening to the soundtrack is guaranteed to give you chills. I know from experience. Speaking of chills, one of my favorite scenes is when Klein speaks with the Mothman entity, having dubbed itself Indrid Cold, on his motel room's phone. It's a wonderfully tense scene, and Cold's voice gets under your skin.The effects of the occurrences on the small town of Point Pleasant are well explored, as many different aspects and accounts are introduced. The town itself comes off as a bleak and unnerving place. Almost lifeless. The occurrences have basically killed off the town's livelihood. Gere's John Klein becomes increasingly paranoid the longer he stays in Point Pleasant, and when his dead wife appears to the sheriff, he becomes increasingly tortured. It isn't long before he's driven to a distant and isolated state of being, much like Gordon before him.The climactic scenes do not disappoint either. The scene where Klein realizes what is really going to happen makes for a powerful moment, and the final scenes on the Silver Bridge are as tense and suspenseful as they are exciting. It's a very well-done climax, both dramatically and from a technical standpoint. A fine way to finish the film.Overall, this is a deeply eerie, surreal piece of work. Nightmarish really is the best word for it. It also has interesting characters and some emotional moments. I'm a big fan.

Oooh, spooky! I liked Amityville 3 better. At least I felt sorry for some of those characters. And Lori Loughlin was great. Why was the first Amityville a bigger hit? Because of the lie that it was based on a true story. Without that thought to creep you out, this is a pretty incompetent horror movie. I'm not one who craves blood and gore, and I appreciate more subtle, slow-building movies like The Haunting (directed by Robert Wise). But The Amityville Horror is not in that league at all. The characterization is non-existent, and the pacing... my god, the pacing. It's not a good sign when even the edited-for-TV version of this movie feels *way* too long. Was the extra time devoted to making us care about the characters? Nope. I kinda hoped they'd die, particularly the whiny kids. Especially the little girl who seemed more creepy to me than any ghostly presence that may have been haunting the house. The evidence She calmly leaves her babysitter locked in a closet and is totally immune to her hysterical screams. Oh sure, her ghost pal wouldn't *let* her open the door. But I didn't see her trying to change ghostie's mind, or feeling remorseful afterwards (or even reacting normally with fear\/disgust when babysitter comes flying at her with bloody fists). Also, Little Miss Innocent seems smugly satisfied at the thought of her dad being in danger. And *then* the little brat sends him back into the house for the freakin' dog. I'm supposed to believe this demon-child who hasn't cared about anybody else, cares about the dog? Not only that, when they're all escaping at the end, she's got a choke-hold on Margot Kidder's neck, slowing her down, while her brothers slip and slide down the bloody stairs by themselves. So why does the little girl need to be carried, huh? Evil! Oh, almost forgot right after bugging his sister by dangling a fake spider through a window, who should happen to get his hand smooshed in that window? Coincidence? Ha!Ahem. Anyway, I couldn't root for the parents either. James Brolin's possessed...by the Spirit Of Wooden Acting (An affinity for wood may explain the constant fireplace-gazing and axe-chopping). Margot Kidder takes forever to actually try to *do* something. Like, the obvious things a horror movie character should know to do right away talk to a priest and do some research about the real-life murder that took place in your house. Duh!

The Lost World Jurassic Park was a disappointment, however, and so is the third installment in the series, the pithily titled Jurassic Park III. Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), survivor of the first adventure, has continued his career as a paleontologist and reluctantly agrees to be a guide for Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H. Macy and Téa Leoni), a couple who wishes to make a trip to the dinosaur island and promise to fund Grant's researches if he comes along. It turns out they have more on their minds than just a sightseeing trip; much to Grant's chagrin. Of course, the members of the team consisting of Grant, the Kirbys, a few mercenaries and a young paleontologist named Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola) get stuck on the island and have to fight for their lives to make it to the coast and call for help.At first it looks like Jurassic Park III could be a pretty decent movie Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) from the first movie is featured in a small role and there are no annoying kids squeaking all the time (at first, that is...). Unfortunately the movie soon becomes pretty much what I feared it would be running and screaming in the dark with no sense of amazement or adventure. The story doesn't waste much time for character development or pondering the justification of gene technology and just jumps straight into action. Well, action can be very entertainment when done right, but here it is nothing that wasn't already done better in the first films of the series &#x96; the sense of adventure is missing. The dinosaur effects aren't as amazing as in the first Jurassic Park (or at least they don't feel like that anymore), although the addition of Pteranodons and communicating Velociraptors is a cool idea even if the scenes aren't ultimately as exciting as they sound like. Maybe the most effective moment in the film is the sudden appearance of a Spinosaurus after a cell phone ringtone is heard faintly in its direction &#x96; more such moments of astonishment would have been needed to make the film a good adventure.While there are enjoyable things to be found in Jurassic Park III, such as the majestic score music (even though the best musical themes are recycled from the first movie) and the charisma of Sam Neill in the lead role, they just aren't enough to make the movie a truly worthy sequel to the first JP. The Lost World wasn't great either but at least it had the fun finale on the streets of San Diego, and whereas JP3 lacks such a climax, it may entertain action-adventure fans who accept the fact that it can't be as good as the original.

He is stuck in his room with a cast on his leg and he is bored out of his mind....oops wrong synopsis. Sub Jimmy Stewart for Bart Simpson and you have your story of Rear Window. L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries suspects his neighbour has killed his own wife and tries to solve the mystery while stuck in his wheelchair. The premise is pretty simple, yet Hitchcock gives us something more with this film, he gives us exactly what our society craves voyeurism. Even to this day we can't go by without thinking or wanting or actually trying to peak into the lives of others.Rear Window marks my fourth Hitchcock film I've seen, yet it sneaks into my favourite spot. Is it boring for someone to say that one of the more popular Hitchcock films is currently his favourite? I don't care, I know a good film when I see one and Rear Window is just that. More than 50 years later this film manages to still be relevant today and hold up successfully well in the suspense department. The recent Shia LaBeouf remake Distrubia, while a good thriller, suffers from the technology syndrome. Years from now the film will be dated with that ankle bracelet technology holding Shia in, just like the giant cell phone Zack Morris carries with him everywhere. Rear Window doesn't feel dated and this is credited to Hitchcock and his attention to detail. I absolutely love, adore and cherish the art direction in this film. How beautiful is the set design? Knowing that they used the basement as part of the set design only heightens my enjoyment of it. The second floor of the apartments was actually the stage floor. Stunning in my opinion. The opening scene giving us a glimpse into the lives of the people who live in the apartments around Stewart is marvelous. We never go into their lives, we just see it from Stewarts (and our) viewpoint. We never leave his room, save for the ending and a scene that involves the death of a dog. Those close ups of the people listening to the lady yelling seem out of place because we immediately jump out of Stewart's room and into the open area. It's alarmingly jarring and seems out of place for no apparent reason.Hitchcock ones again proves us that a good story (he most certainly had his hand in crafting the story) trumps everything else. How suspenseful can a film be when our hero never leaves his room, hell he never really leaves his wheelchair. Hitchcock manages to pull it off gracefully. It's nice to see where films today get their inspiration from. When the lights in the hallway go out at Stewart's apartment, I thought of No Country For Old Men. Hitchcock truly was the master of suspense. Grace Kelly is absolutely stunning. I never really cared for the looks of the actresses of the old 50's or 60's. None of them caught my eye, Grace Kelly think is the first one to do so. I don't even think Marilyn Monroe did. Her introduction shot is graceful and most certainly memorable. I can't finish this review without mentioning Thelma Ritter. She was hilarious and everything she did felt so natural. I absolutely loved her character. Rear Window is more suspenseful today than most thrillers that come to theatres. The little glimpses into the lives of the people around the setting is what really drew me in though, the song writer, Miss Torso, Miss Hearing Aid, and the balcony couple. These are nice little addition from the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock.

This movie was directed in 1952 by Fred Zinneman. In this assignment I will be reviewing the film in whole, discussing the main character and the actors\/actresses who portrayed them and the theme. This movie includes a star studded cast of Grace Kelly to Gary Cooper. I rather enjoyed the movie. When it first started you have to pay attention to their body language because no one is speaking. Then they show the wedding of Will and Amy Kane, played by Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly. As these two are getting married word is on the way that a criminal Kane sent up state 5 years ago for murder has been set free. Everyone knows that Frank Miller, played by Ian MacDonald, is on his way to kill Kane and anyone who helped put him away. Kane doesn't let this stop him finishing what he started. I loved the twist where Marshal Will Kane's (Gary Cooper) wife, Amy Kane (Grace Kelly) shot Frank Miller's brother. She saved her husband's life. I feel the theme of this film was you should always stick up for what you believe. Will Kane put his life on the line to take down the Miller gang and keep the town safe, even when no one would back him up! Kane goes to the tavern and church to get volunteers to be special deputies but when ever someone offers to help; someone else speaks up and causes Kane to lose all the volunteers. This is certainly so in the church scene, right a way men start to stand up agreeing to help Kane until the citizens divide in half and start arguing over what's right and wrong. One woman even speaks up on Kane's behalf. She reminds them all that it is thanks to Kane that women are safe to walk the street and kids to be raised in their town. This was not only brave but showed tremendous amounts of courage. He wasn't afraid to die. I do think he felt let down by those he served and protected for all those years. No one would back him up; they kept trying to push him out of town. Frank Miller's character didn't even come in until the end of the movie, we only saw Ian MacDonald perform for the last ten minutes. Grace Kelly was beautiful and did a wonderful job as did Gary Cooper. In the end Grace Kelly's character stood by her man and Gary Cooper showed us to stand up for what we believe in no matter how bad it seems. I have to say, I think this is one of the best black and white western films I have ever seen.

I will now summarize the story, which seems allowed since the films lacks a climax or the building up of suspense. However, if you dislike being given away the clues stop reading now. Jane has been brainwashed into an ardent communist by her father, and for the rest of her life remains stuck into this pattern.

As my summary goes it tells the story of how great I find this film.The story is quite simple but also very different from other Horror films that have come before and after it.It is about a serial killer\/lake shore strangler called Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) who is trying to escape a detective named Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) a long with a couple of cops who are also trying to get Ray's friend Eddie Caputo. The Serial Killer isn't ready to die and he breaks into a toy store, transferring his soul into an innocent good guy doll named Chucky. The next morning a hard working mother named Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) skips off of work and buys the doll from some peddler who grabbed the possed doll from the toy store. She gives it to her son Andy (Alex Vincent) for his 6th birthday and Andy is loving his new toy. When Karen is asked to do overtime, her friend Maggie baby sits Andy. She puts him to bed and is then killed by Chucky cause she turned off the news. After that Chucky goes on a killing spree to posses Andy's soul so he can live again. If he doesn't, he's stuck in the sinister doll forever.After summarizing such an amazing plot, I have really grown to love the characters, the locations, the effects, everything. I'm going to go through more of the film and make my pointers a little bit deeper for why it's my favorite Horror Film.Plot\/Story, 10\/10 The Story is planned well and the characters as well as the scenes keep the story alive throughout. The story is at a slow pace and if you hate slow paced stories, then this isn't for you. But like other slow paced horror stories such as Black Christmas, this one does it perfectly. I found nothing wrong with the story.Acting, 9\/10 The actors acting out were all done well. Alex Vincet for being only 6 or 7 years old at the time just did so well, it's like he had to have the responsibility for keeping everything alive. Brad Dourif was a perfect voice for the serial killing Chucky. He did great as Charles Lee Ray as he had to be a mad man running all over the place. Catherine Hicks & Chris Sarandon also do well. These 4 actors keep the film stable and the other actors no doubt were excellent.Effects, 9\/10 There isn't much to say about the excellent effects that haven't been said already. For the late 80's, they do a top notch job at the sinister Chucky. The way they made him move, walk, sprint, kill and even jump were all done well.Scenes, 10\/10 A lot of people think that some of the scenes were silly, silly maybe but the silly scene with the voodoo joint was done well. Every scene that came around was always very memorable whether Chucky was on-screen, off-screen or his perspective, it didn't matter. The scenes were always pulled off well and some of them actually scared me the first time round.I also wanted to point my point out a little bit deeper for why this is the best Horror film. Besides it having many memorable moments, this Slasher as well as Horror had a whole new tone and level which made it much better for a change. Now don't get me wrong I love Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, etc but I think it's better when we see something else. i'm not talking about a Killer in a mask etc going after teens. I'm talking about a Doll stopping at nothing to get what he wants. And that why I found Child's Play a bit better then Halloween etc, because It was something different.I want to conclude that if you haven't seen this Slasher\/Horror film yet, you must at once.

The press has nicknamed the killer Tooth Fairy and in order to outwit him Graham must relearn to think like a killer, an ability he has tried to forget due to traumatic experiences in the past. To achieve his goal, he consults the notorious imprisoned serial killer and master of psychological manipulation Dr. Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox) who has been put behind bars earlier by Graham.Even though the now-tacky synth-driven score never allows the viewer to forget which decade the movie was made in, the overall style hasn't dated at all. Director Mann's cold and cerebral portrayal of the world of Will Graham is still effective, and the shocking scene of death-by-fire comes across as highly memorable thanks to the general focus on mood rather than violence. The more tender scenes between the murderer and a blind woman (Joan Allen), such as her caressing a sedated tiger, are very haunting and add more layers to the killer's already interesting character.It may be unfair to compare Manhunter to the Lecter movies that came out many years after it, but the Hannibal character portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in three movies has become so iconic that it's impossible to not instantly think of him when hearing the name Lecter. Even though Brian Cox looks somewhat menacing too, he is no match for Anthony Hopkins, but the role is quite small so it doesn't affect the overall quality much. The other actors do generally a good job; especially Tom Noonan looks very creepy in all of his scenes and is much more convincing in the role than Ralph Fiennes is in Red Dragon (2002), a later movie version of the same Thomas Harris novel. William CSI Petersen is also good as the main good guy.In the end, Manhunter is a well-made thriller and recommended to any fan of the Lecter books. What it loses with the Hannibal character, it wins back with Tooth Fairy and provides good entertainment for friends of serial killer thrillers.

The press has nicknamed the killer Tooth Fairy and in order to outwit him Graham must relearn to think like a killer, an ability he has tried to forget due to traumatic experiences in the past. To achieve his goal, he consults the notorious imprisoned serial killer and master of psychological manipulation Dr. Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox) who has been put behind bars earlier by Graham.Even though the now-tacky synth-driven score never allows the viewer to forget which decade the movie was made in, the overall style hasn't dated at all. Director Mann's cold and cerebral portrayal of the world of Will Graham is still effective, and the shocking scene of death-by-fire comes across as highly memorable thanks to the general focus on mood rather than violence. The more tender scenes between the murderer and a blind woman (Joan Allen), such as her caressing a sedated tiger, are very haunting and add more layers to the killer's already interesting character.It may be unfair to compare Manhunter to the Lecter movies that came out many years after it, but the Hannibal character portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in three movies has become so iconic that it's impossible to not instantly think of him when hearing the name Lecter.

I nuzzle the kind, bark at the greedy and bite scoundrels! &#x96; DiogenesLike most of Robert Altman's films, Pret-a-Porter involves a large cast of characters gathering together to put on a performance, in this case a prestigious fashion show in Paris.The film was marketed as a satire, but it really isn't. This is fashion industry as scatology, a world of sh*t in which everything is grotesque and warped. As with Diane Arbus' famous photographs on freaks, Altman deliberately blurs the boundaries between the ideal and the abnormal, the beautifully formed and the deformed, the feces and the sanitary, the inside and the outside.All the characters here are thus freaks in some way, all part of the same freakish human circus. There are dwarf attendants and magazine editors, transvestites, cross-dressers, lesbians, gays, the obese, the pregnant, adulterers, illegitimate babies, mortuary attendants, and a multitude of abrasive caricatures. Mixed in with these are the ideal bodies of the celebrities, the exposed unnatural\/natural bodies of the models, identical twins who exchange their sexual partners, film-star parodies, television personalities and original film-stars reliving previous roles.Altman then contrasts modern sex icons (Basinger, Roberts etc), with ageing, disintegrating sex icons of the past (Sophia Loren, Lauren Bacall etc), and goes out of his way to tarnish surface beauty by imbuing the film's sex bombs with abrasive personalities.The much derided abrasiveness of the film is therefore intentional. Altman isn't just dealing with caricatures, he's dealing with the grotesque. Of course grotesque art is, by definition, the least ideal form, always a war of attraction and repulsion. As such, the reoccurring motifs here are dogs, animals and dog feces. More than juvenile poop jokes, Altman's recalling the scatological traditions of Diogenes, the dog philosopher.Diogenes was associated with public outbursts and obscenity. His ragged, unashamedly dirty existence radiated disrespect and contempt for all who gazed upon him. But while he was an animal, putrid and filthy, he was nevertheless more civilised than his cultured audience. In a similar fashion, everyone in this film is held under the contemptible gaze of Diogenes, whose mischievous dog feces show scorn for an intrusive and aggressive kind of, not so much modern culture (typified by television, celebrity, photography, fame and fashion &#x96; the usual boring targets of satire), but the hypocrisy of all culture.In the film, both television and photography are implicitly connected by characters accidentally stepping in dog feces. These accidents occur in both private and public places, playfully linking the home, studio and streets with a media culture which both intrudes on privacy (exposing shameful human behaviours, foibles and frailties) and disguises these behaviours by glitzing and glamming them up. So Altman is less concerned about the fashion industry, than about what garments and technology alternatively hide and expose, the prevalence of his symbolic doggy poop serving to bring the high down low. Everything is grotesque whether you're on or off the catwalk.The film ends with a nude catwalk scene, one of Altman's most brilliant sequences. Here, models walk fully nude whilst the words You're so beautiful the way you are hum on the soundtrack. The sequence derides the commodification of beauty, serves as an admittance that humanity is as grotesque as its ornaments\/apparels, works as a dig at the fashion industry's obsession with authenticity (the true inner subject\/self, the stripped down ego or essence), and of course points toward the end result of all fashion-as-fetish-wear total, naked sex. More than this, though, the sequence suggests that there is beauty in freakishness and freakishness in beauty, which is why a strange aura of both life and death radiates from this sequence. The catwalk models are like clones, cold stick figures, one of which is pregnant. The pregnant model speaks of a mystery about birth and something new, but she is also the least sexual of the models. Conversely, the others are like zombies, dead, crawling out of a tomb, yet are beautifully sexualised.This blurring, this confusion (ugliness in beauty, beauty in ugliness) is the very point of Grotesque art. Unlike the satirist, the grotesque artist does not analyse and instruct in terms of right and wrong or true and false (satire=logical, grotesque=irrational), nor does he attempt to distinguish between these. On the contrary, he is concerned about demonstrating their inseparability. Satire generally aims at three reactions from the audience - laughter, anger or disgust - but it aims to produce these separately. The grotesque, however, produces a reaction of confusion. With satire, there is an alternation or distinction between laughter and the gross evil which arouses anger. With the grotesque, however, laughter, hatred and anger seem to meld.Beyond this there are references to Funny Face and Blow Up (guess why), and Altman re-enacts a scene from De Sica's Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow with the same actors (Loren and Mastroianni). It's like the two lovers from De Sica's film (itself a film in which Loren and Mastroianni played multiple characters) stepped out of it and resumed their tale 40 years later in older bodies. Surprisingly, the same lead actors from Fellini's La Dolce Vita also appear, adding a dark tinge to Fellini's tale of those seeking the good life.Tactics like this create a further effect. The characters lose weight, becoming flat, depth-less images. Consider when the real Elsa Klensch is interviewed by Kim Basinger who plays an Elsa Klensch character or when real celebrities like Cher and Harry Bellefonte briefly appear but yet still come across as empty, screen representations of themselves. The film paints a world obsessed with the image, but stresses that there are few authentic images. The supermodels of the 90s were clones, destratified personae, simulations of imagined and imagined bodies, part of man's ritualised games of narcissism.

Mixed in with these are the ideal bodies of the celebrities, the exposed unnatural\/natural bodies of the models, identical twins who exchange their sexual partners, film-star parodies, television personalities and original film-stars reliving previous roles.Altman then contrasts modern sex icons (Basinger, Roberts etc), with ageing, disintegrating sex icons of the past (Sophia Loren, Lauren Bacall etc), and goes out of his way to tarnish surface beauty by imbuing the film's sex bombs with abrasive personalities.The much derided abrasiveness of the film is therefore intentional. Altman isn't just dealing with caricatures, he's dealing with the grotesque. Of course grotesque art is, by definition, the least ideal form, always a war of attraction and repulsion. As such, the reoccurring motifs here are dogs, animals and dog feces. More than juvenile poop jokes, Altman's recalling the scatological traditions of Diogenes, the dog philosopher.Diogenes was associated with public outbursts and obscenity. His ragged, unashamedly dirty existence radiated disrespect and contempt for all who gazed upon him. But while he was an animal, putrid and filthy, he was nevertheless more civilised than his cultured audience. In a similar fashion, everyone in this film is held under the contemptible gaze of Diogenes, whose mischievous dog feces show scorn for an intrusive and aggressive kind of, not so much modern culture (typified by television, celebrity, photography, fame and fashion &#x96; the usual boring targets of satire), but the hypocrisy of all culture.In the film, both television and photography are implicitly connected by characters accidentally stepping in dog feces. These accidents occur in both private and public places, playfully linking the home, studio and streets with a media culture which both intrudes on privacy (exposing shameful human behaviours, foibles and frailties) and disguises these behaviours by glitzing and glamming them up. So Altman is less concerned about the fashion industry, than about what garments and technology alternatively hide and expose, the prevalence of his symbolic doggy poop serving to bring the high down low. Everything is grotesque whether you're on or off the catwalk.The film ends with a nude catwalk scene, one of Altman's most brilliant sequences. Here, models walk fully nude whilst the words You're so beautiful the way you are hum on the soundtrack. The sequence derides the commodification of beauty, serves as an admittance that humanity is as grotesque as its ornaments\/apparels, works as a dig at the fashion industry's obsession with authenticity (the true inner subject\/self, the stripped down ego or essence), and of course points toward the end result of all fashion-as-fetish-wear total, naked sex. More than this, though, the sequence suggests that there is beauty in freakishness and freakishness in beauty, which is why a strange aura of both life and death radiates from this sequence. The catwalk models are like clones, cold stick figures, one of which is pregnant. The pregnant model speaks of a mystery about birth and something new, but she is also the least sexual of the models. Conversely, the others are like zombies, dead, crawling out of a tomb, yet are beautifully sexualised.This blurring, this confusion (ugliness in beauty, beauty in ugliness) is the very point of Grotesque art. Unlike the satirist, the grotesque artist does not analyse and instruct in terms of right and wrong or true and false (satire=logical, grotesque=irrational), nor does he attempt to distinguish between these. On the contrary, he is concerned about demonstrating their inseparability. Satire generally aims at three reactions from the audience - laughter, anger or disgust - but it aims to produce these separately. The grotesque, however, produces a reaction of confusion. With satire, there is an alternation or distinction between laughter and the gross evil which arouses anger. With the grotesque, however, laughter, hatred and anger seem to meld.Beyond this there are references to Funny Face and Blow Up (guess why), and Altman re-enacts a scene from De Sica's Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow with the same actors (Loren and Mastroianni). It's like the two lovers from De Sica's film (itself a film in which Loren and Mastroianni played multiple characters) stepped out of it and resumed their tale 40 years later in older bodies. Surprisingly, the same lead actors from Fellini's La Dolce Vita also appear, adding a dark tinge to Fellini's tale of those seeking the good life.Tactics like this create a further effect. The characters lose weight, becoming flat, depth-less images. Consider when the real Elsa Klensch is interviewed by Kim Basinger who plays an Elsa Klensch character or when real celebrities like Cher and Harry Bellefonte briefly appear but yet still come across as empty, screen representations of themselves. The film paints a world obsessed with the image, but stresses that there are few authentic images. The supermodels of the 90s were clones, destratified personae, simulations of imagined and imagined bodies, part of man's ritualised games of narcissism. By the films end, even a naked repudiation of this narcissism becomes a form of narcissism.7.5\/10 &#x96; Two viewings required.

I don't think I am really suitable to give an impartial opinion on this movie, because I simply love it in an almost morbid way.

The dialogue he is given is shockingly bad, and he makes it sound even worse. The dialogue for everyone sounds less like Star Wars and more like a soap opera.

The actors have no chemistry, the romantic dialogue is awful, Padme doesn't even seem to like Anakin until the script tells her to, Anakin does almost nothing right to make her fall in love with him, Anakin acts like a creepy stalker, it's extremely cliché, and it's the most forced romance ever. I would rather watch Jar-Jar sing in Star Wars on Ice than watch this romance again. It's that bad. There are a few things that are good about the movie. Christopher Lee as Count Dooko is great, and the score is excellent. Actually change that there is only two good things about the movie. The effects are good, but there is barely a scene that doesn't use a green screen or an effect. There is so much CGI that I felt like stabbing my eyes out. It feels so artificial. Even Yoda isn't even good in this movie. Frank Oz who was Yoda in the Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, The Phantom Menace, and the Star Wars film after this just isn't very wise. In Empire and Jedi he was a very wise, and was well acted from Frank Oz. When the prequels came along Yoda lost his wisdom. He stopped being interesting, and well acted by Frank Oz. Samul L Jackson doesn't fit the role he is given at all. The characters Jackson plays in his movies are usually badmouthed and violent. So when he was put in this movie what was he to do. Star Wars is largely geared towards kids so he couldn't start dropping F bombs. So he is given a role that is the exact opposite of what he is usually given. Therefor Jackson isn't given a chance to deliver a performance. It seemed to me that he was more reading his lines than acting. So Star Wars Episode 2 Attack of the Clones is a terrible movie.
