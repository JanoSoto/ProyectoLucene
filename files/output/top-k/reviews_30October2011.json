It was co-written and directed by Oliver Stone.Tony D'Amato, the head coach of the Miami Sharks, won back-to-back championships four years ago.

When Cap is injured during a game, third-string rookie quarterback Willie Beaman goes on in his place and becomes a major star. But Beaman is mostly interested in fame and money, and he has little regard for Tony and his teammates.

Clint Eastwood co-stars as Red Garnett,a Texas Ranger in pursuit of the convict together with Laura Dern and T.J. Lowther.A Perfect World is a character study, appearing in the guise of a cops- and-robbers action picture. The movie takes place during the fall of 1963. Eight-year old Phillip Perry, the son of a devout Jehovah's Witness mother, is staying home while all the other children are out trick-or-treating. But then prison escapee Butch Haynes appears in his kitchen. Needing a hostage to aid him in his escape from jail,he grabs Phillip. Phillip curiously looks up to Butch and willingly accompanies him. Butch gets rid of his fellow escapee after he tries to molest the child, and Butch and Phillip take to the Texas highway, on the run from the cops. The cop in pursuit in this instance is Police Chief Red Garnett,riding in his sleek Populux Airglide trailer that happens to be his mobile command headquarters. On the road with Garnett is Sally Gerber, a pushy feminist criminologist, along with a creepy federal agent who is an expert sharpshooter. Butch is not particularly anxious to make it to the Texas borderline, and neither is Garnett in any particular hurry to catch Butch. As Butch and Phillip form a father-son attachment, the paths of Butch and Garnett gradually come together, in time for a final dramatic and emotional confrontation.The conclusion of the film is very dramatic that it brought tears into my eyes.It only reminds every viewer that there is goodness in every human being. Aside from the ending,the story itself was full of accurate depiction of what hostages go through and the emotional depth that are given to each characters of the story.The story was also absorbing and fascinating that never felt contrived and artificial whatsoever. It was definitely one of the best performances of Costner and one of the best films directed by Eastwood.A perfect collaboration indeed.In summary,A Perfect World deserves a perfect 10\/10 rating!!!

George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon are all actors with impressive resumes who truly know and understand the art of acting. They transform themselves fully into their characters and leave no trace of past roles. Adding to cast's slew of celebrities is Julia Roberts, whose role as Danny Ocean's (Clooney) ex-wife is acute yet powerful. Every time she enters a scene she manages to dominate it and leave a lasting mark with her soft-spoken, deep voice. The cast alone is justification to watch the film, since it is hard to imagine a bad movie with such incredible actors. The names provide an instant attraction and reason to watch and the plot and script provide a reason to enjoy the thrill. This movie takes you on an exciting adventure of an effort to rob one man's casinos in order to earn money and love. The writers George Clayton Johnson and Jack Golden Russell come up with twists and turns for every heart-stopping sequence leaving no question unanswered by the time the film is done.The Ocean's Eleven version that I chose to watch is the remake of a 1960 film starring Frank Sinatra. The plot was very similar, with the leader being Danny Ocean, and although they robbed five casinos instead of three and the names were different, overall the basis is very similar. It is really interesting to watch a film that's a remake especially when the ideas are from so long ago. The technology was so different in 2001 compared to 1960, and since technology is a key aspect to the plan of the heist I can only imagine how difficult it must have to been to rewrite a script with the modern terms and ideas incorporated, I'm sure it changed a lot of the movie, however they still very much relate and have the same foundation. The plot is set up by the divorce of Danny (Clooney) and Tess (Roberts) Ocean. Danny is a con-artist with a history of failing his wife. Once they're divorced she meets the owner of several hotel casinos in Las Vegas, Terry Benedict. Danny is finally released after his serving his prison sentence and his jealousy gets the best of him as he decides to go after Benedict. However, his plan wasn't to beat him up or slash his tires. Instead, the revenge was to rob his three Las Vegas hotel-casinos for 163 million dollars. He recruited a team of friends who were in the same business as him and all had very exact specialties to contribute to the project. Near the beginning of the movie the viewer gets to know each team member, as the viewer travels to where they each live and observe them in their day-to-day activities. They have a specialist who can fold himself up small enough to fit in a steel restaurant box, a computer hacking specialist, and a couple elder gentlemen who have been around the block and know how to play the game. The whole process of robbing the hotel is pretty unrealistic. I could never even come up with the ideas that are used and especially would never guess the twist at the end. The whole movie builds up to a scene near the end, where it is fully revealed how they completed the robbery. I found it mind-blowing and that ending scene really completes the movie by summing it all up.Throughout the whole movie the viewer feels as though they're in the dark on some matters. It seems like the plot is always one step ahead of what you may be thinking and that there is no way to catch up. They always have a plan coming and the viewer is left to struggle along as though a car is dragging them attached to a rope through loopholes and bumps in the road. While this may sound unpleasant, I would caution potential viewers to give it a chance and survive the frustration, because it is very rewarding. The feeling of mystery makes your heart pound in a thrilling way and creates a completely new genre for films with very few members. The first time through it is definitely more confusing then necessary, but watching it multiple times increases the clarity and comprehension.The clothing selections in the film make the viewer feel like a fly on the wall at a classy, upscale party. Aside from his brief stint in prison, Ocean is never seen without a crisp, expensive black suit and his cohorts are all in suits and ties. Since the heist takes place the night of a big boxing fight, the women are in long ball gowns and men in suits and tuxedos. The clothing takes away any notion of grunge that could be associated with con artist and thieves and replaces it with a look of intelligence that almost commands respect. The suaveness makes the viewer like Ocean and feel badly for him that his wife left him, even though it was completely his fault. The casino look is completed with the high rollers in tuxes, the dealers in shiny red and gold, and the other gamblers in tacky trying-to-impress clothing. Outfits are even used as disguises throughout whether it's as a casino board member, a hotel staff, or a S.W.A.T team member. It's clear that the costumes were carefully chosen in order to convey the feeling of class.In this film, the costumes make the setting and set the mood for the film rather than the other way around. They could be in a slimy basement crawling with bugs, but dressed in their suave attire and slick hair, it would look like the Plaza. The mood is created by the costumes as well, since they look like respectable men who are almost too intelligent.

Jamie Lloyd and her newborn child, fathered by Myers, escapes from the Druids who have been holding her captive and she tries to reach Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) who has now retired. Back in Haddonfield a family has moved into the childhood home of Myers, which he objects to so the killer shows up to add a few more victims. This theatrical version of the sixth film in the series went through many different changes before getting released but this review is just for what we all saw on the big screen in 1995. It's funny but I think time has been kind to it because the previous film has pretty much been destroyed by time. I've always considered this the worst in the series but after these recent viewings I might have to put this one slightly better. What makes it so strange is that the story itself is just crazy and not all that interesting. I'm sure, the freakin' Druids? That's the best they could come up with? I really don't think the film puts a good explanation to the events from part five and even worse is how the Jamie Lloyd character is carried over here. Also on hand is Tommy Doyle, the kid from the first movie but this added attraction really doesn't lend much to the story. In this version it doesn't make too much sense as to what the Druids are up to or why they needed Myers but in all honesty do we really care? The film is quite ugly to look at and I think director Joe Chappelle has to take the blame. There's no suspense to be had here and even worse is that the picture doesn't even feel like a HALLOWEEN movie. Myers has been reduced to nothing and instead of atmosphere we just get some rather graphic killings. Even the performances are pretty bad here. The young Paul Rudd doesn't do much as Tommy, J.C. Brady is a disappointment as Jamie and the rest of the supporting players just don't have much spark. It was somewhat fun seeing Kim Darby (TRUE GRIT) but she's not around for long. Pleasence, who died before the film opened, sadly doesn't get too much to do as it's obvious he was going through some poor health here that affected his speech and walk. It was still great seeing the actor here still giving it his all though. Consider where the series went from here, this was the last of the original series and it certainly goes out on a very bad note. After what this and the previous film turned into there's no question that everyone made the right decision to just walk away and try something different. I mean, where to do you after the Druids? Thankfully outer space wasn't the answer.Halloween 666 The Producer's Cut (1996) If you're a fan of the HALLOWEEN series then you know that the sixth film was released in a very butchered form but since the original release the bootleg market has been flooded with alternate versions with The Producer's Cut considered the best of the bunch. So, is the producer's cut better? Slightly due to a few changes but let's be real here. No matter which cut you watch you're still going to have to put up with a silly story, poor performances, no scares and just an all around sloppy movie. If you haven't seen either version then you might want to stop here because I'm going to get into some heavy spoilers. What does work here is the fact that Jamie isn't killed right off the bat inside the barn. I think the entire series has had a bad thing in regards to how people are killed off and I think the entire Jamie killing was way too sudden in the theatrical cut. You could argue that how she dies here isn't fair to her character but it's better than what we have in the other version. Another major plus is the alternate ending. In the original film it's Loomis who we hear screaming as Michael's body is missing, which implies that the doctor has died. I must admit that I enjoy how Michael gets destroyed in the theatrical cut more but the actual ending with Loomis living is more satisfying. Another change that often gets overlooked happens after the father has slapped his daughter. There's a very quick bit of dialogue showing his anger at his daughter and it somewhat helps explain why he's such a jerk to her. Another noticeable change happens right at the start of the picture when we have Pleasance doing the voice-over narration instead of Paul Rudd. Yet another big sequence is a flashback to the end of part 5 when Jamie is shown being kidnapped. Again, all of these help the film but there are still a few moments that don't work. I think many of the extended dialogue sequences really don't add anything to the film and the murder of the father is shortened to the point where you really have to wonder why. In the theatrical version his body ends up exploding but that's completely missing here. Perhaps they wanted a less-graphic version but if so you have to wonder why they bothered filming it at all.

A film directed by Martin Scorsese, Raging Bull is a prototypical Scorsese movie as it deals with themes of failure for a man to understand the complexities in life. Another Scorsese movie that emulates this theme is Taxi Driver. Raging Bull chronicles a prize fighter's journey through success and ultimate failures. Scorsese puts the viewer in a position to understand that in a prize fighter's mind there is no room to see the things that are happening around him. You see a man who is blinded by his insecurities of jealously and paranoia toward a woman who he is infatuated with.Raging Bull follows the life of Jake LaMotta who is a hard-nosed, stubborn, punk from Bronx, NY. LaMotta grows up in the slums where he uses his hard knock upbringing to become a boxing prize fighter who wins the middleweight championship. As the fame and money started rolling in, LaMotta loses millions as his jealously, greed, anger, and paranoia get the better of him. Before, LaMotta wins the title there's a flashback to the series of events that has resulted in present day where LaMotta is an old out of shape aspiring comedian.From the beginning, Jake LaMotta and his brother Joey are the center of controversy. Joey doubles as Jake's sparring partner and fight organizer. Everything seems to take a turn when Jake and Joey make a trip to the public swimming pool where the camera angles to a 15 year old girl named Vickie that catches the eye of Jake. Joey who reiterates to Jake that he is already married; however, decides that he would invite Vickie out for the day. Eventually, Jake marries Vickie where he becomes consumed by the thought that she is cheating on him. By his own jealously and paranoia, LaMotta goes on to use his anger and confusion to win the title and later lose it after his guilt finally is too much to handle. The movie dwindles down and after a few years Jake LaMotta announces his retirement and his plans for buying a nightclub. This leads to Vickie telling Jake that she wants a divorce and had been planning to since his retirement announcement. As things seem to be crashing down around LaMotta who is soon arrested for introducing men at the nightclub to under-age girls. LaMotta spends nights crying in his cell but eventually serves his time and returns home to New York.

Everything seems to take a turn when Jake and Joey make a trip to the public swimming pool where the camera angles to a 15 year old girl named Vickie that catches the eye of Jake. Joey who reiterates to Jake that he is already married; however, decides that he would invite Vickie out for the day. Eventually, Jake marries Vickie where he becomes consumed by the thought that she is cheating on him. By his own jealously and paranoia, LaMotta goes on to use his anger and confusion to win the title and later lose it after his guilt finally is too much to handle. The movie dwindles down and after a few years Jake LaMotta announces his retirement and his plans for buying a nightclub. This leads to Vickie telling Jake that she wants a divorce and had been planning to since his retirement announcement. As things seem to be crashing down around LaMotta who is soon arrested for introducing men at the nightclub to under-age girls. LaMotta spends nights crying in his cell but eventually serves his time and returns home to New York. Scorsese intertwines the theme throughout the movie of a man being lost within himself confined by the emotions of greed, jealously, and paranoia. In the end it all culminates in his return when he meets up with Joey where they share a nervous moment.

As it came to the top of my list again I decided to give it another go and I'm very glad I did! It's better than great, it's truly excellent! I can't say I've enjoyed a film more in a very long time! Some extraordinary characters, brilliant performances and an excellent script combine to make up one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in the 1990's by far! But enough of my praise, here's a brief summary before I praise it some more.Lester Burnham has a boring job and lives with his wife, Carolyn, and daughter, Jane, in sweet suburbia. Family life is far from happy for any of them; Carolyn is cold to Lester and he finds that hard to take. Jane doesn't find it easy to fit in and thinks her parents are freaks. She has one friend, Angela Hayes, who becomes an object of affection for Lester, much to Jane's disapproval. Things take a turn when teenager, Ricky Fits moves in next door with his repressive father, Col. Frank Fits, USMC and mother, Barbara. Ricky likes to film everything with his video camera and he eventually introduces himself to the Burnham's. He and his father are about to have a big impact on their lives, much bigger than any of them could have imagined. I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be sending me away to an asylum (again).Alongside a, now iconic, musical score by Thomas Newman, there is also a great collection of contemporary songs used in the film. Beautifully made with not one wasted scene, a rare thing these days. As far as performances go, well, nobody put a foot wrong. Kevin Spacey was brilliant as Lester Burnham and Annette Bening played his wife Carolyn to a tee! Thora Birch as Jane Burnham, Wes Bentley as Ricky Fits and Mena Suvari as Angela Hayes were all excellent! I must also give honourable mentions to; Chris Cooper as Col. Frank Fits, USMC, Peter Gallagher as Buddy Kane, Allison Janney as Barbara Fits (I had forgotten she was in it), Scott Bakula as Jim Olmeyer, Sam Robards as Jim Berkley and Barry Del Sherman as Bard Dupree.I think I liked this movie even more this time around. Since I started documenting the films I've watched, I've come to appreciate the filmmakers' art more and more. And I think it is because of this I have a greater appreciation when I see something that I can admire not only for how it makes me feel, but also for the skill of the people that put it out there. It's a film I would recommend to anyone that loves film, it is one of the best films I've seen this year and will easily make my top ten&#x85; Highly recommended.My Score 9.3\/10.IMDb Score 8.6\/10 (based on 358,207 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score 88\/100 (based on 152 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

This time out Myers is trying to track down his niece (Danielle Harris) and he won't let anyone get in his way. Despite the outrage, the Myers-less HALLOWEEN III was actually a pretty good movie but there's no question that they had to bring the legendary killer back and I really can't think of a better way to do it. HALLOWEEN 4 is quite different from the other slasher films out during this period because it tries to scare the viewers and doesn't just go for cheap gore and violence. I think the film is about as good as one could hope for and the cast and director deserve all the credit. Director Dwight H. Little does a wonderful job at building up a very strong and at times eerie atmosphere and you can sense this in the opening sequence as a transportation crew show up to transfer Myers to a different hospital. The film wastes no time cutting to the chase and the lightening and storm really helps set the film off in the right direction. It's really surprising to see how effective this movie actually is and the best moments happen after a group of people lock themselves up in a house not knowing that Myers is already in it. This sequence runs a good twenty-minutes and yet it has you biting your nails. The sequence takes it time in playing out but it really delivers one tense moment after another. This continues all the way up to the ending, which finally has Myers getting his due. You really can't help but feel as if the screenwriters got everything right as the return of Myers is perfectly played out as is his return home and of course the final. Then, of course, there's the twist ending that all horror films have to have. I won't ruin what happens for those who haven't seen the picture but it's certainly a shocker. Another key aspect is how perfectly cast all the actors are. Pleasence is brilliant as usual and it's always great having such a talented actor playing a part like this because they take it so serious and deliver strong work just as if they were in an A picture. Harris is also wonderful as the niece and it's easy to see why so many genre fans fell in love with her and continue to worship her. Ellie Cornell, Beau Starr, Sasha Jenson are all good as well and then we have George Wilbur really delivering an effective Myers. At just 88-minutes the film has a perfect flow from start to finish and when you mix in the tension and the performance you really have to tip your hat to the producers who certainly went all out to deliver fans what they wanted.

Peter Sellers plays 'Aldo Vanucci', Italy's top criminal mastermind - known as 'The Fox' - and also a master of disguise. When his cronies visit him in jail, he gives them food and magazines. Hearing that his sister Gina ( Britt Ekland, Sellers' wife at the time ) is walking the streets of Rome, he is furious and escapes by switching places with a psychiatrist. It turns out Gina is only making a movie. He wants her to go back to school, but she is determined to become a movie star. She has changed her surname to the more exotic sounding 'Romantica'. A daring bullion robbery has been pulled off in Cairo, and Aldo must help the thieves get the gold into Italy. He decides to trick the townspeople of Sevalio into thinking they are taking part in a movie, and to this end manages to secure the services of fading Hollywood matinée idol 'Tony Powell' ( Victor Mature )...At times, 'Fox' feels like an Italian version of one of Sellers' earlier British comedies, such as 'Two Way Stretch' and 'The Wrong Arm Of The Law'. Aldo shares many similarities to 'Dodger Lane' and 'Pearly Gates'. Neil Simon's script is not bad - though not among his better efforts - but it needed a director of the calibre of Blake Edwards to make it work. Instead we have Vittorio De Sica, and his heart is just not in it. As 'Vanucci', Sellers is okay, but its when he gets to impersonate eccentric director 'Frederico Fabrizi' ( pointing to his head, he says to Tony In here is my script! ) that the film really starts to becomes funny, with some amusing jibes at the expense of the neo-realism school of cinema ( of which De Sica was a leading exponent ). Giving Sellers competition in the comedy department is Mature, with a highly amusing self parody as a film star who refuses to admit he is over the hill. When he brags to his agent 'Harry' that he is a youthful forty, the man replies But your son is thirty-five!. Another asset is the bouncy Burt Bacharach soundtrack. The catchy theme song was performed by Sellers ( as 'Vanucci' ) and 'The Hollies'. 'Fox' was not a big commercial success, but now seems a decent way to kill 90 minutes, even if it does end with a somewhat uninspired car chase.The best moment comes in the final scene. Vanucci is on trial ( along with the townspeople of Sevalio ). The film is screened to the jury. It is disjointed, jumpy, with jerky camera work ( just like every major film on release these days ).

Sanders,Donald Sutherland,John Candy and Sissy Spacek with Martin Sheen acting as the narrator of the movie. It was directed by Oliver Stone.The docudrama accounts the mystery behind the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy.The brisk investigation of that murder conducted under the guidance of Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren distressed many observers, even though subsequent careful investigations have been unable to find much fault with the conclusions his commission drew, the central one of which was that the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, acted alone. Instead of satisfying the public, one result of the Warren Commission Report was that an unimaginable number of plausible conspiracy theories were bruited about, and these have supported a sizable publishing mini-industry ever since. But New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison is convinced that there are some big flaws in the investigation of Oswald, and he sets out to recreate the events leading up to the assassination. Along the way, he stumbles across evidence that a great many people had reason to want to see the president killed, and he is convinced that some of them worked in concert to frame Oswald as the killer. Among the suspects are Lyndon Baines Johnson,the next president of the United States, the CIA, J. Edgar Hoover, and the Mafia. Over the course of gathering what he believes to be evidence of a conspiracy, Garrison unveils some of the grittier aspects of New Orleans society,focusing on the shady activities of Clay Shaw.Garrison's investigations culminate in his conducting a show trial that he knows he will lose and which he is sure will ruin his career in order to get his evidence into the public record where it can't be buried again.In making this movie, Stone presented another theory that it was the conspiracy that involves the CIA who committed the crime of the assassination of the late President John Kennedy and what came out was one of the most compelling and controversial films ever to emerge from American cinema. The final film came out like a cinema masterpiece and an honest search for truth.The performances by Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones were phenomenal.Costner had a low-key but forceful portrayal of Garrison and nicely conveys the requisite grit,curiosity and fearlessness.While Jones exhibited a great complexity and emotion to the man behind Shaw.The direction was also superb as the movie was a great ride of both information and propaganda for three hours seemed quite short in this docudrama.In the end,JFK is a must-see!!!!

Kennedy.The brisk investigation of that murder conducted under the guidance of Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren distressed many observers, even though subsequent careful investigations have been unable to find much fault with the conclusions his commission drew, the central one of which was that the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, acted alone. Instead of satisfying the public, one result of the Warren Commission Report was that an unimaginable number of plausible conspiracy theories were bruited about, and these have supported a sizable publishing mini-industry ever since. But New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison is convinced that there are some big flaws in the investigation of Oswald, and he sets out to recreate the events leading up to the assassination. Along the way, he stumbles across evidence that a great many people had reason to want to see the president killed, and he is convinced that some of them worked in concert to frame Oswald as the killer. Among the suspects are Lyndon Baines Johnson,the next president of the United States, the CIA, J. Edgar Hoover, and the Mafia. Over the course of gathering what he believes to be evidence of a conspiracy, Garrison unveils some of the grittier aspects of New Orleans society,focusing on the shady activities of Clay Shaw.Garrison's investigations culminate in his conducting a show trial that he knows he will lose and which he is sure will ruin his career in order to get his evidence into the public record where it can't be buried again.In making this movie, Stone presented another theory that it was the conspiracy that involves the CIA who committed the crime of the assassination of the late President John Kennedy and what came out was one of the most compelling and controversial films ever to emerge from American cinema. The final film came out like a cinema masterpiece and an honest search for truth.The performances by Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones were phenomenal.Costner had a low-key but forceful portrayal of Garrison and nicely conveys the requisite grit,curiosity and fearlessness.While Jones exhibited a great complexity and emotion to the man behind Shaw.The direction was also superb as the movie was a great ride of both information and propaganda for three hours seemed quite short in this docudrama.In the end,JFK is a must-see!!!!

It's a true gem when you find a movie so doomed from the very beginning that what comes after can only serve to heighten the experience of a terrible movie. The acting is awful, the story is garbage, the plot makes no sense, there's no witch, no real witchcraft. I mean... just wow. And all that said, this movie was a pleasure to watch if only because a movie this unintentionally bad is just so damn fascinating.It feels like the filmmakers decided not to even bother trying to live up to the previous two films. So basically, here's the story. An old man comes into a hospital one night with serious injuries. He's terrified, incoherent, and his doctor does everything he can to care for the poor old man.But, a bland man in a suit waltz's into the hospital, kills the old man, then walks out to his car and sets himself on fire. Where DOES one buy disposable assassins? Are they cheaper than assassins who plan on living after the job to spend their money? Or do they want full life insurance coverage? Anyway, so the Doctor is so intrigued by this mystery that he completely ignores it and goes to a bar. While here he sees a commercial for Silver Shamrock masks, and get used to this annoying commercial jingle, because you'll hear it about ninety times in this movie. Also, for some reason, there's a commercial for the first Halloween on television. Why? Because the writer and director are openly mocking you. So anyway, Dr. Can't-Act is approached by the daughter of the old man who died, and she convinces him to help her investigate the murder. They see the last place he went to was the Silver Shamrock factory, and decide to go there. They get a lukewarm welcome from the locals, and decide to pose as buyers of Silver Shamrock masks, the most popular item this Halloween season. They start investigating the weird town run by Donal Cochran, the head of Silver Shamrock, and find that it's a strange kind of Big Brother controlled town.A woman staying in the room next door finds a little Silver Shamrock coin in her mask that contains a microchip. She fiddles with it and for some reason, this causes a laser to shoot her in the head, killing her, and spawning a bug in her mouth. Why? God only knows.Welcome to our first stop on the train to WTF town. Trust me, you'll know when you've arrived.

There's a fight, and the Doctor kills one of the bland men to find out he's a robot.Robots. We have Robots in a movie called Halloween III Season of the Witch. Just think about that. So the girl is captured, the doctor goes to try and rescue her, but fails and is also captured. He is brought to the control room where Cochran begins explaining his evil plan. I hope you're wearing a helmet, because this just might blow your mind. His plan He's put little microchips in all his masks that, when given the appropriate signal, will transform the heads of anyone wearing them into piles of snakes and bugs. It kills them. Now... this would sound silly for even the sillier of the James Bond rogues gallery. We have now arrived at WTF town, your baggage has turned into a cat and your passengers are all wearing tutu's. Why? f*^$ you, that's why! So Cochran ties up the Doc and puts a mask on him while delivering a villain speech that sounds like it was pieced together from a half-dozen other villain speeches. It makes no sense and gives us zero idea to what is motivation is. At one point he does say it's all a big joke, but I'm sorry, millions and millions of dollars into research for a scheme like this?

I had enjoyed the series until this point, but it's come to a point where I can't defend it anymore. Everything that was funny about the series has been run into the ground and the third film relies mostly on tired gags and an excessive amount of cameos. I'm not kidding; there are no less than a dozen cameos in this movie. The filmmakers were wise enough to realize that another film with just Austin Powers vs. Dr. Evil wouldn't cut it, so they've branched out to include a new villain (played by none other than Mike Myers, of course). This time around Dr. Evil has teamed up with the villainous Goldmember to hold the world ransom once again with a tractor beam. The two plan on using the tractor beam to bring a massive golden asteroid to Earth and colliding it into the North Pole, thereby melting the ice caps and drowning the world's nations. To neutralize Austin Powers, Goldmember has kidnapped Austin's father and&#x85;what else&#x85;taken him back in time to the 1970s to keep him secure. So now it's up to Austin and 70s blaxploitation FBI partner Foxxy Cleopatra to rescue Austin's father and save the world from Dr. Evil's latest scheme.I'm pretty sure Mike Myers and director Jay Roach had just given up at this point. There's nothing in this movie that we haven't seen more than enough in the other films. Shadow gags? Sure. An evil lair with Dr. Evil's face plastered comically on the outside? Absolutely, but this time it's a submarine. Dr. Evil's social ineptitude leading to a hilariously misnamed evil plan? He's labeled his tractor beam project Preparation H. You decide. Musical numbers? Plenty. It's all the same jokes regurgitated in a new setting. Puns, fart jokes, and an abundance of pop culture references. A Japanese businessman named Mr. Roboto? You think they're setting up for a reference to the Styx song---oh, there it is. *cue rim shot* I would've been happier if they could've at least found a way to avoid the over-used time travel plot device. It was the major plot in the first movie as Austin is a 60's swinger displaced in modern times. In the second film, a modernized Austin travels back to the '60s and confronts the lifestyle he left behind. Here, it's not even important to the story. Goldmember transports Austin's father to the '70s, Austin travels back to find him, and five minutes later all of them have returned to modern times. Done. So what was the point of even including a time travel sequence? Because this is Austin Powers, and an Austin Powers movie isn't an Austin Powers movie without time travel. Plus it was the only way to work a 70's blaxploitation character into the plot. Convenient, eh?I don't hate this movie. I was just really disappointed that they couldn't break away from the mold and try to do something fresh to keep the series alive. Everyone just sort of phoned it in here and the franchise has become a joke. How in the world did they ever get Michael Caine to agree to this film? Granted, he's one of the best parts of the movie. Seriously, a lot of people must've owed the filmmakers favors. In the opening alone, we're given Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Steven Spielberg, Quincy Jones, and Britney Spears. And this is before the movie even begins. Enough is enough. I really enjoyed the first two Austin Powers films and I would love to see the franchise continue, but only if they're going to try and make it fresh. Drop the old jokes and drop some of the old characters. I think we've had our fill of Fat Bastard and&#x85;I know I might be alone here&#x85;Mini-Me. Goldmember's already worn out his welcome as a new character. His entire character is supposed to be funny just because he's Dutch. Seriously, most of his lines are reminders that he's Dutch (Isn't that veird?). He's a one-note character. Well, two-note if you account for the fact that he eats his own peeling skin for some reason. That's funny, right? It's time to create some new characters to flesh out the Austin Powers world, even if it's just Myers in a new costume. Don't be afraid to experiment a bit, but please don't crap out another cash-grab as obvious as this one.

So now it's up to Austin and 70s blaxploitation FBI partner Foxxy Cleopatra to rescue Austin's father and save the world from Dr. Evil's latest scheme.I'm pretty sure Mike Myers and director Jay Roach had just given up at this point. There's nothing in this movie that we haven't seen more than enough in the other films. Shadow gags? Sure. An evil lair with Dr. Evil's face plastered comically on the outside? Absolutely, but this time it's a submarine. Dr. Evil's social ineptitude leading to a hilariously misnamed evil plan? He's labeled his tractor beam project Preparation H. You decide. Musical numbers? Plenty. It's all the same jokes regurgitated in a new setting. Puns, fart jokes, and an abundance of pop culture references. A Japanese businessman named Mr. Roboto? You think they're setting up for a reference to the Styx song---oh, there it is. *cue rim shot* I would've been happier if they could've at least found a way to avoid the over-used time travel plot device. It was the major plot in the first movie as Austin is a 60's swinger displaced in modern times. In the second film, a modernized Austin travels back to the '60s and confronts the lifestyle he left behind. Here, it's not even important to the story. Goldmember transports Austin's father to the '70s, Austin travels back to find him, and five minutes later all of them have returned to modern times. Done. So what was the point of even including a time travel sequence? Because this is Austin Powers, and an Austin Powers movie isn't an Austin Powers movie without time travel. Plus it was the only way to work a 70's blaxploitation character into the plot. Convenient, eh?I don't hate this movie. I was just really disappointed that they couldn't break away from the mold and try to do something fresh to keep the series alive. Everyone just sort of phoned it in here and the franchise has become a joke. How in the world did they ever get Michael Caine to agree to this film? Granted, he's one of the best parts of the movie. Seriously, a lot of people must've owed the filmmakers favors. In the opening alone, we're given Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Steven Spielberg, Quincy Jones, and Britney Spears. And this is before the movie even begins. Enough is enough. I really enjoyed the first two Austin Powers films and I would love to see the franchise continue, but only if they're going to try and make it fresh. Drop the old jokes and drop some of the old characters. I think we've had our fill of Fat Bastard and&#x85;I know I might be alone here&#x85;Mini-Me. Goldmember's already worn out his welcome as a new character. His entire character is supposed to be funny just because he's Dutch. Seriously, most of his lines are reminders that he's Dutch (Isn't that veird?). He's a one-note character. Well, two-note if you account for the fact that he eats his own peeling skin for some reason. That's funny, right?

I had enjoyed the series until this point, but it's come to a point where I can't defend it anymore. Everything that was funny about the series has been run into the ground and the third film relies mostly on tired gags and an excessive amount of cameos. I'm not kidding; there are no less than a dozen cameos in this movie. The filmmakers were wise enough to realize that another film with just Austin Powers vs. Dr. Evil wouldn't cut it, so they've branched out to include a new villain (played by none other than Mike Myers, of course). This time around Dr. Evil has teamed up with the villainous Goldmember to hold the world ransom once again with a tractor beam. The two plan on using the tractor beam to bring a massive golden asteroid to Earth and colliding it into the North Pole, thereby melting the ice caps and drowning the world's nations. To neutralize Austin Powers, Goldmember has kidnapped Austin's father and&#x85;what else&#x85;taken him back in time to the 1970s to keep him secure.

But &#x85; And Justice for All takes a cunning approach. It keeps its (frankly depressing) subject matter afloat with a continual air of irreverence, vaguely surreal in the way it never quite borders on outright comedy. You're always left wondering whether you are really supposed to be finding it funny. It is really only a slight exaggeration of the absurdity of real life.

Their antics make Pacino's impassioned outbursts towards the end of the movie seem more believable by comparison. And when those moments come, Pacino is at his charismatic best, conveying gravitas even when he is a haggard and unshaven mess.Director Norman Jewison's style is at its most simple.

It's about an author named Paul Sheldon, who gets in a car crash while heading home from Colorado after having completed his latest book. He gets injured at first, but is rescued and nursed back to health by Annie Wilkes, a number one fan of Paul's heroine Misery Chastaine, at her house where she becomes nice to him at first, but Paul realizes that he's crippled and drugged from her mercy when she forces him to write a novel about Misery. He then finds out that she's a murderer and has to find a way to escape.Everything about this movie is excellent. If I was to meet Rob Reiner and congratulate him for his amazing achievement at directing this masterpiece, I'd give it a solid A+. Kathy Bates and James Caan did a fantastic job with their performances and the story took its audiences seriously with its chills.
