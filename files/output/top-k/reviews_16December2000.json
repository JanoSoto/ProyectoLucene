[{"date":"16 December 2000","score":"","review":"  Wes Anderson is one of my all-time favorite directors and he only has two films.  Rushmore is about freedom.  The freedom to be yourself, to be unselfconscious, to let your mind roam and behave any way you want.  I feel jealous at how passionate and free Max (the lead) is.    Anderson's films celebrate the unusual among us, and not in that lame Hollywood way with drivel like Forest Gump.  The lead in the movie is a bizarre character and he is fascinating and endearing for it.  The thing I love best about Max is that he is so full of life and passion.Anderson is also a fantastic director.  The movie was shot beautifully (reminiscent of the style of The Graduate) and there was (as with Bottle Rocket) a quirky yet powerfully emotional soundtrack.  Nothing about Rushmore is conventional yet--and this is important--it never tries to shock you in a cheap Hollywood way with violence, sex, or some special effects crap.  This to me is the ultimate in film making (and any art for that matter)--it is at once entertaining, intelligent, unique, emotional, and thought provoking.  Rushmore is so rich with so many things and is well balanced between all of them.  A TEN.

When I realised it was about murderers, I was deeply surprised and very intrigued...Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has alot on her plate. It's hard enough to be a teenager, coming of age in today's world, let alone have a boyfriend (Skeet Ulrich) with raging hormones, a father whose life is one business trip after another, and still feel healthy when your mother was brutally murdered one year ago. Just when things seem to be getting back to normal for Sidney and her friends, the small town is once again plagued by a killer. Someone who is taking their love of scary movies one step too far. To survive they must follow the golden movie rules - don't answer the door, don't leave the house, don't answer the phone, but most of all, don't SCREAM.Scream is one of those movies you can watch day in, day out and never stop loving. The performances are fine, Neve Campbell is the perfect heroin, while Drew Barrymore plays Casey Becker in her gory opening scene to perfection and Skeet Ulrich is perfect for the part of creepy Billy Loomis. Kevin Williamson is a marvellous writer, his do you like scary movies? terrorising plot is amazingly convincing. And, of course, Wes Craven has done it again...A total classic, Scream fulfills in all areas.I rate Scream 10 out of 10.

Although it was far from a masterpiece, Scream 2 is just as much fun as the first movie.It's two yeas after the gruesome Woodsboro murders and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is enjoying a new life, a new boyfriend and new friends as a student at heavenly Windsor College. But that was before the opening night of 'Stab', the movie account of the horrific slayings at Woodsboro, based on the best-selling book written by Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox). Now a 'copycat killer' is one the rampage and wants Sidney dead, again. As the body count rises the pressure becomes unbearable. No one is safe, and everyone is a suspect.The great performers return from the first film - Neve Campbell is brilliant as Sidney, and Jamie Kennedy reprises his role as geek Randy perfect and David Arquette and Courteney Cox, who where rudely underused in the original, deserve credit for their more-developed characteristics. Wes Craven returns to the director's seat again, and he puts lots of effort into this killer sequel. Also, great writer Kevin Williamson reminds us how good sequel-scripts can get.A must-see for fans of the original!I rate Scream 2 8 out of 10.
