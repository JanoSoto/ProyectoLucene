Andrews has the clear advantage of an extraordinarily fine voice, so she could have done her own singing, as she did in the London cast recording. But I have trouble seeing Andrews as the ideal for the Eliza Doolittle character over the full scope of the movie. What My Fair Lady is about is the story of Pygmalion, the play by George Bernard Shaw, but also the earlier Greek legend of the sculptor who created the image of his perfect woman out of stone, so beautiful that she came alive. So the end result must be a very high ideal of perfection, grace and beauty.Now Julie Andrews is no slouch in those departments, but she lacks the extraordinary other-worldliness that Audrey Hepburn was renown for. When Hepburn played a real princess in her first starring role in Roman Holiday, she was absolutely convincing. She made the transformation from caterpillar to butterfly in Sabrina. So when Eliza goes to the royal ball and everyone thinks the former flower girl is a princess going incognito, it is heartbreakingly believable. Eliza truly has been transformed into the ideal of perfection and beauty. As much as I admire Andrews, I can't quite imagine her being as convincing in that scene. Some say Andrews earned the part for her portrayal of the role on stage, and that she got a raw deal. If that had been the end of her career, I would be inclined to agree. But look at the wonderful, dream roles she has had since, particularly the immortal Sound of Music, in which she was perfectly cast. I think being miscast can be as bad or worse than no role at all. While Andrews certainly would not have been a disaster, I think she might have been a slight disappointment. There is a big difference between a portrayal on stage, in which the audience is more willing to suspend disbelief, and on film, where every pore is five feet tall. That is probably why the wonderful, but aging, Mary Martin didn't get many film roles. Andrews might not have been as convincing an Eliza on film as she was on stage.I see some posters calling My Fair Lady an American production. Just a reminder Hepburn was not American. She was British-Dutch-Belgian. And while she came from a rich family, she grew up in starvation poverty while in Holland during World War II, which may have given her the depth to play such a range of roles, from the flower girl to princesses. I'm not saying Hepburn's portrayal of Eliza is perfect. I grew up with Hepburn as Eliza, and she inhabits the role, in my mind. But as an adult, with the closer examination of being able to watch the DVD version an infinite number of times, I do see some weaknesses in her portrayal. I doubt most people would see these in the first or second viewing. A more troubling question is whether Hepburn should have done her own singing. She had a good singing voice, and could have done a good job. You can hear her singing Moon River in Breakfast at Tiffany's. The ultimate reason they dubbed her may have been Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway. They are trying to make a musical, and most of the stars can't actually sing. To have a weak singing performance from Hepburn would have been too much. Marni Nixon could be counted on for a skilled voice match. (BTW, Nixon finally appears on screen in Sound of Music, as a nun commenting on Maria -- Andrews.) Problem solved.As to shortening some numbers, hey, this is a musical! The music is what it's about. I've seen too many musicals where they feel compelled to cut and cut to speed things up, shorten the movie. In South Pacific, the movie version cuts the Wash That Man Right Out of my Hair number down to one verse, and they really wrecked it. Brigadoon cut everything down to the minimum, and took all the wind out of the sails. With a musical, if you want to tell a story and have lots of music, you have got to make the film longer than the average non-musical; it's a big mistake to cut out parts of the story, or truncate the musical numbers. And as to the sets, the lesson I have derived from looking at many musicals is that you do not want a set that is too realistic. A musical is by nature a fantasy, because real people don't go breaking into song and dance in daily life. You need sets that are beautiful, but not entirely realistic. The 1962 remake of State Fair by Mel Ferrer, Hepburn's husband, was a disaster, and one reason was it was filmed very realistically. Guys and Dolls is perhaps the best example of non- realism, because the story was a fable, and the sets were almost like giant illustrations from a children's book. On the other hand, the movie version should not, generally, look too much like a Broadway play. Now, let's see, what would the My Fair Lady look like if the sets were a brutally realistic depiction of Edwardian London? We're talking real slums, with real horse manure.

","genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"11 October 2011","score":"","review":" Paul Newman is back to the green table to win more and more green billets, but let me ask you something, do you really need colors to know what the color of money is? Paul Newman was The Hustler in a masterpiece of character study, now he's the stake-horse and Tom Cruise's mentor in the sequel directed by Martin Scorsese. Why Scorsese? Well, Robert Rossen's film was a psychological introspection into the concepts of winning and losing, whose effects ultimately alienated Eddie's life. The thirst for victory was Eddie's obsession, and as many tragic antiheroes, it was only through after a tragedy that his soul could find redemption. In a way, The Hustler carried many Scorsesian undertones through this theme of guilt and redemption, so cherished by Marty, so it's only poetic justice if he directed the sequel.But the question is 'did the movie ever need a sequel?' I'm not asking because I didn't like the story, but I liked it less as a sequel. As an independent film featuring Paul Newman and Tom Cruise in a mentor\/disciple relationship, the film was OK in my book and provided many spectacular shots. The color of money was one thing, but these balls kicking each other kicked ass, and provided the artistic touch of the film. But as a sequel, a few things really connected this movie to its glorious predecessor, to the point I wondered why they felt the need to name Paul Newman's character Eddie Felson. After all, no reference to Bert Gordon, to Minnesota Fats, to SARAH for God's sake! All these characters sank into oblivion and any attempt to resurrect an ounce of the past vanished in favor of the plot that sinned by its unoriginality, not as a sequel time time, but as a Scorsese film.Martin Scorsese is among my favorite directors, but I'm glad I'm not blinded enough not to differentiate between what I believe to be his great and his more average work. I think he was at the top of his game in the 80's with such powerful dramas as Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, After Hours, with such a streak, The Color of Money should have been a winner, but a winner, it ain't. It' doesn't take a great director and actor to make a film, you need a story, and whatever the original intent was, I fail to see what the insights the movie was supposed to provide were, let alone on Felson whose story arc was satisfyingly closed, so I guess the central character was supposed to be Cruise as Vincent &#x85; why not? But as I was waiting for the coming-of-age aspect to finally redeem Vincent, the ending didn't give him much more depth. It's like Vincent embodied the pretentious premise of the film, that just because it's Newman, Scorsese, Cruise, Eddie Felson and pool, the mix would automatically work.Take the game that was the basis of the plot, the 9-shot, nothing against it, but when you consider the rules, you realize how short and nonstrategic it feels, as stated in the opening sentence, its all about luck, right, even luck is art, but I didn't see that in the film. The whole thing was like Pool for Dummies, quick, noisy, flamboyant, the film could have even been about bowling, all flash with no substance.

Paul Newman was The Hustler in a masterpiece of character study, now he's the stake-horse and Tom Cruise's mentor in the sequel directed by Martin Scorsese. Why Scorsese? Well, Robert Rossen's film was a psychological introspection into the concepts of winning and losing, whose effects ultimately alienated Eddie's life. The thirst for victory was Eddie's obsession, and as many tragic antiheroes, it was only through after a tragedy that his soul could find redemption. In a way, The Hustler carried many Scorsesian undertones through this theme of guilt and redemption, so cherished by Marty, so it's only poetic justice if he directed the sequel.But the question is 'did the movie ever need a sequel?' I'm not asking because I didn't like the story, but I liked it less as a sequel. As an independent film featuring Paul Newman and Tom Cruise in a mentor\/disciple relationship, the film was OK in my book and provided many spectacular shots. The color of money was one thing, but these balls kicking each other kicked ass, and provided the artistic touch of the film. But as a sequel, a few things really connected this movie to its glorious predecessor, to the point I wondered why they felt the need to name Paul Newman's character Eddie Felson. After all, no reference to Bert Gordon, to Minnesota Fats, to SARAH for God's sake! All these characters sank into oblivion and any attempt to resurrect an ounce of the past vanished in favor of the plot that sinned by its unoriginality, not as a sequel time time, but as a Scorsese film.Martin Scorsese is among my favorite directors, but I'm glad I'm not blinded enough not to differentiate between what I believe to be his great and his more average work. I think he was at the top of his game in the 80's with such powerful dramas as Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, After Hours, with such a streak, The Color of Money should have been a winner, but a winner, it ain't. It' doesn't take a great director and actor to make a film, you need a story, and whatever the original intent was, I fail to see what the insights the movie was supposed to provide were, let alone on Felson whose story arc was satisfyingly closed, so I guess the central character was supposed to be Cruise as Vincent &#x85; why not? But as I was waiting for the coming-of-age aspect to finally redeem Vincent, the ending didn't give him much more depth. It's like Vincent embodied the pretentious premise of the film, that just because it's Newman, Scorsese, Cruise, Eddie Felson and pool, the mix would automatically work.Take the game that was the basis of the plot, the 9-shot, nothing against it, but when you consider the rules, you realize how short and nonstrategic it feels, as stated in the opening sentence, its all about luck, right, even luck is art, but I didn't see that in the film. The whole thing was like Pool for Dummies, quick, noisy, flamboyant, the film could have even been about bowling, all flash with no substance.

First, Elliot Gould is a revelation as the chain smoking, wise cracking private detective living as a man out of his time in the wild 70's of LA. His under the breath come backs are so snarky and perfect, you have to love him.

Director Robert Altman tries some different things here, which really work. First, the title song which is great, is repeated throughout the whole movie in different arrangements. I've never seen that before in any movie, and it works great. The second, which is much more subtle, is the fact that the camera never stops moving for the entire two hours. Not one static shot. A ingenious device IMO. Finally, we have the supporting cast. Without being more familiar with Sterling Hayden's work other than the Godfather, and the great The Killing, his role as an alcoholic writer is so impressive, that you have to wonder if he's really acting at all.

Sort of. Kennedy portrays the indefatigable Albany machine with a mix of cynicism, respect and love. In Ironweed we see more of the underbelly of the city, but even though a dark movie, there is a love for his O Albany. Altman's portrayal of Kansas City is dripping with cynicism, but lacks the love, and only offers the blackest of humor. What's worse, there are few likable characters. We spend most of the time watching two brainless women talking incoherently, one on drugs, the other with her teeth wired together. Yet Kansas City is still worth watching, if you are a serious film buff. Everyone, I assume, loves M*A*S*H (except, perhaps, for the Koreans, who do not have a sense of humor about their own country). Nashville and Gosford Park take a bit more savvy to appreciate, but if you understand them, you will know how to approach Kansas City. These Altman movies take an almost sociological-anthropological approach to their subjects, have strong portrayals of many characters, and more or less lack a plot or center, preferring a more naturalistic unfolding of events. Robert Altman is perhaps the greatest modern slice of life movie director. So don't focus so much on the story line as on the characters and their interactions.However, in Kansas City we are introduced to what we would expect to be more of an action movie, or at least a movie with a Hitchcock type plot. This is not what we get. And the first section consists of cutting back and forth among characters and scenes that do not bear much temporal relationship, which is confusing, and distracts from trying to focus on understanding the characters. Eventually, the movie assumes temporal normality, if not linearity.The music is absolutely outstanding. Much of it seems to accurately reproduce 1930s to early 1940s jazz, and seeing it performed in its natural setting of a nightclub gives you better insight into it than merely listening on a record, which gives it a more cerebral air. However, when truly great musicians like this were really cooking, I think the room would have been quieter, out of respect and interest; that's what I have read in some jazz musician memoirs. I was surprised by the atonality of some of the Count Basie riffs on the piano, not typical Basie style. Silver plated brass instruments would not have been common back then. And Charlie Parker never played a single note in the film, as he was pretty horrible when he was 14.There are no brave heroes in this movie. There was one clueless hero, the elections official, but he lasted for about 15 seconds, before being lines up against the wall and shot (although not realistic, perhaps key to the cinematic message). The musicians are the closest thing to nice guys in the movie, but they stay strictly in the barroom, holding aloof from corruption swirling around them, even while they see much of what is going on, as do most of the blacks. In short, Altman's Kansas City is as devoid of heroes as High Noon would be without Gary Cooper, or It's a Wonderful Life without Jimmy Stewart. Yeah, it's corrupt, but what are you going to do? Make the best of it by joining in, getting a piece of the action. (In reality, not everyone was corrupt, not even all Missouri politicians.)As to the portrayal of the Tom Pendergast political machine, I think Altman over does it. I sincerely doubt a political hack would pull out a gun in broad daylight in front of a polling place and shoot an elections official. Unnecessary and stupid, and sure to make the evening papers. The Pendergast machine was corrupt, but not stupid; the corruption focused on government contracts, from what I have read. The movie's strength is showing the different levels of society and how they interact, black working class, black mob, white political elite, white trash. Its other strength is reproducing the era in astonishingly rich detail. I love movies like this that get it right, and make you feel like you are being transported back in time. The acting is great, especially Harry Belafonte. Jennifer Jason Leigh gets on your nerves, big time, but does so convincingly.Spoiler alertNear the end, Mrs. Stilton drops her medicine bottle on the ground. Your first thought is it was empty. Or she had decided to break her habit. But I suspect the real meaning, judging from her body language when she tosses the bottle down, is she was faking it, and wasn't so dependent on her medicine. If you like this movie, try Ironweed, starring Jack Nicholson and Merle Streep. It's a better movie, but Kansas City has better jazz. The jazz, alone, is worth the price of admission.

(In reality, not everyone was corrupt, not even all Missouri politicians.)As to the portrayal of the Tom Pendergast political machine, I think Altman over does it. I sincerely doubt a political hack would pull out a gun in broad daylight in front of a polling place and shoot an elections official. Unnecessary and stupid, and sure to make the evening papers. The Pendergast machine was corrupt, but not stupid; the corruption focused on government contracts, from what I have read. The movie's strength is showing the different levels of society and how they interact, black working class, black mob, white political elite, white trash. Its other strength is reproducing the era in astonishingly rich detail. I love movies like this that get it right, and make you feel like you are being transported back in time. The acting is great, especially Harry Belafonte. Jennifer Jason Leigh gets on your nerves, big time, but does so convincingly.Spoiler alertNear the end, Mrs. Stilton drops her medicine bottle on the ground. Your first thought is it was empty. Or she had decided to break her habit. But I suspect the real meaning, judging from her body language when she tosses the bottle down, is she was faking it, and wasn't so dependent on her medicine. If you like this movie, try Ironweed, starring Jack Nicholson and Merle Streep. It's a better movie, but Kansas City has better jazz. The jazz, alone, is worth the price of admission.

Except, perhaps, for Oklahoma!, Guys and Dolls, The King and I, Carousel, the Sound of Music, The Music Man, West Side Story or My Fair Lady. And then there are those who say Meet Me in St. Louis or Hello, Dolly! were the best musicals ever made, which is true, if those are the only movies they have ever seen in their lives. The big problem is that Singin' in the Rain is not a modern musical, one in which the music expresses the inner thoughts of the characters, that advances the plot, and that is not performed by actors playing actors or musicians, performing on stage. MGM never really got the hang of producing artistically great, modern musicals. They were never able to fully integrate a great plot with great music and dancing. The plot was usually a weak skeleton to hold the musical numbers together. The musical numbers often written earlier, and the writers had to strain to find an excuse to tack them on to the story line; An American in Paris is a prime example. Even the title song Singin' in the Rain had already been recycled many times by MGM. MGM spared no expense on the lavish song and dance numbers, and figured that was good enough reason for people to pay admission. MGM's musicals are mostly fluff, although perhaps the world's most magical fluff. These are stress-free shows, lacking depth, thought provoking controversy, or social message. They tend to be modified revues, the earliest form of film musical. Yet the beginning of the modern musical had already appeared on Broadway in the 1920s with Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's Show Boat. It was first filmed in 1936, and its theme was the evils of racial discrimination. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein later teamed up to produce Oklahoma! on Broadway in 1942, and then on film in 1955. Hammerstein, whose grandfather had been an opera impresario, brought much greater artistic sophistication to musicals, strongly linking the story and lyrics. Ultimately, it is difficult to name one greatest musical because they are unique and appeal to different audiences. However, if you establish the criteria of strongest story, strongest writing, most memorable music, best dancing and most lavish sets, I think there is a clear winner My Fair Lady. What gives it the edge is that the screenplay is based faithfully on Pygmalion, by George Bernard Shaw, who was the 20th century's Shakespeare (aka, Edward De Vere). (Guys and Dolls, and The Music Man would be strong runners up in my book.)And which studio made My Fair Lady? MGM? Heck, no! It was Warner Bros., the rebel, non-conformist studio -- the antithesis of MGM. Singin' in the Rain is a fun musical, and one you can watch several times before getting sick of it. It is certainly important, and a must see for film literacy, not to mention commercial literacy, such as the old Donald O'Connor athlete's foot ads.

On the other hand, this is a John Carpenter film, and that's not a tall order.It's a simple premise kid falls in love with car, car possesses kid, people start dying. In this case, it's a pitiful loser named Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon). You know the kind stringbean, doesn't have the guts to ask out a pretty girl, gets kicked around by the jocks. He's got two patronizing parents and a best friend since childhood (John Stockwell), but the chance meeting with a disintegrating rustbucket named Christine (a once gorgeous '58 Plymouth Fury) changes Arnie's life forever. Arnie has no idea his dream car is possessed and has killed since before it even left the assembly line. And Christine is a vengeful lover. When the bodies of the school bullies start piling up, a State Police detective (Harry Dean Stanton) comes snooping, and things grow dim for Arnie and his best girl.Carpenter has a knack for building a mystery around the car, as well as a general sense of foreboding whenever she's on screen. Coupled with the downward spiral of a hapless loser like Arnie Cunningham, that's what makes this a great psychological thriller. You know the damn thing's evil and you keep wondering when she'll strike. Keep's you on edge. It takes a while for Christine to get rolling, but once she does, you can't help but watch. Just seeing a car wage a war of revenge makes for a highly watchable experience.Keith Gordon is perfect for the main character. He's able to convincingly portray both a high school doormat, and an uncaring d-bag once possessed. And it's some kind of law of physics that when Harry Dean Stanton shows up, the film just gets better and better. It also doesn't hurt that Christine features both Kelly Preston and Alexandra Paul in their teen years.

What this western is, is a revelation of a western film and when it comes down to it, is a western that is most definitely worth seeing. Especially for any western fans, it would be a blasphemy not to watch this movie. This movie is a gritty western down to the bone, the portrayal of the characters is very well done as well. And a realistic portrayal at that. Clint Eastwood did not only do a amazing job of starring in this amazing movie but also proved again that he is indeed a great director even while starring in his own movie. This film is a atonement film for Clint's past work in the western genre since it deals with a person in the west trying to escape with his violent past. When I was younger I just couldn't see the greatness of this film, well I just enjoyed seeing stuff blow up and cool fight sequences back than. But seeing it now, it now I should have appreciated this movie sooner. I mean Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman in the same movie, that is all I need to say. Now I ain't saying just because a movie has phenomenal actors or actresses make it a phenomenal film but this film doesn't only have two phenomenal actors but it's a great film at that. Gene Hackman also puts on a powerful performance here as well.

Set in Italy, the Pinocchio in question is a marionette created by Gepetto and metamorphosed by the Blue Fairy after Gepetto's wish. Guided by a talking cricket, Jiminy Cricket', the puppet must learn the rights and wrongs and prove himself brave, truthful and unselfish in order for Gepetto's wish to become entirely true. Although Snow White & The 7 Dwarfs marked Disney's introduction to feature movies, Pinocchio, it's follower, is arguably the best film Disney has ever produced! The film is darker than most cartoons and will freak out every child who watches it. The scene where Strombolli, the greedy puppet expert, kidnaps Pinocchio is bad-ass and the magical Pleasure Island will touch more nerves, because it demonstrates that making a jackass out of yourself will make you feel worse. The whole work of art warns children, well any viewer, never to accept advice from strangers. Examples are shown by the foxy Honest John and his feline sidekick Gideon. Another enchanting element about Pinocchio are the representations. Being a fox, Honest John is a symbol to slyness (eat ya heart out Kubes!); Pinocchio is convinced that John is telling the truths, but is he? The location; Pleasure Island is a murkier version of Neverland. It's holiday reps allow the boys to behave badly, but the boys somehow make jackasses of themselves. Monstro, a monstrous sperm whale, could easily be compared with monster movie characters i.e. Godzilla, the Incredible Hulk and Bruce the shark. Pinocchio uses a superb voice cast; one of the actors being the famous ukulele player Cliff Edwards, who voices Jiminy Cricket and deservedly won an Oscar for the best original song 'When You Wish Upon A Star', simply the best song in the world! It apparently was an anthem for World War 2 and the lyrics depict a dream coming true, part of the subject matter. The film also had an Oscar for the best original score, and an excellently written one too, because the music creates the atmosphere, in particular, during the haunting Pleasure Island scene. Pinocchio is a very much recommended film if no viewer has viewed it yet. Attracting generations of children and loved by grandparents, this film remains a classic and is so much better than Bambi.

It is also often considered John Carpenter's best film.In the Antarctic a Norwegian helicopter team try to shoot a Husky dog where it runs into an American scientific outpost. The Norwegian seems mad so the Americans kill him. But when the Americans explore the Norwegian's base they discovery they had discovered something and everyone has died. Back at the American base they discover that the dog is really an alien who's cells can copy any other creatures. The Americans do not only have to battle a big monster but each other, as the alien is able to pretend it is human and a spirit of paranoia and distrust is fostered.As a horror it works for a number of reasons. The characters are simply men living in close quarters, playing games, watching videos, discussing what to do, getting annoyed with each other, typical people who have something extraordinary happen to them. They are not your typical horror film jerks, at least not at the beginning. The film also has a very simple but scary idea, who do you trust and when trust breaks down what people are willing to do. It is a scary idea that people you know well could end up attacking you and that a monster can take any living form. But it is not just suspect, there is plenty of gore and the special effects of the monster taking many different forms were both very well done and wonderfully gross. It is so good to practical effects, nowadays it would just be some CGI effect which lacks physicality and threat. The Thing has a very minimalistic style, there are only seven characters, the whole film is mostly set within the base and the freezing outside, it makes for a claustrophobic atmosphere knowing that there is no escape. Even the music is kept to a simple, using only a few notes or chores and only one instrument is used at a time added to that Carpenter allowed no music at all some key scenes, having more impact and surprise then a musical cue telling the audience how to feel.Acting wise only really Kurt Russell and Keith David (who has an awesome voice) notable members of the cast, doing a decent enough job. Everyone else seems to blend into the background. But overall no one was terrible and overall The Thing was a very well made horror film.
