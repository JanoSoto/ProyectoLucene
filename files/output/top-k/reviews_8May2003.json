Even though Tobe Hooper injects some of his usual style into this film, the final product looks so patently Spielberg-esque that it's hard for me to even digest it as a horror film. That said, Poltergeist is typically juvenile as Spielberg films go, with a heavy degree of emphasis on a family coming together through a rough situation (much like E.T., Jaws, or Empire of the Sun) and a lot of the stuff as expressed through the point of view of a child (much like Jurassic Park or A.I. Artificial Intelligence).  I'd have to say that this came much to my dismay, as this film certainly works best children or adults who have somehow retained a childlike innocence all through their years. Spielberg's best two films were his first two `horror' films Duel and Jaws.  Most of his subsequent work is so excessively juvenile in execution that it's hard to understand how he maintains his status as perhaps the only celebrity director.  It's a pretty sure bet that he called the vast majority of the shots in Poltergeist, with Hooper placed mainly as a stooge to do the more technical stuff and to take all the blame if the movie tanked.  In a sense, this totally ruins what could have been a really good movie.There's certainly some good effects put to use and some genuinely frightening concepts such as the killer tree, living door, the imploding house, and giant mouth opening up in the wall, but overall they fail to really instill any real horror as they never really seem too menacing.  This is probably due to Spielberg's hesitance to show the world as anything less than totally `goody-goody', as best expressed by how he makes old people seem all ethereal and all knowing (compare the presentation Tangina to all the old folks on display in Spielberg's ultra-corny segment on Twilight Zone the Movie).  Real horror could have been accomplished had anyone ever actually been harmed or killed over the course of the movie.  The best chance would have been with James Karen's character, who's clearly the villain and the most deserving of a horrible fate (at least as would be most foreseeable in a typical Spielberg flick &#150; as Spielberg always has to take some `old white guy' and make him the only evil character).  The ending fails to even kill him off, even though he's just standing around pretty much just waiting to be killed.  It's so infuriating that I almost wanted to climb into the film and just slap the `poltergeist' in the face.  Not only does it fail to kill anyone, but it doesn't even seem to have the ability to injure people, making me wonder what the hell all those characters were scared of in the first place.Had Tobe Hooper really been in charge and in full Texas Chainsaw-mode, this could have been a lot more functional of a horror film, well at least something as effective as say, Funhouse.  A little bit of a sense of menace and a lot less of Spielberg's cutesy-poo vision of the world would have helped this movie in providing more than cheap, superficial scares, and might have been one of the scarier movies ever made.

The sight of Charles Bronson grinning cheerfully as he explodes a remote control explosive device in a man's hand, sending the poor fella up in flames, is simply disgusting.The whole film is just a re-run of previous entires.

Not satisfied with that, he then has her murdered, provoking the ever-resourceful Bronson to take up his weapons of mass destruction for one more killing spree.I don't want to spoil the film for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I will venture to say that the ending involves an industrial acid bath and is one of the most sickening and violent climaxes I've ever seen.

The more experiences one has lived through, the more they would get out of this movie.  I think to  understand loss, one must have known love; to understand courage, one must have known fear. To start with, I was beginning to think Hollywood couldn't make a movie without filling it with smokers and foul language.  I liked the fact this movie was relatively free of such things.  I know movies imitate life, and sometimes that okay, but movies also serve as a role model for our children to a certain extent. My favorite in the movie was Harry Trimble (Martin Landau) for a couple of reasons.  First, I think he hit the nail right on the head when he said `.there's magic all around you, the trick is to see it.'  I think that's a good philosophy to live by.  What's wrong with looking at life through rose-colored glasses just a little. The second reason I liked Harry was he makes us appreciate the love that should exist between a parent and child.  Having served with and around the military for over 40 years including two years in Vietnam, I saw both fathers and sons die in Vietnam.  To really appreciate such a loss, one must really appreciate the love and value of a loved one.  For instance, think about all the hours spent raising, loving, and caring for a child reading with them most every night, sickness, soccer practice, homework, playing catch, braces, etc. and I could go on but I think you get the message.  To lose someone so dear must have caused tremendous pain and grief.  With Harry, he gets a second chance at life.  I can't help thinking what I would give to have a second chance to talk with Grandma once more on her front porch. I was also impressed with Jim Carrey (Luke\/Pete).  I used to think Jim was just another comedian trying to act.  But when I saw him in the movie `Lair, Lair', I realized he was capable of doing some serious acting.  My favorite part of him in this movie was when he gave the speech in front of the committee.  I thought it was real.  Having taught for several years at a military school, I recall when I first started teaching.  I was not born with a gift for gab.  I feel Jim (Pete) came across just as I might have, trying to find the courage and right words in front of all those people. The speech also reminds us that we all need to think about what we're fighting and dying for.  Remember all those nights reading with your child. Is the cause great enough for him or her to die for? The best I save for last.  I thought Adele (Laurie Holden) was the glue that held this story together.  She is so beautiful and your heart goes out to her when she first walks into the diner and realizes Luke doesn't recognize her.  Imagine the sense of loss and heartbreak.  My favorite part of the movie with Adele has to be the one of her in the red dress at the dance. Can you imagine having to leave that to go fight a war?  Now that would take more than courage, I think! In summary, The Majestic goes down as one of my all-time favorites.  Sure, you could find holes in it if you tried hard enough.  But for me, the movie was full of magic, all you had to do was look for it.  I might add that the soundtrack is full of feel-good music.  My 8 year old grandson is inspired to play the piano after listening to it.  His favorite is the `Boogie Woogie Stomp' by Jim Cox and he loves to sing along to Nat King Cole's Orange Colored Sky.

We pick up the story where Gilot meets Picasso with the intention of becoming his student.I was slightly interested in this film as it seemed to have a high quality cast.  I must admit that I have little interest in art and have a very limited knowledge of the work and life of Picasso.  However I was open to learning and I hoped this film would enlighten me in some way &#150; either in his work or his life.  The film's focus is Picasso's private life rather than his work, this was an odd decision not to weave any of his work into the film in a significant way but it didn't put me off.  What DID put me off was the fact that the film didn't involve me to the degree I had hoped it would.  I'm not a consistent fan of Merchant & Ivory films simply because, unless they get it bang on (Remains of the Day) then they do leave me feeling a bit cold.  Here that detached feeling was what I had the whole way through &#150; I never felt for any of the characters or situations and never really got involved in the film, it was simply on in the same room as I was sitting more than me watching it.It's a shame because the film is beautifully made &#150; for all their faults, Merchant & Ivory films usually get that right.  The sets and locations add to the film and are well shot.  The cast is the main reason for watching this.  Hopkins does very well in the lead and is running free for much of it.  It confused me that I couldn't manage to link to his character &#150; maybe I was watching Hopkins act as opposed to seeing the character.  It's ironic that his best performance for Merchant & Ivory was the total opposite of this in Remains of the Day (controlled, low key, subtle).  McElhone is partly responsible for me not feeling involved in the film.  I felt she was too cold, too emotionless and not expressive enough in the lead female role.  Good support is given by Moore and others, and Ackland is good as Henri Matisse.Overall this is not as awful or boring as some would have you believe &#150; Hopkins performance saves it from being that.  But it did not involve me at all &#150; I was left quite cold to it even though the passion in Hopkins' performance made me think I was missing something.

Still with me?Meet J.D, this is Christian Slaters character in Heathers, Slater gives the kind of performance that makes you wish he got cast in 'dark' roles more often. J.D has spawned numerous fan websites and is arguably the greatest teen movie character ever. His lines are spot on and the one scene right at the start of the film where he pulls a gun on the two main school bully's\/jocks still brings a smile to my face.Heathers takes the teen flick concept and ads a new twist. The school characters are perfect right down to the cool kids inventing a new way of speaking just so they stand out even more. You have the nerds, the jocks, the rich kids, the popular kids, the fat victim etc all your standard teen groups are here and happily bouncing along to the beat that life has given them no matter how shallow or cr*p it is.This is where most movies just continue, and where Heathers excels. Enter J.D, J.D represents everything that every kid ever wanted to do or say and didn't. Not so much a spanner in the works more a bomb!This film has pages and pages of great quotes and the acting from it's 2 stars is exceptional, Winona Ryder has not made a better film (neither has Shannen Doherty)and the supporting cast play their small but oh so important roles to perfection.The only pre 25's who will not get this movie are the rich spoilt teens who are oblivious to real life because daddy has always bailed them out or given them everything that they ever wanted (much like the 'rich kid' social group in the film). And as in the film they are largely irrelevant anyway.Everyone else you must see this movie at least once, it is a classic. You may not love it but you will definitely have an opinion on it.One quote for the road . . .In Prayer Hi, I'm sorry.

The characters are great, there's Dr. Frankenstein, (that's Frahnk-en-steen!), who wacky hair, obsessed nature, and habit of speaking loudly as if no one else can hear him, Igor, the bug eyed, hunch backed minion, who may just be the funniest character in the film, Inga, the often ambiguoisly seductive German assitant, Elizabeth, Frankenstein's prissy and vain girlfriend, and of course, the monster himself, who despite having very few lines is very funny with his confused fumblings, and being quite angry with everything.

In its transition to the big screen however, most of the intricate cold war plotting didn't make it to the lifeboats. In its stead you have the basic story and of course the bank breaking poster promise of the doomed liner rising from her watery grave. It might have worked too had the source material been handled a little better. The screenplay is pretty talky and never really succeeds in building the necessary tension but what really sinks (sorry) the whole enterprise is direction from Jerry Jameson so moribund and lifeless, you'd think he was helming a movie for cable television. Its a mark of this that although it doesn't take very long to find the ship itself on screen you could be forgiven for thinking that you began watching the movie in 1912. Also RTT! has, for the most part a cut price look that undermines the epic scale of the story and its subject matter. When the ship does eventually see the light of day its via some model work and camera over-cranking that fails in producing that all important wow factor. To be fair though there are some very good shots of the ship entering New York harbour that do pack a punch, aided enormously by one of John Barry's best ever scores - a wonderful bombastic orchestral suite that is as good as hes ever produced. Were this a better film, and had anyone gone to see it Barry may have been in line for an Oscar (which he got when he plagiarised parts of the score for Out of Africa). In fact, its fair to say that Barry is the only person behind the camera who does the story any justice.Richard Jordan gives a good performance as Cussler's hero Dirk Pitt and there's a nice Cornish Cameo for Alec Guinness but everyone else is really just waiting to die here. The twist is a good one but is handled poorly and you're left wondering what a director like John McTernian who did such good work with Clancy's Hunt for Red October may have made of the same material. Sadly the discovery of the real ship in two pieces has scuppered any remake possibilities so this is it. Raise the Bismarck anyone?

The movie is unique because of its use of different camera techniques to make the viewer seem like you are really in the movie.  The first example of this is at the very beginning of the movie when the camera is shown looking though a door crack as the trial is ending.  Alfred Hitchcock could of chose to show the faces and the courtroom setting but didn't.  The reason he did this is to make the camera more like what you would be seeing.  This makes the movie believable and draws the viewer in right away.  One other way in making the audience feel like they are in the movie is shot reverse shot.  This is used throughout the movie but you first see it at the end of the party when the two main characters are talking.  The shot reverse shot makes you feel like the main characters are addressing you.  The close ups on their faces is the way you would be seeing the actor\/actress if you were sitting across from them.   When the two main characters are driving down the road you also see a camera shot that we have not seen so far.  The camera is showing the road ahead.  This is done not only to show that the lady is drunk but to give the viewer the sense that he is in the car too.  Three other times when the camera is used to emulate the audience actually being in the movie is when you see through the woman's eyes when she is driving and gets hair in her eyes, when she is suffering from a hangover and her vision of the male main character rotates, and when she is drugged and her vision starts to go black before she passes out.  All of these instances make you feel like you are experiencing what she is.  Besides the use of camera shots to make the audience more involved with the movie.  A great use of objects and camera shots were used to relay messages.  The most dramatic of these is when the male main character leaves the bottle of wine behind after he gets done hearing what the assignment is for the female main character.  Having the wine bottle left shows the change in the frame of mine.  The male main character was filled with thoughts of the two main characters having a wonderful night together.  After hearing the news every thought that he might have had is no more.  Much like the wine is no longer an issue or a concern.  The only thought now is them being split apart before they even come together, and the dread of what he has to tell her.   One other use of this was the scene when the key reapers on the key chain. No words are said but you know what is being thought as you see the close ups of the husbands face as a close up of the key on the key ring.  This close up used to build up tension is also used in the basement when the husband is looking at the bottles.  A close up is used to show the importance of the shot and a sense of suspense as the camera slowly goes from one bottle to another until the date is different. Then the finding of the broken bottle and without a word the audience knows that the husband is aware his wife is a spy.  The use of the close ups also is used to tell things that the actors never reveal themselves for example, it is never said the poison will be put in the coffee but you know with the first close up of the cup that is where the poison is.  The use of close ups also helps to instill the false stereotype of the Germans in this movie.  The Germans are depicted as cold heartless killers and this is supported by the close ups of their stone cool faces lacking any emotion. The best example of this in the movie is the end. There are quick cuts to the Nazi's faces as the two main characters are walking down the stairs.  Depicting them as heartless and ruthless killers even the mother was shown to be evil. If someone had to base all of their German knowledge from this movie the person would most likely be scared to death if they had to meet one.
