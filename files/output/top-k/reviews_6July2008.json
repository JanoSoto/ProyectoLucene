Being an American-made movie, you have to expect it to be at least a LITTLE bit slanted towards the States, but this one went WAY OVERBOARD!!!!And just so we're clear, this entire review is my opinion of the story itself, not America's fight in the Revolutionary War. I have nothing against the U.S.A. Only the movie.One of the worst parts was when Mel Gibson (Benjamin Martin)'s son is shot by a sadistic British Officer who, after shooting the young guy, says I hope you've learned something about loyalty. (OH PUH-LEASE! Does it get any more disgusting than this? p.s. speaking of loyalty, guess who got tarred and feathered when they refused to take the Pledge of Allegiance to the United States of America just a few years later? Of course, it didn't mention that in The Patriot. The slaves seemed pretty content too!)And then there was the part where one of those very people (the Loyalists, or Tories as they were called by the Patriots or Rebels.) was being ordered to burn a church full of people, by the same sadist (Jason Isaacs was actually pretty good in this one! He has a talent for playing the evil dudes). This happened in World War Two.Another scene showed Benjamin Martin and his young sons attacking a group of 20 or so British soldiers. When one of the men tries to run away, Martin pins him down on the ground and beats him to death. Who's the bloodthirsty one now? (I know that they murdered those men because they were their enemy, but for gosh sakes, at least wait for them to DO something before you ambush and kill them! Those guys were somebody's husband and father too.)I think most people realize that a lot of the stuff in this movie was for entertainment rather than education. And come to think of it, it IS an action movie, not an historical documentary.

Sometimes REALLY creepy. And who really knows what sorts of evil characters a carnival might bring into your town. That kind of thing. And working in close proximity to the State Fairgrounds, which I do, I often see these types a little bit too up close and personal for my liking each Labor Day week. The people we see at the carnival in this film bring a new meaning to the word creepy, though. The story here might not be completely original, but it somehow seems fresh. The film boasts decent production values, and a colorful cast of mostly unknowns. Top it off with a great horror film director, and we almost had a classic here.The story details four young people who visit a carnival and stupidly decide that it would be cool to spend the night in the funhouse after things close down. These four have been smoking weed all night, and maybe that was what caused this incredible lack of judgment. With all of the crazy characters they had met by the time they made this decision, one just simply cannot believe anyone would have done this. Oh, well. They decide to stay, and tragedy soon follows. The ornery drunk who runs the funhouse has a mutant retard for a son who kills a woman after a disastrous attempt at sexual intercourse with her for the price of $100. The four kids, hiding in a loft above, witness this and understandably try to leave. Too late. The father comes back and locks them in. Further complicating matters is the fact that one of the kids stole all the money from the old man's strongbox. It's safe to say that these four kids will not be allowed to leave the facility alive. The old man sicks his mutant son on these teens, and the resulting carnage is very frightening, and not overly gory.The film scores big points for atmosphere, acting, and suspense. You really feel like this is a real carnival full of freaks and geeks. You never know what will be around the corner of each tent, or who will jump out at the actors from the periphery. The opening scene is a wonderful homage to both Psycho and Halloween. Maybe even a slight nod to Kubrick's The Killing. I swear the kid's mask in that scene is a dead ringer for that worn by Sterling Hayden during the heist. The film loses points for their concept of the monster. The mutant son has a good back story, but they didn't create him correctly. Actor Wayne Doba is clearly wearing a mask and it just looks too over-the-top. I would have suggested just making his regular face look ugly with makeup instead of creating this ludicrous mask with fangs whatnot. Doba has the movements this character would make down perfectly, but when he shrieks or cries out, you can tell he's doing it through a mask! It just looks and sounds too fake. Maybe you won't mind as much as I did, but I think the physical appearance of that character needed a different concept.Overall, the film is worth the price of admission, though. I'll give it 7 of 10 stars. Kevin Conway as the midway barker and funhouse proprietor gives a particularly strong and creepy performance. If you thought carnies were creepy before, you really will think they're creepy after watching this! The Hound.

The performances are all great with Jason Scott Lee and Lauren Holly doing a splendid job as Bruce and Linda, giving a convincing portrayal of two people fighting against the odds to work together, Robert Wagner also excels in his brief role as the movie producer from hell. The score by Randy Edelman has since become one of the most famous ever produced and has been used in countless movie trailers for inspirational movie stories, every time I hear it, it seems to embody the very nature of triumph over adversity, just as much as Beethoven's ninth, which is high praise indeed.

Sometimes there's a hint of 'James Bond' or 'Mission Impossible'. It's unbelievable, but most of what you want to see is done with skill and flair. I would have preferred Hackman in a more intelligent and studious guise, and a less comical role from say Morgan Freeman or Denzel Washington. However, Washington had already done that conspiracy thang in the subtler (and I think, superior) 'Pelican Brief'.Still, there's plenty to keep your interest going.

However, he returns with good news, he is hanging up his sword, the Green Destiny, up for good and seeking out the supposed simple life.

Why can't they make sci-fi\/horror movies like this anymore?! A strong story, a claustrophobic atmosphere, a superb cast, and one of the coolest creature creations to come out of Hollywood. It's tough to find someone who hasn't already seen this film and it's harder to find someone who didn't enjoy it. The story revolves around the 7-person crew of the NOSTROMO, a commercial space vessel towing a refinery back to Earth. Halfway home, their journey is interrupted when they receive a possible distress call of unknown origin from a nearby planetoid. A quick investigation leads to some of the most memorable movie moments when their ship is soon terrified by a seemingly unstoppable alien.I first saw this movie on cable when I was around 11-12 years old and I remember the scene with Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) scouring the lower decks in search of Jones (the cat) when he first encounters the full-grown xenomorph alien; that one scene scared the crap out of me and it officially hooked me for life. The entire movie has a cramped feel with set design that gives you the feeling that the creature could pop out from any bulkhead at any moment. Honestly, the set design is probably one of my favorite aspects of this film. Unlike some science fiction films where everything is clean, shiny, stream-lined, etc, Scott's film has a realistic, gritty, lived-in feeling that makes the movie feel more grounded in reality (which makes the danger feel that much more ominous). And you can't mention the design of this film without mentioning the contributions of H. R. Giger; the man is a surrealist genius and this movie would NOT have been the same without his cooperation.The cast of this film did a fantastic job at bringing this film to life. The chemistry between the 7 crew members feels genuine and it's definitely easy to believe these people have been stuck on a spacecraft for years with each other. John Hurt, as the doomed Kane, was great and I can't imagine how different things would've been if the part had gone to Jon Finch as was originally set. Tom Skerritt and Veronica Cartwright both contributed strong performances while the chemistry between Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton made for some great moments. My absolute favorite characters in this film were Ash (played by the ever-awesome Ian Holm) and, of course, the iconic Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). From the very beginning, you can tell there's more to Ash that what he lets on and Holm does a great job of giving those subtle hints to keep you suspicious of his intent. And Sigourney, well, she just rocks. Ripley has become a film icon as a head-strong, capable, female lead and Weaver was the perfect woman for the role. The animosity between Ripley and Kotto's chief engineer Parker made for some tense moments and she even managed to carry the movie on her own towards the end.And finally, the Alien itself. It is one of the coolest creature designs for a movie ever, courtesy of H. R. Giger. It's sleek, slimy, look with it's trademark extendable inner mouth have made this one of the most memorable monsters to grace the big screen and spawned three direct sequels.

I don't know if I'm even capable of tackling all the things wrong with it--like the fact that the casting director appears to have pulled names out of a hat, or the mind-blower of Richard Gere's character being allowed to walk away scot-free at the end (I'm sure the people saying, It's just fiction, who cares would have no problem if it was a former Al-Qaeda operative who just wants to return to his home country)--so I'll just devote my review to the utter hilarity, which is mainly the scene where Bruce Willis is testing out his gun. In the original version, you'll recall, the Jackal practices his kill on a pumpkin. The pumpkin explodes on impact, an effect known as understatement. In THIS version, Willis sets up a pumpkin target, but he doesn't use a sniper rifle--he uses a gigantic remote-controlled cannon which costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored in the back of a huge conspicuous minivan (this man likes a challenge). He reveals the cannon by pulling away a tarp, at which point Jack Black, who is there to observe, jumps around and says, That ROCKS! This thing ROCKS! about 18 times (I guess Willis didn't have to disassemble it first, he just lifted it, tarp and all, out of the back of the van, despite it probably weighing several tons). The scene then turns into an Austin Powers movie as Willis misses the pumpkin and takes out a tree, then has Black run through the mud with his pants falling down, finally blowing off Black's entire arm. The pumpkin falls to the ground, unharmed. If I can recommend this movie for ONE non-ironic reason, it's for the Diane Venora character as a tough Russian major who becomes romantically linked to Gere despite having a facial disfigurement--a bold move for a Hollywood feature. By mid- movie I was really liking this character, so it was a shame when she had to be killed. I would have liked to see a movie about her.

What's the point? Why go to the trouble? And not just a re-make... one that is intentionally almost identical, shot for shot and line for line, to the original. The director says it was an 'experiment.' I thought it was perhaps intended to be like a Broadway show that is revived with a different cast. They do that all the time and people don't have a problem with it. Why should a film be any different? I'm not sure why, but it is. Maybe because it's committed to film and thus has a kind of permanence to it. The scene-by-scene re-creations are extremely variable. For instance, the famous shower scene is a complete botch. It hasn't a tenth of the intensity of the original, almost as though they knew they couldn't get it right and just said, the hell with it, let's get it over with and move on. I know as I watched this version of 'Psycho,' my main interest or curiosity was in thinking, I wonder how Anne Heche will deliver the next line. After a while, I grew less and less curious. Sometimes, with a truly great movie, people will make the well-intentioned observation, That movie stands up every bit as well today as when it first came out. You could make it today and not change a thing. I don't believe that anymore, not after having seen this. The first scene's dialogue strikes me as very awkward, not at all the way two people in that situation would talk now. This doesn't take away from the original; we watch it, knowing it takes place in 1960 and our minds make allowances for that. You could even argue that it adds to the film's charm. To set the remake in 1998 and yet have Anne Heche recite the same lines Janet Leigh did just doesn't work. (And that begs another question... why bother to update it to present day?) Speaking of Anne Heche, she doesn't seem very comfortable with the material, or even particularly interested. Heche's main expression looks to me as though she wonders what she's doing here. And Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates? I don't think so. It might be good for laughs at a frat party but nothing more. In fact, the 'impersonations' of these two characters veer closely to parody at times, not intentionally I don't think, but parody nonetheless. The other characters are 're-imagined,' you might say, by the actors playing them. William H. Macy comes off best as the detective Arbogast. He's not trying too hard and he's the only one in the film whose performance is up to standard; it's as though he's acting in an ordinary film, which is good. Viggo Mortensen turns John Gavin's straight-arrow Sam Loomis into a mumbling space cowboy. And Lila Crane as played by Julianne Moore is no longer an insistent worry-wart, she's an in-your-face hothead. Generally, the new portrayals are more distractions than improvements. Especially since the dialogue is approximately 98% the same as the original. So the film is one of those that probably seemed like a good idea late one night over drinks, but the end result leaves you shaking your head. I'm surprised somebody didn't say, a few days into the actual shooting, you know, we ought to forget the whole thing.

He's not trying too hard and he's the only one in the film whose performance is up to standard; it's as though he's acting in an ordinary film, which is good. Viggo Mortensen turns John Gavin's straight-arrow Sam Loomis into a mumbling space cowboy. And Lila Crane as played by Julianne Moore is no longer an insistent worry-wart, she's an in-your-face hothead. Generally, the new portrayals are more distractions than improvements. Especially since the dialogue is approximately 98% the same as the original. So the film is one of those that probably seemed like a good idea late one night over drinks, but the end result leaves you shaking your head. I'm surprised somebody didn't say, a few days into the actual shooting, you know, we ought to forget the whole thing.

Considering that the story was written by her sister, Hilary, and her brother, it is certain that there is a lot of subjectivity to it--but this still didn't make this a bad film. However, as several people looked rather bad in the film (such as Jacqueline du Pré herself and her famous husband) and others looked more innocent (such as Hilary's husband--who is apparently NOT quite the nice guy he seems to be in the film), it's not surprising that the film ruffled a few feathers. This really is a shame, as I'd love to know the true facts behind the story (from a totally neutral source) although despite possible flaws, the film style and acting are marvelous and this film is exceptional.One of the elements of this bio-pic I really enjoyed was the non-linear film style. Instead of a by-the-books retelling of the story, after showing the early lives of the two musical prodigies, the film shows what happened from Hilary's perspective. Jacqueline comes off as rather selfish and possibly schizophrenic in this segment. However, when the story later backs up and shows Jacqueline's story, you realize that there is much, much more to the story and Jacqueline is more of a pitiful person--someone you can't help but feel sorry for and care about--though in the first section she was far from likable. This was very creative film making and I love when films like this and HE LOVES ME, HE LOVES ME NOT show an entirely different perspective that help the viewer to see a whole new context for the first half of the movie.I also really appreciated Emily Watson's performance, though I must admit it was hard to watch at the end without shedding some tears. Her performance was clearly the standout one in the film and was truly compelling. Additionally, the rest of the performances all around were excellent and quality abounds with this film.There's a lot more to this film, but I really don't want to spoil it any more than I have. Give this one a look--it's well worth it. By the way, this is NOT a film for little kids--the subject matter and content are rather adult at times and it's best to leave this one for an older audience.

I remember how horrified I was to see the massacre at Washita Creek the first time; one hears of events like that or reads about them, but actually watching an event like that the way it might have happened had a lasting impact on me. Another film of the era that also dramatized the sheer horror of men at war and senseless killing was Patton, which also came out the same year as Little Big Man. These were among the first films I saw that de-sanitized the inhumane aspects of war and genocide and showed them for what they were, truly brutal and insane sides of the human condition.There's another holdover as well; I've used my summary line above quite often over the years, and had forgotten the origin of it until watching the film again yesterday. Chief Dan George was simply magnificent in the picture, he conveyed the Indian philosophy perfectly in scene after scene and is probably my favorite Native American actor. I'm always intrigued by Indian names, and along with Old Lodge Skins, my favorites from this story include Shadow That Comes in Sight (Ruben Moreno) and Burns Red in the Sun (Steve Shemayne). The one very unique idea presented in this picture had to do with the notion of a homosexual Indian as portrayed by the character Little Horse (Robert Little Star). I'm sure I would never have given that a thought after watching hundreds of Westerns, it just never came up before. The other trait that I'd never encountered was the idea of a 'Contrary', the Cheyenne Younger Bear (Cal Bellini) who did everything backwards, sort of the Bizarro version of the Red Man. This was one Western that made you think outside the stereotypes.Now I have to admit, some of the scenes done for comedic effect seemed to go way against the grain of the movie as a historical drama. Perhaps most representative of that was Jack Crabb's 'Soda-Pop Kid' characterization. In fact, Jack's life went through so many highs and lows that it's almost impossible to imagine that all of it could have happened to one person in a single lifetime. Given a choice, I think mine would be getting my back washed by Faye Dunaway. You know, by some strange cosmic serendipity, another 1970 Western featured a similar scene. In The Ballad of Cable Hogue, the roles are reversed and Jason Robards gets to wash the back of Stella Stevens in what must have been an extreme exercise of sheer will power. I wonder which film maker thought of it first.You know, I've seen a few treatments of Custer's Last Stand, and read with interest some of the other postings for this film regarding General George Armstrong Custer. Some were heated in their denunciation of Richard Mulligan's portrayal, but from what I've read about Custer, he was fairly ego-centric to the point of being megalomaniacal. I thought Mulligan brought the kind of audacity to the role that Emilio Estevez brought to his portrayal of Billy the Kid in Young Guns. He oozed a supreme self confidence that totally fogged his judgment leading to one of the great military disasters of American History. Along with 'Sometimes the magic works', Custer's 'poison up from the goo-nads speech' is one of the most memorable scenes in the picture for me.It would be tough to come up with another movie that raises so many conflicting emotions in the viewer, and I think that's a particular skill of a good director. Arthur Penn did a superb job of blending dramatic and comedic elements together in a story that's as thought provoking as it is entertaining. I'd recommend Little Big Man to anyone who would like a different kind of movie, one that takes the stereotypes and stands them on their head in support of an intriguing and downright offbeat Western.

Kim Cattrall, and Steve Guttenberg Police Academy is a 1984 comedy film directed by Hugh Wilson, and starring Steve Guttenberg, Kim Cattrall and Leslie Easterbrook. It grossed approximately $146 million worldwide and spawned six sequels.SUMMARY A new mayor has announced a policy requiring the police department to accept all willing recruits. Not everyone in the police force is happy about the new changes. The main character, Carey Mahoney, is a repeat offender who is forced to join the police academy as an alternative to jail, a proposal by the officer who has been lenient on Mahoney due to knowing his father. Mahoney reluctantly agrees to this and decides that he will get himself thrown out. However, the chief of police, outraged by the mayor's lowered requirements, decides that the new cadets should be forced to quit rather than being thrown out. Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris, who trains the cadets, agrees with the plan and employs tactics to make their lives as miserable as possible so that they do in fact quit. Mahoney tries many schemes to get thrown out as he cannot quit, as part of the deal made with the officer said if he quit, he was going to be sent to jail. However, toward the middle of the film he decides to stay for good having fallen in love with Karen Thompson, a fellow police cadet played by Kim Cattrall. While in the academy, Mahoney becomes friends with fellow cadets Larvell Jones, Eugene Tackleberry, and especially, Moses Hightower (played by former pro football great Bubba Smith), a quiet giant of a man, after helping him prepare for the critical driving test. After passing, Hightower is very thankful to Mahoney. Unfortunately, Hightower gets himself thrown out of the academy because of an incident when, after fellow cadet Laverne Hooks has been racially insulted, in which he lifts and turns over a police car with the hated cadet Copeland inside. Soon later, Mahoney gets involved in a lunchroom brawl caused by Copeland and Blankes, and takes the blame for throwing the first punch, which finally gives Lt. Harris the green light to expel his most despised cadet. Before Mahoney actually leaves the premises, however, a major riot breaks out downtown. The resulting police emergency forces the cadets into real action for the first time. During the riot, a tough outlaw manages to steal two cadet revolvers (one from Copeland and the other from Cadet Blankes). The outlaw grabs and disarms Lt. Harris by surprise, taking the officer to the roof of a nearby building as a hostage.QUESTIONS Why did Despite his troubles with Harris did Mahoney try to help him? Why was Mahoney taken Hostage? Who suddenly appear on the rooftop in street clothes? Did Mahoney and Hightower graduate from the Academy? Why did Mahoney and Hightower receive commendation? What was inside the podium hiding? MY THOUGHTS Now thoughts about this movie! It wasn't a bad comedy, but it did lack the things that can keep your attention. However there was one actress that caught my attention and that was Leslie Easterbrook. She was the only reason to keep watching this movie. She a very lovely actress and I hope to see her in the future movies. Based on the fact that Leslie was in this I give this 7 weasel stars.

She a very lovely actress and I hope to see her in the future movies. Based on the fact that Leslie was in this I give this 7 weasel stars.

Kim Cattrall, and Steve Guttenberg Police Academy is a 1984 comedy film directed by Hugh Wilson, and starring Steve Guttenberg, Kim Cattrall and Leslie Easterbrook. It grossed approximately $146 million worldwide and spawned six sequels.SUMMARY A new mayor has announced a policy requiring the police department to accept all willing recruits. Not everyone in the police force is happy about the new changes. The main character, Carey Mahoney, is a repeat offender who is forced to join the police academy as an alternative to jail, a proposal by the officer who has been lenient on Mahoney due to knowing his father. Mahoney reluctantly agrees to this and decides that he will get himself thrown out. However, the chief of police, outraged by the mayor's lowered requirements, decides that the new cadets should be forced to quit rather than being thrown out. Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris, who trains the cadets, agrees with the plan and employs tactics to make their lives as miserable as possible so that they do in fact quit. Mahoney tries many schemes to get thrown out as he cannot quit, as part of the deal made with the officer said if he quit, he was going to be sent to jail. However, toward the middle of the film he decides to stay for good having fallen in love with Karen Thompson, a fellow police cadet played by Kim Cattrall. While in the academy, Mahoney becomes friends with fellow cadets Larvell Jones, Eugene Tackleberry, and especially, Moses Hightower (played by former pro football great Bubba Smith), a quiet giant of a man, after helping him prepare for the critical driving test. After passing, Hightower is very thankful to Mahoney. Unfortunately, Hightower gets himself thrown out of the academy because of an incident when, after fellow cadet Laverne Hooks has been racially insulted, in which he lifts and turns over a police car with the hated cadet Copeland inside. Soon later, Mahoney gets involved in a lunchroom brawl caused by Copeland and Blankes, and takes the blame for throwing the first punch, which finally gives Lt. Harris the green light to expel his most despised cadet. Before Mahoney actually leaves the premises, however, a major riot breaks out downtown. The resulting police emergency forces the cadets into real action for the first time. During the riot, a tough outlaw manages to steal two cadet revolvers (one from Copeland and the other from Cadet Blankes). The outlaw grabs and disarms Lt. Harris by surprise, taking the officer to the roof of a nearby building as a hostage.QUESTIONS Why did Despite his troubles with Harris did Mahoney try to help him? Why was Mahoney taken Hostage? Who suddenly appear on the rooftop in street clothes? Did Mahoney and Hightower graduate from the Academy? Why did Mahoney and Hightower receive commendation? What was inside the podium hiding?

Now most major cities has become an maximum security prison. Now in 1997, New York City has become an top security prison. Since some of the most dangerous criminals in the world are sent there for live, although there's some good people find themselves stuck in that prison. When an Air Force One crash landed in the middle of the city, while the President of the United States (Donald Pleasence) escaped from a pod but the president finds himself quickly kidnapped by criminals. The New York Special Police needs a man, who knows his way around the city and without getting caught. Bob Hawk (Lee Van Cleef) sends a former Special Forces turned Career Criminal (Kurt Russell) named Snake Plissken. They asked him to find the president in 24 hours or less, if he succeed to become a free man or die. But once, Snake finds himself in the city. He finds the mission more difficult than he thought and he's running against time.Directed by John Carpenter (Assault on Precient 13, The Fog, Halloween) made an entertaining, dark, futuristic Sci-Fi adventure with plenty of action and dark comedy. Russell is terrific as the anti-hero Snake Plissken. Which that character remind one of the most popular cult figures of the movies of filmmakerCarpenter. Oscar-WinnerErnest Borgnine, Oscar-WinnerIssac Hayes, Harry Dean Stanton, Adrienne Barbeau, Season Hubley, Frank Doubleday, Tom Atkins and Charles Cyphers in memorable supporting roles as well. For ambitious low-budget project, this feature is well produced. Since the special effects still looks good with great model work and excellent matte paintings. Which it's one of the best looking movies in the 1980's. Escape from L.A., i felt the special effects has dated much more than this picture.From the Two Disc DVD Special Edition Set.The first DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.351) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc 1 includes the original Laserdisc commentary track by directorCarpenter and actorRussell. Which it is certainly one of the most enjoyable commentaries around. There's an new commentary track also by the late Debra Hill (The Dead Zone, The Fisher King, World Trade Center) and production designer Joe Alves (Jaws 1 & 2, Close Encounters of the Third Kind). Disc 2 includes an new featurette with the cast & crew, the long awaited Deleted Scene with optional commentary by Carpenter & Russell, Photo Gallery and more. Although the special features in Disc 2 are good but they are disappointing short. I wish the featurette was much more longer. All those special features from Disc 2 could have been fitted in disc 1 for sure.Escape from New York is still great looking movie for all over the years. Because the intriguing premise still works, there's great character moments from the cast, the visual style is outstanding and the music from John Carpenter and Alan Howarth is memorable. The sequel Escape from L.A. is watchable but it's much campy version of the original. Now there's rumors of the upcoming remake of the original with Josh Brolin being a possible lead role for Snake Plissken. Since the three previous Carpenter remakes were not so successful in storytelling or at the box office (The Fog remake was the worst). I think Escape from New York is Carpenter's third best movie. My favorite from Carpenter is Halloween and The Thing. I just wish Carpenter would make a movie soon, it's been too long since Ghosts of Mars. If you haven't seen it but heard of this for many years. See it now, you won't regret it. Written by Carpenter and Nick Castle (The Boy Who Could Fly, Dennis the Menace, Mr. Wrong). Listen closely to Jamie Lee Curtis' narration in the opening sequence.
