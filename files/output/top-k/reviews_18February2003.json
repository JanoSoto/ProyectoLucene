There have been many such movies in the past; most notable being Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Ripley will join their rank.Anthony Minghella has taken great pains to recreate the 1950's Italy and the spirit of the 50's. His use of music as a continuous thread tieing up the macabre events underlines the essentially restless nature of the three main characters. The repressed homosexuality and the fear of facing the truth are marvellously expressed in the story of Ripley who actually lives the life of another (and effectively kills Ripley's identity in the process). The director is to be congratulated for not attempting a Ripley-is-finally-caught kind of ending that would have completely destroyed the film and diverted the attention to a mere technicality.I would have liked to see some more time given to the depicting of the squalor of Ripley's New York existence, because that would shed more light on Ripley's character; why he did not leave Italy after killing Dickie, why he was attracted not only to Dickie but also to his lifestyle, etc.A very satisfying and intelligent film.
