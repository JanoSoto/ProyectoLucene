Of all the wonderful motion pictures Kubrick directed over the years The Shining is the one I've seen most often. Nevertheless it's simply impossible to grow tired of this enjoyable and unforgettable classic because at least I can't find a single fault in it. Floods of blood from the elevator, sights of two dead little girls, boy who has an imaginative friend talking through his finger Kubrick's terrific masterpiece is filled with dark visions and frightening ideas that makes it the biggest and the most amazing horror film of the movie history. If I would have to name one thing that's common in almost all of Kubrick's films it's the interesting fact that they look more like a filmed dreams than a traditional movies.And usually those dreams turn out to be nightmares. Dreadful story, wild acting and especially the maniacal camera-work creates the same impression with The Shining too. Blood-curdling The Shining may not be Stanley Kubrick's finest film because there's always gonna be the brilliant A Clockwork Orange but that doesn't make it any less perfect. As I said, it's definitely the very best horror movie in the history of its genre - I haven't seen anything that comes even close to its effectiveness. If there wouldn't be a film classic called One flew over the cuckoo's nest the furious role of Jack Torrance would also be Jack Nicholson's greatest performance ever. Movie contains some of the most memorable horror movie moments. Here's Johnny! and Redrum, redrum! are just few of the legendary one-liners we remember from horrifying The Shining. I've seen this film so many times I could say that if there's a film that's extremely familiar to me it's this one. But I still haven't figure out what the hell the last picture, the very last shot of this movie means? My rating is absolute 10.
