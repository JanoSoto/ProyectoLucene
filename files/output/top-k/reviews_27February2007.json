Extremely Angry and annoyed, I decided instead to attempt a review of Jurassic Park, which very well could be the first movie that had an actual impact on me.Here's a very short synopsis (I'm not a big fan of giving away elaborate plots for movies). The film is about a theme park called Jurassic Park, which is like a zoo with genetically engineered dinosaurs. A group of experts are invited to the island that the park is on, to give it a test tour and give the place their stamp of approval. But when a spy from a rival company shuts down the park in an attempt to steal dinosaur embryos, the creatures break out, and plenty of awesome Spielbergian-Action and Effects ensue.I have read the book by Michael Crichton (one of my favorite authors) which is better than this film, slightly, but the movie will always personify this incredible story. Steven Spielberg is my favorite director along with Peter Jackson, and this is truly one of his best films. In fact, this was the movie which introduced me to both Spielberg and the concept of the blockbuster. What a defining moment!!! The effects are extremely, incredibly, monstrously, astonishingly...my god, I cannot think of the right word. This film was THE movie which forever implanted the memory of Computer Generated Images into the public's head, and I still am in absolute awe of the creatures in the films. Seriously, Spielberg deserves a million extremely hot woman for what he has done with this picture. An absolute piece of art.The actors are very good as well. Sam Neill brings a likability and intelligent nature to Dr. Alan Grant, and, being a big fan of character arcs, I really liked how his character changes throughout the movie. Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler is lovely and smart, and she deserves to become a star in her own right. The children who play Tim and Alexis Murphy fit their part nicely, never becoming too annoying or cute.As for the other actors, they are fine, but not truly great. But i really don't want to make this a negative review, so I'm just going to skip the bad stuff, of which there is extremely little.In the end, Jurassic Park and it's incredibly entertaining sequels (I can't wait for the fourth film) are truly great works of cinema from the greatest entertainer alive, Spielberg, and if you haven't seen it, I advise that you get your lazy rear over to a rental store, and soak in every beautiful aspect of this special effects masterpiece.9\/10.

Everything comes good in the end. The hero learns a valuable lesson about life, his divorced parents are reunited, the vicious stray dog becomes a friendly puppy, the pain-wracked vegetable in the wheelchair manages a coherent sentence and everyone has a good old laugh.

Usually, the box for Allen is considered to be tragic-comic takes on neurotic personalities in modern Manhattan. But a film like the Purple Rose of Cairo displays his gifts at spinning stories that are unexpected and, actually, really delightful. Years before he made Everyone Says I Love You, which was also a big 30's Hollywood homage, Purple Rose of Cairo was a nifty take on the separation between fantasy and reality (or as one of my friends calls 'magic realism') and how it relates to the depression and the escapism inherent in those fluffy romantic adventures. Cecille (Mia Farrow) is the one who takes the full trip down the movie-hole, so to speak, when she meets Tom (Jeff Daniels)- except that Tom is a movie character, who's seen Cecille so many times seeing him in the movie that he walks off the screen and falls in love with her. But things are complicated by two things- Cecille's brutish, one-track-minded husband (Danny Aiello), and the actor who's really playing Tom, Gil, who also falls for Cecille when he comes to town to rectify the situation. Meanwhile, the Purple Rose of Cairo's characters, on the screen I mean, seem to be completely unable to function.What Allen has best of all in this film is a deft ability to mix sensibilities all within a wonderfully fantastical backdrop. If anything else it also reminded me of was the recent Pan's Labyrinth, where a little girl left the dire problems of the real world, also with a brutish figure of ugly masculinity, and when in the fantasy world, even a flawed fantasy world, it's much more inviting than what the real world has to offer. But the question comes for Cecille, as it did for Ofelia in the other picture, how to balance the two, and what really should not be taken for granted. Can Tom really provide true love for Cecille, or Gil, or her real husband? Probably none completely, which makes up the sadder part of the picture. But Allen also has too much warmth going on, in humor as well as his affection for the up-front plastic appeal of 30s movie characters and atmosphere, to make things sour for too long. Farrow's totally empathetic as the waitress-turned-apple-of-Tom\/Gil's-eyes, who brings out a really touching feeling in a viewer during the last minutes of the film, as she looks up at the screen and provides what Allen claimed *was* his happy ending. Daniels is also excellent in one of his best turns as a figurehead of innocence (i.e. when Tom's invited to the whorehouse) as well as Hollywood pragmatism that gets peeled away slightly. And Aiello, in his minutes on screen, adds that perfect level of crushing realism needed for the period.With a few unforgettable Allen moments, like when Cecille herself goes into the movie (and one character's self-realization after discovering the wonders of, gasp, improvisation), or when Tom can't pay for a meal cause he has 'movie-money', Purple Rose of Cairo is one of those fuzzy but rare treats in the movies where we're reminded why we go to the movies in the first place. It's a fable that's also rare for the filmmaker to take on, but as a sort of challenge he makes it one of his most charming and well-crafted films.

Scorsese's fans call this the best shot ever. As I said, it's a long shot of a fellow getting a table. Kubrick did great tracking shots too, but the key to a great tracking shot, like any shot, is that it communicates something significant to us, puts us in the state of mind of the characters, etc. But this was just some people walking to their table.

There was mention of the Depression Germany and the rest of the world was in and all five of the principal players were affected by it, one way or another. John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, Greta Garbo, Wallace Beery, and Joan Crawford all check into the Grand Hotel one day and their lives are never the same. Greta Garbo is the temperamental Russian ballerina Grusinskaya and her artistic tantrums are getting less and less tolerable in many ways because of the Depression. John Barrymore is the aristocrat now living in genteel poverty. His world ended with World War I, but the Depression reduced him to being a sneak thief. Lionel Barrymore is the terminally ill bookkeeper who now just wants to spend his last days living it up. He's just going to ignore the Depression. Wallace Beery is the Prussian industrialist who's used to high living having married the boss's daughter, but his firm as so many others is about to go under unless he can pull off a merger. Lionel Barrymore is one of hundreds who work for him and know what an extremely little man he is, that Beery is really lacking in any real ability for business. Finally there's Joan Crawford who's a working class girl, hired as a stenographer by Beery who has other things on his mind for Crawford.Whether in Germany or America Joan Crawford is the eternal shop girl. To her credit she does not attempt any kind of a Teutonic accent and her performance rings true. This is in complete contrast to Susan and God where she was consciously trying to imitate Gertrude Lawrence from the stage. This was the Depression in America too and many could identify with her.No one epitomized class and old world elegance like John Barrymore, he was not better on film than here in Grand Hotel. He hates the life that poverty has reduced him to. Using his old world charm as a facade for being a thief tears him inside. Meeting Greta Garbo gives him a last chance at redeeming his life.Garbo's performance is one of her best as well. I'm not sure any other actress could have made you sympathize with the temperamental ballerina. In the hands of anyone less skilled, the audience would have sympathized with the management of her ballet company who want to can her. When John Barrymore enters her life he's like the audience she entertained over the years rolled up in one person who still cares about her the individual. It's a last chance for happiness for her as well.Wallace Beery had a funny thing not happened to him in Grand Hotel which I won't reveal might have been quite comfortable with the regime to come in Germany. Beery is the only one in the film to attempt any kind of Germanic speech and he does succeed in his portrayal of the hateful industrialist Preysing.My favorite in Grand Hotel has always been Lionel Barrymore. Lionel may very well have been the most talented in the Barrymore family. Playing the gentle, terminally ill Kringelein is light years different from Mr. Potter in It's A Wonderful Life or Captain Disko Troup in Captains Courageous. Three very different roles yet Lionel Barrymore imprints his personality on every one. A meek little man, he's got courage enough now, courage that comes when you have absolutely nothing to lose.Grand Hotel is now 75 years old. The style of acting you see here is old fashioned indeed, no one could remake Grand Hotel today in the same style. It's melodramatic, but it works.

I don't want to sound harsh, i recommend this film all the way. In a strange sense all of the negatives of Batman meshed with the dark purple backdrop gloom and merely emphasized further Nicholson's brightly colored clown get-up and Richter scale ham-fest.

Its too much though, and it gets annoying. You find yourself gasping for some fresh air by the end of the film. Burton's very heavy hand and his very Burtonlike vapid storyline and dialog are all borne gladly because of one thing; Nicholson's unbelievable one man show. In fact, his performance utterly carries the film past the embalmed forgettable non-performances of the rest of the cast, with the exception of perhaps Palance. I don't want to sound harsh, i recommend this film all the way. In a strange sense all of the negatives of Batman meshed with the dark purple backdrop gloom and merely emphasized further Nicholson's brightly colored clown get-up and Richter scale ham-fest. Its movie magic as they say. Jack deserved more credit for this. It's the type of award winning acting that sadly never receives awards. Boo.
