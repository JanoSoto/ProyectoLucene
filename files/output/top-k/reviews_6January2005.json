Most of the time this means that you'll watch a mediocre TV-movie (at best) that should make you cry your eyes out because of all the misery that happened to this one unfortunate person. Let me put it in another way when you see the label 'based on a true story', what you'll get is a typical housewife movie. Since I'm not a housewife (I'm a 26 year old male), this kind of movies doesn't appeal to me all that much. But I always like to make exceptions and Girl, Interrupted deserves better than being called mediocre.In fact it reminded me a bit of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, the ULTIMATE classic in this genre, with an outstanding Jack Nicholson. Both movies are situated in the seventies (Girl, Interrupted in the sixties and seventies) and both tell the story about a person in a mental institution. The main difference is perhaps that this time it isn't about men, but about women.Since I'm talking about One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, I will probably have to say which one of the two is the best. Well, the choice wasn't easy to make, but I still prefer OFOTCN. Why? Not because of the acting. In both movies, the acting is of a very high quality. Neither because of the directing or the script, but because of the time it was made in. OFOTCN was the first of the two to appear and shocked the entire world. It showed how these patients were treated (and sometimes still are, but that's something else). Girl Interrupted isn't that shocking anymore. We already know what it was like back than and it all has been done before, even though this is a real story (which adds a lot to the drama).However, don't think this movie isn't good. It is very good and shocking, especially when you haven't seen OFOTCN yet. Let me end by saying that this one is a very close second and that I give it an 8.5\/10 (I gave OFOTCN the full 10\/10).

When it came out, you wanted to see it. The way they advertised it, how could you not? We're all guilty of morbid curiosity and love the irony of a ship so grand in scale and deemed Unsinkable to so many could actually do the unthinkable and pretty much capsize. It fascinates all of us. James Cameron did an excellent job of pulling this together. They wasted a lot of water that some 3rd world countries could have used, but still a good job. I liked the flashback idea, but it's pretty obvious the chick woulda been dead in most real life circumstances and Kate Winslet doesn't play a convincing 17 year old girl.I liked the true ending of the ship. It actually went down in 2 pieces rather than in all one form as other versions have implied. It kinda makes this movie the definitive version in a way, because it broke the standard. The climax was for the men. To this day, all my boyfriend talks about is the guy hitting the propeller and spinning madly to his icy death. But, the love story was definitely for the women. It was a little pretentious to think that she would have followed this man in the 4 days that she knew him, but hey, that's Hollywood. Rose was a nice insert as a person in history, but it seems fairly fantastic today that this story would ever happen. Jack was a stupid twit of a man that had no prospects and we're supposed to believe that she would run away with this cat? Oooh, rich bastard who's hot or poor twit whose only appeal is that he lives under a bridge? Oh, the choices. His nomadic existence was suppose to charm us, but all I saw was a bum. And look what happened to him. He was supposed to be so used to cold water and whatnot and the boy froze like a fishstick. If I were her, I woulda went back to Cal and said, My bad about that spitting thing.I loved the character of Mr. Andrews. A little stupid for wanting to die with his creation, but to each his own. I can't believe that people actually wanted to go down with the ship and kept playing music and whatnot. Absolutely saddening that they were missing the big picture. Ship sinking. Need to get off. I found the music inspiring and we'll always have Celine Dion's song to drag us back to 1997 the year it wouldn't stop playing. I never really felt the terror of being on this ship though. I found that people had plenty of opportunities to get off, but they were just too damn stuck up to try anything. Only the 3rd class folks you felt sorry for. They actually tried to keep them on the boat. You felt bad for them, because they were the ones that were gonna die, because of their low station. However, I didn't have sympathy for first class folks. And where were the 2nd class people? It was like they didn't exist. I guess they weren't instrumental to the plot, but I wouldn't have minded seeing them at times.And of course, we're all a little mad at the old lady dropping the necklace in the water. I know it's supposed to be poignant, but give it to the granddaughter or somebody. Brock should have gotten it. I felt bad for him because he was like the rabbit from the Trix commercials. Just let him have it for goodness sakes! He's only devoted his entire adult life to it. No, little old crackpot decides to toss it overboard.

I really wonder why, because I must say that I really appreciated it. It wasn't the best movie I've seen lately, but it sure had something good to offer. I know, many people (especially fundamentalist Americans and Islamists), think that religion is something that should not be laughed with, but personally I think they are all wrong! It's our moral duty to laugh with it. You know why? Because laughter is a way of criticizing all the things that have gone wrong and still go wrong in the name of faith. Or how else would you call the crusades in the medieval times, the many terrorists shouting Allah is great when blowing someone's son or daughter up, or even a president who uses God to end all his speeches and to blow up entire cities and nations without any good reason... But enough about politics and faith. This review should be about the movie and its subject.This movie could have been really hard to swallow if it had taken it's subject (getting someone out of the hands of a bad religion or a sect) too serious, but thanks to the, sometimes subtle, humor that was used, this movie wasn't too hard. And you can't say that it left out important things either. It showed the concerned but ultra-conservative family, the 'exorcist' who will perform his magic trick and bring back the girl as a good person, but ultimately starts asking questions about his believes himself, how the girl was overwhelmed by the guru, the interesting cat and mouse game between Ruth and her 'exorcist'...The acting was very good. I really enjoyed Harvey Keitel's performance. He was exactly the way I would imagine such an 'exorcist', yet he still surprised me from time to time.

It is, in my mind, one of the hardest genres to do; the basis for most TV films on on a Thursday afternoon, so hats off to Robert Benton for the TERRIFIC script. Hoffman has never been better as Ted Kramer, and I found myself becoming deeply involved in his plight to keep his son. He rivals Pacino for acting with his eyes (in this I mean the way he uses one simple look to express everything he is feeling - for instance his look after his son tells him that he loves him), and it was just a really believable story portrayed by Hoffman in a really believable way. I feel that writers and directors these days often don't consider what is credible to the audience enough - even in science fiction, if that makes sense. I think that Dustin Hoffman, despite his numerous Oscar nominations and the two he succeeded with (this film rightly being one of those), is underrated and does not get as much praise as he deserves. But one great actor and a great script does not make the perfect movie. Think of the greatest films of all time Pulp Fiction, The Godfather, Casablanca, Schindler's List etc. - all may have great scripts, and all may have great leading actors in Travolta, Brando, Bogart and Neeson, but it is the supporting cast that truly turns a very good film into a great film. Meryl Streep is the best screen actress of all time by a country mile - and her part in this film is a significant one that makes the film what it is. Just watch the courtroom scene - MY GOD that is good acting. And once again, she is believable. She is in nearly all her films, but here this statement rings true more than ever.

So to conclude my little film review, I hope that I have influenced someone out there to have a look at this movie that won several Oscars and appreciate it in the way I have.

I remember seeing a couple of scenes from The Holy Grail on television when I was younger (the notorious 'black knight' scene and the harem of girls in the castle) and not finding it uproarious as I might have expected. Maybe I'm just not into British comedy, I thought ignorantly. Then I finally gave into it, as I got to be a big fan of Terry Gilliam's films, and discovered as well that John Cleese is one of the funniest people to ever come out of Britain. Life of Brian was surprisingly witty and fun as it dug its claws into a subject of some controversy. Then I went on to this film, and it took two times to watch the film until I found it to definitely be a truly masterful effort in the delirious.The first time some of the jokes and gags and puns and visuals flew over my head, but as an emotional experience (if one could call it that) was immediate- many of the parts were funny as hell, even if I didn't think the whole was. The second time around everything fit, I laughed harder at the jokes I laughed at before, and I was officially a fan of the movie. Like another comedy classic than came out a year previous to Holy Grail, Blazing Saddles, the whole story is rather inconsequential when it comes to the set-pieces and actors in the various roles. King Arthur and the knights see a strange, God-like figure in the sky (my biggest laugh the first time around, one of many genius illustrations from Gilliam) who tells them to find the Holy Grail. So off they go, and encounter a plethora of trials and tribulations along the way.In fact, the whole film is an act of stream-of-consciousness (as was the television show, Flying Circus) where the animated bits are instrumental in taking the shape of the story, or 'skits' in the film. My personal favorites were the 'black knight', the knights who say 'ni', the 'killer rabbit' (one of the great comedy surprises I have had recently), and the boy who just wants to...sing!. But even when a weaker bit might come along, it may be a bit that doesn't lack the fine visual detail and look provided by Gilliam and Terry Jones, or with some form of wit (i.e. I didn't find the bring out your dead scene as extraordinary, but I wouldn't doubt it's original).Although many say that Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which starts and ends with total disregard (and fitfully so) for all logical rules in storytelling, that it's one of the funniest films ever made (which it very well could be), I feel only very slightly reserved in recommending it to anyone. If you're in the mood for a bloody, moody, very low-budget dip into medieval satire by five of Britain's most talented writer\/actors (not to mention to 'token' American), it's for you. But it may prove too silly, and maybe too sporadic, to work as a whole. One thing that I can say without a doubt, however, is that it serves as an audacious move in post-modern comedy. To put it another way, Monty Python (not just this film but the TV show, movies, and albums) were a major influence on the guys who do South Park.

Maybe I'm just not into British comedy, I thought ignorantly. Then I finally gave into it, as I got to be a big fan of Terry Gilliam's films, and discovered as well that John Cleese is one of the funniest people to ever come out of Britain. Life of Brian was surprisingly witty and fun as it dug its claws into a subject of some controversy. Then I went on to this film, and it took two times to watch the film until I found it to definitely be a truly masterful effort in the delirious.The first time some of the jokes and gags and puns and visuals flew over my head, but as an emotional experience (if one could call it that) was immediate- many of the parts were funny as hell, even if I didn't think the whole was. The second time around everything fit, I laughed harder at the jokes I laughed at before, and I was officially a fan of the movie. Like another comedy classic than came out a year previous to Holy Grail, Blazing Saddles, the whole story is rather inconsequential when it comes to the set-pieces and actors in the various roles. King Arthur and the knights see a strange, God-like figure in the sky (my biggest laugh the first time around, one of many genius illustrations from Gilliam) who tells them to find the Holy Grail. So off they go, and encounter a plethora of trials and tribulations along the way.In fact, the whole film is an act of stream-of-consciousness (as was the television show, Flying Circus) where the animated bits are instrumental in taking the shape of the story, or 'skits' in the film. My personal favorites were the 'black knight', the knights who say 'ni', the 'killer rabbit' (one of the great comedy surprises I have had recently), and the boy who just wants to...sing!. But even when a weaker bit might come along, it may be a bit that doesn't lack the fine visual detail and look provided by Gilliam and Terry Jones, or with some form of wit (i.e. I didn't find the bring out your dead scene as extraordinary, but I wouldn't doubt it's original).Although many say that Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which starts and ends with total disregard (and fitfully so) for all logical rules in storytelling, that it's one of the funniest films ever made (which it very well could be), I feel only very slightly reserved in recommending it to anyone. If you're in the mood for a bloody, moody, very low-budget dip into medieval satire by five of Britain's most talented writer\/actors (not to mention to 'token' American), it's for you. But it may prove too silly, and maybe too sporadic, to work as a whole. One thing that I can say without a doubt, however, is that it serves as an audacious move in post-modern comedy. To put it another way, Monty Python (not just this film but the TV show, movies, and albums) were a major influence on the guys who do South Park.

Director Kramer managed to bring in a virtual who's who of film and TV comic personalities of the day. This doesn't mean it is always hysterical or even the funniest film ever made, but it's scope and cast and budget earn it a place in cinematic comedy history. Durante, on the lam from police, drives his car off a cliff in the desert and is attended to by a handful of drivers who witnessed the accident. His dying words tell of a fortune buried under a huge W two-hundred miles away. The folks then bicker about how to handle the money, first determining how to split it, but soon deteriorating into an every man for himself trek to the location. Countless crazy escapades ensue as the group splits up, re-teams, adds in fellow money-hungry participants and practically kill themselves (and anyone in the way!) in an all-out effort to reach the loot. Meanwhile, retiring detective Tracy monitors all from his police station, eventually joining them at the locale to give them the surprise of their lives. Berle plays a doubly hen-pecked man with a pouty wife (Provine) and a shrewy mother-in-law (Merman.) Winters is a hapless truck driver. Rooney and Hackett are dim-witted pals. Caesar and Adams are a couple on their second honeymoon. These core characters are eventually joined by stuffy Englishman Thomas, deceptive Silvers, beatnik lifeguard Shawn and a couple of bemused cab drivers. Legendary comic performers such as Keaton, The Three Stooges and others make blink and you'll miss 'em cameo appearances. As all-inclusive as the cast seems, there are some notable absences such as Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Red Skelton, Carol Burnett, Danny Kaye, to name a few. It was just a tad too early for Paul Lynde to have been included, which is a shame because he would have been a stupendous addition to the ensemble. As it is, though, the performers all get a chance to strut their stuff and do the types of comedy that made them famous. Merman is highly memorable as the loud-mouthed harpy and, happily, makes no effort whatsoever to be dignified as she's knocked around and up-ended repeatedly. Winters is very strong in a somewhat understated performance. Hackett starts off well, but loses some steam as it goes on. Adams was in the unenviable position of filming a movie about car chases just months after her husband Ernie Kovacs died in an auto accident (with Caesar playing the role meant for him!) but she does an admirable job, her curves adding an extra dose of visual appeal. The weak links include Rooney, who just isn't charismatic enough to hold the attention (nor is his character interesting or particularly likable) and Provine, who is basically a mannequin throughout. Tracy runs hot and cold and can, at times, be seen looking off set for cue cards. His relationship with the director is the only explanation for his presence here as broad comedy was not a forte of his. The film is clearly overlong, but it only occasionally feels like it with so many amusing, eye-popping, or jaw-dropping events unfolding one after another. It's certainly wonderful to have a cinematic record of all these comedy greats working together.

Her dad is a crook in the used auto business, and her mother lives in her own little world where nothing is more important than herself. Matilda goes to the most depressing school run by the most Nazi-like Principal anywhere, but has the nicest teacher anyone could want. This movie is the tale of this little girl and her teacher, and how they helped each other to achieve happiness. Not to be taken too seriously, mostly a fun comedy where we can cheer when the bad guys get what is coming to them. The filming technique uses lots of wide angle close up shots, which distorts features, especially of the bad guys.SPOILERS follow. Danny DeVito directed and narrates. His narration is nice and in stark contrast to his role as Matilda's dad, Harry Wormwood, who is clueless about how to be a dad. DeVito's real world wife, Rhea Perlman, plays Zinna Wormwood, Matlida's clueless mom. Pam Ferris bravely plays the mean, overbearing Agatha Trunchbull, Principal of the school, dressed like a Nazi teacher might have been. She has pictures of the school children on her dart board for target practice. We learn as the story develops that she was the aunt of the nice schoolteacher, 'Jenny' Honey played by Embeth Davidtz, having raised Jenny after both her mother and father died, the latter mysteriously. So Jenny remained as a teacher only because of her aunt.Matilda is smart, polite, likes to read and learn, all things foreign to her parents. In class, we see that she can multiply very large numbers in her head. At school, she is the only student who stands up to Ms, Trunchbull. Then Matilda finds that she has the power to move things by thinking about them, especially when she gets angry. She uses this near the end by having a chalk write a message on the board, to Ms Trunchbull, from 'Magnus', Jenny's father whose death we come to believe was caused by Trunchbull. The message told her to leave and never come back. Fortunately Matilda's parents are also rushing to leave, to move to Guam, and Matilda conveniently has adoption papers handy, which her parents sign so that she can become jenny's daughter.

I truly believe prior to the first installments release, the movie-going world did not know what was in store. What they got was the beginning of on of the greatest journeys ever put on screen. The Series only gets better as it progresses. I jumped at the opportunity to see Fellowship of the Ring because I greatly enjoyed fantasy tales, despite not reading the books themselves. So much emphasis was put on the special effects and scenery that many of the actors were overlooked. Wood as Frodo hardly got any credit for his role, even Liv Tyler was more recognized for her part. Ian McKellen does a superb job as one of my favorite characters; Gandolf. The Movie also saw breakout performances from Sean Astin and Orlando Bloom.Fellowship of the Ring was more artistic and contained less intense battle sequences then its two successors. Numerous people have stated that they despised this movie because of its length and slow pace. However it is this first installment that sets the pace for the excitement and the following movies. The 1st heavily focuses on character development and plot. This film does not deviate from the book at all from what i am told and is nice to see a movie that does not rely primarily on senseless violence to draw a crowd. My hat's of to Peter Jackson in creating a cinematic masterpiece of epic proportions.

This play itself is compelling and has a kind of Tennessee Williams flavor; especially The Glass Menagerie and A Streetcar Named Desire. The adaptation is very successful as the production designer (Gene Callahan) manages to transfer the book's psychologically oppressive ambiance to film; shame hangs in the air of this house like a cloud of poison gas.Director Paul Newman gets performances from his cast that pull together parallel stories of how a strong, strange, and beautiful flower can unexpectedly spring from an environmental wasteland. His most difficult task is restraining or masking Joanne Woodward's earthy likability so that we waste little sympathy on her character. But using Woodward as the mother allowed him to get a once-in-a-lifetime performance from their daughter (Nell Potts as Matilda-Tillie in the play). Potts abandoned acting after this movie but her ethereal take on Matilda is right on the money and a big reason why the film works so well.This is really just a story about Matilda's science fair project in which marigold seeds are subjected to varying amounts of gamma ray radiation (the independent variable in her experiment). Those flowers receiving a moderate amount of radiation bloom in amazing and wonderful ways. However, those flowers subjected to additional radiation either have their growth stunted or whither and die.Meanwhile Tillie and her older sister Ruth are living an analogous story with their mother Beatrice in an extremely emotionally abusive household. In the play it is stated that Beatrice is insane but not how or why she became this way. In the movie the viewer soon reaches this same conclusion. Older daughter Ruth (an amazing performance by Eli Wallach's daughter Roberta) maintains a fairly normal lifestyle at school, she is a majorette and popular but is very selfish and demanding of attention. Notably she is also an epileptic, which is subtly significant because it is analogous to receiving an excessive amount of radiation. Tillie is very different (analogous to receiving a moderate amount of radiation), seemingly shy and withdrawn, she is actually very independent and has found an outlet from the family in her science projects. This outlet serves as a protective niche in which she can bloom.A truly great scene is Matilda's acceptance speech at the science fair. She explains the results of her project and really lays out the main theme of the story for the viewer. Watch as she mentions how excessive radiation causes dwarf plants, at that point they cut to a closeup of Ruth in the audience. Both the experiment and the family illustrate that while a reasonable degree of adversity can actually be beneficial, too much of the same adversity will poison life. While this would be a good film if focused solely on Matilda, it is elevated to extraordinary because Newman chooses to also make Ruth a central part of the story. The conventional movie-way to tell this story would be to make it an inspirational tale of triumphing over adversity; of free-will overcoming destiny. But fortunately Newman elects to show both sides of the story, in Ruth he shows someone who never has a chance, who cannot recognize her destiny or ever hope to overcome it.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

I thought wrong. As a matter of fact I think this film was just a tab above average, and definitely not as good as the two other films mentioned above. My main beef with Rear Window is that there was simply not enough condemning evidence before the dog got killed to suspect a man of possibly committing murder.First of all, I didn't think it's too out of ordinary for a jewelry dealer to go out at night. He might be doing business with someone only available at night, and he might have forgotten to bring a few things that the buyer wanted so he came back a couple of times. Maybe he had a argument with his wife and went out a couple of times to clear his mind because he couldn't sleep. Maybe he was smuggling drugs this one time or some other illegal merchandise, and as bad as this is that's still not murder! The possibilities are simply endless.Second of all, I have knives and saws in my house, and if I'm moving I'd certainly pack everything. Does that make me a murderer if a neighbor should see me packing these things? I wouldn't write this if I am. I think it's quite ridiculous to suspect the husband of CUTTING UP HIS WIFE'S CORPSE simply because he was packing up his knives and saws for relocation.I have a problem with the purse as well. How in heck did Jeff and Lisa come to the conclusion that the purse they saw was the wife's favorite? My mom's got more than one purse, and she never takes all of them wherever she goes. And how are they so sure that the ring was the wife's wedding band? I bet neither of them had met the wife in person let alone taking notice of her ring.Lastly, if I was the neighbor, I would laugh off Jeff's accusation, and tell him to get a real hobby 'cause he's got nothing on me. Instead the neighbor freaks out even though he was cool as a cucumber while disposing of his wife's remains.With all this said, I think the overall plot really fall apart due to these holes. But I did like the concept of Rear Windows. I thought it was really clever how Jeff used his photos to conclude that the flower bed was disturbed, and I enjoyed the suspense when the two women went sleuthing while Jeff watched for the neighbor.

Not only that, but Titanic's present condition has become a widely known popular science topic. Everyone and their dog knows, more or less accurately, what happened that fateful night in 1912, and exactly how badly the oceans have treated the rusting piece of history since then.So, the movie is *extremely* hard to watch these days. Everyone *knows* Titanic can't be raised. Everyone *knows* the wreck looks different in real life. So there's immediately a huge barrier of believability.This movie's bad thing is that it relies *a lot* on the sense of wonder as the ship gets raised from the depths. It does the raising-the-Titanic very amazingly and interestingly. It's very easy to imagine the people in 1980 get very amazed indeed. But now... everyone will just think the whole thing looks very, very, very *wrong*.With that amazement gone, there's little else to hold the interest up. There's Cold War plotting. Accidents. Espionage. Human relations drama. But none are done nowhere near as interestingly as the ship-raising thing. I'm a big fan of special effects movies in general, and this thing was extremely state-of-the-art for 1980, so I just can't let this go past without at least 8\/10......I sure hope the book is better.So my best advice is this Just try, with all your might, forget everything you have ever learned of Titanic, except that it kind of sunk.
