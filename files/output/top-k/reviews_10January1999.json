The movie is as gory as a Paul Verhoeven film (Robocop\/Starship Troopers), but lacks the detail.  There is not much action, which is the worst part of the movie, considering the plot was dull. The movie led me in too many different directions, and made it hard for me to concentrate.  The start of the movie is interesting, and the scene where everybody attempts to evacuate is bloody as hell, but very fun to watch. The rest of the survivors consist of Ripley, the crew, and one scientist, which I got no emotional effect from, not even ripley.  I think this is where Alien, Aliens, and Alien 3 succeeded most in, the attachment to the characters.  Not having this feature made Alien Resurrection much worse then could have been.  There were some good scenes though, the evacuation at the start, and the water scene (although I find it hard to believe they could stay under the water that long).  Weaver does a good job playing her part, although it is a bad part, and Ryder just does a horrible job of whatever she was supposed to do.  The one thing that made this movie above bad to me was that it made me think.  The movie was a mess, but there were 2 scenes that made me break down emotionally, and I wasn't sure why.  Although the queen giving birth was indeed disgusting, I found it very sad when the baby killed the queen, do not ask me why, I just did.  Then, after the baby makes a few killings, comes the scene where Ripley interacts with the alien\/human baby, almost like a mother and child.  This got me thinking, and then all of a sudden she burns the window and has the baby get sucked out of the window. It made sense, but I did not want it to happen.  If she would have blown up the baby, it would have been fine.  But she has to make it go through more pain then anybody can imagine.  As it moaned loud whimpering sounds while getting piece by piece ripped off of its body, I could almost feel its pain. Topping that off it then continuously shows Ripley looking at the poor thing, almost crying.  I couldn't take it, I don't know why but for me it was one of the saddest scenes I have seen.  This scene was horrible, but it made me think differently about the film, and made me put it in the average category.  Other then those few points the rest of the movie just consisted of smart ass one liners and poor special effects (compared to starship troopers\/godzilla).

The scene that he shares with another legend of the silent film era, Buster Keaton, is truly amazing and is one of the best comedy sketches that I have ever seen. Chaplin's endless energy and spark come to life in this film and it is these elements which really push the film from a great film into something of a higher level.The story of Chaplin as an ageing Vaudvillian star is almost autobiographical. His character, Calvero, saves a young ballerina from suicide, raises her back into shape and motivates her enough to get her performing again. Along the way, she falls in love with him although he will have no part of it. Eventually they go their separate ways only to be reunited before a benefit show is held in his name. All events after I won't reveal but have to say are cinematic gold.The first hour of the film is overlong and could have probably been shortened to about an hour, however, there are really no other downfalls during the remainder of the story. The story itself is delightful, acting is superb and Chaplin plays his character as lively as he ever did in any of his silent films. Claire Bloom must be mentioned for her tremendous performance as the aspiring ballerina that falls for Calvero even though a younger and more handsome man is courting her (Chaplin's real life son Sydney). The sombre ending adds the perfect finishing touch to the film as he so often does in his other classics.I would recommend this film to anyone who would like to see the greatness of Chaplin and for anyone who would like to see two of the greatest screen legends on the screen at the same time for the only time ever.8\/10 stars.
