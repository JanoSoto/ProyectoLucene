Hang on.I saw The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 Secret of the Ooze when I was, oh, say, eight years old, and I absolutely loved it. A lot more than the first one. And now as a somewhat older individual I am afraid to return to the film. I fear I won't enjoy it as much as I originally did - because Lord knows I barely liked Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at all the second\/third\/fourth time(s) around.It's extremely poor filmmaking at its best (or worst), and fails to deliver any type of greatness such as Batman or Spider-Man did to their long-awaiting fans. In fact, there wasn't time for the fans of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to wait--they slopped up a film as soon as they could after the toys sold like Pokemon cards did three years ago come Christmas.The first film was a complete merchandising scam to cash-in on the kid-friendly franchise; this one even more so, seeing it took them only but a year to cough up another technically poor film.The plot? Ha! Well, I guess it does have one The Pizza-Chomping Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles discover a secret ooze that transformed them into what they are (hence the oh-so-clever title of the film). I don't recall there being much of a plot other than that - they just have to protect or find the ooze, I really can't remember. If this were a more important film I'd take the time to look up and find the plot outline but let's be honest Who cares?People who liked the first will love this one. On a level of filmmaking it stands as one of the worst ever--inept directing, amateurish acting, and horrible scriptwriting--but in terms of cheesiness (perhaps literally) and affection it rates strongly. I just got off giving the first Turtles movie a 2.5\/5 because I revisited it not too long ago and found it unbearably pathetic and boring, while yet at the same time strangely intriguing; it evokes nostalgia of childhood. I still remember owning all the little toy turtles--men show off cars and boys show off dolls. They're both toys, so to speak.But I still find the first film a tad bit too boring and cheesy. I was scrolling through the IMDb entry for The Secret of the Ooze earlier today. It has an average user rating of 4.4 out of 10 stars. With all my heart I can honestly say it deserves it, if not less. But I went through the message boards and came across posts by people 18 years old and over who say that they used to play with the toys in their bathtubs and absolutely loved the series as kids, and even still do simply for the nostalgia and not really the technical achievement. Any film that has Vanilla Ice come on stage towards the end and start singing a song about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (which results in 80s\/early 90s-style dancing including head-spinning) is destined to have some sort of fond familiarity years from now. It's an embarrassment for all the kids who loved watching it ten years ago; when they show it to their kids years from now it will be like when your parents used to show you photos and videos of their era which embarrassed you more than them--it's kind of scary to think that someday you will show this to your kids, and you'll be so senile by then the embarrassment you experienced looking back at it in your twenties will have completely vanquished.And so it brought back memories for me, too, and I realized that grading this film ten years ago as a film critic I would have given it what it deserves--a 0-star rating--but now, ten years after its release, I recognize it as a nostalgia-trigger; it is the element connected to the nostalgia; it channels it and unleashes the memories. To rate this film based solely upon its technical achievements, merits and accomplishments as a film would be tragic. The Secret of the Ooze is lucky--if this film didn't give old memories back to me I'd slap it with a 0 faster than you can scream Incoming 0! And while I freely admit that ten years ago it was created merely to gleam money from children, nowadays those very children who were ripped off realize they were and still love the series for what it is and what it does for them--restoring old memories. This movie is all about memories and nostalgia. If humans had no feelings this would never have made it to DVD.I have no idea how to go about rating this film. I liked it as a kid, sure, but now? I reflect upon it with a sense of being cheated by the film studios--and I don't like that. But then I remembered that I never particularly liked the original very much when I was younger, and I did like this one when I was younger, so perhaps I still would enjoy it for what it is A celebration of mediocrity, greedy business executives and big green turtles!Cowabunga, dudes!(I hesitate 5\/5 stars on a scale of nostalgia. 0\/5 on a scale of technical achievement.)

I have watched it again, for each of the past two days, and come away with a much deeper appreciation... even passion for it.I found I was able to grasp so many more of the expressions and bits of dialogue which I had missed in previous viewings. My personal recommendation is to watch this movie more than once. The first may capture you with its story and the passion which flows through it but there is so much blatantly visual material that you can't absorb the rest.I can see how some of the other reviewers could form their opinion that this was soft porn, as there is plenty of simple nakedness and scenes of people loving. However, to me, Baines' disregard for clothing simply goes along with his blunt honesty. Why hide what you are feeling or thinking? When you see him bathing and washing his clothes in the river with his Maori(an?) friends, his nakedness and that of the others does not seem pornographic, just practical and comfortable. It makes the uptight civilized folks seem even more pathetic. Sometimes, clothes just get in the way.During subsequent viewings pay special attention to the facial expressions, especially of Ada while she plays her piano. When you do, you sense a bit of what Baines (Harvey Keitel) is stirred by. Unable to speak, Ada plays her piano, and it is as if she doesn't miss the ability to speak with her mouth, as the music she can produce with her fingers is so much more beautiful than spoken words. It wasn't until my second viewing that I caught that Ada was able to speak with her mind to her former lover, like laying music on a sheet. At first I thought she was just telling a fantasy or sugar-coated story to her young daughter, the product of that particular relationship. Towards the end of the movie, however, when her situation seems so hopeless, she allows herself to communicate with her husband the truth of her need and sadness. It took something so shocking to break him out of the morbid path he was bent on following, and it works, much to the relief of the characters and the viewers.Perhaps one of the ideas I was struck by is the recurrence of being slapped in the face by the reality that one's ability to speak (Ada), or read (Baines), or see (the piano tuner) does not always limit one from finding ways to express and fully enjoy passion and joy. Sometimes, it seems, a person can allow that disability to send them more fully in other directions, perhaps finding their way less distracted because they focus so much more on the senses or abilities they still have. Sometimes I have caught myself recognizing that my life might be so much simpler if I was only really interested in one or two things instead of the myriad fascinations that strike me and take me down different paths.Baines has found his place in New Zealand, with the Maori people instead of in Europe with his wife. He is surrounded by their love and respect and you can't help but notice the happiness they find in their simple ways. The blunt honesty in their speech seems to match that of Baines. This contrasts greatly with the stilted Victorian mannerisms of Ada's husband and other European settlers there.  Ada doesn't fit in with them and likely never did even while in Europe. At first you think that is because of her muteness, but then you see her fire and forthright spirit shining in her daughter Flora. It becomes obvious that their honesty and beauty will just wilt away if they stay in the oppressive civilized world.The ending, with Flora contentedly cartwheeling across the grass and Ada playing her piano and sharing a tremendous love with Baines, was beautiful. I smile just thinking about it and look forward to owning the DVD.

I didn't like his style, I didn't like his mannerisms, and well, there was nothing at all I could think of that I liked about him whatsoever.  I don't hang around a well-watched crowd so I haven't heard first-hand about his comic originality.  However, I am unable to say anything negative about him now because I've seen this flick and I am extremely impressed.  The aspect of this film that impresses me the most is the way the characters are portrayed and the way we see them change.  I wouldn't say the plot takes the back seat, but discovering more about Annie's personality and the way she comes together as a character is done flawlessly.  I like that Woody has no fear of confusing his audience with his changes in perspective.  I see this movie and I know it's hard for others not to make their own movies similarity-free to this one, as small as they may be.  I don't know the specifics on the originality of his methods or what was already considered conventional in comedy films in his day, but it is easy to see that his style is definitely his own, and it is funny. I want to type in some specific events from the film that I find remarkable, but I don't want to ruin the experience for you.  I just suggest watch it if you haven't already.  Why not, watch it again if you have seen it.  I don't even want to like Woody, but when you get down to it he's downright hilarious, and this movie is undeniable proof.

The sure touch and tight control of script, action and editing he showed in The Wild Bunch (easily his best film, one of the ten best films ever in fact; don't believe anyone who tells you otherwise) are not consistent here, but individual sequences, such as the initial attack on the machine gun bunker, are vintage Sam.What makes this film great is the savagery of its bleak, existential anti-war sentiments. By showing the battle at the Russian front from the perspective of the enemy, ie Steiner's German platoon, Cross of Iron avoids patriotic cliché and forces us to confront deep-seated prejudices. By the time they are slaughtered at the climax, we do genuinely care about Steiner's men, to the extent that we exult in Steiner's clinical execution of the agent of their murders. The real punch comes right at the very end of the film, during the last part of the end credits a succession of slides depicting wartime atrocities, including the hanging of children in concentration camps, is projected onto the screen, the sound of the projector mimicking that of a gun being loaded.

For just over two years, I have suffered through the highs and lows of &#145;depression'. So it was with great anticipation that I watched the new Russell Crowe movie &#145;A Beautiful Mind'. Sure it has the Hollywood feel to it, but it is a film that I feel we can all learn from, and realise that any illness, even mental illness, can be overcome, if you really want too.John Nash, a student at Princeton, struggles to think of an original idea that will make him matter to the world. Nash is eccentric, socially awkward, and extremely competitive. Eventually, he finds the inspiration for his innovative and influential work on game theory. He's chosen for a post at MIT, which includes crucial code-breaking work for the US government. There, he meets a beautiful and brilliant student, Alicia. They marry but their happiness is threatened, as Nash, belatedly diagnosed as schizophrenic, descends into madness.Director of &#145;ABM' is the very skilled and successful Ron Howard. In this movie he shows just why he is a big Hollywood director toady. I liked how Howard shows Nash's debilitating illness, the timeline of the film, which was different to other movies, showing a similar story and how we meet certain unique characters. Howard was helped out with this film, by best friend and producer Brian Grazer. He placed his fine touches to the film, making it an even better experience to watch. The story for ABM was taken from the novel (of the same name) by Sylvia Nasar. The story for the screen was written by Akiva Goldsman. Although its content has been hotly debated by many people, saying that it might not be as legitimate as the movie actually shows. It is my feeling that this story was cleverly devised by Goldsman, especially the make-believe characters that Nash interacts with, when he becomes extremely ill. This would have been a difficult story to get &#145;right', but I think that Goldsman got it spot on. The main role in ABM was that of mathematician mastermind, John Nash (Russell Crowe). This role was quite different than the other roles that Crowe has taken on in the past. In ABM, he is a nervous, weird and mentally ill individual. Crowe's general onscreen demeanor is that of &#145;arrogance'. When we first see Crowe he is immediately into character, which gives his performance an even greater impact. This role would have been an extremely demanding one for Crowe, to become not only this brilliant mind, but to show the frightening side to &#145;Schizophrenia' and what patience of such an illness has to go through. Crowe also has to be commended for the way he interacts with all the imaginary characters of the film, as it is in his acting that you believe they might be real. This role in ABM shows just why Crowe is a successful Hollywood actor today. But just as good as Crowe in ABM is the character of Alicia Nash (Jennifer Connelly). Her role gave the movie its main emotional avenue, with her love, faithfulness and vulnerability very impacting from where I viewed the movie. Another &#145;real' character I liked was Martin Henson (Josh Lucas). The confrontation he has with Nash at the start of the film is very interesting to see. However, Henson's compassion and friendship shown to Nash towards the end of the film is very touching.     I am also a big fan of the roles taken on by the actors, who were imaginary characters in ABM. The three people in question are William Parcher (Ed Harris), Charles Herman (Paul Bettany) and Marcee Herman (played very well by the cute Vivian Cardone). Every scene with any and all these performers is terrific to watch, and the movie shows them very well. My favourite scenes are when Nash believes his wife might be killed by Parcher and when Nash is in Henson's school office, trying very hard to ignore Charles. The way the movie shows both of these scenes, both being funny and dramatic, is the very reason I like it so much.                There are other people behind the scenes that need to be highlighted for their work on the movie. The make-up department did a wonderful job in turning many of these young actors into the older people they are at the end of the film. The work done on both Crowe and Connelly was quite remarkable. The music to ABM was well composed by &#145;Titanic's' James Horner. The music makes the movie much more dramatic and emotional. In fact at one stage, I felt I was watching the &#145;Titanic' all over again. John Nash is a brilliant man, showing that his mathematical skills are very invaluable for the world we live in. Nash is also a very complicated man as his mathematical discoveries are very complex. Although &#145;A Beautiful Mind' did win 4 Academy Awards, including best picture and director, I feel it should have won more, including Crowe's performance, which deserved a Best Actor Oscar. People have been quick to praise or criticise the way the movie showed the treatments in combating mental illnesses like Schizophrenia. I think we need to learn more about mental illness, and this movie goes some small to doing that. Having been affected by mental illness in my life, I really do have a soft spot for a film like this.

Most people still don't realize just HOW controversial this film was when it was made. The MPAA wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. McNaughton fought for 4 years to get an R rating, but no dice. And since he didn't want the X, and there was no NC-17 rating at the time, it was finally released, with no rating, in 1990. And why? I've seen films with MORE violence in them...Romero's Day of the Dead leaps to mind. But it's not the violence in this film that makes it so disturbing. It's the way the material is handled. And this is what the film's detractors obviously can't appreciate.Henry doesn't bother with any type of morality...it neither glorifies nor denounces Henry's actions. It simply observes. It places those actions before us and says there it is...you deal with it...you sort it out. People who don't like this film often say that there's no character development...no discernible plot line...etc., etc. Those people should stop throwing around film school terms. This is one movie that doesn't present events in a movie reality...it shows us things as they are in the real world. Character development means showing you enough of the characters in 90-120 minutes to make you feel as if you've known them forever. How often do you spend 90 minutes with a real person and know that much about them...or feel that you can seriously identify with them? It's just a conceit of film-making. Same with plot lines. Does life have a plot line? Not at all. Life is an endless succession of things happening. Some seem important and\/or entertaining...some don't. Henry, in its attempt to realistically portray the life of a serial killer, does not need a plot line...in fact, it benefits from having only a very loose plot line. Much like a homicidal version of The Catcher in the Rye, this film seems much like a lot of things that happened, as opposed to a carefully constructed fictitious story...which make it seems all the more real...and all the more disturbing.Henry is disturbing on many levels. Firstly, it feels very real. Too real, perhaps. Nothing is slicked up...nothing seems counterfeit or contrived. The entire thing is so utterly plausible that it chills you to the bone. Secondly, the complete lack of police involvement is equally disturbing. The only time you see a police car in this film, it's driving past in the background as Henry is cruising the streets. It drives past...and that's it. And Henry isn't scared...nor is he even aware, apparently. He has nothing to hide. He knows the police won't connect his crimes to one another...and they certainly won't connect them to him. So what has he to fear?And finally, the setting of Chicago makes the film more disturbing for me, as I'm somewhat familiar with that city and can spot some locales in the film that I recognize. In fact, a friend of mine who lives in Chicago told me that the first time he watched Henry, he and a friend rented it and sat down in his friend's apartment to watch it. It was about halfway through that they realized that the apartment they were sitting in was the same one used as Henry's apartment in the film. All I can say is...I'd never use that bath tub again.All in all, I truly wish that more directors had the guts to make films like Henry. Honestly, I can't think of one film that's comparable. There simply aren't any films out there that are anything like this. This is truly one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. After seeing Happiness, I guess that Henry probably got knocked down to Number Two on that list. But Second Most Disturbing Film Of All-Time is still a damn fine achievement, in my opinion.If you want to see an accurate and appallingly realistic portrayal of what the life of a serial killer must be like, definitely give Henry a viewing. Make up your own mind from there.Oh, and a final note...one reviewer stated concretely that his biggest problem with the film was that serial killers work alone. This is, of course, not always the case. The real life counterparts to Henry and Otis (Henry Lee Lucas and Ottis Toole) DID kill together, as did Bianchi and Buono, the infamous Hillside Stranglers. Those are not the only such instances...but they're certainly the best-known. Therefore, the overly broad generalization that serial killers work alone is no real attack on the realism of this film.

But that series has to thank for its success, to the 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' movie, made back in 1992. It has a completely different feel to what the TV series has had, but I think I liked the movie much more. Being both a good comedy and teen movie, this is a film that any young person can enjoy.Blonde, bouncy Buffy is your typical high school cheerleader - her goal is to 'marry Christian Slater and die' and nothing gets in her way when it is time to shop. But all that changes when a strange man Merrick informs her that she has been chosen by fate to kill vampires. With the help of a romantic rebel Pike, Buffy is soon spending school nights protecting L.A. from Lathos, the Vampire King, his side-kick, Amilyn (Lefty) and their determined gang of bloodsuckers. It is everything you would expect from a teen queen in the valley.Being a teen movie, Buffy is a wonderfully written character for the screen, as was this movie's story that was highly entertaining, and at times very funny. The story was written by Joss Wheldon, who certainly made this film seem very 'vampirish'. What was also very clever in this story was the way that Wheldon allowed this film's story not to be too so serious, because that was the other reason I like the film so much. I also believe that Wheldon would have used many teen movie stories to mould the sort of characters that Buffy comes into contact with.Another great achievement of this film was who was directing it, that being Fran Rubel Kuzui. Having heard from her on the failures\/successes of the film, I think she was a good choice as the director of the film. She mentioned that releasing the film at the time of the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992, was one of the movies big mistakes, which she believed, was as much her fault as anyone involved in the making of the film. I love the way that Fran brought Buffy out as very feminine sort of character for part of the film, but then allowed us to see that she was a different, more fearless kind of girl. It was also Fran's good work that made this film seem not so serious as well.Buffy (Kristy Swanson) was a great choice as the lead character of the movie. Kristy was able to change her character traits very quickly, from one of a very ditzy character, like her friends Jennifer (Michele Abrams), Kimberly (Hilary Swank) and Nicole (Paris Vaughan), to a girl that was told she was the 'chosen one'. From my resources, I learned that Swanson 'trained to blend in martial arts with gymnastics and cheerleading skills, a unique combination that helped give Buffy's vampire slaying a-one-of-a-kind style'. Her dedication to this role made it all the more special from where I viewed it.The other main roles of the film include Merrick (Donald Sutherland) who was a very dark and intelligent role. He shows Buffy that she is that one person that can help save her home-town from the invasion of vampires. Also helping in the battle against these blood-sucking monsters, is Pike (90210's Luke Perry). This role from Perry was his film debut, an amicable performance from him. I really liked the way that both Buffy and Pike suited each other, as you wanted them to get together.The vampires in this film, while not being really gory like other vampire movies I have seen, they were still great value and very effective in the make-up of this film's story. The major vampire roles include Lathos, the Vampire King (Rutger Hauer), Amilyn 'Lefty' (played very well by comedy actor Paul 'Pee-Wee Herman' Reubens), Benny (David Arquette) and Grueller (Sasha Jenson). In fact there was an amusing scene involving Grueller in a basketball match, who at one stage is up against an opponent, namely Hollywood star, a very young Ben Affleck.This movie, while showing vampires in a very different kind of light, did a great job in making them look like vampires should. The movie also made Buffy look extremely attractive and vibrant. This aspect of the movie was taken on by costume designer Marie France. It was funny when we see all of Buffy's weapons like her spears, crucifix and deodorant spray. It was very funny when Buffy says that her 'PMS' is a big weapon in fighting Vampires.Although you can read quotes about this movie, like this one - 'Despite Swanson's engaging, exuberant performance, the film failed to perform at the box office, or to fix its young star in the public imagination', I am one person who really liked it and cannot understand why that was the case. The main reason I wanted to re-watch this film and even review it, was because I saw a TV special that was looking back on why this movie failed at the box office, but continues to succeed on the video store shelves today. It made me want to remember why I liked this movie as much as I did and still do. It is my opinion, that it was a great shame that this film did not succeed more than it has, because I think many people the world over did themselves a disservice by not seeing this film. I am just glad that I was not one of those people.CMRS gives 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer - The movie' 4 (Very Good Film)  ","genre":null},{"date":"8 October 2003","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  I have not been a big fan of the 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' TV series, for reasons that I am not sure why.

I really liked the way that both Buffy and Pike suited each other, as you wanted them to get together.The vampires in this film, while not being really gory like other vampire movies I have seen, they were still great value and very effective in the make-up of this film's story. The major vampire roles include Lathos, the Vampire King (Rutger Hauer), Amilyn 'Lefty' (played very well by comedy actor Paul 'Pee-Wee Herman' Reubens), Benny (David Arquette) and Grueller (Sasha Jenson). In fact there was an amusing scene involving Grueller in a basketball match, who at one stage is up against an opponent, namely Hollywood star, a very young Ben Affleck.This movie, while showing vampires in a very different kind of light, did a great job in making them look like vampires should. The movie also made Buffy look extremely attractive and vibrant. This aspect of the movie was taken on by costume designer Marie France. It was funny when we see all of Buffy's weapons like her spears, crucifix and deodorant spray. It was very funny when Buffy says that her 'PMS' is a big weapon in fighting Vampires.Although you can read quotes about this movie, like this one - 'Despite Swanson's engaging, exuberant performance, the film failed to perform at the box office, or to fix its young star in the public imagination', I am one person who really liked it and cannot understand why that was the case. The main reason I wanted to re-watch this film and even review it, was because I saw a TV special that was looking back on why this movie failed at the box office, but continues to succeed on the video store shelves today. It made me want to remember why I liked this movie as much as I did and still do. It is my opinion, that it was a great shame that this film did not succeed more than it has, because I think many people the world over did themselves a disservice by not seeing this film. I am just glad that I was not one of those people.CMRS gives 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer - The movie' 4 (Very Good Film)  ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"8 October 2003","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  This was a good movie that was well acted by both leads.

I'm not a gangsta but to this still is one of the best films today.

He has a partner with him the whole way named Manny the two starts out as low level gangsters and become the tow biggest drug kingpins in the world.

And this film shows both sides not like others who only focus on the bad this film put just as much emphasis on the good side to doing wrong as the bad side. So we have your basic rag to riches story with one catch. Montana is a man so firmly in his principles that he won't let anyone compromise them. We see this from the beginning till the bitter end.

So I decided to watch &#145;A Nightmare on Elm Street' (1984) and &#145;Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare' (1991). The first Nightmare movie was a pass, being well directed and a very original, scary movie. However, &#145;The Final Nightmare' goes down as one of the worst films I have ever seen, with Freddy being a character more a joke, then scary. So I wanted to finish this Freddy fetish, with a film I have seen many times in the trailer, that being &#145;Wes Craven's NEW NIGHTMARE'. It has looked very interesting to me, and sure enough it did not disappoint.  Are our movies no longer safe? Following the sixth and final instalment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series, the evil entity that took the shape of Freddy Krueger is released into the physical world, prompting actress Heather Langenkamp, director Wes Craven and New Line Cinema founder Bob Shaye to perform the heroics necessary to keep Freddy from becoming real in this self-referential thriller. Firstly, Wes Craven needs a big pat on the back for the effort he put into making this movie. The script that he wrote for this movie was not only fresh, but scary and exciting as well. I like the way that he makes this a &#145;horror movie within a horror movie', but also a very thrilling movie as well. This script is also very funny for all the right reasons, because when you get the jokes they are very humorous indeed. I do not want to give much away about the story, just to say that I like the way we see the movie play out, especially how Craven blends in various sequence from the original &#145;ANOES' movie, and how the plot of this movie seems to be going around itself in circles. Finally on the script, I loved how certain people played themselves. These two aspects were very satisfying for me.Then look at how Wes Craven directed the film. He placed many scary elements in the film, at just the right moment. This man put a lot of time and effort into how he wanted the film to look and feel, because when there was a scary moment, it was truly scary. Another aspect I liked about Craven's direction was the way he got great performances from his cast. If he did not get the cast right, the whole picture would have been a big failure. Lucky, Craven got the right people and directed them very well.The cast of the film is lead by actress Heather Langenkamp, who you will remember played Nancy in the first Freddy film. In this movie we see her as a happily married actress, to movie special effects man, Chase Porter (David Newsom). His demise is very interesting to see, which of course totally freaks our much older, but even sexier, hero. Heather in the film has a young son, Dylan (Miko Hughes), who at first seems like a threat to his mother. But you learn quite quickly that what is controlling Dylan is the very movie character that haunted his mother in a fictional sense, ten years ago. I like what Miko brings to the film, as it is a very fine performance from such a young kid. Then there are sections in this film where more former co-stars from &#145;ANOES' start to appear. For some of the movie we see John Saxon play himself, a friend to Heather. Then in another moment we get him back reprising the role of &#145;Nancy's dad', which was fascinating to see. Langenkamp plays this scene out with true class. Back as Freddy (and himself), is acting veteran Robert Englund. At no stage was I ever comfortable with Englund, because you just know that he would pop up again as Freddy. Freddy in this film, is back as this horrible, scary looking character, one that you would not like to meet. Add the small little cameo role from Wes Craven himself, and you have yourself a fine cast. There are some truly great moments in this film. The early scenes where we see Freddy strutting his stuff is very much like old times, with the film giving him his evil nature back. Then there are the scenes like when Heather's friend is confronted by Freddy, reminiscent of &#145;ANOES', while the sequence where we see little Dylan wondering across an 8 lane freeway is exhilarating, with Freddy being very powerful. That scene and Freddy's lair were very impressive special effects led by William Mesa and the team from &#145;The Fugitive'.I would have said I was not the biggest fan of &#145;Freddy Kruger', but after experiencing a film such as this, I must admit I am warming to the man with sword fingers. I just hope the latest Freddy film (Freddy Vs Jason X) is ok because I do wanna see it. Considering this film is ten years after Langenkamp's role in &#145;ANOES', it is a wonderful role, that she does with charm, wit and an edge, that only adds to the movie. The only thing is that I am a little jealous of Freddy, as he was under Heather's bed sheets, a place I would not mind to be. What a genius Wes Craven really is, for giving us a very refreshing film, which showed the disturbing aspects of what goes into making a horror film, which for me is totally fascinating. This film will make you ask many questions, because I know I certainly was, with some unanswerable. Our dreams were shown not to be safe many years ago, now it seems our movies are in the same predicament. Thankfully I am still game to flick on any movie. Are you?

There have been many war movies made by Hollywood, but none are quite like this.Nominated for 8 academy awards, Apocalypse Now tracks the journey of  Captain Willard, a US Army intelligence officer sent on a hazardous mission up river in Cambodia to terminate &#145;with extreme prejudice' an American renegade, a colonel named &#145;Kurtz' who has spun out of control (and out of his mind!), in a remote jungle compound. Apocalypse Now was really well made by Francis Ford Coppola (as director, producer and screenwriter). Coppola had many moments in the film where he wanted to say something and that is what he did. I love the way he shot the war scenes in this film, as they were not only very dramatic, but also very funny as well. I am certain that he was trying to deliberately show the &#145;irony of war', a real highlight of the film. Helping Coppola write the film's screenplay were Michael Herr and John Millus. They all did a fantastic job, incorporating the mind-boggling story of &#145;Hearts of Darkness', by adventurer Joseph Conrad. It is my view that this story, while being hard story to understand, is important for people to learn about. All the writers did with this story was replace the trip up the Congo Marlow has in the &#145;HOD' story, with the river trip thorough Cambodia for Captain Willard and his crew. Some people could criticise this movie's story, saying that Coppola used it for his own convenience. However I think it is good to try and learn about an old story, in a modern kind of way, in a story that has undoubtedly affected our world, for many years now.     This movie shows many characters that have gone mad (or indeed are about too end up that way!). Its main star is Willard (Martin Sheen), the captain that is given the unenviable task of trying to find the ex-army colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). While Sheen was good in certain parts of his role, I must say that I found Willard to be a very mysterious character that lacked in dialogue. For me, this made him very hard to like. A lot has been said about the small role taken on by legendary actor Marlon Brando. He might have been paid one million dollars for the performance, but he does show he was the right person for the job. I believe Brando comes across perfectly as this army colonel, gone insane. When Brando says &#145;The horror, the horror', it brought back some fond memories of the &#145;HOD' story for me. It is also funny to see the Photojournalist (Dennis Hopper), who is a really strange guy, harassing Willard when he finally finds Kurtz at his jungle hideaway. This character is another man that could be considered &#145;crazy', as all his actions signal that to me.The other cast members in the film take a lot less of the limelight in the film, as that is how the story wants them to be. But they still do have an impact at certain times of the movie. At the beginning of the film we meet a few officials that give Willard his mission. One of them is a Colonel (a very young Harrison Ford). Then on the boat that is helping take Willard on his mission through the Cambodian river are Chef (Frederic Forrest), Chief (Albert Hall), the boat driver, Lance (Sam Bottoms) who has a disturbing death scenes, and Clean (an almost unrecognisable Laurence Fishburne), whose death is much more dignified than that of the chief. When we see the war zone in Vietnam for the first time, we meet a most unusual personality, Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall). The scene with the Kilgore in it at the earlier stage of the movie, is truly great, as we see the war going on around him (with no shirt on mind you), but what is even more amazing is that he tells his officers around him, &#145;it is ok to surf, get out there or fight'. Now in any normal war film, that would be the last thing on anyone's mind, let alone an order from a top ranking official.However, the most disturbing scene in the film happens when the navy boat crew stops, suspicious about the occupants of a Vietnamese boat. The massacre that follows is very hard to watch, but it does show what can happen, when men are trained to fight and kill in war. Willard as Captain shows absolutely no compassion to these people at all.I am not worried if there are people out there that hate this movie, but I hope you at least gave it a chance before feeling that way. I hope that in some way my review has given you an insight into what the film is about. I must reiterate that this film has an historical story attached to it. If you are a fan of literature, I can only recommend you read the &#145;Hearts of darkness' story, but be ready for heavy bit of reading. If this movie gets a bit heavy for you, keep reminding yourself what it is trying to show - &#145;Captain Willard and his mission, which is to find this brilliant army colonel that has gone completely mad and kill him.

Night Shyamalan's &#145;Signs', is a brilliantly crafted movie, showing just why he is a successful director in Hollywood today. All of Shyamalan's movies have evoked a lot of discussion as to whether they are good or bad for the public that see them, with that decision up for you to decide. In this great thriller of 2002, something is not quite right in the world, signs that something might change our world for ever. Aliens have always been in our thoughts for many years now, but do they really exist?The Hess family live in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. One morning they wake to find a 500 foot crop circle in their backyard. Graham Hess and his family are told extra-terrestrials are responsible for the sign in their field. They watch, with growing dread, at the news of crop circles being found all over the world. Signs is the emotional story of one family on one farm as they encounter the terrifying last moments of life as the world is being invaded. Get ready for a close encounter of the scared kind...What do you immediately think of when you hear such phrases as &#145;crop circles', &#145;little green men' or &#145;beings from another planet'?. All of these could be construed as &#145;signs' that something is out there. That was the feeling I got from watching this film. &#145;Signs' was written, produced and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who is brilliant at making one new movie experience after another. He puts all the pieces together quite deliberately, but so carefully at the same time, that I feel it is difficult not appreciate each movie experience we get with him. The film's story has many elements that make it great. Its emotion is so clear that you have to be affected by it, as does the tension, which is as thrilling as I have seen in a movie in a long time. The other clever tools used in this movie, include the way Shyamalan shows us these scary looking aliens, with the confrontations between Graham and the alien at the vet's house and between Merrill and the alien in the Hess living room, unforgettable to say the least. Furthermore, the use of news broadcasts is another clever device, which gives the movie even more tension, especially the broadcast showing a sighting at a children's birthday party. Shyamalan also created some great characters for the movie. Sure, there might not be many people in the film, but the people that you meet are quite remarkable.      The main character in &#145;Signs' is Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a priest that has lost his faith, for reasons that I will let the movie explain. For me, it seems ironic that the main character in the movie is a priest, as they, like all believers of God, are continuing to look for signs that show us why we believe in God in the first place. Graham even admits that these events &#145;might be the end of the world'. Gibson shows himself to be a character full of emotion, sorrow and anger. We discover that local vet, Ray Reddy (M. Night. Shyamalan), has caused a lot of the problems for the town's priest. Living with Graham are his two kids, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin) and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). Morgan is smart kid, knowing a lot of the ideas surrounding &#145;other life-forms', while Bo is constantly paranoid by the drinking of water. In fact Bo is a character that shows signs are appearing that things are not quite right in the world. They all live on a corn and wheat farm where they have discovered the possibility of extra-terrestrials having visited them at their part of the earth.All these actors have to be commended for their performances, as they continue on the feeling that Shyamalan wanted us to feel, a very eerie, depressive and sometimes scary experience. The performances by Culkin and Breslin are truly great. Both show that they can handle themselves in a complex story, only enhancing what sort of movie that we have. Credit in this area also has to go to Shyamalan, as his choices for these roles were crucial to the final make-up of the movie. Also, the way this man can direct young actors is an outstanding talent that I hope continues.A lot of the film is very silent, another deliberate ploy by the director to set his audience up in different way. Roger Ebert said in his review of Signs - &#145;I cannot think of a movie where silence is scarier and inaction is more disturbing'. Many movies that we see, feel they need heaps of noise and action going on, but not here. The sounds (or lack of them), makes &#145;Signs' an even better movie experience. But the times that the movie does require noise, we get it through its powerful soundtrack, the perfect feeling. The score for &#145;Signs' was composed by John Newton Howard. I first watched &#145;Signs' with a friend who was quite adamant about his opinion of the movie. His words were &#145;I did not like &#145;Signs', it is a film that builds-up to nothing'. Now while my friend is entitled to his opinion, I have to say I disagree wholeheartedly with him about that. What he has described is essentially what &#145;Signs' is all about. The true revelation of the film for me is not only how it ends, but what it shows and what we experience through out. Shyamalan has made a film that only he could, because he can. In a time where Hollywood is quite predictable with its movie-making, along comes a guy that breaks all the rules, for all the right reasons. &#145;Signs' is a movie that I can only describe as &#145;one in a million', a film where its build-up is the pay off.

There are so many aspects that are just not up to scratch here, the acting, the characters, the script (especially the plot) and direction, which is as bad as I have seen in a movie in a longtime. O is based on Shakespeare's play called &#145;Othello', but after seeing this film and not liking it, I would rather read Shakespeare or see this story on Broadway, because at least then I would know I might be seeing something better than this garbage.In the elite private school of Palmetto Grove, Odin &#145;O' James is the only black student. He is a NBA hopeful, possessing the talent to go straight from high school to the pros. O is also dating the prettiest girl in the school, Desi Brable. They are the envy of all their friends &#150; having found a love that is deep, honest and pure. O's best friend, Hugo, is on the same basketball team and the son of Coach Duke Goulding. Hugo has been asked by his father to look out for O but, in reality, Hugo is seeking to destroy the very person he pretends to befriend. As his jealousy of O increases, so does Hugo's determination to bring him down. He has a plan, a dark scheme to destroy O and using every conceivable, wicked ploy, he may just do it.The makers of this film cannot avoid getting a spray from me in this review. Director Tim Blake Nelson, did what I would say was an ordinary job in directing &#145;O'. Some of his choices as camera shots are not at all clever or convincing, and the movie has a very &#145;stop\/start' flow that makes it difficult to watch. Nelson needed to look at how Roger Kumble delicately put together Cruel Intentions, because that movie was cleverly directed.However Blake is not the only one who will be getting a serve from me about this film. The screenplay for this film was written by Brad Kaaya and was not as good as it could have been. I like how movies try to use legendary stories from many generations ago, such as Shakespeare, but for some reason this screenplay was just not up to the mark. The plot to the film is just not good enough, as it does not make much sense at many stages, especially at the end. Another bad side to it was the characters developed for the story, such as O and Hugo, who are characters I did not like.Which leads me to the acting in this film. O (Mekhi Phifer) is a guy at the start of the movie that we can see is a huge basketball talent and has a great girlfriend, Desi. Then halfway through the movie this guy turns nasty and from where I viewed it, for no apparent reason, other then listening to the evil plans of Hugo. I do not want to give the whole film away, but there is a scene with O that could have been ok if the film did not over do it. O is going through an NBA trial, which he shows to be a breeze, then after it, he decides to do something that was not very creative, destroying the scene for me. Desi (Julia Stiles) is a very nice girl placed in a situation that is not very good. But for some reason even her character is hard to understand, as some of her lines are just down right silly and\/or corny. From my sources, I heard Stiles did this movie, because of her love for Shakespeare, which is fine. But how blind can this girl be? I mean the script for this film was not up to the standard of some of her other work she has done (like 10 things I hate about you and Save the last dance), a great shame.   Then there is Hugo, played by my best mate (Josh Hartnett). His role once again is not very good. What do people see in this guy? The way he looks is not very convincing, as he continues to look like a little boy in over his head. I have seen him in a few roles where he is the good guy, and I have not liked him. Seeing him as a bad guy here, would you believe, I think is even worse. Another criticism of Hartnett from me is the way he speaks in both his acting and in voice-overs (that were disgraceful!) in this film. To me, Josh sounds like he is &#145;whispering', just not good enough.There are some very distressing scenes in this film, like I have never seen before. O and Desi have a very strange sex scene that I did not find the least bit arousing. You have the sequence at a basketball match where Roger (Elden Henson) is totally harassed and ridiculed, by Michael (Andrew Keegan) and a friend, which is very hard to watch. I know what that guy felt like. Then to top it all of, Hugo's crazy plan is one of the worst parts of a film that I have ever seen. It is unusual, awkward and gut wrenching, especially what we see O do to poor Desi, not pleasant at all.    I am the least bit sorry for being harsh towards this film, as it deserves every bit of criticism it gets. I was hesitant to watch the film and in a way I am glad I did, as I now know how bad it is. I recommend people stay away from &#145;O', instead watch &#145;Cruel Intentions' or &#145;10 things I hate about you', which are much classier movies. Finally this movie has left me with a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth, when it comes to friends and relationships. I know I will be careful choosing both sorts of people in the future.
