I knew as soon as I saw this movie nominated for both best foreign film and best picture that it would definitely win best foreign, and fall to gladiator for best picture. While I enjoyed Gladiator a great deal, it is a crime that CTHD did not win the award it so richly deserved Best Picture of the year 2000. When I first went to see this film, I was among the hordes who were blown away by the stunning cinematography, incredible action choreography and amazing wire work. Truly a remarkable action film with amazing filming on location. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite so brilliantly green as the bamboo forest that is but a small location shot in this movie. The first viewing proved to me that I loved this film, but it did not prove to me that it was the best picture of the year. That took 2 viewings. I highly recommend to anyone who has seen this film and enjoyed it that you go see it again. I found (since I don't speak Chinese) that seeing it a second time while already knowing the story allowed me to concentrate less on reading subtitles, and more on the actors and their performances. It was amazing to me to peel back the layers of the initially strong performances in this film and see the incredible amount of nuance that each of the leads provided in their portrayals. After seeing it the second time, I had a whole new take on almost every piece of dialog in the film. The first scene between Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh most definitely sets the tone for this film, and contrary to what many would have you believe it is not a tone of rollicking action\/adventure. It is instead a tone of yearning, tragedy and love found too late, then lost. This movie, packed with stunning fights and amazing flying martial artists is not so much about fighting, as it is about the Chinese values of loyalty, honor and duty, and how these admirable values can ultimately keep one from truly being happy. It is the story of a love denied too long, and accepted too late. I am not ashamed to say that I wept openly at the end of this film both times that I saw it. The power of the story and the performances were so strong that I felt a small shadow of the loss that the characters in the film felt, and even this small shadow was enough to make me weep. For those of you who find nothing but swordfights and blood in this movie, nothing I can say will change your mind; but for those who have an inkling that this film is about much more than fighting and bloodshed, go see it again and buy it when it is released on DVD. You will not for one instant be sorry that you did. ","genre":null},{"date":"25 January 2014","score":"","review":" No matter what Oscar says.

Are Carlsen and the spacegirl dead or are they preserved in the spaceship crystal coffins as before?

","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"25 January 2014","score":"","review":" Directed and written by Anthony Hickox, the movie has everything that a horror movie fan might love. Often cited as the first self-referential horror movie. Its showcase in a waxwork museum own by a mysterious, Mr. Lincoln (David Warner) and his midget & lurch like minions. These aren't your typical Vincent Price's 1953's House of Wax figures exhibit though, each one depicts a different story of death and murder by evil creatures. Nearly all the classic monsters are in this movie, ranging from the werewolf (John Rhys-Davies), Count Dracula (Miles O'Keeffe) to etc. stock characters. Some of them worth mentioning are Frankenstein's monster, the mummy, Phantom of the Opera, and zombies. There are some homage to other movies characters in the film such as the pod from Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), the killer plant from The Little Shop of Horrors (1960) & the demon baby from It's Alive (1974). They even added the villainous real life historic figure Marquis de Sade (J. Kenneth Campbell) to the mixed. Warner & Campbell give the best performances from all the villains. It's too bad, the actors acting like solid wax models couldn't act still, as they were blinking, and slightly moving. They are not supposed to look alive, until the victim looking at the exhibit, overstep the borders of the exhibit. If they do, they're transform into the world of the display. If you die in their world, you die in real life. The movie is full of the 1980's horror clichés cheese archetypes, as a group of most unlikeable spoil rich university yippee students enter the evil museum. I found Mark Loftmore (Zack Galligan) as a great lead, but he was such a jerk. Mark's need for caffeine is introduced early in the first film, then it's promptly dropped and never goes anywhere. Plus, how on earth is he getting his facts about killings, before there isn't any clues of the crimes? It's like his character just jump over the script. The way, Zack acts is so wooded. Then there is Sarah Brightman (Deborah Foreman), the 'good' virgin girl who all for sadomasochism pain humiliation. It's really bugs me that she is a stupid damsel in distress type of a character, who not only doesn't want to rescue, but beg the bad guy to continue to torture her because she got an orgasm. She is like the wet dream of wife beaters everywhere. No strong feminism here. Even China Webster (Michelle Johnson) the archetype whore character, who seems like she is against vampires at first, gives up and surrendering herself to Dracula. Why, because women will fall in love with dangerous abusing men as long as they are handsome! What crap message is that!? The acting from these two are mediocre, at best. The only good thing about them are both women are just beautiful. Tony (Dana Ashbrook) come off a drug- addict idiot who you knew, is going to get killed off, first. So, no surprised there. Since Writer\/director Anthony Hickox wrote the screenplay in only 3 days, the plot doesn't make much sense. The movie tries to explain more, through wheel chair bound Uncle, Sir Wilfred (Patrick Macnee), a former hunter of the supernatural, but it just set up more questions than answers. Then there is the bit about the wax sculptures being from the most evil men from the past, and they need victims to come back alive. Excuse me, this doesn't make any sense. Nearly none of those horror characters were alive, besides Jack the Ripper & Marquis de Sade. Somehow, I think the movie was trying to put Adolf Hitler in the film; seeing how much they mention fascism in the film. The movie made no more mention about Mark's attic and the glowing book of the Marquis de Sade in a trunk. What was that about? The ending is kinda weird, as the most evil creatures that ever live is against a group of old people getting their butt kick. I thought these were the most evil creatures that ever live? Also, what are the victim now bad guys? I can understand those who turn into monsters, but I can't see the old hunter teaming up with the werewolf that he just try to kill earlier in the film. This film is OK with its combination of horror and comedy. The movie has this weird hate\/love relationship with smoking cigarettes that you will probably catch on. There is a Phantom of the Opera joke, that was supposed to be meant for Jason Vorhees from the Friday the 13th films about people making movies about anything these days, but they (the producers) couldn't get the rights for the character. The dialogue is full of cheesy one liners. You will get over the top gorn, spraying blood, mutilated flesh, and people getting rip apart. In some versions, the film was cut by the MPAA due to gore in the vampire sequence. It's badly edited, so just find the original copy. The set designs are really good & well captured. I love the black & white look of the zombie sequence. Amazingly accurate & professional looking, considering the films low budget. The score by Roger Bellon changes depending on which monster or era were in & is done in the classical scores of the famous Universal horror movie scores of the 30's\/40's. The music choices are pretty hip. Look out for other horror movies references like the missing posters that looks like the posters from 1987's Lost Boys or the painting from 1989's Lobster Man from Mars. There is a sequel, 1992's Waxwork II Lost in Time worth checking out, but it's not as good as this movie.

Often cited as the first self-referential horror movie. Its showcase in a waxwork museum own by a mysterious, Mr. Lincoln (David Warner) and his midget & lurch like minions. These aren't your typical Vincent Price's 1953's House of Wax figures exhibit though, each one depicts a different story of death and murder by evil creatures. Nearly all the classic monsters are in this movie, ranging from the werewolf (John Rhys-Davies), Count Dracula (Miles O'Keeffe) to etc. stock characters. Some of them worth mentioning are Frankenstein's monster, the mummy, Phantom of the Opera, and zombies. There are some homage to other movies characters in the film such as the pod from Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), the killer plant from The Little Shop of Horrors (1960) & the demon baby from It's Alive (1974). They even added the villainous real life historic figure Marquis de Sade (J. Kenneth Campbell) to the mixed. Warner & Campbell give the best performances from all the villains. It's too bad, the actors acting like solid wax models couldn't act still, as they were blinking, and slightly moving. They are not supposed to look alive, until the victim looking at the exhibit, overstep the borders of the exhibit. If they do, they're transform into the world of the display. If you die in their world, you die in real life. The movie is full of the 1980's horror clichés cheese archetypes, as a group of most unlikeable spoil rich university yippee students enter the evil museum. I found Mark Loftmore (Zack Galligan) as a great lead, but he was such a jerk. Mark's need for caffeine is introduced early in the first film, then it's promptly dropped and never goes anywhere. Plus, how on earth is he getting his facts about killings, before there isn't any clues of the crimes? It's like his character just jump over the script. The way, Zack acts is so wooded. Then there is Sarah Brightman (Deborah Foreman), the 'good' virgin girl who all for sadomasochism pain humiliation. It's really bugs me that she is a stupid damsel in distress type of a character, who not only doesn't want to rescue, but beg the bad guy to continue to torture her because she got an orgasm. She is like the wet dream of wife beaters everywhere. No strong feminism here. Even China Webster (Michelle Johnson) the archetype whore character, who seems like she is against vampires at first, gives up and surrendering herself to Dracula. Why, because women will fall in love with dangerous abusing men as long as they are handsome! What crap message is that!? The acting from these two are mediocre, at best. The only good thing about them are both women are just beautiful. Tony (Dana Ashbrook) come off a drug- addict idiot who you knew, is going to get killed off, first. So, no surprised there. Since Writer\/director Anthony Hickox wrote the screenplay in only 3 days, the plot doesn't make much sense. The movie tries to explain more, through wheel chair bound Uncle, Sir Wilfred (Patrick Macnee), a former hunter of the supernatural, but it just set up more questions than answers. Then there is the bit about the wax sculptures being from the most evil men from the past, and they need victims to come back alive. Excuse me, this doesn't make any sense. Nearly none of those horror characters were alive, besides Jack the Ripper & Marquis de Sade. Somehow, I think the movie was trying to put Adolf Hitler in the film; seeing how much they mention fascism in the film. The movie made no more mention about Mark's attic and the glowing book of the Marquis de Sade in a trunk. What was that about? The ending is kinda weird, as the most evil creatures that ever live is against a group of old people getting their butt kick. I thought these were the most evil creatures that ever live? Also, what are the victim now bad guys? I can understand those who turn into monsters, but I can't see the old hunter teaming up with the werewolf that he just try to kill earlier in the film. This film is OK with its combination of horror and comedy. The movie has this weird hate\/love relationship with smoking cigarettes that you will probably catch on. There is a Phantom of the Opera joke, that was supposed to be meant for Jason Vorhees from the Friday the 13th films about people making movies about anything these days, but they (the producers) couldn't get the rights for the character. The dialogue is full of cheesy one liners. You will get over the top gorn, spraying blood, mutilated flesh, and people getting rip apart. In some versions, the film was cut by the MPAA due to gore in the vampire sequence. It's badly edited, so just find the original copy. The set designs are really good & well captured. I love the black & white look of the zombie sequence. Amazingly accurate & professional looking, considering the films low budget. The score by Roger Bellon changes depending on which monster or era were in & is done in the classical scores of the famous Universal horror movie scores of the 30's\/40's. The music choices are pretty hip. Look out for other horror movies references like the missing posters that looks like the posters from 1987's Lost Boys or the painting from 1989's Lobster Man from Mars. There is a sequel, 1992's Waxwork II Lost in Time worth checking out, but it's not as good as this movie.

This film came during a time period where there were hardly any special effects and where films mainly use humans\/real-life characters to tell the narrative. This wonderful film is a sweeping, majestic beauty that tells a love story amidst one of the most famous historical revolutions of modern times; the Russian Revolution of 1917. Boasting an excellent score by Maurice Jarre as well as amazing, sweeping cinematography, Doctor Zhivago is a film that everyone should watch because this is how you make a film.David Lean's historical epic, set during the Russian Revolution, is essentially a love story between an army doctor who was drafted named Zhivago and a beautiful, young girl named Lara.This film has plenty of stars and it consistently relies on human power to tell this story and does so effectively. Omar Sharif does an excellent job in the title role and you like his character because he is sentimental to a fault and in general tries to be the best man he can be. Julie Christie is marvelous as Lara. Alec Guinness, while not shown much is effective in his role as Zhivago's half-brother. Rod Steiger also does a very good job in his role. Finally, I noticed that Charlie Chaplin's daughter is in this film and she does a pretty decent job.Overall, this is a majestic film that will be sure to knock you off your feet. However, this film is not perfect. The film is at a very time-consuming 200 minutes and sometimes I felt the story may have dragged on a bit. I also had an issue with the very last scene and it does not work well in the large context of the story and it seemed rushed. Other than that, this is a work of art and one that should be shown in film classes for the rest of eternity. I rate this film 9\/10.

Though he got himself a very interesting subject in loosely adapting the story of real-life murderer Charles Starkweather, his writing made me find the story dull after just a couple of minutes and the one and a half hours running time felt like an eternity.Admittedly, the relationship the two protagonists have can make for some good scenes from time to time and the car chase (70's car chase, mind you) near the ending for once also brings some excitement to the film, but altogether, Malick really stretches the story out way too long and remarkable moments are very sparse. Even the beautiful landscape quickly loses its touch, as the three (for whatever reason) cinematographers can't come up with ways to give the film an appealing look. Especially when compared to the visual splendour of some of Malick's later works, it's almost unbelievable how generic everything looks in Badlands. The acting can't carry the film either and the chemistry of Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek is absolutely weak, making the characters' feelings and thoughts not any clearer it all.I've noticed most people feeling more positive about this film than I do and I really attempted to understand some of their arguments, but to me, Terrence Malick completely wastes a great premise and has his film lacking any sort of recognition value.

We read the subtitles and did not feel like we were missing any details -- only that a world had suddenly been opened for us to view. Since we saw this film, we have discussed it and persuaded others to experience this enchantment. Every so often we talk about this movie and plan to see it many more times. This DVD should be shown in wide-angle format in order to see all of the majesty captured on cellulose.The script creates a perfectly logical connection between fantasy and reality, logic and irrationality, and mythology and truth. This flow makes it easy to suspend disbelief and be completely entrapped within the breathtaking beauty and fierce fights of the movie.Yun-Fat Chow is Li Mu Bai, and he displays a spiritual countenance that is the center of a true martial arts master. His life has been in service and honor toward the sword *The Green Destiny.* The complexities of his life and his choices are only a background for the intricacies of romance, tragedy, heroism, and philosophy that are woven with precise skill and art throughout this astonishing movie.Michelle Yeoh (Yu Shu Lien) and Zhang Ziy (Jen) become acquaintances, then friends, then sisters, and finally enemies. The transitions are created by the strong will of the young princess (Zhang) who ultimately learns the value of friendship, but at great cost. She is well trained in the ninja arts by Li Mu Bai's ancient arch nemesis. This training is significant because rivals do tend to reveal the inadequacies of their opponents while assuring their young students with victory.The action scenes are stimulating and plausible though the stunts are physically impossible -- or so it seems. What is most amazing is that these impossible stunts were real! The actors did the scenes, perhaps stunt doubles for some, though I doubt it because of Ang Lee's determination for accuracy. When the warriors fly through the air, fight on the sides of building, chase across the rooftops, or fight high in the bamboo trees they did exactly that. These were not created through simulation and the magic of technology.After the scenes were filmed then the digital artists worked to remove the equipment that helped the actors complete the feats. The visions of China and the exciting ninja action captured my imagination.Ang Lee required the actors to learning to speak Mandarin Chinese. The language accuracy may not seem important to those of us who do not speak Chinese, but it is the difference between cultures within China. I was left with the feeling that I had spent time in a sacred place.Throughout the film there is the artistry of the music. Segments will take you to dreamland while other sequences will cause a rush of adrenaline. It is as if you are riding on a magic carpet -- you are there.I purchased two DVDs -- one for me and one for my nephew -- *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* is that good.It is better than five stars for the director (Ang Lee), cinematography, choreography, film editing, script, actors, action, philosophy, and emotions.

Starts off as a brother and sister driving home for the holidays. They of course get to a lonely stretch of the highway and crazy enough a old rusty farm truck comes bolting up behind them. Tailgating ,hand on the horn and swerving everywhere . The brother and sister concerned they are going to be run off the road by a crazed driver with the number plate BEATNGU move over for the truck as it speeds past .Great , awesome, predictable start but not bad so far. Little further down the road they see the same car stopped at a small country church so the slow down slightly and catch a glimpse of what seems to be a man in a hat and large coat carrying a bag shaped like a body with blood on it throwing it down a large pipe coming up from the ground. The driver\/man notice the brother and sister . Gets back into his truck and catches up to them and tries to run them off the road a once again. Afterthe big mucho brother who looks like he would snap like a twig insists they go back to the church and check out the pipe.It's a horror movie remember so of course we have to have some idiot with a bad idea to get the movie started. So going back to check out the crazed mans pipe and not king I the police is need. I'm starting to enjoy this movie . The brother proceeds to crawl inside the pipe with the sister holding on to him up top. Things get hard so she loses her grip and he slides down the pipe. Of course. At the bottom, he finds hundreds of bodies sewn together.I'm starting to really enjoy this movie . The brother gets out before BEATNGU gets back and they bolt to the nearest cafe . Getting touch with the local police to tell them what they have seen . Police go to have a local and apparently the old church is on fire burning down to the ground. I like this movie, my minds starts ticking about where this story will lead us . Old man tries to get young drivers to drag race him on the roads hence his number plate BEATNGU - beating u . But when he is losing he runs them off the roads, watches them die, gets the guilts so takes them to his secret pipe and tries to fix the horrific injuries by sewing them back together. Once he knows the police will be on to him he burns church down to core his tracks. Pretty good story . Nope. At cafe some weirdo rings up and talks about some crap and monsters and stuff. The man driving the car crazy with the body at the church is apparently a monster his named the Creeper who comes to feed on people for a week or so only once every 20 years or something.So The creeper has wings but someone taught him to drive , it's also not a automatic car so he must have had a few lessons so he doesn't stall it all the time. Quicker to fly for him if he only has a week to get food. Someone taught the monster to sew on a sewing machine. Would love to see him thread that needle with his weird hands and sharp long nails. He looked so pretty hunched over the sewing machine . The Creeper even took time out to get some personalised number plates for himself, BEATNGU actually stands for Be eating you. The creeper sure knows how to waste the small amount of time he has every 20 years . Why would you bother spending hours at DMV for a set of frightening number plates that no one guess the meaning to them correctly anyway. Then we have the church burning down. Why bother when the creeper could have easily just eaten the police that came anyway. Once we find out the Creeper story the movie just is stupid. Nothing gets answered and the first part of the movie no longer makes sense . What's even more interesting and stands out a lot in the second jeepers creepers . The Creeper has a thing for boys, he seems completely uninterested in girls.

But if the creators can compromise on the fact the movie can be rated Documentary then a real-life event can be adapted. But this movie is neither a documentary nor it has stupid goose chases. Still wins in every aspect of movie making and the credit goes to the director's mammoth effort and enacting it on the screen by Hero.Many movies had limited characters with which the movie churns its story, here it has been limited to ONE.

Effective utilization of the resource, logic for his actions and the pain, agony that the character goes through everyday are the selling point of this epic.There has been very little use for special effects team, but for the limited usage they have done a exceptional job.

We meet a young attorney named Jonathan Harker who is supposed to venture to Dracula's castle to arrange some kind of real estate whatever stuff. The last guy who went there ran into some snags. No big deal, though. He goes, and there begins a series of deafening and flagrant omens, none of which seem to deter or even catch the attention of young Harker en route.It seems as though every stop is being pulled out on Jonathan Harker's journey to let him know that danger is near. Many find the casting of Keanu Reeves in the role laughably wrong-headed, but if you think about it, he's the only one with a blank and vapid enough stare to be believable as someone who manages to miss the most aggressively blatant signs of suspicion.Meanwhile, Sir Anthony Hopkins plays Professor Van Helsing as a guy who may not be able to save victims of wolf rape, but sure can explain the hell out of it. Now, there is a lot that transpires between the voyage to Salvador Dali's Looney Tunes night terror and the werewolf violation, but Coppola and his creative team show every brazen sign of being far more interested in parades of extravagance and ceremonious tableau than with narrative power. The movie is extraordinarily theatrical in how it favors intensification over flow.The lavish use of expressionism reaches to such heights that it ends up eliciting unwanted laughter. Every set, every backdrop, every detail, foreshadowing, subtext, atmospheric flourish and mere shadow on the wall is screamed at us. It makes Tim Burton look like a Scandinavian minimalist. But all the same, it can be fun letting yourself get swept up in the energy and exhilaration of the whole go-for-broke enterprise.It does, after all, salvage the title character from the creative flatness of most of his other movie interpretations, and then some. I'd argue that Werner Herzog's Nosferatu takes the cake as the more deeply affecting choice, but I mean, it didn't have wolf rape or baby-eating nymphomaniacs or Tom Waits as an insane guy. Or wolf rape. And Gary Oldman is here. And Sir Anthony Hopkins. They've never detracted from the quality of any movies either have been in as far as I can tell. But more to the point, as the movie sees it, there is a reason why the three Oscars it happened to win were for makeup, costume design and sound editing. It was also nominated for one more, and that was art direction. By now, you surely see the common thread As a sensory experience, it's a gasser.

Here is a well-made action movie done with skill and great artistry, yet it tells a story that it is hard to care anything about. It presents a wonderfully bizarre villain in The Joker, while pushing the hero into the shadows and never taking advantage of the opportunity to get inside his head.That's a major misstep because out of all the superheroes, Batman is the most interesting. He is a figure of deep psychological complexity. Unlike Superman, who sees the world from the air and possesses a body that is impervious to pain, Batman sees the world from the ground up, and hobbles home every night to nurse not only his wounds but his personal demons. He is so deeply damaged by what he has experience that it traps him into a personal prison, a batsuit, to do a job that he knows will never be finished.Approaching that deeply troubled soul might have seemed a reasonable assignment for a director like Tim Burton, whose films are dark and broody and often tilted in favor of the outsider. He clearly wants to pull Batman out of light of the campy 60s TV series and put him back into the shadowy world of film noir, where he belongs. Yet, his Batman is curiously muted. Instead of telling a story about a troubled character, Burton's film is a standard ordinary Batman adventure in which The Caped Crusader attempts to bring down The Joker. Ho-hum. We can read that in a comic book.The film isn't a complete waste. It is evenly split between elements that work and elements that don't. To our surprise, the element that doesn't work is Batman himself, and his alter-ego Bruce Wayne. As played by Michael Keaton, Batman is a shadowy figure who appears from nowhere in a rubber suit to terrorize Gotham City's criminal population and then disappear as quickly as he came. As Bruce Wayne, Keaton seems way too calm for a man dealing with, as he calls it, a head full of bad wiring. He doesn't look much like a billionaire, more like a guy who works for one.Jack Nicholson, however, is right on target. He gives a splendid, virtuoso performance as The Joker, a role that he seems born to play. He's on screen very soon and very often. So often, in fact, that he really becomes the bulk of the movie. There are moments when The Joker has so many scenes that we tend to forget that Batman is even around. That might have something to do with the fact the scenes involving Bruce Wayne are kind of dry and dull. Even his love story with press photographer Vicki Vale seems somewhat inevitable. They're drawn together by the plot, not by personality. The scene in which she finds out his true identity is one of the dullest reveals that you've ever seen. They don't seem to really care about each other. Vale, as a character is incomplete. She's introduced as a photographer who travels to war zones to record the carnage, but then she becomes just a damsel in distress.As uninvolving as this story is, you can't deny the craft involved. Gotham City looks like a suburb of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Created by the last Anton Furst, the architecture of the city makes it look like it was put together out on the spur of the moment, not out of necessity. It stands for the twisted nature of the corruption of the city itself. You could only wish that the story and the cast of characters were as well designed. This is a movie of great craft but of little characterization. It's not a bad movie, just an uneven and unsatisfying one.**1\/2 (of four) ","genre":null},{"date":"25 January 2014","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" There are so many things to like about Tim Burton's Batman, and yet just as much that annoys and frustrated me that I find myself in a state of praising and criticizing it almost in equal measure.

In the film she plays the title character, a housewife who is forced to work as a waitress after her husband leaves her. Through hard work she manages to start a chain of restaurants but even this isn't good enough for her spoiled daughter (Ann Blyth) who she most wants to make happy. Director Michael Crutiz was without question the perfect choice for this picture because he could handle just about any type of picture and this one here has quite a few different genres going on. For starters, the opening is going to remind you of some of the best film noirs out there but once we hit the flashbacks we've basically got a story about a hard working mother, an ungrateful daughter, various men and of course some melodrama. All of this is thrown into the mixer and it comes out perfectly thanks in large part to the direction but also the performance of Crawford. It's easy to see why she wanted this part so much and it's easy to see why it brought her career some much needed fire that it needed. The performance is simply flawless no matter what type of emotion the actress needs to play. You believe her early in the film when she's the housewife. You believe when she's the struggling single mother. The scenes where she is hurt by her daughter's actions contain some of the greatest acting you're going to see from the legendary star. Crawford really eats up this character and delivers something quite memorable. Blyth is also wonderful in her role of the brat daughter and I think everyone who watches this film will want to slap her. The supporting group are all excellent as well with Zachary Scott, Jack Carson and Eve Arden really standing out. Bruce Bennett is also very good as the first husband. You can tell Warner went all out with this picture. There's a brilliant score, beautiful costumes and the sets are just flawless. MILDRED PIERCE might be melodrama but it's of the highest quality.
