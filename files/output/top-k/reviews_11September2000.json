Now, McQuarrie steps up to the plate, not only writing, but also directing this film, The Way of the Gun. The previews for this movie make it look like fairly fluffy entertainment. The combination of pop songs with the funniest-looking bits from the film make it appear to be a buddy pic\/action-comedy. The Way of the Gun, however, is actually one of the darkest, most joyless crime films I've seen in a long time. (The misleading nature of the preview is clear from the one scene that usually caps it off. Ryan Phillipe, running across a courtyard somewhere in Mexico, fires his shotgun and then runs for a fountain - on top of which is a huge bag of money. The preview then blacks out, and he is heard screaming. The assumption is that he simply hurt himself because he's an uncoordinated fool. Typical action slapstick. In fact, the only reason he's screaming is because the bagmen he and his partner are shooting it out with have filled the inside of the empty fountain with piles of broken glass. Not really very funny.) I won't go into the plot in much detail, since anyone who's seen the preview has a pretty good idea of what goes down in the film. The biggest problem with this film is that there's a comedy inside it that seems to want to get out. The situations are ludicrous enough, so why can't writer\/director McQuarrie let us laugh at them occasionally? The actors all do their best with the material - James Caan and Benicio Del Toro are both very good, and even Ryan Phillipe, who hasn't proved himself as an actor yet, isn't too bad - but for most of the film they are given no credible dialogue, and their characters are all woefully underdeveloped. There are a lot of movies running around in McQuarrie's head - Del Toro and Phillipe's characters, Longbaugh and Parker, have the same last names as the real Cassidy and Sundance, for example - but he can't seem to synthesize them, or even make anything interesting of them. Here's an example of what a mess this film is BOOM MIKES ARE VISIBLE IN FOUR DIFFERENT SCENES! I saw The Way of the Gun on opening weekend, so these shots will probably be edited out by the time it makes its way to video, but still, nothing destroys a film's credibility faster than visible boom mikes. It's not even that the mikes are barely visible. At some points they hang down so far past the frame line that the entire boom is visible. Their movement from character to character can even be seen sometimes! Once, the boom appears from the left and seems to be an additional character, since it sticks around long enough for us to learn what it looks like and how it works. What were the editors thinking? All in all, a very weak film.

What this film is about is human emotions, family relations and, of course, the huge battle sequences.

If you haven't seen the film, stop reading now.What a weird film!. It belongs to no specific genre, but is a mixture of drama, teen comedy, police-thriller, and horror genres. The film is a tongue-in-cheek, (almost) black comedy about three girls who try to conceal a murder, and the results of their deception.At first the film seemed like a typical movie for teens, about three girls who were the modern version of the Pink Ladies in Grease. (You know, the girls who rule the school.). But within the first few moments, you are in for a big surprise.One bit that bothered me was that the girls did not take enough care with the dead body.  When they took the body from the car and went up the stairs in Liz's house, Courtney and Julie were touching the dead girl's flesh with their bare hands. They only put gloves on when they handled the body in the bed. Then, after handling the body, Marcie and Courtney removed the gloves and proceeded to leave fingerprints all over the place. In reality, the police would have been able to catch them quite easily.One point in the film is open to interpretation. That is, did Courtney arrange for the man to have sex with the dead body? The obvious answer is no, and that Courtney had sex with the guy in the bed so that the man's semen would be left on the bed. However, the presence of the man's semen on the bed would only prove that he was there, and would be, at best, only very strong circumstantial for murder.I believe that Courtney wanted the police to believe Liz was raped. I base that on the following bit of dialogue that occurs when the three girls are in Liz's bedroom just after they prepare the bodyCourtney They'll see that she was raped. Julie         You can't just say she was raped because she's laying on the bed with her legs spread.I believe that Julie's comments made Courtney realize she had to make it look like Liz was really raped. And the only way to do this would be to have the man have sex with the dead body. If Courtney didn't do this, the police, because they use proper forensic procedures, would know the body wasn't raped. If there was no evidence of penetration or semen in the vagina, no one would think it was rape.In another scene, Courtney saysThey'll believe it because it's their worst nightmare. Elizabeth Purr, the very picture of teenage perfection, obliterated by perversion.Murder alone would be not be perverted enough for the appearance that Courtney was trying to achieve, but Liz being raped and murdered would be.In the scene where the man is shown humping, he is superimposed over an image of the dead body. This same technique of superimposition is used when Julie walks down the hall and passes a kneeling student. The director is playing with the nature of reality with this technique. Therefore, the fact that we do not directly see the man having sex with the body, does not mean he didn't. I believe the superimposition technique suggests a link between the humping man and the body, which could be interpreted that he is penetrating her.  Also, I think the director only suggested the rape because showing it in a more obvious manner would probably have been too much for the audience. (N.B. The fact that we see Courtney on top of the man proves that she had sex with him at some stage in the proceedings. It doesn't mean he didn't have sex with the dead body as well.)There was also a problem with the character Fern. When she found the girls out, they bribed her to keep quiet by letting her join their cool group. Fern was an A student and a person with character. She would not be the type of person to become an accomplice after the fact. A make-over would not be sufficient motivation for her to keep quiet.I loved the surrealistic scene where Julie was walking down the hall with the principal's voice in the background announcing the death of Marcia's friend. The others students are as still as statues, and one looks to be praying. There was no music. All you hear is the principal's voice and the clack-clack of Marcia's footsteps. The scene made me feel uneasy.Three brief scenes showing the girl's classes were brilliant. First, In Julie's English class, the topic was Shakespeare's play, Macbeth. (The play is about a man who suffered extreme guilt because he committed a murder.)We see Julie's reaction to the teacher discussing this guilt and we really understand how guilt is eating at Julie. The second scene was a very macabre one about human anatomy. The third scene, a home economics lesson, was also macabre.  The teacher had the students practice cracking open eggs. The students open their eggs and, when a Gothic student observes one of the eggs being opened, she points to it and says, Cool, you got a still born.All the male characters play a secondary role to the female characters. In one scene, the father can not stand up to his daughter. Also, the tough detective is female.The DVD is great. In the director's commentary, Darren Stein tells us why he made the film, he shares with us how the film Carrie influenced him, and he explains what he was thinking about when he directed particular scenes, His comments are especially enlightening considering he was not only the director, but also the writer.

Ehren Kruger is a screenwriter who is currently one of the hottest commodities on the market right now, but his work seems to rely on an approach that may have been successful in his initial efforts, but nearly leads to the self-destruction of Reindeer Games. His Arlington Road was a solid, underrated little thriller and contained a twist ending so jarring and effective that one could easily overlook how contrived it really was due to its reliance on one character predicting EXACTLY what another character would do. Scream 3 was another Kruger-penned script that contained a villain whose master plan hinged on their ability to predict the characters' actions. Alas, Kruger takes this approach to ludicrous lengths in Reindeer Games. The story may revolve around the robbery of a casino, but it soon becomes apparent that the villains would be better off just abandoning their task and making twice as much money by starting up their own psychic network.Not that the script's deficiencies make Reindeer Games unwatchable. Overall, the film is a fairly passable way to kill 100 minutes and would probably have come across better as a direct-to-video quickie. The entire project just seems rather lackluster, considering the talent involved, as the first-rate cast fails to rise above the material and John Frankenheimer's direction is unspectacular at best. The action fails to generate much in the way of excitement, due mainly to the contrived fashion through which much of it is set up (Ben Affleck's hero pours alcohol into a water pistol because he just KNOWS that the bad guy will stop to light up a cigarette before shooting him). Indeed, most of the fun comes from trying to pick apart the absurdities in Kruger's script.One of the liabilities of loading a story with many surprise twists is that they have to be adequately explained in order for them to make sense. Unfortunately, this has a negative effect on the film's pacing as the characters are constantly forced to stop and talk about the twist that has just occurred so that everything will hold together. Its reminiscent of the classic James Bond moment where the villain explains his grand scheme to the audience, except that it is repeated FIVE OR SIX TIMES throughout Reindeer Games. This all leads us to our twist ending, which like Kruger's previous works, relies on a psychic villain predicting exactly what the hero will do. However, it doesn't take much to realize that the villain's whole scheme is ridiculously convoluted and more trouble than it's worth, especially since the hero's participation is not exactly vital to its success.

True or false If `art' is equal to `creative perfection', and `war' is equal to `horrendous dialogue', then `The Art of War' is equal to `the perfection of horrendous dialogue'.  The answer, both logically and literally, is true.`The Art of War', Hollywood's latest foray into the action genre, displays director Christian Duguay's passion for guns and bombs, and his brazen confidence to use a Technocrane for every shot possible.  (Hey, those things are expensive... but so are good actors&#133; oh, the choices one must make.) Mr. Duguay also likes wide-angle lenses and women's breasts, either at the same time or just alternating back and forth between the two.  And he must absolutely LOVE Anne Archer and Donald Sutherland, or for that matter anyone with a speaking part, since he apparently didn't want to hurt their feelings by telling them to re-do takes because they SUCKED.  I haven't seen acting this bad since George Lucas decided he was a director.  Did I say that out loud?Action-wise, `The Art of War' retains enough intensity and drive to be moderately interesting, however I was disappointed by its refusal to allow more martial arts instead of just bullets, although the audience seemed to enjoy the splooches of blood and guts.  One act of pure visceral violence received actual cheering and clapping.  But, my point is that obviously Wesley Snipes can do karate, so why doesn't he do more?  The opening sequence teases us into thinking all the fights will be engaging and smartly choreographed, but then the movie gets started and, well, then they're not.Plot-wise, this film equals-and possibly surpasses-`The World is Not Enough' in lack of purpose and excess of down-and-dirty obfuscation.  What's it about?  Well, explaining it is like reading the opening pages of a classical Russian novel, with three pages of characters and no sense of how they connect to one another.  There are some bad Chinese guys and some good Chinese guys and there are some good Americans and some bad Americans. They're mad about a trade agreement that is discussed at length during every scene featuring dialogue, however I couldn't tell you for the life of me what it entails or why the movie centers around it.  There's a secret agent who is framed for killing a Chinese ambassador, and then there's a Chinese interpreter who complains a lot and then gets locked in a bathroom with a cell phone that's low on batteries.During what seemed like the two longest hours of my life there are also various acts of violence; stabbings, punctures, slashings, chokings, shootings, beatings, breakings, snappings, crunchings, decapitations, and, everyone's favorite, the classic shard-of-glass-in-the-neck.  Actually, `The Art of War,' despite its name, is not what I would call a violent movie. Instead, I would say that during parts that usually gravitate toward violence, it gravitated&#133; and then smashed onto the surface of Planet Carnage.With regards to the acting, I have much to say but none of it is nice. Donald Sutherland looks like he showed up five minutes after waking up, ran his fingers through his hair, quickly read over his lines, and then ran off to do `Space Cowboys'.  Ann Archer displays an impressive talent for reading lines without any inflection whatsoever, and Wesley Snipes has maybe 20 lines throughout the whole film, all stolen from the trash can of the `Rambo III' scripting room.To conclude, `The Art of War' presumes too much, even going so far as to include `art' in its title.  It presumes that a convoluted story and even more contrived and tortuous dialogue will be enough to interest viewers while they're not watching guns and explosives and the occasional boob.  It presumes that as a contemporary action movie it must drench itself in technology and ridiculous gadgetry, yet refuse to be imaginative with ackwardly placed flashbacks that are in slo-mo grainy black and white.

I was never the biggest fan of the show, but this movie made me wish I were. Also it was great seeing Davey Jones of the Monkees!

I always seem to like success stories where the underdog overcomes circumstances and comes out on top. The script and plot were first class. And the well acted characters made the story so very real.A young woman(Davis)suffers a nervous breakdown due to her domineering mother(Gladys Cooper). After therapy with a noted doctor (Claud Rains), the spinster from Boston becomes a woman of the world. Her appearance changes drasticly. So does her attitude toward life. She now has the courage to stand up to her mother. And the spark that keeps her going is the results of her ocean cruise romance with an unhappily married man played by Paul Henreid.My two favorite scenes are where Davis and Henreid are passengers in a car that accidentally rolls backward down a hill; and of course the double cigarette-lighting scene in the finale. Of course this was the second time that Henreid did such, but this time was the most memorable.Also in the cast are Mary Wickes, John Loder and Ilka Chase.If you haven't seen this movie; by all means rent it or watch for it on AMC. I bet the first time you watch it won't be your last.

But instead what I got was something that resembled a sample table at a grocery store.  The director is giving me little tid-bits here and there on different wrestlers, some of it interesting (Jake the Snake is definitally the high point) and some of it not.  Most of the time things are never followed up and sometimes it feels as if he's trying to introduce too much and doesn't know what to do with all of his footage.Outside this, it offers a glimpse into the world of wrestling and the lives of wrestlers to all those curious. It's worth watching but like the samples at the grocery store, not filling.
