A case can be made that Nolan is even more successful.  The film's over arching themes of denial, and the difficulty of living a life that acknowledges a past, present, and future, keep the conversations going well after the movie ends. Guy Pearce is outstanding and with this role, should begin to be noticed for the versatile actor he is.  Even though Carrie-Anne Moss turns in a credible performance, she will never get out from under Trinity in what may end up being sixteen sequels to The Matrix.  Surprisingly, Joe Pantoliano plays the same character he has been playing for 13 years and as is often the case, does it well.  Remember what your momma told you about practice?Hopefully this is just the beginning for Nolan, yet his next project is an action film with big Al Pacino and (gasp) Robin Williams.  With any luck, he will follow McQuarrie's example rather than Singer's.  Even if he is a one hit wonder, Memento will stand the test of time.

When the advertising for Best in Show had the tagline From the Team That Brought You Waiting for Guffman, a fair number of critics out there implied in their reviews that only people that are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time seeing this film. For shame, critics, for shame times two!  Any critic that implies something like that with any film probably doesn't want to share the film's wealth with the rest of the world, but this is one film that I hope people will experience, now that its video\/dvd. Best in Show is, without a doubt,  the best comedy of 2000.The film begins with a mockumentary style, introducing the main competitors (not to mention screwballs) of the annual Mayflower Best In Show competition, where dogs of all breeds come to compete to see who is the top dog. We have the loveable and gullable Harry Pepper (Guest) with his bloodhound, the simple Gerry & Cookie Fleck (Levy & O'Hara) with their terriors, nut-case yuppies Hamilton & Meg Swan (Hitchcock & Posey), the gay dog groomers Scott Dolan & Stefan Vanderhoof (Higgins & McKean), and the airheaded millionare Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Coolidge) along with her trainer Christy Cummings (Lynch).  They all have their minds on one simple object The Blue Ribbon, which will be awarded to the best dog. And...do I have to tell you the rest?Director\/writer\/star Guest's idea of humor is one that assures me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing at, and that the idiocy of films like American Pie or other pointless teenage flicks won't take over the world after all. His idea is simple make your comedy not just funny, but SMART funny. But instead of following in the brilliant footsteps of films like Zero Effect and High Fidelity, he used a rather unusual approach (and as I understand, he also used this approach for Guffman).

And if you have been watching the numerous Swordfish\/Heineken ads over the last few weeks, there is an expected product placement (I won't tell you what product though I don't want to spoil it ) ) in the first 5 minutes of the movie (which must be some sort of record).Travolta was pretty decent, although I think he was a lot more fun in Face\/Off.  Hugh Jackman is on his way to being a major star... as the protagonist - computer hacker fighting for his daughter he has the makings of a down to earth hero.  As I stated before, Halle Berry's breasts are awesome but she also exudes a sensuality everytime she's on camera (someone please put her in the next Bond or Austin Powers picture).

He brilliantly utilizes the Hitchcockian method of showing less and there by giving the audience more.  By not showing the shark for the first half of the movie and only showing the evidence of its strength and the aftermath of its attacks, Spielberg triggers the audience's imagination making the film all the more suspenseful. Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's screenplay is well written. Now granted, this is not a brilliant character study but the script is more character driven than most of today's blockbuster scripts. Evidence of the screenplay's strong characters can be found in the extraordinary chemistry between them and their motives for their actions. The cast does a fantastic job at giving life and voice to the characters of the screenplay. Roy Scheider wisely underplays his character, Martin Brody, making him very believable. Robert Shaw is absolutely wonderful as the sea-worn fisherman, Quint. Richard Dreyfuss is very convincing as the energetic, young scientist. Lorraine Gary gives a very naturalistic performance as Brody's wife. Murray Hamilton does a nice job at playing the greedy, sleazy mayor of Amity; the town endangered by the shark.Bill Butler's cinematography is first-class. He brings the ocean right into our laps by placing the camera at the water's level. Although there are many continuity errors, Verna Fields's editing is smooth and fast paced. Despite the fact that the shark is not seen for the first half of the film, the movie still manages to be suspenseful and interesting.John Williams's musical score, for this film, has reached legendary status for good reason.

Until recently I wasn't sure I was going to see this movie but on whim, I decided to go and now I know why it's been doing so well. This movie is charming, funny and well told. Shrek (Mike Myers) is a giant green ogre that lives by himself in a swamp. He likes his privacy and is thrown into a fit of despair when all the forest's fairy tail creatures show up at his place. They're there because the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) sent them there after he banished them all from his land. Having his privacy intruded by all these creatures and by a particularly annoying fast talking donkey (Eddie Murphy), he sets off for Farquaad's castle to rectify the problem. And so begins a journey of adventure, love and self-discovery for not only Shrek but also the princess he rescues, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz).I've read some other reviews and there are those that think this movie was over hyped, insensitive to short people and just not very good. I think if you look hard enough you will find almost anything to pick apart. If it's not short people, then it's big fat bald people or the abuse that a donkey takes so I'm not going to put a lot of stock in those who pick things like these out. Look at any Saturday morning cartoon and you'll probably see far worse things. It's a Hollywood movie so put your issues and beliefs aside and enjoy it for what it was, a fun summer movie. The animation was incredible. Animation technology has been advancing at lightning speeds and we saw some of it here. Toy Story 1 & 2 were incredibly well done but Shrek seemed to be a bit better in the emotions department. The character of Shrek exhibited a lot of emotions that I haven't really seen before and the donkey must have been an animator's dream to create. Talk about artistic freedom and as a result, a thoroughly entertaining character. You really do feel a sense of connection with these characters because of how well they were able to exhibit emotions. In some ways I thought that the evil Lord wasn't quite evil enough. I thought that he could have been a bit more menacing but I guess there are some restrictions considering the movie was meant for children. I loved the spoofs they did.

The thought of watching the epic bombing of Pearl Harbour was something I just could not imagine. And to the films credit that part was at least satisfying. However it is quite obvious they did not want to go down the Saving Private Ryan road and do the full on cold hard reality style war film. It is also quite obvious they wanted something there for the ladies to see. This all by itself seems fair, reasonable and smart but the execution is an absolute shocker!There is in essence two films here, a love triangle and a war movie. They have been rolled into one and they fail to complement each other. The war scenes and the love scenes are two seperate entities and the filmmakers never seem to be able to fully roll them into one. It is kind of like 'now lets have them kiss and be lovey dovery', 'now lets bomb that absolute heck out of Pearl Harbour' - does this match? However as sperate films in themselves they lack so much.The love story is not engaging enough. I found myself at the start when the female lead was explaining how she met Affleck I wandering what I had missed. Had I walked in late or something, I was thrown into an already developed relationship and felt lost. The characters in the start of this film get some poor lines to use and the film never sucks you in. I know my girlfreind loved the love story angle just as much as I loved the war scene but she agrees she felt like she was not part of it all. And that is where it fails. The film fails to 'suck us in'. In Titanic we see the lovers before they meet, when they meet, when they have fun, when they fall apart and then finally then end. In this film we jump straight into when they are having fun, have them fall apart and then the end fails to give us any sence of conclusion. And this goes for three hours!!!!The war angle too has its problems! For starters the battles near the start are kinda cool but they are woven into a monologue by Affleck about writing to his girl - boring! Everyone needed a release from the intense love angle trying to be portrayed and some aciton was needed. The we get to the Japanese who in relaity were very barbarrack, patriotic people! The Japanese Admiral says towards the end I fear all we have done is awoken a sleeping giant. What a load of tripe, the reality was the Japanese thought they were going to take over all of Asia and America. As for the films justification of why the 3rd wave was not sent against Pearl is also full of it. The reality is so much more complex and believeable. And of course you must cut most of Alecs and Johns speeches so the American we are so great is no longer there. However the actually bombing was awesome! I could feel the tingle in my throat as the planes flew in! This was what made the movie and made it bearable to watch!!!!!!!!!!!!So all in all what is it? two hours of an uninteresting, unengaging soppy love story mixed with just over an hour of historically inacurate, Americanised war scenes.

From Michael Caines I'm bored performance to the ridiculous looking shark puppet thing, this gets my vote for the worst movie sequel ever. Halloween sequels are Hitchcock masterpieces compared to this thing that has the gaul to call itself a movie. And to think the first movie was nominated for best picture in 1975. So whats wrong with this one. Well let me start my ranting. First off is the slackest direction ever used for any film, EVER. No single scene can entertain in this movie. Its like t.v. movie of the week material infringing its way into theatres. Compare scenes where the shark attacks to those in the other films. In a film like Jaws the director used a slow restraint letting the tension of the moment build. Even if you weren't scared at least you might be entertained by the direction. In this film however there is no restraint. The shark appears, attacks something and the audience is supposed to be scared. Oh me oh my. The only thing scary about these scenes is the horrendous overuse of the Jaws theme in the film. Say your nodding off( which should happen every ten seconds in this movie) all of the sudden the shark attacks, the music swells and your awaken from your peaceful slumber to face the true horror; The Movie ITSELF!!!! Somehow this movie stars of all people Michael Caine. How in the name of god does this dreck star Michael Caine? Well perhaps Caine was on vacation in Jamaica, spent all his money on the trip, and decided to make any movie he possibly could to earn his way home. During the time he was making this he won an academy award for his performance in Hannah and her Sisters, but could not accept. Why? Because he was busy making Jaws The Revenge. No wonder his performance borders on quiet rage, to outright boredom. Next lets attack the story. Did some writer think this story would be in any way interesting. I mean come on a shark stalking a family all the way from Amity to Jamaica. Thats the dumbest idea in the history of dumb story ideas. Not any shark mind you, its a super inteligent vengefull shark, that stalks specefic prey and can spend large amounts of time out of water. And the ending of the film. Did that thing make sense to anyone? Let me just end this paragraph by saying the backwards swimming sharks of Deep Blue Sea seem more plausible than this rusty, wire pulled monstrosity. Well I did get some enjoyment out of one scene. The scene involve the shark coming out of the water, and snatching a screaming helpless victim from a raft. As the shark spends about a minute above the water not moving or chewing on the victim who is still sreaming like she was being eaten alive, I was reminded of Bela Lugosi in Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster, wrestling with an octopus puppet who was supposed to be eating him alive too.

The feature opens with Edward Van Sloan, who appears in the photo-play as Doctor Waldman, coming from behind a curtain and on stage to inform the movie audience on what they are about to see, To present this picture with a friendly warning. Following his phrase and a few more lines, he ends it with, Well, we've warned you. Then the opening credits begin, and unlike some other horror movies of that period, it doesn't open with the underscoring of Swan Lake.Set in an unnamed German village at no particular time period, a young scientist named Doctor Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive), who, with the help of his hunchback assistant, Fritz (Dwight Frye), digs up a recently buried body preceded by a funeral, later fashioning the human body to conduct his experiment to see if he can make it come back to life. Learning of what he is doing, his fiancée, Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), along with his friend, Victor Moritz (John Boles), and Doctor Waldman (Van Sloan) try to stop him, but to no avail. Frankenstein proves his theory to his skeptics by taking the body he has created, now lying on an operating table, and having the table raised through an opening in the roof during a lightning storm. When the table is back in the lab, the hand of the body slowly rises, with Frankenstein yelling those famous words, It's alive, it's alive! Time passes. Frankenstein learns from Doctor Waldman that the brain placed on the Monster (Boris Karloff) is actually a criminal brain stolen from his lab by Fritz. The Monster, in a confused state, is constantly teased by the unsympathetic Fritz with a fire torch, and because of this, the angry Monster hangs Fritz with his own whip. After the Monster leaves the lab and into the countryside, he goes out on his rein of terror.Frankenstein, helped advance the career of Boris Karloff, who would reprise his role in two more sequels. Karloff succeeded into making his monster figure both frightening (compliments of make-up artist Jack Pierce) and yet sympathetic at the same time. Baby boomers who grew up watching this and other classic horror films of the 1930s and '40s presented on local TV stations back in the 1960s and '70s every Saturday night on Creature Features, Fright Night, Chiller Theater, or whatever name it was given, will recall certain scenes from Frankenstein having that sudden editing look, such as the one after the Monster, who accompanies a little girl named Maria (Marilyn Harris), into throwing daisies into the water. After throwing his last daisy, the Monster looks at his empty hands, holds his hands out and...(CUT to next shot). In the scene now restored, the Monster is shown throwing Maria into the water, and running away in a state of confusion. Also deleted but now restored is the scene earlier in the story in which Frankenstein, after seeing his experiment come to life, saying, Oh, in the name of God, now I know what it feels like to be God. Those lines were taken out, leaving the viewer to see Frankenstein's lips moving without hearing words, but dubbed in laughter of hysterics.Unlike the future sequels, Frankenstein concentrates more on plot development, focusing on the leading actors played by Clive, Clarke, Boles and Van Sloan, who they are, etc., before it gets down to business with Karloff's Monster, which appears about 30 minutes from the start of the story. There is no underscoring to help it along, but plenty of extreme close-up shots on the central characters, seeing their expressions and wondering what they are thinking at present. The plot itself would set the pattern for future sequels to come. Also in the cast are Frederick Kerr (who lisps whenever pronouncing any word with an S in it) acting the role as Baron Frankenstein, presented here with some comedy relief; Lionel Bellmore as the Burgomaster, among others. Although John Boles, usually likable playing devoted husbands in dramas or as a singer in light operas, seems out of place here. On a personal level, maybe David Manners, who played the handsome romantic co-star in Dracula, The Mummy and The Black Cat, would have made it work somewhat better as Frankenstein's best friend. Some of the dialog Boles in given to recite somewhat succeeds in weakening the strength of the story. Mae Clarke does get her chance to let out some screams in a classic moment where she is encountered by the Monster in her locked room.On and all, the original sound version of Frankenstein which has a successful run on American Movie Classics in 1991, revived on AMC from 2001 to 2002, and then Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere October 8, 1998), is quite memorable by all means, thanks to video and DVD distributions as well as Karloff's understanding of his character, but its sequel, The Bride of Frankenstein (1935), however, makes up for some weaknesses in the original.

Those lines were taken out, leaving the viewer to see Frankenstein's lips moving without hearing words, but dubbed in laughter of hysterics.Unlike the future sequels, Frankenstein concentrates more on plot development, focusing on the leading actors played by Clive, Clarke, Boles and Van Sloan, who they are, etc., before it gets down to business with Karloff's Monster, which appears about 30 minutes from the start of the story. There is no underscoring to help it along, but plenty of extreme close-up shots on the central characters, seeing their expressions and wondering what they are thinking at present. The plot itself would set the pattern for future sequels to come. Also in the cast are Frederick Kerr (who lisps whenever pronouncing any word with an S in it) acting the role as Baron Frankenstein, presented here with some comedy relief; Lionel Bellmore as the Burgomaster, among others. Although John Boles, usually likable playing devoted husbands in dramas or as a singer in light operas, seems out of place here. On a personal level, maybe David Manners, who played the handsome romantic co-star in Dracula, The Mummy and The Black Cat, would have made it work somewhat better as Frankenstein's best friend. Some of the dialog Boles in given to recite somewhat succeeds in weakening the strength of the story. Mae Clarke does get her chance to let out some screams in a classic moment where she is encountered by the Monster in her locked room.On and all, the original sound version of Frankenstein which has a successful run on American Movie Classics in 1991, revived on AMC from 2001 to 2002, and then Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere October 8, 1998), is quite memorable by all means, thanks to video and DVD distributions as well as Karloff's understanding of his character, but its sequel, The Bride of Frankenstein (1935), however, makes up for some weaknesses in the original.

He takes a movie that would have not been much of a story and totally makes it a masterpiece. I give Zemekis a bit of the credit, but lets see him do the same with, say, George Clooney or some other mediocre actor out there. Helen Hunt didn't really add too much to the movie. I thought she had better chemistry with Hanks as a photo than she did in the scenes together (or was that done on purpose?). It did bother me that the movie was a 2 1\/2 hour commercial for Fedex, but I suppose it could have been worse (I actually enjoyed the dig that was made at the expense of the US Postal Service). While there may be some that feel that the movie is weak in parts, they would say that Hanks saves the day and keeps this ship from sinking. I suppose if at all possible, I would have cast Meg Ryan instead of Helen Hunt (but then it's too much like You've Got Mail\/Sleepless but in reality it might be a bit closer to Joe vs. the Volcano). Bottom line Tom Hanks steals the show and makes a good film an excellent one.
