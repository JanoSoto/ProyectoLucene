[{"date":"1 November 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Rushmore is a brilliantly manipulated exercise in calculated comedy. The actors unique portrayals of their unforgettable characters are superb in the decay that the characters are content with. Wes Anderson truly shines here, this is a piece of cinematic history, and it will be remembered for years to come. It is the best coming of age film, out ranking both The Graduate and Y Tu Mama Tambien. Rushmore has everything that a movie should have; laughter, heartbreak, love, tears, and empathy. I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it. Rushmore is quite amazing in its simplicity. It glorifies the world that it propels itself into at full force.
