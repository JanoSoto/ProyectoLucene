Dancer in the Dark is a great drama. It is a part of his trilogy of the women who makes sacrifies(The Idiots;Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark). I've seen parts of his earlier work, very dark and also with a common theme for the first three, but not as lovable. But ever since I saw The Kingdom, I've seen his genius.Dancer in the Dark is one of those films that hasn't got a large audience, it's the same audience as those who loved Breaking and many of the french movies, and that's probably why many dislike the movie so much. Because it's not a straight Hollywood style movie that has a happy ending or keeps a clean sharp picture to symbolize the straightness that Hollywood and most of the world holds so dear.lars Von Trier never appeals to the large audience, he just hopes that he gets a Golden Palm Award, for him thats enough, that means more and probably should do, because large gatherings of people share their taste and in Cannes it's not the majority like the Golden Globes and Oscar. And this Film is that kind of film, it's a heartbreaking story about a mom who'll sacrfice everything for his son, and as always Von Trier finds the right actors for the parts this is is talent, directing the right actors in his stories.*SPOILER* I must admit I cried in the end of the film, until the silence, that is the enemy in this movie, was replaced by the incredible voice of Bjørk.

The cop is not that different as he is unscrupulous in getting the job done.  A degree of respect is created between the two and this proves to be a hard nut to crack when they finally meet up.This is a high paced action movie shot in the now over recognized John Woo style slow motion, blurred or over emphasized sounds and well choreographed action sequences..  The story unwinds at a steady pace and is definitely an essential view if you like this genre.

Put it this way, if you enjoyed the first MI for its emphasis on teamwork and convoluted storytelling, then don't even bother with the sequel, as the credited director John Woo should give you a damn good idea of what to expect.Tom Cruise returns as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, our intrepid spy who now appears to have a knack for rock climbing and martial arts.  His assignment is to recruit thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton) to go undercover for the agency to spy on renegade agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) and his formidable army of henchmen.  Ambrose has plans of becoming a billionaire, but in doing so, could cause great devastation to the population of Australia.  Naturally, it's up to Hunt to rescue the girl, kill the bad guy, and save the day.Through and through, MI-II never feels like anything less than a Woo production.  Almost all his signatures are here balletic slow motion, two-fisted guns a'blazing, flying doves, and a sort-of gun standoff.  The only thing missing here is the countless gallons of blood we've come to expect.  MI-II, as it turns out, is his first and only PG-13 production, and the lack of ultraviolence didn't bother me in the slightest.What is less forgivable is the almost utter lack of action in the first seventy minutes.  Well, that's not entirely true.  There is that climbing sequence and the car chase not long thereafter, but Cruise doesn't even stand off against his first true nemesis until after an hour in.  What's to hold our attention until then?  Maybe the plot, if you're into typical Bond stuff, which is exactly what this story is, typical Bond material.  We've got the almost megalomaniacal villain (he doesn't want the world, but he wouldn't mind devastating parts of it to get what he wants), the gorgeous love interests, and a few neat gadgets here and there.When the action hits, MI-II is almost a non-stop thrill ride, delivering tense gun battles, a fast-paced and simply awesome motorcycle chase (one of my favorite John Woo action scenes), and a fun mano-a-mano duel to the death.  Cruise is completely convincing as a physical action star, he's got the style, the charisma, and the moves.  He's the star of the show, which might disgust some, but he capably carries the production.  Newton makes for a gorgeous love interest, and Ving Rhames is THE man as Luther Stickell, everyone's favorite computer hacker.  Dougray Scott disappoints as the villain, though, he doesn't conjure enough spite and isn't menacing enough.From beginning to end, if there is one consistency to MI-II, it's how lovely the film looks.  Shot on beautiful locations with a great eye, this is a movie that's always nice to look at.  As such, the film should be enjoyed for what it is, an action blockbuster in the vein of James Bond. Sure, it probably could have used a tad more action in the first half and Woo does go overboard on the slow-mo by the finale, but MI-II is purely fun stuff, and when the action's on-screen, it's exhilarating.

Some of the criticisms of this film are hard to fathom.The screenplay has the tight conciseness of a well-honed play (which this essentially was derived from) and doesn't fail to prick at the emotions and the intellect of the viewer. The photography, the casting and the editing all click together quite admirably.However, I always marvel at the negative, emotionalized responses to otherwise superb films such as this by those who seem to miss the entire point of a movie like Sling Blade.I did not see a political message about abortion, or a justification of murder or even a backhanded putdown of the rural people of Arkansas. (Many of the characters were locals, by the way.) Some viewers are setting themselves up to be against this film since they are wearing their own feelings on their sleeves and fail to see the subtle layers of the story. They are seeing only the reflection of themselves on the surface of the water, rather than the complex world below.Theater and film are rooted in images and characterizations designed to help us explore the human condition. It was once said that Tolstoy's voluminous novel War and Peace could be summed up in a single sentence thereby negating the need to write the book. Art is not a fast explanation, but a captivating and thought-provoking trip that hopefully forces us to think about our own motivations. Taking a one-dimensional view of this film might lead one to believe that Karl Childer's central message is that we should all eat biscuits smeared with mustard.Sling Blade excels at the job of making us examine the terrible choices life gives us by providing a set of characters who interact in a moving, curious and revealing way. It is not reality nor is it political, but a method by which we can look at our own individual realities.Others who seemed disenchanted with this film out-of-hand are those who found it slow. Helloooo! This film is SUPPOSED to be slow and agonizingly so. It is carefully walking you to the conclusion, step-by-step, so you can squirm uncomfortably at the overall foreshadowing. It ain't an explosion-a-minute John Woo filmmaking and it certainly isn't light comedy, though it induces a surprising number of smiles.This is a film that makes us look at true evil in the form of J.T. Walsh, Dwight Yoakum and Robert Duval's characters and compare it to the pure goodness of the damaged creature portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton, whose own brutalization leads him to seek justice in his own imperfect way.To help those out who didn't get this film, I might recommend that you consider Thornton's character to be an amalgamation of Herman Melville's innocently homicidal protagonist in Billy Budd and Mary Shelley's sad monster Frankenstein. These characters, like Thornton's Karl Childers, were dramatic vehicles for the purpose of making us think. They did bad things but we were forced to view them compassionately because they reflected our own conflicting traits.Don't read things into a film that aren't there, but don't ignore the interesting elements that are.

Despite the difficulty this presents with noise etc it works out OK and Jed is able to advise a little on Tracey's abdominal pains.  Andy has bigger problems however with a rapist terrorising his students.  Things get worse when he is implicated in the crimes and Tracey goes into hospital and has an ovary removed.  When it is found that the ovary was healthy Tracey sues Jed and the hospital for $20million and separates from Andy.  However is everything what it seems?I hadn't seen this film before.  Al I remember about it was that it did good business at the time and that it got quite a lot of press for being twisty.  Watching it now I must say that I'm surprised that it did as well as it did.  In my opinion this has more in common with the bottom shelf thrillers in your video shop than a Hollywood blockbuster.  The plot is twisty but just too self-consciously so.  Because you've seen it done hundreds of time before in bad videos, you know what to expect and little is a surprise.  It doesn't help that half the film is a big red herring that is forgotten just as soon as it's set the other half of the plot in motion.It has energy but it is false energy driven by daffy twists and turns.
