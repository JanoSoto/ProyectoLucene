Blues Brothers 2000 was not, which is unfortunate considering the cast and the effort it must have taken to bring together everyone. Sadly they felt the need to infuse some cuteness with a kid who can't sing or act and redo every scene in the original, only in a less fresh way to less effect.That being said, the music is great (outside of the one verse when they let 'Buster' take the lead when it's obvious he can't sing) and the movie is worth viewing once just for that. They did leave some of the music off of the soundtrack, so there are a few gems you'll want to hear on screen. Otherwise the movie is mostly forgettable, and once again shows why sequels to classic movies are so often bad ideas.I gave it a 5, but only because of the music.

There are no heroes, just people that have a certain job to do.  This movie is excellent for many reasons.  For a movie its length, first and foremost, it is extremely entertaining and engaging.  It was a surprisingly quick three and a half hours.    What I really liked most was the time the director, Peterson, took creating suspense, and giving scenes of depth.  Nothing is rushed here, and it all pays off.  What we end up getting is more of a psychological movie, and less of an action picture.  We get characters that have souls and personalities.  We see them change drastically from their cocky beginnings, really as children, to seasoned men.  It is not an easy change, but Peterson takes us with them, through all thier ups and all of their downs.  What seems like a small accomplishment and brings them joy, can quickly swing the other way and create a huge amount of drama in their lives.  Not only do we see them change with reactions to what is happening to them by outside forces, but what its like to have to live in a confining space, to have nothing to do. The claustrophobic atmosphere is a huge part of the movie.  This movie is also about the human condition, and innocence lost.  We see how naive the characters can be, thinking they can be heroes, and how they grow.  We watch them lose the innocence.      I really could say a lot of things to praise this film.  I loved it.  It was also different to see war from a more German point of view, which, in this day in age, seems to be the same as everyone elses view on war.  There is no glorification of war here, and thats refreshing.  It is an honest movie with people someone can relate to.  Very satisfying in the end.  10 out of 10.

Basically, some humans are on an island inhabited by prehistoric monsters. To spice it up, the monsters are supposed to be super intelligent and able to talk to each other. Not clever enough to beat the humans unfortunately, who will live to make another monster movie probably. The special effects seem better than the first two efforts (JP and JPII) though the plot is so transparent it has to be enlivened with devices like a monster swallowing a mobile phone that then rings and can be heard from outside its body (duh!). The most familiar scene is some human(s) get wedged into a small space (eg car, hollow tree, whatever) and the monsters head is just slightly too big to get in and eat them, leaving them to play the scene again in a different corner. After seeing this numerous times I reckoned I'd got the idea and had a doze. Nice afternoon's big screen junk food - don't go and see it alone though - you'll need someone to talk to afterwards so you don't feel you've entirely wasted the evening.
