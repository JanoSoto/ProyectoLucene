I am not giving anything away since anyone that knows a bit of history knows that the Titanic sank.

Everything from the cinematography to special effects were phenomenal for a movie from the late 90's and it's still spot on today.

The fact that it has been remastered in 3D has made its release feel all the more in poor taste.I was all of six years old when Titanic first hit our screens. It was, of course, one of the biggest blockbusters of my childhood. So large was its impact, in fact, that on several occasions during my schooling I was subjected to Titanic-themed history and art projects, all of which involved watching the three-and-a-bit-hour behemoth as a primary piece of research. In the years since, it has become the nostalgia movie of choice among my friends. So I've seen it more times than I'd care to count. Seeing it remastered on the big screen, however, made its inadequacy as a historical film more laughably evident than ever.Given the policed divide between the haughty classes of the upper decks and the lowly paupers of steerage, and the shameful priority given to the wealthy when it came to filling the lifeboats, the Titanic tragedy has often been held up as a telling snapshot of the class politics of the time. Through the star-crossed, and completely fictional, love affair between penniless rogue Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and drippy debutante Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), Cameron attempts to explore the inherent tensions which the ship contained. This rendering, however, is reductive to say the least the gilded dining rooms of first class are populated by sarcastic, brandy-swilling poshos and the steerage is full of arm-wrestling Germanics and Guinness-guzzling Irishmen who are prone to punch one another or break into a fiddle recital at the slightest provocation. Probably the most coherent message about class we are given, as the two lovers move between their respective camps, is that it's much more fun to dance a jig below decks than it is to discuss oil prices over caviar.The stories that survived the ship's demise are a mix of startling inhumanity and incredible heroism. But Cameron's manipulative approach often robs his material of its inherent pathos and breeds drastic historical inaccuracies. In its turbulent second half, poignant moments come thick and fast, but many of them are either wholly fictional or shamelessly skewed for the sake of taking some cheap tugs at the heartstrings. The 'unsinkable' Molly Brown, who in the real tragedy insisted the half-full lifeboats return to collect those still stranded in the ice-cold water, is robbed of her triumphant moment and recast as a much less domineering symbol of feminine subordination. Similarly, as is widely known, the ship's string quartet played on top deck as the Titanic went down, in order to calm the passengers, but even this incredible part of the tale is soured by the schmaltz Cameron lays over the scene. As the quartet finish their rendition of 'Orpheus and Eurydice', one of the violinists turns to his fellow musicians and says, 'Gentleman, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight'. Such candy-coated moments continually deaden the impact of the film's rich source material.Cameron once quipped that he only agreed to make the film because a free deep sea dive to the Titanic wreck came as part of the package, suggesting this was never intended to be his magnum opus. Indeed, given the director's famous meticulousness, the film feels like he has been oddly careless in places. Kate Winslet's accent is allowed to wander between American, Irish and English with little consequence, and despite a rigorous casting process for the part of Rose's malevolent fianc√© Cal - which saw innumerable famous actors rejected - the appalling Billy Zane was selected, who ends up playing the role like a camp Count Dracula.Despite all this, the clunking one-liners, the dreadful acting and the cheesy artifice actually gives Titanic its distinctive charm. When watching the released film on the big screen, I was surprised to find that most of my fellow audience members were giggling along at all of the abysmal moments, which also had kept me returning to it over the years. For myself and others it seems, this film is more of a trip down 90s memory lane than it is an historically accurate snapshot of a turn-of-the-century tragedy. As such, criticising Titanic on the grounds of historical infidelity is tantamount to damning Top Gun for giving a rose-tinted portrayal of the lives of fighter pilots - doing so would be to miss the point of what makes these films so memorable.I completely agree with those who feel Titanic has no place in the proceedings for the centenary of the original tragedy.

Raise the Titanic, was loosely based off a novel by Clive Cussler. It is a race between the Americans and Russians trying to obtain a rare mineral that could decide who becomes the top world power. To do this, they must salvage the mineral from the Titanic. The only way to do this is by raising the Titanic; ergo the main titles. This may turn off people because the whole plot line is given away, but that shouldn't be something to squander over. It should be more of what is looked forward to. This film has a lot of good stuff in it.Starring as the main character of Cussler's stories, is Dirk Pitt, played by Richard Jordan. I can't say Jordan is the best choice but he's definitely not bad either. Jordan at least gives the character of Pitt some attitude that comes with the territory. For the most part, the entire film stays faithful to the paperback material. All the characters are in there, along with the most important scenes. One might say that this movie was thought to perform well because Alec Guinness, best known as Obi-Wan Kenobi, from Star Wars, plays a character as well in the story.On a side note, a particular element that could have been left out of story was the relationship between Gene and Dana Seagram. The same goes for the book but the way the situation was handled here was half-baked. From beginning to the midway point, there were various scenes that show strains on these two characters' marital status and then out of nowhere,...it stops. They get into an argument and Gene temporarily leaves Dana but the issue is never resolved. So why have it? It doesn't make sense to start something and not finish it. Adam Kennedy and Eric Hughes wrote the screenplay; so my question is, who skimmed over this part? Also some people may think the story drags but it all builds up to good ending.Besides this, there are multiple things to find enjoyable in this movie. First, the special effects. Of course it's 1980 special effects but none the less they are a sight to look at. From the submarines, to the Titanic itself, the props look really authentic. It's when the Titanic is brought to the surface that the view is beautiful. Although audiences may be annoyed to find out that the Titanic is in one piece. But what do you expect? The novel and this film where produced years before the Titanic was even discovered. It's fiction anyway, so why be so critical on accuracy when practically this whole film is inaccurate in real life?One of the most wondrous moments that takes place in this film is when Dirk Pitt enters the Titanic when it is above the water. It is truly a sight to behold and all this should do is make each of us just a little hungrier to see the Titanic for ourselves. It's plain epic. Another great aspect to Raise the Titanic is the soundtrack composed and conducted by music veteran John Barry. Barry puts in a lot of good tunes and has a gift for making the Titanic look awesome just for being on screen. His music is that moving and it's almost to the point of being angelic. For those who are skeptical, it's still at least worth a try to view.Except for a few issues dealing with the script, the film adaptation of Raise the Titanic is respectively a suitable tribute to the White Star Line cruise ship.

He is a very talented actor. Many of his character roles have been very convincing when they're need to be and is good at making laughs too. But what made him sign onto this project was beyond my comprehension. It's hard enough to accept that the story itself could be passed off as a cinema production, let alone this be a good movie. There was so much more director Paul W.S. Anderson could have done with this.Kurt Russell is Todd, a genetically altered human being, created to serve in the military. Todd is a muscular, silent, and deadly warrior. His skills are top notch and his killing is callous. He has no fear of anything. He is simply a human version of the T-800 endoskeleton from The Terminator (1984). That's cool stuff. However the character of Todd is another story. Todd is basically the equivalence of having a conversation with a rock. He has no social skills and his ability to communicate is through violence. That's not a fun character to watch when one is trying to understand them.But nothing lasts forever. Soon the people who bio-engineered Todd are able to create even more powerful human soldiers. It is to Todd's discretion that he is discharged and eliminated. What the higher command doesn't know is that Todd's not dead. And the planet that he was dumped on is now going to receive some unexpected help. Now it is up to Todd to protect a group of people from being annihilated and break them free from their universal prison. This is where he begins to gain the ability to be more human. But by the time this happens, the movie is dismally over. The reason the terminator is more amiable than Todd is how fast it is able to process information and become more human. Todd is not a computer and it takes him a long time to start being a likable character.The planet that these refugees hide in is dull. From background to front screen, everything is the same color; beige. Even the sky is beige. The ground is made up of a granular dirt and it's always windy. All this does is prevent the audience from having a clear image of what is going on in every scene, not to mention, everything is covered in sand. The plot lagged as well. This is supposed to be a sci-fi action film, not a drama. And that's all that kept getting pushed on me while I was watching this for more than half the time.It wasn't until the last few acts did I really enjoy this film. Why - because finally there was some action. The army that Todd once belonged to returns to the planet he was dropped into to exterminate the outcasts that he lived with. It's at this point that Russell finally puts those muscles to work, especially when it comes to that Gatling gun! It reminded me of Arnold Schwarzenegger too much but it was fun to remember. It's really cool how Todd was able to defy all odds and take on an entire army and come out with only a few scratches. However, this is all I can give it. The ending is nice too but in no way could I see Todd being anything but what he was brought up to be. Kurt Russell probably had fun but as for audiences go, the feeling may be the complete opposite. Nothing is new, fascinating or funny about this in general. The few action scenes are the only entertainment here.

His skills are top notch and his killing is callous. He has no fear of anything. He is simply a human version of the T-800 endoskeleton from The Terminator (1984). That's cool stuff. However the character of Todd is another story. Todd is basically the equivalence of having a conversation with a rock. He has no social skills and his ability to communicate is through violence. That's not a fun character to watch when one is trying to understand them.But nothing lasts forever. Soon the people who bio-engineered Todd are able to create even more powerful human soldiers. It is to Todd's discretion that he is discharged and eliminated. What the higher command doesn't know is that Todd's not dead. And the planet that he was dumped on is now going to receive some unexpected help. Now it is up to Todd to protect a group of people from being annihilated and break them free from their universal prison. This is where he begins to gain the ability to be more human. But by the time this happens, the movie is dismally over. The reason the terminator is more amiable than Todd is how fast it is able to process information and become more human. Todd is not a computer and it takes him a long time to start being a likable character.The planet that these refugees hide in is dull. From background to front screen, everything is the same color; beige. Even the sky is beige. The ground is made up of a granular dirt and it's always windy. All this does is prevent the audience from having a clear image of what is going on in every scene, not to mention, everything is covered in sand. The plot lagged as well. This is supposed to be a sci-fi action film, not a drama. And that's all that kept getting pushed on me while I was watching this for more than half the time.It wasn't until the last few acts did I really enjoy this film. Why - because finally there was some action. The army that Todd once belonged to returns to the planet he was dropped into to exterminate the outcasts that he lived with. It's at this point that Russell finally puts those muscles to work, especially when it comes to that Gatling gun! It reminded me of Arnold Schwarzenegger too much but it was fun to remember. It's really cool how Todd was able to defy all odds and take on an entire army and come out with only a few scratches. However, this is all I can give it. The ending is nice too but in no way could I see Todd being anything but what he was brought up to be. Kurt Russell probably had fun but as for audiences go, the feeling may be the complete opposite. Nothing is new, fascinating or funny about this in general. The few action scenes are the only entertainment here.

Bridget is just so normal, so common, like a real woman, and not like the perfect characters from Hollywood. She is emotional, she got a bad job, bad habits, like smoking and drinking too much, she got few extra pounds, she is not organized, she is delusional at times, she makes a fool out of herself, just like most women did at least once. I think every woman felt at least for a minute, a little like Bridget Jones, and felt relived to know that they are not alone. I simply love Ren√©e Zellweger, and she is perfect in this film, she made a very good job and I can't imagine a better perform of any other actress. It's hard to feel so many emotions watching a simple chick flick, but in this one, you laugh, you feel sorry for Bridget, you feel ashamed of the things she does at times, then you feel proud of her, and you can even cry with her, there is no way you won't love silly Bridget Jones.I'm a huge fan of both actors, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant, although I can't see both of them like very versatile actors. They seen to always have the same expression and performance, specially Hugh Grant. But they are great anyway and they have a very fun fight in this romantic comedy!This is a good film about what we want and what we really deserve, who we are and what people expect us to be. I can't point out any negatives points about this film, since its just the right measure of everything, comedy, romance. I love British chick flicks, way better than American!

One thing that did strike me watching it today was how rough the CG looked but I suppose a Blu-Ray special edition can probably fix that. Other than that, there is very little I would change as this remains a highly enjoyable sci-fi comedy that isn't afraid of laughing at itself although it laughs too hard at times.Tommy Lee Jones plays K, an undercover agent with a mysterious organisation that monitors all alien activity on Earth and, if necessary, cleaning up the mess. So when cocky NYPD officer James Edwards (Will Smith) encounters an alien on the streets of New York, K takes it upon himself to recruit Edwards into MiB. But once Edwards has become the black-suited J, their section chief Z (Rip Torn) has an assignment for them - a nasty bug in the ungainly form of redneck farmer Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio) has made his way to the Big Apple in order to wreck an intergalactic peace conference between warring species - a war that now has Earth in its sights.This isn't a movie to think about too much because all you'll find are plot holes. Instead, what you'll find is a damn good blockbuster with all the special effects, pyrotechnics and one-liners you'll need to satisfy most tastes. There's even a damsel in distress in the shapely form of Linda Fiorentino but what really makes Men In Black stand out is its tongue-in-cheek nature - when a screen showing known alien activity appears and one of the subjects is Sylvester Stallone, you know that taking this seriously simply isn't an option. Jones has rarely been as good as he is here, maintaining a humourless and unflappable face at the digital chaos around him. Smith provides most of the laughs, as you'd expect, and his interplay with Jones is also good. It's almost a shame that the CG swamps everything else although it is looking a touch dated in places. The short aliens with the coffee and the little green one inside the dying old man do look somewhat crude these days, no doubt something that the new film is happy to address.My only real issues with Men In Black are the all-too-short duration which crowbars the plot into place and which make the film feel rushed and the highly polished feel to the thing. Every scene, prop and line of dialogue feels sanitised as though director Barry Sonnenfeld went through about fifty takes of each shot until it felt right. MiB headquarters, for example, felt less like a busy hub of technical innovation and administration and more like a forgotten set from some Sixties sci-fi show. None of it felt genuine or real and suspension of belief was almost impossible. But as I said, that's what you get if you look at Men In Black from a critic's point of view instead of a ticket-purchasing member of the audience, which I was all those years ago. This is still worth taking a look at because in terms of entertainment, Men In Black does a perfectly good job and if nothing else, it is a humorous riposte to an all-too-often serious genre so if you're not bothered by the likes of The X Files or Millennium then give this a look.

I'd never really liked anime, but I gave it a shot anyway, because it looked interesting. Within in the first twenty minutes, I was hooked. The story takes place in an old-style Japan setting. It's about a young prince in a village called Ashitaka. One day he fights and kills a boar demon that was threatening to destroy his village, but in the process he is gravely wounded with a dangerous curse. The curse fills him with hatred; pain, a lust for violence, all this as it also slowly starts to kill him. Shunned by his village, he is forced to leave and search for a cure for the curse. He goes on a journey to the far-off mountains where the boar demon supposedly came from, hopeful for a solution to his problem. When he gets there, he discovers a town that is mining from the mountains and the surrounding forest, but they're slowly destroying the forest and all the creatures that live there. While staying in the village, it's attacked by a pack of wolves and a young girl called San, who lives with and was raised by the wolves. They're defending the forest and all the creatures that live in it, especially the magnificent forest spirit, which the villagers plan to kill in order to destroy the forest. Ashitaka decides to stop the villagers from killing the forest spirit because he knows the forest is sacred and beautiful, but he wants to avoid violence at all costs. Princess Mononoke has the title of being both the first anime film I ever saw, and also one of my favorite anime films of all time. The artwork and animation is gorgeous; the landscapes are beautiful and vast, the forests simply amazing, the characters excellently designed and the violent yet incredible battle scenes are drawn attentively, down to the last, tiny detail. For some anime movies or TV shows, I've noticed the English dub is poor compared to the original Japanese audio, but in this movie the English dub might even be better. The voices match the characters very well, even though they're speaking in American accents.The music is part of my main love for this movie. As a musician, I often listen more keenly than others to the background music for movies or TV shows. And I can say this movie has one of the best original scores I've ever heard. The music is oriental in style, as can be expected of an anime film, but the main thing I love about it is because it sounds so different to any other piece of music I've heard. With some American movies, the music is very dramatic and beautiful (think Lord Of The Rings), but it's still undeniably film music because it's predictable in parts. However, with Princess Mononoke, the music was unpredictable, but still brilliant, almost to the point of sounding like a piece of real classical music. The music suits every situation perfectly; it blends into the scenes so well that it almost seems to become part of that scene. In summary, Princess Mononoke is an absolutely brilliant movie, and one that should not be missed. I know that Spirited Away is considered the best of the Studio Ghibli films, but personally, I enjoyed Princess Mononoke more. It's darker, richer in music, artwork and is more adult than Spirited Away. It's one of the best animated films I've ever seen.

It starts out with a boy named Marty Mcfly. He is friends with a some what crazy scientist named emit brown, doc who invites Marty to go see his latest invention. It turned out to be a time machine in a Delorean. doc gets shot by some terrorists who doc tricked. Marty gets in the Delorean and drives for his life. when the car reaches 88 miles per hour he goes back to 1955. The people back then got freaked out when they saw him. he found his dad first, found out he was a peeping tom, then saves him from being hit by a car. That was a big mistake. he was awakened by his mom who was attracted to him. He finds doc from 1955. Thats when he realizes that his mom is in love with him instead of his dad. he must fix that while he finds out how to get back to 1985. he makes his dad develop courage and punch the bully who has bullied him for his entire life. then doc figures out that when lightning strikes the clock tower.

These people are all despicable, contemptible; you'll even have a hard time deciding who's the worst. Take for ex. the lead Mike Hammer who, under the credentials of a P.I. what truly does for a living is to extort married men, after putting them in a rough spot, shaking them down with the help of his girlfriend Velda&#x97;their regular seducer. But you could be confused at the beginning, as he performs what may be considered a good deed when, driving late at night, he picks up a woman in distress running on the road. She has just fled from a nearby institution, as his car's radio promptly informs him. Her name is Christine & she proves to be herself quite a piece of work. Anyway, their car trip ends when the car is stopped by strangers; Mike is knocked out and Christine is tortured to death--probably by non-anaesthetic dental surgery, suggested by the sight of her torturer with a pliers in his hand--as she seems to know some important secret she won't give up. Mike will spend the rest of the flick trying to unveil that secret and trying also to avenge her death, sometimes using violence and greatly enjoying it. Doing further research he meets some other despicable folks, including a woman, Lily Carver, who seems to have been Christine's roommate and who has also run into hiding, fearing for her life. But then she is revealed not to be that girl after all when the body of the real Lily is dragged out of the river. Finally this fake Lily gets her comeuppance, as all the other baddies, while Mike & Velda barely escape a miniature atomic explosion&#x97;or don't, depending the ending you rather see. The cast features also assorted goons, unscrupulous boxing managers, heavy weight mobsters and some law enforcers who have no respect for Mike or Velda. Amazingly enough, all these characters put together don't make for a single decent person, the only supposedly sympathetic ones being a couple of Greek mechanics; but the acting there is so bad and the characters so badly written--Nick being nothing but a walking stereotype--that we are never able to see these two as real men, just as clich√©s.Despite the unsavory characters, his is a quite entertaining film noir and one remarkable at that, for several reasons. First, the brooding, suspenseful, mood is kept from beginning to end, something that many others of the same genre failed to achieve--Scarlet St. and The Killing come to mind--and for once the disasters that befall the leads are not the makings of a woman. The plot is good enough to be interesting and the plot development tags along nicely, which conveniently allows us to forget that we don't give a hoot about these louses. The other remarkable thing about KDM is that, despite its brooding mood, it isn't by any means a dark, depressing flick; quite the contrary, this is one pretty exciting to watch. The acting is good also--except for the mentioned duo--especially from Rodgers. Her Lily Carver is so real she doesn't even seem to be playing a role, but showing her own self.But remarkable as KMD is, it also has serious flaws. The writing is mostly appropriate but also uninspired. There are no memorable lines, dialogs, here; no spoken words that keep ringing in our ears. Also the denouement is something of a let down, considering the scope of the case&#x97;theft of Uranium or something alike--which has even the Govt. involved. That ending should have had more participants I say, and a lot more hoopla. On the other hand the score goes a long way in creating the appropriate mood during some tense sequences. The cinematography is standard film noir. Most crucial scenes happen during the night--in fact most scenes--and there's good use of unusual camera angles and shadows, especially in scenes in staircases, corridors, exteriors in general. The torture scene is very effective, quite shocking, as we see nothing while hearing it all.Also I think this is the first time we see a formula successfully used many times later hero arrives in his sports car to the property of the villain, meets vamp acquaintance of villain which he promptly seduces; he even has time for a fight with villain's minions before meeting the man himself, then setting both their cards on the table amidst darkly humorous banter. A three-part sequence you'll see many times later in Bond flicks.Entertaining flick, but also one that displays a very cynical perspective on life.

And the tag-line (Jesus H. Christ, what a tag-line!) says it better than any summary No *#@!!* Navy's going to give some poor **!!@* kid eight years in the #@!* brig without me taking him out for the time of his *#@!!* life (needless to say that profanity is as ubiquitous as God in the Bible).The 'tag-line' kid is Larry Meadows, Randy Quaid as a young sailor who's going to serve 8 years in Portsmouth Naval Prison for having stolen money from a charity box belonging to the wife of a Superior officer, we easily get that the sentence would've been lighter for another 'victim'. Buddusky and Otis Young as Mulhall aka 'Mule' are assigned to escort him. They have one week on their hands and a poor psychologically unstable and (obviously) kleptomaniac 18-year old kid who never had any fun in his life, and is nowhere near having it. So that's The Last Detail in a nutshell, three men and a limited trajectory from Norfolk where the assignment was given to Portsmouth where the delivery would be done. Orders are limited in space and in time one week.One week before jail, like Edward Norton's last day before jail in Spike Lee's 25th Hour and with a lesser sense of urgency, this week might be Meadows's last opportunity to have his share of fun and to get the spirit 'in him'. Of course, this spirit is carried by Nicholson in a tailor-made role, only followed by Meadows because he's handcuffed and Mule because he's 'in the same boat'. Badass is the joker, Mule the straight-man and Meadows in the middle doesn't know how to fit. Randy Quaid delivers a remarkable performance as a poor vulnerable kid victim of circumstances and a perfect counterpart to Badass' exuberance and flamboyant personality. No wonder that Badass would try to teach him how to get mad at things or get them the way he wants. Both actors would be Oscar-nominated for their performances.That's what I love with these 70's films, they reflected the atmosphere of their era with a raw authenticity and gritty realism without distracting the viewers from the many purpose of being entertained or let's just say, spend a good time and learn one thing or two about a guy, a woman or a bunch of people. I can't think of a more humanistic period movie-wise than this 1967-1976 decade with The Last Detail as one of its highlights. You have three men who belong to the military side during probably the most anti-military era ever; they incarnate the very establishment they hate themselves, yet they remain faithful to a sort of moral code. They have fun within their own group, drink beer and bang whores, but rules still exist. And while we're transported by the poignant sight of the young Meadows haplessly skating on the ice rink, we know that sooner or later, we'll be reminded of that goddamn assignment.But one can't deny the impact a bigger-than-life personality like Buddusky would have on a submissive character like Meadows, while not being a character study a la Five Easy Pieces, we expect from Meadows' youthful naivety that the film would depict a coming-of-age, if only for the incredible bar scene that echoes Bobby Dupea's chicken salad moment, when Buddusky asks for a beer to the under-aged sailor. He protests not because it's unfair but because he thinks that a guy who had the hardest time of his life coming is adult enough to get some privileges. We accept this logic and feel for both Buddusky and Meadows. It's not in him says Mule, referring to this spirit Buddusky tries to inculcate, but the intelligence in the script is that whatever sickness stroke Meadows, we feel that the cure would be much worse.The script, written by Robert Towne, who'd win an Oscar for Chinatown one year later reflects the paradoxical approach to rules and authority during the post-Vietnam era, incarnated by the Navy trio, each one being more complex than what he seems at first. The script is also one of the film's strengths in the way it feels absolutely real and genuine, without any clich√©, and allows each of the character to shine and to make us feel for them or for the kind of persons they were, and the kind of cities they grew in, like the North East to which the film delivers a sober but no less appealing painting. In fact this film made in 1973 makes me wonder in 2042, when people will ask about the 2000-2010's, which movies I would recommend (if I'm still alive).Now that cinema traded its dignity for money, 3D, special effects and un-special stories, where have gone all the true authors eager to express their view of life, on the world?

The script is also one of the film's strengths in the way it feels absolutely real and genuine, without any clich√©, and allows each of the character to shine and to make us feel for them or for the kind of persons they were, and the kind of cities they grew in, like the North East to which the film delivers a sober but no less appealing painting. In fact this film made in 1973 makes me wonder in 2042, when people will ask about the 2000-2010's, which movies I would recommend (if I'm still alive).Now that cinema traded its dignity for money, 3D, special effects and un-special stories, where have gone all the true authors eager to express their view of life, on the world? Where have all the 'Hal Ashby's gone goddammit?

I just love it so much. It will always & forever be my favorite. I love the droids, Chewbacca, the evilness of Darth Vader, and the acting from the entire cast. Mark Hamill is always adorable as Luke, Harrison Ford is always hilarious & gorgeous as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher is perfection as Leia Organa & Anthony Daniels as C-3PO & Kenny Baker as R2D2.
