Renouncing Christianity, he pledges his soul to the Devil and is cursed to walk in limbo forever as an undead vampire. Four hundred years later he is meeting with Jonathan Harker, a London solicitor's clerk, when he sees a photograph of Harker's fiancée Mina, who looks the image of Elizabeth. He imprisons Harker in his castle and travels to London to woo Mina, but his vampire attacks draw the attention of the eminent Professor Van Helsing. Mina is seduced by the Count, but does not yet know his true identity, whilst Van Helsing and his friends are closing in.What to say about this movie ? It's brilliant - it's the work of an extraordinary director. It's visually sumptuous, extremely well made and one of the more faithful adaptations of an oft-filmed book, but it also takes far too many liberties with certain characters and story aspects, which can prove distracting. Let me take the good points first. Visually and aurally, this is a sheer delight from start to finish; it was all filmed on stages and the sets are just stupendous, as is the powerful bass-string score by Wojciech Kilar. The photography by Michael Ballhaus is simply stunning - every classic horror trick is used; up lighting, candles, reverses, extreme lenses, fake shadows, mattes, different speeds, iris pulls, partial dissolves, what have you. Almost every shot, particularly in the first three reels, has some brilliant effect going on - perhaps my favourite is the moment when the mysterious coachman quite literally picks up Harker. Equally creative are Eiko Ishioka's amazing costumes, which transcend time and place and push traditional garments just slightly over the edge into fantasy; Dracula's clothes alone are worth watching the movie for. Coppola manages to direct with seemingly wild abandon but never once is the story sacrificed for arty pretension. He also captures beautifully the feeling of the ages passing in Dracula's world, contrasting his medieval castle in Transylvania with modern London, full of new inventions and engineering marvels (wax-cylinder recorders, typewriters, the cinematography, etc). The cast throw themselves into their gallery of lunatics with admirable gusto, though slightly varying success. Oldman is terrific under several different complex makeup jobs and brings out the romantic melancholia of Dracula perfectly, but also his terrifying feral side. Hopkins lends gravitas to Van Helsing without too much hamming (though he does keep adding an unnecessary letter i to Dracula's name), and Grant and Waits give solid horror-movie stock-character performances. Ryder and Reeves, as the young lovers Jonathan and Mina, try their best and are very pretty people, but are a little out of depth. So what's the problem ? It's that over-inflated title. James V. Hart's script is good and he has carefully adapted the novel closely, but this movie is also greatly influenced by the many previous film versions (essentially it has the look of the 1922 F.W. Murnau \/ Max Schreck version and the heart of the 1931 Tod Browning \/ Bela Lugosi version) and invents some new mythology for itself, and as such it is not a definitive movie of Bram Stoker's great book. So for the record horror fans, where does it differ ? Well, for a start there's the middle-ages prologue, based on the legend of Vlad Tepes, which is good and bookends the story nicely, but is a bit fanciful. There are some important plot points not in the book (the business with the locket where Dracula sees Mina's image, Renfield's preceding Jonathan as an emissary to Transylvania) and a few key omissions; there are no rats in the coffins at Carfax Abbey when there should be thousands (this is done brilliantly in the 1979 Werner Herzog \/ Klaus Kinski version) and the mark Van Helsing puts on Mina's forehead with holy wafer symbolising her unclean spirit is significantly absent. Where this version goes completely loopy though is the relationship between Dracula and Mina - here they are star crossed, infatuated lovers, separated by the ages. In the book he sees her as just another one of his victims and she is revolted by him. Their lengthy courtship in London is completely fabricated, as is the finale within the chapel of Castle Dracula - in the book Jonathan and Quincey kill Dracula just as the sun is setting, and he fades into dust. I guess what irks me most about this version is the emphasis on romanticism - in Stoker's book, Dracula is a monster, a fiend, a selfish, greedy, vicious, horrific creature of the night, and his presence instills only dread horror. He is like that too in parts of this movie, but in the middle-section particularly he is also a bit of a soppy, flowery-shirted wet blanket. However, whilst the title may annoy me, in the end this is a great adaptation of Dracula and a fabulous horror movie.

Some adoring reviewers here have claimed this film has revealed the endless possibilities of cinema to them. I must then think that they haven't seen very many films in their lives, seeing as Moulin Rouge does nothing but pick 'n mix then regurgitate with an extra helping of gorgonzola from films and genres that have been seen, digested and assimilated many, many times before. Except the now-obligatory post-modern irony isn't even in this mish-mash, as the two leads - Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in particular - are so totally devoid of any ability to do irony, you'll end up with tooth decay at the end of this schmaltzy ride. Kidman and her button nose, which prevents her from looking anything but pretty but never beautiful (as this film would have us believe), is probably one of the most actory actresses working in Hollywood today. Her performances go through all the motions - see her Oscar-winning performance in The Hours, for instance, where she showed us what a mentally disturbed, brooding artist does, at least externally - without ever reaching anything resembling the SOUL of her character. In this sense, when comparing Julianne Moore's unforgettable performance to Kidman's in the same film, you understand in what ways she could also be viewed as unconvincing as the doomed courtesan Satine in Moulin Rouge. As for McGregor, who was supposed to be playing a young Londoner (with an awfully good Scottish accent for someone from so far South in the UK!), his Christian had a little more integrity, but way too much sap. Watching such a man declare his undying love to me would probably make me feel like the most unromantic, irreverent and callous woman in matters of love! The film itself, essentially an old-fashioned musical with no original songs and a few clever gimmicks to give it a superficial modern veneer, will probably date very quickly. Whoever will be watching it in, say, the year 2020 won't help noticing how turn-of-the-century it is. A film which uses popular culture references for a greater, more timeless purpose rather than being used BY them, will probably stand the test of time. Not so a film which does nothing but wink and nudge the spectator all the way through just to show how up-to-date with all the latest, late 90s, trendy pop references such as MTV-style cinematography, Bollywood movie aesthetics, Kylie Minogue and the naughty and Bohemian use of absinthe (which had a revival in the late 90s)... Even the big, turn-of-the-century New Year's bash... a direct reference to the MTV generation's own 1999. **SPOILERS AHEAD** One scene I found particularly ridiculous was the one in which the ruddy-cheeked, mustachioed Cockney (in Paris!) impresario Jim Broadbent (only superficially reprising his much more interesting role from Topsy Turvy), tells Nicole's Satine she's dying of consumption (tuberculosis for you and I). He does this as a last resort to convince her once and for all that she must give up her true love, the impoverished writer Christian and sleep with the evil Duke so that he'll sponsor the Moulin Rouge and her acting career. When Satine hears this shocking bit of news about her health, she reluctantly agrees to going along with her impresario's wish. I'll explain why I think this scene is ridiculous if anyone has ever known someone who's had to go through the unspeakable pain of discovering they have a terminal illness, they will know that Satine's reaction - agreeing to give up her love for Christian - is psychologically the least credible thing she could have done. Exactly because she knew she had so little to live, what really matters most in life would suddenly have come into sharp focus for her. She'd have wanted to spend her last period alive doing exactly what she had always wished for and what was really worthwhile - not pretending to love someone she despised in order to further someone else's business interests! As for her own business interests, what would they matter if she knew she was dying? **END OF SPOILERS** Speaking of the Duke and the way the evil, upper-class patron was portrayed in Moulin Rouge - he made the whole film so similar to Titanic in my eyes. Not unlike that other gargantuan cheese-platter, Moulin Rouge's poor were the generous, creative, lively, warm, vibrant salt-of-the-earth types to its cold, heartless, snobbish, evil rich. Moulin Rouge and Titanic portray class differences in a manner so simplistic, I wonder why more people didn't feel insulted by such an affront to their intelligence.Other majorly irritating elements about Moulin Rouge besides the... er... choice of music were some of the supporting characters, John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec in the front row. A lisping, simpering fool played by an actor of average stature unconvincingly walking on his knees.... It makes one balk just to think he was meant to portray one of France's legendary Belle Epoque artists, one whose artistic heritage embodies that time in the French capital like few others. Yet here he was, reduced to no more than a cutesy, Disney animal side-kick so he could be fed to the MTV generation without turning them off from the historic\/cultural baggage that would come with such a figure normally! My final words on Moulin Rouge are that if I'm going to watch a gaudy, noisy song-and-dance with funny characters talking in silly voices, give me the original Muppet Show series any day.

Some adoring reviewers here have claimed this film has revealed the endless possibilities of cinema to them. I must then think that they haven't seen very many films in their lives, seeing as Moulin Rouge does nothing but pick 'n mix then regurgitate with an extra helping of gorgonzola from films and genres that have been seen, digested and assimilated many, many times before. Except the now-obligatory post-modern irony isn't even in this mish-mash, as the two leads - Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in particular - are so totally devoid of any ability to do irony, you'll end up with tooth decay at the end of this schmaltzy ride. Kidman and her button nose, which prevents her from looking anything but pretty but never beautiful (as this film would have us believe), is probably one of the most actory actresses working in Hollywood today. Her performances go through all the motions - see her Oscar-winning performance in The Hours, for instance, where she showed us what a mentally disturbed, brooding artist does, at least externally - without ever reaching anything resembling the SOUL of her character. In this sense, when comparing Julianne Moore's unforgettable performance to Kidman's in the same film, you understand in what ways she could also be viewed as unconvincing as the doomed courtesan Satine in Moulin Rouge. As for McGregor, who was supposed to be playing a young Londoner (with an awfully good Scottish accent for someone from so far South in the UK!), his Christian had a little more integrity, but way too much sap. Watching such a man declare his undying love to me would probably make me feel like the most unromantic, irreverent and callous woman in matters of love! The film itself, essentially an old-fashioned musical with no original songs and a few clever gimmicks to give it a superficial modern veneer, will probably date very quickly. Whoever will be watching it in, say, the year 2020 won't help noticing how turn-of-the-century it is. A film which uses popular culture references for a greater, more timeless purpose rather than being used BY them, will probably stand the test of time. Not so a film which does nothing but wink and nudge the spectator all the way through just to show how up-to-date with all the latest, late 90s, trendy pop references such as MTV-style cinematography, Bollywood movie aesthetics, Kylie Minogue and the naughty and Bohemian use of absinthe (which had a revival in the late 90s)... Even the big, turn-of-the-century New Year's bash... a direct reference to the MTV generation's own 1999. **SPOILERS AHEAD** One scene I found particularly ridiculous was the one in which the ruddy-cheeked, mustachioed Cockney (in Paris!) impresario Jim Broadbent (only superficially reprising his much more interesting role from Topsy Turvy), tells Nicole's Satine she's dying of consumption (tuberculosis for you and I). He does this as a last resort to convince her once and for all that she must give up her true love, the impoverished writer Christian and sleep with the evil Duke so that he'll sponsor the Moulin Rouge and her acting career. When Satine hears this shocking bit of news about her health, she reluctantly agrees to going along with her impresario's wish. I'll explain why I think this scene is ridiculous if anyone has ever known someone who's had to go through the unspeakable pain of discovering they have a terminal illness, they will know that Satine's reaction - agreeing to give up her love for Christian - is psychologically the least credible thing she could have done.

You see the problem with futuristic films is that, if they jump onto a bandwagon and make short term predictions then they risk looking silly even after a few years. With Lawnmower Man it is likely that it was silly and poor the second it hit the cinemas, never mind how dated and unconvincing it looks over a decade later. I doesn't help that the CGI looks even more silly and OTT now but the effects are poor throughout and highlight how dangerous it is to base a movies appeal quite squarely on the appeal of special effects.

Fahey's rubbish Forest Gump impression is just as bad as his absurd transformation into evil master; he is unconvincing and when the script demands from him he simply gets hammy. Support is equally as average and nobody can do anything to stop the rot and you can see the film just become more interested in being an average sci-fi horror with a reliance on of the moment effects and themes.Overall, this may once have been topical enough to pass muster but a decade on the novelty is gone and all that is left is an average film with a poor plot, poor acting and laughable computer effects.

They should've edited to PG-13 though for more audience members!. I really do not think this author has really seen Judge Dredd, because the idea that this film could not pass the MPAA with a PG-13 certificate is one of the most telling signs that the censoring of film has gone too far in America. Indeed, this conception of Judge Dredd is so watered down you could almost cuddle up to it in your sleep. The sins of this film are numerous and heavy, but by far the worst is the attempt it makes to please everyone. That old saying about trying to please everybody and winding up pleasing nobody as a result was invented for a reason. Sadly, film executives once again misinterpreted this as a sign that our films need to be more censored and watered down in order to appeal to everyone. If only they could realise that the varying nature of individual taste means that there is never going to be a film that everyone in the world will pay to see twice.Not that the childishness of the film is limited to its marketing approach. In the big introduction of Dredd, we have Dredd getting off his motorcycle, stepping out in boots and armour that look far too big for him, and announcing to his fellow judges that the weapons being fired at him from some hundreds of metres above him have an effective range around a hundred metres too short to reach him. I don't know who put this doozy in the script, but I wish they had at least paid attention during a basic lesson on the principles of gravity. Bullets tend to stay effective when gravity is aiding them on their journey down. It is why so many have been killed by falling bullets when they fired their weapons upwards into open air. Mind you, this is by no means the worst blunder in the film, even if it is the most obvious.Exactly how Sylvester Stallone got his name attached to this project, I don't know, but this is probably the biggest of the mistakes. From what I have heard, Dredd never appears anywhere other than in this film without his mask, and he is a much larger specimen than Stallone to boot. Of course, the studio wanted to have a big-name star to sell this adaptation on the back of, but this results in the actor overwhelming the character. What little I knew of Dredd was definitely nowhere to be seen in this impersonation. Stallone simply recites a bit of exposition here, a few catchphrases there, and the rest is just sheer phoning in. Attempts to capture the hardened, flatlining personality of the Judge simply fall flat, and the support cast simply look lost. Max Von Sydow and Jürgen Prochnow look as if they are embarrassed to be there, and how much their asking fees contributed to the estimated ninety million dollar budget is something I can only guess at. Diane Lane, Joan Chen, and Balthazar Getty all do a good job of hiding how embarrassed or disappointed they are to be there, while Stallone simply looks oblivious to what a pile of garbage he has helped make.Director Danny Cannon has vowed to never make another film with a big name star, and it isn't difficult to see why. Apparently, Stallone had a big say in the final film, and the script was often subject to rewrites as the film was being shot. Now, while Stallone has penned some brilliant scripts in the past, this is not a Rocky film, and the requirements of the story or continuity were quite obviously beyond Stallone. Indeed, it is because of films like this one and Batman Forever that the reputation of comic book adaptations needed such a major rescue in the form of the X-Men films. Those films also proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that compared to casting a superstar whose acting range is, shall we say, a little limited, casting a relative unknown for a role that has specific characteristic requirements is a much safer bet.Judge Dredd is not even so bad it is good.

I sit through slasher movies like Friday the 13th and its ilk and it's all I can do to keep from falling asleep. I know what will happen An ax-wielding maniac will chase down and kill a scantily-clad girl. Big deal! Now The Changeling on the other hand, is very different. Instead of relying on cheap gimmicks, overbearing special effects, gore, nudity, swearing and knife-wielding maniacs, it relies on our primal fears to scare us. Our fear of the dark, claustrophobia and dread of the unknown are what make this film work. There is almost no blood, violence or swearing. There is nothing remotely sexual in this film, and yet I love watching it once a week.Of course George C. Scott, Trish Van Der Vere and Melvyn Douglas are great. I've always loved Scott, and though I've never seen Douglas in other movies, I thought he was great in his role. He played with great emotion.So if you want to be creeped out and not just shocked, rent The Changeling and watch it alone, in the dark and with the phone turned off.

The story is brilliant and the visuals amazing.I have seen the German 147 minutes version of the movie, without subtitles. Yes it's a long watch but it's worth every second of it. Basically only reason why the movie is so long is because they need about ten hand gestures to speak one sentence. It's kind of dreadful to look at first but once you're used to it, it shouldn't trouble you anymore.In many ways this movie can be regarded as the Blade Runner of the '20's. Metropolis is set in a futuristic world that has a same kind of atmosphere as in Blade Runner. The mix of '20's cars and propeller-planes with futuristic machines, highways, buildings and androids is very unusual but an absolutely awesome thing to look at. The movie was ahead of its time and in some ways also prophetic.The story is absolutely the best thing of the movie. Also the way the story is told and directed by Fritz Lang deserves credit. The story is tense and has quite some symbolism, layers and storyline's but remains always easy to follow. The ending is truly spectacular and tense. The way how spectacular and tense the ending and the entire movie in general was, really surprised me in a positive way.The sets are obviously fake and miniatures at times but they still manage to convince and impress. Further more the movie is filled with some fantastic and very convincing early special effects.Man who also deserves credit is Alfred Abel. Wow, what a great actor he was in this movie.An absolute must see and one of the best movies of all time.10\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"2 May 2005","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" This truly is a classic masterpiece and honestly one of the best movies ever made.

It isn't long however before they become equally well known there, as the Banditos Yanquis ...This is a well-made, entertaining and popular western, featuring a terrific performance by Newman, but is quite unusual in that it is a completely romantic, mythical, playful movie. It portrays its outlaw heroes as all-round good guys; thoughtful, good-natured and considerate, and the frontier as the traditional fun-loving mixture of cathouses, drunks and comedy sheriffs. Could this really have been made in 1969, the same year as Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, the ultimate myth-debunking, violent, sleazy, lawless, cruel, unforgiving depiction of the west ? William Goldman's script is witty and full of great characterisation, and reputedly he researched the real Butch and Sundance's histories exhaustively, but can anybody really buy this as a faithful western story after Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy completely redefined the genre ? That said however, this is an extremely enjoyable movie, thanks largely due to Newman's engaging mix of amiability and bad temper, and the fantastic big-wide-world photography by Conrad Hall, who won an Oscar. Redford is well cast as the Sundance Kid, quick with a gun but not so quick with his wits, constantly complaining about the trouble other people are getting him into, but he'll always be one of my least favourite actors. There are several justly very famous moments, such as the escape from the mountain-top, the freeze-frame ending, and best of all the scene where Newman and Ross ride a bicycle to the strains of Burt Bacharach's song Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head, sung by B.J. Thomas. A good movie, and a great western, but also a film out of time. Who are those guys !?
