There were times I had to force myself to detach from the magnetic pull of it's realism.The story line, characters and science is all done very well. It's tightly written, directed, etc. An incredible A+++ for computer animators. The actors who did the voices did an excellent job in bringing the animated characters to life. Although I recognized the actors by their voices they're performance was done so well that I didn't get distracted by it.Although I wasn't knocked out about the story (my personal opinion) then for me the movie went slower than a normal scifi\/action film.

Wonderful as it, being the third one in a very famous series and following its ''classic'' brothers, manages to entertain and has an intriguing quality to it as well. Maddening, in that it sometimes has awkward directorial flourishes and has flat scenes balanced with tremendously good ones that make you wonder if this could have been the best in the series. In my opinion, this is the second best in the seriesafter the original, which IS a masterpiece of the cinema and the most moody.  The alien is the most convincing in this entryThe fourth entries aliens didn't seem to movie in a lifelike manner and seemed blatantly CGI  and Weaver gives her best performance in the entire saga.

The third has the best cinematography in the movie some scenes are shot with this hellish-feeling amber hue that really gets the atmosphere across. The now-classic moment where the alien has Ripley against the wall in the infirmary and seems to nuzzle her is the most disturbing moment in the whole series because its reaction is not what we expect. David Finchers' take on the series is not what we expect either instead of a guns'n'action movie like the second, or a masterful scare-fest like the first, we get a somber, thoughtful entry that must have been a surprise to sometoo surprising in fact as the film was loathed upon release.

But that's not necessarily a good thing.Everything about Shyamalan's newest film, Signs, reeks of the master of suspense. The camera angles. The blocking. The muted acting. Even James Newton Howard's score (which is really just a ripoff of Psycho and Vertigo). Does this make it more compelling? Not really.Shyamalan grabbed America's attention with his 1999 debut, The Sixth Sense, a film which was praised for its creativity with the ghost story template, its return to the glory of the suspense genre, and its surprise ending. 2000's Unbreakable was not as well-liked as its predecessor, but I liked it more. I thought Shyamalan took what he learned from The Sixth Sense and expanded upon it, creating a film that was much more interesting visually and plot-wise. Many disagree with me. That's okay.Signs just doesn't live up to this. And it's because this simply isn't a story that lends itself well to the Shyamalan method of visual storytelling.Let's start with the setting. Shyamalan chose to play this story small-scale, choosing to show how a War of the Worlds-type scenario affects the common man. It's a bold move, one that should play out better than it does. In order for this to work properly, the actors have to have unbridled emotion, not muted tones. The tone has to be completely even, something which Shyamalan didn't accomplish here.The actors. Mel Gibson replaces Bruce Willis as Shyamalan's main horse. His emotional honesty seems like it ought to lend a credibility to Shyamalan's chosen plot. It certainly plays better than had Shyamalan gone with Willis, as Gibson has a certain world-weariness about his demeanor that the character needs. Does it work in the end? Not really. And part of that is because Shyamalan reins him into the same muted emotions from his previous films. Especially in a character that has such as a strong arc, with his struggle with his faith in religion and in humanity, Gibson doesn't sell the key moments.Joaquin Phoenix and Rory Culkin are both fine. They both show a grasp of the material and how to play it properly. Newcomer Abigail Breslin as young daughter Bo doesn't get it. Part of that is a weakness of the script. Shyamalan tries to inject a certain amount of humor at what ultimately prove to be untimely moments. Bo is Full House when the film should be X-Files. It just doesn't work. Odd, considering that Shyamalan has written such strong roles for children in his previous two films.I did like The State's Michael Showalter showing up in a cameo. I dig that guy.The cinematography works great. Fujimoto's choice of camera angles, showing key moments obscured, utilizing reflection, worked extremely well for the movie.

Night Shyamalan is officially the next Hitchcock. But that's not necessarily a good thing.Everything about Shyamalan's newest film, Signs, reeks of the master of suspense. The camera angles. The blocking. The muted acting. Even James Newton Howard's score (which is really just a ripoff of Psycho and Vertigo). Does this make it more compelling? Not really.Shyamalan grabbed America's attention with his 1999 debut, The Sixth Sense, a film which was praised for its creativity with the ghost story template, its return to the glory of the suspense genre, and its surprise ending. 2000's Unbreakable was not as well-liked as its predecessor, but I liked it more. I thought Shyamalan took what he learned from The Sixth Sense and expanded upon it, creating a film that was much more interesting visually and plot-wise. Many disagree with me. That's okay.Signs just doesn't live up to this. And it's because this simply isn't a story that lends itself well to the Shyamalan method of visual storytelling.Let's start with the setting. Shyamalan chose to play this story small-scale, choosing to show how a War of the Worlds-type scenario affects the common man. It's a bold move, one that should play out better than it does. In order for this to work properly, the actors have to have unbridled emotion, not muted tones. The tone has to be completely even, something which Shyamalan didn't accomplish here.The actors. Mel Gibson replaces Bruce Willis as Shyamalan's main horse. His emotional honesty seems like it ought to lend a credibility to Shyamalan's chosen plot. It certainly plays better than had Shyamalan gone with Willis, as Gibson has a certain world-weariness about his demeanor that the character needs. Does it work in the end? Not really. And part of that is because Shyamalan reins him into the same muted emotions from his previous films. Especially in a character that has such as a strong arc, with his struggle with his faith in religion and in humanity, Gibson doesn't sell the key moments.Joaquin Phoenix and Rory Culkin are both fine. They both show a grasp of the material and how to play it properly. Newcomer Abigail Breslin as young daughter Bo doesn't get it. Part of that is a weakness of the script. Shyamalan tries to inject a certain amount of humor at what ultimately prove to be untimely moments. Bo is Full House when the film should be X-Files. It just doesn't work. Odd, considering that Shyamalan has written such strong roles for children in his previous two films.I did like The State's Michael Showalter showing up in a cameo. I dig that guy.The cinematography works great. Fujimoto's choice of camera angles, showing key moments obscured, utilizing reflection, worked extremely well for the movie.

A movie that promises a Monster Mash results in a collection of Monster cameos.This is a semi remake of 'Son of Frankenstein', where broken-neck Ygor used the Monster to exact his revenge. This time around, it's mad scientist Karloff (with hunchback Naish) doing the same on those who imprisoned him. But the only 'monsters' used as his proxy for revenge are Dracula and Daniel. The Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster show up just long enough to do their snarls before being dispatched. A nice touch was the triangle love between Talbot, the gypsy Ilonka and Daniel. And like 'Ghost of Frankenstein', there's a difference of opinion on who should be the recipient of whose brain.But this movie is still fun, probably because it's based more on my nostalgic memories from the first time I saw it as a kid rather than my harsh adult perception.

Carradine's turn as Dracula is very good, but you can't help but wonder if only Lugosi had been allowed to reprise his most famous role.

The scenery is absolutely breath taking, the special effects are so well done that you don't even realize that there are special effects present.  This seems to be a trademark of Robert Zemeckis (case and point, Forrest Gump).  The acting is very good, although, there's only 2 real sources of acting in this film, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.  The rest of the cast was good, but their roles were very minor.  Tom Hanks pulls off another great performance, as usual.  You really can feel all of his emotions while he's stuck on the island.  Also, not many actors have changed their physical appearance like Tom Hanks did for this film, I truly applaud him for his work.  As much as I liked Russell Crow in Gladiator, I firmly believe that Tom Hanks deserved it more (although that would be his third Oscar).  Helen Hunt also pulls off a very nice performance.

The plot has been done before, what plot hasn't, but never in this way, that I know of. This isn't a typical movie made in the last few years. It actually makes you think about what's going to happen and how it's going to happen. I pride myself on my ability to pick up on what will happen in a movie within the first ten or fifteen minutes and it took me quite a bit longer to figure out what the heck they were doing with this film. If you want to see a good sci-fi flick this is the one for you. Overall I give it four cigars, on my scale of two to five.

Fortunately , this equally brilliant study of madness shot to number one in many countries film charts, proving that we DO like odd movies, provided that big Hollywood stars are in them. Bruce Willis plays James Cole, a prison inmate in a destroyed future. He has a recurring dream involving an airport, someone dying, and a woman whom he has never met. A virus has decimated virtually all of the Earth's human population, leaving us living in terrible squalor deep below the ground. One day\night, Cole is volunteered for an experiment, which involves him being sent back in time, to find information about where the plague came from. Sadly, the scientists send him back too far, and that's where things begin spiraling out of control... This is a poetic, sometimes ironically funny film that, despite the bleak subject matter, emerges as something highly enjoyable. Brad Pitt is an over the top delight as a man who may or may not be responsible for the desolate future, whilst Madeline Stowe and Willis both deliver delightfully subtle performances. It looks great as well, veering between Gothic nightmare and crowded city streets. The music is great, veering as wildly as the plot itself. However, i don't like this as much as Brazil, for one reasonIt's not original enough. We've seen the time travel, horrible future scenario before, it doesn't impact like it should. But that's a minor quibble. As a whole, this is one of the most accomplished, scary and dark films i have yet to see. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for reading.
