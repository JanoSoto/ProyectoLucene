For how could a mere thousand words adequately express the thoughts and feelings generated by sitting through two hours of watching a Lennon or McCartney, a Dion or a Jackson gradually taking hold of her God-given talents and rising to super-stardom only to have it cut short by what must be one of the most vile acts of murder the planet has ever witnessed. What if the first few hit singles or the first couple of albums of ABBA were all we ever got to hear because Agnetha or Frida was murdered at that point? It even goes so far as to make you wonder about the Beatles, even Bach, Mozart, or Beethoven.I admit I was a bit nervous when I rented the movie because I was worried that a sub-standard job may have been done to capture the short life of this young woman. Her music was really just the outcome of her virtuous self and the incredible qualities of courage, a genuine love for humanity, and a deep-seated patience that she obviously clung to. For, as the film points out, a Mexican-American singer is not easily accepted by Americans nor by the Mexicans. Selena also had to work at brining about unity among her family such as with her father's acceptance of her marriage. Needless to say, the film did not disappoint me in the least, for it portrayed this truth with class.Fortunately, the film did not sugar-coat the characters, as many biographical movies do - it confidently revealed the mistakes and some undesirable traits in the people it portrayed. In fact, the characters were so real, I forgot several times that I was watching a movie and thought I was sitting with these people laughing with them and sharing in their joy and in their pain. Jennifer Lopez was absolutely outstanding. There was so much depth, richness, and naturalness in her acting.I recognise also that it must have been very difficult for the actress who played Yolanda (manager of Selena's fan club and her murderer). To play the villain in order to help raise awareness of the life of a fabulous soul would be very difficult indeed.The beautiful candle-light vigils shown at the end of the film made me regret very much having not lived in Texas and been part of them at the time. I especially appreciated the fact that the film did not make Selena's death its focal point. It was much more of a celebration of the contribution she made in brining joy to the hearts of an unhappy world. This was its focus, even though Selena's death gave me a very sharp sting and made me cry. It is so sad but it cheers me that this film was made and that such a superb job was done on it.

Some agree with this as well, while others don't. Let me try to explain.As a musician, I would compare the plot of a literary creation to the form of a musical composition. In both cases they serve a skeletal function. They are not necessarily what the work of art is about. But they should be as solid as the piers and girders of a large building should be. Their existence is a matter of workmanship. A building deficient in its structural components is not one I want to inhabit. It surely will not stand long. And if it is my building, I would be ashamed to have been duped into purchasing it. This aspect is just as necessary in any major artistic creation, whether an extended musical composition or any full-length, big-budget film. In the latter case, it is particularly inexcusable to heap latterly so much expense and expertise of one sort onto a foundation which one can see beforehand is so lacking in expertise of another.This goes double for science fiction movies. Good science fiction is not about the science. It is about the changeless in human nature; and the environment greatly differing from our own which the scientific knowledge envisions is meant to point that up. But this is not to say that it works when the science, or the other aspects of the plot, are sloppy or implausible.In Lost in Space we have not only the most dabbling and dilettantish excuse for science, but such meager script-writing and characterization that one can't like even the characters one is meant or inclined to like. I seem to have a pretty low threshold for acting, not tending to notice mediocre acting unless it's *really* bad. But in this film my disbelief was suspended repeatedly by the vacuity of the acting-- although in the cast's defence it must be remembered that they had very little to work with.For instance Will resorts to the extreme measure of holographics to aid his presumably beloved robot threatened in battle. He nevertheless fails to save it. The only response we see to this loss is a quick Goodbye, Robot, a line delivered with about as much emotion as if it were spoken to someone who would return in an hour. One doesn't know whom to blame-- and I always want to give a child actor the benefit of the doubt. He might not have been allowed time for so much as a quiver in his voice. He certainly didn't have much dialogue to work with.It is his sister Penny, however, who has really developed the blase and casually outre to a fine art. How old is she supposed to be, anyway? She looks about twelve, acts like twelve-going- on-thirty, but has the bust of a Mae West-- as well as the hairstyle of some other species. It is not surprising that the alien monkey-girl takes to her so well. There is a distinct resemblance.William Hurt is an actor whom I respect, but his understated, subtle style was quite lost here, where there is nothing to be subtle about. Unfortunately, he usually came off as formulaic as everyone else.So this is the future. Earth threatens to stop sustaining human life.

The lack of chemistry between Nicolas Cage and Catherine Keener was enough to make the screening room chuckle during supposed intense scenes in this picture.  8mm just felt as if it never got going, every turn was as predictable as a dull Batman movie. I was able to enjoy a great performance from Joaquin Phoenix, maybe they should have cast him as the wife, hey it would have been more believable than Ms. Keener. In memory of Gene Siskel.

He is having an affair with his best friend's wife, Amanda. His best friend, Earl, knows about this, however. Thus he kills himself one day, and cleverly frames Clay for the murder. Clay, feeling both afraid and awkward, covers this incident up by making the death look like a suicide. The police fall for it and Clay puts this mess behind him.   This film, both written and directed by newcomer David Dobkin, is the most original movie I have seen in a long while. Think about it, we haven't had a movie this clever and blackly comic since Fargo, possible one of the best movies I have ever scene. The characters are so unique, while they don't generate much sympathy from the audience; they still are extremely fun to watch.The performances are another great element in the movie. Vince Vaughn portrays Lester Long like he did in the recent Psycho remake. His style, giggle, attitude, and presence are all priceless. Joaquin Phoenix takes us though a funny joyride as he gets into more and more trouble as Clay. Let's not forget Georgina Cates, as the slutty wife of Earl. She plays cocky character who everyone loves to hate. The only character I could find is Janeane Garofalo's, who was surly inspired by Frances MacDormand from Fargo.The film's soundtrack is of the best there is, with songs that not only further the character's motives, but are also catchy and even describe some of the movie's plot at times. I have owned the soundtrack even before I saw the movie, which is quite unusual. But once I heard the theme song to Clay Pigeons The Ballad of Lester Long, I had to get it.I do think that this movie could have been better, however. If it had left a few more elements to the imagination, like the guilt or innocence of Clay Birdwell, and the explicit murder and sex scenes, maybe the viewer would be l bit more involved into the story. A little less plot and a little fewer characters would have also been nice.But those are but minor complaints.

Mixing the disaster and standard shoot 'em up genres are aptly deployed to create a decent thriller.  Also, the concept of using mother nature as an adversary along with the standard villains is a riveting change of pace as well.  This addition of mother nature as a formidable obstacle, manifested in the shape of a violent deluge, adds noteworthy suspense to a typical action flick. The thrill to the minute jet-ski chases are breathtaking, and the action in HARD RAIN moves at an adrenalin rush with nicely photographed moments of excitement. HARD RAIN is a satisfactory crafted movie with a good cast and some marvelously engaging action sequences.HARD RAIN does not quite surface even with a promising concept. The most evincing frailty with HARD RAIN is that this film could have been a better movie.  The basis for this movie is terrific, but the product of this film, even with all the apparently right ingredients concocted is not on the money. For one, the performances in HARD RAIN were unbelievable.  Morgan Freeman lacked both a cunning and sinister personality as the antagonist. Christian Slater is alright as the protagonist for this water logged tale, but many of the decisions he makes seem far fetched.  His failed wisecracks are also out of place! Randy Quaid's mood swings as the psychotic Sheriff were just as unpredictable as the film's abrupt turn of events. Minnie Driver had a memorable role as a tough, yet sweet-natured partner for Slater. To be fair, the performances were not dynamic, but passable.  The special effects though, of course steal the show!The theme about greediness and obsession for the $3 million dollars is an interesting subtext in HARD RAIN. By the climax of this movie, when everybody involved in the shoot-out becomes ravenous for the elusive money, the dilemma submerges into deep water. HARD RAIN just wanted to show that money fuels inhibitions and corrupts otherwise intrinsically good people into selfish, cruel savages. Even the heroes can in turn succumb to their dark desires...As a whole, HARD RAIN had potential and should have done better. The special effects are incredible, yet some of the cliffhangers in this film appear to be both implausible and unconvincing. The characters in this film, though sympathetic, are improbable and sometimes inept in their proper roles.HARD RAIN was not rubbish, but too many fallacies hurt an almost spectacular water show. A fun film to watch, perhaps.  Briskly directed, definitely. Entertaining and visually unforgettable, yes. Enjoyable with magnificently stylized choreography, maybe. Worthwhile, innovative and prepossessing...no. Sorry, try again. RATING ** out of ****.
