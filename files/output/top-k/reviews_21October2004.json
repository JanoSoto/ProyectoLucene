I must say, it's great. The plot is great, and the way it's told is amazing. The story is first summed up in a matter of minutes, about 15, to be more accurate, and then the rest of the film has characters telling the story through flashbacks and retelling. We hear just about every opinion about Charles Foster Kane, apart from his own. The story is told after his death, and we see everything important that leads up to it, and only in the very end do we understand him, only then do we fully understand who he was, and what made him so. The ending also reveals one of the very most important things in any man or woman... one thing that everyone needs and knows of. I won't reveal it here, as it would almost be a crime to spoil the experience of this film to anyone. The acting is excellent; Welles himself is stellar as Kane, and his impressive appearance, along with his commanding voice, makes the character a forceful sight, nay, experience. The characters are well-written and credible. The character of Kane is probably the most well-rounded and perfectly built up I've seen in a movie, ever. The cinematography is excellent... the editing is great. I can't praise the angles, pans, zooms and transitions enough... it just has to be experienced. Now, for the one thing I can criticize in the film; the pacing. It's only two hours long, but it feels like much, much more. There were portions of the film where it felt like it didn't move at all. When there weren't great dialog or something equally as good in the film, it dragged terribly. There were too many scenes where the dialog seemed pointless, as well, I think. It didn't seem to be leading to anything. However, this criticism is so minor, due to the ending more than making up for it, that I still give this film a perfect score. I can't do anything but agree with its placing at the top of the top #250 films of all time, here on IMDb. As I'm writing this, it's #11. That's pretty much what it deserves, in my opinion. Not higher, not lower. Not the greatest film of all time(that pretty much still belongs to The Godfather, I think... at least, I haven't seen a better film than that, yet), but definitely far up there. I recommend this to any fan of film in general, and anyone who thinks they can understand it; it has a truly profound point that any man(and woman) should know of(preferably through seeing the film for themselves). Don't let the fact that it's old and black & white deter you from seeing this masterpiece.

This is the more action-like Hannibal Lecter film(whereas 'Silence' is the psychological, and Red Dragon is the half-cooked thriller-wannabe), as there is plenty of shooting, chasing and a fair bit of killing in the movie. Ridley Scott makes very good use of slow-motion shots, and utilizes quick cuts and some intense editing to keep shootouts and chases (somewhat) exciting and (occasionally) interesting. The plot is pretty good, but it just seems a little like it was just written to give the Hannibal Lecter fanatics a chance to see the good doctor in action, rather than tell an important story about him. The pacing isn't particularly good, and the film can be almost unbearable on repeated viewings. The acting is good, Hopkins is great, as always, and Julianne Moore is surprisingly good as Jodie Fosters replacement in the role of Clarice Starling. Both Ray Liotta and Gary Oldman are great as well, but that's too be expected from them. It was nice to see Liotta play a character so far away from the gangster-types he usually portrays. Oldman's character reminded me of his character from The Fifth Element; something in the way he talks, I think. The characters are well-written, credible and diverse. The effects are great; how they turned Oldman's face into that disgusting skin-less... mass... great. Ridley Scott understands horror(as evidenced quite clearly in one of his first films, Alien), and he scares the audience pretty good, through gory scenes, where only a few of them are overdone(the bowels out sequence was a little ridiculous... how did he cut through all that clothes with one quick cut from the knife?). The dialog is mostly well-written. Any fan of Hannibal Lecter will enjoy most of what he says, does and pretty much all of the scenes that even hints at him. All in all, a decent enough film, but too poorly paced and very little of interest to anyone not interested in Lecter, or who's not a very big fan of any of the actors. I recommend it to big fans of Ridley Scott and any of the main actors, and any fan of Hannibal Lecter.

Surprisingly enough; when I saw it as a kid I thought of it only as an adventure movie, but when I see it as an adult it comes of more as a serious war-picture, because despite the light comedy of David Niven (in one of his most memorable roles) this is a brutal picture, at times almost hard to swallow.(MILD SPOILER, not regarding the ending)The Germans come of quite sympathetic, especially compared to the heroes after they assassinate the films true victim-of-war because the person (with a background as a school-teacher) buckled under torture. When you have seen the scene you might say there was no other way, I say they could have used the same way on this person as they did to some Germans they tied up and gagged earlier in the film. When the people we are supposed to root for executes this person in cold blood it puts a damper on the rest of the movie. Sure, war IS Hell, and tough choices like this works in a number of movies, but here it is almost too much, and hits you straight in the face like a wet towel, at least in the manner it is told.On top of this scene, Gregory Peck - the most sympathetic guy in Hollywood - even comes off as almost unsympathetic at times! At one key moment in the film Niven has had it and yells to hell with the job! I've been on a hundred jobs and not one of them has altered the course of the war!

These feelings should hit close to home with most audience-members, as they have rarely been put in a life-or-death situation where you have to put all human emotions aside like Peck demands of his men. So when Niven later in the film actually apologizes to Peck for not being the cold-blooded killer he apparently wants him to be, it just feels entirely wrong!

It sure has a well-constructed story and director J. Lee Thompson never looses sight of the characters amidst all the first-rate action-scenes. Personally however, I still rank it behind another Alistair MacLean-based film Where Eagles Dare.That said, The Guns of Navarone is and will always remain one of the greatest examples of it's genre. Surprisingly enough; when I saw it as a kid I thought of it only as an adventure movie, but when I see it as an adult it comes of more as a serious war-picture, because despite the light comedy of David Niven (in one of his most memorable roles) this is a brutal picture, at times almost hard to swallow.(MILD SPOILER, not regarding the ending)The Germans come of quite sympathetic, especially compared to the heroes after they assassinate the films true victim-of-war because the person (with a background as a school-teacher) buckled under torture. When you have seen the scene you might say there was no other way, I say they could have used the same way on this person as they did to some Germans they tied up and gagged earlier in the film. When the people we are supposed to root for executes this person in cold blood it puts a damper on the rest of the movie. Sure, war IS Hell, and tough choices like this works in a number of movies, but here it is almost too much, and hits you straight in the face like a wet towel, at least in the manner it is told.On top of this scene, Gregory Peck - the most sympathetic guy in Hollywood - even comes off as almost unsympathetic at times! At one key moment in the film Niven has had it and yells to hell with the job! I've been on a hundred jobs and not one of them has altered the course of the war! I don't care about the war anymore, I care about Roy! These feelings should hit close to home with most audience-members, as they have rarely been put in a life-or-death situation where you have to put all human emotions aside like Peck demands of his men. So when Niven later in the film actually apologizes to Peck for not being the cold-blooded killer he apparently wants him to be, it just feels entirely wrong! You should have told him to shove it where the sun don't shine, David.(END OF SPOILER)These points adds somewhat of a damper on an otherwise solid picture I really loved as a kid, but find harder to truly enjoy as I grow older.

It fails almost completely. Nancy Walker may have seem a weird choice for the director but she had directed some TV shows and she was very comfortable with gay men (for instance, her and Montgomery Clift were the best of friends). The studio obviously wanted a director who would be comfortable with the gay subtext AND keep it PG! Well...she DID try!It all starts out great with Guttenberg skating around NYC, a good song on the soundtrack and nice use of multi-screens. Then it quickly falls apart. The dialogue is truly atrocious (the actors deserve credit for saying their lines with a straight face); there are the horrendous 70s styles and fashions; dreadfully unfunny comedy; trying to sell the Village People as a straight group--come ON!; Felipe's bird call gets annoying after EIGHT renditions and totally unneeded romance between Perrine and Bruce Jenner! Also WAY too long (2 hours). However there ARE some good things about this.The songs aren't bad and the production numbers are certainly elaborate; there's a nice sequence with Perrine recruiting 3 of the Village People; a beautiful rendition of Danny Boy; a truly hysterical song and dance number about MILK!!!!; and the YMCA number. It comes in too late (over an hour in) but it's just great--full of action, hunky men and frequent glimpses of full frontal male nudity! Also female (Perrine in the whirl pool). The acting wavers Guttenberg is WAY too hyper--I kept wanting to throw a few Valium in his mouth. Poor Valerie Perrine! She went from Lenny to THIS??? She's a wonderful actress and certainly beautiful and she REALLY tries--but the script is terrible. Bruce Jenner--don't get me started. Just one word comes to mind--hopeless. Tammy Grimes and June Havoc overact and underact and are just horrid. Worst of all is Marilyn Sokol as Lulu--she looks like Tim Curry from The Rocky Horror Picture Show and is truly astounding (I mean that in a bad way). You just watch her attempts at acting and comedy in utter disbelief.The main problem with this movie is they tried to whitewash the Village People. They were a big GAY group--that's totally ignored here. There IS a big gay subtext though. However by the time this movie came out, the Village People were old news and disco was dead. And the script needed a serious rewrite. Some people think this so bad that it's good. Production numbers aside I was bored silly with an occasional stupid line or performance to pick me up.

Hanks plays a prison guard presiding over a death row commission who initially performs his duties as an officer and has few compunctions about his role in terminating convicted death row mates. That is, until the day a miracle and a leviathon of a man by the name of John Coffey enters the prison for unknown circumstances and enters Hanks' stream of consciousness as well as his responsibilities. Coffey isn't like any other hostile prisoner Edgecomb (Hanks) has ever seen or known, for he has phenomenal, miraculous abilities, and completely reforms the prison for the lighter and the better for both the guards and the inmates, and provides the ultimate wonder and importance to the story miracles can happen in the most unlikeliest of places and affect everybody and everything, in this case, the penitentiary where Coffey is (wrongfully) confined as well as the unjust, ignorant prison system which rendered him a death sentence for a brutal, heinous murder. The acting throughout the film is nothing short of passionate, human, and touching Michael Jeter is superbly human and engaging as Del, and Michael Clarke Duncan is amazingly genuine as John Coffey, both actors clearly outshining the low-key Tom Hanks in an absolute rarity wherever Hanks is concerned. The atmosphere given, is ultimately sorrowful and depressing, and is scarcely uplifting in its somber tone, yet it is much, much more substantial than a random tearjerker the audience actually feels the characters and the scenarios which befall them, and it's not simply the women who will be emotionally affected, but I defy anyone who watches, in particular, the scenes of the executions, and not shed a single tear in grief and sorrow. It is curious and perhaps deceptive for the film to not reveal the nature of the inmates' sentences of course, then again we would like to assume a character as genial and benign as Del is as he is portrayed, rather than being a deranged, ruthless killer or whatever his action for ending up on death row, might detract of him. There are many curious symbols in the film which are delightful and relevant to the film's theme the mouse (Mr. Jingles) provides hope and inspiration to the imprisoned men and eventually to Edgecomb himself, the arrogant, beleaguering Percy is clearly a corrupt and unworthy possessor of undeserved power and authority, and Coffey (including his mystifying touches) is the miracle of the story, providing relief, resilience, and recovery to a problematic system and the troubled nature of life. The film succeeds with passionately and humanly in its direction (the director behind The Shawshank Redemption has been robbed too many times from acclamation), acting (practically every character shines and contributes enormous wealth to the story and the film), and screenplay (some of the most heartfelt and memorable exchanges in film history include, I tried to take it back, Boss (Coffey) and I just can't see God putting a gift like that in the hands of a man who would kill a child (Edgecomb)... timeless. The Green Mile ranks as one of the most effective, genuine, and wonderful experiences you'll ever be rewarded in film, especially in today's perfunctory approach to the human spirit and emotion running rampant throughout Hollywood, where such concentration is plenty appreciated in this excellent film. **** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"21 October 2004","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** The Green Mile delves into the world of the human soul and powerful emotion more than practically any film I have yet to see, and it works brilliantly as a somber, delightful, bewildering, and lamentable study of the discovery of the human spirit through human connection.

BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is more along the lines of real fear as it lets the imagination do most of it. The point I'm trying to make is that real fear isn't about seeing some guy in a mask chasing people with a knife followed by gallons of fake blood, no, it's what you don't know or see that will really freak you.
