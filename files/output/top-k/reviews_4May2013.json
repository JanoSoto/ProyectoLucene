Having the advantage of having seen it at all ages I can truly say that it has enough fantasy and whimsy and spectacle to keep the interest of children without being inane so that adults cannot appreciate it too. I think in all of filmdom only Walt Disney in Walt's time with his animated features and Pixar in modern times have been able to strike that balance. Even Star Wars has lost a step or two in the 36 years since its release.Wizard of Oz has the universal themes of the value of friendship and family, of how many of us have strengths and virtues inside of us we'll never believe we have until tested, and how many powerful people are literally all hot air. Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain is practically a slogan of American politics as I am writing this in the year 2013. Then there is beautiful Judy Garland when her exterior still matched her voice, before the studio system chewed her up and literally spit her out. She was never more lovely than she is right here. You'd never believe Billie Burke as the good witch Glenda is 55 years old. You'd never believe that Margaret Hamilton as The Bad Witch is only 37. I remember seeing her on a daytime commercial in the 1960's as a child and thinking Isn't she dead yet? There is maybe one aspect of this film that is uniquely pre-WWII. The theme of the film - Never look for anything if you can't find it in your own backyard is a motto for the isolationist years between the wars that would be left behind in only a couple of years when it became apparent that the U.S. would have to confront the evil expansionist powers growing on both sides of the globe. It is perhaps a unique snapshot in time in that regard only. It also shows the best the studio system could produce in that fabled year of 1939 when it was at the height of its power.Forgive me for yammering on about a film that has been reviewed hundreds of times, but this one will always have a special place in my heart and my memory.

However, if the point was to depict the chaotic life of people living on the streets and how they supposedly don't behave rationally, this movie succeeded in that goal.The movie is defined as comedy\/drama\/romance. There were a few funny things I laughed, I admit, but not nearly enough to warrant a comedy definition. Mostly the movie was drama and romance. The drama was OK, all the characters had problems with life and so on and they tried to cope with the difficult and unfair situations they encountered themselves in. The romance part...well, not my thing here. I guess the movie tried to be provocative and probably was back in 1985 when it was first released but now it was just a bit silly. There was this dangerous love element in it and it just didn't work out. The script was no good and the actors quite stiff.Also, the sounds were horrible.

As it is, the film is an eerie cocksure mess of a picture; a film embracing the idea of women selling one's body as an appropriate career and a film on the side of women treading the grounds of a Las Vegas stage in order to demean their gender. This is, of course, after providing us with a heartless tract on pro-plastic surgery wherein falsity and such are the answers to life and that you're yet to make it in life should you not be donning the bright, sexy, exotic turf of a Nevada stage. This is one of those awkward projects wherein which the film is rubbish, and we know it's rubbish, but the film in question DOESN'T.The film is about the entry to; the living in, as well as the consequent dominating of, a very specific realm within the American city of Las Vegas perpetrated by a woman named Nomi (Berkley) who's in her twenties. Looking to hitch a ride with just about anyone at the film's outset, the film makes a point to capture just how naïve she is at when the guy with whom she journeys swipes her belongings and drives off again. You have to wonder what he thought was in there for him - maybe he thought the case was worth something. Prior to all this, they cruise into town and lay eyes on Vegas for the first time There she is (!) utters the driver, insinuating a general feeling of awe at the lights and at what Vegas conveys. The city is practically glowing, radiating there in the night as this green-horn rumbles on in for the first time looking to make it in the world of dancing and entertainment. The fact Nomi is too trusting of the gentleman, and that she loses at a game of slots in a casino at this very early time in her tenure here, cements her status as being completely out of her depth.Cut to six weeks later, and Nomi is staying with a friend whom she has met in Molly (Ravera). Backstage at a Vegas show, Nomi falls in love with her surroundings; surroundings of which have already fallen in love with that of Cristal Connors (Gershon), the establishment's star showgirl whose changing room is set away from the general chaos of other's and can muster up very little emotion when offered a bouquet of flowers for a latest performance. Such is, one feels, the quantity of past offerings of this ilk born out of this on-going adulation that this reaction is induced. It is here Nomi truly desires to be, it is here Cristal truly desires to stay there can only be one true showgirl and when they get off on a somewhat negative first foot, battle commences.The film is essentially a string of second unit dance routines wherein very little is on but an awful lot is on show. Ultimately, this does little to raise the film above the level of usual American blockbuster fare - tits and arse are merely standing in for explosions and stunts. There are a number of scenes set at a pole dancing club owned by Al Torres, a slimy character played by Robert Davi &#x96; the very place at which Nomi must work if she is to hone her trade and get anywhere near places such as where Connors resides as queen of the stage. It's no secret the film enjoys these scenes, so much so that instead of actually probing as to why it is women might do this sort of work, or desire to be a superstar within these fields in the first place, we are instead invited to watch on; to join the punters and leer. A measure of how all over the place the film truly is lies in one specific sequence, wherein Davi's character briefly re-enters the heroine's life to stop and say hello for a minute. The guy was always a creep, and she was happy to be rid of him; but the romanticised tone as he once again re-enters the frame would suggest he's not all that bad, and that we should ourselves have missed him. I don't think so. Another odd moment arrives during a selection process sequence, when a male individual has for him a row of potential female dancers lined up for them so that he may cast his eye across and deduce whether they're fit for what the job demands &#x96; a sort of eerie syncing up with, one assumes, how the likes of Berkley and Gershon landed the roles of Nomi and Connors in the first place.The difference is that within the diegetic world of the film, a creep is at the helm of the project. Whereas one can lay little blame at the door of Paul Verhoven - someone whose female characters in Total Recall and Basic Instinct have been fun; feisty and often sexually charged without requiring the presence of rotten exploitation. The fallacy seems to fall with the fact those films depicted men first and foremost, with the dangerous women in their lives causing a chaos and such at the worst of times. Showgirls is, in a sense, constructed as if a 'men's picture'; a tale of two people vying for supremacy within a domain that pours lavish upon the dominant force and shoves the others to the back. Where Aronofsky's 2011 piece Black Swan nailed the case study, Showgirls just ends up being what it is an overly long chore stuck between being a contemplative mediation and a skin flick, a film which depicts women whilst systematically striking us as not knowing the first thing about them.

This world\/sun is Bellus, but before that happens, another planet, Zyra, will pass close by earth. This near-collision will result in earthquakes and tsunamis.Dave Randall (Richard Derr), a rogue and pilot, is paid to take the secret information of earth's doom to London, to scientists that are going to verify the terrible information. The information turns out to be correct and the scientists start to plan their escape from earth. They hope that it is possible to fly into space and land on Zyra, which will (hopefully) be suitable for humans.Randall suddenly finds himself in the middle of this whole affair, in love with the daughter of one of the scientists. This may also be his ticket aboard the ship to Zyra. However, Randall may be a rogue, but he also has a conscience. When it is time to choose which 40 people will make the journey, Randall gives up his seat. He does not feel that he has earned the right, that there are other more worthy people to take the seat.This might be so, but when the time comes to leave earth, Randall finds an unlikely ally that may help him out in the hour of need&#x85;When Worlds Collide is an old movie. It certainly has a story that it wish to explore, but with today's knowledge, the thought of a planet (or maybe even two) crashing into earth seems&#x85; ludicrous. Sure, a comet, asteroid or even a meteor would have been fine, but two planets passing through earth's orbit within a month&#x85; I don't think so. Of course, I am not a scientist nor an astronomer.I know this movie was made in a different time, but I can't help but wonder about the reactions of the people when they hear that earth is doomed. I would have thought that people would panic, but they don't, only in the very last second when Bellus is within a stone's throw. Sure, they might not believe in the information, but they must when the big red thing gets closer. To destroy earth is a pretty reckless thing, I don't think a little emotion is too much to ask.Another thing that really annoyed me. The ending. I don't mind the people reaching Zyra, nor that the planet is suitable for humans. What really annoys me was the use of a painted landscape. This might not have looked fake back in 1951 (although I think it did, unless the movie was in black and white originally), but it does today and when the landscape looks distinctly like earth, I can't help but wonder if they couldn't have found a real location somewhere, like in Asia? I won't even comment on the strange climate zones on Zyra (heavy snow and then 50 ft. away&#x85; a beautiful green meadow).Was there nothing that I liked in this movie? There certainly was. The character of Dave Randall, for one. He feels real and seems disturbed by the thought of dying in so young age. He acts cool, but also human when disaster strikes. I also liked the pace of the movie. Strangely enough, the movie does keep you entertained, maybe for the wrong reasons (the movie is quite funny), but still.As far as references go, there is a scene where New York is flooded, which reminded me of The Day After Tomorrow (Roland Emmerich, 2004), but also of 2012 (Roland Emmerich, 2009), where the humans built an ark of their own, only this one isn't supposed to leave earth.

It's a sad movie with an insight into war that is not often offered to viewers of war\/epic movies. The cast is excellent with legends such as Mel Gibson. This very heart wrenching and emotional movie has a slight comical element provided by Sam Elliot. I, being a fan of epic and war movies, had huge expectations for this movie and they were exceeded. Being based on the true story of when a group of around 400 American soldiers go into battle against almost 4000 Vietnamese soldiers in the valley of death in 1965, it truly shows viewers what war is really like, something many of us will never have to experience. It's non stop action with amazing effects but there is always the overwhelming sadness and awareness of the circumstances. We never forget about the wives back home or the children who will now grow up without fathers and this awareness is just emphasized by the fact that part of the movie is of the families receiving news of death and their reactions, often making viewers cry themselves. The viewers are in fact, so involved that the loss of a character feels like a loss to the viewer. Every single character is developed, even the Vietnamese. There are no heroes in this movie, although shown from American perspective the viewer is made aware of the fact that the Vietnamese may not be there by choice and also have families back home that will go on living without a husband or father. I was impressed by the fact that the film was made with the input and advice of the real Lt. Col. Hal Moore and widows of the deceased soldiers, making it just that little bit more real. With an overwhelmingly emotional yet exciting story and a bittersweet ending what more can you ask for? I, myself, did not cry as the only movie I've ever cried in is Braveheart(I'm not very emotional) but my entire family and friends were sobbing throughout. This movie is one of the most unforgettable movies I have ever seen and has left a lasting effect and impression on me. This movie just shows that with a duo like the incredible Mel Gibson and the amazing Randall Wallace, there are no mistakes. 10\/10 I highly recommend it to anyone.

Much of the film takes place inside an enormous mansion where the family of the female lead character lives.

Like Charlie Chaplin's comedies, My Man Godfrey imbues its jokes with wit, intelligence, and sentimentality. However, unlike Chaplin's comedies, which were mostly silent, Godfrey is filled with unbelievable noise. The characters chatter and whine and laugh and scream at each other, often all the same time, spewing one-liner after one-liner. These scenes build and build like a wave, and then crash. Eventually the dialogue takes on a rhythm that moves the entire film along. William Powell and Carole Lombard, who play the two main characters, steal every scene in which they appear. Gregory La Cava's career never soared as high as his contemporaries' did. But this doesn't change the fact that My Man Godfrey is one of the funniest, most-heartwarming American films ever made. Very few films have remained so vividly in my memory as this one. Only a few characters have made me feel as intrigued or sympathetic as Powell's Godfrey.

The character and story development was superbly done without sacrificing the pace of the film. The film was centered on a coming of age theme where the young characters become more mature and discover how their actions affect other while trying to break away from the stereotypes that have been placed on them by their peers. The movie centered on the development of five main characters, with each having a different stereotype applied to them, while spending Saturday detection with one another. Emilio Estevez was the athlete Andrew Clark, Anthony Michael Hall was the brain Brian Johnson, Judd Nelson was the criminal John Bender, Molly Ringwald was the princess Claire Standish, and Ally Sheedy was the basket case Allison Reynolds. When the movie starts each of these characters is introduced with these stereotypes and at first they defend these roles that society has determined that they fit into. John the criminal is the main catalyst in the movie for the other characters to start to examine their roles in life and how following these roles effects themselves and others. He acts out and forces the others into conversations and taking action, when they would have just kept to themselves for the entire detention. John forces the characters to rethink the way they act and the reasons for their actions. I love how this mechanic is used to develop the characters in the story.Each character finds that what that the roles they have taken where a result of their parents, and other peers pressure placed upon them and that they are deeply unhappy with their lives. The criminal John finds that he does not happy with hiding his emotions through violence and vandalism and emotionally opens up through the film. Clair the princess comes to the realization that she is not happy with being forced into such a culturally restive life and wants to be a more carefree person. Ally the basket case is tired of being rejected and ignored by her parents and fellow students and learns that she can still have meaningful social relationships with others. Andrew the athlete learns that it is OK to be weak and Brian the brain learns that he does not have to be academically perfect.

The character and story development was superbly done without sacrificing the pace of the film. The film was centered on a coming of age theme where the young characters become more mature and discover how their actions affect other while trying to break away from the stereotypes that have been placed on them by their peers. The movie centered on the development of five main characters, with each having a different stereotype applied to them, while spending Saturday detection with one another. Emilio Estevez was the athlete Andrew Clark, Anthony Michael Hall was the brain Brian Johnson, Judd Nelson was the criminal John Bender, Molly Ringwald was the princess Claire Standish, and Ally Sheedy was the basket case Allison Reynolds. When the movie starts each of these characters is introduced with these stereotypes and at first they defend these roles that society has determined that they fit into. John the criminal is the main catalyst in the movie for the other characters to start to examine their roles in life and how following these roles effects themselves and others. He acts out and forces the others into conversations and taking action, when they would have just kept to themselves for the entire detention. John forces the characters to rethink the way they act and the reasons for their actions. I love how this mechanic is used to develop the characters in the story.Each character finds that what that the roles they have taken where a result of their parents, and other peers pressure placed upon them and that they are deeply unhappy with their lives. The criminal John finds that he does not happy with hiding his emotions through violence and vandalism and emotionally opens up through the film. Clair the princess comes to the realization that she is not happy with being forced into such a culturally restive life and wants to be a more carefree person. Ally the basket case is tired of being rejected and ignored by her parents and fellow students and learns that she can still have meaningful social relationships with others. Andrew the athlete learns that it is OK to be weak and Brian the brain learns that he does not have to be academically perfect.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"4 May 2013","score":"","review":" The '80s were a time of horror movies attempting to, basically, recreate John Carpenter's Halloween (1978). Very few films succeeded, and Friday the 13th (1980) is one of the only ones to receive its own franchise and to go on to inspire even more films.Before continuing, let's get one question answered is Friday the 13th a good, frightening movie? And, to put it bluntly, the answer is no. The acting is (in all cases besides Betsy Palmer's) anywhere around okay to laughable. If you're watching an edited for TV version, it's almost not worthwhile to watch. The end chase scene between Betsy Palmer and Adrienne King goes on for far too long. But Friday the 13th doesn't set out to be a perfect, thought-out masterpiece. It achieves what it wants to do keep you on the edge of your seat, keep you (somewhat) frightened, and (if you are unaware that Pamela Voorhees is the killer), keep you guessing. And for some this movie does achieve what it sets out to do. Some viewers probably will hesitate before turning off the lights to go to sleep. In the simplest terms, Friday the 13th is entertaining and occasionally creepy. Nothing more, nothing less.And even though this film doesn't manage to scare as much as many other films in its genre, it (and Part 2 as well) belong on the shelf of any horror film fanatic, because Halloween and Friday the 13th both gave a lot to the genre. Without them, the '80s gore-fest never would have occurred (whether or not that is the best or worst thing to happen to the genre depends on who you're talking to). Without these films, the rules of horror films would never have been eternally set in stone. Basically, this film is by no means the best, but it was a very heavy influence on the genre as a whole, and in order to appreciate modern horror films (mainly slashers, but some other sub-genres draw inspiration from this as well), we must first thank Friday the 13th.

The good stuff is obvious, a never-handsomer, suntanned Cary Grant at his easy-going best, Grace Kelly, a less capable actress and the unlikely pursuer of the diffident reformed cat-burglar John Robie character Grant plays, but looking very lovely indeed, some fine, indeed Oscar-winning cinematography from Robert Burks and some typically individual Hitchcock scenes, but there are drawbacks too.The story is slight, the action quite slow-moving, the background music overly-frivolous and intrusive, with too many scenes guilty of running on too long, even the car chase scene is uninvolving and ends dully. The denouement too, lacks suspense and in the end I found myself admiring the skills of the afore-mentioned Grant & Burks than really following the story, which definitely has a puffed-up feel to it.Amongst the memorable scenes Hitchcock delivers this time are the immediate juxtaposition of the robbery victim's scream after the travel-agency tour-type opening title sequence, Grant & Kelly's firework of a kiss and the celebrated Mother comes too final shot, but even these aren't in the vanguard of Hitch's very best work.Perhaps this tale of the idle rich didn't engage due to the fecklessness of the leads, but it seems to me having gone to France for the shoot, perhaps the great director got influenced too much by the sunny sky and pretty scenery, giving too much screen time to landscape shots and while the dialogue is occasionally racy, especially during Kelly's seduction of Grant, there's too much of it and too much of it which is superfluous to requirements.Nevertheless as an advertisement for the French Riviera, it does a good job, but as a mystery-thriller it probably doesn't quite make it.
