First of all, it's the Queens (a part by Cate Blanchett) lovelife.

At the time Elizabeth comes to power England is a catholic country, but Elizabeth is protestant. Both sides 'meet' each other in what apparently became the Anglican church. That's a thing I didn't know yet. You see, you *can* learn things from the movies.The acting is impecable and it all looks great, but like other costume drama's it just won't stick with me. At the time of the last (great!) scene I was a bit bored ... is it just me?Strong performances make it a 5\/10, but I'm sure fans of the genre (that includes the members of the Academy) will strongly disagree with me.

Halloween 2 suffered from a poor story but all things considered was a decent enough follow up. Halloween 3, well it was Michaeless so we wont go into it. I feel if under another title Halloween 3 would have stood up nicely on its on as a quite different little film. We do have Halloween 4, replace 3 with 4 and disregard parts 5 through the worst of them all 8 and the Halloween franchise becomes a tidy and taught trilogy. 4 has what it needs, Donald Pleasance first and foremost, this guy was the Halloween films. It also great continuity from part 2, Michaels been comatose after the after the explosion and Laurie Strode has died and left behind a niece to continue the Myers bloodline and provide a target for the soon revived and on the loose Shape. Halloween 4 does the job well and is for my money a better film then part 2. The story itself comes full circle with Michaels demise and his neice, in the same clown costume, murdering her mother to Dr. Loomis's shock and dismay. This ending should have been thee ending and the Halloween movies would be held in higher regard than then they are. Needless sequals have pretty much tarnished the Halloween mystique.  Sad since the original was pretty much a perfect movie. Halloween could also be a trilogy made up of parts 1,2 and 7 H20. H20 sees the return of  Jamie Lee as Laurie which is nice but with Pleasance gone and only present in the voice of a poorly done voice over, it just lacks the punch of 4. H20 in its own right is still a much better sequel then parts 5,6 or 8 and its up to you how youd like to view the Halloween trilogy. 1,2 and 7? or 1,2 and 4? Either way it makes for much better viewing than the rest of the horrid installments.

Yet, I didn't realise how much I loved LOTR until I saw this film.  Which is very unusual for me, being someone who tends to prefer books to films.  Whatever.  The Fellowship of the Ring is a beautifully crafted interpretation of Tolkiens vision of Middle Earth.  It looks beautiful, sounds beautiful and even feels beautiful, if that's possible.  There aren't many films where you can suspend disbelief entirely the way you do with the LOTR films.  I can't count how many times I have set out to watch this film and look at aspects of it's production - the relative sizes of the different races, the use of CGI - yet every time I just get sidetracked by the story and lose interest in the how and the why.  The first time I saw a picture of the cast onset in costume it totally threw me to see them in 'real' sizes.  I was absolutely convinced that the hobbits really were that small.The casting was spot on, the acting superb, I could go on and on and on but that would probably get boring.  Of the three films, this does feel like the longest, but my theory is that that is because of the nature of time in the film - FOTR takes place of a period of several months.  The principal action in TT and ROTK is much more compressed.  Of course there are lots of things missing, and Tom Bombadil was sadly missed, but overall I can't see how this film could have been any better.  And anyone who hasn't seen the extended edition is missing out.  It enhances the experience considerably ","genre":null},{"date":"26 May 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  **SPOILERS maybe**I've always loved Tolkien, having really re-discovered him at University.
