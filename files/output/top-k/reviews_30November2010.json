Great movie. Great story. And what a send off for the Man With No Name! And I don't care what the critics say of the dark, melancholic mood of the film, or the excessive violence, the unrealistic ending and so on. As a devoted fan of El Manco since the early days of his celluloid life, during the 60s, when as a young student used to go with my teenage friends, after school, see each one of his instalments, and even followed him later in his reincarnation as Dirty Harry, I think I deserved it. We deserved it, me and all those lunatics who recognized true value in what most great film experts had discarded as useless. Eastwood owed this to us. Because I'm talking of a time when Leone\/Eastwood was no more than a two--word punch line in Hollywood; when what that nutty Italian fellow was doing to the western was something to snicker at it, never to consider seriously. But by then already we, the fans, had come to realize that such a couple was the best thing ever happening to the genre. That's why I believe that this Leone-inspired final shootout in the bar was dedicated to us, the fans of the first hour; those who cheered at a time when the serious movie people, the experts, Hollywood, were all too busy laughing.Of course, for the purists, this is not an older MWNN--he was a bounty hunter, while Munny is an outlaw--and this is not an appendix to the Leone trilogy. On the other hand, if UF ends up in such an explosion of violence it's precisely because that's the way a Leone western must end, with El Manco mowing down the opposition and then riding away. The problem there was how to include such an epic, intense, yet unrealistic conclusion into an otherwise realistic plot. To this, the answer for most seems to be simply that Munny is still the reckless SOB he always was&#x97;but we, the old fans, know better there was no other possible way for CE's western persona to go but doing it à la Leone, the rest is excuse. So, those reviewers who worried about his kids' future may rest assured; everything is okay, Munny is not an out of control psycho. There was just the need for the spaghetti ending there.Then again, Leone's westerns never pretended to be realistic, that's why the violence in them flows freely, abundantly, to the point of exaggeration. More than anything else, they are Verdian Operas, they were meant to be enjoyed by their visuals, their atmosphere and their music. On the other hand, Unforgiven is more of Shakespearean drama, more akin to reality than to art itself. That's why we see here how people really suffer when abused, wounded, killed. That's the reason why its conclusion appears so amplified in its violence and brutality. Eastwood knew this and he also knew that he had to make the two sub-genres fit, merge, somehow--the obvious answer, as I said, was making of Munny an enduring SOAG of a killer. Now, as for the moral ambiguity to which everyone keep referring in these reviews, maybe so; but nobody can deny that the bloody end to Little Bill's little fascist regime was a good thing to happen after all, something to applaud rather than to regret. So El Manco fades away with still another good deed in his log. Good for him.Maybe IMDb doesn't look too kindly on this, but I have to mention the inordinate amount of nonsensical criticism I have seen in many negative reviews of the film. For ex., some complain that some of the English spoken here is post WWII. Gimme a break! Do they speak Old Latin in Shakespeare's Julius Cesar, by any chance? Or about the misanthropy of it the only women portrayed are prostitutes. GMAB again! At that time there were only two kinds of women in the West whores....and Claudias. Women who had already died by disease, giving birth or by fatigue; or who were too busy trying to survive, trying to raise the few surviving children they had left, to have time to appear in a saga like this. Some say also that the characters are one-dimensional, that they lack complexity. GMAB for a 3rd time! How that could have been otherwise when their lives were one-dimensional! The life of a prostitute was all about getting laid and getting paid. For the people working from dawn to dusk in the farms, well, that was their life. And so on. That's how rich and complex their lives were. The truth is, ordinary people have never had much time for philosophizing or for pondering about complex ideas. Ever since Antiquity the task of questioning the meaning of life, of wondering about God's existence and purposes, has been left to the affluent, real of fictional as they may be. People who don't have to worry about scratching a living each day. Socrates, Kant, Hamlet, Quixote were all affluent people. So, if you want to see people behaving in Unforgiven as they would do in Bonanza, tormentingly pondering on the ethics of collecting a debt from a poor widow or agonizing about how to say something to someone without hurting his feelings, then you have come to the wrong place. Finally, for the criticism about too much violence in the film, I'll just recall half a million dead, in a very real, just ended, civil war.A great movie and perhaps an enduring classic. Great acting all across the board. But I think that the best actors here were those two kids, who managed to keep perfectly straight faces while Munny was doing his Curly-tries-to-get-on-horseback number.

","genre":"Western"},{"date":"30 November 2010","score":"","review":" The robbery should have taken 10 minutes. 4 hours later, the bank was like a circus sideshow. 8 hours later, it was the hottest thing on live TV. 12 hours later, it was all history. And it's all true.This tagline says it all perfectly. In 1972 a bisexual man robbed a bank to pay for his gay lover's sex change. It should have gone smooth and simple but exploded into a media extravaganza that ended up taking twelve hours to get sorted out, just as the tagline states. Dog Day Afternoon is the film that came out of these events. Al Pacino plays Sonny Wortzik, the man robbing the bank with his friend Sal, played by the late and great John Cazale. The entirety of the movie is set during the robbery with no setup of the characters or backstory. Everything we need to know unfolds amidst the action. The movie is tremendous in its claustrophobic and limited setting in a small bank on a New York street corner.Al Pacino is the shining star of this film. He plays his character to perfection, and is absolutely fascinating and exciting to watch. I couldn't see anyone in this role except for the vulgar and fast talking Pacino. John Cazale as Sal is also an excellent casting decision, despite the fact he has few lines in the film. But what he does for the film is eerily excellent. Sal remains at a level of high strung paranoia the entire film, restoring its harrowing attitude when it starts to dwindle. Other major players include Charles Durning as the police chief who tries to subtly out wit Sonny throughout the movie, maintaining his calm and collected attitude so as not to stir up any unnecessary excitement from his armed counterpart. Chris Sarandon plays Leon, Sonny's gay lover who appears in one of the most intimate and sincere scenes of the entire film. Every bit of his scene had my eyes glued to the screen. It was one of the many places we got to see the different intensity levels of Sonny, who was loud and frightening in some scenes, then calm and sentimental in others. It all added to his perfect characterization.The entire cast of the bank, which includes the bank manager and a number of female bank tellers also do a fantastic job at driving the intimate character interaction at the heart of this film. Their response to the bank robbery is complete and utter cooperation, so as to protect their own lives. But as media attention grows around the robbery, they seize the opportunity for their own 15 minutes of fame, and even end up befriending Sonny who doesn't want to hurt anybody, he just wants money. It's a fascinating study of human interaction under extreme pressure that bares some interesting and even comical results when we see how the friendly relationship unfolds between Sonny and the teller girls. Then of course we see the reaction of the outside to this situation. Sonny becomes an instant draw of attention for anybody looking for some good reality television on a hot summer day in New York. But more interestingly, he even molds into a hero to the anti law enforcement advocates in the city who come to the robbery scene and cheer him on. People with all sorts of opposing opinions come to watch this robbery unfold, and it makes for a brilliantly played out character study.Fascinatingly enough, Dog Day Afternoon covers a lot of societal ground for being such a limited plot and setting. It deals with law enforcement influence, mainstream media and its effects on society, and even gay rights. The reveal that this tough bank robber is gay stirs up so much confusion in the accumulated crowd. There are people who immediately turn against Sonny when they learn this, but he also then inspires a whole other community, those who support gay rights and transexuality. As the movie unfolds Sonny's stardom branches to so many places, and the way we see him deal with it all is incredible, due to the fact that he is still worrying about how to get away with this bank robbery.Despite its limited resources, this movie stays very exciting the entire way through, and it was one of those movies where I was so drawn in by everything that was happening that I never wanted it to end. The film stems across so many different genres, and it all flows together so seamlessly. It begins as a typical heist film and develops into a smart crime thriller with some bits of comedy splashed in there, but never overplayed or forced. It then morphs into a deeply emotional drama at points as well as a sentimental and highly unconventional romance. It is amazing how well this blend of genres works in perfect motion together with no aspect of the film becoming overbearing. Everything comes together exquisitely, and I enjoy it all anymore.Dog Day Afternoon works as a character study, a crime thriller, and a drama. It is a fascinating story that covers so much ground, but doesn't force feed any one idea to you. Lumet stays respectful to the story he is telling by making it an exciting and thrilling story that focuses so well and so strongly on the development of Sonny, who no one could have played as excellently as Al Pacino. This movie has become one of my new favorites.

But as media attention grows around the robbery, they seize the opportunity for their own 15 minutes of fame, and even end up befriending Sonny who doesn't want to hurt anybody, he just wants money. It's a fascinating study of human interaction under extreme pressure that bares some interesting and even comical results when we see how the friendly relationship unfolds between Sonny and the teller girls. Then of course we see the reaction of the outside to this situation. Sonny becomes an instant draw of attention for anybody looking for some good reality television on a hot summer day in New York. But more interestingly, he even molds into a hero to the anti law enforcement advocates in the city who come to the robbery scene and cheer him on. People with all sorts of opposing opinions come to watch this robbery unfold, and it makes for a brilliantly played out character study.Fascinatingly enough, Dog Day Afternoon covers a lot of societal ground for being such a limited plot and setting. It deals with law enforcement influence, mainstream media and its effects on society, and even gay rights. The reveal that this tough bank robber is gay stirs up so much confusion in the accumulated crowd. There are people who immediately turn against Sonny when they learn this, but he also then inspires a whole other community, those who support gay rights and transexuality. As the movie unfolds Sonny's stardom branches to so many places, and the way we see him deal with it all is incredible, due to the fact that he is still worrying about how to get away with this bank robbery.Despite its limited resources, this movie stays very exciting the entire way through, and it was one of those movies where I was so drawn in by everything that was happening that I never wanted it to end. The film stems across so many different genres, and it all flows together so seamlessly. It begins as a typical heist film and develops into a smart crime thriller with some bits of comedy splashed in there, but never overplayed or forced. It then morphs into a deeply emotional drama at points as well as a sentimental and highly unconventional romance. It is amazing how well this blend of genres works in perfect motion together with no aspect of the film becoming overbearing. Everything comes together exquisitely, and I enjoy it all anymore.Dog Day Afternoon works as a character study, a crime thriller, and a drama. It is a fascinating story that covers so much ground, but doesn't force feed any one idea to you. Lumet stays respectful to the story he is telling by making it an exciting and thrilling story that focuses so well and so strongly on the development of Sonny, who no one could have played as excellently as Al Pacino.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"30 November 2010","score":"","review":" The robbery should have taken 10 minutes. 4 hours later, the bank was like a circus sideshow. 8 hours later, it was the hottest thing on live TV. 12 hours later, it was all history. And it's all true.This tagline says it all perfectly. In 1972 a bisexual man robbed a bank to pay for his gay lover's sex change. It should have gone smooth and simple but exploded into a media extravaganza that ended up taking twelve hours to get sorted out, just as the tagline states. Dog Day Afternoon is the film that came out of these events. Al Pacino plays Sonny Wortzik, the man robbing the bank with his friend Sal, played by the late and great John Cazale. The entirety of the movie is set during the robbery with no setup of the characters or backstory. Everything we need to know unfolds amidst the action. The movie is tremendous in its claustrophobic and limited setting in a small bank on a New York street corner.Al Pacino is the shining star of this film. He plays his character to perfection, and is absolutely fascinating and exciting to watch. I couldn't see anyone in this role except for the vulgar and fast talking Pacino. John Cazale as Sal is also an excellent casting decision, despite the fact he has few lines in the film. But what he does for the film is eerily excellent. Sal remains at a level of high strung paranoia the entire film, restoring its harrowing attitude when it starts to dwindle. Other major players include Charles Durning as the police chief who tries to subtly out wit Sonny throughout the movie, maintaining his calm and collected attitude so as not to stir up any unnecessary excitement from his armed counterpart. Chris Sarandon plays Leon, Sonny's gay lover who appears in one of the most intimate and sincere scenes of the entire film. Every bit of his scene had my eyes glued to the screen. It was one of the many places we got to see the different intensity levels of Sonny, who was loud and frightening in some scenes, then calm and sentimental in others. It all added to his perfect characterization.The entire cast of the bank, which includes the bank manager and a number of female bank tellers also do a fantastic job at driving the intimate character interaction at the heart of this film.

He more and more starts loosing it and looses both his grip on reality and the ability to keep himself and his urges under control. In all honesty, the best serial killer movies are all like this and instead of picking a real storyline it focuses more on the madness and its main character.It's a pleasantly directed movie, that picks a more light approach, rather than an heavy serious one and it takes us into the insane world and mind of the main character. The movie doesn't ever really become an odd or eccentric one but it still does a very good job at capturing the right mood and atmosphere.But it's also really definitely true that the movie and its characters work out due to the acting. Christian Bale is really perfect and quite amazing that this guy still hasn't been nominated for an Oscar, considering all of the great roles he has played over the last couple of years, this movie of course included. He's perfectly obsessive, cocky and charming and he was for a huge part responsible for me liking this movie as much as i did. But the movie also really has an impressive supporting cast list. It aren't really the names that are know by the big audience but it are names that are always respected and liked by the experts. Not to sound nit-picky but I wasn't as pleased with the casting of some of the female roles. Not because they're not great actors but more because of their very plain looks. The character of Bateman is supposed to be surrounded, admired and chased after by the most beautiful women and I'm sorry but most women in this movie just aren't that impressive looking. Perhaps it's due to the fact that this is a movie that got directed by a female, so she might not have had such an eye for it as a man would had.

This time round the music is by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz, a lesser-known duo, but their tunes are certainly pretty enough, while their witty and often satirical lyrics make them suited to this nifty take on the long-established backstage musical.There was a bit of a trend round this time in Hollywood for pictures in which the career of the star and their character mirrored one another. Just like Tony Hunter, Fred Astaire really was thought to be an anachronism in some quarters, and had only recently come out of the first of his three retirements. The Band Wagon is to Astaire effectively a light-hearted and less cruel equivalent of what Sunset Boulevard (1950) was to Gloria Swanson, or what A Star is Born (1954) would be to Judy Garland. And while it may swap screen for stage, many of its cheeky digs apply to both media &#x96; the misguided vision of a slightly out-of-touch producer, the poaching of stars from different disciplines, the embarrassment of a badly-received premier. There's even spoofing of previous Freed\/Minnelli musicals such as The Pirate (the pyrotechnics in the latter movie's daydream sequence are exaggerated her in the Cordova stage show), and of course the Girl Hunt ballet, which lampoons all those convoluted film noirs like The Big Sleep and Out of the Past with spot-on precision, right down to the mean dialogue that is not far from what you really heard in some of the more lowbrow crime thrillers. Girl Hunt is one of the funniest and rhythmically beautiful moments in the picture, and it alone makes the picture worth the watch.Director Vincente Minnelli could really bring a musical like this to life unlike anyone else. His style, a little ostentatious in a drama, is perfect here because it is a kind of choreography. Of course, anyone can have a hard cut or a whip-pan to emphasise a dynamic phrase, but it's the way Minnelli responds to the subtleties of the music that make him stand out. Take the very laid-back By Myself number. Those various people walking in the opposite direction to Astaire are timed to the occasional little twiddles in the underscoring. It's a really delicate balance here &#x96; those bits of business are not dancey enough to distract from the smoothness of the song or stop Fred being the focus of attention, and yet they add just enough to make it a little more interesting than simply him walking along an empty platform. There are also some great examples here of Minnelli's bold use of colour, in which funnily enough it is often the more muted shades that stand out. For example, when Astaire meets Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant at the station, the three of them are dressed in grey while all the bolder tones are used for background detail. While all Freed musicals have a deliberately unreal look to them even outside of the musical numbers, it's important that this doesn't spill over into making the people and places look ridiculous. It's Minnelli's good taste in these situations that bridges the gap between the idealised musical world and settings we can relate to.And what of the cast, all willingly lampooning if not themselves then at least their trade? Astaire always had a bit of a self-deprecating streak, and he appears to have good fun with the more comical scenes in particular. However unlike Tony Hunter, The Band Wagon failed to regenerate Astaire's career, perhaps because it doesn't quite make such spectacular displays of his dancing as did his older movies, and perhaps because he really was now an old-fashioned player. Whatever the case he went on to have only middling successes for the rest of his career. Astaire also happens to be overshadowed by the supporting performances in this one &#x96; Nanette Fabray and her delightfully amusing array of facial expressions, Oscar Levant going a little over the top but still showing great comic timing, and most of all Jack Buchanan. Buchanan absolutely excels in his wild and well-informed caricature of the flamboyant theatre impresario, hilarious even when underplaying, such as when he gets hoisted aloft like a puppet by incompetent stagehands, funnier still when overplaying, such as his crazed acting-out of the Faust story to a group of backers, which Minnelli shrewdly gives us in little snippets through a doorway. Buchanan never really made a big impression in any other screen appearance, but as the madcap Jeff Cordova he deserved at least a nod for Best Supporting Actor.The Band Wagon is not only a fantastic musical; it represents one of the nicest things about Hollywood in the post-war era. For every film noir or gritty drama that picked apart its subject manner with brutal cynicism, there always seemed to be a comedy or a musical doing the same thing in a gentle and even joyful manner. Writers Betty Comden and Adolph Green jumped on the band wagon of Show Business introspection, for an intelligent script that some might dismiss as froth, but only because it lacks the sombre tone of Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve. And it was the brilliance of those Comden, Green, Freed and Minnelli that could turn a gloomy subgenre into something as vibrant and appealing as this. That's Entertainment indeed.

Newman can do stoical, monosyllabic character-study but not as well as Eastwood, likewise director Martin Ritt's work owes too much to the hugely popular Man With No Name prototype.It gets off to a slow start when the biggest questions are exactly when the first piece of spoken dialogue will emerge and will Newman retain his ill-fitting Red Indian wig all the way through the film.

Although I must agree with many others that Julie Andrews is miscast and possibly not well directed (why couldn't she be convincing in love here when it worked in Sound of music?), most other aspects of the first half of the film works well. Getting into East Germany turns out to be a lot more exciting than getting out. First we don't really know whether prof Armstrong is defecting or making a double act. Then we don't really, really know if the slimy bodyguard Gromek (Wolfgang Kieling) is there to stop them from escaping or, having formerly lived USA, is there to help them. He is also a strong character both in tension and humor. His comments about American culture and food are very entertaining. You can't really decide whether to hate or like him.But after Gromek leaves the story six feet below (after the best action scene in the movie), the only person who keeps things rolling is professor Lindt (Ludwig Donath). The final scene with him, writing formulas on the blackboard, is vital but still makes me a bit uneasy. They should really discuss principles and ideas, not just write formulas like on some kind of math lecture. It is a key scene of the movie and I feel that it, at least partially, resorts to the stupid idea that science is all about finding the magic formula.From that point, I feel that I have seen it all before.

This interesting character study about success, greed and unethical journalism is still relevant to date. Or you think that some media professionals don't act like J.J. Hensecker? Well, maybe yes, maybe no. I think people have a little bit of tact while doing things because they remember the famous quote Treat people good and with respect, on your way up since you will meet the same people on your way down. But this is not one of J.J.'s quotes so you're going to enter in a ferocious and careless world but it's a cinema masterpiece. 10\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"30 November 2010","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" What can I say.

Selznick and Alfred Hitchcock seemed to go halves in creative effort on a polished piece of stagnant entertainment in their ceremonial Paradine Case. Dub it a mystery melodrama, even if that doesn't completely sum it up any more than it did Rebecca, a preceding, much superior production by the two. Classify it as a romantic courtroom would-be tragedy alongside a marriage soap opera. It's all of these things rolled together in one intermittently interesting movie, effortlessly told via Hitchcock's sophisticated camera.If you recall the lingering distress which Rebecca, the apparition femme fatale of that film, set off all the other characters, albeit she herself was dead, that's the kind of shadowy trouble that the poised Mrs. Paradine affects all the characters in this narrative, except she's quite alive. Nevertheless, her husband, a blind man, is dead and she's on trial for his murder. The story itself has much prospective tension, especially putting Mrs. Paradine at the hub of the drama. It's never cut and dried what she's up to and though the seductive effect of a woman under suspicion on a man with influence is and was nothing new, the plot progresses on its own distinctive path, as she is a distinctive character. The issue is that, unlike Hitchcock's British films, this American Hitchcock film set in Britain dulls the blade of the dramatic elements and turns. Hitchcock's camera has a way of acting like an adept trial lawyer, whirring calmly along with customary material and swiftly punctuating with fluent theatrics, and also unsurprisingly, the movie's furnishings have a lush David O. Selznick guise. However, despite Hitchcock's simplistic mastery of when and how to move the camera, each scene is a dialogue piece that I, to my own surprise, found would be much more impactful in other, perhaps grittier and more contemporary hands.Slowly, overemotionally, but gracefully enough, this picture files the potentially much more intriguing story of the eponymous widow's swaying lure over many who are impinged on by her trial, in addition to a predetermined eye-opener to the nature of the character herself. It makes a pale wink at the covetousness she provokes in the officiating judge, a typically sharp-tongued Charles Laughton whose urbane hostility has altogether sent his wife over the edge, another powerful narrative element that seems to have been glossed over. There's also disquieting suggestion of Mrs. Paradine's clutch on her husband's valet, a man upon whom keen suspicion is aimed before and during the trial, though mainly it follows the zeal she rouses in the stiff-postured man appointed as her defending counsel and of the torment this causes his wife.Gregory Peck is fervent as the prominent young London barrister who lets his heart, callously ensnared by his client, control his head, while Ann Todd would be much more persuasively grief-stricken as his wife were it not for Franz Waxman's gushy score being poured on her every word like syrup. Italian import Alida Valli makes the confined Mrs. Paradine a composite of inscrutability, ambiguity and sensuality, and Louis Jourdan is pretty intense as the harassed valet.It isn't a momentous Hitchcock effort by a long shot, save to the degree that it infers the cave dweller beneath everyone's practiced etiquette and concrete integrity and barristers' wigs. And it isn't a momentous script either, for the intent of cinema that is, developed by Selznick himself from Robert Hichens' novel. After a hazy buildup of evidence and of passion in the lawyer's heart, the story finally goes into a static but enthralling courtroom and thankfully remains there for most of the second hour.

The main problem seemed to be that the budgets of the sequels were slashed every time, resulting in 'Battle' having a very cheap feel to it. The make-up is noticeably poor and the sets are very unimpressive &#x96; the Ape City appears to be a few huts and fences in a woodland plain. The final confrontation that the title of the film promises proves to be an underwhelming affair too. It's more of a skirmish between two small groups. All-in-all the whole production suffers in every way from a lacklustre feel.The story is set in a post-nuclear world. Apes and men still live side-by-side although the cracks are beginning to show. An expedition to the ruins of the old city results in mutant-men seeing and following our heroes with the intention of wiping them out militarily.It's certainly a watchable film in a Wednesday afternoon kind of a way. But it isn't anything very good at all. The action scenes are tagged on and don't have any real urgency about them; while the dramatic conflict between the aggressive gorillas and the peaceful chimps and orang-utans is not particularly well done. And in one scene a young chimp dies from falling from a tree but judging by the height of the branch in a subsequent scene he must've fallen all of two-and-a-half metres.

Repossessed is written and directed by the guy who made Meatballs 4. That should probably give you a fair idea of what this movie is like, though it does feature less Corey Feldman water-skiing than expected. Somewhat surprisingly there are some jokes in here that work (the bible vending machine ruled), but overall this just really feels like everyone's trying way, way too hard. Especially the visual gags have that bothersome laugh, damn it! feel to them, they're so close to Naked Gun but just not quite. Same goes for the obligatory breakings of the fourth wall, not bad but not really focused enough to generate big laughs. Nielsen's talents are rather wasted here, though I must say he is about the only element that made me keep watching. It's also a very nice touch that Linda Blair agreed to do this movie, even though I have absolutely no idea why she did. Not because of the solid screenplay, I'm pretty sure of that. This is in all ways a sub-par spoof, but I reckon it's still watchable for avid Nielsen fans.
