While Clement's version is generally excellent and intelligently conceived, the censorship constrains of the era rendered the film too subdued in its treatment of the homoerotic sexual undertones of the source material to really have an impact on the audience. Mingella's film, however, is substantially more explicit and candourous in both its theme and content, permitting both for the characters to be depicted in all their multifaceted and variable glory and for a visceral degree of suspense to develop long before the bodies even start piling up.Concurrently a modernist exploration of film noir &#x96; stressing the Byzantine plot schematics, dreamlike visuals, and behavioural factors of the genre's archetypes with delicious hyperbole &#x96; and a conservative dissection of vanity and hedonism (something of a contrast with Highsmith's glorification of those things in her original novel), the film primarily looks at social status, with the work's two main characters &#x96; Tom Ripley and Dickie Greenleaf (two excellent performances from Matt Damon and Jude Law &#x96; representing the higher (Dickie) and lower (Tom) levels of the social taxonomy.By using film noir's archetypes &#x96; characters whom either allow their affluence or high social status to persuade them to pursue impossible goals or whom, if poor, obsess with 'making a quick buck' &#x96;, Minghella is able to both mock the vices of high society and, through investing sympathy in Ripley's character through the indifferent and intermittently cruel behaviour that Dickie directs toward him, expose both the superficiality and the manipulative and temporal nature of a high social status (along with the 'la dolce vita' lifestyle it connotes). However, this point is most effectively illustrated not through Dickie's representation of the upper classes, but through Tom Ripley's destructive pursuit of them. From the film's opening montage of Ripley's squalid existence in the ghettos of New York, we see his burning desire to be among a higher class of people surmised brilliantly with such images as him wiping a rich man's jacket in his capacity as a lavatory attendant and his forbidden look into a recital from behind the curtain of a personal booth. Ripley is willing to do practically anything to achieve a higher status; firstly becoming acquainted with jazz (which he clearly dislikes) as a means to befriend Dickie, then demonstrating all his skills of mimicry and forging, along with revealing the intent of his meeting Dickie, to preserve that friendship, to finally killing Dickie and stealing his identity.As matters escalate, so do Ripley's methods of preserving his wrongfully-obtained status. He murders Dickie's inquisitive friend Freddie Miles (a Seymour Hoffman performance fleetingly glimpsed though worthy of a thousand accolades), fakes Dickie's suicide, attempts to murder Dickie's former fiancée Marge Sherwood (Paltrow in one of her better roles), and, in the film's haunting dénouement, murders Peter Smith-Kingsley (Jack Davenport), the only character in the whole film who has the potential to offer Tom some sort of salvation. And as Ripley's finally descends into an incubus of guilt and regret, the film finally presents his status anxiety as hubris with the line I always thought it would be better, to be a fake somebody... than a real nobody.Yet these reflections are simply the eventualities of the film's exploration of it's thematic concerns; what really matters is that this is a beautifully photographed (John Seale's best work), superbly scripted, wonderfully acted, exquisitely scored (Gabriel Yared channels Bernard Herrmann with such professional austerity that one would think that Yared is Herrmann's reincarnation), and, dare I write, 'talentedly' directed.

I mean cars are not supposed to jump ten feet in the air and keep running, people are not supposed to fall off high buildings and survive and when ten people fire machine guns at you for a minute you are supposed to be hit by a few bullets. But you can't judge those movies based on this because they are just for-fun movies. It is however, a different story when a movie tries to pass itself as dark reality, and such movie should be held accountable for illogical occurrences and far fetched events. Se7en has a couple of these, plus a massive contradiction that blows the entire premise of the film to pieces. This is where I'm starting.John Doe is not the kind of indiscriminate killer Ted Bundy or the Washington sniper were. He is a lunatic with a mission, a mission to get the society rid of the parasites and would have no problem in torturing those parasites and inflict the greatest pain and humiliation on them, but he would NEVER harm an innocent soul. Examples in real life are numerous, and a search for serial killers who for example targeted prostitutes would show this pattern; blood thirsty animals when they are killing their victims (parasites), but otherwise they are excellent family men, great husbands, faithful friends and kind fathers who would never do as a small an offence as littering. So, when at the end we were told that John Doe killed an innocent, we had to stop and think hard about it for a minute.Tracy is the innocent party here, killing her is simply going against the psychology of the killer they drew in the first two hours of the movie. Apologetics would say Doe's sin is Envy, Tracy is the victim of his sin, he was punished for this sin by Mills who then paid for his sin (Wrath) by going to jail and losing his job. This is beyond idiotic, to believe that Doe will punish sinners while he was a sinner himself is a statement that he is a hypocrite. Could be fine, but hypocrites are hypocrites, they don't have enough faith to be dedicated to a cause to the extent of sacrificing their own lives for it as Doe did, or else they would not be hypocrites!!! It is like saying all lawyers are liars and I am a lawyer, am I lying? And, even if we ignore all of this, how can Doe say he envied Mills? He never knew of his existence when he started his chain of crimes. And even if, what did he envy him for? The vibrating house? The depressed wife or the $hitty detective salary? Oh, they tell us that he did envy him for his simple man's life, and went home to try and play the husband as if there was a chance in hell she would accept him and kick Mills out!! No? No chance?? Then he knew he was lying when he claimed that he envied Mills and hoped to live his life, and if he knew he was lying then he knew he was not envious, thus sacrificing his life would not complete his mission, unless his mission was turning only 6 sins on the sinners then kill a guy who never envied anyone just for the kicks of it....... Understand anything? Read it again, and when you finally get it you will see the mess this film is, needing one messy explanation like this.I liked it when he did not kill Mills in the alley and later called and asked for his forgiveness. This is what a killer in the this mentality would do, harm parasites but has all respect for the safety of innocent parties... But killing innocent Tracy even after he knew there was an innocent child inside her is just as sensible as Paris Hilton is useful.The couple of minor flaws I spoke of earlier are just bad directing; Doe arranged for the delivery at 7, so he insisted that they move to where he allegedly hid the two remaining bodies at exactly 6 o'clock. Now wouldn't you be very alarmed if the killer asks for a specific time to go pick up the bodies? I'm not saying they should have refused the deal because of it, but at least they should have had some serious tense discussions on why he insists on a specific time for this, fearing there might be a time bomb or something out there. But they never even give it a thought.The second minor flaw is when the SWAT team leader in the chopper checks the area near the end of the journey and says there are no ambushes there, then a minute later the car stops next to a large trailer that could have had an elephant and 14 Al-Qaeda members hidden inside. If that trailer was not a potential ambush, what kind of ambush was he looking for then? A giant spring loaded mouse trap hidden under the sand??? Stupid!

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"25 February 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Maximum Overdrive isn't a dreadful movie, but neither can it be considered any kind of classic as some reviewers have anointed. At best (or worst), it's just a slightly below average flick by a first-time director. It's only real draw is that it's Stephen King's directorial debut and swansong (or ugly duckling, depending on your viewpoint).If you haven't guessed, King took his classic short story Trucks and fleshed it out into a full-length movie. He also took the directorial reins for the only time.The movie deals with the after-effects of a comet that passes Earth, bathing the planet in its tail radiation for three days. As a result, trucks and other mechanical items come to life with deadly results. A group of survivors gather in a roadside diner as semis besiege them.Some have described the movie as tongue-in-cheek and some of the performances might make you think so. But, the movie, overall, tries hard to be dramatic and kills the humorous side of it early on.The problems here in the movie come mainly from King himself. If you've ever read his stories, he puts so much detail into them that the reader can not only believe them, but imagine that they are part of the tale. Of course, words often work better than pictures because we have to imagine what we're reading.In Maximum Overdrive, King adds in a lot of inconsistencies. Trucks come to life, but not cars. An M-60 not only shoots more bullets than it carries but somehow manages to swivel around on its own. Yet, no other gun in the movie fires on its own.Somehow we are supposed to believe that an electric knife can come to life and chase a waitress. A hairdryer can somehow choke a woman to death with its cord. A Walkman can kill a man by sending...what, a weak battery surge into his ears? King lets us down with his lack of believability, surprising from a man who terrorized us with a demonic dry cleaning press (The Mangler short story).The cast is not awful, but not great. Emilio Estevez as the hero is, well, just okay. Not particularly believable but he gives it some gusto. Yeardley Smith as one half of a married couple is hilarious and it's fun to listen to her, if only to hear shades of Lisa Simpson and other characters she did on shows like Herman's Head, Brothers and Dharma & Greg.

For whatever reason, he cannot re-create the suspense and terror of his short story. He can't impart the sense of foreboding or doom. That said, King does include a killer soundtrack with AC\/DC, so you can score him one for that.In the end, we have characters we really don't care about fighting trucks that are about as terrifying as Tonka toys.It's easy to see why King never directed another film.

It would be improper to compare this gem to the likes of Goodfellas (1990), big budget American gangster films and Guy Ritchie Brit slick criminal films. No.1 is in the vein of The Krays (1990) and has a for the most part a traditional narrative. That said, Director Paul McGuigan has a grand visual flare and Johnny Ferguson's screenplay takes the time to actually delve into the psyche of gangster who is arguably more psychopath that sociopath, (either way he is a killer). Ferguson's script gives the dialogue weight and realism which can be very thought provoking at times.McGuigan superbly crafts the period pieces of 60's London right through to the 90's, with fantastic set design, locations, music soundtrack and score. The viewer gets to witness England in all its swingin' 60's glory. The direction and Andrew Hulme's editing isn't mediocre and great effort has been made to make you feel the emotion that happens on screen, especially when there is a killer and victim scene. The use of P.O.V, manipulated shots and stylised lighting are used to achieve this. There are some gruesome and violent scenes, which is to be expected given the genre.

I decided to first watch Bruce Lees first movie (The big boss), which was laughably horrible (dogs jumping through the air and stuff). So then I wanted to see Lee's debut movie, Way of the dragon aka Return of the Dragon. I read on rottentomatoes.com that it actually was Lee's best movie, so I had great hopes on that one. But after watching this one I am badly disappointed.The Story is about the Chinese fighter Tang Lung (Bruce Lee) who comes to Rome to help out at a restaurant of a friend of him. The owner of the place, a young girl, is threatened by a syndicate which wants to buy the restaurant at all costs. Lung on the other hand is prepared to lend a hand by dealing with these thugs his way. That's the story in a nutshell until Lung faces Chuck Norris in a last battle in the Colliseum of Rome.I have difficulties to believe reviews that say that this is the best Kung Fu movie ever made. Because its got nothing worth seeing except for Lee's funny battle with two nun-chucks. The rest seems just questionably wrong. It starts off with Lee waiting at the airport while being constantly watched by an elderly women. Then he goes to a café to order food, but he can't even tell the waitress that he wants some eggs, although he speaks perfectly good English afterward in the rest of the movie. The peek of awkwardness comes of Lee asking at least three times in the movie where the toilet is. In the beginning I thought this rather to be a Jackie Chan comedy than a Bruce Lee Kung Fu movie. Oh yeah, he also asks the girl later if it was possible to buy a gun and she replies Oh yes, of course, everyone can buy a gun here! Say what now? That is Italy in the 1970's! Since when can anyone, yet alone tourists just buy a gun? What's more is that he never really goes to buy a gun. Instead he is making small darts out of light wood, which he later throws with high accuracy into the wrists of people being 5-15 meters away. Have you ever had a 10 cm stick in your hand? Even if you could lift 50 kg, you could never toss a stick like that further than 2 meters, yet alone pierce someones bone with them! Another example is that none of these gangsters that threaten the restaurant seems to be Italian. They've got blacks, Indians, Japanese and white Americans except for that one fat dude who screams Mamma Mia in one scene. At one other time the boss of the gang commands his underlings to take Lee outside of the restaurant to deal with him, but reminds them to be careful with the guns because of the open public. But every time they go outside of the restaurant in this movie, they go to the back ally behind the building where they are surrounded by 2 meter walls, so nobody can see them anyway! And when Lee finally finishes beating them up, the gang leader hires a Hit-man to snipe Lee down at night. But for some reason he is polite enough to send a message to the restaurant beforehand, placed inside a little nice coffin... What makes the situation worse is that the girl wants to protect Lee from being shot and recommends him over and over again to leave Rome at once, but for some reason never really tells him exactly why and that he will be killed if he doesn't leave.Another weird example is when the gangs' Japanese henchman is calling the worlds best fighter, who for some reason is an American. And he even tells the exchange through the telephone Give me America. Yes, you heard me right, America! WTF??? Then Lee and his restaurant friends have a big fight in the open area against an European and a Japanese karate fighter. But after Lee is done beating up the Japanese guy, his friends grab each of his arms and keep kicking him until he is... dead? I don't know, but that surely isn't what Kung Fu is all about. Lees master Yip Man would turn around in his grave if you would see this movie today. The weirdest plot twist occurs when the chef of the restaurant is stabbing Lees friends in the back only because he suddenly remembers that he wants to go back to Hong Kong. But that twist is never really further explained in the rest of the movie.The fight between Lee and Chuck Norris is a joke. Before they meet, Lee is running around for like 5 minutes in the whole damn Colliseum before they meet in some corridor. Then they face each other, stripping off their clothes to show their bare muscular bodies (but only showing Norris harry mess of a body). To make the audience wait even longer, they start warming up for about 5 more minutes. Then they start fighting and about 5 minutes later, Lee is breaking Norries neck and even seems regretting it all of a sudden. What the hell?? I didn't like this movie. The only two scenes I really liked was the one with the fat guy screaming Mamma Mia and the one where Lee is holding his quivering two fists and weaving is forefinger in front of the gang leader just to say No, no, no, you don't to that again. It's funny because the exact same scene is shown in the modern movie Kung Fu Hustle. Otherwise, this movie is a disappointment. I will watch the rest of his movies but I have no big expectations anymore. I give this movie 2 of 10.

But it has grown on me over the years and has become one of my favorite movies.Whether you like this movie or not - it will leave lasting impressions.
