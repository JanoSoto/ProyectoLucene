However, I researched a bit and found that there are at least two other versions out there--and possible more. In the 1930s, there was a Czechoslovakian filming of the story (the first) and then a British version as well. I also learned that all of these versions are different and not so bleak as the original story--a story where one of the partners in crime KILLS the other--only to learn that the jewels are not in any of the chairs. I could see how this version would be better for Soviet propaganda--but funny, no way. So the movie versions apparently have a more innocent and funnier slant--a good idea if you ask me.This Mel Brooks version is quite different from the Cuban one--much more slapstick, more cinematic and possessing much more energy. In fact, the lack of energy was my biggest complaint about the Cuban film. For a comedy, it was just too retrained. Here in the 1970 version, however, the opposite is true--at times the story has a bit too much energy and relies a bit too much on slapstick. For example, during a few scenes Brooks does something I HATE--speeds up the camera to indicate it's a funny scene. However, if it's funny, let it be funny on its own merit--don't do cheap camera tricks. Also, while adding a new character to the story was not necessarily a bad idea, Dom DeLuise's priest was, at times, over the top and didn't fit with the mood set by the rest of the film. Eliminating the camera tricks and keeping DeLuise under control would have improved the film immensely. Also, keeping Brooks out of the film completely wouldn't have hurt, either. I loved his writing and directing, but his best films had him barely in them (such as The Producers and Young Frankenstein).Now I have criticized the film quite a bit--but there is a lot to like and I think it's one of Brooks' better films. The most obvious plus in the film was the wild and crazy performance by Ron Moody. Because Moody had many quiet and restrained moments, his crazy scenes worked well. For example, while a generally restrained man, seeing him, out of the blue, climb up the pole to the high wire was hilarious. And, a few other times when he lost control, couldn't help but smile. RESTRAINT and selective craziness was what made him a joy to watch.I also respected the nice location shoot in Yugoslavia. It could have been made in the States but filming in a locale more like the USSR helped--and there was no way the Soviet Union would have allowed the film to be made there considering the state of US-USSR relations at the time. The color cinematography and locations shoots were nice.I was surprised, but Brooks' song Hope For The Best, Expect The Worst was also a wonderful song. It was catchy, summed up the film well and I found myself humming it after the movie was over.Finally, I liked the relationship between Moody and Frank Langella--particularly at the end of the movie. Going for a sentimental ending with some pathos was a great idea--and ending it like the novel would have been just awful.Overall, while I am sure many would disagree, I think that apart from The Producers and Young Frankenstein this was Brooks' best film. There is a likability and subtle (at times) that you just never see in his later films...and I like this and find it endearing. Too bad his films became progressively goofier and self-indulgent.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"19 April 2011","score":"","review":" If you look at Jim Carrey's career, he had been around for nearly 15 years before Ace Ventura came along, doing voice and small featured parts. Ace Ventura was his first solo lead. It was also the first opportunity for him to go into zaniness overdrive, mixing a wide variety of outrageousnesses into his performance - costume, dialogue, delivery, hair, body language, and face pulling (or gurning as we call it here in the UK).Credit where credit is due - it worked brilliantly. Ace Ventura Pet Detective is an immensely entertaining film, and I am happy to recommend it highly. It has a decent story, and a bravura (and very funny) performance from Carrey.It put Carrey on the map. Not a bad thing. What it also did was make him the go-to guy for zany face-pulling parts. This worked a treat as far as The Mask (Carrey's immediate follow-up) was concerned this was an even better vehicle for his brand of physical outrageousness. Dumb And Dumber followed, upping the ante even more.But then Carrey delivered a similarly mannered performance in Batman Forever, and it was the wrong performance in the wrong film. Three further movies followed cut from the same cloth, with diminishing returns (Liar, Liar wasn't bad). It wasn't until the straight role in The Truman Show that Carrey shook loose of the Ace Ventura legacy.Don't let that stop you seeing Ace Ventura Pet Detective, though!
