Honestly, are there any other films that are quite so heavy-handed, poorly executed and mind numbingly dull as Stone's turgid 'satire'? I can't think of many &#150; it certainly must rank amongst the worst films of the 90s.Of all the things I hate about the film, it's Mickey and Mallory themselves that I hate the most, especially as the film loves them. I mean, as much as the film tries to be a clever comment on the violence obsessed media, the film, despite itself, idolises these two losers &#150; murders are filmed in slow-motion and different film stocks, and their love is portrayed as honest and true. Compare this with everyone else &#150; all the other characters are liars, schemers and scumbags. But while any right thinking individual would have nothing but contempt for all of these characters, Stone allows Mickey and Mallory to come out clean at the other end. What a load of rubbish.One of the most infuriating scenes in the film is when Mickey and Mallory go and visit an Indian. He talks gibberish for a while and then Mickey appears to go to sleep (I can't blame him; the scene strains for meaning in every frame and fails at every turn). Then while Mickey's sleeping he has a nightmare about being abused as a kid. However, when he wakes up, Mickey kills the Indian. Mallory's response is one of horror, saying, 'You killed life. He fed us.' Let it be noted that this is the only murder that Mickey and Mallory feel really bad about. And the only reason they feel bad about it is because the Indian gave them something. The lesson to be learnt here, so Mickey and Mallory appear to be saying, is that it's fine to kill people and not feel bad about it if they do nothing for you.But that scene touches on another annoying element in the film &#150; childhood abuse. Of course it's a fact that most violent people have been either been abused or have come from a violent upbringing, but the film gives us that and nothing else &#150; oh, they were abused, that's why they're the way they are, it all makes sense. What a load of crap.And all the segments to do with childhood are completely removed for reality. For example, Mallory's childhood is filmed like a sitcom, with laughs in the background as daddy feels his daughter up. But rather than be a clever comment on the corrupting influence of television, the sequence is so over the top that it feels like petulant whining. Boo hoo, daddy felt my bum. Look what he made me into. Again it's a gross oversimplification. And the burning of Mallory's mother is ridiculous. You were abused, too, and you did nothing to save me. Therefore you deserve to be burnt to bits. What the&#133;? But despite all this, the film still tries to make us feel sorry for Mickey and Mallory. Just take the scene where the two of them get arrested. Mallory gets the crap beaten out of her and Mickey gets tasered before getting beaten up himself. But rather than weep tears at the excessive Rodney King-style police brutality, I could only think that the two deserved more punishment. They deserved a severe beating followed by a bullet in the brain. But alas the film never gave me this satisfaction, thus making it even more painful for me to watch.However, the film did at least give me the satisfaction of seeing Mallory get maced. That was fun. And it's rather telling that while the film wants us to love the two mass murderers, it's the sleazy journalist, the evil cop and the wicked prison warden who are the most likable. And they're likable because, unlike Mickey and Mallory, they're not full of pious, sanctimonious BS. They're scum and they know it. But Mickey and Mallory are always justifying their actions, always claiming to be pure when they're anything but. It's infuriating.Also annoying is Stone's filming style. He's obviously snorted too much blow and watched too many music videos, because the film uses different film stocks, skewed angles, stock footage and front and rear projection to nauseating effect. It's a mess. But of course, Stone probably thinks it's making a wonderful comment on the sensory overload that is present in our multi-channel, television obsessed culture. But no, the film has nothing intelligent to say about television, as anyone with half a brain knows that the masses are glued to the idiot box and that crass, ratings-obsessed journalists do nothing but desensitise the people who watch them. (A ridiculous detail in the film is when Mickey and Mallory visit the Indian. 'Too much TV' is projected onto them. It strains for profundity, but it ends up as being a visual trick more suited to a pretentious R.E.M. or Radiohead video.) However, to briefly defend the film, I will say that Robert Downey Jr. is quite funny in parts (Tommy Lee Jones and Tom Sizemore also provide a couple of chortles, even though they play two-dimensional grotesques). And there's a segment in 'American Maniacs' that gave me a laugh. But what Stone doesn't realise is that the reality is even more ridiculous. Just watch World's Wildest Police Videos with Sheriff John Bunnell. Wayne Gale is tame in comparison, and nowhere near as disturbing or amusing.

While at a meeting that takes place in a beautiful resort, he meets a wealthy stranger, Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin), who befriends him. Both Dell and George, Joe's friend and an attorney for the corporation, urge Joe to pin down his boss for compensation for the invention now and not wait. Jimmy suggests there may be a hole in his contract.What I have just described isn't really the plot - it just seems that way. Mamet has written a fascinating, suspenseful drama with dizzying twists and turns. If you're familiar with another wonderful Mamet film, House of Games (costarring yet another of his wives, Lindsay Crouse) you'll be able to figure some of this out, though probably not all.All Mamet films have a certain detachment and staginess about them. These actors all underplay their roles - sometimes they're a little too natural. As Bette Davis said, Today's actors are realistic, but real acting is larger than life. You get the point when you watch this. But I can't say it detracts at all from the film - I think, in fact, this naturalness and remote quality keeps your interest on the plot instead of getting overly involved with the characters. And this is one heck of a plot-driven film.As Joe Ross, the young man who finds his invention bringing him not money but trouble, Campbell Scott is totally internalized, only allowing himself a slight smile from time to time. You can never quite tell what he's thinking - is he interested in Susan (Rebecca Pidgeon) or not? Does he know more of what is going on than we do, or is he as out of it as the audience? You don't know. And you're not supposed to know. Everything about Rebecca Pidgeon is odd, but you can find that character in any office - smarter than her job calls for and a little awkward and off-putting in her overtness. With her strange looks and affected voice and manner (May I be your Queen? she asks Ross) she comes off as one of those intellectual types who throws herself at guys who are never interested in her. She draws just the right amount of attention to herself. Ben Gazzara in a bad toupee is the harried boss; Huffman has a small role and because of her recent success, she seems wasted. But her role is important. Ricky Jay is a teddy bear as George.And Steve Martin - well, he's no Pink Panther here and no wild and crazy guy, but he is a handsome man of mystery. As an extraordinarily wealthy wheeler-dealer, he wines, dines and whispers in the ear of Joe Ross. Then there's his mysterious sister that he wants to fix up with Joe. What's he all about - see for yourself. By the time we come to the last scenes in the film, you won't have any idea of anything, believe me. And you'll love it.As far as I'm concerned, Mamet writes best in this genre; I'm not a huge fan of Glengarry Glen Ross, for example, but I do love this.

What we witness in his final appearance in the film's final scene is Grant now positioned above the skeleton, which lies in ruins on the floor below him. These images nicely parallel the journey of Grant's character, scientist David Huxley, throughout the film.

This, coupled with the carefree antics of its central characters, make the film a perfect specimen of the cherished escapism of the time. This isn't to say it doesn't hold up well today.

It not only manages to equal the original, but surpass it in many ways. The first Frankenstein film was quite terrifying in its time, but may seem a bit dated to viewers today. It still remains a great film however. Bride of Frankenstein ups the shock value of the first film and adds a campy sense of humor, something which was very ahead of its time. Many films that attempt to combine humor with horror manage to be neither funny nor scary (just look at the recent Scream series for an example). James Whales for some reason got the idea right with both this and The Invisible Man. The humor simply catches the viewer off guard. Also, this is one of the most humane horror films ever made. The Monster is both terrifying yet sympathetic all the same, even more so than in the first film. The scene of him and the blind man is still one of the most touching and heartbreaking sequences ever in a film. Also, unlike Dracula, this film never creeks and is rapidly paced and always entertaining.The performance of Boris Karloff is one of the greatest in cinema history. As I said above, Karloff manages to be both intimidating and sympathetic and does so with very little dialog (a great feat for any actor). Ernest Thesiger is memorable as the evil Dr. Pretorius, a witty scientist with a few weaknesses. This remains my favorite mad doctor portrayal. In her two brief roles as the bride and Mary Shelly in the campy prologue, Elsa Lanchester creates an impression. Colin Clive and Valerie Hobson are passable as the Frankensteins, but their co-stars are so great you can hardly complain. Look for brief roles by cult favorites Una O'Connor (The Invisible Man), Dwight Frye (Renfield in Dracula), and even a young John Carradine. The direction by Whales is always superb. He manages to combine the strange set design and camera angles of the German expressionists yet adds an unique flavor all the same.

It's a work that is low-key even as it's insanely zany in spurts and totally tuned into a comedic frequency that only works for the casual viewer sometimes. But even a lesser work from the likes of Michel Gondry and Kaufman registers higher in a way that comedies with lower ambitions couldn't dream to aspire to. It has some conventionality to it, with its love triangle between Dr. Nathan Bronfman (Tim Robbins), Lila (Patricia Arquette), and Gabrielle (Miranda Otto) that ends up tearing apart the characters to question who they are (aside from Gabrielle). Yet that's not really totally at concern, though it probably has somewhere to figure into the whole idea of what makes for truth in human nature. One might argue, after seeing the film, it has something to do with individualism...actually, if we go by Kaufman's interpretation, it has to do with orgasms.Told in quasi-Rashomon style (with the law and the afterlife, as in Rashomon, figuring into Human Nature as well), Bronfman has an interest in teaching mice table manners when we first meet him (one of the film's funniest recurring images\/scenes), and gets set up on a date with Lila, who's a writer of nature stories (from personal experience, due to an abnormal hair condition as a child she decides to live in the wild after an unsuccessful stint at a side-show). She decides to conform for him, hiding the fact that she's a hairy ape from the wild, as he hides his compulsion for manners and proper behavior. Enter in Puff (Rhys Ifans, in one of his funniest roles\/performances yet), who gets that name by Gabrielle, Nathan's assistant at work, and an adoptive mother to Nathan being adoptive father. Now it will be time to really go further with Nathan's research- to teach one who's been in the wild always to be a proper, educated human. This proves to be a challenge, as Puff can't resist the urge to hump whenever aroused, and is around the sexual explosion that erupts between Nathan and Gabrielle- the love triangle that unfolds that may spell as foreshadowing for Puff later on in the story...And so on. You might get just the slight sense- scratch that, overwhelming impression- that this is not you're average tale of what it means to be an ape-man and become 'civlized'. It's a whacked-out comedy of manners and sexuality, where one's own soul becomes more of a question then what is really meant to be proper or what not. Actually, there is some interest in how Nathan figures into this as well- he's the least human of all, at least for the most part, as he loses himself in his pursuit of science, with Lila losing hers alongside. So Kaufman does end up working some very interesting characters here, and the situations and little notes that pop up are about as irreverent as he's ever done. The problem is it ends up un-even too little things are left un-checked, as to Gabrielle possibly not being really French (it's put in as a possible note of her being untruthful as well, but it's never addressed again, or her motives of anything, even as Otto plays the character well enough), or the psychology that emerges from Puff himself. Does he just want to have some of that as he says to the committee, or does he get too adjusted to his surroundings.However what holes or problems might lie in the screenplay, there's no denying the bright strengths just in general working in Human Nature. Who would think up such a strange concept, leaping bravely off of Truffaut's Wild Child into a sort of common theme in Kaufman's work so far? Kaufman would, especially as it's part of the need to feel like someone else, or what it must be to try to be something one can't really be through insecurities and troubles in dealing with reality and surroundings. I would imagine that Kaufman had a lot of fun churning this one out, possibly even thinking it might be improbable it might even get made. Luckily, it's directed by Gondry with his mix of fantastical visual energy and a real sense of humility with the absurd material. It doesn't have the same power as in his best work either, but as a first feature film it could've been a lesser endeavor too. Human Nature ends on an (ironically?) unique ending, where Puff does what we'd expect him to do, but then maybe not, and it caps off what has led up to it- a weird little ball of comic-curiosity that should please fans of Robbins (very funny in his awkward doctor character), Arquette, and especially Ifans.

While DPS was an interesting development of a standard situation (a liberal-minded teacher helps students free their minds from tradition through creative literature) the Truman Show is based on a very unique setup. The main character, Truman Burbank, is the only true man in a TV-show world of actors and commercial advertising. We, the viewers, discover this truth before he does because Weir introduces us to a selection of viewers who are hooked on the show.

But to turn the film into a religious allegory misses the obvious the film is about the line between fake and real, and how television destroys humanity by hooking us on images in order to sell products.

The main character, Truman Burbank, is the only true man in a TV-show world of actors and commercial advertising. We, the viewers, discover this truth before he does because Weir introduces us to a selection of viewers who are hooked on the show. The film holds our interest by showing us, first, Truman's process of discovery, and then his attempts to escape his situation.A lot has been made out of the supposed religious elements of the Truman Show, presumably because of the Christof-Christ name parallel (a bit too cute, don't you think?). But to turn the film into a religious allegory misses the obvious the film is about the line between fake and real, and how television destroys humanity by hooking us on images in order to sell products. The key line in the film is (Truman to Christof) You never had a camera in my head! You can't say that about God. Second, the real Christ was a rebel (as in the confrontation with the money-changers) who was killed by the system. If you want a Christ image in the Truman Show, it's Truman walking on water at the end of the film, not the lord of commercialism chillingly played by Ed Harris.If there's a deeper philosophical message in the film, it has to be the rejection of the postmodern idea of how we know what we know. Truman lives in a world that's been created for him. A postmodernist (i.e., pretty much anyone teaching in the literature or history department of my university) would say that we accept the world we're given. What we know to be true is what we are told is true. My truth depends entirely on the culture I live in and the categories of thought I'm provided with. On this basis, Truman should never escape Seahaven. But human intellect and curiosity exist precisely to question and change categories of thought. So, Truman's quest for the truth involves observing both anomalies (a falling stage light, odd patches of rain) where there should be consistency, and patterns (bicycle, flowers, Beetle!) where there should be randomness. He persists until he finds a way out of the world of image into the real world, out of the fake light, sky and clouds into the black door of whatever is out there. The tragedy is that the commercial world of television needs us not to find our way out. So the very last image of the Truman Show is not the hero escaping, but the viewers saying, So, what else is on?

Sure it doesn't have the humor or quick pacing of some of his other works, but its one of the most fascinatingly symbolic movies ever made. Vertigo requires multiple viewings to fully understand. Some have complained about the slow pacing, but its never boring. Its such an intelligently designed and layered experience that I was always captivated by it. Not to mention the fact it has two great lead performances from James Stewart (managing to be unlikeable yet sympathetic all the same) and Kim Novac (icy cold and incredibly sexy) and a memorable score from the great Bernard Herrmann.Its also Hitchcock's most thematically disturbing film, which is quite a feat considering his status as the master of suspense. James Stewart's character John 'Scottie' Ferguson has obsessions bordering on necrophilia, something which still remains quite a taboo topic. Hitchcock managed to explore this sickness in a subtle manner and still made Ferguson into a sympathetic character. Its one of his most personal and complex films. Some have complained about how he gives away the twist ending of the film. It may be a bit of a fault, but than you are more able to concentrate on the psychological implications of the story.

Ida Lupino's tough little programmer about two men, Roy Collins & Gilbert Bowen(Edmond O'Brien & Frank Lovejoy)who pick up killer Emmett Myers(William Talman, who is really intense and creepy in this role;very effective portrayal of a remorseless monster). He holds them captive with a pistol always in his hand. Control is his drug and wielding his weapon brings a rush he often parlays through mind-games..especially with Collins who is more fragile than tough-minded Bowen who is able to keep his mind centered on their freedom at the right moment of surprise. This film follows them through the Mexican desert and mountainous plain(the location work is as much a reason why this film is so successful as the very good leads)while we wonder how our unfortunate captives will or will not survive. A little eerie touch to the film is that Talman's Myers has an eye that doesn't shut so at night it makes it harder for our heroes to determine whether or not he's asleep.Above everything this film is a psychological thriller between psychopath and his hostages. He relishes having them under his power with no real way to escape without harming one or the other. Collins and Bowen could easily betray each other's trust and run for it, but this film shows the character they have. They are flawed people(as Myers often pokes at them..why didn't they go to Arizona like they were supposed to?)who are faced with this ever-growing knowledge that at anytime he could kill them. That tension is really what makes this film so very good. The trials of the place they inhabit is also a major theme as that harsh sun and dust beats down on them after their car goes on the fritz. They are always having to elude capture because of that blasted gun aiming for their bodies.We also see how the Mexican police cooperate with US authorities to find Myers..that is also showed by Lupino is great detail. The film is thrilling to watch..Lupino really made a humdinger of a film here. The three leads really only bring an added professionalism to this film making it more than just a cheap B-film.

Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) travels to the Senate to settle the conflict and she's protected by two Jedi knights arrogant master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his faithful apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor).Their ship having broken down, they stop upon planet Tatooine to fix it and they meet young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a Miles Prower-like mechanical wizard who builds robots and racing pods. Qui-Gon is impressed with the boy's powers and is convinced that Anakin could become a powerful Jedi.Some nostalgic fans of this franchise would tell you that some lines of the movie are funny to hear.

I know that it is tough because of the series' prestige. And some comparisons with the older episodes are essential for the rating scale.I explain myself. The special effects are very abundant (almost too much), the sets are very imposing and the non-human characters have a greater roster than the real actors. The major difference between 1977 and 1999 is how everything is done.Director George Lucas is perhaps the greatest special effects wizard of all time and Episode I might be the ideal playground to show what's he able to do with all of his high-tech toys.

Using a computer is at the same time so difficult and so easy.But essentially, watching many epic action scenes and FX-laden spectacles can only convince us that this hi-tech stuff is well-appreciated by everybody.The exotic locations are very impressive and so are the CGI-created characters, such as the massive droid army and the Gungan people. Jar Jar Binks is funny, but his slightly incomprehensible dialect is a considerable flaw.It's the action scenes which deserve my best regards.

Talking about Darth Maul, his make-up is very well done and it comforts for his lack of speech.The bar was very high for this movie.

An abandoned 5-star, world-class super-liner designed to carry hundreds of wealthy passengers. There's sure to be riches to plunder and a quick trip down to the Purser's Office (the idiot who chose to die in the first) might save Jenny from the banks greedy hands.'Doctor' Stefan Svevo (trying saying that while drunk) and his group of suspicious men dressed in impeccably white clothes follow Turner inside, hoping to save some remaining survivors. Yeah right! Svevo just happens to be after a secret cargo of guns and plutonium and has an agent still stuck on-board.Turner and his crew find the Purser's safe quite easy and load up on the loot. But they also find a bunch of stranded passengers including a very young-looking Peter Boyle, Slim Pickens, Mark Harmon and Jack Warden as a blind writer. His quick trip to pinch the riches turns into the much more noble task of leading the rest to safety. But once they discover Svevo's plot a fight breaks out.I think that BTPA has had an unfair amount of criticism. Until the 2006 DVD release the film suffered 27 years of pan and scan TV screenings and videos, which completely screws up the scope photography. Seeing the film in widescreen, as intended, gives it a much slicker look. But I wasn't too impressed with the set-decoration and lighting. The Poseidon was already trashed and unstable before the first survivors escaped. By now it should be seriously threatening to sink or explode and the sets should reflect how much stress the ship is under. But they do look too spotless and the lighting is too bright and un-atmospheric. And, just so you know, a ship of this size would have more than one kitchen. So moans about it 'already being flooded' are invalid.And I do think that the ending is kind of abrupt and rushed. It was a bit of a let-down having finish with such a lame, flippant finale. And, despite, previous criticisms, I do think that the characters are just as good as before. I felt sorry for Jack Warden when his wife died, or when Michael Caine realised that he lost the gold. Wilbur (Karl Malden) was a good character too and I think that his exit from the film was less than what he deserved. There is also more continuity with the original than the negative reviews proclaim. So don't let that put you off.It's had a bad reputation, but BTPA isn't as bad as pretentious movie zealots would have you think. If you are a fan of the original then it is at least worth a rental.

Once there however, Karen is unsettled by the neurotic community, the creepy woods, and the possibility that Eddie may still be alive ...I love werewolf movies, and I think my favourite is The Howling, because every element of it is so enjoyable. John Sayles' script is both witty and scary, the special effects are sensational, the big ensemble cast are a terrific bunch of weirdos, and the photography and direction are both top-notch. For me, the acid test of this kind of movie is the monster, and make-up effects genius Rob Bottin creates fabulous, cartoon-inspired, hairy, snarling, bipedal, fanged horrors straight out of Little Red Riding Hood. They are terrifying, absurd and visually stunning; there is a moment where Balaski pulls a paper file from a drawer and a werewolf hand enters screen right and delicately plucks it from her which is one the most deliciously scary horror movie moments ever done. I also love the way this film is all over the place thematically; the first fifteen minutes come on like a sleazy urban nightmare, then it turns into an adult fairy-tale. It plays as a straight horror flick but it's also an absurd satire of TV news, self-help therapy and communal living. Wallace's intense, straight-as-an-arrow performance should be at odds with the sly jokes and outrageous situations, but it's not - it just all gels seamlessly. She's backed up by an amazing support cast - Balaski is just sensational as the intrepid Terry, Brooks is every teenage boy's fantasy come true and her last line is a corker. Macnee, McCarthy, Miller and Pickens are lovable old pros, Picardo is unforgettable as the depraved killer and the iconic Carradine is terrific in one of his last great roles (the first shot of him is fabulous). And don't miss Sayles' cameo as a dogmatic morgue attendant. Dante directs with an assured combination of technical prowess, classic horror suspense and shocking imagery, pulling the very best movie possible from all the tools at his disposal. The showpiece werewolf transformation scene is truly stunning, but the movie is full of action, suspense, evocative shots, amusing observations and hair-raising moments. John Hora's camera-work is dynamic and dreamlike, exactly the right mix of light and shade to squeeze the emotion out of each scene. I adore monster movies, and this is one of the best; though some have come close (David Thewlis in Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban), nobody for me has yet bettered the lovely lycanthropes in this picture.

As for those who dismissed it as a tale about love, loss and revenge, these themes are minute compared to the overwhelming issue that is raised in the film. When Alexis kills his first victim we are shocked, as is Fernando. 'Que hiciste?' he asks him, when he returns from shooting the punk rocker next door. But as the film progresses and we witness countless murders the viewer becomes anaesthetised (sorry if i spelt that wrong im only 18 and not great with words!) to the horror of these increasingly violent and pointless murders. It is only when Fernando is about to shoot the injured dog that we are disturbed by the violence. What does this tell you? The director has led the viewers to a state of moral panic! Suddenly the sights of human death do not trouble us but we are moved at the euthanasia of a dog! As for the poor acting.. there is only one professional actor in this entire movie, the director made the correct decision by choosing real street gang members, real people who live in the streets of Medellin. How on earth can you use a professional actor with probably no experience of any real danger into Medellin and ask him to understand the idea of 'life as a commodity'. If you have seen The Rose Seller 'The Vendedora de Las Rosas' you will see just how crucial it is to use these real people. The protagonist in The Rose Seller (Leidy Tabares) has a real life story much more violent and gruesome than her tragic story in the film as a 13yr old glue-sniffing rose seller.This film is awesome, (if a little long) it shows how the institution of the Church has completely failed, as it is now used for drug exchange and other illegal activities. The homosexuality plays no significant part in the film as the couple are never marginalised by their orientation, on the other hand it is as if homosexuality is an expression of their masculinity.Anyway... im feeling rather angry that no one really understood this movie apart from the few people who have made some really interesting comments.

He'd had hardly any experience previous to this film and thinking back to the film itself; it's no wonder it really turned out the way it did. A big budget and a big cast with a screenplay that wasn't terrible probably demanded a bigger and better director. I could kick around a few names like 'John Woo' but I won't get too into that.Fatally, The Specialist doesn't do right what it's supposed to do right. The camera work is bad (I actually spotted one instance of camera shake in this film), the fight scenes are poorly choreographed and badly executed, the dialogue is a bit iffy at best and is rather clichéd at times and the stereotypes of Colombian drug lords are laughable. With the action scenes, the extras just sit up waiting to be hit and are poorly put together in a way that you can see Stallone's next move as he wins the punch-up from a beaten position. The dialogue put across via the recorded phone messages feels forced and they snap back at one another too quickly. The character played by Rod Stieger is a little too stereotypical and his pronunciation of the word 'you' like 'jew' can only be taken seriously for so long before a serious scene involving intense dialogue is broken up by a smirk here and there.What makes the film also rather cheesy is the editing at some points. Early on in the film, a character threatens Stallone at knife point and asks him a question. Cut to a reaction shot of a silent Stallone and immediately, the character asks the question again &#150; not even giving Stallone the time it takes to blink to reply. This was very noticeable and good editing, as they say, is un-noticeable. One other incident is where Stallone sneaks up on a pistol wielding guard during a hotel evacuation and knocks him out from behind in the lobby area. We keep on the same camera and pan as he runs away. From this, we see that for the entire time, people (extras) have been running right past, merely feet from the assault and don't even batter an eyelid at what just happened as Stallone runs off in the OPPOSITE direction.Every action film has its effects and this films' was poor. The blatant blue screen effect of the water getting closer and closer via the window as the suite breaks off the side of the hotel and falls to the sea as a guy waves frantically at the camera crashing towards him without trying to get away really brought out a long shake of the head from me. The fact when one of the bombs went off in the room, one guy fell down before the other was also laughable. These are the action scenes of the film and should be suspenseful and nerve-wracking &#150; not humorous, instead.If you're looking for a decent Stallone action-based film from the mid-nineties, avoid this and see 'Assassins' instead.

The character played by Rod Stieger is a little too stereotypical and his pronunciation of the word 'you' like 'jew' can only be taken seriously for so long before a serious scene involving intense dialogue is broken up by a smirk here and there.What makes the film also rather cheesy is the editing at some points. Early on in the film, a character threatens Stallone at knife point and asks him a question. Cut to a reaction shot of a silent Stallone and immediately, the character asks the question again &#150; not even giving Stallone the time it takes to blink to reply. This was very noticeable and good editing, as they say, is un-noticeable. One other incident is where Stallone sneaks up on a pistol wielding guard during a hotel evacuation and knocks him out from behind in the lobby area. We keep on the same camera and pan as he runs away. From this, we see that for the entire time, people (extras) have been running right past, merely feet from the assault and don't even batter an eyelid at what just happened as Stallone runs off in the OPPOSITE direction.Every action film has its effects and this films' was poor. The blatant blue screen effect of the water getting closer and closer via the window as the suite breaks off the side of the hotel and falls to the sea as a guy waves frantically at the camera crashing towards him without trying to get away really brought out a long shake of the head from me. The fact when one of the bombs went off in the room, one guy fell down before the other was also laughable. These are the action scenes of the film and should be suspenseful and nerve-wracking &#150; not humorous, instead.If you're looking for a decent Stallone action-based film from the mid-nineties, avoid this and see 'Assassins' instead. That film's particularly large cast rivals this one and the direction and script are a lot better.

There has been a backlash against this picture, mostly for two reasons; it was not Star Wars, and it was not what people expected of Star Trek.If you put these expectations aside, and if you also have some attention span and willingness to relax into a picture this is a remarkable experience. I often here people use words like boring, too long etc. Well yes, if we are expecting a quick-hit, film that can be digested in 90 minutes like a TV show, this is not that type of film. If we apply these standards to Lawrence of Arabia, 2001, Blade Runner, Bridge on the River Kwai, or Citzen Kane (which Robert Wise edited, none of these films would have ever been made.If you put Star Trek The Motion Picture in context of it's scale and the craftsman involved you start to appreciate it's quality and elegance. Robert Wise does not need qualification. He brings an elegance and texture to work and life in space that StarWars has not put to screen to this day.Star Wars even now seems like nothing more than an impressive exercise in effects and sound. It is always reminding us that it is a movie. ST-TMP on other hand departed into an immersive experience developed by Robert Wise, with the amazing talents of Doug Trumbull and John Dykstra, and the enormous contibutions of Jerry Goldsmith. Likewise, the photography, the scale of the sets and the editing of the film all contribute to a immersive world that saturates the viewer into the film.You gain a lot of knowledge and appreciation of this film and the experience that they achieved by watching the Director's Edition DVD and listening to Wise, Trumbull, Dykstra, Goldsmith and others discuss the production. This was a uniquely creative and enormous effort, and considering the technological limitations, the demands of the studio, and the many demands of the Star Trek Bible that qualified the creation of the movie. I am pleased to see that other reviewers here have come to appreicate this movie many years later. I encourage the skeptics to find the time to relax and watch it on the biggest screen you can find.

The sets, the costumes and the scenes are just like a big budget movie. It is impressive that they got a nice budget for a gay film! Another striking thing is that there are two big mainstream stars in the move Lisa Kudrow and Christina Ricci. Lisa Kudrow's role is small and dispensible, which is a pity as it is not everyday that a mainstream star agrees to star in a gay film. Christina Ricci's role is more substantial, but still dispensible. I particularly applaud Ricci because it is not the first time she stars in a gay related film that I watched, the other being The Laramie Project.The plot itself is quite complex, with the main story with two small side plots about the two main characters telling their story to other people. A typical romantic comedy has a join-split-join setting, and yet in this film there are more split and joins that I almost lost track.It is a refreshing film, entertaining and fun. However, it is forgettable and does not leave a big impression in viewers' hearts.
