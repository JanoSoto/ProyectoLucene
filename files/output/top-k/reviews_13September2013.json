I remember the first time seeing it and thinking to myself that was a damn good movie. Keep in mind, I was half my age too. Even with still being a horror fan since childhood, I can easily say I don't know how the hell I liked this film the first time around considering it almost put me to sleep at about the midpoint of its running time.My biggest gripe with this Halloween rip-off (I'm quoting the director people!), is the pacing. I kid you not, there are shots of absolutely nothing filling the screen and they can run as long as five minutes. If you were to actually compile all the deaths and fights\/mayhem into one movie, it'd be as long as a Youtube video.Now I'm one for character development, but these characters are some of the most unlikable people I've come across. You have your genre staples, okay I get it's a run-of-the-mill slasher, but never have I suffered this much through such wooden acting. Is it bad to say I really didn't care the final girl either?And what is up with everyone saying the kills are tremendous. If you blink, you'll miss it! Not only did the MPAA butcher the hell out of these scenes, an axe to the face is hardly what I call trend-setting. Why do I think Friday the 13th retained its notoriety? For one, the clever plot twist. I might have my gripes with the pacing\/characters, but one thing is that out of all the by-the-number slasher plots, this one mixes up the formula just enough to give you a taste of something new. Also, while this film is touted for its kills, it actually racks up some decent tension in its early kills. Is it embarrassing to say I was actually on the edge of my seat at some parts? And lastly, the ending. It may be a cliffhanger, but again, it's a smart one at that. What do I think would make Friday the 13th even more of a classic? Get a new editor, fight with the MPAA until you get rights to your kills, and hire a new cast. Oh right, they did that with the new remake. Strangely enough, they're both the same (quality-wise). Well, I guess no matter if you re-make Jason, pit him against Freddy, this is just one story that (so far) has not bode well from script to silver screen. What a shame.

Granted, I don't recall much of the Chamberlain Bourne from 1980's, but out of all these new ones (including Bourne legacy) I clearly like this one the most. Here are the reasons why1) This is easily the most emotionally appealing Jason Bourne out of all three of this trilogy. There is more depth and sincerity in his struggles, and he isn't yet too seasoned and determined as he is in the sequels. Matt Damon gives a very good performance.2) This movie focuses on the essential. It isn't trying to be smarter than it is. This isn't a movie about CIA spy programs and conspiracies as much as it is about Jason Bourne. This approach makes the movie more relatable, more exciting and more effective in every way.3) Wonderful cast. Casting was never a problem in the sequels either, but I like the actors in this one the most. Clive Owen, Chris Cooper, Franka Potente. Good job from each and every one of them.4) Execution. I love most of the scenes in this movie for two reasons they are just long enough to tell you that certain part of the story and maintain the suspense - never longer. When there's action, it's not only exciting but you actually see what's happening. Example one confrontation with Clive Owen's character. It doesn't really take that long, but it's effective and suspenseful from start to finish. It doesn't get tedious or repetitive and it tells you every bit of the story you need to know. Maximum effectiveness. Example two the fight scene in the apartment. It's inventive and exciting, but not only that you see what's going on. While the sequels went a little crazy with the shaky-cam, this one includes enough shots from steady, different angles to a) keep you in the middle of the action and b) let you see the big picture as well. This is easily one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen, even if the sound effects are a little overblown. 5) Violence. I'm not a gore fan, but these are not (nor should they be) kids' movies. Some of the action really has an impact on you. When someone gets hurt, you feel it.That's pretty much it. This is simply an effective movie it's paced perfectly, the cast is wonderful, action is thrilling and the more personal focus on the main character seals the deal. The sequels never came even close. They're not as bad as their hideous visual style (Greengrass hates my eyes), but they chose the path of messier and less appealing storytelling, tedious action and general shallowness. Soundtrack-wise the sequels got the upper hand in my mind, but that's it. I'm not exactly a fan of director Doug Liman, but he did such a fine job with this film and I would've wanted him to direct the sequels too.I'm writing this review now, because I just got this movie in a blu-ray format (universal 100th anniversary something edition) and I thought I might as well write a review, even though I've had this film on DVD for many years. I'd like to compliment the product itself this is how blu-rays should be made. Straight from the menus you know that there's been some effort. Plenty of stuff, bonuses and extras too.

As soon as the main b*tch was walking through the airport I knew I was again in for the stupid light bulb bullsh*t. He can take his red, green, blue, purple etc. bulbs and shove them up his *ss. I think there's a torture porn video of a guy breaking glass in his rectum and there's no doubt in my mind that it was somehow influenced by his hate for the visionary lighting skills of Dario Argento. Except for that, the opening scene made it seem like this might actually be a good film. Good use of the camera, editing and location....same for Inferno with the underwater scene. The filming from the trees was pretty good too (besides the shitty flood light) but it all turned to C grade horror during the 1st murder. The b*tch is screaming about a murderer even though she can't get in the room to see what's happening. There's a hairy arm smushing the other c*nt's face on the window? Maybe the arm belonged to the hairy monster in The Lords of Salem.In grade school I used to build gory sets in the entrance of our house every Halloween and the paint blood I used looked pretty similar to Argento's paint blood... I'd like to think my sets were scarier than Argento's because they probably were. Speaking of sets, they were suppose to be the best thing about this film and I've seen numerous people say how psychedelic they were. N*gger please. You can actually see places on the walls where they didn't put even layers of paint. They were also using acrylic (doesn't reflect light) and enamel (reflects light) black paint on some of the walls. Light reflecting paint actually looks natural and I think that's what he wanted but I guess they must've f*cked that up somehow or ran out and had to use the cheap stuff. The railing looked like Styrofoam spray painted with gold...terrible. Lesson gold spray paint does not make an object look like polished brass. Speaking of the railing...why were there windows around it? That wall was just 'there' even though it had nothing to do with the foundation of the building if you looked at it from the outside. Anyway, the rest of the set had a high school play quality to it and many of the hand painted designs were probably painted by high school kids. However, that doesn't mean this movie was better than a high school play...One of the funniest parts was the pointless and non-nonsensical killing of blind Adam Sandler by his own German Shepherd. Or did it kill him because he had some raw meat on his neck...? Hopefully one day they'll address this point in an ultra deluxe Criterion blu-ray release. What else? The maggots... totally visionary.

When I was a little kid I decided to get myself stuck in a slinky during nap time at a babysitter's house but she walked in before I got out. I had my *ss whooped so it brings back the fear.Why is that Austrian woman smiling all the time? Are her teeth bleached? How can she teach ballet when she uses a cane? Mysteries, mysteries.Then there's the whole dubbing English over Italians mouthing English words thing... Bat sh*t insane. Just speak Italian and subtitle it. There would've been much more time left over to fix the many other problems in the film. But oh well, what can you do? All in all I cannot see Dario as a visionary even in the slightest sense. The man does not possess the skill set for film making. At best, he's just some guy who has never been good at anything in his life but somehow managed to acquire enough money to make movies.

It certainly starts that way, but the movie is not like that.After a while, when the plot expands a little more, you find that the white dude that comes to greet his Chicano friends is a halfbreed American Mexican who hates his white father and considers himself brown on the inside. He is also on parole and only days until he gets to be 18 and be totally free. Then he makes a stupid move. Now you think it is going to be one of those prison movies, with the misguided youth and the corrupt system. Perhaps he is going to go to prison and beat up everybody. That ain't it, either.It takes maybe a little to see that the movie isn't even close to being over so you look to the length of the film. It's 3 hours long! The fact that it starts showing the year in which things happen gives the final clue it is an epic story. The complexity of the characters hint at a book or something like that and, indeed, the story is written by poet Jimmy Santiago Baca, based on his personal experience. It's almost a biopic.And look at the cast! Damian Chapa is pretty known, but also Benjamin Bratt, Delroy Lindo, Victor Rivers (can't have a movie about Mexicans without Rivers - I really think he should have gotten more main roles), Billy Bob Thornton, Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo and even Jimmy Santiago Baca himself as Gato, who I don't really remember.About the movie itself, its main strength is the characters. Each of the lead characters is being carefully sketched and then transformed by the story. The ending, most of all, explains the feelings and reality of the people involved. There were criticisms that the movie was overacted sometimes. Perhaps, but most of it was actually in character. Miklo is someone who is desperately, so desperately, trying to belong. Of course he overacts. His whole character is made up in his head.So, as a conclusion to this too long review this is not a masterpiece, but it is a movie about the truth of people in those times, and it is well done. Truthful films are more and more scarce as the time goes by. If you find the time and mood to watch this white Mexican biopic, I don't think you will be disappointed.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"13 September 2013","score":"","review":" The only thing scary about Friday the 13th is if Rebecca Black star in the film and start singing. Friday the 13th has always been considered an unlucky day at least since the 14th. Many people that Friday was the day that Jesus Christ was crucified adding to its unpopularity. It's a superstition that continue to haunt people even today. It made sense, in a marketing standpoint, that horror movie was going to be created for this. Sadly, the film doesn't deal with the paranormal, occultism, or anything to do with the fear of the date. Rather, the audience is treated with slasher film. Don't get me wrong, the Friday the 13th film series is one of the greatest horror series in the world, but just think of how awesome it would had been if they kept the original superstition in the film. I know the TV series dealt with the bad luck and curses, but the film should had too. Unlike the other Friday the 13th sequels and reboots, Friday the 13th, the original film lacks a big man character. Don't bother watching it, if you looking for the fictional character Jason Voorhees. He barely show up in the film. Plus, he didn't even don his hockey mask yet. So that is a letdown. The film mainly focuses on Jason Voorhees, who drowned as a boy at Camp Crystal Lake due to the negligence of the camp staff. Decades later, the lake is rumored to be cursed and is the setting for a series of mass murders. It doesn't stop, the camp's new owner and seven young counselors are readying the property for re-opening despite warnings by local residents. The curse proves true on Friday the 13th as one by one each of the counselors is stalked by a fierce killer. The movie directed by Sean Cunningham is probably well known for the twist about who the murderer really is. I have to say it's pretty predictable who did it, even if you haven't watch the other films. The movie fails to explain why the killer was killing people off, now. Are they still related to the drowning of Jason? Is the person just angry that the camp is opening up again? Plus, how on the Earth did the way older killer with that small body size kill younger people three times her size? It's seem unrealistic. I love the POV, seeing through the eyes of a killer. People say it's from 1978's Halloween, but I have to disagree with them. I think this point of view film making was create by Michael Powell for his film 1960's Peeping Tom. The ending fight is just laughable, and takes too long. The ending with the last survivor in the canoe on the lake was pretty good, but sadly it was just a dream. The whole reason for the 'dream' cliffhanger at the end to make the sequel with Jason. The cast stereotypes are pretty tamed compare to the sequels. They were a bit likable, unlike the sequels where the victims are made out to be spoil brats. Nice to see a pre-famous, Kevin Bacon in this film. The acting was mediocre at best. There are two version of this film out there. The Uncut version and R Rated version. There isn't much different between the two, trust me. I think the uncut version is probably worst than the R Rated one as it seem like they cut more from the film. It has low production values, and the gore wasn't too badly made. It look pretty real to me. I fail to see a moral's message in the film, if only the screenwriters were to make the story have more depth, then it can work better. Between the violent and the sex scenes, it just seem wasted time that could had focus more on what the story is supposed to bring out. It seem pointless and boring. There is a lot of nostalgia feel to the film, as it did help establish the now overused clichés of slasher films like the last survivor being a woman and having pointless nudity and gore. Somewhat, I kinda miss the Alfred Hitchcock's type of slasher films. The film seem to take 1960's Psycho shrieking violins and try to make it seem like its own. It doesn't work. . The hiss soundtrack was amazing, but can be annoying. It goes on way too long. It does work for the film, but it made me wonder if a snake guy was chasing them. Overall it's one of the films, you have to watch at less once, if you into the 1980's horror genre. Just don't think too much about it when watching. It's just one of those films you watch if you want cheap thrills.

Escape From New York is anything but cerebral or sophisticated. Instead, it's a rather absurd little sci-fi film that actually manages to be awfully entertaining despite being utterly ridiculous. Much of this is because the film takes itself so very seriously--and this heightens the campy atmosphere and makes the film a lot of fun.This John Carpenter film is set in the near future. Lawlessness has taken hold until society has come up with a strange solution--to turn Manhattan Island into a giant prison. This 'prison' is really just a dumping ground--a dumping ground where there are no guards and no rules--just a weird self-created society of scum.When a terrorist hijacks Air Force One and crashes it into this city, the President is able to use an escape pod--but he lands in the middle of this hellish city. For some odd reason, instead of sending in the Marines or the Navy Seals, they send in one man--'Snake' Plissken (Kurt Russell). Plissken is ridiculously overplayed by Russell--and that adds to the fun. I am pretty sure he didn't take himself very seriously and the viewer certainly can't! Plissken is sort of like Rambo and Clint Eastwood (Russell REALLY had the Eastwood voice down pat)--but even more indestructible! Now Plissken is NOT the hero type. He himself is a convicted criminal but he's also a war hero. To convince him to take the assignment, they not only promise him his freedom but his life. You see, this is because they implanted a nanoprobe into him that will kill him if the assignment isn't completed in 24 hours! Can he do it? What do you think? As I said above, Plissken is played in such an overly serious and over-the-top manner that the film is really a hoot to watch. Also, the film is very original even if it is silly. A few other things I loved were the faux computer graphics (done amazingly well considering everything--see the IMDb trivia for more on this), the scene towards the end of the President having his revenge on 'The Duke' and the incredible soundtrack (by Carpenter himself). All in all, a dumb but incredibly cool guilty pleasure. And sometimes you just have to let your brain relax and watch something mindlessly fun.

Now however, 55 years later, it lacks the lovable endeavour it was once looked upon by. Sure, Alfred Hitchcock does what he does best in this film (and I am in no way disputing his directing talents) and full appreciation must go towards him for the visual effects and the way he uses filming techniques to show Scottie's confusement. Credit must also go to James Stewart as Scottie who seemed to be the only thing worth watching about this film. That, however is I'm afraid all the positives that can be said about this film. The first part of the movie drags with little happening and the rest of the film fails to pick up from there. Sure in 1958 this movie was full of suspense and thought provoking cinema however in this era it just seems dull and lacks the suspense needed to make it enjoyable. The fact this film is called a 'suspense thriller' is almost laughable. The film seems to meander around shots of walking and driving and stalking for a good 40 minutes, something which when the film didn't start that great in the first place doesn't help its cause. The storyline was fairly obvious as well, even for a simpleton like me to guess, in addition to the dull as ditch water dialogue (even at the time) that's teemed with it. The directing as I've mentioned is not to blame and the use of colours and sound are brilliant by Hitchcock but that cannot make up for Vertigo which promised so much and produced so very little on the big screen. I would recommend this film to Hitchcock fans but it is by no means his best film, not even close. The lack of suspense and boring storyline despite the cleverness of Hitchcock means this film has to have 5 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"13 September 2013","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Vertigo was a film that was ahead of its time when it was released.

Now however, 55 years later, it lacks the lovable endeavour it was once looked upon by. Sure, Alfred Hitchcock does what he does best in this film (and I am in no way disputing his directing talents) and full appreciation must go towards him for the visual effects and the way he uses filming techniques to show Scottie's confusement. Credit must also go to James Stewart as Scottie who seemed to be the only thing worth watching about this film. That, however is I'm afraid all the positives that can be said about this film. The first part of the movie drags with little happening and the rest of the film fails to pick up from there.

It was supposedly drunk driving, but Stallone doesn't buy it. He sets out on a quest to find out what really happened and put it right. While doing so, he grows close to his niece, Rachel Leigh Cook, who does a very nice job.

Hoping to convince townsfolk to join his cause to persuade Miller to avoid a mistaken gunfight, Kane tries and fails. So as the clock ticks to noon, Kane comes to a realization that the odds are not in his favor. With a Quaker wife (Grace Kelly) he had just married attempting to motivate him to leave town with life intact, Kane's integrity and pride won't allow him to. Kane's hotshot young deputy, Harv (Lloyd Bridges) wants Kane to leave so he can be given the spot as top dawg, but Will thinks he's too immature and not ready. After boozing up in the saloon, losing his claim to Will's former girl, Helen (Katy Jurado) who is planning to leave on the train, and hearing about Kane's courage even as no one seems willing to help him, Harv is set to do whatever he can to get the marshal to head out of Hadleyville&#x85;he's so insistent that Will leaves on a horse Harv would even saddle, a fight ensues! Guess who comes out the victor of those fisticuffs? Marshal Kane goes to the saloon and soon to church, looking around for anyone who will become special deputies, but the town debates and questions his facing Miller and the obvious results of violence that will occur, defaming and ruining a well-built positive reputation. Miller's men wait at the depot for their leader to step off that noon train, and Kane's time (as the pendulum of the clock continues to rock back and forth) draws shorter and shorter. The film has that fantastic the seconds tick and the faces of the town are shown in deep concern with that train's whistle sounding off like a death siren. The streets are empty, the anticipation is on the faces of Miller's men's faces (including a young Lee Van Cleef!), and the agonizing look of concern on Kane's face tells the whole story&#x85;he plans to die in Hadleyville, with no support by the very ones he was sworn to protect by the tin star pinned to his vest. There's an aching moment where Will watches as his wife and former flame ride to the train, and that feeling of abandonment rests on his face quite vividly. Kane does his duty, upholding it by using his intellect and the town's many hiding places (the stables, back yards, fences, etc.) to get some sort of advantage despite being outnumbered.There have been certain criticisms towards it that interested me. Kane's throwing the tin star to the ground after the men have been taken care of with all the townspeople flooding the street (Where were they when he needed them? Can you really blame him for feeling so betrayed?). Kelly's Amy coming to her husband's aid by shooting one of the gunfighters (He had no one else! And they had multiple guns firing at him.) And the emphasis on finding help and seeking support from a town he was a great deal responsible in civilizing and making healthy enough for families and progress instead of action and gunplay (The killer wasn't in town yet, and his boys were waiting for him to arrive before confronting Kane; and it's reasonable that Kane would try to find able-bodied men to back him up. Also, this is a town full of men; the sheer number should be enough to spook Miller a little bit.). So while there's this idea that subliminal messages on the Communist witchhunt was included within the context of Kane's struggle, I looked at the film as one man's mission to do the right thing and face what comes with that decision because he feels morally obligated to take this stand even if the town wishes he'd just leave. A woman's forgoing her religious belief of not killing (because her father and brother both died thanks to the gun) in order to save her man and it really stems from his no-win situation&#x85;if she doesn't help him then he'll surely perish. Kane dumping the tin star makes sense to me because he received nothing from those he protected, and their cowardice despite all he had accomplished for them (he arrested Miller and allowed the justice system to run its course; it's not his fault the man was freed) left him obviously wounded. No gunfight except that final ten minutes added to the build up to it&#x85;the wait until noon developed the dread of it, with the town caught up in the fear of Will asking them to back him up. So it's a classic worthy of its status as far as this western fan is concerned. The judge (Otto Krueger) leaving town (packing up all his law items and heading out), the old mentor (played by Lon Chaney, Jr. revealing a tired, weary old man no longer able to stand and fight as he once did) unable for health reasons to give assistance, and a colleague secretly hiding (Harry Morgan of M*A*S*H & Dragnet) and forcing his wife to lie on his whereabouts; these individual scenes infuse that Kane keeps looking (even a volunteer soon backs out when he learns that Will has no other backup) and failing in his task because of numerous excuses. That's the point Will tries hard, leaving no stone unturned, and is left to fend for himself.

Gangster No. 1 is certainly not troubling the calibre of those films.In 1999 a leading nameless gangster (Malcolm McDowell) finds out the man he over thrown, Freddie Mays (David Thewlis) is about to be released from prison after servicing a 30 year sentence. The Gangster reflects on his rise back in 1968 as a young man (Paul Bettany) in a world of violence, double crossing and betrayal.Gangster No. 1 is slog of a film; it tells a gangster's rise which is not breaking any new ground and it is one of the general generic gangster films that plague the British film industry. Gangster No. 1 attempts at being a little artistic but it comes off as obnoxious, particularly with McDowell's voice-over. The story is basically a misogynistic psychopath becomes power mad and sees human life as expendable. The Gangster is a man who enjoys violence and pain and yet we are meant to believe he was a character who wanted love, a character who felt guilty over a murder.Bettany is an excellent actor and it was clear he must have watched A Clockwork Orange because he was channelling McDowell's Alex character. He has a certain menace and charisma when he spoke and he nailed the physical performance of McDowell. But McDowell was phoning in his performance and his voice-over throughout the film was grating. David Thewlis and Saffron Burrows were fine in the supporting roles and most of the cast were solid, but Jamie Foreman is horrible actor. Foreman is the son of a real life gangster but he is one of the least threatening hardmen put to screen and he did these weird ticks to the character which was distracting.Paul McGuigan directed Gangster No. 1 and his body of work is a mixed bag.

It is a catastrophe of epic proportions. The romance in this film between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman crumbles because of bland dialogue and implausible plot devises.

The music used really adds to shock value of the ending.The characters in this film are what let's this film down the most. Most of the acting is wooden and not believable whatsoever. James Stewart is hopeless as the lead character and really drags the film down with a performance that could send anyone to sleep. Other supporting actors are 'ok' but none will leave you amazed and none are memorable bar the one saving grace in the cast Kim Novak; She is fantastic in her dual roles as Madeline and Judy and her performance will grip you and added to the feelings of shock and sadness I felt at the ending.Hitchcock is superb as Director as always. The way the film is made; from every camera angle to every sound you hear creates suspense and anticipation. The build-up to the climax is done very well and the climax itself executed to a good standard.Though well-made it is not 'perfect' and the first part of the film probably over did it when trying to create suspense and was in all honestly, a bit boring. If the pacing to the first half was altered slightly and Stewart had put a little more effort in this could have been near perfect.

Not a good roller coaster, the type of roller coaster that takes half an hour to get up to the top and then when it finally gets to the first drop it starts to pick up speed before grinding to a sudden halt again.Vertigo was written by Alfred Hitchcock and released in theatres in 1958. The film is regarded as a classic and commonly seen as some of Hitchcock's best work, and honestly, after watching I can understand how people where able to come to this conclusion. The majority of the main cast is excellent, but the standout actor for me was certainly James Stewart plays our main character, John Ferguson, who deserves a large amount of praise for how convincingly he played his role throughout the film, as he changes from a sympathetic protagonist into a rather obsessive crazy psychopath driven by his grief throughout the film.The film overall has a very strong plot with numerous unpredictable twists throughout that I would not even dare spoil. However in many ways the movie's age shows. Nowhere is this clearer than in the dated special effects in the film and the incredibly cheesy soundtrack that many of the older Hitchcock films are known for. Personally I do not have a problem either of these, as I find these aspects add to the classic feeling of the film; however, I can see it putting off some potential viewers.The only problem I had with the film was, as I mentioned above, is the films pacing. The film starts incredibly slow and is rather boring for the first thirty minutes before it begins picking up pace, however it then grinds to a second halt later on after the courtroom scene for another half hour before it finally picks up again for the climax of the film. While I can certainly forgive this in some ways, since the film is very entertaining when it is going at a decent pace, I still felt that it was quite jarring at several points during the movie.Overall I did enjoy Vertigo lot despite some issues I had with the pacing, but even with that issue I still feel that the film is a very entertaining watch, due to its unpredictable plot and the strong performances delivered by the lead actors. It is due to this that I am willing to rate Vertigo as an 8\/10.
