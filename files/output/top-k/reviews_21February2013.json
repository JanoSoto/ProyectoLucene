LOVE STORY is a film that I just watched for the first time and it's one that I knew about the ending long before. I guess everyone who knows anything about movies knows about the ending here but I'll get to more on that in a bit. I really, really, really understand why so many people love this movie and I understand why it was such a huge hit back in the day. Sometimes I watch movies and don't see what others see in it but there's no doubt that I fully understand the love some have for this film. With that said, it didn't completely work for me. There's no question that it will keep you entertained from start to finish but there were still a few major flaws that kept me from falling for it more. The biggest issue I had with the picture is that the screenplay was way too simple and cute for my liking. Not for a single second did I ever really feel like I was watching a real relationship and a real couple. Even their meeting scene and the eventual falling in love just seemed way too cute for their own good. It really did seem at times like the screenplay was just overbearing in its attempt to show how much these two loved one another. The dialogue was really forced at times and I think less would have been so much more. I also didn't think O'Neal was the greatest actor here. He perfectly fit the role and it's not hard to watch him here but at the same time I don't think the performance is great. MacGraw was good in her part as she certainly made you believe she was this character. Ray Milland was also extremely good because he didn't have to go over-the-top to play the mean father. I also enjoyed John Marley in the role of the girl's father. The film does benefit from some nice cinematography as well as a good score that perfectly fits the film. As for the ending, even though you're told about it at the very start of the film, it still manages to be quite good and perfectly handled by the director. LOVE STORY is a decent little movie but I think it could have been much better with a few changes in its story.

One of the most powerful lines in movie history was born and it's just heartbreaking to watch. The onlookers, so stifled by the conformity of their Victorian age, gather around in their top hats and well trimmed mustaches for a rare glimpse of abnormality that evaded the circus, the hospital and the madhouse. The prudish judges of normality are still everywhere even today, judging by and how some people still look down on deformities. John Merrick was human, and not only that a truly great intelligent man. The movie starts out with London surgeon Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) discovers John Merrick (John Hurt) in at freak show where he is managed by a brutal man by the name of Bytes. Frederick Treves tries to help the man, with not only his condition, but also to escape from the exploitations of Bytes. On the way, Merrick is both love and look upon by the public. Merrick is so deformed to the point that he must wear a hood and cap when in public due to Merrick's most life-threatening deformity, his abnormally large skull, which compels him to sleep with his head resting upon his knees, as the weight of his skull would asphyxiate him if he were to ever lie down. John Merrick tries everything to try to be normal. He talks in a sophisticated and articulate matter, he appears at operas, does art, reads, makes model and every looking for true happiness. Directed by one of the greatest directors, David Lynch, the movie works in every level. The black and white gives the film, its serious tone, while also giving the film, it's creepiest. The dream like scenes are chilling reminds me of his work on 'Eraserhead'. As clichéd as it might sound, about an hour into the movie, I didn't even really notice Joseph's deformities. At first, I was somewhat intimidated, but after a while, I focused more on who he was as a person and David Lynch makes you see him more like a human being by giving him depth. It would have been an astonishing act if the writers decided to show the true reaction of complete submission and self degradation of the Elephant-Man. I think David Lynch could have easily directed this alternative twist as well. The music of the film is ground-breaking. Adagio for Strings by Samuel Barber or Andre Previn gives the movie, its tragedy ending, while the theme song composed by John Morris gives the film, it's haunting score. The Victorian sets are has never looked so convincing on screen, yet with that nightmarish quality that defines most of the movie. Anthony Hopkin are well-acted, but I have to give it to John Hurt, You could only see his eyes behind the layers of makeup, but those expressive eyes does a masterful job in creating a sympathetic character out of a man who is at first glance a monster. I think Elephant Man not getting an award lead to the creation of the annual award for best makeup. Prior, makeup awards were given rarely, I believe. Just on special occasions. But when Elephant Man didn't get any nods for it, people rightfully complained and the academy then created the annual makeup award the next year. Still, the movie has it faults, first off John Merrick is really Joseph Merrick in real life. Dr. Treves' reminiscences mistakenly names Joseph Merrick as John Merrick, an error widely recirculated by biographers of Merrick. The film was based on Treves memoirs, and in them he crosses out ''Joseph'' and writes in ''John'' above - hence the confusion. No one knows the reason for the ''deliberate mistake'', because everyone knew Joseph was called Joseph, plus its written on his birth certificate,and he signed his only surviving letter ''Joseph Merrick'. There are many things that did not actually happen in the movie. Such as the beatings from Tom Norman AKA Bytes who treated Joseph Merrick with great care and respect in reality. Why would they beat him if they are making a lot of money off of him? We are also to believe that Joseph's mother never did love him in the film, in true, he was rejected by his father and stepmother, not his mother. John suffered from a rare, degenerative and progressive disease (Proteus Syndrome, I believe), and Merrick told Norman that he no longer wanted to be examined at the hospital. According to Norman, he said he was stripped naked, and felt like an animal in a cattle market' by Treves. So there is a lot of information that is left out. Period films are hard to pull off convincingly and here we are plunged into this utterly alien world but the story is never depressing nor preachy. Still poignant , deep,﻿perfect illustration of human flaws and human kindness. Such a gentle soul filled with deep inner beauty and not a mean bone in his body despite all of the painful horrors inflicted on him by a so called civilized society. There is a lesson to be learned about the dignity this one of a kind man maintained in a world that judged him on the texture of his outward appearance such so that he went through life with his head held up high even when he was sleeping. Bless you Joseph Merrick your inner beauty trumped all.

The plot of the film is brief, but it works. It's about a well organized heist that goes terribly wrong. Truth is, there is a rat in the whole operation, but who? With that in place, Tarantino takes us beyond what is said on paper and retraces the steps it took these men to get to the predicament they are in now. We see the back stories of Mr. White, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange, all without ever meaning to place them in the middle of the conflict. Its a movie that only the viewer can interpret, and the important facts are placed at the forefront to help come to a conclusion. This information works in favor of the main narrative. Some have complained about not hearing the origins of Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue, Nice Guy Eddie and Joe Cabot. I agree. Perhaps more clarification of their purposes might have enhanced the narrative. Perhaps it would have answered the obvious question, What was the point of this whole operation? I'm sure Quentin would have made the film twice as long and incorporated all of their stories had he made the film today. Needless to say, It does not take away from the experience.

We might wonder why they weren't paired again? Although Gene was a well established MGM star, this was Don's first musical outside his home studio of Universal. He would do another MGM musical the next year I Love Melvin. Debbie Reynolds again was the romantic lead. Clearly, this film was not given the royal treatment of the present film and is much shorter. But, it gives us an opportunity to see what Don and Debbie could do without Gene and Cyd(quite a lot of fun,too!) Reportedly, working with Gene on the present film was rather a traumatic experience for both Don and Debbie, especially the latter. Gene's extreme perfectionism and egoism was legendary. Nonetheless, nearly all his costars, especially Debbie, improved their dancing and acting by working with him. However, neither Don nor Debbie was anxious to do another film with Gene, and neither did.Debbie was actually an anomaly in Gene's '50s musical comedies. In every other of his last 5 Hollywood musicals beginning in '51, his first choice as his leading lady and main female dance partner was Cyd Charisse. Cyd had been kicking around Hollywood for a decade, mostly as a cameo dance specialist. Gene wanted her to costar in An American in Paris the previous year, but a pregnancy ruled that out. Of course, she was a conspicuous dance specialist in the present film. She was his leading lady in the much less commercially successful Brigadoon and It's Always Fair Weather, but declined this role in Gene's last Hollywood musical Les Girls, as did An American in Paris costar Leslie Caron. I think they rightly smelled a turkey.I'd like to talk about Don's famous Make 'Em Laugh solo performance, having seen nearly all his Hollywood musicals. Although there are certainly original features to this madcap performance, you might be interested to know that a number of the main features can be recognized in several of his previous Universal films, from '45-'51. Thus, in Top Man, Don and Peggy Ryan dance with cloth dummies in one scene. In Something in the Wind, he does the bit behind the couch, although without the dummy.In Feudin', Fightin'and Fussin', he does the terminal plunge through a papery wall after dancing. In Double Crossbones, we see his jumping up on a wall, followed by a backwards flip. Even the tune was essentially recycled from the Be a Clown Gene Kelly-Judy Garland performance in The PirateHaving also seen nearly all of Gene's Hollywood musical comedies, I'd like to comment on the relation of some of his past and future performances to this film. Back in '44, he costarred in a color film with Rita Hayworth and Phil Silvers, called Cover Girl. Several features of that film have often lead to it being dubbed 'the poor man's Singing in the Rain' . Phil takes the place of Don, as the odd man out in the central romance, but nonetheless an intimate friend of the romantic couple. Rita takes the place of Debbie, being a stage dancer and singer. This threesome do a street dance of joy, sometimes arm in arm, twice, including the parting scene. This somewhat resembles the Good Morning and threesome Singing in the Rain scenes in the present film. Also, Gene does a solo street dance with his shadow, somewhat foreshadowing his Singing in the Rain solo street dance in this film. However, there is a critical mood difference. That 'Alter-Ego' dance was inspired by frustration and apprehension about his future relationship with Rita's character, not by the elation of a new found love, as in the present film.As regards his future films, we see Gene's joyful Singing in the Rain solo as a model for functionally equivalent solos in his next two musicals It's Always Fair Weather and Brigadoon, in the form of the I Like Myself and Almost Like Being in Love dances. I find the former performance, done on roller skates, his most challenging and interesting dance. Don, who didn't do solo dances in this context in his prior Universal musicals, did a functionally similar new love-inspired performance in the first portion of his long I Wanna Wander performance in MGM's I Love Melvin, and his classy A Man Chases a Girl dance performance in Fox's There's No Business Like Show Business. His equivalent solo dance in Fox's Call Me Madam was, like Gene's previous dances in Cover Girl and On the Town, born out of romantic frustration, but seemed like a dance of enthusiasm, because he got drunk from his frustration! Even MGM's Fred Astaire got in on this trend with his classic new love -inspired ceiling and wall You're All the World to Me dance in Royal Wedding, the previous year, and his solo Seeing is Believing levitation dance on a high building in The Belle of New York, released the same year as Singing in the Rain, and unfortunately overshadowed by it.

This film is a Cult Classic and one of Carpenter's best.Based on John Steakley's novel of the same name,Vampires tells the story of Jack Crow(James Woods)a vampire killer\/slayer who leads a group of other vampire killer\/slayers who are all good at their jobs. But when a vicious vampire names Valek(Thomas Ian Griffith)kills his whole squad,Jack wants revenge and to kill Valek. Now with the help of his partner Montoya(Daniel Baldwin),Hooker Katrina(Sheryl Lee)and Catholic Priest Father Guiteau(Tim Guinee)Jack must figure out how stop Valek before it's too late.I think that one of the reasons John Carpenter's Vampires is one of the best Vampire films ever made is because of the way John Carpenter approaches the material and the vampires in the film. The vampires in this film aren't surrounded by a Gothic background and the vampires are not romantic,they're ugly,violent vicious creatures who would bite you and kill you in a split second and drain you of your blood. This is the way I love seeing Vampires portrayed on screen as violent killers and not romantics or sentimental like in the Twilight films,but as real vampires. What I also love about the film is the Western style Carpenter injects into the film. Carpenter loves Western films and most of his films are pretty much Westerns in disguise and it's fully evident here. Carpenter takes the influence of great Western directors such as John Ford,Howard Hawks(Carpenter's favorite director),Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah brings it into the Southwest Texas locations in Vampires,using brown dirt and dust and old fashion Western style towns that either have people or the towns in the film are deserted. If you look at Carpenter's other films like Escape From New York,Escape From L.A,Big Trouble In Little China,Assault On Precinct 13,They Live and Ghosts Of Mars all of those films are in the Western style whether it's in the modern world like Big Trouble or They Live or in the future like the Escape films and Ghosts Of Mars the Western influence is still there in the films. Jack Crow is a classic Carpenter antihero and one of the best Vampire killers in film history. Like a lot of Carpenter antihero's Jack Crow is tough,aggressive and very much an individual who can take on anything and anyone and also spits out cynical dialog with a dark sense of Humor and grit. As the film goes on you start to understand why Jack became a Vampire killer and why he has such hatred and disdain for vampires and what they're about and it will bring depth to the character. What also brings depth to the Jack Crow character is his relationships and friendships with his partner Montoya and Father Guteau because with Montoya the relationship while harsh and filled with tough guy dialog seems genuine and real and you feel Jack and Montoya truly care for each other where as Jack Crow's relationship with Father Guteau(or Padre as Jack calls him)takes much longer to develop,but as the film goes on Jack begins to respect Guteau. The violence and gore in the film are well-done and suit the film and matching the overall harshness and grit of the film. The Action scenes in the film are also well-executed and are done in the great Western style that the film has. The blood and gore in the film is amazing and realistic and the blood flow does not stop until the end. If there something in the film that will bother most viewers it's the middle section and ending of the film. I happen to like the middle section despite the lack of Action and gore because the middle gives viewers a chance to know and care about the characters and the plot. The ending is great and memorable because and while some will be angry that there is not a lot of Action,a huge body count or bloodbath,it's a thrilling conclusion to Vampires and is a wonderful Western ending.The cast does a great job in their roles. James Woods gives one of his best performances as Jack Crow,a master Vampire slayer,with Woods bringing toughness,grit,one-liners and depth to the role. Great performance. Daniel Baldwin is wonderful as Montoya,Jack's partner. Baldwin has good scenes and good chemistry with Woods. Sheryl Lee does a great job and is sexy as Katrina,a hooker who was bit by Valek and helps Jack and Montoya. Lee also has good scenes with Baldwin. Thomas Ian Griffith is frightening and menacing as Valek,in my opinion one of the best vampire villains in film history. Maximilian Schell does a good job as Cardinal Alba. Tim Guinee also does a good job as Father Guiteau,the priest who helps Jack and Montoya.The direction by John Carpenter is excellent with Carpenter bringing a great Western atmosphere to the film and also makes the film visually stunning to look at. Great direction by Carpenter.The score by John Carpenter is wonderful and has a great,gritty Western sound to it and matches the mood and tone to the film. Another great Carpenter score.The special effects and make-up by K.N.B is impressive,bloody,gory and very realistic.

He must try and take care of his eccentric family including his retarded brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), his obese mother (Darlene Cates) as well as try and keeps his affair with a married woman (Mary Streenburgen) quiet. After meeting a stranger (Juliette Lewis) he begins to think that he might be better served just leaving the town and his family behind. I watched this movie when it was first released and thought it was extremely good but I think it's safe to say that time has been very good to the film as its not only shaped into a classic but I think it's improved all around. I think the movie is just about as perfect as you can get in showing someone who is just at the end of everything including being fed up with their life and the burden of the expectations that are on them. This here is where the film is so special because the Gilbert character really does feel like a real person who just wants to escape but can't find a way to do it. The film was incredibly realistic and I think it manages to be rather heartbreaking along the way even though there are certainly bits of romance and comedy scattered throughout. The greatest thing going are without question the performances. DiCaprio turns in one of the greatest performances that you're ever going to see as the mentally challenged Arnie. Just the way he performs the character is something really special to watch as he's got some perfect small touches and not for a second do you ever believe you're just watching an actor do a part. The supporting cast is terrific with Lewis, Steenburgen, Cates, John C. Reilly, Crispin Glover and Kevin Tighe perfectly fitting their roles. Depp, and everyone for that matter, were overlooked due to how great DiCaprio was but I think he too gives one of the better performances of his career. Everyone's gotten so used to his over-the-top and flashy characters that it's pretty amazing to see him play the opposite. The film has so many touching and memorable scenes and the director really pulls them all together wonderfully. Classics get better over time and I think this is a perfect example of that.

After meeting a stranger (Juliette Lewis) he begins to think that he might be better served just leaving the town and his family behind. I watched this movie when it was first released and thought it was extremely good but I think it's safe to say that time has been very good to the film as its not only shaped into a classic but I think it's improved all around. I think the movie is just about as perfect as you can get in showing someone who is just at the end of everything including being fed up with their life and the burden of the expectations that are on them. This here is where the film is so special because the Gilbert character really does feel like a real person who just wants to escape but can't find a way to do it. The film was incredibly realistic and I think it manages to be rather heartbreaking along the way even though there are certainly bits of romance and comedy scattered throughout. The greatest thing going are without question the performances. DiCaprio turns in one of the greatest performances that you're ever going to see as the mentally challenged Arnie. Just the way he performs the character is something really special to watch as he's got some perfect small touches and not for a second do you ever believe you're just watching an actor do a part. The supporting cast is terrific with Lewis, Steenburgen, Cates, John C. Reilly, Crispin Glover and Kevin Tighe perfectly fitting their roles. Depp, and everyone for that matter, were overlooked due to how great DiCaprio was but I think he too gives one of the better performances of his career. Everyone's gotten so used to his over-the-top and flashy characters that it's pretty amazing to see him play the opposite. The film has so many touching and memorable scenes and the director really pulls them all together wonderfully. Classics get better over time and I think this is a perfect example of that.

And since profit is better than sex, that's something that Wall Street's (1987) Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) and his lap dog Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) just can't abide. So perfect information is their roadkill. Oliver Stone's Wall Street is one that, far from promoting efficient markets, hoards, corrupts or shreds every shred of data it can get its hands on&#x97;even birthday cards. Fox's struggles with information would prefigure Sheen's own struggle to define his public persona as his predilection for prostitutes and blow seeped out, a battle in which Sheen ultimately threw in the towel by consenting to a Comedy Central roast.Information is coin of Stone's realm. When Fox asks a sales colleague to predict the market, he answers If I knew, I wouldn't be in this business. Indeed, he'd be in Gekko's. Fox quests to make that very leap &#x97;hence the signage for a company called Info Quest than Stone unsubtly gives us a glimpse of. All secrets are in play. Even Gekko's birthdate is an unearthed informational stepping stone towards those portending double doors. And everyone is breathing from the respirator of the ticker tape.Even Gekko. But sans inside information, Gekko's patience for Fox lasts only minutes (of story time&#x97;or seconds of screen time). If you're not inside, you're outside, Gekko admonishes. Few are more despicable to him than the snake oil salesmen of technical trading&#x97;men who pretend to possess information when they have only hunches. Gekko's appetite for *real* information is insatiable his office boasts state-of-the-art monitors, a coterie of well-connected traders, and most importantly, a multi-story window on the world. Outside of the office, Gekko has a magic wand that iconic cell phone connecting him back to his nerve centers. Lest we miss the point, Stone and co-writer Stanley Weiser leave us with such gems as Information is everything&#x97;not everything can be as quotable as Greed is good.Stone isn't shy with his symbolism, either. As soon as Gekko conscripts Fox as his spy, the latter dons a pair of aviators, whether indoors or out. The shots of their opaque reflective coating recall&#x97;as do many films' shots of such sunglasses&#x97;the assaultive but introjective gaze of the policeman who pulls over Marion in Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). Similarly emboldened, Fox now slinks his way from private restaurants to private airports in pursuit of information to feed to his master. Along the way, those shady shades are mirrored by the mirroring facades of the skyscrapers honored by aerial establishing shots peppered throughout the film murder *won't* out. The shots also echo a show-off shot squarely into the reflective window of Fox's swanky new UES pad while he dines over candlelight with his foxy interior designer lady friend, at the peak of his puissance. But like the apartment's fake exposed brick, there's no there there, and Fox is left to wonder out on his vertiginous deck, in a line that would come to be parodied and parroted by Zoolander's (2001) Zoolander, Who am I?Who he is, of course, is an insider trader. Info is Fox's ticket up, but it's also his ticket out. Or is it? Perhaps it's not too counter-textual to read his downfall as that of the man who knew *too little.* Too little about the SEC investigators on his heels, too little about how to make money honestly, too little about the laws of gravity.Most of all, too little about his own family. Stone and Fox are both at their most didactic when the latter blares as his father Carl (Martin Sheen, Charlie's father), who has just walked out on Gekko's pension- gutting proposal, What I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand his son being more successful than him! This is Stone's Marxist moralizing at its barest the impudent son, who only speculates in capital, wrongly denigrating the wisdom of the father, who works with his hands. If money never sleeps, then it is surely the strumpet in Carl's retort, I don't go to sleep with no whore, and I don't wake up with no whore!Oh, how life imitates art. Money, whores, and failing to follow in his father's noble footsteps would cut Charlie Sheen down to size yet again, two decades later. In 2011, the law of gravity&#x97;aided and abetted coke and booze&#x97;brought Sheen's stratospheric career and boyish jowls drooping back down to terra firma. When you can't argue with the data, your best bet is to argue with the interpretation. Sheen did so parsimoniously with a drumbeat of #winning, a meme that would transcend its Twitter origins as a watchword for self-defined success. The schadenfreude came to a head in Comedy Central's Roast of Charlie Sheen (2011), where host Seth MacFarlane introduced the guest of honor as having only been great in two things 25 years ago (likely referring to Wall Street and Platoon (1986)). MacFarlane continued Carlos Estévez took his dad's name to gain credibility as an actor. I've seen your films, and you don't really act like a Sheen.

The movie is extremely intelligent and every frame of the movie is meant to be in the movie for some reason. The Director, David Fincher is Fantastic.If we desperately needed a movie against consumerism this is it! Here is one of the quotes You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet.If we needed a positive movie or a positive message or to learn something positive, or something that at least makes us feel good or feel uplifted in some way, This is not it, and This is anything but it.Here is another one of the movies' unique quotes that gets shouted more than onceYou're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world. Here is another line that someone shouts You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.If you like dark negative movies, this is a good one. If you want to be uplifted, this is not your movie, it's Jack Movie as the DVD tells you.

Although I appeared in several on-stage, I don't much care for musicals. Most musicals I see as fanciful family entertainment that is harmless, depth less and child-friendly, loaded with the type of music that brings a tear to the eye of the nostalgic and encourages one and all to sing heartily along with those actor\/singers on the stage or screen. In my opinion, West Side Story is a miracle. It's referred to as a musical, but oh, it's so much more. Everyone who's a die-hard fan of West Side Story can agree with that. According to many critics, West Side Story has a significant flaw, and that is the casting of Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer in the two starring roles of Maria and Tony. Critics complain that both those actors were cast as the tragic lovers solely for their celebrity. Well, that's no surprise, it happens more often that not. I don't know what other actors were considered for the role of Maria in the film version besides Natalie Wood, and frankly, folks, I cannot envision any other actor who could bring Maria to life with more honesty and loveliness than Natalie Wood. Granted, Natalie did not sing as Maria, a major flaw critics loved to point out and scoff at. But then, Audrey Hepburn did not do her own singing in My Fair Lady, either. Audrey, like Natalie, is an outstanding actor with a genius for dialects. Another example is Dorothy Dandridge, the incomparable goddess of stage and screen who ALSO did not do her own singing in her Oscar-nominated performance as Carmen Jones; although she was a jazz\/blues singer of the highest repute, her voice was not tailored to sing opera. With actors like these who had it all and then some, no one's gonna notice, or care, that someone else is singing for them! I only know of two actors considered for the role of Tony Warren Beatty and Elvis Presley. I really can't see Warren Beatty who was King of On screen Gigolos at that time in the role of Tony, an ex-gang-banger from the streets of NYC and decidedly NOT a gigolo. Elvis Presley, on the other hand, would have been a PERFECT Tony, at least in my opinion. His performances in King Creole and Jailhouse Rock proved Elvis to be a fine actor, and he would have had no trouble playing street-wise ex-gang-member Tony. And, needless to say, Elvis would have had no trouble singing Tony's sweeping ballads. Unfortunately, Elvis could never have been cast as Tony because his overwhelming celebrity and drawing power would have diverted all attention from everyone and everything that made West Side Story what it was. On the other hand, I will never understand what possessed central casting or whomever was responsible to cast Richard Beymer as Tony. This sounds mean, I know, but I will not sugar-coat my outrage. Not only did Beymer not do his own singing, but he was as appropriate in the role of Tony as TV-ghoul-of-the-night Elvira would be playing Cinderella. Nonetheless, West Side Story as a whole is brilliant to the point where it's possible to excuse Beymer's miscasting. If you've never seen West Side Story, treat yourself to a priceless film experience! For die-hard fans like myself, West Side Story will continue to rein supreme above all!

Even so I know that it is a film-experience that very much feels unlike any other, with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike, visually beautiful because the images are impactful, and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like wall-to-wall music.So with 'Lost Highway' we have a wife killer who for legal purposes isn't named O.J. Simpson but Fred Madison. As he's awaiting execution in his prison cell he's plagued by guilt, crippling headaches and a lack of sleep so he receives a sleeping pill that doesn't appear to be too successful at helping him fall asleep but it certainly helps him to go places.Fred takes a trip to wish fulfillment land where he is Pete, an attractive young lad with half-biker, half-Beaver suburban parents (thanks Donald Lyons) who don't forbid him to go out with his druggy friends at night but actually encourage him to do so. He's popular at work and talented at what he does. He has an influential friend who sticks up for him (preferably with a gun up somebody's butt) and a girlfriend who he is able to fully sexually please. And the sun is shining on him and on his next door neighbor's idyllic garden that unmistakably belongs to the poor guy who keeled over at the beginning of 'Blue Velvet' although except for the little family dog nobody seems to be at home.Skip to This Magic Moment as Pete hooks up with Alice, his criminally influential friend's girlfriend who conveniently is the blonde spitting image of Renee, Fred's dead wife. After some fun times in cheap motel rooms Pete starts to question Alice's sincerity about really carrying about him, she comes off as calculating as she seemingly out of nowhere comes up with a murder plot that requires Pete's assistance with him getting to do the dirty job. It recalls the plot of 'Double Indemnity' while a lot of minor things ooze of 'Vertigo', from the dame's blonde doppelgänger to a floating head in a dream to policemen tailing an unfaithful guy as he gets more pussy than a toilet seat, but those small similarities add up.As the frame shakes and quakes from time to time and the image loses focus for a moment while the volume of the droning on the soundtrack fluctuates the dream gradually turns into a nightmare and the irony of it all is that Fred's fantasy-self eventually is the cause of his predicament for Pete ends up in the position of the guy who Fred's wife cheats on. After his elaborate trip of denial Fred probably understands this other guy better than ever but instead of this knowledge bringing about a catharsis it more and more makes his dream resemble the nightmare that his life has become.This loss of control is where the highway from the opaque movie title comes into play. The two credit sequences show the view from a car as it drives on a highway at night while David Bowie sings cruise me, blonde - cruise me, babe sounding like he's falling into an abyss as he lets everybody know I'm deranged. As much as this image is associated with Lynch's film this particular highway actually is only seen once as part of the story. It's when Pete and Alice drive out into the desert after she got him to kill Andy for some money. Now she tells Pete that they have to meet a friend of hers who lives in a 'Kiss Me Deadly' cabin in the desert. He wouldn't know what else to do and of course he loves her so he goes along with it. But Alice is taking him for the proverbial ride.Fred thought he couldn't keep his wife in his own bed because he was a lousy lay, which was devastating enough for him to go mental on her and to cover their shared bedroom floor with her body parts like he was making his own little home movie adaption of the Black Dahlia case. But when Alice says to the stud Pete while having sex You'll never have me he makes a banally simple realization, a truth so basic that he can only hope to escape it by leaving wish fulfillment land behind and entering the world of his memories, the past as he remembers it, not necessarily how it happened. That truth is that woman isn't only flesh and bone and smooth skin but also soul, and unless maybe her name is Beyoncé woman isn't a thing that can be owned, not even if you like it and you put a ring on it.As the fantasy-bubble bursts and Pete turns into Fred again without a change of location his mysterious friend already awaits him to put the Betacam on him once more provoking him to face facts by insisting to say to the camera what his fücking name is. But not all hope is lost quite yet, Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinister-voiced unknown who tells him that Dick Laurent is dead before the whole thing ever even started, a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen, that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter, that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir.

But when Alice says to the stud Pete while having sex You'll never have me he makes a banally simple realization, a truth so basic that he can only hope to escape it by leaving wish fulfillment land behind and entering the world of his memories, the past as he remembers it, not necessarily how it happened.

But not all hope is lost quite yet, Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinister-voiced unknown who tells him that Dick Laurent is dead before the whole thing ever even started, a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen, that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter, that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir. ","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"21 February 2013","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" As much as I keep thinking about the content of 'Lost Highway', every time I watch it I'm so captivated by its style and atmosphere that I never really analyze what makes it work technically, nor do I have much of a desire to dissect it. Even so I know that it is a film-experience that very much feels unlike any other, with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike, visually beautiful because the images are impactful, and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like wall-to-wall music.So with 'Lost Highway' we have a wife killer who for legal purposes isn't named O.J. Simpson but Fred Madison. As he's awaiting execution in his prison cell he's plagued by guilt, crippling headaches and a lack of sleep so he receives a sleeping pill that doesn't appear to be too successful at helping him fall asleep but it certainly helps him to go places.Fred takes a trip to wish fulfillment land where he is Pete, an attractive young lad with half-biker, half-Beaver suburban parents (thanks Donald Lyons) who don't forbid him to go out with his druggy friends at night but actually encourage him to do so. He's popular at work and talented at what he does. He has an influential friend who sticks up for him (preferably with a gun up somebody's butt) and a girlfriend who he is able to fully sexually please. And the sun is shining on him and on his next door neighbor's idyllic garden that unmistakably belongs to the poor guy who keeled over at the beginning of 'Blue Velvet' although except for the little family dog nobody seems to be at home.Skip to This Magic Moment as Pete hooks up with Alice, his criminally influential friend's girlfriend who conveniently is the blonde spitting image of Renee, Fred's dead wife. After some fun times in cheap motel rooms Pete starts to question Alice's sincerity about really carrying about him, she comes off as calculating as she seemingly out of nowhere comes up with a murder plot that requires Pete's assistance with him getting to do the dirty job. It recalls the plot of 'Double Indemnity' while a lot of minor things ooze of 'Vertigo', from the dame's blonde doppelgänger to a floating head in a dream to policemen tailing an unfaithful guy as he gets more pussy than a toilet seat, but those small similarities add up.As the frame shakes and quakes from time to time and the image loses focus for a moment while the volume of the droning on the soundtrack fluctuates the dream gradually turns into a nightmare and the irony of it all is that Fred's fantasy-self eventually is the cause of his predicament for Pete ends up in the position of the guy who Fred's wife cheats on. After his elaborate trip of denial Fred probably understands this other guy better than ever but instead of this knowledge bringing about a catharsis it more and more makes his dream resemble the nightmare that his life has become.This loss of control is where the highway from the opaque movie title comes into play. The two credit sequences show the view from a car as it drives on a highway at night while David Bowie sings cruise me, blonde - cruise me, babe sounding like he's falling into an abyss as he lets everybody know I'm deranged. As much as this image is associated with Lynch's film this particular highway actually is only seen once as part of the story. It's when Pete and Alice drive out into the desert after she got him to kill Andy for some money. Now she tells Pete that they have to meet a friend of hers who lives in a 'Kiss Me Deadly' cabin in the desert. He wouldn't know what else to do and of course he loves her so he goes along with it.

This was broadly interpreted as any old tat so long as it featured Baby Jesus and\/or Adult Jesus. Bonus points were added if gruesome crucifixions were also present. A good example of this was Ben Hur. It was convenient to ignore the fact that well-oiled scantily-clad men in homo-erotic situations were the mainstay of these films or that gyrating scantily-clad women of ill virtue filled the screen for long lingering minutes whilst we were supposed to reflect on what bad lots they were. A good crucifixion always cancelled out other ultra-violence such as body mangling in chariot racing or mauling by stuffed lions. How can we ever calculate the damage done to impressionable minds by these mad educational policies?Anyway, I propose that Three Kings be given the same treatment i.e. all American children between the ages of 5 and 11 should be compelled to go to a movie theatre and see this film. Why? Because hidden in this load of old tat is both an adventure film that they would enjoy and a couple of morally important messages (Viz. i) America doesn't give a toss about democracy and acts only out of self interest and ii) violence is actually pretty horrible and has bloody consequences which are graphically portrayed here). No one will ever notice that these messages get hopelessly tangled up in a nutty screenplay that definitely wants to have its cake and eat it too.George Clooney (for it is he) leads a team of Americans in an attempt to steal gold belonging to Saddam Hussein. This is all for personal profit. But the team gradually realise the consequences on the locals who are being oppressed by Saddam's soldiers and suffering even though the war is over and they expect the Americans to pick up the pieces. It all ends with the gold being shared out with the locals and the lot of them being escorted over the Iraqi border against express US wishes. Although it seems to me that the film conveys a clear anti-American sentiment I'm not convinced people will get that unless they want to get it. For one thing the oldish guy behind me in the theatre kept muttering loudly kill 'em, shoot 'em! whenever ANY non-American appeared on screen. Obviously it was too subtle for him.Anyway, Clooney is good (surprise!). In The Peacemaker I was convinced that Nicole Kidman should have been cast as the tough guy and Clooney as the one who hangs back and looks decorative. But he's been working on his designer stubble and gruff voice and this time I could believe he was a Special Forces vet. The Wild Bunch shenanigans are well orchestrated and the twists in the tale well executed.What's weird is the odd mixture of techniques and ideas that get thrown in. At one point slo-mo is used to track flying bullets. Elsewhere fantasy flashbacks occur, interior damage caused by bullets is animated, cows explode, heads roll, jokes come thick and fast. This film has everything. I'm just not entirely convinced that it should have everything. Despite the usual ultra-violence Clooney still manages to have the kind of sex with a woman where she doesn't take off either her knickers or her bra and he doesn't even bother with a stunt butt. They just do it in their clothes and presumably no bodily fluids are ever secreted, let alone exchanged. Seconds later limbs fly, blood gouts, killing occurs. You have to admit it's a funny old world, don't you? No genitals allowed but might consider it if they are briefly shown whilst being shot off in military action. No wonder the world's screwed up.So in summary this is a completely deranged film with a worthwhile message that many will miss. It uses many interesting and innovative techniques. The adventure is adventurous. Clooney is cool. It's absurdly funny in places. It's a mess. It didn't ought to work but it does.

The acting, plot, and dialog are all cheesy and superficial, but behind that is something legitimately engaging, worthy, even wondrous. Barabarella *is* creative and has an abundance of striking images that--by virtue of weirdness, ridiculousness, creepiness, or sexiness--will stick with you if you are paying attention.The effects are massively low budget by today's standards it's more like you're watching a stage play than a film. But this stage play has scenery, costumes, and props that are often really gorgeous and interesting. You'll see hedonists smoking essence of man in the City of Night, the priests and architecture of that city, bizarre and disconcerting carnivorous dolls, the Excessive Machine and its hall scattered with the remains of ladies, and the psychedelic Chamber of Dreams.The movie has plenty of interesting concepts too, for which the comic is largely to thank. They are cheesily executed but still thought- provoking. The future has replaced physical sex with some weird psychic act. The galaxy is so peaceful that the only way to combat a terrorist is to dust off weapons found in an old museum. And we see a switcheroo on heaven and hell where the evil are exalted in the beautiful city and the good are exiled to wander around a bleary labyrinth.All of these things are wondrous to see. You just need a coping mechanism to deal with the fact that the dialogue is ridiculous and the acting is often lame--even Marcel Marceau. I found that I could just suspend judgement and go along for the ride. Maybe you can, zen-like, just ignore the embarrassment of it of it all. It's worth it.Did I mention that it's cheesy as hell? But this film is also sexy, fun, creepy, strange, gorgeous, and intriguing. Best watched horny and intoxicated on something or the other. You'll have a blast.
