[{"date":"19 August 2011","score":"","review":" Like Black Swan, another compelling masterpiece by Darren, Requiem For A Dream is a descent into madness. Only this is even more depressing, as the characters begin on a high (no pun intended) with there dreams seemingly close to their grasp and feeling great but end up plummeting down to the bottom thanks to addiction, with their dreams coming right down with them. Requiem For A Dream is a masterpiece by Darren Aronofsky, it combines everything often overlooked by other film-makers (visuals, sound etc.) to make an unforgettable film that punches you right in the stomach and eventually pushes through right after the credits roll.So what makes Requiem For A Dream so great? Well, firstly, it comes down to Darren's flawless direction. Just like Black Swan you feel as if you are going on a harrowing journey with the characters. Instead of just limply watching them, you feel almost as you're there with them. It is startlingly involving. Some of the visuals are very intense, the last half hour is dizzying in its intensity thanks to Darren's manic quick-cutting and Clint Mansell's incredible score. Darren also shows that he has balls by taking risks, the scene in which Ellen Burstyn goes crazy is incredibly well done and was quite risky in the way it was executed. Some might say the scene seemed daft or even quite funny, which is probably intentional, drugs may seem fun at first but they soon consume you like the fridge. Darren also makes clever use of split-screen which brings you even closer to the characters mental-state.Sound is a medium film-makers often over look, whether it be diegetic or not, Darren uses both to absorbing effect. Clint's score is a staggering masterpiece in itself, it's haunting and always gives me chills (though it doesn't when they use it on Britains Got Talent). In fact, music is almost always played over each scene which adds to the hypnotic nature of the film. Sometimes the music will change quite suddenly to give the effect of disorientation, making us as an audience dizzy and slightly insane (I am already). Darren uses diegetic sounds inventively as well, by often using them as a sting over quick cuts, like when the camera slowly zooms in to Ellen Burstyn and randomly cuts quickly off to her popping pills. Darren's inventive style really adds to the intensity of the film. It is edited perfection.Darren also shows off his writing skills along with the other man who wrote the novel. It perfectly demonstrates each characters descent into complete and utter madness to the point where the emotional barrel is over-flowing. The final scene made me nearly well-up and leaves you in complete awe as the credits roll up. Each character is written in detail as well, it's in-depth which is also why the whole film is so compelling and absorbing.Ellen Burstyn's performance is also incredible. She deserved that Oscar which Julia Roberts (looks like Coops ) robbed off Ellen. What i don't like about the Oscars is the way they don't go on performance but on nationality or if you've won one already. I'm guessing because Ellen had already won one, they weren't giving her another. I'm sorry but Ellen completely deserved it, her performance is so compelling and realistic. It's obvious that she put a lot of work into her character. In fact everyone puts on an excellent performance which is always great to see.Some people complain that Requiem For A Dream is far too depressing and leaves you feeling bad. I can guess that most of these people are American wanting a Hollywood happy ending. The sad truth is there is no happy ending to drug addiction, which is why Requiem For A Dream is frighteningly honest and truthful. Would it really be realistic if everyone recovered and all there dreams came true? No. If you want to stop, don't start. Although it has an 18 certificate for it's graphic use of drug-taking, shocking images, and sexually explicit images, I honestly think this film should be a 12. Those images are deliberately put there to shock people into not taking drugs, all minors should see this film.I always know if a film is good if I get chills at the end and I just awingly stare as the credits roll. I defy anyone to come out of Requiem For A Dream without feeling any emotion at all. Requiem For A Dream is simply a rare masterpiece. It's directing is flawless, with awe-inspiring music and visuals. It's painfully honest and truthful and a harrowing masterpiece. Films like this don't come around very often so make the most of it.

He really did some absolutely amazing stuff in the '60's and '70's, which I don't just like but I absolutely love, this movie included...only for its first half that is.In the end I just can't help feeling somewhat disappointed with this movie. It has such a great premise and the movie starts off more than promising enough but the movie half way through decides on being a drama, rather than a tense thriller, with some science-fiction tendencies. I understand the movie was trying to create some deeper meanings and underlying themes but it just didn't worked out too well, or interestingly. At least not to me.It's not like the movie is being bad during its second half, it's just not all that interesting. The movie headed into a direction I didn't wanted the movie to head in to. I was so in love with the movie its first half and the movie its main premise that I just couldn't help feeling disappointed with this movie, though again, the second half in itself really isn't bad. It left me however constantly waiting for a twist and dilemma to kick in but what the second half mostly does is showing how Rock Hudson is trying to adept to his new life and his new identity. Really not that interesting and it's then that the movie turns more into a much slower character drama, while the rest of the movie got build up as a tense, paranoid, thriller, with plenty of mystery- and great thriller potential in it. This could had been a movie in the vain of some great paranoid thrillers, such as Three Days Of The Condor, Marathon Man and John Frankheimer his own The Manchurian Candidate, or a great, suspenseful, Hitchcock thriller. Such a shame!But despite the disappointments and problems I have with this movie, it still remains a real great and interesting watch. Not only just interesting because of its great and original main premise but also also because of the way it got shot and directed by John Frankenheimer. People only think of the '70's when thinking about experimental camera-handling and storytelling but this style already already started out in the late '60's actually. This is an 1966 movie, so I'll have to say that this has got to be one of really early ones to use an experimental style, which Frankenheimer continued to work and expand on with his later movies, during the '60's and '70's, most notably.It's really a beautiful looking with some great and unusual camera-work, that often really puts you right in the middle of all the 'action'. It also deliberately got shot in black & white to add to the movie its overall atmosphere. The cinematography also actually received an Oscar nomination and it's really not hard to see why.Another thing that this movie really impresses with is its acting. All of its acting feels very natural, as if they weren't even working with a script but coming up with their lines naturally, as the movie went along. Even Rock Hudson, who was, lets fact it, somewhat of a soap opera type of actor is really great in his role and has to carry the movie for most part.And lets please not forget the great, early, Jerry Goldsmith musical score, that also suits the movie really well.A good movie, that could had been fantastic!

If you're looking for warmth or heart then it's best you stay away from this movie but if you want a brilliantly constructed story dealing with people who often don't get movies made about them then PULP FICTION is just for you. Yes, crime movies have always featured these type of violent men and women but no screenplay has ever gotten inside their head or tried to show what killers talk about while they're on the job. The dialogue is what really seals the deal on this film and it certainly deserved the Best Screenplay Oscar that it won. The stories are told out of order, which is always a tough way to tell a story because you can often confuse the viewer or make it so frustrating that the viewer just gives up. Tarantino's stories are so well structured that you never get confused as to what's going on and being able to see how some characters end up before we get to the actual ending, which in fact takes place earlier than the real ending works very well. There are so many classic scenes to be found in this movie but some of the highlights include a terrific dance sequence between Travolta and Thurman to a Chuck Berry classic, an adrenaline shot sequence and of course the classic Biblical quote delivered by Jackson. As great as the screenplay is it offered many people a jump to their career and this was certainly true for Travolta who really gets to shine here. When this movie was released it was considered his first great film in years and it gave that career and major boost but it's a shame he hasn't done more with it over the years. Jackson became known as that Bad Motherf&*&er, which perfectly sums up his performance.

PULP FICTION truly is a cult classic that delivers on the suspense, the laughs and it really just makes you feel as if you're looking in on a group of people who you'd normally never be in the same room with. Add the great soundtrack, the wonderful cinematography and some terrific homages to older movies and you've really got something original and special. Tarantino's influence of the crime flicks from the 70s and the Europeon crime films is so apparent yet he takes these moments and makes them his own.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"19 August 2011","score":"","review":" It seems like a lot of horror flicks take their character to space in one instalment or another. Hellraiser, Leprechaun, Jason Voorhees, Aliens...well that one might be a stretch. I don't know why anyone thinks that's a good idea but because this happens to feature one of the greatest slashers in film history, and because of one unique scene this is actually watchable. I think it does represent a definite downward spiral in the series. I think when New Line took over from Paramount for Jason Goes To Hell they lost sight of what this series is all about. I think fans and die hard Jason freaks would have came back twenty times to watch Jason slash his way through Crystal Lake but New Line insisted on changing that up. So here we are 450 + years in the future on the a ship named Grendal and Jason is loose and rampaging like he hasn't missed a beat. The concept isn't terrible, the cast is okay, Jason is still awesome, and I can even accept Uber-Jason and think it was kind of a cool spin however cheesy that is. But even with these things this is a really cheesy, campy, poorly made sci-fi flick. The special effects are simply awful, the beast thing that they shoot in the cargo hold before finding Jason is the worst piece of special effects I've ever seen (and I've watched some cheesy monster flicks.) Why not save the budget and take him back to Crystal Lake? Lexa Doig should be the lead scream queen of the film. There is great potential here for her character as the head of the research project in 2008 who inadvertently gets frozen with Jason for 450 years. Unfortunately Doig is completely underused and almost pointless to the story. Lisa Ryder is deliciously horrible (this is a good thing) as the cyborg\/android Kay-Em.

The one brilliant redeeming scene in this film is in the last fifteen minutes when they use a holographic scene of Crystal Lake to distract Jason complete with two young taut teenage campers stripping, smoking dope and tantalizing him.

Obviously this is one of Hitchcock's most famous movies and is considered a classic, but on re-examination one wonders if aside from the novelty of the concept of the film and it's reputation if it is really a very good movie after all.I won't go into the details of the plot too much, because it is unlikely you are reading reviews of this famous movie to find out what it is about. And if you are then there are hundreds of other reviews here that already give a rough outline of the plot. The core concept in Rear Window of having a story that plays out from events witnessed while looking in the neighbors' windows in a building across a courtyard or alleyway from one's own apartment is a great concept and that is really the best thing about this film. The sound and music are also quite good, especially impressive is the way we get just snippets of (often ambiguous) sound drifting in from the apartments across the way as we see what is happening inside them.Anyway, aside from the novel concept and some of the nice technical aspects of the film making, what are the problems with this movie? First of all, there is not really any reason to be suspicious about the murderer. Jimmy Stewart is convinced that the man murdered his wife, but he doesn't have any reason to believe anything like that happened and neither do we the audience. And this is true well over an hour into the movie, so it is just boring. Then in the end his theory turns out to have been magically true... so what? It was still boring, and all that happened was it stopped making sense when the man turned out to have murdered his wife even though there was no evidence or reason for any suspicion whatsoever that he had done so.One thing that doesn't help the movie is that Jimmy Stewart was extremely poorly cast. He is about ten years too old for the relationship with Grace Kelly to play out the way it should, and he hardly fits the bill of a globe trotting adventure photographer. I love Jimmy Stewart, but this role needed an actor who was younger and less pedestrian in personality.Well, those two things pretty much ruin the movie. The plot is implausible at best and having an implausible lead actor doesn't make it any better. Perhaps in the 1950s audiences were naive enough to get in on the idea of 'suspicion' about this man who murdered his wife, but when you look at the movie today he is just a man living his life there is no reason to believe he did anything wrong at all and that ruins the suspense of the movie and makes it pretty strange to watch for the first eighty or ninety minutes. The characters don't make any sense, because you can't understand why they are buying into this idea that the guy 'over there' murdered his wife when there is literally no reason whatsoever to have any suspicion (that they know of or that we the audience know of) until the movie is already almost over. Personally, as a viewer, I could not get into a 'suspension of disbelief' for this plot and that made the viewing extremely tedious.Like I said, I love Hitchcock and had considered this to be a classic movie from what I remembered when I saw it as a child, but it hasn't aged well.

It is deemed, by most therein, that the woman was a great girl; a wonderful person and really good at her job &#x96; a woman who was really on top of things at the time of her death, and yet it appears was careless enough to be doing something around sixty, late at night and on a rain-sodden road having had the odd drink and on a stretch of track notorious for a certain deadly bend. Such stark differences between assumed sentiments and gruff realities having taken a good look at the situation are at the core of True Crime; a film driven by the force of Eastwood both on the screen and off it, in what is a film all about murky underestimations combating with hard-up truths. Fittingly, it is a film about a man placed into the same situation as the aforementioned deceased young journalist; a situation that has already run its course in terms of trials, allegations and musings although doesn't necessarily come out infallible to meaner, stone-wall truths which our lead eventually comes to suspect are omnipresent.Eastwood's character is Steve Everett, a California based journalist with years of experience but a debilitating marriage and a wavy track record of cracking open big stories though making bogus claims when all appeared right to him. The character is one of those old and wily, without necessarily being particularly nice, archetypes of movies of old whom just have that natural gift of being able to work their way through grisly problems and to both spot and comprehend things no one else seemingly can. He enjoys a drink and the company of a younger woman, whilst symptomatically struggles with his wife and infant daughter. His credentials are somewhat impressive, in that he managed to expose political sleaze, in spite of his own lifestyle, more broadly linked to that of the town's mayor, although the attempting to prove a rapist's innocence prior to their controversial confession was an instance in which his ability failed him.He works for that of a hotshot journalist chief named Alan Mann, played in that spitfire fashion by James Woods; a character of whom we are introduced to by way of a long tracking shot down and through the corridors of his building, as he spouts everything he needs to say - the scene concluding in his office which is rife with qualifications and journal covers of past newsworthy events. The case Everett ends up inheriting is that of the reporting on the execution of an African American individual who was given the death penalty for a store robbery and murder. He is Frank Beechum; a man, like Everett, with a wife and infant daughter and is played with effective understated regret by Isaiah Washington. Beechum is due to be killed via lethal injection in a few hours time, immediately rendering what eventually formulates as the crux of the film as a dramatic race against time &#x96; the manner in which he will be killed is somewhat agonisingly outlined to us with a measured precision by the warden and his staff, in that we are granted access to the chamber; steal a glance at all the switches and buttons and realise the magnitude of the situation. Additionally, the sheer chasm between the staff there and the likes of Everett, in regards to law enforcers or those of whom merely seek justice, is made prominent when one staff members shrugs upon being asked for an opinion and allows Beechum's court verdict to stand for his stance.The core of the film is Everett's attempt at uncovering something a little more concrete on why it is one would suspect Beechum of innocence; Eastwood doing really well to keep the film moving along, even if we don't necessarily buy into him as the sort of character Everett is - a younger, more aggressive presence in the mould of what Woods pulls off perhaps required. The film carries somewhat of a Bad Lieutenant vibe to it, as this tale of a man with some considerable power and questionable priorities charges through a world attempting to get to the bottom of proceedings plays out. Despite this, the film arrives with much more of a grounded; more accessible procession to it, and veers away from a more hardened edge of anti-heroism and such to the point that it perhaps required to be more dramatic and more biting.The film's element of its lead and his race against the clock is clumsily surmised every so often with inert insertions into proceedings of compositions of clocks or clock faces in some form; a persistent reminder that time is indeed running out, and an element overall which, try as it might, does not necessarily feel as prominent as it might have. In spite of what's at stake, there appears very little on the urgency scale and it lacks a wounding, cut-and-thrust dynamic which may have worked really well. Principally, Everett fights for a truth which will allow a victimised man to return to his wife and young daughter, as he himself disparagingly neglects that of what he has in that exact form. Running on this theme of redemption or righting wrongs, it is an opportunity for him to correct what happened in regards to that case of the misjudged rapist from years gone by; the film functional without necessarily being overly involved, a film which isn't necessarily dull but is safe, uninspiring fare which happens to conclude with the sort of sequence Robert Altman was actually sending up mere years previously in his Hollywood satire The Player. Whoops.

The character is one of those old and wily, without necessarily being particularly nice, archetypes of movies of old whom just have that natural gift of being able to work their way through grisly problems and to both spot and comprehend things no one else seemingly can. He enjoys a drink and the company of a younger woman, whilst symptomatically struggles with his wife and infant daughter. His credentials are somewhat impressive, in that he managed to expose political sleaze, in spite of his own lifestyle, more broadly linked to that of the town's mayor, although the attempting to prove a rapist's innocence prior to their controversial confession was an instance in which his ability failed him.He works for that of a hotshot journalist chief named Alan Mann, played in that spitfire fashion by James Woods; a character of whom we are introduced to by way of a long tracking shot down and through the corridors of his building, as he spouts everything he needs to say - the scene concluding in his office which is rife with qualifications and journal covers of past newsworthy events. The case Everett ends up inheriting is that of the reporting on the execution of an African American individual who was given the death penalty for a store robbery and murder. He is Frank Beechum; a man, like Everett, with a wife and infant daughter and is played with effective understated regret by Isaiah Washington. Beechum is due to be killed via lethal injection in a few hours time, immediately rendering what eventually formulates as the crux of the film as a dramatic race against time &#x96; the manner in which he will be killed is somewhat agonisingly outlined to us with a measured precision by the warden and his staff, in that we are granted access to the chamber; steal a glance at all the switches and buttons and realise the magnitude of the situation. Additionally, the sheer chasm between the staff there and the likes of Everett, in regards to law enforcers or those of whom merely seek justice, is made prominent when one staff members shrugs upon being asked for an opinion and allows Beechum's court verdict to stand for his stance.The core of the film is Everett's attempt at uncovering something a little more concrete on why it is one would suspect Beechum of innocence; Eastwood doing really well to keep the film moving along, even if we don't necessarily buy into him as the sort of character Everett is - a younger, more aggressive presence in the mould of what Woods pulls off perhaps required. The film carries somewhat of a Bad Lieutenant vibe to it, as this tale of a man with some considerable power and questionable priorities charges through a world attempting to get to the bottom of proceedings plays out. Despite this, the film arrives with much more of a grounded; more accessible procession to it, and veers away from a more hardened edge of anti-heroism and such to the point that it perhaps required to be more dramatic and more biting.The film's element of its lead and his race against the clock is clumsily surmised every so often with inert insertions into proceedings of compositions of clocks or clock faces in some form; a persistent reminder that time is indeed running out, and an element overall which, try as it might, does not necessarily feel as prominent as it might have. In spite of what's at stake, there appears very little on the urgency scale and it lacks a wounding, cut-and-thrust dynamic which may have worked really well. Principally, Everett fights for a truth which will allow a victimised man to return to his wife and young daughter, as he himself disparagingly neglects that of what he has in that exact form. Running on this theme of redemption or righting wrongs, it is an opportunity for him to correct what happened in regards to that case of the misjudged rapist from years gone by; the film functional without necessarily being overly involved, a film which isn't necessarily dull but is safe, uninspiring fare which happens to conclude with the sort of sequence Robert Altman was actually sending up mere years previously in his Hollywood satire The Player.

It is deemed, by most therein, that the woman was a great girl; a wonderful person and really good at her job &#x96; a woman who was really on top of things at the time of her death, and yet it appears was careless enough to be doing something around sixty, late at night and on a rain-sodden road having had the odd drink and on a stretch of track notorious for a certain deadly bend.

Released in 1990, the story involves Lt. Dunbar (Kevin Costner), a Civil War hero, singlehandedly manning a desolate prairie post in South Dakota. He becomes intrigued by his Native American neighbors, a small tribe of Lakota Sioux, and slowly develops good relations with them. He ultimately adopts a Sioux name - Dances With Wolves - and assimilates with the tribe. When the U.S. Army discovers his actions he is treated as a treasonous deserter. Mary McDonnell and Graham Greene have key roles. This is, simply put, filmmaking of the highest order. Everything magically works in this absolutely engaging 3-hour epic Western. The extended director's cut is an hour longer and most of the added material is worthwhile and fleshes out the characters more than the theatrical cut. I recommend watching the 3-hour version and, if you want more, check out the expanded version.Over the years I've heard some grumbling about the film's PC-influenced negative portrayal of whites in general and also its supposed romanticized portrayal of Indians as super-virtuous. Hence, before viewing the film again I was braced for the worst. After seeing it, I must say that most of these grumblings are hogwash. No kidding. Really, only a rigid white redneck patriot would take offense to this story (and, don't get me wrong, I'm patriotic but not mindlessly so). The film rings of authenticity and the characters are anything but one-dimensional. Want proof? (No major spoilers).- The Pawnee are the first Indians the viewer encounters in the film and they are portrayed as completely hostile to whites and other NA tribes - so hostile that they'll kill a white person on sight without mercy. I'd say this is a negative, stereotypical portrayal of Indians, wouldn't you agree? - Also, Wind In His Hair (Rodney A. Grant) clearly states that the Sioux should kill Dunbar at the council meeting; I'm sure there were others who agreed with him but it was ultimately decided that killing Dunbar would likely cause more problems than solve.- Not all white people are shown in a negative light; in fact, Dunbar himself - the film's protagonist - is white. What about the foul guy, Timmons, who escorts Dunbar to the abandoned fort? I've met people just like him. He's not portrayed as evil, but merely uncouth in dress and manners. Anyway, when Timmons gets savagely murdered by a band of Pawnee he begs over and over that the Indians not hurt his mules; his dying words are words of love (for his animals!). Also, when he says goodbye to Dunbar at the fort he says, Good luck, Lieutenant and you know he means it; the words show love and respect. Obviously this was a disgusting guy with a heart of gold. Again I know people just like him; it rings of authenticity.- The story takes place during the Indian Wars where there's very little love & compassion of whites towards Indians and vice versa. The U.S. Army is there to do a job and, as usual, go by the book. Is this a negative portrayal or simply the way it was? The answer is obvious. Hence, most of the officers are not shown in a negative light but merely as military leaders carrying out their duty. Although some of the main enlisted soldiers come off as clueless sheetheads, again, the characters ring of true life. I met people just like 'em in the military.- Besides, I repeat, not all Natives are depicted as virtuous. The Pawnee are obviously ruthless villains and quite a few Indians are shown helping the U.S. Army and are, therefore, traitors to their people.- Is the small tribe of Lakota Sioux really super-virtuous? Is their lifestyle really a paradise? No, they're merely portrayed as real people living, pursuing happiness, uncertain about the amassing whites, fighting and persevering through hardships (like the winter camp).- Is the massive annihilation of Bison (leaving their skinless carcasses to rot in the sun) a negative depiction of whites or just the way it was? Such people would likely shoot a wolf for the fun of it. Again, it smacks of reality.This is just a taste. Clearly, the people in the film are not as one-dimensional as some maintain.

It's more complicated than that.As to the accuracy of the story itself, the fact is that many whites have gone injun and many Natives have assimilated with whites.

Is it unlikely that this band would have an available good-looking white woman amongst them that Dunbar could fall in love with? Is there a bit of romanticization? Yes, but it IS a Hollywood movie, after all.

They soon discover that highly evolved apes rule the planet while humans are disdained animals. WHAT WORKS First of all, Charlton Heston is outstanding as the disillusioned humanity-hating Taylor. Taylor is brilliantly put in the ironic position of representing humankind to the apes. Although I love Heston in other films like Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments, I believe Taylor is his best role and performance. Heston was, incidentally, 43 years old at the time of filming. He's utterly captivating in the role and charismatic in an anti-hero sense.The first 35 minutes of the film involve the crashland, the search over the wastelands, the discovery of primitives and, finally, the potent cornfield revelation. This segment is one of my favorite parts of the film. The desert wastelands are awe-inspiring and one can't help but enjoy Taylor's amusingly pessimistic antics. This part of the film is highly mysterious in nature. Where ARE they? Why are there so few signs of life? Did Taylor hate humanity so much that he was literally willing to escape his home world? Who made the strange X-shaped scarecrows? Why can't the primitive cavemen speak? Who planted the crops of corn?When the story shifts to the ape city the film takes on an entirely different vibe. There's suddenly no more mystery and the shift is so jarring that the film momentarily loses its captivating sense of awe. No matter, the viewer is soon engulfed in the social dynamics of the ape society.The rough-hewn, alien-looking rock city sets are marvelous and the ape make-up is exceptional considering the time period. In fact, it holds up pretty well even to this day.It is soon discovered that the apes have three distinct races The chimps are scientific, humanitarian and pacifistic; the gorillas are militaristic; and the orangutans are the respected elders & religious leaders. The attention to detail of the ape society, and the social dynamics thereof, is nothing less than brilliant. The apes have their own distinctive walk and the actors do a splendid job depicting facial expressions through all that make-up, giving life to their characters.The story's characters are distinctly fleshed-out and superbly performed by all involved Nova, the animal-like primal beauty (Linda Harrison). Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), who are willing to risk everything for the sake of the truth and their ideals. Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evens), the defender of the apes' religious faith and protector of their society. Heck, even the secondary characters are great, like the chimp teenager Lucius and the gorilla jailguard Julius.Although Dr. Zaius is portrayed as an antagonist, it's impossible to hate him. One ascertains that he only acts in the best interest of the apes. He's very learned and, although he doesn't know or believe everything about Taylor and humankind in general, he does know that humans were once the dominant species of the planet, ages ago, but they foolishly destroyed themselves and their great society. He knows very well that the apes have this same destructive potential so he does everything in his power to protect the community he knows and loves. Note how Cornelius and Zira regard Zaius with the reverence and respect at all times, even when they are fugitives and Taylor has Zaius captive. This shows their humility and respectfulness. Also notice that, at the very end, right before Taylor and Nova depart down the shoreline on the horse, Zaius suddenly has it in his power to stop and even kill Taylor, but he DOESN'T. He lets them go. Why? I believe this reveals his good character and shows that he's not a villain at all. He knew Taylor could have easily killed him numerous times when he had the upper hand, so he mercifully returns the favor -- to an animal no less! Also, consider this Although Zaius is shown in a negative light by hindering scientific efforts to discover historical truth, the Lawgiver's scriptures that he quotes from are RIGHT -- humans ARE destructive & made a desert of parts of the planet and, for the sake of ape society, should not be allowed to breed in great numbers. Zaius obviously feels that the apes, in general, can't handle the truth. The climax is incredible (SPOILER ALERT!) Taylor and Nova travel a LONG distance down the shoreline while the viewer hears eerie music on the soundtrack. Something's just not right; it's too quiet and uneventful. There's no way it's gonna end like this. And then, suddenly, the truth about the planet of the apes is revealed. Utterly dumbfounded, Taylor jumps off his horse and furiously pounds his fists into the surf while screaming curses at humanity.Also, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is PERFECT -- fittingly eerie and primal.WHAT DOESN'T WORK Sometimes the apes' mouths don't move enough when they speak and it clearly looks artificial. Also, there are a few corny elements of dialogue and the social commentary is occasionally tacky.The only real plothole is that the apes speak English (!), which means this couldn't be another planet, unless it's perhaps another dimension with certain parallels. FINAL ANALYSIS This is a great science-fiction film, even though it's well over forty years old. Every time I see it I re-discovered certain things and see others for the first time! I should also point out that Planet of the Apes is very adult-oriented (even though kids will, of course, appreciate many aspects of it). Although there is quite a bit of action, it is by no means an action flick. It's primarily a dialogue-driven sci-fi adventure. Lastly, this film and its sequel Beneath the Planet of the Apes (which is technically the only sequel) should be viewed as ONE long film\/story.

Also, consider this Although Zaius is shown in a negative light by hindering scientific efforts to discover historical truth, the Lawgiver's scriptures that he quotes from are RIGHT -- humans ARE destructive & made a desert of parts of the planet and, for the sake of ape society, should not be allowed to breed in great numbers. Zaius obviously feels that the apes, in general, can't handle the truth. The climax is incredible (SPOILER ALERT!) Taylor and Nova travel a LONG distance down the shoreline while the viewer hears eerie music on the soundtrack. Something's just not right; it's too quiet and uneventful. There's no way it's gonna end like this. And then, suddenly, the truth about the planet of the apes is revealed. Utterly dumbfounded, Taylor jumps off his horse and furiously pounds his fists into the surf while screaming curses at humanity.Also, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is PERFECT -- fittingly eerie and primal.WHAT DOESN'T WORK Sometimes the apes' mouths don't move enough when they speak and it clearly looks artificial. Also, there are a few corny elements of dialogue and the social commentary is occasionally tacky.The only real plothole is that the apes speak English (!), which means this couldn't be another planet, unless it's perhaps another dimension with certain parallels. FINAL ANALYSIS This is a great science-fiction film, even though it's well over forty years old. Every time I see it I re-discovered certain things and see others for the first time! I should also point out that Planet of the Apes is very adult-oriented (even though kids will, of course, appreciate many aspects of it). Although there is quite a bit of action, it is by no means an action flick. It's primarily a dialogue-driven sci-fi adventure.

","genre":"Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"19 August 2011","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" THE PLOT George Taylor and two other astronauts experience some type of time warp in space and crashland on a distant planet over 2000 years in the future. They soon discover that highly evolved apes rule the planet while humans are disdained animals. WHAT WORKS First of all, Charlton Heston is outstanding as the disillusioned humanity-hating Taylor. Taylor is brilliantly put in the ironic position of representing humankind to the apes. Although I love Heston in other films like Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments, I believe Taylor is his best role and performance. Heston was, incidentally, 43 years old at the time of filming. He's utterly captivating in the role and charismatic in an anti-hero sense.The first 35 minutes of the film involve the crashland, the search over the wastelands, the discovery of primitives and, finally, the potent cornfield revelation. This segment is one of my favorite parts of the film. The desert wastelands are awe-inspiring and one can't help but enjoy Taylor's amusingly pessimistic antics. This part of the film is highly mysterious in nature. Where ARE they? Why are there so few signs of life? Did Taylor hate humanity so much that he was literally willing to escape his home world? Who made the strange X-shaped scarecrows? Why can't the primitive cavemen speak? Who planted the crops of corn?When the story shifts to the ape city the film takes on an entirely different vibe. There's suddenly no more mystery and the shift is so jarring that the film momentarily loses its captivating sense of awe. No matter, the viewer is soon engulfed in the social dynamics of the ape society.The rough-hewn, alien-looking rock city sets are marvelous and the ape make-up is exceptional considering the time period. In fact, it holds up pretty well even to this day.It is soon discovered that the apes have three distinct races The chimps are scientific, humanitarian and pacifistic; the gorillas are militaristic; and the orangutans are the respected elders & religious leaders. The attention to detail of the ape society, and the social dynamics thereof, is nothing less than brilliant. The apes have their own distinctive walk and the actors do a splendid job depicting facial expressions through all that make-up, giving life to their characters.The story's characters are distinctly fleshed-out and superbly performed by all involved Nova, the animal-like primal beauty (Linda Harrison). Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), who are willing to risk everything for the sake of the truth and their ideals. Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evens), the defender of the apes' religious faith and protector of their society. Heck, even the secondary characters are great, like the chimp teenager Lucius and the gorilla jailguard Julius.Although Dr. Zaius is portrayed as an antagonist, it's impossible to hate him. One ascertains that he only acts in the best interest of the apes. He's very learned and, although he doesn't know or believe everything about Taylor and humankind in general, he does know that humans were once the dominant species of the planet, ages ago, but they foolishly destroyed themselves and their great society. He knows very well that the apes have this same destructive potential so he does everything in his power to protect the community he knows and loves. Note how Cornelius and Zira regard Zaius with the reverence and respect at all times, even when they are fugitives and Taylor has Zaius captive. This shows their humility and respectfulness. Also notice that, at the very end, right before Taylor and Nova depart down the shoreline on the horse, Zaius suddenly has it in his power to stop and even kill Taylor, but he DOESN'T. He lets them go. Why? I believe this reveals his good character and shows that he's not a villain at all. He knew Taylor could have easily killed him numerous times when he had the upper hand, so he mercifully returns the favor -- to an animal no less! Also, consider this Although Zaius is shown in a negative light by hindering scientific efforts to discover historical truth, the Lawgiver's scriptures that he quotes from are RIGHT -- humans ARE destructive & made a desert of parts of the planet and, for the sake of ape society, should not be allowed to breed in great numbers.

Like the famous movie tag line Maximus is the general who became a slave, a slave who became a gladiator, a gladiator who defied an emperor. It has been little more than 11 years since this movie was made and its influences and precedents are legion. More than that, it may yet be the best of all the historic Roman movies (Ben Hur, Spartacus, etc).For one, the character Maximus is a great expression of the Athenian Ideal. He is a citizen soldier, trusted leader of one of Rome's greatest armies. He serves Rome because, in Maximus' own words, he has seen much of the rest of the world, which is brutal and dark - Rome is the light. He believes in Rome and in its exalted leader, Caesar Marcus Aurelius. Maximus' defining characteristic is love - love of country, love of Caesar, and most importantly love of his family. He does not seek power nor influence, he only wishes to do his duty with honor. Russell Crowe fleshes out this character expertly, and brings a quiet soul to a very violent life. Winning the Oscar for his performance understates how timeless and beautiful an acting job he gave.His antagonist, Commodus, is quite the opposite. While Marcus Aurelius pointedly prefers Maximus, he spurns Commodus from assuming the throne because of his weakness and immorality. Joaquin Phoenix deliciously plays the corrupt and vile Commodus and creates one of the great 'characters-you-love-to-hate'. When the movie was still playing in theaters the common review I heard was 'but I hated Joaquin Phoenix'. I would ask why, and the response usually centered around how 'creepy' or 'slimy' he was. Joaquin made the villain so sinister he made us hate him, as we were meant to. Connie Nielsen gives a heartfelt and stoic turn as Lucilla, who in many ways reflects the broken heart of Rome and its hope that it can be whole again.Most movies, particularly in the modern era, tend to cast antagonist and protagonist as very similar in character and ideology save one critical, large difference. Here, 'Gladiator' gives us polar opposites Maximus the general who fights for honor and love and idealism, Commodus who schemes and lusts for self-serving power. It makes for an extremely compelling script with a venerated supporting cast, many of whom were already well-established classical actors such as Richard Harris, Derek Jacoby, and Oliver Reed. They bring gravitas to small but critical roles and supply the weight of Roman political intrigue.Enough cannot be said for Ridley Scott's vision and direction. In so many ways, the movie is an accurate portrayal of Roman history, and in others a wild fantasy of it. He paints a grand and imposing visage of ancient Rome that is as much a character in the movie as any actor. It gives scope to the stakes Maximus and Commodus are playing for. Stylistically, the influence of this movie has oft been repeated, but never duplicated. The violence is simultaneously brutal and vague, bloody and implied. The cinematography is at times elegant and vicious, still and harried. Its a great blend that keeps your eyes glued to the screen and leaves a thin, glossy veneer that elevates the movie above slasher B-flick violence, which is precisely what gladiator fighting was. The gray tones of Germania, the warm sepia tones of Trujillo, the bright granite of Rome - a wonderful color palette that Ridley paints with to perfection. I especially like many of the Rome scenes that mix shots in half-shadow, half-light underscoring the divided, dark nature of the Roman empire.Its a stylistically transcendent and progressive movie of conscience and soul that tells a very old, classical tale. Many professional musician friends of mine did not like Hans Zimmer's music score at all, but I disagree. Its simplistic and stirring and fits the movie perfectly. It cues the audience into the horror, the tension, and the grandeur that was ancient Rome. This movie will endure because it has a timeless soul and is told artfully and truthfully. I have seen many of the 50s\/60s period epics that are so revered, but I do not think they will stand the test of time as well as Gladiator will. To me, a product of post-modern cinema, those movies do not connect emotionally nor historically. Ridley Scott brought an historic grittiness to 'Gladiator' that I think will endure and, consequently, was one of the forerunners to the last ten years of cinema where movies are now revered for their gritty accuracy, rather than their bubble gum ignorance of it. Like the conflict between Maximus and Commodus, 'Gladiator' is a refined study in balance and conflict and threads this needle expertly with as poetic an ending in movies as you'll ever see.

Breen (Julian Glover) and Prof. Quatermass (Andrew Keir) are put in charge of the operation and draw completely different conclusions about the discovery Breen ludicrously believes it's a German propaganda weapon from WWII, whereas Quartermass concludes that it's a martian spacecraft that incredibly explains the origins of the human species (!), not to mention so-called myths about the devil, demons, gargoyles and various other occultic items. Unearthing the object turns out to be a big mistake because it lets loose a malevolent supernatural force that starts to possess the populace (!End Spoiler!).I remember seeing Five Million Years to Earth a handful of times growing up and I never failed to be enthralled by the creepy and thought-provoking events of the story. Viewing it recently, I was interested to see how well it would hold up in the new millennium and if it could still inspire and maintain my fascination now that I'm an adult. Well, it holds up quite well, and I still found it thought-provoking, spooky and fairly fascinating. Yes, the clothing is decidedly dated, and naturally so, but that adds to the charm. Some complain about the dated special effects but -- c'mon -- this was made in the mid-60s! I feel the F\/X hold up quite well and don't detract from the story at all.

Thankfully, the series made up for it with the outstanding Rambo in 2008, which was totally serious, deep and non-cartooney.Most people reading this know the plot (PLOT SPOILER!) Vietnam vet John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) drifts into a Rocky Mounain town looking for a war buddy, only to learn that he died due to exposure to Agent Orange the summer before. The town's sheriff (Brian Dennehy) tries to steer Rambo out of town and ends up arresting him. Big mistake because Rambo is an ex-Green beret, a virtual one-man-army. He easily escapes into the local forests where he takes on both the police and the National Guard in jungle warfare. Before all is said and done he almost levels the entire town! The picture was filmed in beautiful Hope and Golden Ears Provincial Park, British Columbia. Yes, it's drizzly and dreary with absolutely zero sunshine, but it's incredibly picturesque nevertheless. A wonderful place to commit suicide I'm sure (jk).Dennehy is perfect as the arrogant, pushy and intimidating sheriff. He essentially plays the same role in the Western Silverado (1985) albeit the character in that film is ten-times WORSE.Stallone is physically in his prime here, although he's not as bulked-up as in the two sequels. In fact, he's almost skinny. His waist is obviously only about 27-28 inches and his chest isn't all that big, although his arms and shoulders are certainly impressive. Anyway, one good byproduct of seeing First Blood is that it'll inspire guys to get back in shape (or get in better shape).Stallone sort of blows his initial lines talking to the black woman about his war buddy at the beginning, but aside from this he's outstanding in the role of Rambo. He doesn't have many lines; most of his acting is non-verbal. At the end Rambo finally screams out and lets out all his pent-up rage. This is a potent scene. He screams Over there (in Vietnam) I was in charge of million dollar equipment, over here I can't even hold a job PARKING CAAAARRRRRRSSSSS!!!!! I'm not normally into DVD commentaries and rarely blow the time to listen to them, but the one featured on the Special Edition DVD (the one with the red cover) by writer David Morrell is truly worthwhile. Morrell talks the entire 90-minute length of the film and offers a wealth of information, like the differences between the film and his novel, how the film set many precedents in the action\/adventure film genre, the incredible way he came up with the name Rambo, the 3-Act story structure of films, etc. Make no mistake, David Morrell is a genius.It doesn't matter how many times you've seen First Blood.

It's by no means a bad film, but there are those who have pronounced it as the funniest film ever made, which I find quite ridiculous in the face of films like 'The Ladykillers' (Alec Guiness version of course). This film relies on it's comedy from one of the oldest gags in the book, namely two blokes dressing up as women. Granted they do a good job of it, but there is nothing original here. Marilyn Monroe is a pain, and Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis have had better starring roles. I have persevered over a period of time trying to like this film, but in the end I had to be true to myself so I passed my video on to someone else who would far better appreciate it.
