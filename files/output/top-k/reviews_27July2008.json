I remembered watching this movie and loving it as a little kid when i picked it up the other day at HMV for 6.00, and now when i look back on those days i wonder, what the hell was rubbed in my eyes and ears? This movie has some really cheesy puns and terrible dialog, the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and the CGI is some of the worst i have ever seen. I cannot believe that i never noticed how bad the CGI was in this movie. The movie was allot different from the television show but i never noticed how different it was because i guess when i was little i didn't listen to movies. Ivan Ooze says he can't believe he missed the Brady bunch reunion in his slumber even though he had been asleep for 6000 years and last i heard, the Brady bunch wasn't around 600 years ago so he shouldn't have even heard of the original show. The villains don't look intimidating at all and I'm pretty sure lord Zed's helmet was made out of cheap plastic. Yet, i kept having flashbacks from when i was a kid when i watched this and since i loved it so much as a younger one, i still enjoyed the movie and loved to suddenly remember parts before they happened. Now onto the DVD itself. The design on the case and disc is nice, but the picture isn't very good in the movie and there's not really much extras. There's a terrible trailer and a making of featurette that has nothing to dowith the making of the movie and has one of the stars compare this film to star wars and the wizard of oz. Also i remember someone saying the Zord and massive Ivan fight on the streets looks really real and its the first movie to have that. I laughed out loud because that fight looked terrible and there were earlier monster movies that looked more realistic. I can't really recommend it to anyone that didn't watch the show or movie as a child and wish to see it again. I give it 2 and 1\/2 kitty cats out of 5 because although the dialog and effects are terrible, i still somewhat enjoyed it because of how much i loved it as a kid.

I saw it again recently, remembering that I thought it was OK but too slow. Also, I'm a bit more of a fan of science fiction films than I was when I was younger and figured I might be able to appreciate it more. I had a pretty good time but yet again found the film to have too low key a pace. The story is excellent, as is the script, by genre legend Dan O'Bannon and Miguel Tejada Flores. Apparently the film sticks fairly well to the Philip K. Dick source material, which I ain't read. Certainly it isn't a generic Hollywood whizz bang explosion laden mindless dreck fest. Instead the film strives for dingy atmosphere and lots of cool ideas and the script offers up bits of nice bleak humour as well as a good deal of general interest. As far as low budget science fiction goes, the writing is marvellous, though the pace is a tad lacking. The acting is strictly OK, apart from a nicely grizzled and world weary Peter Weller and his enthusiastic companion whose name eludes me at present no one stands out really. The actors all play their parts well, its just that they're generally kinda workmanlike, which is a shame because it doesn't bring the writing or the ideas to life as much as it should. Although I'm all for intelligence over action, I can't help but feel that with a cool adversary like the Screamers there should have been more action, or grue. They aren't really the focus of the film and are pretty underused. The opening is pretty neat and I would have liked more Screamer shenanigans in that vein. Having said that there are still various cool moments, especially involving disguised varieties. Director Christian Duguay does fine work with his budget, conjuring just the right bleak, dingy atmosphere, some good jolts and a handful of cool, imaginative action scenes. He treats the material with flair and respect and the film mostly doesn't patronise the audience with the kind of nonsense that comes in big budget science fiction, ie. the last half hour or so of I, Robot. Screamers does have a slightly silly climax, but it doesn't dissipate the goodwill that the bulk of the film builds up. Altogether, I have a lot of like and respect for this film. Its one of those films that does terrific given its budget and is well worth a look for science fiction fan. A wee bit slow but still recommended.

THe thing that manly clicked about this movie was the smoothness at which the director\/writer Mr. Shyamalan tells his story in just about 2 hours, which is well paced yet not too fast, unlike some movies that are very well made, but extended too much even after you feel that the story should have got over.I was utterly shocked during the end of this movie when I watched it the first time as I never thought of such a thing as most of the Bollywood movies are not thriller and very few of them have a mastermind of a writer like Shyamalan to have such a mind- boggling ending. That's probably one of the reason that he was presented the Padma Shree or Padma Bhushan award in India. I haven't seen his other films except for the Village which too was good but after this movie, I feel that he has rightfully been handed this award, unlike some people in India who expressed their displeasure when he was given this award. The reason why they felt it was unfair was because they had not seen this magnificent masterpiece.I was glad to know that it was a small budget film and did not contain exorbitant furniture or other accessories just to advertise the products or even a huge haunted mansion that would have made this a typical horror flick. This movie haunted me from within, than scaring me from outside or making me sick by showing people cutting other peoples' flesh etc. It was a wonderful psychological thriller with no fancy items to show how expensive the movie is. This movie had some of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history, like the sick girl's story and the iconic climax. It also had one of the best performances given by the actors. I would especially like to mention the little kid who acted so well that I was completely in amazement that he did this at the age of eleven. Bruce Willis too has done a commendable job and I thought that he would be worthy enough to get at least an Oscar nomination, which he didn't. The kid's mother too has done a very good job, especially in the emotional sequences but I felt that her make up was overdone and it made her look like an evil character.I think I'll sum it up by saying that this is one of the best thrillers I have watched.

Fortunately, that's not much! For the genre that it represents, it is excellent. As a movie, it is very, very good.The soundtrack, often imitated, never duplicated or surpassed; provides exaggerated suspense and unintentional comic relief through out the movie. It also creates an atmosphere and texture for the movie, that many other movies might benefit from.The camera work is good. There is lots of great scenery, rapid change ups from landscapes to close ups of the actor's faces; and other interesting use of the camera, at times. At other times, there is a lazy quality to the shot choice that highlights the movement or plot at the moment.The characters are archetypes, and as such, don't stray too much from their respective modes. There are moments when I wished for a bit more, but there was plenty of true to form moments from the major characters that made up for a lack of further development or dimensionality. Stark, interesting, comic, tragic (if you will) and intense. Good acting all around, with Eastwood giving a trademark performance, later to be more fully developed as Dirty Harry, as a comic and merciless but just defender of his own ethic.The film has some funny scenes, and also, it has some places where it starts to drags. It's 2 hours and 45 minutes long, so it does take a certain suspension of time to sit through it all. Worth it though! Especially, if you happen to like rough and rugged westerns. I think that Sergio Leone's brilliance is overlooked in the direction and screenplay of this movie. There is something so classically cheesy and yet at the same time universally comic and tragic about the unfolding of events.As an example, I was particularly struck by the scene in the graveyard where the three men are about to dual over the sum of $200,000 in gold coins. Truly a king's ransom. The interesting counter point being that it is a soldier's graveyard, and that most, if not all of those buried there died in the pursuit of much less then that.The ideas of greed, confusion and ignorance were also interestingly intermixed throughout the movie. While at the end of the movie money is given a gold star (so to speak) all the tragedy and malice throughout the rest of the movie can be tied directly to it.There is a fair amount of violence in this film, which counts against it. Over all, I have a very positive response after viewing this one. Thumbs up, and with the right people, those who might laugh along with me, I'd be happy to see this one again.Plot synopsis.At the beginning of the film we are introduced to the three major characters who are defined as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. The might as well have been introduced as The not so bad compared to a wolf; definitely Mean and the completely evil one. However, this would have robbed the movie of its pretensions to be a moral tale of some kind, or perhaps just obscured it's spiritual (?) message a bit deeper. Anyway.The three characters compete with one another to see how many people the can kill, or lives that they can ruin. The good guy starts out by killing three people, so he has a good start! As the movie progresses, we see them each killing various other people, and threatening to kill one another. Except for the good guy; his utterances are generally followed through with actions. Anyway.They each become aware of the existence of the some of gold earlier mentioned. Actually, the bad knows about the gold at the beginning of the film.Well, suffice it to say that there is a lot of shenanigans, and then at the end of the movie, there is a showdown. Lots of thematic mood music, and then each of the three gets their just desserts The Bad dies, The Ugly get stranded in a graveyard with his hands tied behind his back with more gold then he can carry at his feet; and the Good rides out of the graveyard with the other half of the gold. All the other stuff in the middle, is just plot devices, and chances for the characters to show their archetypes in action not worth repeating, save to say that it was easy to follow, entertaining, and epic in scope as it involved the United States civil war as a backdrop.

Fortunately, that's not much! For the genre that it represents, it is excellent. As a movie, it is very, very good.The soundtrack, often imitated, never duplicated or surpassed; provides exaggerated suspense and unintentional comic relief through out the movie. It also creates an atmosphere and texture for the movie, that many other movies might benefit from.The camera work is good. There is lots of great scenery, rapid change ups from landscapes to close ups of the actor's faces; and other interesting use of the camera, at times. At other times, there is a lazy quality to the shot choice that highlights the movement or plot at the moment.The characters are archetypes, and as such, don't stray too much from their respective modes. There are moments when I wished for a bit more, but there was plenty of true to form moments from the major characters that made up for a lack of further development or dimensionality. Stark, interesting, comic, tragic (if you will) and intense. Good acting all around, with Eastwood giving a trademark performance, later to be more fully developed as Dirty Harry, as a comic and merciless but just defender of his own ethic.The film has some funny scenes, and also, it has some places where it starts to drags. It's 2 hours and 45 minutes long, so it does take a certain suspension of time to sit through it all. Worth it though! Especially, if you happen to like rough and rugged westerns. I think that Sergio Leone's brilliance is overlooked in the direction and screenplay of this movie. There is something so classically cheesy and yet at the same time universally comic and tragic about the unfolding of events.As an example, I was particularly struck by the scene in the graveyard where the three men are about to dual over the sum of $200,000 in gold coins. Truly a king's ransom. The interesting counter point being that it is a soldier's graveyard, and that most, if not all of those buried there died in the pursuit of much less then that.The ideas of greed, confusion and ignorance were also interestingly intermixed throughout the movie. While at the end of the movie money is given a gold star (so to speak) all the tragedy and malice throughout the rest of the movie can be tied directly to it.There is a fair amount of violence in this film, which counts against it. Over all, I have a very positive response after viewing this one. Thumbs up, and with the right people, those who might laugh along with me, I'd be happy to see this one again.Plot synopsis.At the beginning of the film we are introduced to the three major characters who are defined as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. The might as well have been introduced as The not so bad compared to a wolf; definitely Mean and the completely evil one. However, this would have robbed the movie of its pretensions to be a moral tale of some kind, or perhaps just obscured it's spiritual (?) message a bit deeper. Anyway.The three characters compete with one another to see how many people the can kill, or lives that they can ruin. The good guy starts out by killing three people, so he has a good start! As the movie progresses, we see them each killing various other people, and threatening to kill one another. Except for the good guy; his utterances are generally followed through with actions. Anyway.They each become aware of the existence of the some of gold earlier mentioned. Actually, the bad knows about the gold at the beginning of the film.Well, suffice it to say that there is a lot of shenanigans, and then at the end of the movie, there is a showdown. Lots of thematic mood music, and then each of the three gets their just desserts The Bad dies, The Ugly get stranded in a graveyard with his hands tied behind his back with more gold then he can carry at his feet; and the Good rides out of the graveyard with the other half of the gold. All the other stuff in the middle, is just plot devices, and chances for the characters to show their archetypes in action not worth repeating, save to say that it was easy to follow, entertaining, and epic in scope as it involved the United States civil war as a backdrop. Entertaining, engrossing and in the final analysis a bit over worked and long. But very, very good nonetheless.May you reading this be well and happy.

Since when does that count as film? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, an aspiring 18-year-old dancer, who, incomprehensibly, has a job as a welder in a Pittsburgh steel factory. Not a line of work most older women find their way into, much less 18-year-olds fresh out of high school. Meanwhile, at night she works as an exotic dancer, who never actually takes off her clothes, in a greasy spoon bar called Mawby's. Yet looking at the well choreographed and well polished dance routines the girls do every night at Mawby's, you would think they were working at the best casino on the Las Vegas Strip.Alex ends up having a predictable romance with her boss, Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who is about twice her age. After resisting Nick's advances, because going out with the boss isn't a good idea, she wastes no time in going all the way with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job, which makes no sense given how it is likely to look to Alex's co-workers.When Beals isn't being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie, her character spends most her time throwing temper tantrums. Alex's dream is to get an invitation only audition at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably, when her boss\/boyfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of, she's throws one her tantrums. She angrily tells Nick she isn't doing the audition because of his intervention, and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making this.Of course, Alex does eventually get her audition at the Conservatory. She puts on a dance routine before the Conservatory board that is so ridiculous that you would think it was in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. Oh yeah, it is a dance routine in a movie marketed to the MTV generation.I don't think I can judge whether or not Beals can actually act well on the basis of what I saw in Flashdance. This is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written, that I don't think it is a fair litmus test of her acting abilities.You have to hand it to the makers of Flashdance though. This movie is proof that the poorest film making can be covered up by a slick marketing campaign. In this case a best selling and award winning soundtrack and music videos for said soundtrack in heavy rotation on MTV. If they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script, then they might have been able to come up with a plot and a story with characters that I cared about. Instead what we get are stock characters put in ridiculous scenes any viewer with a functioning brain can't take seriously. A truly forgettable film.

The accuracy to which the makers have given so much attention really takes us back in time, as if we're living in it.

But, Ivory really took good care and put a lot of heart into it. He skillfully balances all the ingredients. He must have loved the book to have his screenwriter, Jhabvala, adapt an excellent screenplay. Irrelevant subplots are carefully avoided and the characters are very well-etched. Howards End itself is a character and the house that was chosen to 'play' the title role is breathtaking. One can easily understand why Ruth Wilcox was attached to it and why the Schlegel sisters fall in love with it. The relationships are so wonderfully portrayed. The closeness between the Schlegel sisters and brother finely contrasts that between the Wilcoxs and also that between the Basts. While class distinction is an important theme, clichés and caricatures are cleverly avoided. The dialogues are sharp, witty, poetic and clever. The entire film has a very romantic appeal to it. And, to top it all, Richard Robbins's score is mesmerizing.With such a great cast like a snobbish but ambivalent Anthony Hopkins, a fragile and desperate Vanessa Redgrave, a fiery Helena Bonham Carter, a naive Sam West, a gentle motherly Prunella Scales and a host of brilliant supporting actors 'Howards end' shines.

Like a Chinese Robert Altman or Paul Thomas Anderson, Yang makes a sensitive, poignant and, at times, funny ensemble with a very peculiar pace and extraordinary tenderness. It's definitely a film to see more than once in order to fully appreciate its beauty and subtle, brilliant moments (like when Adriene Lin sings, or mumbles, to herself Shostakovich's Jazz Suite 2, the classical piece also wonderfully used in Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut).

He is remembered for his athletic achievement, political stances, and larger than life personality. Yet we never knew him. Michael Mann made a decent movie called Ali a few years ago. He tried his best to draw a portrait of an elusive human being. But what he was trying to achieve had already been done before with When We Were Kings.When We Were Kings is a phenomenal documentary. In my opinion, the prototype for all documentaries. Taking place in and around perhaps the best boxing match of all time, the Rumble In The Jungle, in which Ali faced George Foreman(of grill fame...). Ali is shown as a man brimming with confidence, yet his constant boasting becomes a coat of armor that protects him from his own self-doubt. Yet he endears himself to the African people who embrace him like he's one of their own. In these moments Ali appears both invincible and mortal.There are some cool musical numbers by James Brown and B.B King as well as appearances by Spike Lee, Don King, and the controversial president of Zahire at the time, Mobutu Sese Seko. These appearances add depth to the amazing events of the film.If you love documentaries, sports, or character stories, When We Were Kings is among the class of each.
