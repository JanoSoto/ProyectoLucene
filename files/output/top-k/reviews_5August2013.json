You will find yourself weeping, because how moving this movie is. The Green Mile is an amazing movie directed by Frank Darabont who knows a little bit about directing prison movies. His biggest claim to fame was 1994's Shawshank Redemption, a prison movie adapted from a Stephen King novel. So it was no surprise that Frank and Stephen King would once again team up to bring audiences another great movie. Can lightning strike in the same place twice? Yes! Set in the Deep South rather than the north this time, Green Mile takes place in Louisiana's prison during the Great Depression. The film really captured the era. Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecombe, a prison guard that works at a quarter of the prison whom job is to execute the inmates. The job is hard and tough. He became to question himself, and his job when a new inmate came named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a simple minded giant whom works more like a miracle worker than a murderer. I have to say what a great cast! Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey was amazing. The way he can pull the audience in, with his delivery is just spell bounding. I got his 'broken glasses' and 'he kill them with they love' speech. I think this encompasses a major theme, how people are ugly and cruel to each other, and justice is only sometimes given. Everything about him, speaks John Coffey from the way he handle miracles, and even the child like innocents when playing with a pet mouse name Mr. Jingles. David Morse as Brutus Brutal Howell is a great supporting character that helps Paul with his job. I really liked his performance as the strong- will, second in command officer. Then there is Dough Hutchison as Percy Whetmore - he plays a great weasel. He captured Percy's cowardice, arrogance, and violence perfectly as the crudest of the guards. Last, worth noting is Sam Rockwell. He was a little older than how I imagined the criminal Wild Bill to be. He did bring some good humor to the film. I do find the moon pie scene hilarious. A lot of critics have panned the film for not having realistic characters. The characterizations on the death row inmates don't really seems like they belong there. Honestly, does anybody think Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) even commit a crime? He seems way too old to be really a murderer, even Arlan Bitterbuck (Graham Greene) didn't seem so bad. Then you got Percy, the immature sadistic, racist, creep, painted here as being nothing less than 100% evil. Not 50% evil, not 80% evil. But 100% evil. Is that realistic? Is it? Does this guy have even a single redeeming feature? Nope, not one. So I'm not buying this guy either. The characters were way too good or just plan evil with little to no character development. I think it's OK to have film like that, and how the characters were portrayed, I think it was very accurate to the book. In the book, I had a hard time telling the other guards Harry (Jeffery DeMunn) and Dean (Barry Pepper) apart, so I'm glad in the movie, Dean was considerably older than Harry. The biggest change from the book is the racism in the South. I honestly think they toned it down in the movie, the n-word is used plenty of times in the book. Another thing that the movie didn't put was the short story about old Paul in Georgia Pines with a cruel employee that reminded him of Percy. Adding this to the movie would have made it too long, it was already three hours, but it definitely gave his elderly age some more depth. The movie did add some new things to help the film. I think the repeated visual of the light bulbs bursting during Coffey's bursts of power added to the story since we couldn't get inside of Paul's head. I also thought Coffey showing Paul what he saw as opposed to Paul going to investigate was a good move for the film - it shortened the film that was needed badly. Another thing that angry some critics, was the Christ like symbolism with John Coffey. People says it was too much messianic overtones in the story but it's absolutely ludicrous. As a Christian man, I wasn't offended by it. People need to be open to all beliefs to get this film. Once you get pass that, you find John Coffey to be a very interesting lovable guy, and you get emotional invested in him to the point that you cry when you see what happen in the end with his character. Then there are those people that mad because the movie is way too long. Not that that is always bad, but it didn't help things at all here. If this movie had been the standard flick, but I will defend this movie because the Green Mile is supposed to seem too long. It was even quote in the film. Anybody who read the book, should have known that. The music by Thomas Newman is amazing. It fits in with the mood of the film. Even the song from 1935's Top Hat work in this film. Overall I really enjoyed this movie. I can understand why it was nominated for a Best Picture at the Academy Awards. An amazing story. Sad emotional for sure, but a lot of great stories are. BTW- RIP Michael Clarke Duncan. You were a great actor.

However, there are certain scenes, thrills and aspects - e.g. the ending predicament that are actually pretty good and will throw you.Eddie Murphy plays a 'wisecracking' hostage negotiator, although tbh he's very much the 'serious' Eddie Murphy for most of the film. I prefer the fun Beverly Hills Cop guy, but there we go. There is a scene where he's talking about being in a thong and being seen by his mother's friends that is hilarious though. Plot-wise he basically gets on the wrong side of some nutter and his cousin and they conspire to make life hell for him and his English girlfriend. The female lead is a tad weak in this, and I must admit I've never ever heard of her (although I was 7 when this film came out - maybe she was big then) but she looked good - Carmen Ejogo she is.Michael Rapaport is in this as well, as an intelligent sniper who is paired up with Murphy. Now I thought, judging by the cover etc, this was gonna be a buddy cop movie but Rapaport (an actor I like) is underused really. Don't get me wrong he's in the film a fair bit but his character has next to no personality. All I learnt was he's polite, sharp, from the Swat team and is a sniper. That's it. The film could have been done without his character if they wanted to save whatever fee he commanded.Whoever plays Eddie Murphy and Carme Ejogo's dog is good in this though. Stellar, powerhouse performance reminded me of Hanks in The Green Mile or Orson Welles in Citizen Kane.So yeah, mixed bag really - there's hate for post-80s Murphy films sure, but this is one of the better ones. It's a solid watch (on netflix atm) and there's some good action and the bad guy is easy to hate, so there's a lot worse out there.

A surprisingly well written (and acted) film by two of today's biggest actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Matt Damon plays Will Hunting who is a genius trapped inside the body of a broken orphan, whose emotional damaged past has turned him into a reckless young adult. Will was a believable character with many quick, fluid, long-winded jabs that you would only expect out of the mouth of a well-read genius. His brilliance is discovered by Prof. Gerald Lambeau (Stellen Skarsgard), and leads him to meeting psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) and love interest Skylar (Minnie Driver). Will struggles to find himself, stuck within the disconnect from his past, but finds ways to cope through Sean, Skylar, and best friend Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck).The main theme of this film is being able to watch Will find connection with others and allow himself to trust and love someone else. As he progresses through the movie, we see him meet Skylar and evolve through the relationship. We also see his bond and relationship with Sean, grow and progress into respect, trust, and friendship. Another theme of the movie are the many arrays of sociological and psychological issues with every character. Will is constantly battling with his past and the ability to trust, we also see his aggression built up from all of this. Chuckie also has similar aggression issues that we are able to witness in the bar scenes, most likely these are sociological issues from how and where he grew up. Sean is secretly battling the loneliness after losing his wife and too stubborn to open up about it to someone and move on with his life. We later see that Professer Lambeau is upset that his life and reputation has not progressed as far as he would have liked and he has some pent up feelings about this. Another movie with this similar theme would be the recent, Silver Linings Playbook. The two main characters played by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, are struggling with themselves and their relationships. Yet you come to realize that they are not the only ones with these same inner struggles.The film techniques are well hidden yet are able to bring this movie to life in a very sneaky way. The scenes when Will visits Sean in his office are often allowing us to see the distance between the two's relationship. We only see one character at a time, or we just see the shoulder of Sean while the camera continues to focus on Will. Gradually as the movie progresses the two are both seen on screen together, portraying that Will's trust in Sean is growing.In the beginning of the movie we see a short scene of Will reading in his apartment. The camera slowly pulls back, allowing us to view the emptiness around him. This gives us an early look at how Will is in his life. He is alone and disconnected from others. The use of parallel cutting in the movie allows us to see everything going on at once with the characters. The most prominent of these scenes is at the end where the film cuts between Will leaving a note for Sean, Chuckie stopping to pick Will up from his house, and Sean packing up his things to leave. I think this parallel cutting technique is reminiscent of Will's life and how there are always many things going on in that great mind of his. This movie as a whole is a very realistic and thorough story of a brilliant young man, with a troubling past, who is trying to find himself and allow others to find him. I would highly recommend this film to anyone trying to find one of the best written and acted films of our generation.

A brilliant trick which evoke the memory of Vertigo and La Jetèe in the viewers mind, and thereby plant a memory just like in the mind of the main characters of these films. A memory which reflects the use of memory in the film, a memory encompassing a whole life of memories, from a young kid until his death.

It has such a real decency to it. It's realistic display of depicting a very kind gesture, sharing millions of lottery winnings money with a complete stranger, makes it simultaneously edgy while homely. It Could Happen to You is a soft-spoken hit film. There's not a lot of fuss to how good it is, it's just there, and it's just good. It's lead by its acting, with such good actors and actresses.

While it does lack a lot of what made the originals spectacular films, this is the one prequel that does not leave me annoyed after viewing it.Yes, The Phantom Menace does have some of the most hated things in the Star Wars franchise like Jar Jar Binks, midi-chlorians, and a plot that is based around the taxation of trade routes. However, of all of the prequels, it has the best story, best acting, and least amount of awful dialog.Awful dialog is still present in this film but it only comes from child actor Jake Lloyd (I am not saying he is a bad actor now). The acting is not great, especially with Natalie Portman's Queen Amidala, however, I feel this is her best acting of the entire prequel trilogy as it does not come off as annoying and whiny.This film at least manages to have a story that can be followed and is not just shot after shot of CGI crammed in everywhere. The CGI in this film is much more subtle.My main problem is that I do not get the motivations of the bad guys and a lot of the reasons there is a plot is unexplained. We don't know anything about the taxes nor why Naboo was picked as the targeted planet.This film is not great but it has a few fun moments like with the podrace and there is an epic lightsaber duel at the end which is the best out of all three prequels, proving that it is the best out of the prequels.

This is basically 1984 but much less boring and with jokes.I'll cut to the chase - Brazil is a masterpiece, reasons for this are about to be pointed out. But just if your wondering the only reason this is called Brazil is because of the song (by Geoff Muldaur) which plays every now and again in random places. The acting in Brazil is very good all round, personally I class the cast as an ensemble but some may disagree. Jonathan Pryce is the main character Sam Lowry who I have always thought is a lot like Arthur Dent from The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy. Robert De Niro is the rebel against society Harry Tuttle and is the most likable character in the movie. Bob Hoskins and Derrick O'Connor are 2 comedic ventilation repair men who come to a very amusing sticky end. Michael Palin (also a member of Monty Python) is Sam's old friend in a surprisingly serious, but very well performed, role. Ian Holm (was he never young) is Sam's boss and friend, Jim Broadbent a creep plastic surgeon nicknamed the acid man. And finally Kim Greist as Sam's one true love and alleged terrorist. All of these roles are brilliant, funny, well acted and memorable.Brazil possibly has the best plot and story of any movie I have ever seen, even if most of the source material is taken from (the extremely depressing) George Orwell's 1984. Everything is unexpected and definitely not predictable, even the love scenes are unique. terry Gilliam (the director) is of course in the hilarious Monty Python team, who are in my opinion the funniest comedy group ever, so you would expect Brazil to be extremely funny. Unfortunately it's not EXTREMELY funny, I laughed on many occasions but not as much as I would have liked to. But then again how can a movie based on 1984 be that hilarious? Finally the ending - in my opinion Brazil has the best and most effective ending of any movie ever. This is a spoiler free review so I won't reveal what happens, but I will say that it's a surprise and certainly not expected.Overall I will give Brazil 9.0\/10 and 4.5 stars, because the humour is not as strong as I expected it to be.

Although the film cost about $14,000,000 to make, it earned back almost $250,000,000...in the US alone! And, the soundtrack from the film was almost as big--with many of the songs getting enormous airtime. In fact, the soundtrack was a HUGE hit as well. And, not surprisingly, Eddie Murphy soon decided to call it quits on Saturday Night Live. On top of that, everyone seemed to be talking about the film...I can clearly remember that. Oddly, however, I didn't get around to seeing the film until now! And, now that I've seen it, I enjoyed it but also feel that the film sure would have played better back in the day than it does today.In this dramatic-comedy, Murphy plays Axel Foley--a freewheeling cop who seems to be the only one in the film who has a brain. He's smart and capable--and naturally the Detroit Police don't understand or appreciate him. One night, an old friend of Foley's shows up and after an evening partying, some assassins are waiting for them--killing the friend and sparing Foley. Clearly, Foley was not their target. Now, with the BAREST OF EVIDENCE, Foley is going on vacation to Beverly Hills to finish the investigation unofficially. However, once there, he finds the Beverly Hills Cops equally unappreciative of his talents and hassle him throughout most of the film. When the trail leads to a scum-bag named Maitland, the cops must decide whether to keep hassling Foley or jump into the fray with this out of control cop.The plot itself wasn't all that interesting to me and seemed a bit more like a plot from a TV cop show. However, this is not why folks liked the film. What folks liked, and I appreciated, was Murphy's humor--which was very much appreciated in order to liven up the mediocre plot. Is all this nonsense great? Nah...but it is quite good and Murphy's charisma was a MAJOR plus. Too bad this incredibly talented guy who made this and Dreamgirls (for which he received an Oscar nomination) also ended up making Norbit and The Adventures of Pluto Nash. Worth seeing, though you should be aware of the very crude language, violence and brief nudity.By the way, and it's not a complaint, but HOW DID AXEL GET THAT GUN IN THE BACK OF HIS PANTS AT THE END OF THE FILM?! He was shot in his right shoulder (his shooting arm) and yet the gun is stuffed in the back of his pants---in a way that could only happen if he did it with his damaged arm.

Bill Murray plays a person named Phil Connors who seems to be an arrogant self-centered individual who does not want to utilize his profession to cover this event. He works alongside his news producer named Rita who is played by actress Andie MacDowell. Phil Connors also has a cameraman for the news station named Larry who is played by Chris Elliott. Phil Connors shows up at the Groundhog Day event to do the coverage of this event even though he is not wanting to. Phil Connors plays a meteorologist in this film and he does not predict the weather right on this day. A big snowstorm hits the small town in Pennsylvania where he is covering the Groundhog Day events. When this occurs Phil keeps reliving the same day over and over again.Phil tries numerous things to get out of the time loop and one of these things is committing suicide just about every day. Once he realizes he cannot get out he decides to take advantage of this situation in a negative manner. He begins breaking the law by driving intoxicated, stealing money from people and taking advantage of women. He then realizes he has feelings for his news producer Rita which then turns everything around. Phil then develops what I would say is a hero's complex and begins doing well. By the end of the film he is a changed man and has a different view on his life as well as life with others. The theme of the movie Groundhog Day in my opinion is that one person's unhappiness whether with life or their job can be changed only if they choose for things to change.Another film that comes to mind that has a similar theme would be the movie Click where Adam Sandler has a remote and he can fast forward, pause, stop, play and rewind his life to get things right. This is similar to what Phil Connors was doing in the movie Groundhog Day. The lighting in this movie was amazing especially for the year it was produced and released. The lighting showed different aspects and placed emotion on different scenes throughout the movie. Overall, it was a great use of lighting. The angle the movie took as well was brilliant as this helped draw a crowd. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what Phil was going to do that same day he was reliving and such. No matter what we are faced with in life with our job or personal life if we need to get things in order and make a change we are the only ones responsible for doing so.

The theme of the movie Groundhog Day in my opinion is that one person's unhappiness whether with life or their job can be changed only if they choose for things to change.Another film that comes to mind that has a similar theme would be the movie Click where Adam Sandler has a remote and he can fast forward, pause, stop, play and rewind his life to get things right. This is similar to what Phil Connors was doing in the movie Groundhog Day. The lighting in this movie was amazing especially for the year it was produced and released. The lighting showed different aspects and placed emotion on different scenes throughout the movie. Overall, it was a great use of lighting. The angle the movie took as well was brilliant as this helped draw a crowd. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what Phil was going to do that same day he was reliving and such. No matter what we are faced with in life with our job or personal life if we need to get things in order and make a change we are the only ones responsible for doing so.

He tells it is a monster! The animal exactly looks like alien. He takes care of the monster, and helps it to come back to the home. Then, the monster is called E.T.! I can remember that E.T. is very famous in Japan several years ago. However, this is the first time I watch this movie. This is very educational story.

For the more, the monster is also has the kind and pure heart. When it behaves something, the children around the monster worry it very much. Because the monster is kept an eye by children, it feels like safe. To compare at the first time the monster is met the people with after pass the time, E.T. undergo a sea change.

I mean just look at him. Just the simple way he moves and stares at the others and his sudden rage attacks. Damn what a performance.The film itself is really enjoyable\/entertaining. This film crosses many lines, with its realistic, harsh tone. It sucks you right into its atmosphere, which can be really depressing in some parts as it does its job so well. And thats good for a film like that. the only bad thing about ROMPER STOMPER is the kind of boring second half. Surely its not a bad second half, it just feels so empty, but well nothing is perfect.I wouldn't recommend this film for educational reasons. If you are a teacher and you wanna teach your students about racism you better stick with American History X as the moral seams to be a little bit more focused on the subject.But anyways, check it out.

The entire film is just one two and a half hour toy commercial. It's possibly the worst film of all time with over the top action sequences, ridiculous costumes and make-up, effect that were obviously drawn on paper, just plain terrible acting, everyone wanting to punch robin in the face 700 times, and most of all, 65% of the entire movie is just plain one-liners. There is just plain nothing I love about about this movie. It makes every other bad movie look like a masterpiece. Don't even waste your time like I did. If you want to live a happy life on earth. This movie not only killed the Batman franchise for 8 years, but it also killed superhero movies for 4 years. George Clooney is the worst batman ever!!!!!!! Joel Schumaucher, if you are looking at this review you killed one of my favorite superheros. At least, thank the Lord God Almighty that he created Christopher Nolan. Why did Warner Bros. release this garbage. Don't see it at all!!!!!!!!!
