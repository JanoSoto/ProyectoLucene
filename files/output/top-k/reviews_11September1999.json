Kevin Costner is Billy Chapel, pitcher for the Detroit Tigers. He finds out that he is moved up in the pitching rotation to pitch in the last game of the season, and then also learns that  the team has been sold, he is going to be traded, and his girl friend is breaking up with him. All in all not a good day. As he takes the mound to pitch, he begins flashing back to one day five years previous when he meets Jane Aubrey, played by Kelly Preston. So begins his relationship with her. It's a tentative thing at first but it grows over the period of flashbacks as Billy continues to throw a masterpiece of a game. He meets Jane's daughter Heather played by the very good Jena Malone.(The only problem I really had with this movie is that she wasn't given a whole lot to do, and she has the ability.) Billy isn't put off by Heather as Jane expects he might, and the three begin to grow close as they spend more time together. John C. Reilly(from Boogie Nights) continues his winning streak of great character parts as Gus, the Tiger's catcher. The manager of the team played by JK Simmons wants another catcher to be behind the plate at the beginning of the movie, but Chapel refuses to throw to anyone but Gus. His career is ending and he has a decision to make about when exactly it will end, the way he lets the owner know is very appropriate. Meanwhile, the perfect game is going on and Jane is watching from the airport where she purposely misses the flight to London where she is to begin a new job(she's a writer) to see the end of the game, and Heather is in her dorm at USC also watching the game. I got the feeling that while she may have been just friends with Chapel, she would have liked it just as much as if he had been her father.  The ending of the movie was satisfying and Costner is now 3-3 in his baseball movies. It isn't often that they do sequels to sports movies, but this is a movie I'd like to know what happens to the characters involved after the credits roll.

Excellent camera work. The story is perfectly acted out. You could actually feel the characters pains and fears. I loved it not only for the above, but because, finally, the ending went against the old fashioned 'and they lived happily ever after'. I've seen a lot of movies and these days, you can pretty much deduce what happens next. But not with sixth sense. It's a solid 9 out of 10 in my book.

I rent it as much as i can. I love all the characters, wonderful effects and great acting...    We'll start with Burt and Vicki played by the great Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton. I like Horton's courage and Hamilton's strength. My favorite characters were the cute Job and Sarah, though Job was annoying at sometimes i thought they were wonderful. Then there was Rachel, it assume she was in charge of the ceremonies, she was real creepy. Then there was the leader Isaac, his facial expressions and raspy voice fit the character of Isaac Chroner perfect. Then there was Malachi, it seemed like he was in charge, but he obeyed Isaac's word even though he was clearly two feet taller than him.    I give Children of the Corn 9.5\/10 stars on the Jeff Scale. Thank you for calling!

And I think the critics who bad mouthed this movie were ticked that the Rocky plotlines weren't what is called A Work Of Art such as Rocky 1 and 2. The plot lines in the Rocky movies shifted in Rocky 3, and got to be more interesting, because he wasn't some guy living in a slum boxing with an old man after part 2, which the critics thought was Arthouse GreatnessAnyways, this movie has a great conflict in it. The at the time, U.S.S.R. was trying to make it's way into sports, by enginnering Dolph Lundgren with steroids and high-tech exercize equipment, which I thought was pretty interesting. And Rocky, as usual, trains the old school way, by old fashoned boxing and strength gaining methods. The movie I think was made to teach a point at that time. If you notice when Drago begins to lose the match, and notice he isn't as strong as what he thought, he gains some respect for Rocky. The ending is a little impossible, and wierd, yes. But I think this is a must see if you are into Rocky Movies. Stay away from number 5 though.

I found Kevin Bacon's performance excellent, and Kathryn Erbe's character to be genuine and completely real life. By the way, it was so nice to see Kathryn in a well-made movie with a good script. She is such a wonderful actress when the movie and script are equal to her talent. One small criticism I do have is that I found the movie to take a little too long to develop. But, once it did the film just flowed wonderfully well. I gave this film a solid and well deserved 8 on a scale of 1-10.
