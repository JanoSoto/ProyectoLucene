[{"date":"3 August 2008","score":"","review":" 'Shrek' is a great movie. I know we're all sick of the franchise now. Seriously, who didn't groan when Dreamworks announced 'Shrek Goes Forth'? But the reason the franchise is now being done to death, indeed, the reason that 'Shrek' became a franchise in the first place, is because the first film absolutely rocked.Where to begin? Well, 'Shrek' is first and foremost a comedy. The main comic relief character is Donkey, and Eddie Murphy does a marvellous job voicing him. Donkey is a talking donkey who never shuts up, and makes the perfect foil for the humourless ogre Shrek (voice of Mike Myers). The film follows Shrek and Donkey as they go to rescue Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz) as part of a deal they struck with the evil, conniving midget, Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow).There is humour of all kinds. Given that the title character is a big, smelly ogre, there are inevitably a few bodily function gags. There is no shortage of fairy tale satire, putting some clichés in their place while revelling in others. Fiona beats the hell out of an outrageously camp Robin Hood and detonates Mrs. Bluebird. Donkey has the odd blue line and there are some delightfully un-PC height jokes aimed at Lord Farquaad. I laughed so hard that I literally cried, and that doesn't happen often.But despite being a comedy, 'Shrek' still makes time for some lovely quiet moments of pure character development. The characters, too, are thoroughly likable, which makes the sad montage near the end a lot easier to swallow.Now, upon its release in 2001, Shrek was a technical marvel. Never before had we seen such sophisticated facial animation, and Donkey's fur completely blew the scale. For the first time we had a CG film set in an organic world as we might see it, and 'Shrek' pulled it off remarkably well. However, computers have since advanced and by today's standards the whole thing looks rubbery and stiff. But 'Shrek' really was a technical revolution at the time, and that deserves kudos.So, is there anything wrong with 'Shrek'? Well, there is one bit where Fiona gets angry and shouts at Shrek, and Shrek (who is like four times her size) finds her intimidating. Umm... right. I'm aware that it was supposed to be surprising, showing an unexpectedly fierce side to Fiona, but I just couldn't buy it. I imagine a more realistic reaction from Shrek would have been laughter, because the fact is that Fiona wasn't fierce or scary at all, especially after her display of impotent rage just minutes before. There is also a really sappy bit right near the end, where even Donkey's interjections couldn't cut the treacle. Chicks seem to dig it, though.Ultimately, however, these imperfect spots in an otherwise brilliant film don't matter.Overall, 'Shrek' is laugh-out-loud funny, well thought out, well presented and very well acted, and should leave you on cloud nine. Eight at least. Seven if you are Oscar the Grouch. ","genre":null},{"date":"3 August 2008","score":"","review":" 'Shrek' is a great movie. I know we're all sick of the franchise now.
