Everyone says it sucks but i'm in the year 2012 and think its awesome. SPOILER-ISH part.- As Andrew slowly becomes human you start to kinda root for him in a way. -SPOILER-ISH over I think the plot was pretty good in reality. There is some humor not allot but that is not a let down. Robin Williams did great in this movie. This like i said is one of the greatest Robot Movies if not any movie I have ever seen. Many moments you kinda want to cry but they then cheer you up with a heart warming moment. If you go to a Redbox or something and see this I would greatly suggest this movie.
