It even has its photography based on the work of Richard Avedon, and Astaire's character is based on him in his fashion work. I enjoyed it, but it depends too much on common formulas, which I normally don't mind, and it lacks cohesion, flow, and what you might just call magic.That it's partly shot in New York and then Paris (a famously rainy Paris during the shoot) you would think you could hardly go wrong. And in a way it doesn't go wrong overall. But the plot lacks energy, the romantic chemistry is missing (the two are really more like father and daughter), and the series of dance numbers is choppy and uneven. Because of all this, each song goes on too long and you itch for the next scene, and then that scene merely takes us back to the weak plot.If you focus on these weaknesses the movie starts to look almost terrible. Hepburn's transformation from a tweedy intellectual in a bookshop in Manhattan to the premiere runway in Paris sounds like dream come true stuff, but it isn't really convincing (or surprising, of course). The French counter-culture intellectual scene is fun idea but it doesn't push it very far, and the leading voice is played by an actor with no presence at all. Hepburn's interactions in this whole world are forced. Even the opening twenty minutes, which sets the tone, is rough sledding before out two leading actors appear.But focus on the strengths and there are some great moments. Like the series of photo shoots, one after another quickly spreading across the highlights of the city, is fun and stylish. A few of the dance numbers, though short of classic, are great fun, like the modern one in the French smokey bar and the one in the darkroom with the safelights on. In both of these, again, director Stanley Donen (a consummate pro at this stuff) let things drag on just a minute too long, which is a long time in a fast moving movie like this.Then there is Fred Astaire, at ease and warm and really wonderful. He doesn't get a chance to quite blow the doors off any of the dances, but he's still a joy to watch, dancing or just being his warm self. (He was initially a reluctant actor at this point in his life, but was still very active. For a sense of his truer self, perhaps, behind the scenes, see On the Beach two years later.)Then there is Audrey Hepburn, by now a stellar and unique star trying to spread her wings into musicals (this was her first). She, as usual in her career, rose above her part and like Astaire was herself with such charm she keeps even weaker scenes going. When she's in them, which luckily she is in most of them by the second half. Hepburn also comes across as a superb model (appropriately thin, but not especially tall), and Avedon's photographs of her taken in conjunction with filming are iconic. They get incorporated into the movie directly, both in the scenes where Astaire creates some photos in his role, and in some of the cinematography which imitates Avedon's style (white backdrops, modern styling). In the end it's a great seeming movie with such huge flaws it's just another musical. But that's not fair, quite, so think of it as an up and down ride with some very very fine high points which make it worth watching.

It is a psychological thriller that will require your full attention. This includes the opening credits which provide critical background information. In the opening credits, you see old newspaper clippings from 1949 about the shocking death of pianist Margaret Strauss (Emma Thompson). Based on the clippings, we learn that Margaret's husband, conductor-composer Robert Strauss (Kenneth Branagh) claims a thief killed Margaret but he is later arrested for the crime after his fingerprints are found on a pair of scissors. Testimony from witnesses as well as his refusal to testify results in a guilty verdict and Strauss gets the death penalty. Most of the newspaper articles were written by Gray Baker (Andy Garcia) who visits Strauss at his request on the day of his execution. Strauss asks Baker to print that He loved his wife and that he will love her forever while getting his hair sheard with scissors by one of the guards. Baker asks Strauss why he is not afraid of death and Strauss states that he is not because things are far from over. When Baker states, But you still killed her, didn't you?, Strauss gets up and whispers something in his ear. Strauss is then escorted down the hallway to the death chamber. As Baker gets up to leave, he looks at the newspaper that was next to Strauss and notices the scissors that the guard had laid down are missing. We then see the scissors in Strauss's hand as Baker runs down the hallway yelling stop to Strauss. At the end of the hallway is a vision of Margaret Strauss and then we see Robert Strauss reach out and begin to stab her. We're instantly snapped forward into color (from black and white) and a modern day Emma Thompson awakes from her nightmare where she appears to live on the same property as where the Strauss' used to live. Now all of this happens during the first five minutes of the movie and if you're not hooked, then something's really wrong!

Suspicions abound as we piece together details from past lives and how they relate to the current characters. In doing so, we are left on the edge of our seats as new facts and twists are revealed.This is a thinking person's movie with a load of originality.

So...by now, the careers of Ryder, Jolie, Duvall, Moss, and the late Murphy have all processed through the Hollywood machine, and the only ones left standing are Jolie, Duvall, and Moss. So this time when I watched this film, I saw something different in Ryder and Jolie. And what I saw was that they had been perfectly cast as themselves. Ryder looked overworked, underweight, and tired. Jolie appeared flippant about serious underlying rage, and slipped in and out of extreme emotions as she tore a path of destruction behind her with all those she vented onto.Somehow, this didn't seem to be a stretch for either of the actors because based on what I've read about Ryder, she was suffering from extreme fatigue and exhaustion; and Jolie spent several years in the tabloids proving how an angry teenager turns into a crazy young adult who likes to do shocking things for attention. Wow. And she received awards for this. Nonetheless, the cast was very good, and the general tone of the movie was captivating and realistic while maintaining its value as ENTERTAINMENT, for all those reviewers who believe art should imitate the true grit of life. No, please. That's why we like films. Because they give us something to look forward to next time; because they allow the viewer to escape for awhile. It's very difficult to put all the details of one person's descent into mental illness into a one-and-a-half-hour of time, as anyone knows who watched A Beautiful Mind. So good job to the screenwriter and the director. This film is cleverly written, acted, directed, and produced because it slowly, imperceptibly, and progressively makes the mental institution appear safer than the world outside; which is illustrated toward the end of the film when the kind nurse played by Whoopi Goldberg tells Ryder's character not to drop anchor there. And while some reviewers have remarked that Ryder's character seemed self-indulgent, spoiled, and simply struggling with non-conformity, Ryder's character articulated the grim reality of her own mental illness when she painfully admitted to Jared Leto's character that she tried to kill herself by taking a bottle of aspirin; which was a complete departure from the character's denial when she was first admitted to the institution. When confronted with the opportunity to be free, Susanna was also confronted with a choice to be honest or stay stuck in denial. My favorite scene was the scene where Susanna and her parents were having a conference with the doctor played by Jeffrey Tambor, and Susanna's mother couldn't stop crying, while Susanna's father was loudly demanding to know how long his daughter would be in this place? Then Susanna asked if her disease was genetic, and both parents halted their self-absorbed behaviors for 1 second to hear the answer before resuming their own brand of insanity. This scene told the viewer everything they needed to know about why Susanna felt depressed. Who would have anything to look forward to at 18 years of age when they had already realized how pretentious the adult world is? And what a kid has to become in order to fit in? Oh yes, these girls were trying to tell us something, and here it is children like to pretend, and as children grow up they're told by adults to stop pretending and face reality. So whose reality are they supposed to be facing, when they see that all the adults they should be able to trust are pretending? or plain lying?

So...by now, the careers of Ryder, Jolie, Duvall, Moss, and the late Murphy have all processed through the Hollywood machine, and the only ones left standing are Jolie, Duvall, and Moss. So this time when I watched this film, I saw something different in Ryder and Jolie. And what I saw was that they had been perfectly cast as themselves. Ryder looked overworked, underweight, and tired. Jolie appeared flippant about serious underlying rage, and slipped in and out of extreme emotions as she tore a path of destruction behind her with all those she vented onto.Somehow, this didn't seem to be a stretch for either of the actors because based on what I've read about Ryder, she was suffering from extreme fatigue and exhaustion; and Jolie spent several years in the tabloids proving how an angry teenager turns into a crazy young adult who likes to do shocking things for attention. Wow. And she received awards for this. Nonetheless, the cast was very good, and the general tone of the movie was captivating and realistic while maintaining its value as ENTERTAINMENT, for all those reviewers who believe art should imitate the true grit of life. No, please. That's why we like films. Because they give us something to look forward to next time; because they allow the viewer to escape for awhile. It's very difficult to put all the details of one person's descent into mental illness into a one-and-a-half-hour of time, as anyone knows who watched A Beautiful Mind. So good job to the screenwriter and the director. This film is cleverly written, acted, directed, and produced because it slowly, imperceptibly, and progressively makes the mental institution appear safer than the world outside; which is illustrated toward the end of the film when the kind nurse played by Whoopi Goldberg tells Ryder's character not to drop anchor there. And while some reviewers have remarked that Ryder's character seemed self-indulgent, spoiled, and simply struggling with non-conformity, Ryder's character articulated the grim reality of her own mental illness when she painfully admitted to Jared Leto's character that she tried to kill herself by taking a bottle of aspirin; which was a complete departure from the character's denial when she was first admitted to the institution. When confronted with the opportunity to be free, Susanna was also confronted with a choice to be honest or stay stuck in denial. My favorite scene was the scene where Susanna and her parents were having a conference with the doctor played by Jeffrey Tambor, and Susanna's mother couldn't stop crying, while Susanna's father was loudly demanding to know how long his daughter would be in this place? Then Susanna asked if her disease was genetic, and both parents halted their self-absorbed behaviors for 1 second to hear the answer before resuming their own brand of insanity. This scene told the viewer everything they needed to know about why Susanna felt depressed. Who would have anything to look forward to at 18 years of age when they had already realized how pretentious the adult world is? And what a kid has to become in order to fit in? Oh yes, these girls were trying to tell us something, and here it is children like to pretend, and as children grow up they're told by adults to stop pretending and face reality. So whose reality are they supposed to be facing, when they see that all the adults they should be able to trust are pretending? or plain lying?

Amongst the greats of Halloween and The Thing, The Fog is often a little forgotten but it's a terrific piece of work. It starts out very much in the atmosphere created by the opening scene, an old sailor's ghost story told around the fire to chill the blood (anyone else think the Captain's role was written for Donald Pleasance?)

As with The Thing these aren't a bunch of unlikeable teenagers waiting to get chopped up, these are some very capable people gradually putting together the clues pointing to an extraordinary conclusion and dealing with it admirably (in fact like Halloween very few deaths and little explicit gore). If I was to have a favourite scene it would be Stevie Way's heroic last stand atop her lighthouse, staying at her post to warn the townspeople of the impending danger (remember she has no idea that her son has been rescued). Great dialogue and music as you would expect from John Carpenter, a wonderful atmosphere created by the fog even though it's the hokiest of movie special effects dating right back to silent era.

Maybe you'd sneak into the top ten. But there's just no room for you in the top five, sorry! Those places are reserved for the kind of humiliation and heartbreak you're just not capable of delivering. Rob then proceeds to give a recap of his various misadventures in love, starting with his first breakup in grade school. He also talks extensively about the highs and lows of his relationship with Laura. Of course, we find out that Laura's departure has gotten to Rob a lot more than he initially admits. Rob talks to the camera throughout this movie, much in the same way he might talk to his therapist about his life, his loves, his friends and his hopes and dreams.In between flashbacks, we meet some of the quirky people in Rob's life, most notably Barry and Dick (played by Jack Black and Todd Louiso), the two cultural rejects who work for him at the record store. Along with Rob, they like to fancy themselves as pop music aficionados and look down on the musically undiscriminating masses (Barry is especially annoying in this regard, even refusing to sell a record to a potential customer and treating him like garbage simply because, he offended me with his terrible taste!).Cusack is great at playing characters who are borderline insane, and this movie is definitely no exception.

Then there's the scene where Rob fantasizes about pounding the stuffing out of the condescending and pretentious Ray (aka Ian), the other guy Laura's been seeing (played by Tim Robbins).High Fidelity is a terrific story about life and love with intelligent, clever, thoughtful dialog and memorable, quirky characters that draw you right in.

Anyone who wants to go to war after seeing the opening scene of this film is crazy. This film is poignant and heartbreaking, particularly Vin Diesel and Private Mellish's deaths, and the idea that this film is pro-war in any way is ridiculous. A bunch of reviewers on here criticize the film for only showing the American perspective on D-Day hate to break it to you guys, but this is a film about a squad of American soldiers who go on a mission to find an American paratrooper whose brothers have been killed in combat. Putting another country's perspective in this film would have been ridiculous and wouldn't have fit in with the rest of the film. As for the other arguments against the film, which are basically a bunch of nit picky details like the type of rifle they are carrying or an insignia on someone's uniform or some other ridiculous historical detail that really has no effect on the film at all, this movie never pretends to be a documentary, and shouldn't be taken as one. Some of these people cite The Paths of Glory or The Longest Day as examples of great war films, and don't get me wrong, I loved both movies, but I could write a whole list on their historical inaccuracies. Films like this one should not be analyzed as documentaries, but should be taken for what they are-excellent, well-filmed, well-acted, harrowing, and heartbreaking films that bring the brutality and horror of war into our lives.

The only reason I say funny is because of the overall idea of a giant ape terrorizing but also falling in love with a woman, the overall plot is rather comical. One thing that I found interesting and funny was that the monsters in the movie were projected on a screen in the background while the actors were running and walking in front of it; I guess that's what you get for special effects during that time but the film didn't look bad and it wasn't really distracting, I just happened to notice. It became obvious during the scene where the ship crew encountered the first dinosaur on their quest to save Ann and they were moving around the dead dinosaur laying on the ground, you can tell that the dinosaur is projected onto a screen and the actors are moving in front of it. But because of this it limits the camera angles to only be shooting in front of the screen to capture the monster and the actors, the camera is not able to really move with the actors as if the monster were chasing them from behind and the camera was shooting in front of them or from the side and moving with them. Maybe unless the actors ran in place or on a treadmill and the camera shot directly in front of them then maybe a good chase scene could be captured, but all in all it would probably be difficult no matter what. It looked the best during the scene where the director and the crew brought the monster to the city to show him off and he escaped from his shackles. When he did escape you could barely tell that the monster was projected onto a screen, it was mostly during the jungle settings where you could tell. Besides that I have no other comments about this movie, the actors were great and the lighting was good because you can easily see everything even in the jungle during night time. I thought it was a good classic monster movie and worth watching.

In that regard it succeeds admirably, there's nothing remotely titillating here, indeed the only real nudity is Frank Langella's rather startling full frontal scene as he flees a gun-toting Humbert in the finale. From start to finish despite the beauty of the photography and Humbert's elegiac narration it's plain to all that this is a tragedy, Humbert's final words are those of regret that through his selfishness he has denied Lolita her childhood (and through the ultimate revelation it seems the joy of motherhood too).Plenty of good here, Irons is great as Humbert (to think this is the guy I watched as a child on kids variety show 'Playaway'!), handsome enough for the role but not some blatant Casanova, you can understand why he appeals to women without casting him as an incorrigible womanizer or pervert. He achieves the near impossible task of creating audience sympathy for a man who attempts to drug rape an adolescent virgin (or so he thinks). Melanie Griffith does well with the frankly thankless task of playing Lolita's mother and Swain is fine as the title character, a shame she never seemed to be able to capitalize upon the brief fame it brought her. Langella almost steals the entire show as the odious Quilty (the dark reflection of Humbert himself, murdering him as an act of self-loathing?).If there's one flaw it's that ultimately it falls short of confronting the monstrosity of Humbert's actions. Dominique Swain's Lolita is always clearly a teenage girl on the verge of womanhood, she's very obviously 14. In the book Lolita is only 12, the film chickens out from casting a girl who looks the correct age as it would just be too uncomfortable for the audience and legally difficult to cast an actress who'd look the right age but have to take part in (both literally and figuratively) 'adult' scenes. Casting her as older puts everything in an altogether different light (Humbert and Lolita's relationship would actually be legal in parts of Europe and the US at the time) and lessens the impact of the taboo being broken, with every year older she becomes the subject matter is conversely less shocking. In the end the film doesn't have the courage of its' convictions. Still I think that ultimately it is the best adaptation we shall ever have of this most controversial of literary classics.

Going back and watching this film after so many years had a lot of things going through my mind. Such as the first time I watched this it was in the theater as the second part of a double feature with DEAD MAN WALKING. Talk about a depressing four hours in the theater. The second thing it reminded me of was what a terrific actor Cage was and how at the time many people were calling him one of the greatest of his generation. I bring this up considering the type of films Cage is currently doing. LEAVING LAS VEGAS is without question a very dark and depressing film and it always amuses me that people attacked the picture for this. I mean, there are several films each year that shows the fun side of drinking so I always find it strange that so many could object to a film showing the ugly side. I can understand people not wanting to sit through a nearly two-hour suicide movie but at the same time those who can stomach the story are going to be shown one of the best performances from this era. Cage is simply marvelous as the alcoholic who goes on a death wish for reasons we're not fully told. It's funny but the screenplay really doesn't give us much insight to either character other than both are troubled, alone and find some sort of comfort with each other. This love story between the two certainly isn't all that casual or romantic but it's quite unique in its own way. The way Cage controls this character, his various emotions and the physical nature of his body falling apart are simply amazing to watch. It really reminds one of how great he can be when the material is right. Shue also turns in the best performance of her career and you can really see the pain in her eyes as this man she loves is slowly dying. Julian Sands is also quite effective in his few scenes. Director Mike Figgis does an extremely good job with the material but a lot of credit also needs to go towards his film score.

Many years later bloody fighting with the settlers in the American frontier and a bitter battle between the Apaches and the US cavalry in the struggle for the West , the chief Apache Gerónimo is obliged to undertake a humiliating defeat . But his warrior more radical and violent named Maasai (Burt Lancaster), renounces to accept rendition . Maasai refuses to surrender and takes on the relentless American cavalry (John McIntire , Charles Bronson) , attempting to get a step ahead of the perfectly trained troopers ,all of them have vowed to kill him . Meanwhile , he falls in love for a gorgeous Apache woman (Jean Peters) . And as his crusade will precipitate toward an epic final battle . Maasai to be realized that he must persevere , not only for his life , but also by the pride of all his Apache race . There really was a renegade Apache warrior called Massai, who was a bloodthirsty killer renowned for stealing, raping and murdering. He did indeed escape from a prison train bound for Florida and made his way back to his homeland.This thoughtful picture is an excellent adaptation based on the novel by Paul J. Wellman titled ¨Bronco Apache¨ . This film is , along with Devil'S Doorway and  Broken Arrow, one of the few titles of great quality shot in the 1950s to praise the figure of the Red Skins against White Men . Interestingly , the screenwriter James R Webb and the director Robert Aldrich found the character Maasai of the original novel very aggressive , so they decided to join an Apache woman well performed by the wonderful Jean Peters who married Howard Hughes . Lancaster makes an unforgettable and top-notch interpretation as a two-fisted warrior named Maasai , transmitting all the fierceness , nobility and ubiquity of his particularly stubborn role as well as unfriendly . A top-drawer western , the third feature film of the great Aldrich , here directing a Western masterpiece and to confirm with another great movie  Vera Cruz . Apache is a thrilling and vibrant story to deal with the figure of a rebel Indian ; the own Aldrich did in 1972 another splendid film with this theme  Ulzana's raid also with Lancaster as starring . The good of the screenplay is presented to the American Indian with dignity , honour and understanding . This is an intelligent , top-of-the-range piece for its time that had the original tragic final re-shot, against Aldrich's wishes , to make it more happy . He later concluded that if you shoot two endings, they will always use the other one, never yours. In ¨Apache¨ Robert Aldrich gave a tense and brilliant direction , though was shot in 30 days . Aldrich began writing and directing for TV series in the early 1950s, and directed his first feature in 1953 (Big Leaguer ,1953). Soon thereafter he established his own production company and produced most of his own films, collaborating in the writing of many of them . Directed in a considerable plethora of genres but almost all of his films contained a subversive undertone . He was an expert on warlike (Dirty Dozen , The Angry Hills , Attack , Ten seconds to hell) and Western (The Frisko kid , Ulzana's raid, Apache , Veracruz , The last sunset) . ¨Apache¨ is a masterful film in all aspects , is among the best westerns of the cinema .

Enlisting other unemployed desperadoes like his former manager Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), ex-security guard Lomper (Steve Huison), smooth mover Horse (Paul Barber) and well-endowed hunk Guy (Hugo Speer), the unlikely lotharios set about practising their dance moves and perfecting a raunchy routine. The stakes are upped considerably when some women spot the lads putting up posters to advertise their show. When the women laugh off their ambitious scheme, Gaz decides to up the ante by telling them they will be going the Full Monty (fully naked). Nobody said anything to me about the Full Monty! gasps Horse, but his protests come too late&#x85; the word is already out and the guys have a 400-strong audience of baying women to satisfy.In truth, The Full Monty could quite easily have turned up as a feature length TV-style drama - at first glance it certainly isn't an especially cinematic sort of film (e.g. a film that belongs on the big screen). Thanks to Simon Beaufoy's cracking script and the game performances, it transcends its small roots to become a thoroughly enjoyable story indeed. Performances that stand out include Carlyle as the desperate Gaz, Addy as the terribly self-conscious and overweight Dave, and Wilkinson as their once-proud manager, now reduced to teaching a bunch of 'commoners' to dance (as well as joining them in their potentially humiliating enterprise). Most of the performances are strong right down the cast list, but these three are a notch ahead of the rest. The dialogue is often very funny and the grim locations add to the film's sense of social deprivation and desperation. Like most comedies, repeat viewings gradually diminish the film's humour and freshness&#x85; but first time round it is a vastly entertaining film, successfully managing to generate a feel-good atmosphere within its grimmest of settings. Director Peter Cattaneo never really pushed on after The Full Monty &#x96; to date he has only made three other features (none of which match the giddy heights of this one). It's a shame that he hasn't been able to capitalise on such a phenomenally successful debut.As Yorkshire-based cinema goes, The Full Monty is the most successful film ever to have come out of the region. It's also one of the best. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music"}]
