[{"date":"31 March 2004","score":"","review":"  Election had to be one of the more overlooked films of the past few years. This film is not really a comedy in the traditional sense but rather a satire on elections and personalities. Reese Witherspoon gives one of her best performance as Tracy Flick the overachiever. All the cast is perfectly cast. Throughout the film the director uses subtle irony and symbolism in the background. This film makes think at the same time it makes you laugh. On DVD this film only includes director's commentary and nothing else extra. I was hoping for a little more in that aspect. Great rental or buy.Grade B+ ","genre":null},{"date":"31 March 2004","score":"","review":"  Election had to be one of the more overlooked films of the past few years.
