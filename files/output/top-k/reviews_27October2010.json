[{"date":"27 October 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is still having nightmares of Ben Willis (Muse Waston), an psychopath killer who murdered Julie's two friends. At times, Julie doesn't believe that Ben is dead. One morning, Julie and her best friend Karla (Brandy Norwood) actually won a contest for the Bahamas during the weekend with four plane tickets. Karla invites Julie, Karla's boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer) and their friend Will (Matthew Settle). At first, Julie is disappointed that her boyfriend Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.) couldn't come with them. Instead, Ray finds himself stalked by Ben and nearly killing Ray. Julie and her friends find out, they come in the storm season. There is barely any guests expect for some of the hotel's workers. Since Ben is actually in the Bahamas, killing the hotel's employees before getting to Julie and her friends. Now it is only Ray, who can stop Ben before it is too late.Directed by Danny Cannon (Judge Dredd, Pheonix) made an watchable if sometimes lousy and lazy sequel to the original, I Know What You Did Last Summer. Hewitt, Prinze Jr. and Waston are back in their roles from the first movie. At first, the movie starts out pretty dull and it takes too much of its take to get to the suspense and thrills. Although the sequel does have familiar faces like Jeffery Combs, Jennifer Esposito, Bill Cobbs, John Hawkes, Mark Boone Junior and an uncredited Jack Black. The movie finally gets better towards the third act and it has one good surprise during the suspenseful moments. The movie is actually entertaining enough for horror fans. But die-hard fans of the original might be disappointed. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is a mixed bag at best. Beware of Jennifer Love Hewitt's song in the movie titled How Do I Deal! Panavision.
