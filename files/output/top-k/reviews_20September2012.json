Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton, and as the 'Van' clearly indicates, he's a rich and influent man. He's also one of these miserable loners leaving not much to envy, celebrating his 48th with one hamburger, a cupcake with one candle, and watching CNN on a big sofa, in a vast mansion where he lives alone, divorced and totally passionless. Acting as cold-hearted tyrant with his employees and servants, he strikes as a man who trusts no one and needs to keep things under his control.Only Douglas can make the alienating effect of excessive respectability and a sense of desperate misery coexist within the same character. A living paradox, Nicholas Van Orton is like a combo of Gordon Gekko and D-Fens. Yet, the film alternates between scenes where he vents his anger on his entourage and childhood flashbacks. Nicholas' father committed suicide when he was 48 and it surely affected Nicholas for the rest of his life. How do we know? Well, the script wouldn't have bothered to show it right in the beginning otherwise. If it was revealed later in the middle of the life-changing process, we'd have known that Nicholas could change. But we have to know the wound in his heart from the beginning, to understand that not only he can change, but needs to change.His brother Conrad (Sean Penn) is a more optimistic and down-to-earth character his name-code to reach Nicholas is Seymour Butts and his gift to Conrad is no less original, a sort of game provided by CRS, a Consumer Recreation Services. The game is a life-changing experience combining fun and self-improvement, two things that cruelly lack in Nicholas' life. Visibly intrigued but not really enthusiastic, Nicholas promises to give a try. Coincidentally, he finds himself near the CRS' new headquarters and hears people talking about it. As one of the managers, played by the90's ultimate character-actor James Hebhorn says, it's the 'game that comes to you and we sure had a glimpse. Nicholas is invited to forget his suspicion, to admit he's intrigued (and that's a clever wink to the audience by the screenplay) and that he's got nothing to lose, except one or two hours of medical and psychological tests, that would last longer naturally.It's so enjoyable to watch a control freak like character like Van Orton, pushed in weird to uncontrollable situations, gradually building the suspense. As soon as the game starts, it's a long descent into one of the most nightmarish cinematic experiences, driven by the growing conviction that anything, a waiter, a taxi cab, a cop, a man sitting in front of you, is part of it. What would you expect when even a TV anchorman talks to you or when you're lured into drinking a poisoned coffee by a woman who was not supposed to be part of the game? The paranoid feeling is efficiently conveyed by Fincher's directing, by borrowing some aspects from Seven, it does show a more shadowy and menacing face of San Francisco, and the film owes a lot to the subtle yet powerful performance by Douglas that puts us directly in his shoes..Yet as promising as the idea of a game that puts a client on one deadly situation after another sounds, the film couldn't have handled it for a 2-hour runtime. Indeed, even if The Game expects a final twist, it has to mislead the viewer. After all, if a film is supposed to reveal that the bad guy is A, you have to suspect B and by personal deduction. The same goes with The Game and proves Fincher's special talent to handle twist endings. If we take into consideration that Van Orton is a wealthy man, and that the whole game is a scheme to steal his money, then everything makes perfect sense. The script hooks us to this certitude until the end, where we realize that it was indeed a game that went wrong &#x85; enough to turn out to be successful. Believing that he accidentally killed his brother, Nicholas jumps off a high building and land in the right spot, on an inflated lifesaving cushion. The game is over and all the protagonists are here for a last 'Gotcha!'.This part is hard to believe for movie purists, but what would they have expected anyway? If you admit that CRS was always one step ahead of Van Orton, and could have predicted his reactions from his tests, if not believable, it seems plausible. Besides, it makes a whole sense to the character's arc, he had to be lonely man who had no other choice than being the way he was after his father's death, , to experience the same act of despair and realize that there's much to life than drowning his past on sad memories, when he opens his eyes, he's given a second chance. It's simple, believable, but the script if not a masterpiece of sophistication, is well-constructed enough to deliver what we'd expect and Douglas' performance turned it into something even more emotionally challenging.The film started with a man celebrating his birthday alone, and ends up with the same man celebrating his rebirth with all the people that count in his life.

But it's not a slapstick or screwball comedy. It is in the class of It Happened One Night, My Man Godfry, and Holiday. The humor is in snappy dialog. The one-liners, subtle zingers, and satire poke fun mostly at Soviet Russia and communism. But it has occasional jabs at capitalism and western lifestyles &#x96; notably the idle rich. The movie is superb in all aspects, especially in the script, direction, settings and acting. All of the cast give top performances. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas are the perfect match for some of the funniest repartee ever put on film. But, how Garbo (Ninotchka) could keep a straight face in those exchanges, one after another, is beyond me. I'll bet MGM had to do many retakes of some of her scenes. If not for her breaking down, then for the cracking up of Douglas (Leon) or others on the set and behind the camera. Ninotchka is one of the great comedy-romances for the ages. Young and old alike can enjoy it. But, from some of the comments I've read, it seems much of the humor is lost without a little knowledge of the time. So, I offer these tidbits to help set the stage and prepare viewers for a most enjoyable film. The time is the late 1930s. The story takes place mostly in Paris, moves to Moscow later, and ends in Istanbul. In 1939, all the world knows about Soviet Russia and many of its problems. It has been in the news since the communist takeover after the revolutions 20 years earlier. Joseph Stalin's five-year plan for recovery since 1922 was past its 15th year. So far, it had been an abysmal failure. His social programs had disrupted total populations. His collectivist farm program had failed miserably. Combined with drought and famine, the Russian people faced starvation.But that's not all. The Great Purge of 1936-38 had been in the news the past couple of years. It was Stalin's way to get rid of anyone who didn't agree with him or who might challenge his oppressive rule of Russia. The purge eradicated half a million Russian leaders. The press had covered the carefully staged mock trials in Moscow in that time. Many Russian communist and social leaders confessed to being traitors before they were sentenced to death or the gulags in Siberia. As all of that was going on and being reported from Russia, a number of former Czarist Russian royalty were living in exile around Europe, especially in Paris. Many stories and jokes circulated at that time about crown jewels and lost titles. Thus, the stage is set for Ninotchka. With the large number of reviews posted up to this time, I wouldn't normally add my own. But, I think far too many people have missed the true depth of the satire and comedy in this great film. The IMDb Web site has a long list of witty dialog and exchanges from the film. But there are many more &#x96; and some real subtle zingers that I think many people miss. Here are a few to whet your appetite. In an early scene, Ninotchka explains why Soviet Russia is peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time. She says, Our next year's crop is in danger, and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors, there'll not be enough bread for our people and you comrades. What a great example of skewered Soviet thinking. As if tractors could overcome a drought and famine. It's a great jab at the Soviets.Here's another one. Garbo looks over her hotel suite and says, I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this. And another, when her cohorts take her to the suite they reserved for her. Which part of the room is mine? Garbo asks. And a cohort replies, You see, comrade, it's a little different here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite. One more side-splitter was when her agents asked, How are things in Moscow? Garbo replied, Very good. The last mass trial was a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians. A direct jab at Stalin's Great Purge. Douglas, meeting with the three agents early in the film, says that the jewels owned by the exiled duchess were confiscated by the Soviets. One of the agents quips, I give you my word, they were confiscated legally. In a café later, a waiter seats Ninotchka and asks, Now what shall it be? She says, Raw beets and carrots. He replies, Madame, this is a restaurant, not a meadow. She next says, Bring me something simple &#x96; I never think about food. The waiter asks, If you don't think about food, what do you think about? Ninotchka answers, The future of the common people. And the waiter replies, That's also a question of food. What a great running dialog!Ninotchka was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Garbo for best actress and the film as best picture. That year may have been the best year in motion picture history for the number of great films produced. But for that, Ninotchka likely would have won two or more Oscars. More than 40 full length movies competed for 1939 Oscar honors. Among the best of the year were Gone With the Wind, Stagecoach, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, The Wizard of Oz, Ninotchka, Wuthering Heights, Dark Victory, Beau Geste, Of Mice and Men, Young Mr. Lincoln, Gunga Din, The Four Feathers, Only Angels Have Wings, and Bachelor Mother.

Garbo looks over her hotel suite and says, I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this. And another, when her cohorts take her to the suite they reserved for her. Which part of the room is mine? Garbo asks. And a cohort replies, You see, comrade, it's a little different here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite. One more side-splitter was when her agents asked, How are things in Moscow? Garbo replied, Very good. The last mass trial was a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians. A direct jab at Stalin's Great Purge. Douglas, meeting with the three agents early in the film, says that the jewels owned by the exiled duchess were confiscated by the Soviets. One of the agents quips, I give you my word, they were confiscated legally. In a café later, a waiter seats Ninotchka and asks, Now what shall it be? She says, Raw beets and carrots. He replies, Madame, this is a restaurant, not a meadow. She next says, Bring me something simple &#x96; I never think about food. The waiter asks, If you don't think about food, what do you think about? Ninotchka answers, The future of the common people. And the waiter replies, That's also a question of food. What a great running dialog!Ninotchka was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Garbo for best actress and the film as best picture. That year may have been the best year in motion picture history for the number of great films produced. But for that, Ninotchka likely would have won two or more Oscars. More than 40 full length movies competed for 1939 Oscar honors. Among the best of the year were Gone With the Wind, Stagecoach, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, The Wizard of Oz, Ninotchka, Wuthering Heights, Dark Victory, Beau Geste, Of Mice and Men, Young Mr. Lincoln, Gunga Din, The Four Feathers, Only Angels Have Wings, and Bachelor Mother. Those top 15 films have a combined average viewer rating (on September 20, 2012) of 7.8. Has there been another year of more great movies than that?

The Green Mile is based off the novel by the one and only Stephen King so I knew the movie was going to be interesting to say the least. It is about a death row guard from 1935 who gets his life changed forever when he meets John Coffey. Duncan plays a massive, black, man on death row. He is sentenced to death because he savagely murdered two young girls. Coffey has explained powers which adds twists and turns to this story. This movie had very unexpected parts and by the end I was satisfied and definitely surprised. John Coffey's first lines are him asking if they leave the lights on at night because he is scared of the dark sometimes. The look on Paul's face made the entire scene. Here stands a large, black, man who could lift a truck asking to leave the lights on. Its little comic moments like that which makes this movie different and unexpected. There were little bits of comedy in one of the most depressing places on the planet. Mr. Jingles is very symbolic. The little mouse runs around, becomes a thorn in Percy's side, and befriends Del and Paul. He is more than a mouse and more of an actual character. Tom Hanks delivers another fantastic performance as the star in this film. He has a bladder disease or some disease which makes it hard to use the bathroom. I thought that would have been very important to the story but it was and was not at the same time. It was a problem that got solved quickly, possibly halfway into the movie. Paul is his name and he has to deal with many problems such as, inmates, Percy the spoiled guard, Mr. Jingles the rat, and sometimes John Coffey and what he believes is right. John Coffey has this special power that is never really explained. That really bugged me but how could one have explained it. Coffey claims he can see life and see who's a good man and a bad man. I don't even think he understands and it adds uniqueness to his character. He touches Paul right in the crotch and cures him of his bladder disease. That was fine but in the beginning it seemed like it was going to be a big problem throughout the movie and it was gone and forgotten in a matter of minutes. Coffey can resurrect the dead, extend life, control others, and cure illness. When Del got the electric chair he felt the electricity going through his body and he felt the same pain. It was strange but fascinating. Every movie has a villain; I'm talking about Percy of course. The rich, spoiled, spoon-fed brat who likes to bully prisoners around just because he can. He is small and annoying but he is crafty. He is the real rat, not Mr. Jingles. He is the nephew of the Governor and he can get away with anything he wants. I hated him and hope he gets put on the chair. Del made Percy wet his pants in fear and Percy was embarrassed. Percy got back at him by stepping on Mr. Jingles and killing him. Luckily Coffey was able to revive Mr. Jingles and save his life. Percy had the final word when he did not wet the sponge when Del was sentenced to death. The sponge needs to be wet so it acts as a conductor so the electricity goes to the brain. Instead he fries, and screams, and gets lit on fire. It was gruesome and almost hard to watch. His shrieks and screams and the reaction of the people in the execution room were terrible. He smelled and was burning, smoke was everywhere and they tried to escape. The electricity could not be stopped because he was still alive, so he suffered. No man deserves that and he suffered because of the little rat Percy. Luckily, that little slime ball got his in the end. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Throughout the movie Coffey uses his power but he was still sentenced to death. In a way he wanted to die, he didn't want to live with his gift anymore. He righted some wrongs and it was hard for him to be executed. The guards cared about him and did not want to see him die. Paul shook his hand before he gave the order. A mask is usually put over the face of the prisoner but Coffey wanted it to remain uncovered because he is afraid of the dark. That was so powerful, out of respect his last wished are granted and it was not fair but it was what needed to happen. The most significant part of his death was the reaction of the guards. In every other execution the camera was focused on the prisoner. When Coffey died the camera was not on him at all, it was on the guards who he impacted. A few were in tears and the biggest, toughest guard was fighting back tears. It was powerful, meaningful, symbolic, and important. Before he died he passes something to Paul and we go back to Paul as an old man. His wife he is with doesn't really believe his story but Paul shows her a little box, a box with Mr. Jingles inside of it. He lived all those years. John passed long life to both Mr. Jingles and Paul. The movie closes with Paul saying life is one long green mile. Overall, The Green Mile was three full hours of great cinema. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves Stephen King and Tom Hanks. You have to invest your time into it and pay attention. I would see it again, I bought it, not on Blu Ray but it really doesn't matter. The Green Mile gets the WillyT seal of approval.

Or is he? The word of mouth for it was strong, but no sooner did it hit cinemas than it disappeared off the face of the earth. However, the cult cinema world is often a vibrant place to lurk, enter there and you find The Salton Sea, a wonderfully tricksy and off beat neo-noir awash with misery, revenge, redemption and odd ball characters that are either stuck in purgatory, or heading to nowhereville.Protagonist Danny Parker leads the film, a man whose identity is fractured after being dealt a blow from the hands of fate, very much in limbo mentally, he none the less has goals to achieve, nothing is never quite as it seems until director Caruso wants us in on the side-shifts. Danny is often in the company of danger and weird characters, from a hopped up harpoon wielding loon, to a no nose psycho (too much meth up the nose will make you lose it kids), via dirty cops and meth heads, it's a world of unease, the twisty plot drawing the viewer in with a kinky smile on its face.Caruso also pulls off the neat trick of placing humour in this off kilter world without hurting the dramatic harshness of the thematics. There's a quite brilliant sequence that shows a botched crime being attempted by the meth head crew, this we watch at the same time as they discuss about actually pulling the crime off. That it involves a stool sample from Bob Hope should tell you all you need to know about the intelligence of the wannabe perps! Caruso's camera is fluid and he uses certain neo-noir visual tricks of the trade as well (time lapses etc), and he also has a knack for varying the mood without avertying the slowly bubbling to the surface pace that the story requires.Kilmer is superb, perfectly low-key, there is no need for rage, the yearning for revenge and redemption, for identity, is brought out via calmly delivered dialect, and it's very affecting. D'Onofrio as Pooh Bear, the afore mentioned no nose fella, steals the movie with another of his off the planet nut-jobs. Elsewhere, Sarsgard is as appealing as he has ever been as Danny's stoner best mate, Hutchinson and LaPaglia cut fine figures as dirty cops, while Guzmán and Danny Trejo leave an impressively grungy mark. The only disappointment is the lack of screen time for Kara Unger, a fine actress, she is playing what turns out to be a critical femme fatale role, but really we needed more of her.

Elsewhere, Sarsgard is as appealing as he has ever been as Danny's stoner best mate, Hutchinson and LaPaglia cut fine figures as dirty cops, while Guzmán and Danny Trejo leave an impressively grungy mark. The only disappointment is the lack of screen time for Kara Unger, a fine actress, she is playing what turns out to be a critical femme fatale role, but really we needed more of her. It's a rare misstep in an otherwise cracking neo-noir that is highly recommended to fans of similarly devilishly fun pictures. 8.5\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"20 September 2012","score":"11 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" The people who are behind this piece of intergalactic monkey diarrhea must've had a mental disease.

Byatt novel of the same name, follows two interweaving love stories. Taking place more than a century apart, both romances rotate around a love for literature, a love which is designed to echo both our and LaBute's love for prose, but which doesn't quite work on screen. LaBute's not strong enough a visualist, and much of his film simply consists of dry letter reading and dull narration.The film's present day romance stars Aaron Eckhart and Gwyneth Paltrow. He's an American scholar in London on a fellowship to study celebrated Victorian poet Randolph Ash, she's a professor researching the life of Ash's suspected lover, another Victorian poet named Christabel LaMotte. In an attempt to get to some historical truth, Eckhart and Paltrow track down poems, letters and correspondences between these two Victorians, and of course become romantically engaged as they do so.Though more flowery than LaBute's other films, Possession never strays far from LaButian cynicism. For most of its running time love is portrayed as being inherently possessive, an act of acquisition, rife with double-speak, deception and mad longings. Our characters in the present &#x96; both cold, stuffy academics &#x96; themselves maintain a modern scepticism toward romance. Eventually, however, the film becomes perhaps the most optimistic of LaBute's relationship films; social mores, constrictions and preconceptions come falling down, there remains the hint or hope of something more and our heroes themselves seem to learn about a way of loving that has been lost to their (post-)modern selves.It's immensely difficult to make a film about literary detectives. Polanski did well with The Ghost Writer and The Ninth Gate, but he's an old hand with a camera. LaBute's less sure of himself, and seems to think orally (or with prose?) rather than visually. Much of his film consists of unintentionally funny shots of rolling British countrysides and po-faced letter reading. Bizarrely, LaBute also opts to change the nationality of Eckhart's character. This destroys an entire subplot from Byatt's novel, which painted the dying of a literary\/academic class and portrayed a wealthy man's possessive and obsessive postimperial, neocolonial mission to appropriate the past &#x96; to shut it down and forbid others from delving into it &#x96; and seal it instead into antiseptic, air-conditioned multi-media storage rooms.
