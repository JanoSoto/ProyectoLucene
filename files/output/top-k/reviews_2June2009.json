Marlon Wayans is their junkie friend, Tyrone, along for the pipe dream.Ellen Burstyn is Harry's pill-popping mother, Sara, enamored with an afternoon television game show enough to hallucinate herself into it.Aronofsky shines his glaring light not just on the emptiness and false hope of heroin addiction, but on the seemingly innocuous addictions of prescription drugs. While Harry, Marion and Tyrone run the gamut of heroin's follies (street killings, their savings dwindling to nothing while promising themselves they'll make it back with One Big Score, being driven to prostitution, gangrene from needle overuse), Sara becomes obsessed with losing weight via pills to fit into a red dress for an imagined TV appearance - by the time the dress fits her skeletal frame, nothing really matters anymore.Burstyn's bravura performance admitting truths about the emptiness of old peoples' lives is scary. It is astounding how deep she goes.When Harry discovers his mum is popping weight pills, he lectures her, You don't wanna turn into a dope fiend. Of course, this hypocrisy falls on deaf ears.Araonofsky is an emotive film-maker. Everything that comes at us from the screen is geared towards stirring our innards, presented in the most jarring manner possible. Yet Aronofsky does not try to shock with the actual taking of the drugs, like TRAINSPOTTING; instead, whenever his characters fix, it is purveyed in a few crash cuts of iconic visuals. Makes it all the more effective, focusing on the consequences.With the Kronos Quartet soundtrack evoking darkness and disturbia, REQUIEM touches nerves we thought we'd wiped from our memory in young rock bands and college parties and street denizens spouting all the same inanities, like listening to people in jail holding cells, all saying the same things so many times (What are you in for?

When they're not getting into trouble, they're shooting up or just talking. There's no real story; the movie is more of a look into the lives of these junkies than anything else.One of the main strengths of Trainspotting is that it only shows. It doesn't judge these people or the drug, it simply shows their lives and is careful not to take a side. But it doesn't pull any punches, either, so quite a few people won't want to watch the graphic heroin injections. The movie also goes too far at several points, showing both Renton taking a dump and a dead baby, just to disgust and shock the audience, it seems.It's not an easy movie to sit through because of its graphic nature, but it can be likable as well. Despite obvious reasons to dislike the character, Ewan McGregor's performance as Renton makes him at least a little appealing. His witty and clever narration is very enjoyable, and the best part of the movie. A few chuckles are hidden here and there, and director Danny Boyle makes Trainspotting visually striking, particularly with creative hallucinations and fantasies.But it's also rushed. Renton and his friends are barely established before things go wrong and change, while the third act seems to belong in another movie. As a whole, though, it's a picture that has quite a few things to enjoy, but not everyone will be able to sit through because of its content.

Yet you think can it hold up even when the huge (and clever, and amazing) trick of the plot is no surprise?Yes.And for starters there is the start, a profoundly beautiful and slick telling of the really the whole story, the gist of it. Two taxis, two men shown with their shoes, each walking onto the train, sitting then across from each other, and, oops, a mistake, a little nudge, and the conversation begins, and we see the men themselves. They are interchangeable. The tone here is characteristic of Hitchcock, as it is in many horror and suspense films-- cheery and light. We know entering the film, however, that this won't be the case, so already we are worried. What, after all, is about to go wrong?A lot. In truly Hitchcock fashion, it is a purely innocent man (nearly always a man) who faces injustice, who is trapped by circumstance threatening what is most valuable to him. The innocent in this case, tennis player Guy Haynes, is played with an innocence that is believable--his collegiate politeness in that first scene, for example, as he realizes the other man is a little cuckoo, is just what you or I might do. The not-so-innocent man is the self- absorbed and scarily intelligent spoiled child, Bruno Anthony, played with utter brilliance by Robert Walker. (This uncanny performance is equivalent to that of another Hitchcock wacko, played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho.) So from scene one, on the train (and the train, really gorgeous!), we have the two leads and we have the mind-blowing and utterly simple and ultimately devastating plot, from the first novel by Patricia Highsmith, who also wrote the books behind the two Mr. Ripley movies. And it doesn't hurt that the screenplay was co- written by Raymond Chandler himself, who knows something about economy and clever dialog. And crime.And of course there is more than just the first scene. What to note? Well, that smarty of a senator's daughter (I thought she was terrific) is Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, who is still with us (as of 2009; she also had a role in Psycho). And there is a characteristic landmark location for a key scene in the film--the tennis courts in the Hamptons, known to us as the site of the U.S. Open. The fantastic last full scene with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock moves into a kind of slow and steady montage, building up the suspense by making it surreal. The fear gets positively fattening with the laughing children and the old man crawling underneath it all. And when it collapses in a crash--that's all backprojected on a set, one of the more naturalistic uses by a director known for not worrying about the realism of his back projections.The photography is that perfect Hollywood stunning without becoming so stylized (as in some noir films) that it is an object in its own right. Look again at the first scene, or the shooting (and editing) of Haynes entering the house for what the audience thinks is a murder. This is sophisticated construction. When we are not completely surprised that it's Bruno in the bed, that only proves that the director has us on our toes. Something unexpected is always expected.Are there glitches? Who knows? It depends on what kind of falseness you can accept (or embrace) as beautiful style. The scene where Bruno is choking the old woman at a party is both brilliant (the woman, played by Norma Varden, is a caricature so believable it takes your breath away) and marred by his looking at the senator's daughter and being triggered into a deadly trance by her glasses, and her resemblance to his earlier victim. This is a mid-20th Century idea of psychology that intrudes on many of Hitchcock's efforts. (The end of Psycho, for starters.)The Wikipedia article on the film smartly emphasizes the consistent doubling of things in the movie, from the main characters to the murder victim and the senator's daughter. This echoes in lots of little ways--two men trail him to the tennis court, two men accompany the victim to the amusement park, and so on. There can be too much made of this, but it does supply an aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness. Don't forget, there are meant to be two murders--it is the lack of the second murder, the inability to create a doubling in that case, that causes Bruno to unravel.Walker the actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized in the year before this movie was shot, and just afterwards, he died from a reaction to a drug used to calm one of his outbursts. Though he appeared in other films, Strangers on a Train is easily his tour-de- force. Farley Granger had a long career that never quite saw him break into true stardom, though his style can have a peculiar nervous sweetness that really works, especially in They Live by Night. And if you watch this one for the first or third time, do look for the chilling and hilarious scene at the tennis match where the crowd's heads all move back and forth in unison-- except for Bruno's. He is staring out without moving his head straight at us. As the trailer for the movie says, after this movie, you won't be talking to strangers on a train.

The scene where Bruno is choking the old woman at a party is both brilliant (the woman, played by Norma Varden, is a caricature so believable it takes your breath away) and marred by his looking at the senator's daughter and being triggered into a deadly trance by her glasses, and her resemblance to his earlier victim. This is a mid-20th Century idea of psychology that intrudes on many of Hitchcock's efforts. (The end of Psycho, for starters.)The Wikipedia article on the film smartly emphasizes the consistent doubling of things in the movie, from the main characters to the murder victim and the senator's daughter. This echoes in lots of little ways--two men trail him to the tennis court, two men accompany the victim to the amusement park, and so on. There can be too much made of this, but it does supply an aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness. Don't forget, there are meant to be two murders--it is the lack of the second murder, the inability to create a doubling in that case, that causes Bruno to unravel.Walker the actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized in the year before this movie was shot, and just afterwards, he died from a reaction to a drug used to calm one of his outbursts. Though he appeared in other films, Strangers on a Train is easily his tour-de- force. Farley Granger had a long career that never quite saw him break into true stardom, though his style can have a peculiar nervous sweetness that really works, especially in They Live by Night. And if you watch this one for the first or third time, do look for the chilling and hilarious scene at the tennis match where the crowd's heads all move back and forth in unison-- except for Bruno's. He is staring out without moving his head straight at us. As the trailer for the movie says, after this movie, you won't be talking to strangers on a train.

Hitchcock insisted on using the ground-breaking technique from Disney to combine two different backgrounds and foregrounds to create shots that seem to be together but really weren't.

As Dr Otternschlag (Lewis Stone) knowingly muses, Grand Hotel&#x85; always the same. People come, people go. Nothing ever happens. Edmund Goulding's Oscar-winning 'Grand Hotel (1932)' is a mere snapshot of several days in the life of Berlin's finest rest-stop, in which lives are changed forever, and yet the guests' full stories can never be known. An astonishing cast &#x96; Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery, Jean Hersholt &#x96; introduced a new style of storytelling, with ensemble casts of unrelated characters whose lives inexplicably interweave. A slew of imitations followed in the early 1930s, and author Graham Greene was inspired to write his first successful novel, Stamboul Train.In 1932, the United States was still in the midst of the Great Depression, but Hollywood was optimistic. Producers knew that audiences flocked to cinemas precisely to escape their own worrisome lives, to temporarily imagine themselves beside their favourite movie stars in glittering surroundings. Films like 'Grand Hotel (1932)' and 'Top Hat (1935)' delivered on this promise, with extravagant hotel rooms and wealthy businessmen flaunting their wealth. The dreams of the working-class are depicted through Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore), an unremarkable clerk whose impending death prompts him to splurge his savings and enjoy his final weeks. The cycle of life is used allegorically to symbolise the circular narrative of life at a hotel. While hotel porter Senf (Jean Hersholt) awaits news of his child's birth, a guest awaits his own death. By the film's end, one man is dead, and a baby is born. Other characters are abandoned before their stories have reached a satisfactory conclusion, mimicking the continuous nature of life itself.The film's cast is occasionally hampered by an acting style left over from the silent era, but is otherwise excellent.

Those two points belong to Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas, which plays up the highs and lows of gangster life in cold truth, without any jazzed-up one-liners or thematic scores, with only honest-to-goodness storytelling and direction.Some crime films rely on characters killing or torturing people in crazy and memorable ways, but in Goodfellas, when the only nutty character, Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), blows his fuse a few times, it feels jarring and unnatural, not cool or awing in any way. It's because to Scorsese, these people are real, this is their life, and a hit is a hit because that's how they do things -- there's not a production to be made out of it. The film, based on true events with much consultation from the real life people who were being portrayed in the film, focuses on gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and how the mob raised him and gave him everything he had, brought him the highest of highs and took him pretty low -- might have even killed him had he not entered the Witness Protection Program in the '80s. Scorsese isn't brilliant in this film. It's not visionary. Leave that for some of his other films -- this is just incredibly good storytelling. As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster is not a memorable line that pulls you in at the film's beginning because it was inspired writing -- it's Scorsese understanding how to take a script and bring it to life in the best way possible. The only truly artistic work being done is some of the camera shots and compelling angles. He finds the script's best moments and adds something to them. Otherwise, he is telling this story, he is making a cinematic homage to this incredible true story as penned by Nicholas Pileggi.Of course it helps that the actors he had to work with were top notch.

Both characters are easily provoked, sometimes irrational men with big mouths their hearts in the right place despite actions to the contrary. Pesci is particularly memorable between the in what way am I funny? and deer paw scenes, a deserved Oscar for great character work. As for Liotta, his great strength is swaying our opinion of him back and forth with his various infidelities yet natural charms -- it's a role that had Scorsese cast 15 years later would have gone to the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, so let that stand as some acclaim for Liotta. It is also this dichotomy of warm support and foul-mouthed matter-of-factness that makes us feel conflicted as we watch the entire film. It doesn't elicit pity for the mafia, but it certainly complicates the wiseguy stereotype, which I think is much of Scorsese's goal.Goodfellas only lacks in an emotional or cathartic pull.

She manages to squeeze every note of the music of human language into simple words like found and handbag. Margaret Rutherford and Miles Malleson, two famous and prolific actors of the British dotty school come very close to being ideal for their more minor parts of (respectfully) Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble.For the young lovers, the women are well chosen and make a fine contrast. Sultry-voiced Joan Greenwood has had a solid film career to this point (including the Alec Guiness classic Man in a White Suit) and she knows how to deliver a comic line. Then new-comer Dorthy Tutin is so good with her lines, you'd think she was an old-hand, rather than a fresh-faced, twenty-two year old newcomer making her first major film appearance.The young men are sometimes thought of as more problematic. Michael Redgrave (unfortunately known these days more for being the father of Vanessa and Lynn than for his great acting) was in his forties. Mainly stage-bound actor Michael Denison was in his thirties. Denison wonderfully limns the all-important character of Algernon Moncrieff. He's young-looking and exuberant and delivers his lines with great care and consideration (Algernon is an easy character to go hammy with and Denison avoids that trap).For his part, Redgrave compensates for his age by an exquisitely-honed performance. Not only is his delivery spot-on, he practically gives a workshop on how to get a laugh with a slight twitch of a mustache or the roll of an eye. Redgrave and Denison seem to be having a high old time with their roles, while taking them seriously and never overacting.Also, be on the look-out for long-time supporting actor Richard Wattis as Seton. Blink, and you'll miss him, as he flits in to raise a supercilious eyebrow or two.Some Wilde purists may object to the expurgation of lines. Many of the lines cut are the sort of thing that probably just struck Wilde as a good idea at the time and no one will miss them. Other lines may have been cut to keep this movie short, light and frothy. Wilde could be very funny, but he could also be unnecessarily cruel. I don't think he would have been a nice man to know, the way he could sling around hurtful lines to humorous effect. All his characters have been accused of talking like Wilde -- which is true to different degrees. A few of the missing lines were genuine, polished gems and it was a pity they weren't included. Also, the sub-plot of Grisby, which only appears in longer versions of the play, does not rear its ugly head in this short version (and good riddance). I, for one, am glad they kept the movie light and without a mean bone in its body.The movie has also been changed subtly from the stage. The stage version has the action taking place on a minimum of sets. The movie remains bound to the sound-stage and never really ventures out of doors (even in the outdoors scenes) but it adds a few more sets and more mobility. For instance, it begins in Jack's flat rather than in Algernon's. For me, this works even better than the stage version and gives Jack a good reason to throw one of Algernon's lines back in his face.So, you have a good play shorn of overmuch dialogue and a solid cast acting their hearts out.

There are no clunkers in the cast and hardly a wrong step is made, even when Wilde is altered.Dame Edith Evans did not make her stage debut until fifteen years after Earnest first premiered, so Oscar Wilde could not have had her in mind when he created the role of Lady Bracknell; but she is so perfect it becomes difficult to imagine anyone else in the part, ever. She manages to squeeze every note of the music of human language into simple words like found and handbag. Margaret Rutherford and Miles Malleson, two famous and prolific actors of the British dotty school come very close to being ideal for their more minor parts of (respectfully) Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble.For the young lovers, the women are well chosen and make a fine contrast. Sultry-voiced Joan Greenwood has had a solid film career to this point (including the Alec Guiness classic Man in a White Suit) and she knows how to deliver a comic line. Then new-comer Dorthy Tutin is so good with her lines, you'd think she was an old-hand, rather than a fresh-faced, twenty-two year old newcomer making her first major film appearance.The young men are sometimes thought of as more problematic. Michael Redgrave (unfortunately known these days more for being the father of Vanessa and Lynn than for his great acting) was in his forties. Mainly stage-bound actor Michael Denison was in his thirties. Denison wonderfully limns the all-important character of Algernon Moncrieff. He's young-looking and exuberant and delivers his lines with great care and consideration (Algernon is an easy character to go hammy with and Denison avoids that trap).For his part, Redgrave compensates for his age by an exquisitely-honed performance. Not only is his delivery spot-on, he practically gives a workshop on how to get a laugh with a slight twitch of a mustache or the roll of an eye. Redgrave and Denison seem to be having a high old time with their roles, while taking them seriously and never overacting.Also, be on the look-out for long-time supporting actor Richard Wattis as Seton. Blink, and you'll miss him, as he flits in to raise a supercilious eyebrow or two.Some Wilde purists may object to the expurgation of lines. Many of the lines cut are the sort of thing that probably just struck Wilde as a good idea at the time and no one will miss them. Other lines may have been cut to keep this movie short, light and frothy. Wilde could be very funny, but he could also be unnecessarily cruel. I don't think he would have been a nice man to know, the way he could sling around hurtful lines to humorous effect. All his characters have been accused of talking like Wilde -- which is true to different degrees. A few of the missing lines were genuine, polished gems and it was a pity they weren't included. Also, the sub-plot of Grisby, which only appears in longer versions of the play, does not rear its ugly head in this short version (and good riddance). I, for one, am glad they kept the movie light and without a mean bone in its body.The movie has also been changed subtly from the stage. The stage version has the action taking place on a minimum of sets. The movie remains bound to the sound-stage and never really ventures out of doors (even in the outdoors scenes) but it adds a few more sets and more mobility. For instance, it begins in Jack's flat rather than in Algernon's. For me, this works even better than the stage version and gives Jack a good reason to throw one of Algernon's lines back in his face.So, you have a good play shorn of overmuch dialogue and a solid cast acting their hearts out. I don't know why I call it Almost Perfect.

There is a brief mentioning of his back story but generally he's just insane and laughs allot. But really, it's all about The Riddler. He is given a complete back-story of how he came to be and is played By Jim Carrey. Carrey completely steals the show and almost pushes everyone else out of the story. Allot may disagree, but i didn't think he was The Riddler as much as he was just Jim Carrey. So much of his performance can be related straight back to Ace Ventura which came out only just before this. Nicole Kidman is in it as well but to be honest, her character was so boring that barely remember her. Oh, Robin is also in it played by Chris O'Donnell but I'm not really sure why they found it necessary to include him.

Reading through a lot of the comments, I noticed that many compared this film to Rob Reiner's Stand By Me. I guess I would consider the two to be of the same genre (coming of age), but, to me, that's really the only thing the two have in common.Now and Then is a fun film. It's got quick and easy laughs that many (not just teenage girls) people will find humorous. I will say that Then is vastly more entertaining than Now; the adult versions of the characters briefly open and close the story, with forgettable filler in between. Then offers some slight depth of character for the four girls who embody stereotypes of adolescent girls (the princess, the tomboy, the sheltered one, the seemingly normal one). Now still embraces those stereotypes (the princess has become an actress, still obsessed with body image; the normal one has become a writer, who showcases her intellect by wearing black and smoking). There is no growth amongst the adults. Now is focused on Chrissy's pregnancy and reminiscing, while Then seems to get distracted amongst its various subplots (unraveling Crazy Pete, watching parents fight, bicker with boys, watch movies, build a tree house, ride bikes) without ever really coming to a true conclusion.For a movie hailed as a Stand By Me for girls, the film is lacking in its overall sincerity. Whereas Reiner's film grapples (and in some cases overcomes) 'mature' themes like death, acceptance, and separation, Glatter's film skates over the big issues. Stand By Me captures true childhood friendship (friends help friends get leeches off their backs) Now and Then is only truly poignant, well, now and then.I'd recommend Now and Then for a time when you are in the mood for something lighthearted and distracting. I'd second the opinion that it's great for a girl's sleepover or something. But if you are looking for something a little deeper and, in my opinion, more true to childhood friendship, I'd tell you to skip this movie and go straight to Stand By Me. Note Stand By Me is rated R; Now and Then PG-13. Both films have great soundtracks.

It is no surprise then that both have had their fair share of encounters in the past in an attempt by studios to bring the bucks of monsters and alien fans all in the one take. The sad reality of this however is that much of the time this usually results in a story that is tepid and ultimately see-through in its exploitative nature. In fact, up until Alien which came out in the late 1970's, the horror sci-fi flick was one plagued with dead-pan or over the top acting, formulaic plots and dialogue fit to be spoken only by pieces of furniture. The reasoning behind this is simple; to get the balance between such polarising genres fit enough to overcome the hard-sell nature of each, such a movie's script needs to be intricately developed and picked apart in order to nail that fine line between crass genre movie and entertaining crossover romp.Event Horizon which seeks to tread down the path Ridley Scott paved two decades earlier is an example of new ideas meshing with old ones; Anderson's film is a whole lot less cerebral and frightening that either of the first two alien pictures, but it is nevertheless interesting in its own light. Most of the feature takes place on board a mysterious ship that has the capability of creating black holes in order to travel vast distances of space and time in a fraction of the standard rate. The problem however is that instead of taking the ship across the galaxy or even to the other side of the universe, the Event Horizon instead creates a link to another dimension&#x97;loosely described and referred to through as hell. Of course, the term is entirely ambiguous (and thankfully so), but the connotations are not left hanging in the imagination. Event Horizon takes blood, guts, torture and pain to high levels here, fully getting across what awaits the crew at the other side of that portal, and such moments are usually what give the film its real source of vibrancy and zest.What doesn't work quite as well however is the clashing of science-fiction (read spaceships, technological babble and futuristic settings) and horror which too often seem far too overt and biased towards the horror side of things. To be fair, much of the feature's greatest moments come when we as viewers are subjected to moments of rapidly quick flashes of gore and horror, but there are certain scenes laced throughout that never quite work as well. Particularly irksome are the many cliché, what's that behind you moments quickly followed by a cheap explosion of sound punctuated by Michael Kamen's bombastic score (which, you know, would have been fine for another Die Hard movie, but just consistently feels out of place and detractive here). This, in tow with an ending as anti-climactic, predictable and utterly un-engaging as you could possibly imagine, ends up turning an otherwise decent and claustrophobic Alien wannabe into something akin to a 1950's exploitation genre movie with superb visual effects.To screenwriter Philip Eisner's credit, there are numerous highlights inherent to Event Horizon's story (most notably being the characters who&#x97;although a tad derivative at times&#x97;nevertheless help flesh the movie out past its 2D plotting), but a distinct lack of conviction or subtlety to the overarching plot of the proceedings inevitably hurts the production as a whole. The result is a sporadically interesting and compelling feature with stretches of ten or so minutes at a time that are practically flawless&#x97;and yet the material that binds such moments together is weak and overly bland. If there is one thing that will taken from the experience however it is the memory of its horror and fantastic visuals (captured by Adrian Biddle, who unsurprisingly enough, did the same thing for Aliens in 1986) which consistently use the elaborate sets and visual effects to convey the ideas and themes of Eisner's script aptly.

Everyone knew Nicole was going to be good after Dead Calm but this is the best role she has ever played by far -- sweet,sexy,deceptive, vile on the turn of a dime like only she could make believable. The most outstanding performance amongst these excellent performances in movies is Anne Bancroft who won an Oscar previously but should have got at least nominated for this film. Watch twice her scene to appreciate her gestures, timing, expressions, as Mrs. Kennsinger -- she made you entranced by the reality of her character in a few short lines. Bill Pullman is a very likable actor who is good in his role as a naive husband. Just so everyone does not think I blindly adore every actors performance in this film. Bill is a very solid actor but against some of these amazing scene stealing performances he did not stand out as much as he could with his character. Gwyneth Paltrow, and Beb Neuwirth also contribute to the quality of this amazing,and one of the earlier ensemble cast movies that is not recognized for the outstanding quality throughout of the cast.Malice is one of the most underrated movies of all time. Rent, Download, review Malice several times to appreciate the writing, the actors craft and then re-rate it highly as it deserves. Please send to the websites of those involved in the movie (director,writers, actors, etc.) your compliments as they all mention how valuable working with each other on this movie was to them but do not mention the name of the movie because it was so underrated. Please do a little bit to help set the world straight(theme in the movie) and do something positive to help this movie ultimately get rewarded as it deserves. Remember the line Did I get what I deserved?Thank you ","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"2 June 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Tony Wendice discovers that his wife Margot is having an affair with Mark, an American writer. Wendice blackmails an old college friend with a murky past into killing Margot while he and Mark are at a party, thereby giving him a perfect alibi. But of course there's no such thing as the perfect murder &#x85;Hitchcock was a little disparaging of this movie, famously quipping that he could have phoned it in. And yes, perhaps it is a bit stagy and talky, but that's doing it an injustice - it's a brilliant little thriller, with a terrific twist in the middle and a fantastic denouement involving a misplaced latchkey. It has a great villainous leading performance by Milland and a deliriously overenthusiastic score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Most importantly, Hitch fills it from start to finish with delicious visual flourishes; Tony spilling salt (foreshadowing his doom), the lovers' shadows parting on the door, Swan's shoes squeaking as he paces out the apartment, Tony's chilling goodnight kiss as he leaves Margot for what he thinks will be the last time, Swan's gleefully horrible demise, many others. The mechanics of the plot keep us gripped, but the director adds so much flavour with tightly composed shots, dramatic lighting and maximum suspense. I must confess I think this film has a liability however, and it's Kelly, in the first of her three roles for Hitchcock. She's a fair player but she has almost no range - check out the aftermath of the attack scene, where she simply is unable to play hysteria or look less than perfect to camera; all we see is her back and hear her voice over a phone. A great actress can play anything, and isn't concerned with how she looks, so Kelly doesn't qualify. This minor quibble aside however, this is a perfectly crafted little murder thriller that hasn't aged a day since it was shot. Based on a first-rate stage play by Frederic Knott - for another great film written by him, check out Wait Until Dark. Remade several times for TV and perhaps most interestingly as a feature in 1988 called A Perfect Murder, but as with so many movies the original is the best.

That famous line, from one of the most famous scenes ever put on film, is the thing most remembered about On the Waterfront. But this film is so much more than one memorable scene. It's a gripping, powerful drama. It's a film which presents a simple yet fascinating story, a story which can be both inspiring and tragic. At its heart it's a story of one man, Terry Malloy, struggling to do the right thing. And Brando's performance in the role is simply stunning, justifiably hailed as one of the greatest performances of all time.The plot centers on corruption on the docks where Terry works. Union boss Johnny Friendly, played rather bombastically by Lee J. Cobb, is in complete control on the waterfront. His illegal activities are not limited to lining his pockets with ill-gotten cash. Right at the film's beginning it is a Johnny Friendly-ordered murder which sets the plot into motion. Terry finds himself an unwitting accomplice in the killing of a dockworker who dared to testify against the union. That's what happens to rats and Terry's no rat. He's content to dummy up and say nothing until he meets the dead man's sister. Eva Marie Saint plays Edie Doyle, a woman who will push Terry to do the right thing. Determined to find out who killed her brother Edie enlists the help of a local priest, Father Barry, who overcomes his initial reluctance to take it upon himself to clean up the docks. But for all their good intentions Edie and Father Barry are never going to be able to make much headway unless they have cooperation from someone on the inside. And as they proceed they will be reminded all too clearly of the grim consequences for anyone who dares to speak the truth. Despite the danger, for both himself and for his brother who happens to be Johnny Friendly's lawyer, Terry Malloy begins to see what it is he must do. A conscience can be a dangerous thing. But finally Terry Malloy is gonna be somebody. He's not a bum anymore.Perhaps the film does lay it on a bit thick in its presentation of Terry Malloy as the Messiah of the docks. But knowing director Elia Kazan's own personal life story that's understandable. The statement Kazan makes to his critics with this film is quite clear. There is no denying the power of this story, a story which holds up brilliantly more than half a century later. And the cast is almost uniformly terrific in bringing the story to the screen. Brando's legendary performance obviously stands out but the contributions from those around him are key as well. Brando got his Oscar but so did Saint who did wonderfully in her first film role. She plays off Brando so well. The relationship between Edie and Terry is a fascinating one as she uses him to seek justice for her brother without really knowing the role he had to play in her brother's demise. As Terry finds himself falling for Edie the secret he keeps from her always lurks in the background. There's that conscience again.Apart from Brando and Saint there are three more major roles. Cobb makes for a terrific villain. The sense of menace when Johnny Friendly is on the screen is quite palpable. Karl Malden is very good in his role as Father Barry although he does have a few moments where he's a bit over the top. One scene in particular, with Father Barry giving a speech over a dead body in the hold of a cargo ship, sticks out as being a little awkward. It doesn't quite seem to fit with the tone of the rest of the film. But all in all Malden does well. And then, playing Terry's brother Charley, there is Rod Steiger. His may seem like a small role, not nearly as important as those of the other four big name stars. And then he steps into the back of a taxicab and steps right into film immortality. Brando and Steiger, Terry and Charley, two brothers in one of the most emotional, heart-breaking scenes you will ever see. You can feel the pain these characters feel. Brilliant acting, brilliant film-making. It's a scene which is a perfect centerpiece for a classic film.

A deeply disturbed individual , who takes pleasure in harassing his unsuspecting victims ? The glimpses of his childhood explain the trauma and the subsequent abnormality . Yet , it's very touching towards the end , when Brodrick tries to prevent Carrey from jumping , but a desperate and eccentric Carrey lets go , and is luckily saved , but suffers major injuries . All the other supporting characters seem so real , and natural .A lot of hard work has gone into script writing and shooting , be it the office meeting scene , while Brodrick is about to be arrested , and his secretary is trying to signal him , or Brodrick speaking to Carrey , when he is behind the bars , and some action of Carrey evokes interest in other prisoners , thinking he is gay ! That was very funny indeed , though it might seem a little vulgar , with Carrey making those slurping sounds with his tongue ! This movie simply attacks you with it's powerful handling , acting and the flow of events , like Naigara falls . Jim is brash , brazen ,yet a lovable psycho ! All those who love him ,or even those who hate him , do see this movie for it's sheer psychological impact .

And to some extent I agree . The plot of the movie has been repeated and copied by so many movies coming after this, that it will be of no use of me explaining it.The characters of this movie have become legends especially of Don Vito Corleone played by the great Marlon Brando. Many other actors in different movie industries tried to emulate this character in their own way but failed to create an impact as huge as Brando created. But the character who keeps his own amongst the geniusness around is Michael Corleone which gave a first glimpse of the acting prowess of one of the greatest actors of this generation Al Pacino . Another actor who impressed is the great Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen) who played the supporting part to perfection. The movie is almost 3 hours long but nowhere the movie loses its grip on the audience .Coppola has made sure that the audiences are craving for what is going to be the next twist in the movie .The best scene in the movie according to me is the Baptism and the enemy killings scene which showcased the great capabilities of the director. I will make him an offer he can't refuse can be called as one of the best dialogues of the cinema history. This is one movie any cinema lover cannot afford to missRating  9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 June 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Cinema lovers all over the world consider this movie as the best movie ever.

The Next Day &#x85; To me, that fully sounds like that dreadful hangover syndrome. You partied hard, drank way too much and did a whole lot of things that seemed like a good idea at the time but now are bound to regret &#x85; In short, you spent an awesome time but then, inevitably, the next day brings a terrible headache. You feel empty, lazy, uninspired and plain simply you want to be left alone. Porky's 2 alarmingly lives up to this unpleasant sentiment. The original is a tremendous guilty pleasure, because it genuinely makes you feel as if you are a sordid and derailed partying teenager again! The vulgar pranks are plentiful and impossible not to laugh with, the gratuitous sleaze is too welcome and the continuous politically incorrect ambiance is simply irresistible. The sequel, however, tastes like a sour after-party in your stomach. Gone is all the harmless entertainment; replaced only by embarrassment and redundant that makes you wonder why you even bothered in the first place. I honestly don't know what happened here &#x85; All of a sudden the infantile jokes make room for boring morality speeches and the act of juvenile delinquency are being replaced with charity initiatives! In the original, our 50's gang of hormone-overloaded adolescent losers already fought against various types of authority (law enforcers, teachers, night club owners&#x85;), but at least they exclusively did so for their own benefit&#x85; To see naked chicks and get laid as quickly as possible. Here, they battle against even tougher types of authority (like politicians and the local church community), but for a greater &#x96; and utterly implausible &#x96; purpose, namely to prevent a high school stage play about the oeuvre of Shakespeare from getting canceled. I'm sorry, what?!? The characters we were introduced to in Porky's wouldn't care less about anything school relate, let alone an art class project! Suddenly the biggest schoolyard perverts have become teacher pets, the school bimbo transformed into the sensitive and understanding type and laughing stock Pee-Wee has turned into the archetype of manliness. Only the one sequence in the graveyard, when Pee Wee hires a prostitute to pull a prank on his friends that evidently backfires, vaguely reminds us that we are &#x96; in fact &#x96; watching an installment in the Porky's franchise. The amount of T&A decreased with approximately 400%, there isn't a single ROTF moment and the morality lessons (don't be a hypocrite) are pitiable. Once more I'm reminded of the classic song by the Dire Straits Heavy Fuel, with its lyrics Last time I was sober, I felt bad. Worst hangover I ever had. That's the next day for ya!

In fact there was a lot more trading going on at the Needful Things store to set up a more grand finale in the book than we get here in this film where it basically has a rather weak ending. Just to much stuff taken out of the book that would have made this movie more chilling, instead it is like the neutered version of the book. Still, the acting is good and the essence of the film is still there, lets face it the book was not exactly one of Stephen King's more chilling and scary tales. The film has a new shop opening up in town and the owner seems a nice enough fellow, however he seems to be playing the town and doing things to cause unrest within. He gets women to attack one another in one of the few scenes that mirrors the book and even the blood in that scene is toned down from what the book made it seem like they did. The sheriff is suspicious, but of course is one or two steps behind.
