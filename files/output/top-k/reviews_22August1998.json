This isn't the kind of movie critics usually like, but, as they should be, most reviews so far are pretty good.Let me start of by saying that I don't usually go for the corny comic book style movie OR the usual shoot-em up action flick. I do however appreciate well-choriographed martial arts action and a good horror flick. Blade manages to combine martial arts action with John Woo-style gunplay, a good horror-vampire plot, funny-but-not-too-funny dark humor, and an ausome techno soundtrack. A little something for everyone. It actually works in every catagory and turns out to be one he** of a fun movie.The directing has that cool music video feal too it and it works perfectly for this type of movie. Wesley Snipes does a good job as Blade and, although sometimes he seems a little too bland, he generally does an excellent job. The rest of the cast does a pretty descent job too.The martial arts action scenes are some of the best ever. Wesley Snipes manages to combine great fighting with guns to create some highly entertaining action sequences.There's not much else to say about this movie. The plot is pretty good, the action scenes are GREAT, there's plenty of humor, the special effects are pretty good too, from the numerous vampire death sequences to some pretty interesting characters that I don't want to give away. This is just a plain FUN movie. One of the best of the genre.ONE LAST THING-- I thought I'd give the FIRST scene of the movie a quick review too. You see, this scene is by far the BEST scene in the movie (don 't get me wrong, the movie is pretty good- but this scene is one of the greatest of all-time).This scene is one of my favorate action scenes of ALL-TIME. The credits are still rolling and already you get the feel for the rest of the movie. A rave-type club full of vampires attempt to feast on an innocent human as SHOWERS of blood begin to POUR from the ceiling. It becomes chaotic as everyone is going crazy to the ausome techno soundtrack. Blood is everywhere, vampires are every, the camera is rapidly changing back-and -forth between slow-motion and fast-forward, they're all about to feast on this guy when BLADE bursts out to kill some Vamps. Now you have gallons of blood covering everything and everybody, you have Blade kicking people all over with both cool martial arts action and special anti-vampire guns, and of course the techno music is still playing to give the audiance that extra rush. It just can't be explained. This scene alone is worth the price of admission.Jesse (pulpjes@aol.com) ","genre":null},{"date":"22 August 1998","score":"","review":"  I just got back from seeing Blade and I thought I'd give it a quick review.

This one is so disappointing !This film tries very hard to be spectacular.  There's a preview on many home videos these days that features clips from classic old films, designed to inspire the viewer to go out and buy or rent movie classics - you know, Gone With the Wind and the like.  I had the same impression, watching The Avengers.  Mr. Freeze and his plan to chill the world, from Batman.  The cat woman's costume and persona, draped on Uma Thurman.  The catwalk fight scene from Moonraker.  Search parties dispatched to locate  James Bond, who turns up in a life raft with his romantic interest.  A sprinkling of the hurricane special effects from Twister.  There's even computer generated special effect attack bugs from an episode of TV's Gene Roddenberry's Earth Final Conflict. To name but a few.Does this producer have a single original thought in his head?  You know, there are places in the world where people get fired for reproducing someone else's work without citing the source like Boston!.Ralph Fiennes, in The English Patient, made me feel his intense love and desire, and his subsequent anguish.  The only anguish I felt watching the Avengers was over the total lack of character development.  Both Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes were trapped into reciting lines that left them no opportunity to flesh out actual characters.  That is not to say that a movie has to be serious for the audience to believe in the hero, James Bond films being a perfect example.  The Avengers fell terribly short.Perhaps Sean Connery got involved in this project, wanting to play the diabolical genius madman, bent on conquering the earth.  What great fun that could be for an actor of his caliber.  The same can be said for the motivations behind Thurman and Fiennes' roles as well-known heroes.  Too bad the script was written so badly, the story so disjointed, to derail even the most devoted fans.  The musical score was just as uninspiring.And tell me, please, what's going on with the greasy guy in the wheelchair sucking down cigarettes?  And the blind chick that is just too weird? What's the motto here?  The bad guys are ugly, handicapped, and bizarre?  I don't get it.What was good about this movie?  If you're into fashion, Thurman's wardrobe was stunning from start to finish.  And sure, for the ladies, seeing Ralph Fiennes in the buff - okay, that was fun (though you didn't really need to do that, Ralph.)This movie will definitely appeal to the average 15 year old, preoccupied with role models who have something cool to say, in any situation.  If you're past the pimple stage in your life, however, these characters are as flat as the screen on which they're projected.Overall, leave this film to rent when it comes out on video (maybe, next week) when you are looking for something mindless to do for 90 minutes.
