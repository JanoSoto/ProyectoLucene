The goofy drug-addled Shorty jumping up and down in front of the news cameras saying this was better than the time he was on Cops was just one highlight of one of the funniest minutes ever put together on screen.Unfortunately, the makers of the movie had to fill some 90 more of them, and this they could not do too well. Scary Movie isn't bad bad. It has funny sections throughout, an unattractive but capable newcomer in lead Anna Faris, and three of the Earp Brothers of comedy, the Wayans, director Keneen Ivory, Marlon (Shorty), and Shawn (not-gay Ray) putting down their considerable talents to the enterprise. I like Cheri Oteri here, too, though the other characters are pretty cardboard, even for a farce.Ultimately this movie is a blend of two better films, the classic Airplane and, more obviously, Scream. Sometimes it works, like in the solid opening with Carmen Electra, a banana, and the funniest non-cameo cameo I've ever seen. That scene works because it plays off the recent memory of Scream in theaters. But the movie quickly drags into a series of elongated, who-cares refs to such lesser fare as I Know What You Did Last Summer and Dawson's Creek. The more it runs, the more you're reminded of how it's been done better before.2000 wasn't all that long ago, but a lot has happened since, and this film feels as lost in time as a high-tech IPO. Take one bit this film has in common with Airplane, the commercial parody. I still laugh when I hear the woman in Airplane think to herself how Jim never has a second cup of coffee at home not just because I'm one of seven people left on the planet who still get that joke but because it's over and out fairly quickly. The Wassup gag in Scary Movie just goes on and on, a memorial to a commercial that lost gravity faster than Spuds McKenzie on Skylab.I really want to lambaste this movie, but it's hard. I liked Faris, as I said (she's prettier in Scary Movie 2, maybe because she isn't sharing that one with Shannon Elizabeth), and the film's eagerness to make you laugh does win you over, at least a little. Even the stupid Riverdance meets Matrix fight scene makes me chuckle, and there are some actual good moments not worth spoiling by enumerating here.Maybe I missed this one by a generation, but I'm not sorry I did. Airplane and Kentucky Fried Movie, even The Cheap Detective, were pretty good for its day, and I guarantee you will hold up better 20 years later than Scary Movie will by the time Bill Gates is ready to retire.Really high raunch factor here, too. Did they really need to have scenes like Ray in the men's room and Carmen losing her implant to get laughs? Buffy's final scene is just too sado-bizarre (probably unintentionally), and the whole Doofy experience leaves an uncomfortable aftertaste.

It has funny sections throughout, an unattractive but capable newcomer in lead Anna Faris, and three of the Earp Brothers of comedy, the Wayans, director Keneen Ivory, Marlon (Shorty), and Shawn (not-gay Ray) putting down their considerable talents to the enterprise. I like Cheri Oteri here, too, though the other characters are pretty cardboard, even for a farce.Ultimately this movie is a blend of two better films, the classic Airplane and, more obviously, Scream. Sometimes it works, like in the solid opening with Carmen Electra, a banana, and the funniest non-cameo cameo I've ever seen. That scene works because it plays off the recent memory of Scream in theaters. But the movie quickly drags into a series of elongated, who-cares refs to such lesser fare as I Know What You Did Last Summer and Dawson's Creek. The more it runs, the more you're reminded of how it's been done better before.2000 wasn't all that long ago, but a lot has happened since, and this film feels as lost in time as a high-tech IPO. Take one bit this film has in common with Airplane, the commercial parody. I still laugh when I hear the woman in Airplane think to herself how Jim never has a second cup of coffee at home not just because I'm one of seven people left on the planet who still get that joke but because it's over and out fairly quickly. The Wassup gag in Scary Movie just goes on and on, a memorial to a commercial that lost gravity faster than Spuds McKenzie on Skylab.I really want to lambaste this movie, but it's hard. I liked Faris, as I said (she's prettier in Scary Movie 2, maybe because she isn't sharing that one with Shannon Elizabeth), and the film's eagerness to make you laugh does win you over, at least a little.

Whereas Arnie had multiple famous characters - The Terminator, Douglas Quaid, Dutch Schaeffer, etc. - Sly only really had two Rocky Balboa and, of course, Rambo. But by this point in the film's series, John Rambo has become more than a man. More than a hero. John Rambo has become a movie franchise.In this film, Rambo is practicing to be a Buddhist monk out in the middle of the Middle East - by kicking butt and raising money for the local Buddhist chapel. When an old comrade of John's asks for his assistance in some matter of war in Afghanistan, Rambo, being a strong, peace-loving, butt-kicking, machine-gun-toting, greased-up Italian Stallion, says no. But when he finds out his comrade has been held captive by those nasty Afghies, he rushes out farther into the Middle East to serve up some fresh Afghanistan carcasses! Yee-haw!Sylvester Stallone has claimed he is returning to this film franchise as soon as he's done milking - er, filming - Rocky VI. When I heard this, I thought back to the image of a younger John Rambo. I wondered what a near-sixty-year-old Rambo would look like. And then, after torturous mental anguish and personal pain, I finally got a mental picture of an older John Rambo. And Reader, when I did finally picture this, I also realized that I didn't really care to see another Rambo action flick after Rambo III. At all. In fact, I think I'd rather die.I've never seen First Blood, a.k.a. Rambo, nor Rambo First Blood Part II. All I know is what I have heard, and that is that the films are action classics. Do people look for actual quality in Rambo movies? I think anyone that does has a serious hole in their head. No, people look for action. Does Rambo III have lots of action in it? Sure does. Big explosions? Yep. Mountains of muscle? You betcha. But it isn't entertaining. WHAT? You heard me. It isn't entertaining. WHAT? Please, once was enough. Anyway, yes, it wasn't, isn't and never will be as entertaining as it could and should have been. And though there were tons of explosions, they became a bore after a while. Smart action films with explosions are fun to watch because (a) the explosions and shoot-'em-up action and (b) the plot. Rambo III has no plot - it is a wondering spectacle there for a simple purpose To show lotsa explosions. And show lotsa explosions it does. But they just get tiring. So does watching Sly prancing around like an overfed, overbred, over-steroided ninni in a loin cloth with long, flowing locks of black, greasy hair. Can someone say, Tarzan?This isn't quality action spectacular like Die Hard, this isn't a smart, mean, vicious tale with a sharp focus such as The Terminator - it's just an action flick, and a pretty mind-numbing one at that. I felt like I wanted to fall asleep during this movie, and if that isn't a bad sign, nothing is.The film is there for no reason. The plot, what little of it there is, is just an excuse for explosions, as I said before. We are led to believe that Rambo has been brought back to the battlefield to save an old comrade. But as I watched the film, I gained a sneaky feeling that the only reason Rambo was really returning was because he was getting paid 20 million for this flick. And that ain't a bad racket.

Maybe it's just the comical originality of the plot that made it stand out among 80's comedies for me.  What I truly love about this movie is that it's one where you can sit back and relax without putting any deep concentration into the plot...which can be a breath of fresh air at times.  I tend to be a sucker for this genre if you will.The story starts by introducing us to the main characters, Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard, (Jonathon Silverman) two lovable losers who are tired of being the bottom-feeders of their company.  But after discovering that an employee is embezzling money, they notify their boss, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser).  As a debt of gratitude, he invites them to his weekend beach house on Hampton Island.  But when they arrive, they discover he's dead.  The movie gets more and more hilarious from there on as they spend the weekend pretending that he didn't die.This flick has so many funny moments that I don't know where to begin.  I loved how Larry and Richard tied their shoelaces to Bernie's in order to get him places, and how Larry smashed the champagne bottle over the head of the gardener who he thought was trying to kill him (every man has his breaking point) That's slapstick at it's finest.  Also, I found it hysterical how stupid the people on the island were.  Not one of them ever had a single clue that Lomax was dead even though two guys were carrying him around 24 hours a day. However, my favourite was the rivalry between the deceased Bernie and paranoid mob-hitman Paulie, who, after enjoying the fact the Bernie was dead numerous times, discovered the next moment he was still alive.  Incidentally, it was Bernie who spelled Paulie's downfall in the end.  Funny.This film is not to be taken seriously, and if you take it seriously, you take life too seriously.  It's one of my personal favourites, and the only reason it doesn't get a higher rating is because my reviews do not rely solely on entertainment.

When Dorothy stepped out into Technicolor, I'll bet my eyes just popped.This is the Movie of All Time, folks--a status achieved during its long run as a huge annual TV event during that classic era whose programs now show up on TV Land network.  In the 1970s, Peter Marshall once read the answer on Hollywood Squares as to the program seen more times by more people than anything else ever shown on television.  It was Oz.  Likewise, no movie has the hold on popular culture that this one does.  What lion character ever since (i.e., Snagglepuss) hasn't been an impersonation of Bert Lahr going, Put 'em up, put 'em uuuuup!Few musicals offer an equal combination of lovable music and engaging story. Perhaps The Sound of Music.  Hard to think of many Hollywood musicals where the story gets as serious as it does here when the Witch informs Dorothy that, The last to go will see the first three go before her...and her mangy little dog too!  Yikes!  In contrast, even the best of other Hollywood musicals seem to serve up fluffy, forgettable story lines that are mere backdrop to the song numbers that typically put the plot on hold.I can't say that Oz doesn't have technical flaws or story element inconsistencies.  It's just that the astonishing production values all around so overwhelm the shortcomings.  The tornado sequence is a 1939 special effects tour de force--incredible.  And the Nutcracker-quality musical score offers songs tastefully interwoven with the action.  Certain numbers like Merry Old Land of Oz, I never get tired off, though I like each of the songs.Oz should be viewed in the lightness of spirit that it deserves.  I mean look, we have Frank Morgan as the Emerald City gatekeeper, then seconds later as the cabbie with the Horse of a Different Color, then the Wizard's palace guard, and then the voice of fire-and-smoke Wizard of Oz who bellows, Step forward, Tin Man!  What other film could put an actor go through 4 quick-changes within 10 minutes to such an endearing result?  Oz is as magic as those sparkling ruby shoes.The early Technicolor process utilized triple nitrate negative strips--separately recording each primary color in light.  This was done due to the lack of a suitable color film in 1939.  That would quickly change--but films from years following suffered from hues that faded with the years, even original negatives.  Because Oz was actually filmed on a black-and-white base film, the negatives never faded.  So now we have home videos\/DVDs of breathtaking color quality.  Now, the tinted filters in the cameras that separated the colors onto the negative strips meant that intense illumination was required, rendering the filming experience miserably hot for the actors involved, especially Lahr.  But they all hold up amazingly well.Oz has a valuable message.  As the pop group America once said, No, Oz never did give nothin' to the Tin Man....that he didn't, didn't already have.  If we have truly search, we can find within us--or create through trial, like the Lion's courage--what we think we most lack.  The Wizard (like the Lord) helps those who find help within themselves.I feel sorry for the Almira Gulches who can't treasure this film experience.

The following program is brought to you in living color--with portions in black & white--on NBC. That exclusive intro began my exposure to color television at Grandma's in 1968.  When Dorothy stepped out into Technicolor, I'll bet my eyes just popped.This is the Movie of All Time, folks--a status achieved during its long run as a huge annual TV event during that classic era whose programs now show up on TV Land network.  In the 1970s, Peter Marshall once read the answer on Hollywood Squares as to the program seen more times by more people than anything else ever shown on television.  It was Oz.  Likewise, no movie has the hold on popular culture that this one does.  What lion character ever since (i.e., Snagglepuss) hasn't been an impersonation of Bert Lahr going, Put 'em up, put 'em uuuuup!Few musicals offer an equal combination of lovable music and engaging story. Perhaps The Sound of Music.  Hard to think of many Hollywood musicals where the story gets as serious as it does here when the Witch informs Dorothy that, The last to go will see the first three go before her...and her mangy little dog too!  Yikes!  In contrast, even the best of other Hollywood musicals seem to serve up fluffy, forgettable story lines that are mere backdrop to the song numbers that typically put the plot on hold.I can't say that Oz doesn't have technical flaws or story element inconsistencies.  It's just that the astonishing production values all around so overwhelm the shortcomings.  The tornado sequence is a 1939 special effects tour de force--incredible.  And the Nutcracker-quality musical score offers songs tastefully interwoven with the action.  Certain numbers like Merry Old Land of Oz, I never get tired off, though I like each of the songs.Oz should be viewed in the lightness of spirit that it deserves.  I mean look, we have Frank Morgan as the Emerald City gatekeeper, then seconds later as the cabbie with the Horse of a Different Color, then the Wizard's palace guard, and then the voice of fire-and-smoke Wizard of Oz who bellows, Step forward, Tin Man!  What other film could put an actor go through 4 quick-changes within 10 minutes to such an endearing result?  Oz is as magic as those sparkling ruby shoes.The early Technicolor process utilized triple nitrate negative strips--separately recording each primary color in light.  This was done due to the lack of a suitable color film in 1939.  That would quickly change--but films from years following suffered from hues that faded with the years, even original negatives.  Because Oz was actually filmed on a black-and-white base film, the negatives never faded.  So now we have home videos\/DVDs of breathtaking color quality.  Now, the tinted filters in the cameras that separated the colors onto the negative strips meant that intense illumination was required, rendering the filming experience miserably hot for the actors involved, especially Lahr.  But they all hold up amazingly well.Oz has a valuable message.  As the pop group America once said, No, Oz never did give nothin' to the Tin Man....that he didn't, didn't already have.  If we have truly search, we can find within us--or create through trial, like the Lion's courage--what we think we most lack.  The Wizard (like the Lord) helps those who find help within themselves.I feel sorry for the Almira Gulches who can't treasure this film experience. They need to visit the Emerald City to get their own ticking Testimonials and find their hearts.Didn't bring your broomsticks with you?  Well, I'm afraid you'll have to walk.

They were made when the talkies were still novel and film makers were experimenting with storytelling approaches, often taking inspirations from German Expressionism (indeed 'The Mummy's director Karl Freund, who later directed another 1930s classic 'Mad Love', originally worked as a cinematographer on Fritz Lang's science fiction classic 'Metropolis' and several movies by F.W. Murnau). And it was before the Hayes Code kicked in and took a lot of the fun and thrills out of horror movies (just look at how safe and uninteresting horror became in the 1940s with a few notable exceptions e.g. the movies produced by Val Lewton). The film obviously owes a lot to 'Dracula' and Edward Van Sloan and David Manners from that film reappear here in similar roles. Karloff is brilliant as Imhotep a.k.a The Mummy, and stage actress Zita Johann is wonderful too, very striking with exotic good looks. Too bad she became very quickly disillusioned with Hollywood as she should have been a major screen star. Karloff and Johann are fantastic on screen together, and make 'The Mummy' impossible to forget. I was quite surprised to discover that this movie wasn't enormously successful when originally released, but it has obviously captured the imagination of thousands of film fans since. It is easily the best Mummy movie ever made (though I also have a fondness for Hammer's Blood From The Mummy's Tomb' made almost forty years later), and much more entertaining and intelligent than the awful remake starring Brendan Fraser et al. 'The Mummy' stands alongside 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein', 'Island Of Lost Souls', 'Freaks', 'The Invisible Man' and 'The Black Cat' as one of the best horror movies of the 1930s, an era that has had an enormous impact on horror ever since. Highly recommended! ","genre":null},{"date":"11 August 2003","score":"30 out of 33 people found the following review useful","review":"  I love the classic horror movies of the 1930s.

Stir of Echoes, based on the novel of the same title (save a missing A), came out the same year as The Sixth Sense, and no doubt the reason it did poorly at the box office is because of this fact. But in all truth, this film, though very predictable, has a lot of twists, and I guessed The Sixth Sense's ending long before this'un's. The ending, like many of these films, falls apart a bit and becomes quite average, but then the twists come into play and totally redeem the film.Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is a telephone lineman, living in Chicago with his wife (Kathryn Erbe) and son. The neighborhood he lives in isn't exactly a bad area - everyone knows everyone, everything is out in the open. Or so it seems. Amanda's sister puts Tom into a deep hypnosis one night at a party, just for some fun, and when he snaps out of it he has become a Receiver, one who is open to everything around him. He starts seeing things, flashbacks. One character describes the flashbacks as a flashlight that switches on and off. And as the flashlight continues to flutter, Tom slowly loses his mind.A girl's ghost haunts their home. Tom's son is more of a Receiver than Tom, able to converse with the being and see it constantly. Soon Tom realizes that the ghost is trying to tell them something, trying to get them to do something. But what?Kevin Bacon gives the performance of his career here. I've never seen him channel a character so well - he's even got the gruff Chicago accent down pat. After seeing this film, I still firmly believe that Bacon would be perfect to play a werewolf, as well as Ted Danson. Just look at him - his face is just like a werewolf! Forget Wolf with Jack Nicholson - Bacon and Danson (who I really dislike as an actor) should get together and make Wolfs!, a tale about two werewolfs trying to cut it in the real world. Okay, maybe not, but seriously, he should play a werewolf sometime.The ending to Stir of Echoes didn't really blow me away, I had long guessed it (as always), but there were some small plot twists along the way that made the story much more fun to follow. Such as the feathers element. Trust me, you'll understand what I mean after you see the movie.Regarding the feathers, it took me a moment for it all to register at the end. Unlike a lot of other cheap horror\/thrillers out there, Stir of Echoes does do one thing that seperates it from the ordinary - it gives its audience a chance to be an active audience, not just a lazy, sit-back-and-watch-it-unfold audience.
