They arn't perfect films, but they are entertaining, and that's what movies are supposed to be in the first place.The first thing to do before watching a Batman movie is to throw away most realistic logic. If a movie being illogical and unrealistic angers you, then there is not a Batman movie out there that won't give you a migrane. The fact that the movie takes place in Gotham City, a city that has the look, wardrobe (most of the time), and vehicles of somewhere of inbetween the 1930s to the 1950s yet has the gadgets and technology of tommorrow, should tip you off that this is a fantasy world. Of course the whole billionare who runs around in a bat suit kicking the butt of villans should make you realize it's a fantasy too.The movie in itself is one of the first feature films directed by Tim Burton, and is dark, but it doesn't have the look we really associate with the Tim Burton movies of today. Compare this film with Batman Returns and you'll see what I mean. But Tim went with the notion that Batman is a villain that strikes fear in villains, and sometimes the citizens of Gotham. This is more entertaining than the beloved hero Batman we see in Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.The actors are good. I like Michael Keaton as Batman, which all you really need is a good chin and a gruff voice to pull off, which he does. But I'm not convinced with him as Bruce Wayne, not like he doesn't play Bruce well, he just looks more like a family man than a rich playboy. Jack Nicolson as The Joker was a fine performance, he pulled off being a person who loves to loves to kill in elaborate comical ways. I'd put him as my 2nd favorite Joker, behind Mark Hamill's rendition. Kim Basinger was the only person who got on my nerves...only because she screamed at everything, which got old real fast. The absolute best performance is Michael Gough as Alfred, not like it's the most important role, but he is exactly how I envision Alfred in real life.The plot is something you would easily find out of a comic book, fun and unrealistic, but entertaining all the way. It easily suffices as a path for these characters to interact within Gotham. Other cool features of the movie is the Batmobile, probably the coolest movie car ever, and the wonderful score by Danny Elfman.This film is action packed, full of humor, and fun for all Batman fans. I highly recommend this. ","genre":null},{"date":"16 August 2002","score":"","review":"  The Batman series has always been one of my favorite movie series.

Jim Carrey is perfectly cast as The Riddler and Tommy Lee JOnes is superb as Two-Face, the best villian yet and most over the top performance since Jack Nicleson played The Joker in the first Batman.

I had the videogames based off of it, the McDonald's toys off of it, the action figures from the film, even books and magazines that gave every inch and detail on how every inch and detail of this movie was made. I knew this movie inside and out and loved every frame of this motion picture. Kinda funny that I didn't see it until two years after it was released.I was eight years old at the time and my parents deemed it too dark and gothic for me (I agree, it's too dark for the young kids). But by the time I saw this movie, all two years of anxious, obsessive waiting, it was like seeing the gates of Heaven, and getting a free pass inside. It made me a permanent Batman fan (of course the animated series helped a lot too), a permanent Tim Burton fan, and a permanent fan of any woman who dressed in that Catwoman suit.I don't consider this movie a sequel, because the only connection I can find with the previous Batman live action film, is the references to Vicky Vale, Batman's girl in the first film, and the SWEET Batmobile comes along for the ride. Of course the wonderful Danny Elfman score is still there. Gotham City is vibrant with the twisted vision of Tim Burton, and looks different than the first movie. The Batcave looks different, and Gotham itself looks different. It's like a cross between your dream world and your nightmare.The plot is comic book fun, with the story of The Penguin using the press to elevate his star status, and use the ruse of running for Mayor to plot to take all of Gotham's first born sons with the help of his band of criminal circus rejects. When those plans are foiled, he just releases an army of penguins, from his abandoned zoo hideout, armed with rockets to blow up a huge chunk of Gotham (It's what I'd do if I was a Penguin man). The side story is that of Selena Kyle's transformation into a good girl into The Catwoman an insane tool of vengance and sassy chaos, and Batman who finds a soft spot for her. All of this is flavored with tons of humor that prove the film is having fun with itself, and you should too.DeVito is the only person who I could think of to play a crazy, cranky, horny, disgusting Penguin man. Keaton is an excellent Batman\/Bruce Wayne, even though he still doesn't look the part of Bruce to me. A good pack of people have Princess Leia in a bikini in Return of the Jedi as their favorite moment in a movie with a femme fatale. Well not me, Michelle Phieffer in the black leather (or vinyl or latex, whatever it was) Catwoman suit will forever be the role that made me stand up and say I love women! She was perfect at acting first like a goodie two-shoes, then an insane woman, who runs around part time as a sex-kitten psychopath, bent on killing the man who killed her. And of course Michael Gough returns as the perfect Alfred.This movie to this day is one of my favorite films, and will always be my favorite Batman movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Batman and\/or fun, imaginative movies.
