In my opinion Back to the Future is not only one of the best movies in the genre, it's also in my list of all time favorite movies. When I saw it for the first time, I remember to be blown away by it. But than again, I was only 10 years old, not exactly an age on which you've already seen many really good movies to which you can compare another one. But even now, 20 years after its first release and after I've seen hundreds of movies, I still like it a lot.It's 1985 and Marty McFly is a typical teenager who doesn't like his parents and who has some problems at school. His best friend is Doc Brown, a weird inventor of all kinds of (useless) machines. But this time he has invented something that is much more interesting. He has created a plutonium-powered time machine based on a DeLorean. But when something goes wrong, Marty is accidentally sent back to 1955, the time in which his parents still were young. Not only has he got to adapt to this entirely new environment, he also has to make sure that nothing is changed, because that might have serious consequences for the future...I guess the best reason why this movie works so well and feels so timeless is because they don't use the time machine to go forward. Instead of showing us the future, which wouldn't look exactly like it is right now, they have chosen to go back 30 years, a time period which they new very well and could recreate perfectly. If they hadn't done this, the movie would have felt dated one day and no-one would have liked it because it was far from possible. Another good thing about this movie is the acting. Take for instance Michael J. Fox. Not everything that he has done in his career was very successful, but in this movie he shines. I truly believe that this is one of his best performances ever. The same for Christopher Lloyd. Even though his Dr. Emmett Brown looks like if he could have come out of a cartoon, his acting gives the character something likable and makes you forget about that 'problem'.Overall I really liked this movie a lot. It's one of the finest examples in Sci-Fi movies and I can keep watching it time after time. That's why I believe that this movie doesn't deserve a rating lower than 8\/10.

Also, the cinematography is great--lots of great angles, shots and care. The writing was also very good--the story and dialog were well-crafted.

I just can't imagine Hollywood casting Trevor Howard as a romantic lead! Now, what I didn't like. The basic story is glamorizing extramarital affairs, as the basic plot involves two married people falling for another. I COULD have accepted this is their spouses had been monsters. We don't know about Trevor's, but Celia's husband, though a little dull, loves her dearly and seems like a very decent guy. So this left me thinking much less of Celia as a character--she's looking outside her marriage with little apparent motivation other than possible selfishness. Secondly, although I am sure this film is adored by most women, I venture to guess many guys will be left cold--I know I was. This reminded me of the incredibly over-hyped An Affair To Remember, though Brief Encounter was a generally superior film.It would have been interesting to see how the film would have handled by anyone other than David Lean and Noel Coward. The French would have probably had some nudity and the characters NEVER would have struggled over the indecency of the affair.

It is supposed to be a semi-historical look at a wild, opium-fueled night of hallucinogenic terror with Percy and Mary Shelley, and Lord Byron, and a couple of others, that eventually inspired Mary Shelley to write her iconic novel Frankenstein.

I do remember Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, though, even though it's been 20 years or more since I read it.

I suppose that is the point, since the characters don't know either, but it is very hard to translate to film and still be interesting. (Drug-taking is generally a very individual sort of thing.) And Ken Russel never holds anything back, and he doesn't do so here, either. Most of the actors held up quite well, although it is hard to judge an acting performance when the material is so unusual. Natasha Richardson, Gabriel Byrne, and Myriam Cyr (with whom I am unfamiliar) were all able to make their parts believable, at least as much so as the script allowed. Can't say the same for Julian Sands, though. He always seemed like an actor, and never really inhabited his character. Myriam Cyr had a few nude scenes, but they were all highly un-erotic.

Not only doesn't she have a great relationship with her divorced mother and her younger brother, she is also influenced by the wrong friends who prefer to party and drink all night long, to have sex and use drugs instead of thinking about school and their futures...Perhaps this is the kind of movie that some parents want to show to their kids as a part of their upbringing.

First, kudos to Allen Ball for the script because the writing makes the whole thing possible. The direction by Sam Mendes is also a superb effort and for a first-film he has to thank his lucky stars to have a storyline and cast such as this to work with. This is a story of two people 20 years into a relationship and where their lives are and who they are, compared to what they thought life would turn out to be for them being young and idealistic and not knowing what age, maturity and responsibility would do to alter who they are (or thought they were). Did anyone notice that Angela is the incarnation of the young Carolyn? Smoking pot, speaking freely about sex and just generally enjoying life and all the while trying to convince herself that she is not whom she really is? I believe this is why Lester has such an attraction to her, it is his wife 20 years ago. Lester rediscovered himself, Carolyn refuses to do so. It is so sad to finally discover that material things and projecting a false image becomes more appealing to a person than being brave enough to live life for what it really is. You want a husband?

Still, I'm glad that I finally got to see one and I must say that I'm already a fan of his work. If his other movies are as good as this one, than I almost can't wait to see those too.The title Felicia's Journey already tells something about what to expect from this movie. It tells the story of an Irish girl that is making her way from Ireland to England, to find her boyfriend who moved there to get a job in a lawn-mower factory. On arrival she meets a lonely middle-aged catering manager, called Hilditch, who recommends a boarding room to her. But Hilditch is a bit of a strange man. Even though he seems very nice and polite, he's always alone and seems to spend hours on studying tapes of an eccentric TV chef called Gala. Gradually we learn that the man has a much darker side than what we and Felicia at first assume...Even though he could easily have made a horror movie out of this subject or perhaps even worse, a TV-movie (it has something to do with having a bad youth, murder,...), Atom Egoyan has made the excellent choice of focusing on the drama and studying the characters with flashbacks. And by only slowly allowing the viewer to get some new information, rather than to give away everything at once, he builds up tension very well. But a good story isn't enough to make a good movie of course, some fine performances by all the actors are needed as well. Despite the fact that I didn't really know Elaine Cassidy (I only saw her play in The Others before), I must say that she is a pleasant surprise. She really did a very nice and convincing job with this role. The same can be said about Bob Hoskins. Him I know a lot better, but he too surprised me. He was so good in his role as Hilditch, that it took me quite some time to believe that it was really this man who did those horrible things.Overall this is a very fine movie with some excellent performances and a very interesting story.

The Martin Thiel character, played to dizzy, frightening reality by Bacon, is chilling, to say the least.The courtroom scenes were excellently written and performed. Oldman, as Ben Chase, acts at a high level as he brings his character through the torturous conflict between his professional ethics and his own humanity. Without, I might add, any British accent showing through, but with a clearly intentional Irish brogue when his blood is up. Nice work, that.Mark Kasdan--author of Silverado and brother of writer\/director\/producer Lawrence Kasdan--writes a spare story with immediate suspense. He neatly puts attorney and client in a cat-and-mouse game, where Chase's silence, or betrayal, are equally dangerous for him, and for his love interest, Ellen, played well by Karen Young (Heat, 9-1\/2 Weeks).Elizabeth Shepherd plays the icy mother to perfection. Her blind devotion to her son, along with the absence of any physical display of emotion, are together at the root of the Thiel family dysfunction. This interpersonal rift makes the Martin Thiel character appear stiff and creepy and adds to the confusion and suspense of his innocence or guilt in the string of grisly sex murders that pepper this film.The use of fire and rain throughout also enrages the imagination and adds clearly to the loathing an animal fear in Criminal Law. It is easy for the viewer to feel stalked or hunted in these parts of the movie--deliciously!Tess Harper and Joe Don Baker have critical but minor roles, and do nothing to spoil the suspense of it.

But this time the premise is extremely worn out and the wisecracks are very tired and sometimes downright stupid.It started so promising. When Fletch finds out that he has inherited an estate in the deep south from an aunt he hardly knew, we get a wicked satire of Song of the South, complete with animation and a singing Chevy. When the scenery changes from L.A. to Lousiana we get every southern stereotype known to man. The Klan is apparently back in action and tries to get Fletch to leave the estate which turns out to be not what it's cracked up to be. We also get southern beauties who present themselves with three names like Amanda Ray Ross and Becky Ann Culpepper and you just know that the first thing Fletch does is make a rather suggestive remark that the women find irresistible and they immediately jump in the sack with him. The Amanda Ray character is not so lively the next morning and looks sort of like she was in the deep freeze for the entire night. Can this be a comment on Fletch's abilities in the sack or is there foul play involved. If you think it is the second answer you are absolutely right.So next we meet a lawyer who seems to wanna help Fletch (do they do that?) and we also meet a ranch hand who serves as Fletch's only friend among hostile citizens. An amusing, but not quite funny bit involves a TV evangelist played by the great R. Lee Ermey but he doesn't seem sleazy enough to generate much suspicion towards him so the real culprit must be the most unlikely. Have I given too much away? Doesn't matter. The plot is not why we go to see this movie but the laughs are not there this time. A shame since I was looking forward to seeing this. You can only hope that there won't be another sequel.

I don't know if someone has ever done some research about the link between crime and hot weather, but I wouldn't be surprised if there is one. The fact that it is used in this movie proves nothing of course, but it's an idea that Lawrence Kasdan, the writer as well director of this movie, has used and developed very well in this film.Ned Racine is a dubious lawyer in a small town in Florida who suffers from the heat wave that has covered the entire state. On one evening he meets the married Matty Walker and it doesn't take long before the two start a steaming affair. But there is only one thing that stands between them and eternal happiness. Matty's rich husband Edmund is a problem that needs to be taken care of. They start planning his death, but the question if they will get away with it remains. One thing is for sure, they should never get too greedy by wanting all his money...With William Hurt, Kathleen Turner, Ted Danson and Mickey Rourke I must say that Lawrence Kasdan certainly had a nose for young talent. None of them was famous yet, but they all have worked on a nice career since. The only veteran actor that he casted for this movie was Richard Crenna, so in a way I must say that this was a great gamble. But it worked and that's all that really matters. But I'm sure that it wouldn't all have been that nice if it hadn't been for the interesting story. I don't know if Kasdan is a fan of the film noire, but this entire movie sure feels like one.I guess it's thanks to the many talents of Lawrence Kasdan that this movie has become such a nice debut for him. He worked with some nice actors, but gave them an interesting script to work with in the first place. Add to this some good, perhaps a bit classic, directing and you get a movie like this one.

Apparently some things went wrong with the distribution and the dark content of the movie was probably not what they were used to see at that time either. Does that mean that it is a bad movie? Far from it, the story for instance is multi-layered, interesting and quite impressive.It all starts with a young American woman who is brought to a hospital in Vienna after a suicide attempt by overdosing on pills. But the police detective that investigates the case suspects that there is more going on than what her lover, an American psychology professor, wants to admit. As the doctors do everything possible to save the woman's life, the professor is thoroughly interrogated by the detective. Through a series of flashbacks, we see how the relationship between the two started and evolved and what that had to do with the suicide attempt. Everything will be shown their passionate sexual relationship, her drinking problem, the numerous affairs that both have, her hidden marriage...As I already said, this is a multi-layered story. For me, that makes this movie only more interesting, but I have the feeling that not that many people can cope with it, as today we are only used to see straight and easy stories which don't demand too much of our brains. This movie combines all kinds of aspects like espionage during the Cold War, romance, thriller, drama,... but always feels like one solid film. That only proves the skills of the director and the screenwriter of course. It was the first time that I saw a movie from the hand of director Nicolas Roeg and Yale Udoff is a complete stranger to me as well. But together they made the entire story work.The fact that this is such a solid movie also has a lot to do with the good acting.

It's too bad that it isn't better known, because it certainly deserves to be seen by a much larger audience. I give this movie at least a 7.5\/10, maybe even an 8\/10.
