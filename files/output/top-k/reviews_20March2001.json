I did this, and I hate to admit that I was disappointed by a movie that so many people seem to love so much. Almost from the very beginning of the movie, I wasn't sure if I was watching a drama or a broad physical comedy, and this is a main beef I have with many of these 70's films. Too many of them would mix dramatics with humor in a way that is not satisfying to me. The story is very rambling until the Hansons arrive and I hungered to see them do funny things like beat people up in creative ways, but that is a long ways in the coming after their introduction. Paul Newman sees the Boys playing with their slot cars and comments that they brought their TOYS with them! on the road trip. This is funny and should have been explored more, but it isn't. As a matter of fact, the Hanson's and their background are not explored at all, and they have a small amount of total screen time. This is too bad because they are the best part of the movie. Paul Newman is a great actor and he plays a well-worn old player who is on the slide down in his career just as the steel town they play in is on a slide down with everyone becoming laid-off. But if you are like me and want to see cool hockey footage of guys playing without helmets, wacky stuff happening at the rink, the Hanson brothers doing their thing, etc. , there just isn't enough of it there. If this movie was made today, there would be less social commentary, less human interest, more Hansons, and more hockey. And, sadly, it would probably be a better movie because of it. See it so you know what it is to put on the foil , Coach, and so your friends don't slap their foreheads when you say you haven't seen it.

This weekend after my long over due shave, I ran to the 945 showing of Enemy at the Gate and, from the credits on I was blown away. I'm convinced that this movie was made by someone who not only is a very sensitive artist but a gifted filmmaker, no hack could ever pull this film off, is impossible. This film not only has a very specific opinion about war, but about the ties made and responsibilities taken. My first impression of the movie, and those of you who saw it I'm talking about the boat scene, it was going to be a plain testosterone ride but, I was way wrong. This movie hates war, hates war just as much as the Nazis, the Russians and just the whole thing, that's why is great and remarkable. All the characters have a sense off responsibilities but at the same time an even bigger sense of doom, after all they are in the middle of a war, and as stated it's the worst place to be. The fact that is by all means a sniper movie the characters were not what you would see through the view finder of a rifle, the are well crafted individuals who want to not only help the Motherland but get themselves out of this situation. Every character has it's remorse and dreams even if they are not stated they are there, not underwritten, just written by the acting, which is to say the least, superb. Every single shot fired was frightening to me, not only because of the moral consequences but because of the toll it was taken on the characters, for every Nazi a Russian will die. And now to the part I loved the most, in the middle of the awful war of guns, a love story brews. The great thing about the love story is that him and her were in love with the situation not the person. She was in love with the legend that he was and he was just in love with the pretty girl who likes the man everyone thinks he is, perfection. During the sex scene everyone in the theater was laughing. I know why, when you watch that scene without thinking about what i just stated the sex may seem impossible, why would they fall in love with each other you just met 30 minutes ago, well is simple escapism. They are escaping the war by running into each other. And off course the twist that makes the love story complete is that the man who truly knows her and the way she is, his love is not returned. Sad but the base for a great story, where the biggest conflict is surviving this war. Without a doubt, in my top list of greatest war films ever,  also in the list Full Metal Jacket, Paths of Glory, Bridge on the River Kwai.I saw other movies this week end but fact is I don't remember them.

His talent is unquestionable. There are so many hilarious moments in this movie. Let me see some of them Jerry Springer Show(My Dad is evil and wants to take over the world), The tent scene, The fight of the century Austin Vs. Mini-Me(Poor little), Scott Evil's complaints(Why don't you just kill them?), Will Mustafa Ferrel, etc, etc, etc, ...  )The fantastic soundtrack(Lenny Kravitz, Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharad, R.E.M., Quincy Soul Bossa Nova Jones, Green Day, Mrs. Madonna and many others) really transports us from the agitate nineties to the delicious sixties. And how wonderful are Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Kristen Johnston and Gia Carides! Talking about woman I prefer the goddess Liz Hurley but Heather Graham is perfect as Powers-Girl.For those guys who didn't like this masterpiece of enjoyment I'm going to say only one thing YOU DON'T HAVE SENSE OF HUMOR I THINK YOU'VE LOST YOUR MOJOS!.For the guys who loved AP2 LET'S WAIT FOR THE NEXT AUSTIN POWERS' SHAGADELIC ADVENTURE!For the babes OHH BEHAVE!!!!!!!10\/10 ***** Best of genre ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"20 March 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  It's hard for me to react to this movie on the base level of like or dislike. I feel that this movie challenged me. It was like watching nine movies at once, all at once, all of them all coming together and occurring at once and it gave me such a headache that I had to get drunk afterwards to get rid of the mental strain; which I don't think implies that I'm stupid, trying to comprehend all that went on, simply that either of two things occurred 1.) It was too dark and I watched a movie on a tv screen for 3 hours, giving me a headache, or 2.)There was so much going on my head was buckling from all of the things happening. I've now seen this movie twice and still am unable to fully have seen everything inside it. At the beginning its tricky because it has a very slow, welcoming, but fast and engaging beginning that pulls you in. From there we get a nice rounded bunch of pieces of viginettes that draw us into the characters, some more interesting than others (I personally liked the John C. Reilly cop the best). But from then on the movie is basically hours of these events colliding together, all happening at once, and at first when I saw it I thought maybe it was just overdone and the reason I didn't simply get a normal like\/dislike reaction was because it maybe wasn't done so well, but now I'm starting to think that it was just so densely packed with information and things happening that I just was in over my head. This 2nd time I found myself drawn into things I wasn't as drawn into before, but only maybe 20-30 percent moreso than the first viewing. Maybe it'll take another 6 viewings before I find myself interested in some of the side characters without alot of development (such as the Julianne Moore character, who I found simply not interesting at all). There are some characters I wanted to spend time with more than others, especially the cop and the girl he found, as well as the Tom Cruise character (to some degree), and the Phillip Baker Hall character. There are times when I wish this movie took off in a few of the directions suggested by the multiple plotlines or ideas of plotlines raised in its unfolding, but since I found myself more interested than the first viewing I am going to keep watching this movie and hopefully find myself even more into things I wasn't as into the first or second time. I think that what P.T. Anderson has done is a movie that I haven't really seen before- something so dense and challenging, something that goes against most of what I've spent the majority of my life watching, movies that really pick one straight line and stay with it; you get involved in that line but really its just one line, whereas this movie is made up of so much that you're forced with the idea that there is more to this movie than you think, and that maybe its not the movie that's not doing its job but YOU, that for once you are challenged to re-watch this movie to explore it further, because there's so much to it. Now how many  times has THAT happened to you as a moviegoer these days, especially to one from my generation (I'm nearly 20)?????
