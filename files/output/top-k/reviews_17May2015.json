[{"date":"17 May 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Lola (Franka Potente) receives a phone call from her boyfriend Manni. When she fails to show up to pick him up, he had to take the subway. He leaves behind 100k DM in a bag on the train when the cops show up. A vagrant picks it up. Manni has only 20 minutes before bad guy Ronnie expects the money. Manni has the idea to rob a store but Lola begs him to wait. Lola goes on a run to get the money first from her father. It doesn't turn out well. The story restarts and she goes on a second run to her father. Then she goes on a third.The premise is interesting but problematic. It has the cleverness of Groundhog Day but I don't like the third run. There are changes in the third run that doesn't make sense. Why couldn't she get to her father when she got to him the first two times? Why would the vagrant run into the bike rider? The vagrant is at the wrong place. The changes don't seem to be valid. I do like the kinetic energy of the movie. I like the visual style. I also like how the people's futures are revealed like fun little vignettes. Also Franka Potente has a great star quality. She is able to sell this premise.

Instead he falls for the enticing entertainer. He resigns from the school to marry Lola. His limited savings are wasted and he's forced to perform as the clown. His dignity is lost. He grows jealous. He is ridiculed by everybody as he becomes a pathetic shadow of what he once was.It's one of the first sound German movies. It's most notable for introducing Marlene Dietrich to the world. She catches the attention of the modern world and would become an international star. Lola is an icon of uninhibited sexuality. This is a little slow compared to modern movies in spots around the middle after Rath's decline sets in. His destruction is inevitable. It is still compelling and Dietrich is magnetic.
