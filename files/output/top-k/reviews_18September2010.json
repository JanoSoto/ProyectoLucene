It has its flaws and its not up to the standard of Fincher's Se7en or Fight club. The script is the big flaw, the story is pretty thin and simple. It just starts and you don't really get much of an background, I guess it not really necessary but even later the story is weak in giving any explanation to some of the events. A couple of thinks I feel doesn't make complete sense, maybe some plot holes but it doesn't bother me. However the script also lack in the description of the characters but the film is saved in that department thanks to the always great Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker, its also fun to see the young Kristen Stewart who is also really good. The bad guys feel weak, not frightening. Forest Whitaker manages to give his character a bit of substance but the others are just blank. However the film still succeeds in delivering an positive experience thank to other aspects. Fincher is great at creating suspense and that is what lifts this. The dark tone works really well and certain parts takes one to the edge of the seat. The action is well considered to not take away the suspense, and also very nice-looking, unrealistic at one time but not a problem.

He never has really been a great actor but he is sometimes pretty funny and that's what happened here. Tolerable performance, funny lines. Sometimes he does good and has actually funny and well done lines like in Life, other times he is not funny and just annoying, like in Black Knight. Dave Chappelle was definitely the highlight of the film. He is hilarious in almost every one of his scenes, making me wish he was in it more.

It is a children's movie distributed by Miramax, who has made dozens of Oscar-winning films over the last 30 years. It has special effects by Cinemagic and the Jim Henson Creature Shop, and Jack Black stars in it. You would want to see it, right? Well, not if it's The NeverEnding Story III.The NeverEnding Story III is disappointing in every sense of the word. It is by far one of the worst sequels ever made, and it does a disservice to the book by Michael Ende and the original 1984 film on which it is based (My review http\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0088323\/usercomments-250).This movie takes characters from the book and creates a new story that is full of plot holes, bad puns, and very little logic whatsoever. It helps very little that none of the cast members from either of the first two movies were involved in this film.This time, Bastian is played by Jason James Richter (Free Willy (1993)). Although Richter looks like a preteen model, he is still harassed by a gang at his new school known as the Nasties (or the Nastys) whose leader is Slip, played by a then-unknown Jack Black.As it turns out, Bastian's new school also happens to be where Coreander, the owner of the book store in the original story, works as a librarian. British actor Freddie Jones plays Coreander in this movie, and fans of the original may be disappointed not to see Thomas Hill reprise his role. I don't blame them.Anyway, Coreander happened to bring the NeverEnding Story with him to this school library. It's a pretty contrived way to bring the book back into the story after the main character has moved away if you ask me.What's even more contrived is when Bastian, hiding from the Nastys, retreats into the world of Fantasia, only to have Slip retrieve the book, realize its powers, and try to destroy the world and Bastian. In the book and the first two movies, the reader had little to no control over how the NeverEnding Story would be told. How the Nastys get control is never explained anywhere in the movie. The NeverEnding Story being an enchanted book is no excuse to cover up such plot holes.When Bastian realizes he has to re-enter the real world to obtain the book and save Fantasia, the movie just gets worse. Even with the Oren (the token worn around the neck that resembles two snakes), Bastian alone can't make it back home. So a number of creatures from Fantasia have to wish with him, and be transported into his world, for him to save Fantasia.Such a subplot wouldn't be so bad if the supporting characters weren't so annoying and intelligence insulting. There's the Rock-Biter's baby boy who talks in annoying baby talk that real children under 3 don't use as vernacular, an anthropomorphic tree who talks like an old Jewish comedian except not as funny, and two gnomes (Urgl and Engywook, featured in the first movie but played by different actors) who have a tired running joke about needing to use the bathroom.Oh yes, and who could forget Falcor, the luck dragon? In the first two movies, Falcor was a hero to Atreyu and Bastian, and was the voice of reason in many situations. He also had a voice like Walter Cronkite, which made him ever cooler. Here, he not only looks different from the previous two films, but he's whinier and dumber. When, in the real world, he mistakes an airplane for a female luck dragon, I could only hang my head and wonder, Why?.To make matters worse, Bastian can't wish the book back after the Nastys stole it because he can't use the Oren to make wishes in the real world. That plot point is well and good, and makes a setup for a great conflict that adds to the story. Unfortunately, the people who wrote this screenplay forget that plot point and failed to explain why Bastian's stepsister Nicole (Melody Kay) could make wishes when she had possession of the Oren. Any script reviser could point out these plot holes, and it most especially amazes me that filming progressed despite these inconsistencies.It is even more amazing that no one in this movie actually acts poorly. Richter does well in his role, despite his voice obviously cracking and no one noticing. I don't bring that point up to be mean. It's just that the filmmakers could have used his voice changing as a good subplot to explain why he's being picked on. But I digress.The point is that everyone involved in this film just could not save the story having so many inconsistencies. By the end, the story bears no resemblance to Ende's original book at all. The Fantasia creatures are also too annoying, trying too hard to be comic relief and inundating their dialogue with uncharacteristic pop culture references. Case in point the Rock Biter rides his bike while singing Born To Be Wild by Steppenwolf. What were these filmmakers thinking?And you would think that the Jim Henson Creature Shop working on your side would be a valuable asset in this film. In this case, none of the recurring characters look like they did in the first two movies (the Rock Biter, looking like a pint-size version of his predecessor, was the biggest disappointment), and they weren't strong characters either. They did not live up to Henson's high standards of storytelling and development. If you don't believe me, try finding this movie on Muppet Central. You would have had better luck finding this film in a theater that ran it for two weeks back when it was released.

There's the Rock-Biter's baby boy who talks in annoying baby talk that real children under 3 don't use as vernacular, an anthropomorphic tree who talks like an old Jewish comedian except not as funny, and two gnomes (Urgl and Engywook, featured in the first movie but played by different actors) who have a tired running joke about needing to use the bathroom.Oh yes, and who could forget Falcor, the luck dragon? In the first two movies, Falcor was a hero to Atreyu and Bastian, and was the voice of reason in many situations. He also had a voice like Walter Cronkite, which made him ever cooler. Here, he not only looks different from the previous two films, but he's whinier and dumber. When, in the real world, he mistakes an airplane for a female luck dragon, I could only hang my head and wonder, Why?.To make matters worse, Bastian can't wish the book back after the Nastys stole it because he can't use the Oren to make wishes in the real world. That plot point is well and good, and makes a setup for a great conflict that adds to the story. Unfortunately, the people who wrote this screenplay forget that plot point and failed to explain why Bastian's stepsister Nicole (Melody Kay) could make wishes when she had possession of the Oren. Any script reviser could point out these plot holes, and it most especially amazes me that filming progressed despite these inconsistencies.It is even more amazing that no one in this movie actually acts poorly. Richter does well in his role, despite his voice obviously cracking and no one noticing. I don't bring that point up to be mean. It's just that the filmmakers could have used his voice changing as a good subplot to explain why he's being picked on. But I digress.The point is that everyone involved in this film just could not save the story having so many inconsistencies. By the end, the story bears no resemblance to Ende's original book at all. The Fantasia creatures are also too annoying, trying too hard to be comic relief and inundating their dialogue with uncharacteristic pop culture references. Case in point the Rock Biter rides his bike while singing Born To Be Wild by Steppenwolf. What were these filmmakers thinking?And you would think that the Jim Henson Creature Shop working on your side would be a valuable asset in this film. In this case, none of the recurring characters look like they did in the first two movies (the Rock Biter, looking like a pint-size version of his predecessor, was the biggest disappointment), and they weren't strong characters either. They did not live up to Henson's high standards of storytelling and development. If you don't believe me, try finding this movie on Muppet Central. You would have had better luck finding this film in a theater that ran it for two weeks back when it was released.

It is a children's movie distributed by Miramax, who has made dozens of Oscar-winning films over the last 30 years. It has special effects by Cinemagic and the Jim Henson Creature Shop, and Jack Black stars in it. You would want to see it, right? Well, not if it's The NeverEnding Story III.The NeverEnding Story III is disappointing in every sense of the word. It is by far one of the worst sequels ever made, and it does a disservice to the book by Michael Ende and the original 1984 film on which it is based (My review http\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0088323\/usercomments-250).This movie takes characters from the book and creates a new story that is full of plot holes, bad puns, and very little logic whatsoever. It helps very little that none of the cast members from either of the first two movies were involved in this film.This time, Bastian is played by Jason James Richter (Free Willy (1993)). Although Richter looks like a preteen model, he is still harassed by a gang at his new school known as the Nasties (or the Nastys) whose leader is Slip, played by a then-unknown Jack Black.As it turns out, Bastian's new school also happens to be where Coreander, the owner of the book store in the original story, works as a librarian. British actor Freddie Jones plays Coreander in this movie, and fans of the original may be disappointed not to see Thomas Hill reprise his role. I don't blame them.Anyway, Coreander happened to bring the NeverEnding Story with him to this school library. It's a pretty contrived way to bring the book back into the story after the main character has moved away if you ask me.What's even more contrived is when Bastian, hiding from the Nastys, retreats into the world of Fantasia, only to have Slip retrieve the book, realize its powers, and try to destroy the world and Bastian. In the book and the first two movies, the reader had little to no control over how the NeverEnding Story would be told. How the Nastys get control is never explained anywhere in the movie. The NeverEnding Story being an enchanted book is no excuse to cover up such plot holes.When Bastian realizes he has to re-enter the real world to obtain the book and save Fantasia, the movie just gets worse. Even with the Oren (the token worn around the neck that resembles two snakes), Bastian alone can't make it back home. So a number of creatures from Fantasia have to wish with him, and be transported into his world, for him to save Fantasia.Such a subplot wouldn't be so bad if the supporting characters weren't so annoying and intelligence insulting.

At first I thought it was going to be this cheesy movie where a boy is in a fantasy world and he learns an easy lesson from this book and applies it in real life. However this went deeper than i thought. But before that let me say the cons first. First of all, there were a couple of scenes that didn't make sense at all. For example, when the horse drowns because the horse lost against sadness, he became sad but he didn't drown. Also I didn't like the ending where he comes to the real world and takes revenge (it was kinda childish). But what I like about this movie is that it went deeper than what i thought it will. I especially like the part where he talks to the wolf. I am the servant of nothing because when people lose their hope, it's easy to control them That is so true because when Germany lost their hope, they voted for Hitler because he promised everything.

And then, after a long time, you find this marvelous film MEN IN BLACK, the title purposely without significance, so that nobody gets suspicious of its content. After having watched this movie, you, who understands, recognize that the crew who made this movie is obviously the last rest of people who could rescue themselves when their relatives had been high-jacked and replaced by the aliens. Working in the underground, they used the genre of comedy, again, in order to avoid suspects, because the low lives' Gestapo is everywhere! Even worse In the film they abuse the Mexican minority in the southern rim of the US for suspect of being aliens, for example in the famous truck-scene where the two MIB search the trunk and find these aliens disguised as Mexicans. So, the message of this movie is clear enough The few Mexicans in the trunk are the real Americans, while the majority around, the alleged Americans, are the aliens. IF SOMEONE INVITES YOU TO THE US, STAY AWAY, RUN AWAY AND HIDE YOURSELF.

The first is an eerie passage of play consisting of strange mummified figures sporting pained faces and accompanied by odd orchestral music; a series of tracking shots followed by a bat swooping down from the top of the frame in dogged slow motion and set up, it seems, so as to resemble a bird of prey swooping down on its mark. The victimised expressions on the mummified, cave based remains followed by a semiotical sense of something of great power coming down on top of something it has the ability to snare is effectively put across in the opening, something that is jarring but exists for more than just petty cinematic frills so as to grab a viewer's attention. That being because the sequence echoes what the film will go on to revolve around, that being a small and scraggly little man with a goal that resembles the coming down on top of an item he hopes to victimise and cause enough terror so that those on the wrong end of his wrath will see fit to bear similar expressions to that of the remains at the beginning. The second sequence sees Herzog distract us from this foreshadowing with a cutting away of this terrifying sequence in an extremed manner; seeing fit to secondly provide an angelic and uplifting montage of puppies and all things much nicer to more choral music.The eventual catalyst for Klaus Kinski's Count Dracula, and his moving away from the safe but un-Earthly confines of his large and secluded castle in Werner Herzog's re-imagining of the classic 1920s film, began with the visit of what was essentially an estate agent there to meet with the Count about the proposed purchasing of new properties. But it is a different reason altogether, albeit because of said estate agent that sees him veer off, and that is his observing and consequent lust to seek out a certain Lucy Harker (Adjani), the wife of the estate agent, of whom he notices by way of a photograph which eventually pushes him over the precipice of wanting to venture out into the dangerous unknown. The wider world is a hazard to him only because he is a demon of the night, a vampire whom is aware it is impossible to expose oneself to daylight through risk of death. Despite this weakness, and the distinct vulnerability you'd think the Count faces because of it, the film manages to maintain a surprising amount of threat born out of his mere presence, anyway.The aforementioned estate agent is a certain Jonathan Harker (Ganz), a man charged with venturing long and high over the hills so as to meet with Dracula. Herzog constructs his journey and findings as if a short film within the overall spectrum of the feature, the discovering of a rest stop in the form of a tavern seeing him and his horse greeted by an array of locals whom react to him in a manner that suggests they do not especially receive the company of many people from out of town. We feel, through how the locals react and in a more visual sense in Harker's attire when compared to that of the locals, that he is both a little out of his depth and beyond some kind of respective void. As the trip to Dracula's castle nears and this sense of alienation in his surroundings becomes more prominent, the film effectively instills degrees of fear and doubt as to whether what he's doing is a good idea.As Jon arrives at his destination, we're greeted by a chorus of triumphant and welcoming bursts of music while the man himself is greeted by an elderly, frail and bedraggled little person whom we're immediately at unease with. His hospitality is kind and gentle, his later goals anything but and after a plethora of long shots encompassing magnificent hills, skies and vast rural locales as Harker travelled to this place, we are now effectively confined to small and enclosed spaces in the corners of this deathly quiet stone palace as evening meals play out in awkward, border line twisted, silence. As a sordid relationship consisting of a host and their guest plays out to a climax, a climax of which the new order sees Dracula attempt to journey all the way back so as to track down Lucy, the shift in focus so as to zero in on those in the town of Wismar where Lucy is based and Jonathan's race against time so as to warn them takes over. Here, Lucy adopts more of a prominent role in the film; Herzog transforming her from the casual housewife patiently waiting back home for her husband to return once he's finished business, and into a more involved character whose actions see her placed on the front-line at the coming of Dracula. Where years of popular culture and prior knowledge of other texts dealing with either this story or genre specificities, Herzog has crafted a stand alone film which is dramatic; ominous and tension filled. This is an effective, and mostly affecting, piece which shifts gears and changes direction so as to forge an engaging narrative with decent attention to its characters somewhat beautifully, and is recommended.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"18 September 2010","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" If we hope to be educated by film, Mountains of the Moon shows us why that's a slippery slope. Bob Rafelson wanted to make this film for years but he takes liberties about key things, so that means he was looking to tell a very specific story about two people, rather than evoke something of the reality of European exploration in Africa. This is romantic, classical, storytelling. For exampleSpeke is shown to hesitate when he returns to England before he goes before the Royal Geographical Society, no doubt to show him as a pawn used by his publishers who hope to make a fortune on his findings. In reality Speke hastened back to England.In the end we're told that Speke's theory that Lake Victoria is the source of the river Nile is correct. In reality, the White Nile flows out of a system of lakes in the region, which would mean that Richard Burton's theory was correct. But Speke's betrayal of his friend in the film is so alienating for his character, that his committing suicide is not atonement enough. The film also feels the need to vindicate his theory post mortem.What this means is that Mountains of the Moon takes liberties with fact, but does so in the interest of likable, well-rounded, characters. A lot of the drama is riveting. There's good and bad in them and Speke is not allowed to become the villain. That reveals Bob Rafelson's method here; there's too much 'film' in Mountains of the Moon. Africa is a central character in the same inescapable way the desert is prominent in Lawrence of Arabia, it shapes and moulds the people and spits them back out in Victorian England scarred and tattered, but this story of loyalty, friendship, and betrayal, almost takes place apart from Africa. Rafelson doesn't have the affinity for the mysteries of a new world, at once horrible and wonderful, the capacity to be at awe, as Herzog in his jungle films or Coppola in Apocalypse Now. The landscape is there but Rafelson doesn't quite know what to do with it. He shoots it like it's a studio backlot. The African desert is there but it doesn't have a presence. When the expedition sets off for the interior of Africa, we get bouncy 'adventure' music in upbeat tempos.Then we're taken captives by a local chieftain and the movie takes a turn towards something that reminds me of Cobra Verde, where Klaus Kinski suffers a similar fate off the West African coast, and Cabeza de Vacas, where the sole survivor of a conquistador expedition is held by Mexican indians, elaborate rituals and peculiar ceremonies introduce us to a strange world where ornate violence is at the heart of everything. Rafelson is still doing a movie in the classical sense of the term though, and for that movie little has changed since the 60's when British colonial interests in the area where again depicted in the historical epic Khartoum.If Terrence Malick is filled with lyrical wonder at everything around him in his tale of the settlement of New England in The New World, Bob Rafelson is the complete opposite, he's too banal about the Nile expedition in Mountains of the Moon.

It's not new. It's just not bad. In the 1950s, the earliest era I remember, there was a crusade against rock and roll, said to be corrupting the morals of our otherwise pristine youngsters. On the Ed Sullivan Show, Elvis Presley was only photographed from the waist up because, it was thought, he did suggestive bumps below his belt. To be sure, Presley argued, I don't make no dirty body movements. A decade later, there were sex and drugs added to the rock and roll. Oh, and long hair. But none of that was particularly new either. Here's a complaint by Socrates from Plato's Republic.I mean such things as these when the young are to be silent before their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and making them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes are to be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners in general. You would agree with me? Yes.The teen agers we see in River's Edge aren't really rebelling against anything. They're not like James Dean or Marlon Brando. They don't have anything to rebel against -- no poverty, no restrictive environment, no lack of material goods, no mean teachers, no oppressive moral structure -- just boredom and a lack of guidelines. Well, that's what anomi IS. The absence of guidelines. And it can be very stressful, like driving across the huge parking lot of a shopping mall, only all the yellow lines and arrows on the pavement are missing. It can drive anyone nuts. Daniel Roebuck, a plump and rather disturbed high school kid, has strangled his girl friend and left her naked body on the bank of the local river. He tells his friends. At first they don't believe him but then they investigate and find the remains, now pale with death and being visited by the occasional insect. Nobody knows what to do. They all knew poor Jennifer. They're all upset but more puzzled than anything else. I mean, why did John kill her? Should we inform the police? That's squealing on a friend, isn't it?The movie meanders around along with the handful of students that it aims to keep track of. The dead naked body doesn't exactly fade from their consciousness but its priority drops a few notches. They drink beer, smoke dope, get laid. The kid who is most worried is Crispin Glover. His aim is to protect the murderer, maybe get him out of town, if he can scrape together a car and enough money for gas. Glover overacts outlandishly.

He waves his hands like a lunatic and his face is hawklike and red lipped, resembling Dracula possess by a dybbuk.The two prettiest kids are Keanu Reeves, who's no more than adequate, and Ione Skye, who is beautiful but as airheaded as the others. The most bizarre character is Dennis Hopper (who else?), the ex biker with the wooden leg and the plastic sex doll he carts around with him wherever he goes. Sometimes he dances with it. It's name is Elsie. He shoots someone else, it seems, partly because that someone else was using Elsie for the purpose for which she was designed and Hopper got jealous. The final scene is at Jennifer's open-casket funeral. She looks like a virgin, all in white lace, pure as a patient etherized upon a table. The camera gives us a glimpse of the frieze above the altar, a flamboyant pink Jesus surrounded by clouds and cherubim.

You see her character very convincingly age during the movie and you see her love and frustration with Flynt. Just a great performance which was totally ignored at the Academy Awards.

It was well-directed by Milos Forman and shows the decades it takes place in very well. (There's fantastic use of the 1970s song Dream Weaver) It's just a little bit overlong.

Dirty Harry was an engagingly tight-lipped character and the film was gorgeously shot in a gorgeous location, a right-wing wet dream. And, man, his gun was big.Dirty Harry and his gun soldier on, but this is craftsmanship without heart. It's no longer original, and it's done as if by numbers.Harry Callahan now works for Lt. Briggs (Holbrook) in homicide, and has a friend who is bent so far he's just about to break (Mitch Ryan). Four rookie traffic cops who carry .357 magnums can evidently outshoot Harry (!). And Harry gets a proposition from a friend's wife, which he turns down, and an enthusiastic proposal from a pretty Japanese neighbor, which he doesn't. His partner from the first film, Chico, is now teaching college and Harry is burdened with another minority partner, the African-American Felton Perry, who is there chiefly so that Harry can tell him (that is, the audience) about what's going on. He does not survive. The reason Felton Perry must be blown apart with a stick of celery in his mouth is that it's been decreed that the body count must be kept high.There are only two points worth making. One is that Dirty Harry was nailed by critics and by the public (who attended in droves) for being a Fascist fantasy, which it was. So now Harry must redeem himself by upholding the jurisprudential system in the face of an assault by an internal death squad that is intent on killing all the evildoers in San Francisco. The movie is a jab to the jaw of liberal critics.The second point is that there is no longer any poetry is this carefully constructed and successful piece of junk. The movie knows precisely where it wants to go and it gets there efficiently and without imagination.One of the more celebrated aspects of the original film was Harry's .44 magnum. Everyone was thrilled by that huge cannon Harry carted about. Therefore -- knowing this -- the film's credits roll over a static shot of a monster magnum being held against a blood-red background. The shot of the fist holding the gun seems to go on forever. Maybe it will. But -- no! As the credits end, the fist twists the barrel of the cannon towards the audience -- and SHOOTS.Well, what are we to make of this? We -- the audience, guilty of nothing more than stealing an occasional ash tray from a fancy Las Vegas motel? Or a towel from the beach at Waikiki? Oh, maybe a little cheating on our income tax return, but everyone does that. And the closet full of pantyhose is nothing more than a hobby, a collection, rather like a stamp collection except a bit more, well, exciting.What we are obviously supposed to make of that opening is that the folks who are bringing you this Grand Guignol don't care whether you're guilty of anything or not. They know you've come to the theater to see Harry wield his big gun, and they give it to you -- in your face.In case that opening isn't enough, Ted Post, the director, gives you three shots of men loading their revolvers with the camera at ground level and the guns being held barrel-downward, pointing towards the lens.One of the things I gave Dirty Harry credit for was not trying to imitate the inimitable car chase from Bullet (1968). Magnum Force tries to rectify that error. A motorcycle chases a car down Vermont, the twistiest little street in the city, bar none. There are multiple crashes, a car explodes in a fireball, dead bodies (faceless and otherwise) abound, a pretty prostitute is made to drink a can of Drano and the camera shoots the scene from between her wildly waving legs. Whatever elements ground the original in reality are thrown away here in favor of cheap fantasy, a pandering of the worst sort.It probably looks pretty tame today. We ought to ask ourselves what that tells us about our vernacular culture.
