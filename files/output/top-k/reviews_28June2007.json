This is one of those movies which I was ashamed of not seeing, as it's still a classic in the history of motion pictures and the one of Akira Kurosawa's films that is described as a must-see for every movie freak there is. Having an 8.8\/10 rating and standing on the mighty 9th place at IMDb's Top 250 movies of all time -list it's pretty hard to watch it without having those huge expectations. The movie tells a story about a village which is constantly attacked and robbed by bandits. The village's eldest wise man suggests that the villagers should hire samurais, respected warriors, to defend the village, so some of the villagers leave their home to find samurais for the job. It doesn't take so much time until they find the ones, and these samurais form the group of the seven samurais, who each have their own personalities and ways of interacting.First of all, you really have to relate to the time when the movie was produced. It's nothing near the movies these days, it's completely different, obviously. I've watched a lot of Japanese movies in the past and this is no exception when it comes to this certain style of this specific tension seen from the screen. I wouldn't say it's boring, but it's somehow tedious. I mean, the movie requires this certain mood for the viewer, so you can't really watch it like any other film. The tempo is slow and sometimes the scenes seem like they're too lengthened, which needs a lot of concentration and nerves, yet it's all worth it after all. The tempo of Shichinin no samurai has this nice way of speeding up towards the end, so it gets faster and faster all the time, though there are some of those slow scenes between. I can't really describe those scenes in any other way than slow, as it's really hard to explain it after all. Over three hours of one movie is always pretty heavy, no matter what the movie itself was. This is a heavy movie, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be worth watching. The music is these dark and gloomy orchestrations, which really fit in the main theme of the movie so well and though it doesn't include relaxed or soothing compositions it still is overall a great experience, composed by Fumio Hayasaka it builds up tension in a flowing way and it's sort of adapted in the exactly right places. It definitely has that 50's feel to it, but it's still original.One thing that immediately crosses your mind when the movie progresses itself is how incredibly well it's made considering when it is actually made. If you look at the 50's, there weren't any computers so CGI was obviously out of question. This basically means that everything you see on the screen is actually the real deal, everything that moves actually moves and everything that happens actually happens. This is what you have to pay attention to when you're watching the movie, as then you finally realise why it truly was such a big hit back then and why it immediately formed itself as a classic. A born legend some could say. The cinematography compliments the whole credibility the film offers for the viewer. It is a little bit different than Japanese cinematography nowadays, but there's still that same feeling and emotion. To me as a fan of Japanese cinematography Shichinin no samurai didn't disappoint me; Wide endless landscapes, those beautiful boundless hills and lands, it's honestly always a treat for you. Japanese also tend to use so much more still shots than any other nation and that is one of the things that form that certain well-known feeling and emotion.When you really relate to the time the directing doesn't disappoint you either. It's no wonder people have been buzzing about this film for ages as it is indeed Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, a real specimen of skill. The thing that surprised me though was that the role performances can actually be compared to role performances these days, in Japanese films that is. The acting in this movie still has that certain anger, that somehow believable incredibility, that Japanese original way of acting, which also can not be compared to any other nation. Japanese films live in their own time and hopefully that'll always be the case, as when you're bored of Hollywood you can always change to a different perspective; The Japanese perspective.Shichinin no samurai is timeless. It doesn't matter if you'd watch it even after 100 years from its release, it's a movie everyone should see, though it does require certain age from the viewer. This is not a movie for children after all as it's pretty violent too. Having huge expectations on a movie always gets me so stressed and to be really honest I thought the movie would have been better. But as a person in my 20's what can you really expect from a movie made in the 50's? It's like eating the same cereals years after years and then suddenly changing to porridge with sugar and milk in it. It's like drinking a long drink and then changing to whiskey. The difference gap is just so huge. Shichinin no samurai is a brilliant film if you can relate to the time, though it is pretty long-winded it does get better after a few days when you've seen it. You don't really get it at first, but just give yourself some time to repeat the events occurred in the movie and soon you see yourself perceiving the whole meaning of the movie, what's it all about and what it tries to tell you, the whole purpose of it. Magnificent indeed.

Demolition Man is the single exception. In fact, it may be the best film Stallone has ever done. Because its a vehicle perfectly suited to him. Its an actioner, but also a very funny satire on Political Correctness gone mad.Beginning in 1996, Los Angeles is a war zone. Stallone is renegade cop John Spartan, nicknamed the Demolition Man. Spartan is assigned to rescue hostages from psychotic criminal Simon Phoenix (a platinum blond Wesley Snipes). Spartan gets Phoenix, but when he accidentally blows up the building with the hostages inside, the two enemies share the same fate. They both wind up in cryo-prison, where they will be frozen, programmed and conditioned to become productive members of society, and then thawed out at a later date.Shifting to 2032, instead of the dystopian vision of the future we were expecting, Los Angeles (or San Angeles as its now called) has become a peaceful society. The world has become a very happy place. A place of no crime, no hate, and no sex!! The benevolent dictator (if there is such a thing!) of San Angeles, Dr Cocteau (Nigel Hawthorne) is none too happy that some citizens are not following his grand, master plan. Some people have broken away from society and live underground, wanting to live their own lives, led by fast-talking leader, Edgar Friendly (Denis Leary). Raiding the surface world for food and supplies, Cocteau wants them dealt with. And he has a radical plan. Thaw out Simon Phoenix to kill Edgar Friendly.Of course it doesn't work out that way, and Phoenix is far more interested in taking over the defenceless San Angeles, which rapidly becomes the war zone it once was. Since the police (SAPD) are ill-equipped to handle this, they come up with a radical plan of their own. Thaw out John Spartan to deal with Simon Phoenix. Partnered up with SAPD cop Lenina Huxley (a delightfully perky Sandra Bullock), in the hunt for Phoenix, they wind up tearing down the hideously nice San Angeles in the process.Demolition Man is a very funny satirical version of the future. Its observations are not as astute as RoboCop, but there are occasions where it is an action film of striking intelligence. The fact that the future is so nice and non-violent is a neat twist on what we usually expect from stories about our oncoming future. But the novelty is that San Angeles is so nice and non-threatening that it's almost scary. And just as frightening as any dystopia. From 1984 to Children of Men.There are lots of wonderful throwaway gags too, packed away into the background. There are too many to mention, but I like the neat little touches the film keeps coming up with. Like when Dr Cocteau holds a meeting, instead of addressing people in person, at the conference table are these little TV screens that swivel around as Cocteau walks about. And the cars of the future drive themselves. OK, that one's not so unexpected. But buildings that clean up after themselves! Bet you didn't see that one coming!Whenever Sylvester Stallone has tried his hand at comedy, the result is usually disastrous because he's seemed ill at ease with the material. But with Demolition Man, he looks like he's having a whale of a time. His utter contempt for San Angeles is very amusing, and I love the running gag of the monitors that fine you if you swear. Something Spartan puts to use when he can't figure out how the toilets work. Watch and you will see! A thinly disguised act of contempt against order.But the one major plus in the film's favour is the wonderful Sandra Bullock. It's hard to believe she was nominated for a Razzie award, because she's the best thing about the film. This is just before she found fame in Speed, and with Demolition Man, she displays comic timing of the best sort. Lenina's a supposed aficionado of 20th Century culture, something she proudly tells Spartan every chance she gets. But she only gets things half right. Messing up all the colloquialisms You can take this job and shovel it. He really matched his meet.Stallone and Bullock are a wonderful pair. All the most joyful moments in the film come from their scenes together. There's a really cute scene when Lenina takes Spartan back to her place to have sex. But in 2032, sex has become slightly different. Now there's no touching. Just virtual reality helmets to simulate it. Their wires get seriously crossed, and both Lenina and Spartan are baffled at what the other person wants (Fluid transfer, yuck!).Wesley Snipes is not bad in the part of the villain. He throws himself into it with real larger than life abandon, even if a lot of his puns are atrocious. But he handles the action scenes well enough. He could have done without the peroxide hairstyle though.And as for Nigel Hawthorne, well he looks a little out of place in the film. He's an actor who looks more at home on the stage or in a period piece, and I get the impression he's a bit uncomfortable acting in an action vehicle. Its a performance phoned in on his part, which might explain why he gets killed just a little over halfway through.But nevertheless, Demolition Man has much to recommend. It moves at a brisk pace, its funny and exciting in all the right places, and as action films go, its quite witty too. Love the snide comment Sly makes towards Arnie, who goes on to be President. Only intended as a pun at the time, but he's Governor now isn't he? Who knows? It could happen!

Some people have broken away from society and live underground, wanting to live their own lives, led by fast-talking leader, Edgar Friendly (Denis Leary). Raiding the surface world for food and supplies, Cocteau wants them dealt with. And he has a radical plan. Thaw out Simon Phoenix to kill Edgar Friendly.Of course it doesn't work out that way, and Phoenix is far more interested in taking over the defenceless San Angeles, which rapidly becomes the war zone it once was. Since the police (SAPD) are ill-equipped to handle this, they come up with a radical plan of their own. Thaw out John Spartan to deal with Simon Phoenix. Partnered up with SAPD cop Lenina Huxley (a delightfully perky Sandra Bullock), in the hunt for Phoenix, they wind up tearing down the hideously nice San Angeles in the process.Demolition Man is a very funny satirical version of the future. Its observations are not as astute as RoboCop, but there are occasions where it is an action film of striking intelligence. The fact that the future is so nice and non-violent is a neat twist on what we usually expect from stories about our oncoming future. But the novelty is that San Angeles is so nice and non-threatening that it's almost scary. And just as frightening as any dystopia. From 1984 to Children of Men.There are lots of wonderful throwaway gags too, packed away into the background. There are too many to mention, but I like the neat little touches the film keeps coming up with. Like when Dr Cocteau holds a meeting, instead of addressing people in person, at the conference table are these little TV screens that swivel around as Cocteau walks about. And the cars of the future drive themselves. OK, that one's not so unexpected. But buildings that clean up after themselves! Bet you didn't see that one coming!Whenever Sylvester Stallone has tried his hand at comedy, the result is usually disastrous because he's seemed ill at ease with the material. But with Demolition Man, he looks like he's having a whale of a time. His utter contempt for San Angeles is very amusing, and I love the running gag of the monitors that fine you if you swear. Something Spartan puts to use when he can't figure out how the toilets work. Watch and you will see! A thinly disguised act of contempt against order.But the one major plus in the film's favour is the wonderful Sandra Bullock. It's hard to believe she was nominated for a Razzie award, because she's the best thing about the film. This is just before she found fame in Speed, and with Demolition Man, she displays comic timing of the best sort. Lenina's a supposed aficionado of 20th Century culture, something she proudly tells Spartan every chance she gets. But she only gets things half right. Messing up all the colloquialisms You can take this job and shovel it. He really matched his meet.Stallone and Bullock are a wonderful pair. All the most joyful moments in the film come from their scenes together. There's a really cute scene when Lenina takes Spartan back to her place to have sex. But in 2032, sex has become slightly different. Now there's no touching. Just virtual reality helmets to simulate it. Their wires get seriously crossed, and both Lenina and Spartan are baffled at what the other person wants (Fluid transfer, yuck!).Wesley Snipes is not bad in the part of the villain. He throws himself into it with real larger than life abandon, even if a lot of his puns are atrocious. But he handles the action scenes well enough. He could have done without the peroxide hairstyle though.And as for Nigel Hawthorne, well he looks a little out of place in the film. He's an actor who looks more at home on the stage or in a period piece, and I get the impression he's a bit uncomfortable acting in an action vehicle. Its a performance phoned in on his part, which might explain why he gets killed just a little over halfway through.But nevertheless, Demolition Man has much to recommend. It moves at a brisk pace, its funny and exciting in all the right places, and as action films go, its quite witty too. Love the snide comment Sly makes towards Arnie, who goes on to be President. Only intended as a pun at the time, but he's Governor now isn't he? Who knows? It could happen!

Demolition Man is the single exception. In fact, it may be the best film Stallone has ever done. Because its a vehicle perfectly suited to him. Its an actioner, but also a very funny satire on Political Correctness gone mad.Beginning in 1996, Los Angeles is a war zone. Stallone is renegade cop John Spartan, nicknamed the Demolition Man. Spartan is assigned to rescue hostages from psychotic criminal Simon Phoenix (a platinum blond Wesley Snipes). Spartan gets Phoenix, but when he accidentally blows up the building with the hostages inside, the two enemies share the same fate. They both wind up in cryo-prison, where they will be frozen, programmed and conditioned to become productive members of society, and then thawed out at a later date.Shifting to 2032, instead of the dystopian vision of the future we were expecting, Los Angeles (or San Angeles as its now called) has become a peaceful society. The world has become a very happy place. A place of no crime, no hate, and no sex!!

It isn't a perfect movie but it sure makes the difference.Through the years the successive re-releases of this movie saved it, giving it the deserved credit and success, but when this initially came out in 1951 it was a failure and largely criticized.I heard that Walt Disney didn't like very much the character Alice because in his opinion she was cold. I don't see why Walt Disney had that opinion about her. There's nothing cold about her. I think she's a nice little girl. When she falls in despair, it's easy to feel sorry for her.Some parts of this movie are a bit weak, but that's not a major flaw. My least favorite character is obviously the Queen of Hearts. I don't like her at all. I guess nobody likes her, because she is meant to be hateable.But apart that this movie is full of awesome characters the Cheshire Cat, the Dormouse, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Caterpillar, the White Rabbit, the army of cards, Alice, Alice's sister, Dinah, the Doorknob and even strange creatures like a dog-broom, duck-horns, bird-mirrors, bird-cages, bird-pencils, etc...The creativity of this movie is not only on its peculiar characters, but also on its extravagant details sceneries, gardens, places, original designs, etc...What also makes this movie so different is the personality of the characters they're all mad, but hilarious (except the explosive Queen of Hearts, of course) and they do the craziest and silliest things. That makes them so funny. The silly humor of this movie is very classic, which is another big attribute.Only in Alice in Wonderland you can see hilarious things such as the unbirthday tea party celebrated by the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the cute Dormouse.Where else you can see such an enigmatic and cool character like the Cheshire Cat, a mad character with great sense of humor and the power of becoming invisible? Only in Alice in Wonderland, of course.Dinah (Alice's kitten) is one of the cutest Disney animals. She was drawn to be cute and adorable, like Figaro and others. The way she movies her little paws is so lovely and so is the way she chases Alice. To see kittens like Dinah and Figaro makes you wish to have a cat like that.Richard Haydn is hilarious as the Caterpillar, a character who speaks in a very calm way, but with a voice that seems to come from his nose and a short temper.The great Sterling Holloway has one of his most spectacular performances ever as the voice of the amazing Cheshire Cat.The unforgettable Ed Wynn gives such an energetic performance as the voice of the Mad Hatter and Jerry Colonna is great as the March Hare's voice.Bill Thompson is cool as the White Rabbit's voice. But I must say that Kathryn Beaumont is wonderful as Alice's voice, James MacDonald is fabulous as the Dormouse's voice, Joseph Kearns is funny as the Doorknob's voice and Heather Angel is awesome as the voice of Alice's sister.

Sorry, it just ain't true, even in America. I'm afraid to say that I loathed the way that America took this message to its heart even more than I loathed the message.And I have always disliked the way the Academy often favours disease of the week performances (I always rated Ernie Hudson's performance as a similarly afflicted character in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle - why did that get overlooked?).But let me be fair. There is a short sequence where Gump tries to ask Jenny if his son is normal - maybe 20 seconds in total.

My advice is when going into this, don't expect a horror film. Despite an unnerving atmosphere, there are few actual shocks, nor are there many attempts to scare the audience. The purpose of director Georges Franju was to fashion a surrealist fantasy in the style of Jean Cocteau. He succeeded admirably in that department. The storyline of a mad doctor looking for suitable donors for his disfigured daughter is cheap b-movie fodder and has been redone many times (many times by Jess Franco). However, Franju did it first and his version is wickedly intelligent.One of the main reasons why the film works is because of how believable the characters are in such fantastic situations. Despite the supernatural occurrences, their reactions and dialog remain completely realistic. This aspect is helped out by the performances, all of which are subtle and perfectly nuanced. Some have criticized this cold and clinical approach to the material, but it works perfectly. As much as I love vintage drive-in horror films, I love this film's more artistic style. Some may find it slow and I can understand that. The film is far from the schlock it's original title, the ridiculous moniker The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus. Not only is there no chamber, but this gives viewers the impression the film is a bloodbath. Sure, there's some shocking ahead of its time brutality (especially the infamous surgery sequence), but its filmed with the same poetic style as everything else. Its grotesque but not sensationalist. Others, such as myself, will treasure what may be the most beautiful horror film ever made.

I can't think of any other actor who could have done the role justice. Murray captures not only the humor, but also lets his character grow and become much more sympathetic as the film progresses.Harold Ramis, the director, also has to take great credit for this, as his pacing for the whole film is absolutely flawless. It's disappointing that Ramis has never come close to making this quality of film again...Also, Andie McDowell gives by far and away her best ever performance in this movie. Her and Murray have great chemistry and she is the perfect foil for him right throughout the film.This is truly and wonderful and uplifting film which everyone should see, and more than once!
