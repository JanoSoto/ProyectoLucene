When you think of '50's science-fiction movies, you think of Ed Wood like movies with laughable special effects, a weak story and below average B-movie stars and persons in rubber-suits. Not really the kind of movie to take very seriously.But yes, luckily The Thing from Another World is a rare exception. OK I'll admit that the story itself is still quite ridicules at times. I mean, the alien is basically explained in the movie as being a large vegetable. It does make the movie a bit too silly and certainly outdated to watch at times. But then again on the other hand, The Thing from Another World is still very different from other science-fiction movies from the same period, in a positive way.The movie is unique and differers from others in multiple ways. It even in some regard was quite ahead of its time and it inspired many other horror\/science-fiction movie later to come.The characters in the movie are all portrayed as strong individual characters with their own thoughts and emotions. It does give the movie a certain sense of realism, even though the story itself is of course far from being realistic. The movie also features a typical scientific- versus military way of thinking. That concept is not unique and is also still often featured in movie made this present day but the way that it is handled in this movie is extremely well and it does provide the movie with some tense and unpredictable moments.Also the way the 'monster', or in this case rather said the alien is handled is quite unique. The alien itself doesn't actually play such a prominent role in the movie in terms of how often and how long it appears on screen. The alien is never seen in close-up which adds to the suspense and mystery of the movie. Of course the look of the alien is by today's standards terribly outdated but that now has become part of the charm of the movie. The fact that he more often is off the screen rather than on it, provides the movie with some good and tense moments and also the moments that he does pop-up make provides the movie with some good scares (atleast for '50's standards that is.) because you don't really expect it. Kind of like the same way the tension in Jaws is build up.Another thing, which I thought was absolutely great about this movie was the dialog. The dialog fits all of the characters extremely well and helps to add to their own strong individual personality. The actors which portray them are perhaps not the great but thanks to the dialog all of them are extremely believable and fitting in their roles.The storytelling is slow yet the pace is high. The movie takes its time to build up the story and introduce the characters, which all yet again add to the 'realism' of the movie. The way the story is told makes the movie seem even more mysterious and tenser than the story really is. I also like the way everything in the movie is scientifically explained, something that most often in movies like these never was the case.The Thing from Another World is an unique, influential and in many ways a movie that was ahead of its time in terms of character treatment and storytelling. Therefor this movie is a marvelous one, that will be enjoyed by all but probably especially mainly by the movie-buffs among us. Either way, a highly recommendable movie for all!10\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"29 March 2006","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Let's face it, most of the science-fiction movies made in the '50's were utter trash.

All hilarity aside, the exorcism scene is one of pure thrills. It's completely compelling, exciting and will never lose a viewer's interest. The events to show Reagan's possession are some great disturbing moments, and all of them combined together give the illusion of something far more shocking and terrifying than any human could ever be.

Dunst also surprised me with her excellent singing, and Martin Short is hilarious as a high school drama coach,plus while the ending is corny, it still brought a smile to my face, as it was really cute. One of the funniest scenes in the movie for me is when Dunst shoots Foster with that arrow gun thing right in the arm! and Colin Hanks and Sisq are funny as Foster's best friends, plus it's also a cool teen variation of a Mid Summer's Night Dream.

Kirsten Dunst is wonderful as always, she is incredibly gorgeous,very cute, extremely likable, wonderfully perky, had pretty good chemistry with Ben Foster, and had a great character, one that you can fall for easy, as it's easy to see why she's rising up so fast now. Ben Foster is great as the lead, he is extremely likable, had a cool character, and one that I could relate too, as I recognized him from Hostage, as he was great there too, he is also quite funny!. Melissa Sagemiller is pretty good looking and does her job very well as Allison, at times I thought her character was a bit selfish, but overall I really dug her. Sisqó and Colin Hanks are awesome as Foster's buddies and brought lots of laughs to the film. Shane West is excellent as the Dick, he annoyed the crap out of me, as he did a great job of doing that, he was extremely convincing. Mila Kunis is hot and did what she had to do well as the best friend of Dunst's. Martin Short is hilarious as the high school drama coach, and went totally OTT I loved it!.

It succeeds at being none of them. It tries to be clever. It tries to be original. It tries to be witty.Anyway, people will tell you that this film is original. They are wrong. Things which appear to be original are, in fact, stolen from science fiction stories which have a much higher level of quality.

The scenes of the characters in phone booths lets us know immediately who they are and what they're about. We know Lionel Barrymore's dying; John Barrymore's up to something. Phone booths are supposed to be private, but we're allowed to eavesdrop on people's intimate conversations - it's thrilling, a great way to kick-start a film. By the time we entered the lobby, with that wonderful three and a half minute (I timed it!) elevated shot of everything that's going on, with the characters wandering in and out of the frame, hanging in the background, I was helplessly lost in the action. I literally said to myself this is great. A big goofy smile on my face, I watched the film get better and better.Every single performance, with the possible exception of Garbo, is flawless. A far cry from my opinion of him in Dinner At Eight, I thought Beery was very good, delivering a blustering, dominant performance, but sad, almost child-like, at times.Crawford (the first film of hers I've seen) was, at least to me, a revelation. I can't shake the image of her with that Baby Jane look, and I was surprised at how beautiful she was here. Her scheming is so subtle I hardly noticed it until the very end. Then I replayed her scenes in my mind and everything fit into place. Was she always this sassy? Garbo was possibly the weakest link. She was impressive, don't get me wrong, but there's something dated about her acting, something that just didn't sit right. I don't know, maybe she's too iconic. When she didn't have Barrymore to act with I felt she was lacking something.John Barrymore was excellent. I simply cannot fault anything this man does. He's now sharing my favourite actor spot with Brando.But Lionel Barrymore stole it. His turn as the dying, socially awkward geek living life for the first time is one of the best performances I've ever seen. Absolutely tragic. The scene immediately before he dances with Crawford made me cry. The guy was heart-breaking. From his mumbling complaints at the front desk, just trying to be heard, to his desperate search for his pocketbook, while the thief wrestles with his conscience, to his confrontation with Beery, he was note-perfect. His gesticulations, the movement of his eyes, the strained look on his face, everything screamed sadness, desperation, and dignity.The music was perfect. It seemed to almost never stop. Waltzes echoing the way the characters danced around each other, whether it's to steal pearls, bed stenographers, coax insecure ballerinas, or confront tyrannical bosses.The direction was often dizzying The previously mentioned shot (and there were more than a few others) that seemed to go on forever; the shots looking down on the distant lobby far below, in all its deco glory.Not a frame is wasted. It's one of the very few films I'd be happy to see run an hour longer. It's snappy, fast-paced, glamorous, sexy, sophisticated, funny, and ultimately tragic.

But whatever tag you wish to stick on it, this honest, low-budget humdinger from Liman is very very money! Top 10 reasons to get your hands on this movie now (1) It's fast-paced, well edited (not one wasted scene) and frequently laugh-out-loud funny. If you hear people dismiss this as an inconsequential narrative about a bunch of losers trying to get laid, I'm afraid they just have not watched the entire movie. I am not into the Spy who shagged me genre of humor, but this movie will truly grow on you.(2) It'll ring a bell with almost anyone, particularly guys. Mike -- a crestfallen loverboy (Jon Favreau) is in the throes of a breakup, and his confidence has hit rock bottom. (Sidenote Favreau is a very ordinary looking guy, which in fact imho is the power of his character.) Under the aegis of his friend Trent (Vince Vaughn, in top form, a lot better than his controlled acting in, gulp, The Psycho) Mike re-learns how to get back up on his feet and take reins of his life\/emotions again. While this happens, we are treated to a bunch of every-day faux pas that we all can identify with in a blink. Interested yet? (3) The boys' camaraderie is infectious. If you watch this movie with friends -- and this indeed is the best way to watch it! -- you'll know what I mean. This has to be one of the most honest portrayals of relationships between friends -- both the lover and the platonic variety.(4) Call me weird but I loved the sound track, a delectable blend of underground jazz and triphop.(5) Some of the get back on your feet dialogue for Mike is truly marvellous, and makes for better, more down-to-earth, more inspiring advice about life and relationships than Dr. Ruth and Oprah put together.(6) An interesting look at the Los Angeles we never see in films, the underground life of the struggling actors and writers and less glamorous people, not living in Malibu opulence as seen in other weaker films.(7) Some great Sega Genesis NHL ice-hockey footage (to use a dignified term) and an unusual preview of seeing Gretzky's head knocked.(8) This is to men what Sex and the City is to women. (Ok, SATC has had a lot more time than Swingers to entice us with the workings of the Modern Woman, but you get the idea) (9) A wide assortment of one-liners for you to conveniently plagiarize from. Not seen in a single movie since Roxanne with Steve Martin.(10) Oh, and it's so laid back, its horizontal. No spiffy visual FX, no crash boom bang, no cheap frills. But still a high handsome homerun.

Evil on the other hand convinces himself he is not enslaved, or destined to lose, but in fact, he is just setting up the moment for him to be victorious. He also refuses to be counted as a created being, he has convinced himself he is an equal to God, and in fact, more worthy of God's position due to his intellect and intent. Which is all in fact his arrogance, which started his rebellious trouble in the first place. Almost all the characters are dubious, depressed, failures, or those trying hard but just not able to completely win out the internal\/external battle of being good but having an evil nature.

It plays with the downtrodden, British humorist view of life. Gilliam is a genius, I just don't always like his stuff. Time Bandits, like Brazil, is the very best of his stuff. The hero is a rather naive boy living in a world that offers him only bored continuity. Then the dwarfs fall into his room and spirit him away on this fantastic journey. The dwarfs are anti-heroes themselves, driven by greed. The play between God and Satan here shows remarkable understanding of just who they are according to Gilliam's interpretation of the Bible. Good, played by a fine, aged English gentleman, states evil must exist because it offhandedly has something to do with freewill. Evil on the other hand convinces himself he is not enslaved, or destined to lose, but in fact, he is just setting up the moment for him to be victorious. He also refuses to be counted as a created being, he has convinced himself he is an equal to God, and in fact, more worthy of God's position due to his intellect and intent. Which is all in fact his arrogance, which started his rebellious trouble in the first place.

Even though this came out years ago, I just saw it for the first time recently though I was already familiar with the general story. I found it to be a wonderful movie.Renee Zellweger and Morgan Freeman deliver performances that are flawless, effortless.....they make it look so EASY!!(Which of coarse it is not.) But these two are among the most talented movie performers working today and they are both at their best in this film. Most people reading this will be familiar with the plot but even if the plot doesn't sound like their type of thing, this movie should definitely be seen by any major Freeman or Zellweger fan.Not only are the performances incredible, from the rest of the cast as well, but the story is delightfully different and sucks you in. The main characters are fascinating and the story is both funny and touching. The whole soap opera story line is great and I must mention Greg Kinnear who is great as the superficial, annoyingly narcissistic soap opera actor as well. I actually knew someone who reminded me very much of this guy. Kinnear creates a character who maybe annoying but who is very believable all the same and he's just another example of a great casting choice.This is a movie that somehow retains all the good in the quirky type of film, while avoiding the negative stuff. The story even though it's almost unbelievable, feels believable and these are no cookie cutter characters, we feel like we know them. Zellweger exhibits the same star quality she did in Jerry Mguire, and later, Chicago and Bridget Jones' Diary.The road scenery was stunning and I happen to like road movies so that was appealing as well. Nurse Betty, in addition to being funny, and touching, is melancholy and from a cinematography level, lovely. There isn't much not to like in this film and I can't believe it's the same director who did In The Company Of Men, a movie I really really disliked.The only things I did not like in this movie are the amount of violence and the ending which seemed to happen a little abruptly and seemed a little rushed after the powerful scene between freeman and Zellweger. But those are small things. This is a strong 8.5 of 10 and a movie I definitely plan to watch again. I'd say this movie is a must see.

That's mainly because I have the video tape and DVD of this movie. I must say that as many times as I have seen this movie, it is still good. One of the things that I like about this movie is that even though it is a comedy, it shows people on all sides of the spectrum. I.E. the haves and the have-not. Just in the opening sequence alone, we go back and forth between between the lives of the well-to-do in their luxurious homes and the poor who are often living on the streets. Also, this movie shows in a comedic way what can happen when someone who is used to having everything is stripped away from it and when someone who is used to not having anything suddenly accumulates wealth.I will give a brief synopsis of the film and then I want to comment about the film in general. Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy play two elderly brothers in Philadelphia who have a commodities business. One day, they make a bet that they could strip their star employee, played by Dan Aykroyd, from everything he has been accustomed to and at the same time, take a street-bum, played by Eddie Murphy, and turn into a successful executive. The brothers arrange for that to happen and as a result, there are a number of misunderstandings as both Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy try to sort out what has been done to them. Once they finally meet up and compare notes on what has been done to them, they come up with some revenge plans of their own.One of the things I like about TRADING PLACES is the acting. Both Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy were excellent as the two Duke brothers. It should be noted that TRADING PLACES helped rejuvenate Don Ameche's film career. Denholm Elliot was good as the butler who worked for the brothers. His character is interesting because at first, he co-operated with the brothers' plan but then after a while, he kind of turned to Dan Aykroyd's side when he saw how cruel the bet was. Jamie Lee Curtis was good as Dan Aykroyd's love interest in the film. I have heard some people refer to her character as having a heart of gold. Both Dan Aykroyd's character and Eddie Murphy's character are interesting because they change a great deal throughout the film due to the circumstances they find themselves in.There are so many scenes that I love in this film that I can't possibly mention all of them. However, I will mention a few that stand out in my mind. For one, I love how Dan Aykroyd is ready to strangle Eddie Murphy thinking he was the one who ruined him and Eddie Murphy says It was the Dukes! It was the Dukes! I like the bit when Eddie Murphy is going to the office on his first day of work and says to the the butler What if I can't do it (the work)? Denholm Elliot says in his British accent, Just be yourself Sir. Whatever happens, they CAN'T take that away from you. In fact, that is a scene I think of whenever I have to do something that seems a bit uncomfortable. I also want to point out the scene where Don Ameche shouts to a bunch of men F**k Him! when he realizes that he and Ralph Bellamy have lost all their savings. What is kind of strange is that I am not used to seeing an elderly person curse in public. Anyway, I would say that the whole revenge scene is a riot.

Case in point, there is a scene where Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche are sitting at their desks. If you look closely, Ralph Bellamy has a picture of Ronald Reagan at his desk and Don Ameche has a picture of Richard Nixon at his desk. I point this out because while it is subtle, it shows that these men are your typical conservative business person who supports the policies of leaders like Nixon and Reagan. Also, I want to point out some motiffs in the movie. In the beginning of the film, one of the characters says to Dan Aykroyd Looking good there Louis! and he responds with Feeling good Todd. At the end of the film, Dan Aykroyd says Looking good there Billy Ray! to Eddie Murphy and he (Murphy) replies with Feeling good Louis! Also, near the beginning of the film when Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy make a wager for the bet that reversed the lives of both Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd's characters, it is for $1. Later on, when Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd turn around make themselves a bet, it is for $1. I find these to be a few of the many subtle but interesting observations found in TRADING PLACES.

That's mainly because I have the video tape and DVD of this movie. I must say that as many times as I have seen this movie, it is still good. One of the things that I like about this movie is that even though it is a comedy, it shows people on all sides of the spectrum. I.E. the haves and the have-not. Just in the opening sequence alone, we go back and forth between between the lives of the well-to-do in their luxurious homes and the poor who are often living on the streets. Also, this movie shows in a comedic way what can happen when someone who is used to having everything is stripped away from it and when someone who is used to not having anything suddenly accumulates wealth.I will give a brief synopsis of the film and then I want to comment about the film in general. Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy play two elderly brothers in Philadelphia who have a commodities business. One day, they make a bet that they could strip their star employee, played by Dan Aykroyd, from everything he has been accustomed to and at the same time, take a street-bum, played by Eddie Murphy, and turn into a successful executive. The brothers arrange for that to happen and as a result, there are a number of misunderstandings as both Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy try to sort out what has been done to them. Once they finally meet up and compare notes on what has been done to them, they come up with some revenge plans of their own.One of the things I like about TRADING PLACES is the acting. Both Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy were excellent as the two Duke brothers. It should be noted that TRADING PLACES helped rejuvenate Don Ameche's film career. Denholm Elliot was good as the butler who worked for the brothers. His character is interesting because at first, he co-operated with the brothers' plan but then after a while, he kind of turned to Dan Aykroyd's side when he saw how cruel the bet was. Jamie Lee Curtis was good as Dan Aykroyd's love interest in the film. I have heard some people refer to her character as having a heart of gold. Both Dan Aykroyd's character and Eddie Murphy's character are interesting because they change a great deal throughout the film due to the circumstances they find themselves in.There are so many scenes that I love in this film that I can't possibly mention all of them. However, I will mention a few that stand out in my mind. For one, I love how Dan Aykroyd is ready to strangle Eddie Murphy thinking he was the one who ruined him and Eddie Murphy says It was the Dukes! It was the Dukes! I like the bit when Eddie Murphy is going to the office on his first day of work and says to the the butler What if I can't do it (the work)? Denholm Elliot says in his British accent, Just be yourself Sir. Whatever happens, they CAN'T take that away from you.

From the time when you see the famous shipwreck, to the very end, you will just stare at the screen in awe. This is my opinion of the movie, and I know that probably many people would disagree with me. What more could you ask for in a movie? Suspense, romance, some comedy between the conversations of Jack and Rose, drama, almost every genre fits it. When you first see the drawing of young Rose that is found in the safe of the wreck, you are confused as to what it might be, but find it beautiful just the same. Hearing that old Rose is almost 101, you might find it hard to be realistic, but by the end of the movie when Jack is making Rose promise to go on with her life without him, you believe anything this movie has to throw at you. When Rose Calvert begins her story, you are shown a young woman who is sick of her first class life, and wants to break free from her chains. A man named Jack Dawson is also shown playing a poker game, and attempting to win the third class tickets that were bet on the ship of dreams. Of course, Rose and Jack meet and there is an instant connection, and half way through the movie, you want nothing more than both of them falling in love. After taking Rose flying out of her caged life, Rose and Jack do fall in love, even thought they've known each other for only a matter of days. While all of this is happening, you forget all about the dreadful iceberg that will eventually separate Jack and Rose physically for good. Just when you get attached to their story, the ship soon begins to sink. After watching both characters almost lose their lives in more than one way, you eventually witness Jack giving up the one space on the floating board so that Rose can live in place of him. A tear-jerker every single time you watch, the music alone will just make you start to tear up. Though the tragedy was unbelievably depressing, and leaves you with a heavy heart for days afterward, this wonderful record-breaking Oscar winning movie will have your heart. Now, almost 9 years since the movie came out, I still love it, and I know that it is a movie that I and many others will never tire of, for Titanic is one of the best films of all time!

However, when Chucky came to life almost 20 years ago, he was a real thrill that redefined the horror genre of the late 80s and spawned a series of imitators (some better than others).Director Tom Holland crafts this very original tale written by Don Mancini, where a dying sociopath (Brad Douriff) uses voodoo to transplant his soul to an inanimate toy. Catherine Hicks plays Karen Barclay, a single mother who gets the possessed toy for her little son Andy (Alex Vincent), not knowing what is hidden deep inside the doll.Despite its apparent cheesiness, Holland truly creates a haunting atmosphere filled with suspense by following the trick Steven Spielberg used in Jaws. While we know from the very beginning that the toy is haunted, we never get a glimpse of what he can do and neither does the characters; only the young Andy knows the truth, but nobody believes him.Unlike its current MTV-inspired incarnations, Child's Play starts a bit slow, but suddenly it turns into a suspense-filled roller-coaster with enough thrills to keep you at the edge of the seat.
