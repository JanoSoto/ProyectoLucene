And it maintains its humorous irony. It's always self aware and loves to parody itself and the genre it's set it. Finally, you have a decent cast (with previous cast members reprising their roles) who you actually care about.Okay, so it's neither as original as its predecessors, nor any film of the same genre, but, for a third instalment, it's actually a masterpiece. Horror films are famous for starting good then being milked for all they're worth, losing quality with each one. You could say that the quality has dropped here, but compared to all the other horror films, it's actually a masterpiece.If you like the Scream films, or just horror flicks in general, this one's right up there with the best of them.

They decide it's best not to go to the police fearing murder charges so they dump his body but a year later they begin getting harassed.Thanks to the success of Wes Craven's SCREAM the horror genre got a boost and soon after one slasher after another was being released. Out of all of them this one here is the best in my opinion because Kevin Williamson's screenplay goes away from all the self-mocking and instead delivers a very good story that works perfect as a drama but it also features the horror elements that slasher fans would come to expect. Throw in a very good cast and some likable characters and we're left with one of the better horror films to come out of this period. If SCREAM was a classic like HALLOWEEN then this here is more like a good stepchild in the same vein as a Friday THE 13TH.The thing I enjoyed most about this was the actual personal story of these four people who find their lives changed over a bad decision. The set up itself is pretty simple but it works extremely well because we've all been young and made foolish decisions and one of the best moments in the film comes when the four teens must decide whether or not to go to the cops. Their reasoning behind it is interesting and their thought process is something you don't typically see in a slasher. The damage that their decision has on their lives is something else brought up in the screenplay that works extremely well. All of this happens before we even get to the horror elements. The mystery surrounding the killer keeps you guessing for certain.The horror elements are all extremely good. I know some make fun of the Captain Gordon outfit but I thought it was rather effective and brought back memories from the giallo days of the 70s when killers wore nothing but black. Another thing that works are the actual chase scenes, which director Jim Gillespie manages to build up some nice tension. It also doesn't hurt that you actually like the characters, can connect with them and you don't want to see them killed. Hewitt, Gellar and Phillippe are all extremely good and believable in their roles as is Anne Heche in her supporting bit. Prinze Jr. is probably better here than anytime in his career, although that's not too much support I'm giving him.I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER certainly has a few flaws including the movie getting dragged out in the third party but overall it's a highlight of what the genre had to offer after the success of SCREAM.

HBO's Veep, created by the satirically minded Armando Iannucci, is a brutal comedy series that details the day to day life of the vice president. Don't expect to see an all-American woman pining for a better America, because you get a narcissist hungry for power. Netflix's House of Cards makes politics seem as dirty as the crime world, with elected officials offing enemies left and right, utilizing corruption for the sake of unbridled authority.In days past, there was something mystical about a candidate &#x97; the one we loved (not the Nixon of the race) seemed to be a sort of god who could do no wrong. Look at JFK, FDR; they were far from perfect, but their image, their reputation, turned them into unspeakably untouchable icons. But it seems post-Vietnam, post-Watergate, America has turned into a hotbed of negativity. We don't trust our sacred politicians like we used to. And so The Candidate is more relevant than ever. In 1972, the U.S. was just starting to turn into a bunch of pessimists. But now, we regard many of our elected officials in the same way we do the villain of a political thriller evil, devilishly evil. But smart. The Candidate is part black comedy, part political drama, all stitched together by an endlessly scathing screenplay and a finely tuned performance from Robert Redford. It isn't so much an emotional film as it is a witty commentary regarding the election process, and how most candidates go from freshly idealistic to power hungry after a mere few months of campaigning. The film doesn't tap into our fears in the same way All the President's Men did, or how Three Days of the Condor told us not to trust anyone sitting in office. Rather, it serves as a thought-provoker that makes us wonder if the smiles governmental hopefuls put on display are actually genuine. It's a bleak, bleak, movie, not so much because it is starkly negative but because it prefers to think that getting elected is a popularity contest, not a case of may the best man win. Redford plays Bill McKay, a 30-ish attorney who, on a whim, decides to run for Senate. Incumbent Crocker Jarmon (Don Porter) is slated to win &#x97; McKay, you see, has been approached by political specialist Marvin Lucas (Peter Boyle), who only wants McKay to act as a Democratic figure, not as serious competition. Jarmon, after all, cannot run unopposed. McKay knows he has little by way of chance, but, knowing he has the opportunity to spread his ideals around the state, does everything he can to potentially find success. And as the son of the former governor (Melvyn Douglas), with, not to mention, good looks that have captured much of the female vote, his possibilities may be stronger than Lucas could have ever imagined. Problem is, if McKay really wants to win, he'll have to, in some ways, trade many of his morals in favor of popularity.The Candidate is filmed as if it were a documentary, following McKay around until his positive nature completely breaks down and sardonic ickiness takes over. As the film begins, he is a charismatic intellect who has a way with words (he is a lawyer, after all). But by the end, he can hardly control himself from laughing attacks when faced with the bullsh-t of a television promotion. The more he campaigns, the more he becomes disgusted with the idea of politics &#x97; the officials are snakes who know how to manipulate the public. Morals, he finds out, are of little importance to his peers. Sounding good, looking good, speaking well, being agreeable, going against the grain of the now-hated person he's trying to rob the job of &#x97; those are the things that matter. You can forget about making the country a better place.Larner's Academy Award winning screenplay hits all the right notes &#x97; not mean but wicked, funny, but not overtly so. It isn't a comedy as much as it is a drama that realizes how ridiculous campaigning is, and it cackles along with McKay's increasing concerns. There is a great little scene that finds McKay in the back of a limo, reciting old lines from previous speeches. But after each sound bite he makes a sound of disgust, whether it be a gag, a cough, or a scoff. The sequence is subtle, yet it speaks volumes; have we gotten to a point in our election process where a particular quote, a particular fragment of a speech, matters more than the overall goal of a candidate?The film also contains one of Redford's finest performances, capturing his distinctly everyman appeal while heightening the sly humor he can easily project just by uttering a single line. He is the kind of actor that can deliver a line like We don't have sh-t in common and still remain likable; he is the kind of actor that can look unfazed by the presence of a cameoing Natalie Wood and not seem like a complete jerk. In The Candidate, we don't necessarily identify with him. Instead, we jump onto his back as he maneuvers through the jangling dishonesty of the election process. Here is a movie more interested in saying something than showcasing how great its actors are, how great its direction is. The Candidate doesn't move you; it causes you to think. And as the race for the presidency continually heats up these days, it is compelling viewing that has hardly aged in what it has to say.

It isn't a comedy as much as it is a drama that realizes how ridiculous campaigning is, and it cackles along with McKay's increasing concerns. There is a great little scene that finds McKay in the back of a limo, reciting old lines from previous speeches. But after each sound bite he makes a sound of disgust, whether it be a gag, a cough, or a scoff. The sequence is subtle, yet it speaks volumes; have we gotten to a point in our election process where a particular quote, a particular fragment of a speech, matters more than the overall goal of a candidate?The film also contains one of Redford's finest performances, capturing his distinctly everyman appeal while heightening the sly humor he can easily project just by uttering a single line. He is the kind of actor that can deliver a line like We don't have sh-t in common and still remain likable; he is the kind of actor that can look unfazed by the presence of a cameoing Natalie Wood and not seem like a complete jerk. In The Candidate, we don't necessarily identify with him. Instead, we jump onto his back as he maneuvers through the jangling dishonesty of the election process. Here is a movie more interested in saying something than showcasing how great its actors are, how great its direction is. The Candidate doesn't move you; it causes you to think. And as the race for the presidency continually heats up these days, it is compelling viewing that has hardly aged in what it has to say.

Thinking he's a god amongst women, he assumes his travel producer Rita, played by Andie MacDowell, lusts after him and he can't help but take pot shots at his cameraman Larry, played by Chris Elliott. Once Phil has completed his day and is trapped overnight in Punxsutawney due to a blizzard closing down the highway back to Pittsburgh, he ends up in a time loop that forces him to repeat the same day over and over. He seems to be the only person who remembers already going through that day previous and even when he gets so desperate as to kill himself, he continually wakes up at 6AM on Groundhog Day back in his bed and breakfast room.The movie focuses itself around the theme that to really achieve anything in life we must let go of ourselves and open up to those around us. Phil remains self-centered through much of the film. After he first tries repeated attempts to kill himself due to the imagined torture of spending eternity repeating a day he deems miserable, he continues to make the same mistakes as he takes advantage of the knowledge he gains to seduce Rita and steal money from an armored car.For much of the movie, the lighting is pretty drab. Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, at least through Phil's eyes, is very dull. Setting the movie on Groundhog Day in Pennsylvania as opposed to Miami Beach on the Fourth of July was obviously not just a coin flip by the writers. We are supposed to see the same dull, blandness that Phil sees and this lighting in Pennsylvania in February is very believable. In fact, we barely get even a hint of sunlight until the very end when Groundhog Day finally ends and life for Phil continues, lesson learned.The camera angles in this movie really reveal a lot about Phil as well. Much of the time we are looking up at him even if just slightly. This gives the impression that he's bigger than he really is and points to his inflated ego. When the camera cuts back and forth between Phil and whoever he is talking to in over-the-shoulder shots, we are looking from Phil's view down toward the person he is speaking with and up toward Phil from the opposite angle. On characters like Rita, this could be passed off as being because she is much shorter than Phil. But this angle is even used on characters the same height as Phil, such as Ned Ryerson. The exception to this is the Sheriff that closes the highway in the blizzard. In this case, the camera angle looking up from Phil toward him indicates the Sheriff's power but we also notice that we don't see any of Phil in these shots. As Phil starts to change his ways toward the end of the movie, the camera no longer looks down on the others but even Rita, who is obviously shorter, is shot from a lower angle as well making all the characters appear to be on level playing field with Phil.The film has a similar theme as another Bill Murray movie, Scrooged, which of course was based on the Charles Dickens' story A Christmas Carol. In both films, Murray plays a self-absorbed man who learns he must change his ways, however, Groundhog Day does a much better job with its message. This movie you can easily see the true struggle Phil must go through to open himself up to those around him and think about everyone else instead of himself for a change.

His face soon turns to sheer horror when his beloved heroes are routinely blown away by the evil Decepticons, and I was immediately transported back in time. Not only does the bespectacled Adam Goldberg (played by Sean Giambrone) remind me of my older brother, but I instantly recalled my own horror at seeing the likes of Ratchet, Ironhide and Prowl being casually blown to pieces.Your enjoyment of Transformers The Movie really depends on whether you roll your eyes or clap your hands like a child at the sound of un-ironic 80's cheese blaring over sketchy animation of giant robots. No will claim that this is a work of high art or even narratively consistent, but if you're even remotely invested in the ensemble of Autobots, the ensuing blood-bath (oil-bath?) will still no doubt be shocking. Characters are dismembered, decapitated and shot execution-style. Casual viewers or newcomers may have trouble distinguishing one Transformer from the next (something that the live-action Michael Bay movies struggle with), but the relentless carnage at least makes for a refreshing experience to the usual child-friendly fare.It also has Unicron, the big bad guy who is so huge he transforms into a planet. Voiced by Orson Welles in one of his last feature films, his operatic, ham-fisted growl combined with that opening tune still has the ability to give me chills. While Unicron commits planetary genocide in the opening moments, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) plans an all- out assault on the Decepticons. Prime's opposite number Megatron (Frank Welker) hears of the plans and attacks first, leaving the Autobots scattered and on the defensive. Following an attack on Autobot City, the Autbots flee with Megatron wounded and blasted into outer space. But Unicron wants the Matrix, a talisman of great power currently in the hands of Autobot Ultra Magnus (Robert Stack), and so re-creates Megatron as Galvatron (Leonard Nimoy) to recover it.The narrative consists of little more than one action scene after the next, full of explosions, gun-play, and fan-favourites the Dinobots cracking-wise. While these moments are generally entertaining and lovingly realised, they soon become quite tiresome. When good guy Hot Rod (Judd Nelson) lands on planet Junk and is attacked by the motorcycle-riding natives led by Wreck-Gar (Eric Idle), I just longed for some of them to sit down and have a conversation. This leads to a disappointingly underwhelming climax as Hot Rod, Galvatron and Unicron finally face-off. The animation is rather jittery but incredibly stylish, in a style seemingly lost with modern-day cartoons.

She is eventually kidnapped and held hostage but Dundee saves the day aided by Leroy Brown and his gang. They will eventually head back to Australia because the movie completely lacks any originality. Good photography cannot blindside the fact that this is just a predictable rehash. Director John Cornell manages to make the Australian night sequences effectively haunting but his screenplay is uninspiring. Hogan created Mick Dundee as an interesting case study of humour and culture but here he is basically reciting and so is Kozlowski as his damsel wife. Charles S. Dutton plays the standard issue Leroy Brown. He is amusing but perhaps had the spotlight been on him then maybe there would be something to be benefited. The one role that stood out positively is John Meillon as a friend of Mick's. The role isn't overly broad but he brings humour particularly during a small plot turn involving him aiming a gun at what he believes is the right target.

It follows Sandler as the son of the owner of a chain of hotels as he is set to take over the company, but his dad thinks he needs to sort his life out and doesn't trust him, so he threatens to give the company to Eric (the bad guy) who works in some high up position.
