It is enchanting. So much so that it took me up-teen viewings of the movie to notice anything to criticize. First, and so glaringly obvious, it galls me that it took me so long to notice, there is a HUGE timing discrepancy near the beginning. Bilbo had left the Shire, and Gandalf had warned Frodo to keep it secret, keep it safe and ran off to figure out what the Ring really was. He was in Gondor reading the account of Isildur, a country which took the Fellowship months to reach from Rivendell, and as he's reading there's a cut of one of the Nazgul talking to a hobbit. We assume from the architecture that the Rider is in the Shire, but even given the benefit of the doubt, no hobbits live further from Bag End than Bree. So the Rider could not be more than a couple days away from Frodo. Yet when Frodo goes to his house and all the windows and doors are open, the intruder turned out to be Gandalf. The relief was so great (though rather obviously contrived) that we never stop to think that even if Gandalf had had Shadowfax at this point, there was no way he could have beaten the Nazgul to Bag End, much less have time to sit down for tea and a chat. Second, though Christopher Lee did an excellent portrayal of Saruman, whoever scripted his dialogue must've come from writing B horror films. Practically every one of his lines is a cringe-worthy cliché. One of his greatest weapons is supposed to be his voice, his ability to convince anyone of anything. Not to mention the embarrassing fight scene between the two wizards. Two powers that have been around since before the world began and are the Middle Earth equivalent of arch angels would have a much subtler and more... um... dignified battle than tossing each other around the room. The last major objection I've developed is the portrayal of Sauron. Just the fact that they DID portray him. Tolkien never once physically described Sauron because he knew that his embodiment of evil would be severely limited by making it tangible. During the prologue, Sauron comes out and starts throwing people around, supposedly to show how powerful a warrior the Ring made him. But that is not the nature of the Ring. All of the evil in the story is very subtle. Gandalf came the closest to explaining this when he said he would want to use the Ring for good, but that it would turn his works to harm. Sauron is supposed to be the same way. He did not demand that the rulers of surrounding kingdoms subjugate themselves to him. He poisoned their minds, allowing them to continue to believe they were working for their own good, while really helping the forces of Mordor. Sauruman, Theoden, and Denethor all thought they were trying to promote themselves and protect their people even while being manipulated by Sauron. The movie, I guess did not have the time to develop these concepts well, but to see the thoughtful and subtle manipulation by evil turned into brute force was rather disappointing. Like I said, I truly love this film, I think it did nearly as perfect an adaptation of the masterwork novel as possible. I really had to like it enough to spend the time to find these problems.

Simply  put This is David Lynch at his invariable finest.For some, the words A David Lynch Film will be all the review you need. Fans of his previous work will instantly understand where I'm coming from. For those new to Lynch, his work is really something that you need to experience for yourself. No words can adequately describe what you will obtain from Mulholland Drive as no words can adequately describe the workings of your own inner psyche. Your interpretation of what unfolds will to a great extent be   a reflection of yourself, what makes you tick, how your mind goes about interpreting and analysing information and emotion. Do not expect a literal storyline, do not expect anything clear-cut, do not expect anything to be handed to you on a plate, do not expect the film to be one of escapism, and do not expect to turn your brain off.To quote from Blue Velvet, It's a strange world, and Lynch knows this only too well. Prepare for a perfectly executed, beautiful and arousing cinematic venture into the unknown. In a sense you can in fact look at Mullholland Dr. in a literal fashion, although I think this is cutting yourself short of what can actually be obtained from the film. One of the more literal interpretations I had of the movie is just the whole basic play with the 'dark underbelly of Hollywood' theme. After my second viewing of the film I always saw the first half of the film as a dream(non-reality) and the second half of the film as the actuality of the situation (reality). Take away all Lynch's moot cryptic clues and random scenes of unrelated (or are they?) madness, and what have you left? A woman who travels to Hollywood to follow her dreams of becoming an actress. In the first half we are shown her dream (or a manifestation of her dream) She is instantly loved and recognised by some of the Hollywood 'powers that be', scores a part as an actress almost simultaneously, falls passionately in love, lives in a beautiful house, etc, etc. And in the second half we are shown her reality she scores small parts and even then, only as a favour of a friend who is dating a famous director, she remains unnoticed, yearns for love that is eternally unobtainable, lives in a small and crummy flat, and worst of all...... her dreams are nothing more than that, and will never ever eventuate.This is but one interpretation. There are many more. And each cryptic clue or Lynchian twist that you add (the blue key, the cowboy, the dark man, the ashtray........and so forth) changes or gives entirely new meaning altogether.Another way to look at it is as a jumble of metaphors. For example..... the dark man in Mulholland Dr. is nothing more than a visual representation of Hollywood (the actuality of Hollywood, not the glamorous one we are led to believe on television). The dark, seething underbelly of tinsel-town itself.For me, I look at David Lynch films in the same way I would look at my own dreams. I find this the best way to describe to people, or at least make them understand where he's coming from. You know how in a dream things are all a bit mixed up and yet to you, at the time, they make perfect sense? Friends of yours who have never met talk in dreams like they have known each other their whole lives, locations by no means near to each other are walking distance in comparison, something that happened to you five years ago and something that happened five days ago blur together seamlessly in your dream and yet....... TO YOU..... it all makes perfect sense. It is more a representation of ideas (like a dream) than a linear story. And what you make of it really comes down to your personal interpretation of what it made you feel............ which may or may not be what Lynch intended you to feel in the first place.Perhaps his most poignant work since Blue Velvet, Mullholland Drive is a cinematic masterpiece from a director at the height of his craft. A riddle within a riddle. A paradox of perfection.Now you will see me one more time if you do good. You'll see me two more times if you do bad.

Do not expect a literal storyline, do not expect anything clear-cut, do not expect anything to be handed to you on a plate, do not expect the film to be one of escapism, and do not expect to turn your brain off.To quote from Blue Velvet, It's a strange world, and Lynch knows this only too well. Prepare for a perfectly executed, beautiful and arousing cinematic venture into the unknown. In a sense you can in fact look at Mullholland Dr. in a literal fashion, although I think this is cutting yourself short of what can actually be obtained from the film. One of the more literal interpretations I had of the movie is just the whole basic play with the 'dark underbelly of Hollywood' theme. After my second viewing of the film I always saw the first half of the film as a dream(non-reality) and the second half of the film as the actuality of the situation (reality). Take away all Lynch's moot cryptic clues and random scenes of unrelated (or are they?) madness, and what have you left? A woman who travels to Hollywood to follow her dreams of becoming an actress. In the first half we are shown her dream (or a manifestation of her dream) She is instantly loved and recognised by some of the Hollywood 'powers that be', scores a part as an actress almost simultaneously, falls passionately in love, lives in a beautiful house, etc, etc. And in the second half we are shown her reality she scores small parts and even then, only as a favour of a friend who is dating a famous director, she remains unnoticed, yearns for love that is eternally unobtainable, lives in a small and crummy flat, and worst of all...... her dreams are nothing more than that, and will never ever eventuate.This is but one interpretation. There are many more. And each cryptic clue or Lynchian twist that you add (the blue key, the cowboy, the dark man, the ashtray........and so forth) changes or gives entirely new meaning altogether.Another way to look at it is as a jumble of metaphors. For example..... the dark man in Mulholland Dr. is nothing more than a visual representation of Hollywood (the actuality of Hollywood, not the glamorous one we are led to believe on television). The dark, seething underbelly of tinsel-town itself.For me, I look at David Lynch films in the same way I would look at my own dreams. I find this the best way to describe to people, or at least make them understand where he's coming from. You know how in a dream things are all a bit mixed up and yet to you, at the time, they make perfect sense? Friends of yours who have never met talk in dreams like they have known each other their whole lives, locations by no means near to each other are walking distance in comparison, something that happened to you five years ago and something that happened five days ago blur together seamlessly in your dream and yet....... TO YOU..... it all makes perfect sense. It is more a representation of ideas (like a dream) than a linear story. And what you make of it really comes down to your personal interpretation of what it made you feel............ which may or may not be what Lynch intended you to feel in the first place.Perhaps his most poignant work since Blue Velvet, Mullholland Drive is a cinematic masterpiece from a director at the height of his craft. A riddle within a riddle. A paradox of perfection.Now you will see me one more time if you do good. You'll see me two more times if you do bad.

Bizarre that these two are the two Bond films vying for top spot as they are both a bit different as far as the plot goes. Here the entire world is in danger whereas in that one, they are only going after a decoding device which sank in a ship. While The Man with the Golden Gun features my favorite Bond villain in Scaramanga, this one features my favorite henchmen in Jaws, played by Richard Kiel. His Jaws is also one of the few bad guys to return in another film. Granted, Blofeld did as well, but I do not believe he was ever played by the same person twice. So this Bond film features a lot of action, a very attractive Bond girl and a very awesome henchman whose sheer size is intimidating enough, but then they add metal teeth to the equation! It all adds up to be one of the more fun Bond films ever and a film where the action almost never stops! The story has both a British and Soviet submarine going missing. Bond is the man sent to find out what happened to the British one, while a female Soviet agent codenamed XXX is the one who must find the Soviet. They begin their search in Egypt where they learn of a submarine tracking device, but there is more to this than mere missing subs. Seems a very rich man who has a very strong affinity to the sea is somehow responsible and it will take a joining of the two agents who work for opposing companies to find out what this man's ultimate goal is before it is too late! The villain here is pretty good, but Stromberg is just not as equal a foe to Bond as was Scaramanga. He is the villain who must rely heavily on others to get what he wants which is why he has two henchmen, though Jaws definitely was more up to the challenge than was Sandor. Roger Moore once again does great as Bond and Barbara Bach as XXX is absolutely stunning. She looked absolutely gorgeous at the end as her outfit got wet! This movie also features my favorite Bond vehicle, the Lotus. It is a very cool car and they actually have a rather cool chase before it plummets into the ocean where we learn of its other special functions. Just a lot of good things here as the story is much improved compared to the previous film which had great characters galore, but not the strongest story to bring it all together.So this is a favorite Bond film of mine.

This film was action sequence after action sequence, while take your typical comic film of today. Lots of people crying and doing nothing with maybe three action sequences at best. Yet these films apparently cost 200 million plus while this film has action and set pieces galore using more people and props because on cannot simply craft a special effect with a computer.

Roughly the first 90 minutes of this film are composed of footage from a 1999 TV movie that was to have served as a pilot for a proposed series on ABC. They apparently did not like what they saw, or perhaps felt that the story line --- small town girl goes Hollywood, meets bizarre characters, gets embroiled in mystery, was just a bit too odd for the sedated cop\/medical\/sitcom\/reality crowd. Either way the film languished in the vaults for over a year. Director David Lynch however, found a way to salvage his project --- simply tack on an hour of typically Lynchian sex and weirdness, then release it theatrically and hope that audiences worldwide would embrace it as a viable, multi-layered, groundbreaking work of art.Well, to me that sounds a bit like micro-waving a piece of old apple pie, serving it up with a large dollop of cherry vanilla ice cream and hoping no one notices. Recently there have been lots of user comments stating that the film's first half should be viewed as an extended dream, and its second half as actual reality. The problem with that interpretation is that it has been embraced 'after-the-fact' by viewers who think they see some artistic master plan on the director's part. This could not be further from the truth. The scenes from the pilot had been shot with no such thing in mind. Even if the dream angle was something Lynch was going for in the refurbished theatrical version, those early scenes still come off as too firmly grounded in reality to seem convincingly dreamlike. No, I don't buy this dream angle at all. In the end, I believe that the reason many of us are drawn to this movie is not because of the bland pie underneath, but rather the rich, intoxicatingly sweet ice cream that's been dumped atop it.Let's get down to brass tacks.  There are basically 2 reasons most of us are fascinated by this movie. First and foremost, the lesbian sex scenes. Make no mistake about it boys and girls, many of us in living in these modern, liberated times have come to appreciate the aesthetically titillating aspects of watching two beautiful women making love to each other. If you disagree with me, simply try imagining yourself being as enthralled with this movie as you currently are had 2 'guys' played the lead roles. Well, now that we've established (surprise) that sex sells, we should ask ourselves if that in itself makes something great art? I certainly don't think so, --- If it did, half the pornographic films out there would be considered works on par with CITIZEN KANE.Now for the second reason this film seems to fascinate us --- those amazingly disconcerting and typically surreal Lynchian moments that abound in the movie's final hour. Of all those moments, the most hauntingly memorable, in my opinion, is the scene at Club Silencio featuring the Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's Crying. Moments like that, coupled with the aforementioned scenes of sapphic bliss, build an atmosphere of brooding mystery and exotic sensuality that is quite alluring indeed.It should come as no surprise that those scenes were part of the new material shot to help sell the film theatrically. Unfortunately, they simply feel like colorful afterthoughts --- material that was never truly part of the director's original vision for the film. Knowing this, at least for me, makes the overall experience of viewing MULHOLLAND DRIVE somewhat less than satisfying. In the end, its a bummer to think that there was never truly an artistic intent on the director's part other than to salvage a failed project by injecting  moments of signature weirdness and steamy sex into it. Judging by the reviews on this site however, I'd say he'd managed to convince most of you otherwise.This film gets a  6 out of 10  because I have a 'soft' spot for David Lynch.

It and the Spy Who Loved me constantly via for the top spot in my mind. Sadly, this one did not perform as well as other Roger Moore James Bond movies as it did not do nearly as well as the previous film, Moonraker. I enjoyed this one more than Moonraker, which I did enjoy, but I felt it was a bit of a retread of The Spy Who Loved Me, while this one went in another direction by not having an eccentric wealthy person wishing to establish a new world order. At the same time, this one features action sequence after action sequence and location after location which made this one a fun romp. Perhaps it is the fact that this was not t he only Bond film released this particular year as Never Say Never Again featuring Sean Connery was put out the same year so it may have turned people off to see both. Me, I never cared to Never Say Never as it is simply a remake of Thunderball which is one of my favorite Sean Connery Bond movies. It and From Russia With Love via for the top spot for the Connery movies. I guess it matters little these days, and why should I care now that I alone think this is one of the best Bond films.The movie features a lot of action, but the mission is almost a rather unremarkable one. A spy ship is sunken with a mine and a decoder device that is on board is something that the Russians would love to have. The British have a man working on retrieving it, but he is promptly killed along with his wife in front of their daughter. James is sent in to find the hit-man responsible, but he soon finds a lot of people involved which takes him from one exotic location to another as he tracks down the one responsible for the death of the man charged with recovering the coding device. He will team up with the daughter whose parents were killed and soon try to salvage the device themselves; however, there is another who is after the device as well so he can sell it to the Russians.This one has so many action sequences in it that it goes by at supersonic speed. It opens with an action sequence in a helicopter that is unrelated to the decoding device plot, but it is fun to watch and the only time Blofeld and Roger Moore's Bond cross paths. There is an awesome car chase scene which features a very non typical Bond vehicle, a ski chase, a warehouse raid, a deep sea battle and a fight on a mountain monastery which has an awesome rock climbing scene. The Bond girls here are okay, just not as attractive as say Goodnight from Golden Gun or XXX from Spy. A lot of people complain about Bebe being to young for Roger, but he never shows any interest in her throughout the film so not sure why her character is criticized. She is just there to advance the plot in the Cortina portion of the film and to make Bond squirm a bit. The villain is good too as if you are watching it for the first time, you are not quite sure who the villain is until midway through the movie.So, no, this Bond is nothing like the previous two Bond movies which were very similar. Heck, it isn't even like Live and Let Die or Man with the Golden Gun either. It is not even like the next two Bond films. It stands on its own and is really fun to watch. I loved this one as a kid as it and Spy were tops for me at a young age too. This one I sometimes place on the top, because Spy is so similar to Moonraker; although, this one was supposed to follow Spy, but thanks to the space craze they decided to put Bond in space instead. I sometimes wonder had Moonraker not been made, if this film would have been vastly different as Jaws could very well had been in this one as he survived Spy and if there is no Moonraker where he turned good he could have showed up here to torment 007. So, while it is not apparently everybody's cup of tea, For Your Eyes Only stands near the top and is one of the more enjoyable and fast paced Bond films there is.

I guess it matters little these days, and why should I care now that I alone think this is one of the best Bond films.The movie features a lot of action, but the mission is almost a rather unremarkable one. A spy ship is sunken with a mine and a decoder device that is on board is something that the Russians would love to have. The British have a man working on retrieving it, but he is promptly killed along with his wife in front of their daughter. James is sent in to find the hit-man responsible, but he soon finds a lot of people involved which takes him from one exotic location to another as he tracks down the one responsible for the death of the man charged with recovering the coding device. He will team up with the daughter whose parents were killed and soon try to salvage the device themselves; however, there is another who is after the device as well so he can sell it to the Russians.This one has so many action sequences in it that it goes by at supersonic speed. It opens with an action sequence in a helicopter that is unrelated to the decoding device plot, but it is fun to watch and the only time Blofeld and Roger Moore's Bond cross paths. There is an awesome car chase scene which features a very non typical Bond vehicle, a ski chase, a warehouse raid, a deep sea battle and a fight on a mountain monastery which has an awesome rock climbing scene. The Bond girls here are okay, just not as attractive as say Goodnight from Golden Gun or XXX from Spy. A lot of people complain about Bebe being to young for Roger, but he never shows any interest in her throughout the film so not sure why her character is criticized. She is just there to advance the plot in the Cortina portion of the film and to make Bond squirm a bit. The villain is good too as if you are watching it for the first time, you are not quite sure who the villain is until midway through the movie.So, no, this Bond is nothing like the previous two Bond movies which were very similar. Heck, it isn't even like Live and Let Die or Man with the Golden Gun either. It is not even like the next two Bond films. It stands on its own and is really fun to watch. I loved this one as a kid as it and Spy were tops for me at a young age too. This one I sometimes place on the top, because Spy is so similar to Moonraker; although, this one was supposed to follow Spy, but thanks to the space craze they decided to put Bond in space instead. I sometimes wonder had Moonraker not been made, if this film would have been vastly different as Jaws could very well had been in this one as he survived Spy and if there is no Moonraker where he turned good he could have showed up here to torment 007. So, while it is not apparently everybody's cup of tea, For Your Eyes Only stands near the top and is one of the more enjoyable and fast paced Bond films there is.

It and the Spy Who Loved me constantly via for the top spot in my mind. Sadly, this one did not perform as well as other Roger Moore James Bond movies as it did not do nearly as well as the previous film, Moonraker. I enjoyed this one more than Moonraker, which I did enjoy, but I felt it was a bit of a retread of The Spy Who Loved Me, while this one went in another direction by not having an eccentric wealthy person wishing to establish a new world order. At the same time, this one features action sequence after action sequence and location after location which made this one a fun romp. Perhaps it is the fact that this was not t he only Bond film released this particular year as Never Say Never Again featuring Sean Connery was put out the same year so it may have turned people off to see both.

That said, Tomorrow Never Dies is, to me, the one major blemish in the series (I haven't seen Die Another Day yet).  Before today, this is the only James Bond movie I had not seen from start to finish.  The two times that I saw it in the theater I fell asleep.  The two times that I rented it, I fell asleep.  Having purchased it a long while ago, I figured it was rather ridiculous that I hadn't watched it yet (particularly since it was the only Bond I hadn't seen).  So to make a long story short, I finally watched it and, not to be too harsh, I know why I fell asleep on previous viewing attempts.To start with, the opening sequence which is quite pivotal in setting the tone for each Bond movie, was fairly limp.  While it was somewhat interesting, it was better suited for the Playstation game.  It just didn't have the punch of any of the other opening sequences (such as the fantastic boat chase in The World Is Not Enough just to name one).The other major flaw was the poorly conceived Elliot Carver villain character.  A media mogul?  Yeah, lets just move on.  Jonathan Pryce (who is fantastic in the likes of Ronin and Brazil) flounders trying to do something with nothing.  The effort ends up as a cross between a mad scientist from a 50's cheese sci-fi movie and a spoiled rich boy.  In other words, he over-acted to an extreme.  This is the only Bond villain that does not have a single facet of interest for me.Terry Hatcher, while she makes a worthy effort (well, for her it's a worthy effort) to be the scorned former lover, is simply out of place for the James Bond world.

Nowhere near same movies, but psychological emotional effect is same. Second time watching this film will be different experience.Story itself is being weaved together almost seamlessly. Shyamalan has certainly put a lot of thinking how to build up the story properly without taking compromises.

Not just as a child-actor but as an actor. Toni Collette as his mother does a good job too regardless of few mediocre scenes. Bruce Willis is just a slightly bit too self-sufficient in his acting, but does maybe one of the best roles of his career (12 Monkeys was pretty good too).
