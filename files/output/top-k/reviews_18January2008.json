His imagination and brilliance has reached us all on some emotional level. Of all Spielberg's films, Empire of the Sun seems to be his least known as well as highly underrated. It wasn't a blockbuster hit like his previous films Jaws, Close Encounters, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and E.T. Yet, Empire of the Sun is a huge hit with myself and many other fans who express their satisfaction with this film.Empire of the Sun is the story of Jim, a boy who grows up in the least desired circumstances. He grows up in the outbreak of World War II, in a foreign country, in chaos, and, most depressingly, without parents. Jim, an extraordinary character, must learn to survive in this new world. What seems to be a frightening experience, Jim not only survives, but he exceeds well at it. Of course, the pains of war take their toll on Jim which makes for a very heart-wrenching story told very well by Spielberg. Simply put, it is a story about a child's loss of innocence. It is a story of war seen through a child's eyes.Empire of the Sun is a film not fully appreciated as it should be. It deserves all the praise it is given. It was nominated for 6 Academy Awards, winner of 3 BAFTA awards from 6 nominations, and a Golden Globe nominee for Best Motion Picture and Best Original Score. It was given highest honors from the National Board of Review for Best Film of 1987 with Steven Spielberg receiving an NBR award Best Director, and Christian Bale was given a special NBR award for Best Juvenile Performance. With excellent direction from Spielberg, a very moving score from John Williams, and an unforgettable performance from the very young Christian Bale, Empire of the Sun makes for one of Spielberg's best. After seeing the film once, it became a personal favorite and an instant classic in my mind. Empire of the Sun is my personal favorite of all Spielberg's films, and I know after you see it you'll never forget it.

While trying to escape from his creditors, he has a flat tire and parks his car in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim). Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by Max, who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema, and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.Sunset Boulevard is a bitter and tragic masterpiece of the genius Billy Wilder that exposes how Hollywood uses people and forgets them when they get old and are considered decadent by the industry. Further, it also shows the consequences of the lack of adaptation of a former star to the end of a successful career, being forgotten by fans and the industry, and the price that some persons accept to pay to join this business.

It is the most powerful, moving and adorable film I have ever seen. So let me tell you how this film became my favorite of all-time On one side, the actors fit perfectly into the image of the city of love Paris. They are created for a non-existing dream world, where every single person has its place and love is around everywhere. On the other side, France's elementary culture subliminally manifests throughout the whole film. It is maybe just because of this fact that the movie abstains from the image of the modern city of Paris, which could eventually have destroyed the film's charisma. The viewer is somehow guided into several parallel worlds like the Montmartre café Deux Moulins, the trains of thoughts by Amélie or a world of an ill man, the glass-bone man. If you expect the movie to be made out of silk, then you are certainly on the wrong track. Amélie, who has never experienced luck and happiness in her life because her mother died when she was a little child, grows to an angelic figure over the time, trying to solve little grievances in the everyday life of other people. With sophisticated pranks against the mean ones and the support for the socially weak she achieves her aims to make world a better place. Her only problem is that she forgets to care about herself and her own life. She is not able to establish a real relationship because she is always forced to help others. On one day she gets to know her neighbor in the apartment house, the glass-bone man. He is one of the socially weak because he cannot leave his flat without the danger of breaking his bones. His everyday activity is to copy masterworks and to treat the stories of people he discovers in the paintings. It is him who helps Amélie breaking out and to work up the courage to meet a man she saw at the metro station and with whom she fell in love. Amélie is finally rewarded for all her efforts and justice takes its course...At the end of the movie, I could almost live the passion of the unselfish protagonist and emotions flew high. It is very rare that a film without a high degree of drama can touch my heart but this one could. It is the power of love that triumphs over the whole two hours the movie lasts. I regard this film not only as a story about people with love in their hearts; it is a statement to the world that Amélie actually has not succeeded to save the whole world although she could enlighten her small environment and this is what every person should and can do. I must honestly admit that I've eventually not understood the whole deep meaning behind it because there are so many small but important things in the movie that could be mentioned here.

The story is truly beautiful as we watch this young boy do whatever he can to enjoy life and free himself from the stranglehold of his parents and his school teacher. That being said, Antoine is certainly a human character. In attempting to escape from his parents, he has to do some terrible things. He steals and gets caught for it, spending a night in a prison cell.The final shot is one of the most beautiful and uplifting I've ever seen. I never imagined that the pure simplicity of a tracking shot following one boy running away to the beach could evoke so much emotion, but it made my heart swell up immensely. In fact the entire film is phenomenally shot. Some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. I found the entire picture incredibly relatable. Antoine's interactions with his parents felt so much like some of the experience I've had with my own in the past. It really felt like the scenes were taken right out of my past to the point of it being eerie. But that only helped me relate to Antoine even more.The young Jean-Pierre Léaud's performance is extraordinary. He completely became Antoine to the point where it was impossible to tell that he was even acting. It felt like we were just following this young boy and watching his natural reactions. This is a truly rare gift for actor's four times his age, so that just makes his work even more impressive. In short it's a simple, beautiful, poetic film with a great, relatable story and a phenomenal performance.

A lot of the material here deals with how big an idol Hank was to all the Jews in Amercia back then. I found that interesting, but I watched it simply because I love baseball, especially the old days and am thrilled to see footage of any Major League baseball games and stars from the first half of the 20th century. If there is a human-interest behind the diamond heroics, all the better! It's amazing the degree Greenberg was literally worshiped by the Jewish people make in the 1930s and 1940s.Greenberg was a likable guy and I enjoyed seeing him talk here and there from an interview he did in the early '80s, talking about his career. He isn't a braggart, but he's not that modest, either. He knew he was very good. He didn't make excuses either when he didn't accomplish he wanted, like hitting 60 homers one season. Sadly, some of the commentators like attorney Alan Dershowitz are not so unbiased. His paranoia is more than evident, claiming they didn't want a Jewish man breaking Ruth's record so they wouldn't throw strikes to him. That's proved a lie in the next minute when they show Cleveland ace Bob Feller striking him out several times in a late-season game as Hank was stuck at 58 and never made it to 60. To his credit, Greenberg said those claims were false, anyway.I enjoyed not only seeing Greenberg smash the ball but witnessing some of his famous and not-so-famous teammates in footage, too, and also interviewed in their older age - guys like Charlie Gehringer, a great second baseman on Hank's winning teams in Detroit.Greenberg was one of a number of great baseball players who gave up years of his ballplayer prime to serve in the military during World war II, as it is pointed out here. He left at the age of 31 and came back at 35.....and wound up hitting a grand slam in the bottom of the ninth to enable the Tigers to win the pennant! It might have been his greatest hit. The Tigers went on to cap off the season with a World Series win over the CubsThat's one reason (besides the recent steroids scandal) baseball records aren't as meaningful as people think. Guys like Greenberg and Boston's Ted Williams lost 4-5 years of their prime years in baseball. Who knows what their final totals would be had their been no war?I liked what Greenberg said near the end of this long documentary, something I wish more athletes of today would say (and believe) Ive tried to pattern my life on the fact that I'm out there in the limelight, so to speak, and that there are a lot of kids out there.

Actually, that is probably not the right term. It aggravated me. So much. I don't know how I mustered up the strength to finish watching it. The film gets better towards the ending though, so if you're brave enough to suffer through the first half, you'll be rewarded by a good murder scene at the end. The acting? I liked the two fathers (and their wives, a little less). The two girls made me mad a lot of the time. I found myself yelling at the screen and slapping my hands to my forehead too often. This happened especially when they would scream (which is endless in this movie) and cry, or make hurt faces. The only reason I gave this a four is because I enjoyed some of Jackson's shots. I should have filmed myself watching the movie, as my comments and facial expressions probably would have been much, much more entertaining. I recommend this movie wholeheartedly if you're in the mood to bitch to a screen for an hour and a half.

After visiting Old Tucson Studios I decided to watch a trilogy of movies made there The Three Amigos, Tombstone and Rio Bravo. The preserved movie sets have more of the flavor of the first (and more recent) two, but the surrounding mountains, the blue sky and the forlorn desert are the same for all. If you're a movie fan and visiting Tucson, I'd recommend seeing this.I have some reservations about recommending Rio Bravo, though. As Americana, as a campy experience, OK, but not as a great movie. Who wrote this thing? It seemed for a while like it could have been the Grateful Dead, but they didn't come into existence for several years after it was made. Dean Martin and Walter Brennan (aka Stumpy) are great, in a substance-abused sort of way - particularly WB's incoherent cackling and babbling. But the rest of the cast appears to be sleepwalking their way through what measures out at a little over 2-1\/2 hours length. With some cutting - let's just say this could have been a lot better. But Angie Dickinson is a bit too random, and John Wayne a bit too wooden to make this great.

When it was on TV a second time, I was like Ow yeah, Primal Fear! That movie's goooood! The introduction is very well written as directed as we get to know the main characters. I really liked Richard Gere's character, especially his intentions as a lawyer, which he quotes in the bar after getting drunk; thought-provoking words... Gere's acting in this film was better than his average performance. But the real star of this movie is definitely EDWARD NORTON!!! He makes you a slave to the screen and blows you away at the same time. I'm really frustrated by the fact he didn't win the Oscar here; he received a Golden Globe though... The story itself is good, very well worked out. Primal Fear is definitely worth the watch!
