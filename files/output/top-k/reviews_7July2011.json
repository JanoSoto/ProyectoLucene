Scott and Peter Doyle and the private eye. Hardcore was one of my favorite movies as a kid. Jism Jim and George C. had some great lines in the movie and it was seedy and scummy enough to inspire this 13 year old's imagination.Fast forward 25 years to last night, my old lady wanted to watch a thriller on the Roku and this one popped up so I caved in and watched it. You know what? This is how a remake should be done. The story is altered enough to make it fresh and new elements are added to boost the juice.The original Hardcore had the guy's runaway daughter get into drugs and porn and associating with a snuff film producer. George C. Scott takes over from the lame private eye and teams up with a peep show girl to traverse the sex trade underground in search of Rattan, the snuffer, and his daughter. Once he finds her, she is alive and it is over.In 8mm, Cage is the private dick trying to figure out if the girl on film is really dead and he teams up with a loser who works at an adult book store to traverse the seedy underground of the sex business. Of course the chick really is dead, but Cage finds the film makers and gets revenge for the snuffed teen. Also there is a twist with his client's lawyer being in on it and double crossing Cage. So this movie is similar to Hardcore but darker and with revenge, action and a lame twist thrown in.I've got to say that Schumacher must've found the scumiest locations in each city to shoot because man he made New York, LA, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh look like the most depressing places on the planet. Great acting by Gandolfini as the seedy and greedy producer and the guy who played Dino Velvet, ever so creepy and deranged.If you've been putting this off because you're a fan of Hardcore and think that this is just a straight remake, give it a look see. It is different enough from the original to be interesting and has some more elements to it.As far as the twist. It was lame and almost predictable. A better twist would have been to mimic the old movie and have the girl alive but all strung out and in love Dino and the Machine then having her kill Cage so that her mother never finds out where she is. Now that is a much better twist and in the spirit of the original film. But overall the movie was dark, depressing and good. Give it a chance.

Gene Wilder stars as Dr. Frederich Frankenstein, the grandson of the infamous Baron Von Frankenstein who created his monster which terrorized villagers years before. When Frederich inherits his grandfather's castle he stumbles upon the baron's work and sets out to create his own monster in the name of science. This film is what screwball comedy is all about. It is a uproariously hilarious ride that delivers one hilariously quotable line after the next.There is a right way and a wrong way to do screwball comedy. Mel Brooks knows the right way and he hits it right on the nose with Young Frankenstein. The absurdity and silliness of this film never feels out of place and it always fits just right with the pacing of the film. This is a very goofy and off the wall kind of film but there's something about it that is just so damn funny. I would have to say it starts with the eccentric cast of characters all played to perfection by their actors. Gene Wilder plays up the mad scientist cliché just enough to where it becomes a joke in and of itself, spoofing the mad scientist stereotype just right. Marty Feldman plays Igor in what is possibly the most hilarious role in the entire film. From hitting on Frankenstein's fiancée to having his hump switch shoulders constantly everything he says and does makes me laugh.The two female leads are also hysterical. Madeline Kahn is so incredibly over the top, yet a lot of her humor is subtle, at least as subtle as any screwball humor gets. Teri Garr plays Inga, who has the most ridiculous German accent, making every last thing she says a joke. Cloris Leachman even has a small role as Frau Blucher, a role that is almost more creepy than it is funny. Then of course Peter Boyle plays the monster in a Frankenstein performance to rival Boris Karloff. It's the nuttiest portrayal of the creature ever but his scenes are some of the funniest of the entire film. The absence of Mel Brooks as a character in the film was a little disappointing but there's nothing to be done about that.You have to go into Young Frankenstein with a very open mindset because it is incredibly nonsensical and ridiculous, just like any great screwball comedy. If you waste time questioning the logic of this film one, you will make an idiot out of yourself, and two, you won't be able to enjoy the film nearly as much. This is one of the silliest films ever made, as is to be expected from Mel Brooks, but it is incredibly fun and you won't see a spoof pulled off nearly as well as this in a long, long time.

He's the make-or-break actor in this movie, and I believe he did an incredible job in a very tough role, all the tougher when you consider that much of what he did involved acting on a green screen stage. He makes you love him while at the same time you want him to not be such a perfect loving child because you know he's going to get hurt-- even though that shouldn't be possible, and shouldn't matter since he's not human. Should it?It has Jude Law in a part that seems in some ways almost a throw-away to the plot of the movie, but that is done so well it stays with you. I find Jude Law an incredibly charismatic actor with great versatility and unexpected talents; as Gigolo Joe the adult entertainment mecha, he's incredible, capering and literally dancing from appointment to appointment, both impersonal and incredibly personally intimate as the perfect love machine-- literally.It has some incredible special effects that create new and believable times and places that make you want to explore them further when the movie ends. To me, that's one of the tests of a movie's successfulness does it take me to a place where I can immerse myself in an alternate reality that isn't awkward or jarring? This movie does that-- sometimes.It is visually in many ways a stunning movie in its concepts and their execution.That's the good stuff. The not-so-good stuff it isn't cohesive enough in plot and story for the viewer to really understand what it's about.On one level, it's the Pinocchio story, updated and explored from a slightly different angle. You have the puppet who is made so real that ultimately he wants to be real, and cannot stand the pain of knowing he isn't a real boy. And he goes through his odyssey like Pinocchio, in a series of adventures like Pinocchio had, that carry lessons\/information he needs to assimilate or to show how in his imperfection as a puppet trying to be a boy, he's in some ways more perfect than the real thing.On another level, it's an exploration of the pain and love of the parent\/child relationship, and the power of that connection, particularly the connection between mother and child, and whether there can be, or should be, a surrogate for a real child when a real child isn't available.And on a very superficial level, it's something of a morality play about how imperfect humans behave savagely when confronted by the perfection of machines that are programmed to be people who are more perfect than people ever can be.And it's all interesting, in an episodic way, but it doesn't fit together. It's like riding in a car with a manual transmission and a driver who hasn't figured out how to coordinate the controls yet. It moves forwards in fits and starts and with much lurching and grinding of gears, and occasionally the engine is roaring at full throttle while the wheels aren't going anywhere.I enjoyed this movie while at the same time feeling great frustration. It didn't deliver me to the destination it seemed headed for and the ride there was occasionally very bumpy and unpleasant. But the scenery at times was astounding, and the actors delivered performances that made me willing to forgive a lot.But in the end, I think many people will find this movie too flawed for pure entertainment. If you want to sit down cold and watch a movie that takes you from beginning to end with a smooth flow of events and impetus that's always moving in the direction it promises, you are not going to feel this movie delivers. But you may, at the same time, feel glad you watched it anyway.I particularly enjoyed the ending, which is about wish-fulfillment and finally finding that perfect, unflawed, unconditional happiness and shared love, even if it took more than a thousand years of waiting and the end of mankind to get there, and it only lasted for a day. It was the realization that maybe a single day of perfection in love makes a thousand years or more of darkness and stasis and the collapse of everything around you into chaos worthwhile. Maybe if you have the faith to believe that that kind of love is possible, and you get it for a single day, it cancels out all the pain and unbearableness of what's come before it. Wouldn't it be nice to believe in a world that eventually makes everything right and wonderful and worthwhile in one day, one stunningly perfect day that meets your expectations unconditionally and flawlessly?It's a sweet thought and a sweet ending, but it's unsatisfying because the way that Osment's Pinocchio achieves his single perfect day, we know it's really an illusion arranged for him out of pity and an abstract curiosity by literal alien entities that observe it all with a sense of detachment as a sort of laboratory experiment. In the end it isn't real even though it is, because it happened through deus ex machina. Does that count?I've watched this film several times now and there are parts of it that are so good that it frustrates me that in the end, the parts are better than the movie as a whole. So I say if you're looking for a straightforward entertainment movie that takes a story and tells it well and smoothly, you aren't going to like A. I. Artificial Intelligence. But if you're the kind of viewer who can forgive the picture's overall flaws because you're happy that there are some incredible parts, I think you'll be glad you spent the time with this movie.

Sylvester Stallone play's a somewhat clichéd, out of control Sergeant called Deke DaSilva, with a typically cooler minded sidekick, Matthew Fox, played by the often excellent Billy Dee Williams. We see gun fights, chases, and the heat and tension sure builds up in the way that good action movies do, but that's the problem with 'Nighthawks', it should not just be a simple action film. If Stallone hadn't been allowed to be so hands on in this movie, we could have perhaps had some scene's explaining 'Wolfgars' past, what drove him to badly hurt and murder people, as it is, his back story is left somewhat ambiguous, and as a result, we have no other character's to be interested in other than Stallones. Quite frankly, discovering why a terrorist travels the globe to kill for a cause he believes so strongly in, is a much more interesting proposition than watching Sergeant DaSilva argue with his wife about never having time for her, and if Stallone had the gut's to really make a serious movie about terrorist's, then 'Nighthawks' could've been a much better movies than the one we got. I feel sorry for Rutger Hauer here, he could really have brought something fantastic to his role had his back story permitted it.

They really pulled off a believable Spider-Man film that does justice to the spirit of the comics and character. Spider-Man is a film that audiences young and old to enjoy, with it's dazzling action sequences, humorous lines and a well-written and exciting plot.Sam Raimi, known for his cult Evil Dead films and the underrated but brilliant Darkman gives the character so much in traits and personality, wit, that it's hard to imagine anyone else that can deliver a Spider-Man film. More often than not, I think this film is a great example how much hard work and devotion is done to make sure that this film is a success. True, some of the shots seem artificial, but what viewers should really focus on is the story and characters, something that moviegoers sometimes fail to do. And with a script like this, you will be too.Like Richard Donner's Superman another film done right, Spider-Man spends a considerable time on the origins of Peter Parker, who is motivated to use his powers for good due to a tragedy in his life. But whereas Superman was brought up to do good by his parents and the values he learned on his time on Earth, Spider-Man was struck by circumstance, both by his surroundings and his personal tragedy. These characters are completely different from each other. But what makes Spider-Man so compelling than Superman is that he's an average, ordinary guy with everyday problems that one day becomes blessed(and to a certain extent, cursed) with an extraordinary gift. His reaction is that of joy and excitement that is shared by everyone in this world when they find themselves doing extraordinary actions. Though not in no way in the context of the real world, but the point still stands. And lets face it we all like to be superheroes some day. Spider-Man gives us the feeling of living out those fantasies in more ways than one.To make a great superhero film, or any film for that matter, you have to have strong actors and Tobey Maguire is by far the best choice for the film. He's really believable as a guy who is shunned by his pears but still is kind-heart and meek, bright. You grow to care for Peter, Mary Jane, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and Norman Osborne. When a film makes you care for the characters, then you know it's good. As for the action scenes, they are thrilling, exciting, and at times, very brutal. Even though Spider-Man is a bit light-hearted and fun, it can be really intense and scary, which parents ought to be cautious when seeing these films with their children. But despite all this, Spider-Man is still good fun.Now that a reboot is being planned, I'm very excited to see what's next for the Web-Slinger even though I enjoyed the first film along with the second(which I will review later on).

But when a patient called Prot is allocated to him for diagnosis with an introduction 'Like a pussy cat', he finds himself quite involved more than usual. Prot claims that he comes from a planet called K-Pax and he is on a mission. While the good doctor tries to unfold the true identity of this mysterious 'alien' he finds himself amusingly bonding with him. As Prot is very through and informative on his side of the story Dr. Mark finds it challenging to make an influence on Prot with usual medical practices. Furthermore Prot starts to convince other patients in the hospital that he is a K-Paxian and the other patients begin to create a fan group around him. And on top of all that there is a certain curiosity within the intelligent members of some areas if Prot is actually who he says him to be as he poses some great knowledge which is still unknown to many. K-Pax is a movie which has very little ups and downs in the mood. It almost runs in a mid phase throughout. There is neither loud music nor moments of thrill unless there is one which last only few seconds rarely. And the whole movie is like a big conversation that happens between two people. And these two characters dominate the whole movie and without knowing we become witnesses to a medical investigation. Jeff Brdiges (Dr. Powell) and Kevin Spacey (Prot) makes a wonderful pair and simply strong in their character representation. They have totally different two ends to their roles and how they try to connect it together is simply fascinating. I must say that along with this lovely performance the plot works very uniquely without making the viewer bored. Having a dramatic and scientific background to it K-Pax always keeps a step ahead of the mind of the viewer. The story is completely unpredictable and much untold.

However as it is such a highly regarded film, I thought it was probably worth watching, even if I wasn't going to enjoy it. Why I knew I wasn't going to enjoy it; it won six ocars but other films that were also released that year have since become more well loved (e.g. pulp fiction, the shawshank redemption), I'm not a really big fan of Tom Hanks as an actor (shock horror!) and Robert Zemeckis is definitely my least favourite director, creating films that (in my opinion anyway) have no real aim other than to make some cash. So how did it compare to my pre-judgements? Just as I thought really. There were many problems I found in this movie; to start with the camera angles and the camera movement made the film hard to look at visually, as the people and object moving looked very unnatural. Another problem is that aside from Forrest, all of the characters seem one dimensional as they were all extremely underwritten. Leading on from that, for me, the script is a major problem; the dialogue is incredibly tedious, every line made me sigh with frustration, but that isn't the main problem with the dialogue; I watched the film with friends and every few seconds I heard them laughing at the things Forrest says, however that's something I couldn't get into, I felt that there is something very malicious about laughing at a man with some kind of mental handicap. Though the dialogue isn't the only problem with the script, the whole story is beyond unrealistic. Although it isn't unlikely for someone to drift through life and for things to just happen to them, it is unlikely for the majority of them to be such good and life changing things, especially for a man with a mental disability, from a non-privileged background, at this time period. I also find it a little bit sneaky that they never mention what is wrong with Forrest, it seems to be they did this so they could include some parts of the plot, for example him having sex with Jenny and they her having a child, that I doubt would happen in real life to people in his condition. However, none of this is exactly enraging for me, the only thing that really makes my blood boil, is the Vietnam sequence. Films that have been made about the Vietnam war have been made with the soul purpose to let audiences know, that war is hell and war will destroy you, but Forrest's narration tells us that his experience in Vietnam was fun, which goes against everything films like Platoon, The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now stand for and aside from a few seconds of footage, nothing shows the horrors of the war, it's unrealistic and highly insulting to the people who fought in the war. Though as I have given it 3\/10, there obviously must be a few plus points, there are about three. The effects that put Forrest in with archive footage and very well done and well edited, Gary Sinise is very good in an underwritten part, the fact he didn't win an Oscar is a travesty and there are some huggable children in it.

Though as I have given it 3\/10, there obviously must be a few plus points, there are about three. The effects that put Forrest in with archive footage and very well done and well edited, Gary Sinise is very good in an underwritten part, the fact he didn't win an Oscar is a travesty and there are some huggable children in it. Though that doesn't make up for the obvious flaws in this movie.

It's about a man named Ricci, who just got a job in a post-War unemployment-stricken Roma. The community's hopelessness weakened its fraternal spirit as illustrated by these human queues protesting when only one's got a job. And that day seems to be Ricci's day  he will start working as a hanger-poster, all he needs is a bicycle. Having just pawned his, Ricci's reaction quickly betrays him, but from the crowd's opportunistic cries, he realizes he'd better shut his mouth and do the best to get his bicycle back.The film relevantly alternates between social commentary and family drama, through a powerful depiction of the solidarity that could only prevail within the family in these times. The wife, Maria, without hesitation strips the sheets from the marital bed  they would replace the bicycle in the pawn shop. The never ending shot of the man climbing the ladder full of other used sheets, is a strong reminder of the hardship endured in these days where even sheets were secondary.In another interesting scene, Ricci waits for Maria who visits a Wise Woman. Impatiently enthusiastic, he joins her upstairs while asking two kids to watch the bicycle. Maria came to pay for the prediction that Ricci would get a job, but he prevents her from 'wasting her money', as a practical man. However, when you measure the length of the human queue that visits the Wise woman, you understand how far from practicality people could be pushed by despair, while superstition was the only guidance one could seek. Ricci didn't need that, he had a job. On many levels, the scene is interesting, as we wonder if Ricci's intervention could have foreshadowed the theft, expecting from the title and the misleading cheerful mood, that the bicycle would be stolen when he'll come downstairs. But this would have been too predictable.The following day, Ricci rides his bicycle, carrying a ladder. Every time we get to see him on a bicycle, there's a sensation of freedom, driven by an exhilarating fast motion. But fate chose Ricci as the unfortunate victim of a meticulously set-up stealing. We only have a quick glance on the thief, but Ricci's reaction sweeps it off, and sets up the dramatic element that will never desert the film. Ricci knows what this terrible loss means. He comes back by bus, ignoring the queue, and peoples' protests. The next day, starts a long quest for the stolen bicycle with Ricci and his son, Bruno, a plucky funny-looking little boy, who makes the duo look like a dramatic reminiscence of Chaplin and his Kid, with a new father-and-son dimension that will be the heart of the film.And in this journey that immortalized the Roma that was just healing its War hounds, queues take a particular significance as an allegory of Ricci's condition a man isolated in his own despair struggling against a system that makes an outcast of him, or worse, an agitator. In a church, Ricci 'harasses' the only man he previously flashed with the stealer, unluckily frail and old. After a long unsuccessful search, Ricci almost wisely resigns and takes Bruno to the restaurant. For a brief moment, Ricci smiles again and lets Bruno drink a few wine. The restaurant scene represents a pivotal moment when Bruno realizes his personal contrast with the richer kid who can eat spaghetti, and Ricci reconsiders with a mathematical precision how providential and indispensable were the job and the bicycle.Ricci's only chance is superstition, an euphemism for luck. Find it now, or it'll be lost forever the Wise Woman implacably says. And in an unpredictable twist, Ricci meets the thief, right after the visit and he's the one, as his defensive reaction shows. Ricci violently gets him off a brothel, with the fierceness of a man who won't let his prey escape. De Sica's direction is masterful as it makes Ricci, following the tragic irony that governed his journey, look like a bully to the people of the neighborhood and the epileptic stroke of the suspected kid made Ricci even more detestable.Ricci endured hostility, he lost his bicycle and his pride, he faces a situation where his heart is full of hatred and where he has nothing to lose. If a thief can get through this, so be it. Tortured by his conscience, he finally asks Bruno to take the tram and steals a bicycle parked in a cleared place. But this is not Ricci's day at all, and the climactic sequence after making my heart pound, literally melted it when the by-standers stopped Ricci and started treating him like a bug, with the sad and tear-jerking cries of poor Bruno that saved him from jail, but not from the insults.De Sica deliberately hired non-professionals as to amplify the film's neo-realistic aspect.

Someone objected to most Star Trek films on the irrelevant grounds that practical interstellar travel may well be impossible for many reasons. Overall ratings for U-571 at some online sites suffer from the same sort of misplaced criticism.FIRST OBSERVATION The film's aim was entertainment--never realism. If you want the latter, see Das Boat and--best of all--Downfall. You can equal criticize the Die Hard and Dirty Harry series as unrealistic (true) and you would be making the same mistake .

The movie deals with two sisters--sensible Elinor Dashwood (Emma Thompson) and carefree Marianne (Kate Winslet). Elinor falls for nice Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant) but his family feels she's beneath them. Old but kind Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman) falls for Marianne but she falls for young dashing John Willoughloy (Greg Wise). Many complications occur.The movie is too long (over 2 hours) and sometimes TOO quiet but I was truly never bored and loved it--with reservations. It was nominated for 7 Academy Awards and won for Best Screenplay for Emma Thompson (well deserved). It looks beautiful, is well-directed by Ang Lee and has a beautiful music score. Almost all the acting is top notch--except for two people. Grant is WAY too mannered in his role...but he's not in the picture much. Same with Thompson. She's not horrible but she's ALWAYS quiet and controlled. Just once I wanted to see her break loose--but I guess Austen heroines aren't allowed to do that. Also Rickman was cast against type as a loving man--and pulled it off beautifully. If you don't like costume dramas stay far away from this but everybody else should love it. A must for romantics. I give it an 8. ","genre":null},{"date":"7 July 2011","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Based on a novel by Jane Austen.

The character of Fiona (played by Jeni Courtney) is like every free and beautiful little girl that you've ever encountered rolled into one. She has such a wonderful outlook on life; honest and serious, faithful and fanciful. This is an improbable film for director John Sayles, an American filmmaker who usually sticks much closer to home. More pleasing still is the fact that he takes an honest, unfiltered view of the Irish culture that is so intrinsic to the story being told.The Secret of Roan Inish is about storytelling, from an inner and outer perspective. Each character is deeply concerned with sharing his or her own tale or take on local folklore. The script takes all sorts of beautiful sidelines into the tales of Fiona's relatives and anyone else who happens to pass by. Particularly fascinating is the performance of John Lynch, whose character tells the legend of the Selkie (played by his sister, Susan Lynch). The images of the seal woman are breathtaking, painful in their uncertain waking beauty.The final result of the film is something between the purity of childhood and the trust of self. I was taken in not only by the overwhelming sense of the unknown, but by everything fearful and wonderful in the making known of the same. This is one of the most enrapturing motion pictures I've ever seen.
