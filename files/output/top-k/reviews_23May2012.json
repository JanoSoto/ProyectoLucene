Nine months later and you are introduced to a string of random events.

No effort has been made to make any element of the later part of the movie credible. Making $7000 on the first night seems a cakewalk, but $8000 in two more nights an impossible task for no apparent reason. Towards the end of the movie was the much awaited showdown, match with Teddy KGB (John Malkovich, only one who does his part well) but it turns out to be the nail in the coffin instead. You'd find more surprise and tension in a local club poker match than in this one. The cocksure hero is expected to win and he does without a glitch.The End.

She accidentally wishes him away to the Goblin King Jareth who will keep Toby as his newest goblin if Sarah does not complete his Labyrinth in 13 hours.I first saw the film in my early teens when my parents bought the movie on laser disc. Today I'm not much of a fan of the muppets or musicals. I get restless and impatient, shifting and rolling my eyes. Yet even now I can take in the joy and boundless energy the muppets and music provided to Labyrinth. An integral part of the story and setting you can't separate one from the other and it be the same movie. So not only is this my favorite film from my teens, it's also my #1 muppet movie and #1 musical.I loved the choices she had to make in the first half of the movie. She tried the lipstick to mark her way &#x96; it didn't work but it was really smart. Every obstacle she tried thinking about it and using whatever she came up with as best she could. The logic puzzles seamlessly worked with the idea of a labyrinth and having to maneuver through a foreign place.David Bowie enchanted as a stony-faced villain king set on seducing a young girl in any way he could manage. The choice of making the glass- ball juggling act part of the character's mystery and allure worked, characterizing in such a visual way. I think he represented all the darker, more worldly choices a girl can make but in a way that is non- threatening to parents yet still calls to a teenager.Anyone with a sibling, especially a younger sibling, can totally relate to Sarah Williams. As a child you are still trying to figure out the right and wrongs of situations. Many times it is not until you've already done something that you realize it was wrong to do. Sarah made a situation like this feel sincere and believable. David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly played off one another very well, the age difference wasn't an issue and it could have been rather creepy.Two of my favorite characters are Hoggle, a dwarf with a penchant for cheap jewelry and Ludo, a gentle giant whom Sarah rescues from being tortured by goblins. They are such polar opposites that they made the perfect traveling companions. When Hoggle first betrayed Sarah I was more heartbroken and hurt than mad and angry. And the fact Ludo could call rocks to him just seemed to fit who the creature was. For a bag of fur and a plastic mask on a stick they made these two feel real and significant.Production wise I think they balanced between the plot which I love, the music which added mystery and allure and the muppets which added character and energy. If not done just so the whole thing could have been a cheesy mess. I think this says a lot about who was behind the film. Henson knew how to utilize his puppets in a way that made them relevant in the story. Lucas understood storytelling and that each element mattered. David Bowie's songs in particular fit the subject and tone of the film to perfection. The writers really helped the balance because the plot worked and made a great background on which to hang the music and muppets. It's this kind of balance that writers everywhere are attempting to achieve in their own writing. To make what potentially are the weaknesses (the music and muppets) into strengths really show how expertly this movie was produced.The two best scenes in the film have all to do with the writing though. The first when Jareth takes Sarah to the ball and she's an honest to goodness princess. And the second, a scene following when Sarah's back in her room around all her belongings that make her feel safe. Such a one &#x96; two punch. The first tried to suck her in with her hopes and dreams, the hopes and dreams any young teenager has about the future. Perhaps unrealistic ideals though. Then Jareth follows up with total reality and the safety the present provides. It's everything you know and want to hold on to so you don't have to face the future. Both, equally could suck her in and Jareth would win. It's this kind of struggle we want to see for our characters whether as a writer or as the audience.As a teenager you are in a struggle between your hopes and desires and the reality of real life. Coming to terms with where you fall as an individual is when you really grown up. Even at my age this movie hits a core place inside me when I watch it again because it shows and reminds you of the decisions you've made to get where you are today.Read more of my reviews at http\/\/yaykisspurr.wordpress.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"23 May 2012","score":"","review":" 15-year-old Sarah is struggling with the existence of her baby half- brother, Toby.

The adventurous, action packed movie, The adventures of Huck Finn takes place in the fictional town of Saint Petersburg, Mississippi. The main characters were Huck played by Elijah Wood, Jim played by Courtney B. Vance, The duke played by Robbie Coltrana, The king played by Jason Robards, Pap Finn played by Ron Perlman, Widow Douglas played by Dana Ivey, Mary Jane Wilks played by Anne Heche, and Deputy Hines played by James Gammon. I think the cast of the movie was bad at acting because, for the most part, they didn't really own their roles. In the movie, Huck was talking to a black man named Jim who could see the future, and the man told Huck that Pap was coming back to town and told him he needed to run away that night. Instead, Huck decided to sneak out with his friends one last time and when he got back Pap was in his room and grabbed him and ran off taking him back to his place. Pap got drunk and tried killing Huck and when he woke up the next morning Pap left to go into town and Huck climbed through the fire place and went and killed a goat and dragged it through Pap's place and to fake his own death. Then Huck ran off to Jackson County because no one lives there and he runs into Jim. They start to swim in a pond and Jim tells Huck he's running off because he found out Widow Douglas was going to sell him to someone in New Orleans, so he was going to run down the Mississippi river to become a free man and earn money to buy his family back. On their way down the river Huck and Jim run into a lot of adventures. These two men hopped on Huck's and Jim's raft and at their next stop the two men found out that Jim was a runaway slave and they blacked mail them by saying they would tell the cops on them or kill them, unless they did as they said. You need to watch the movie for yourself to find out the rest. In the movie I thought the directing wasn't very good. The directing just kept going from one thing to the next. For example after Huck and Jim started down the river Huck changed his mind and wanted to tell on Jim and they run into police then he changes his mind and doesn't want to tell on him so he makes up a huge story about his mom and sister having pox. Then that night a steam boat crashes into Huck's and Jim's raft and then some men grabbed Huck and took him back to their house where the mother and son said he could stay as long as he wanted. In this movie I think the director should have added a few more scenes that showed the building of the friendship between Huck and Jim because I never got to really actually see that between them in the movie. Mark Twain started the realism era in literature. Realism is the use of everyday life and putting it into prose. He showed slavery and how some slaves would run away to free land. Jim ran away from Widow Douglas because he overheard that she was selling him to someone in New Orleans so he left and started down the Mississippi river to free land. Mark Twain also showed stereotypes and how everyone believed slavery was a good thing. Since Disney likes everything to have a happy ending the only real part in the movie that made us feel bad about slavery was when Jim got whipped and they showed the slashes on his back. If you want to know what Huck learned about Slavery at the end of the movie you will need to go watch it for yourself. I would give this movie one star, I think it's a boring movie and doesn't have good directing. It's just about a boy who runs into the wrong people and what he goes through once he meets them. It also just goes from one thing to the next and doesn't really have a calming point or show the friendship of Huck and Jim. The only way that I would rent the movie is if I read the book and wanted to see it to understand it better, otherwise I would advise you not to go see it.

Some of the stars were Elijah wood as Huck, Courtney B. Vance as Jim, and Ron Perlman as pap Finn. Elijah Wood or Huck is a thirteen year old boy who comes from a poor background and has been raised up to this point, by his uneducated, uncivilized, drunkard father. The story takes place in Mississippi during pre-civil war times. Widow Douglas and Miss Watson have taken him in and are attempting to civilize him. Courtney B. Vance or Jim is a black slave that ends up running away with Huck when he runs away because he caused his fake death to get away from his father. Jim is caring, One of Miss Watson's household slaves. Jim is superstitious and occasionally sentimental, but he is also intelligent, practical, and ultimately more of an adult than anyone else in the movie. Huck's father, the town drunk is a wreck when he appears at the beginning of the movie, with disgusting, ghostlike white skin and tattered clothes. but he sure did act like he cared when he went looking for Huck's fake killer after Huck had put pig blood all over and trashed his pap's house to make it look like someone had brutally murdered him. and that is when the whole adventure begins, when he runs away with Jim he finally has a way to to leave without having to worry about anyone looking for him. he is finally free to do what he wants. i choose to discuss acting as my aspect of filmmaking, because i think that it is a very well done act. when Huck had gotten shot but he acted like he was fine when Jim asked him why he was being so slow, another example is when he told that big long lie and the doctor did not believe him and he just thought he was a good liar. My overall reaction to the film is that it was a very well thought out and well wrote movie that always had new surprises planned for the viewer. I think that the quality of the movie was really good it had funny parts to it and a few sad parts. the graphics were pretty good and i think that it would be a great movie for a family looking for something to do to watch. I give it 4 out of 5 stars.

Huck's father, the town drunk is a wreck when he appears at the beginning of the movie, with disgusting, ghostlike white skin and tattered clothes. but he sure did act like he cared when he went looking for Huck's fake killer after Huck had put pig blood all over and trashed his pap's house to make it look like someone had brutally murdered him. and that is when the whole adventure begins, when he runs away with Jim he finally has a way to to leave without having to worry about anyone looking for him. he is finally free to do what he wants. i choose to discuss acting as my aspect of filmmaking, because i think that it is a very well done act. when Huck had gotten shot but he acted like he was fine when Jim asked him why he was being so slow, another example is when he told that big long lie and the doctor did not believe him and he just thought he was a good liar. My overall reaction to the film is that it was a very well thought out and well wrote movie that always had new surprises planned for the viewer. I think that the quality of the movie was really good it had funny parts to it and a few sad parts. the graphics were pretty good and i think that it would be a great movie for a family looking for something to do to watch. I give it 4 out of 5 stars.

Some of the stars were Elijah wood as Huck, Courtney B. Vance as Jim, and Ron Perlman as pap Finn. Elijah Wood or Huck is a thirteen year old boy who comes from a poor background and has been raised up to this point, by his uneducated, uncivilized, drunkard father. The story takes place in Mississippi during pre-civil war times. Widow Douglas and Miss Watson have taken him in and are attempting to civilize him. Courtney B.

Not long after moving in Rosemary suffers a horrific physical assault that leaves her a shadow of her former self she's given a dreadful pixie haircut by Vidal Sassoon that makes her look like a young David Bowie. Oh, and she gets knocked up by Satan as well.Roman Polanski's faithful adaptation of Ira Levin's bestseller Rosemary's Baby is an unmissable treat, a slow-burn classic of the Satanic horror sub-genre that builds inexorably to its chilling climax with class and style, never resorting to cheap scare tactics (which some might find surprising given that producer William Castle is renowned for his schlock horror B-movies).Polanski's approach is all about the foreboding atmosphere and mounting tension, building slowly on the sense of dread first triggered by a potted history of the infamous Bramford Building (given by Rosemary's friend Hutch) with a series of bizarre incidences that eventually have Rosemary believing that her neighbours are witches aiming to steal her as-yet unborn baby. Of course, Rosemary is not far wrong but Polanski cleverly toys with his audience right to the finish, almost having us doubt her sanity towards the end despite all that we have seen.Barring a brief glimpse of a bloody corpse&#x97;a suicide victim who hits the sidewalk with a splat&#x97;the film is totally devoid of gore, but even if you usually prefer your horror drenched in red, this effective chiller still comes highly recommended.
