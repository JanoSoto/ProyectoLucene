He is usually able to build his films world around very contained environments, both in time and in space. Even in Saturday Night Fever this device was visible, in a subtle way there we had a film that was about an era, a certain youth, in a certain portion of the world we can talk about time and space container in a pop culture sense. WarGames was also about this, chasing time was the excuse to increase tension, and build cinematically the suspense mood. Here we have the same premises as in WarGames, a guy has to do something in a short amount of time, otherwise something terrible will happen. The terrible thing to happen and the action he must fulfill are all located around the same city block, so all the development will move around that.Here Badham has a stronger element, comparing to WarGames he has Depp. We're looking at one of the best current actors, here in a time where he was (even) more than today a risk taker. He tried many things, here is another one. Just looking at Depp is reason enough to watch this. He is one of the few actors who can carry alone the hole audience to make believable what might be questionable, and deepen his performance with the over layering of inner questions, here mostly associated with whether he should complete his mission or try to abort it his daughter vs doing the right thing. It's rather repetitive material, but the question with Depp (and great actors) is never on What but on How.I could not stop wondering what De Palma could have done here. 3 years after this one, he directed his very personal Snake Eyes, one of his essays on cinematic eye behavior\/movement. There, De Palma's cinematic sensibility was collecting the fruits of his careers experiments in moving camera and eye work, but all the rest was so lame, acting, even some scriptwriting (all the writing that wasn't under de Palma's preoccupations) that the experience lost something. That same improved script with Depp could have thrown it yet to another level. Pity Anyway, John Badham is competent enough to make this worthwhile, and he can move around. Walken is (as usual) over the top, he is the tough smart with words guy, has usually good recognition from the audiences, but he is not what i enjoy. Nevertheless overall this is a good experience.

Old time lovers - Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Lisa (Ingrid Bergman), meet after many years in Casablanca and remember their love in France. Lisa was and is wife of Victor (Paul Henreid) and the couple is planning to run away to America through Casablanca. Rick - now the owner of the most popular club in Casablanca is well connected among corrupt military and government machinery - sacrifices his love and helps the couple duo to go to America.It is the not the story in itself, but the way it is told that makes it a very interesting viewing. The pace is fast and engrossing. The story slowly unfolds and never lets the viewers guess the next till the very end. There is a sense of mystery and suspense. The backbone of the movie is a love story that has gone wrong. It connects with every audience. The misery and cynicism of Rick is so real that every man may feel a close resemblance to the feeling Rick is having. Though many, there are well itched characters that define the intent and purpose of their words and actions. The characters &#150; mostly representing different European countries &#150; and give an universal appeal to western audiences, and so I understand its relevance in people's mind and popularity.The character of Rick is brilliantly played by the chain smoking king Bogart.

Lee's films aren't linear films in any sense of the word you can break them up into plot point and annoying spiel between two characters. The crappy DV cinematography of this only underlines how amateurish Lee's film-making...sorry, I almost said style....methods are. Who needs to craft a movie into making anybody with an opposing view step into another's shoes to understand the point when you can just throw the LA Riots, 9\/11, or the Million Man March and get some attention from that? Hence we come to the great problem with Bamboozled. We are being told--since Lee doesn't have the ingenuity to allow a bit of ambiguity in his films--by a man who made Nike commercials with Michael Jordan that all of us are racist because we indulge in stereotypes. But not like the stereotypes that Lee uses in every single one of his movies to shove his points. No, stereotypes are bad until the filmmaker latches onto something very public and fills his script with them in order to make a movie which all of us are supposed to pay for so we can hear what he thinks. Does Spike Lee want to make movies, or does he want attention so he can speak out about something that happened? One can't imagine but think that Lee just wants the respect of being paid attention to, but can't muster the talent that he had once to make it worth our time. In short, Lee had a good idea for a movie. And then he threw it away because he simply doesn't have any idea on how to make an effective movie and wants the easy way out of speaking his mind and letting it end at that. Any doubters? Well, they're not there. Introspection is only reserved after one side has walked away in Spike Lee's world, and only allowed when you're pondering how wrong you are and how right the director seems to think he is all the time.Damon Wayans is awful in whatever accent he was trying to do, Jada Pinkett is woefully miscast, Michael Rappaport is probably regretting how he played a rich white stereotype, and everybody else is probably glad that they did a better job than the higher paid leads. And Spike Lee can fill his hubris tank up all the way and pretend he's still relevant to a world that has forgotten Do the Right Thing and is now waiting for something else to happen so he can leech on that pity train as well.

First I wanted to see the remake with Nicolas Cage! But that version seems to be very bad! The high rating and the praise of fans really got me curious! So I decided to watch the original! To be honest I am at a loss of words! This movie has to be one of the most overrated movies ever made! If you can call this a movie! It was more of a musical than a conventional movie! As a true thriller\/horror this fails miserably! (In my opinion this is not a spoiler,but can be conceived as one,that is why I will play along and warn you!) SPOILER ALERT From the moment Edward Woodward comes to the island it is obvious that something will happen to him! You don't have to be a genius to discover that! He is called to the island in order to find a missing girl! During his investigation he soon finds out that strange things are going on like villagers running around naked, having sex on the beach,pagan rituals,villagers singing songs!

Lots of barbed exchanges here between the old curmudgeon and the independent new woman. Some comedy too as he slips her a psychedelic that cures headaches. As it develops, Connery, with Bracco's help, finds the source of a cure for lymphoma in the top terrace of the rainforest. Alas, before he can harvest enough of the stuff to explore the possibility of its being synthesized, some big industrial operation plows a road through the forest and destroys the trees in which the stuff grows. Bittersweet ending. Humankind is hoist by its own petard by what some ecologists call a progress trap. As compensation the old fox and the young feminist become friends. It's a bad trade.Between 1960 and 1990 one fifth of the world's rainforest was lost. In Brazil, where this film is supposedly set, the Amazon rainforest between 1991 (when the film was shot) and the year 2000 has lost between 415 and 587 square kilometers, an area about twice the size of Portugal. The tragedy is not that the forest is gone. Who cares about wood? It's the consequences, many of them falling into the category of unknown unknowns that counts.

After an absence of six years (since License to Kill), a new era in Bondism dawns; everything, out of necessity, is new a new Bond, a new M, a new Moneypenny and a whole new world, without the Soviet Iron Curtain which dominated the Bonders in the eighties. Well, Q is still here - the same old Q; he shows up in a wheelchair and we think, oh my - he's not doing well; but, it's all part of the sleight-of-hand during the gadget-facility scene. The teaser starts things off right, beginning with a spectacular bungee-cord jump and ending with a stunt that attempts to surpass the best teaser of all time - the one from The Spy Who Loved Me. The only way to beat that one was to show something unbelievable and this does, but so what? It's Bond. It's also interesting that the teaser takes place nine years earlier, which would place it around the time of the first Dalton Bonder. Tina Turner sings over the strange and even, at the time, controversial credits, which depict Bond girls smashing symbols of the Soviet regime - oh-oh, a subversive, subliminal message here? Probably without meaning to, the filmmakers gave the new Bonder some edge for the nineties.Six years doesn't really sound like a long time but it almost looks like we've entered a new century since the previous Bonder. There's a heavy emphasis on computer technology and both the white hats & the evildoers seem to rely on these new advances, most of which did not exist in the eighties. Some of the dialog reflects this passage of time, such as when M, a female successor to the post, voices her negative overview of what Bond represents - or, what he used to represent. There's also a decidedly different flavor to the relationship between Bond and MI6 HQ, including Bond's bond with Moneypenny - certainly not the warm relationship we'd seen between Connery & Maxwell, for example. Ironically, there's a coldness here even though the Cold War is over, maybe because they're not teamed against the Soviets any longer. We kind of expect M (the always effective Dench) to criticize Bond, but nice Moneypenny? However, the scene where they all watch an electronic map as the pulse goes off is excellent, suggesting close teamwork. Brosnan does well as the new Bond and it's fortunate he didn't get the part earlier as planned - he's just the right age here. He doesn't have Connery's power but he also doesn't indulge in as much awful smirking as Moore, creating a well-balanced interpretation. He's a bit more emotional than those two old-timers, letting loose with a great big smile more than once, but he's also very serious when he needs to be, sometimes switching to a grim outlook almost abruptly. The tension is there, unlike the Moore version, but he also has a nearly superhuman competency, which is what 007 needs.The mission begins in beautiful Monte Carlo (cards, anyone?), featuring the return of the Aston Martin, a spiffy auto race and the theft of a special helicopter. Bond then visits the new Russia in St.Petersburg, where there's a prolonged chase with a tank. He ends up somewhere in Cuba, searching for a huge satellite dish - this reminds of the fake lake from the humongous You Only Live Twice days.

There's also a decidedly different flavor to the relationship between Bond and MI6 HQ, including Bond's bond with Moneypenny - certainly not the warm relationship we'd seen between Connery & Maxwell, for example. Ironically, there's a coldness here even though the Cold War is over, maybe because they're not teamed against the Soviets any longer. We kind of expect M (the always effective Dench) to criticize Bond, but nice Moneypenny? However, the scene where they all watch an electronic map as the pulse goes off is excellent, suggesting close teamwork.

The tension is there, unlike the Moore version, but he also has a nearly superhuman competency, which is what 007 needs.The mission begins in beautiful Monte Carlo (cards, anyone?), featuring the return of the Aston Martin, a spiffy auto race and the theft of a special helicopter.

Jerry, who is not the most astute of individuals, hires a couple of real losers from the frozen northern reaches of Fargo, North Dakota for the job. Then things begin to slip from bad to worse as Jerry helplessly watches on.Before I say anything, I would like to say I've seen the edited television version, so I don't know if it is different from the theatrical version. When I watch this movie, it says it is based on a true story and after I finished watching it, I had a hard time believing it, but still, it was a fantastic film.This whole movie is like a kidnapping plot gone wrong. Although there are some dark subjects in the film, there were some pretty funny moments (that's why calling it a comedy thriller). Like any great movie, the script for this one is written really well and the characters aren't one dimensional.I like the dialog so much, that I just love it! I never really thought dialog could be written this well. The characters are fantastic! You, or I, can fall in love with every one of them, just because of those well written lines.This isn't your ordinary kidnapping film (or maybe it is. I haven't seen that many). This film looks so original and different in a kind of way. It's also very heartbreaking and I also liked how the movie ended. It felt complete and satisfying.William H. Macy's performance is really weird but was really good. It's probably because of the weird personality. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare performances were subtle, but not bad. And my favorite character of all is played wonderfully by Frances McDormand.This is one of the best movies ever made. The whole movie was shot really well and the dialog was fantastic. The characters were lovable and the whole movie was really satisfying. Watch it, people. I guarantee you will love it as much as I do.

Cleverly, this opening sequence is re-visited twenty or so minutes into the film when the son of one of a couple of main characters named Stevie Wayne (Barbeau) reveals he was one of the kids around the fire and it's then when we realise that this is, in actual fact, happening in our 'real' world.This is one of a few things that makes The Fog a smart and fun (if you can call a horror film 'fun') horror film which uses rather a few conventions in a clever and satisfactory manner. The film attempts to build up suspense as well as intrigue by making seemingly bland and obvious things actually rather eerie. These include someone sweeping the floor late at night in a closed convenience store whilst simultaneously having his curiosity aroused by odd happenings the other side of the shop &#150; we don't know what the hell is going on but the important thing is that we don't know who or what the hell is doing it. Could they be ghosts? Or was that just a spook story; since the kid hasn't stated he was part of that band of children just yet, we still don't know.Another occurrence of this is when the two characters of Hank (Haynie) and Elizabeth (Lee Curtis) are driving along in a truck late at night and suddenly have their windows smashed in following an unnatural movement of fog; again, we don't exactly know who or what has done this or even why this has happened. What I also noticed about The Fog and liked in an identifiable way was the fact the film is, for the bulk part; a detective story. Although this may sound like something to put off horror fans from watching it given the power of Carpenter's other horror effort from around this time; The Thing, which didn't cover half of the distance The Fog does and instead beds down into a situation of extreme horror and distrust; it actually plays out in a refreshing way of getting to the bottom of something truly uncanny that is happening in your home town.Given the fact that most of the film plays out like this, the film is then sliced in half again with Hank and Elizabeth doing things their way and a priest in a church taking care of things on his side of the patch. Once the priest makes a discovery and involves local political powers; you get the false, comforting feeling that everything may well be resolved in an understanding manner but this is very wrong. As each event leads onto the next, Stevie's son becomes the victim we are forced to fell bad about the most as he is the character that suffers the brute of The Fog and its ghosts the first time we actually see them properly. I feel it's from this scene on that the film moves up into the gear people from today's horror generation will relate to the most.It's from here on that The Fog becomes an often frightening fight for survival as the ghosts near their targets and ultimately; their goal. The score is fantastic as is the element of chase, the dark cinematography as the fog sweeps across land and just about anything else (including seeping through windows and door cracks) is marvellously done and a certain shot nearer the end when the ghosts are standing there, in close to perfect formation amongst some church pews; as still as stones, is imprinted on my mind as I write this.The Fog will not be a film for everyone. Do not expect a film similar to The Thing but do not expect to be completely disappointed. What few things I couldn't work out included the fact that if the old man at the beginning knew so much, why didn't he inform everyone else once the odd happenings started? Also, half way through the film when the detective element is at its hilt; I thought to myself wouldn't it be great if even I didn't know what was going on? thus, the fact the campfire story is told at the beginning in the first place pretty much spoils things for the audience.Do not let these things put you off too much, The Fog is still an enjoyable horror film that fans of more 'classical' horror films where the bad-guys are mythical creatures will enjoy.

Christianity is a soft target.And this movie does lampoon Christianity despite the clever - clever Oxbridge sophistry employed by Cleese and Co. to the contrary.I don't have a problem with that per se,my problem is that the makers lacked the courage to admit it.Surely a group as daring and innovative as the Pythons should have the balls to say yes,this is a movie that takes the pxss out of Christianity - and we don't care. I went to see The Life of Brian in the West End with a group of middle - aged schoolteachers and social workers all of whom were determined to demonstrate how unoffended they were by guffawing heartily at the drop of a hat.There was no one under 30 in the audience,perhaps an indication that the Pythons' appeal was to a demographic that found their humour familiar from years of being subjected to it from the original sources i.e. The Goon Show,Round the Horne,Marty Feldman and of course the great Spike Milligan who surely must have felt just a little rueful at accepting a small part in the movie that would never have existed had he not more or less single - handedly invented surreal radio thirty years earlier. Yes it is a funny movie,and I did laugh a lot,but daring and original it most certainly isn't.Carry on Cleo was funnier without the pretension and the faux daring. It is probably becoming clear that I am not a particular admirer of Pythonesque (the very word sends a shudder up my spine) humour. To me the whole group seem like smug,sniggering,cocky overgrown schoolboys who have been told how clever they are for so long that they have - for years -believed in their own publicity.Occasionally,one - like Michael Palin - will make a genuine effort to do something completely different(to coin a phrase) but even he cannot resist referring to his time with The Organisation on a regular basis. Terry Gilliam,perhaps the most talented of them all,broke free to make The Twelve Monkeys,one of the most dazzling of all 1990s movies,a creation of real daring and panache. If the boys really want to be brave and outrageous perhaps they should consider making The Life of Mohamed but I really don't think they will,do you? ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"28 July 2007","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Todd Haynes' film, Velvet Goldmine, is a masterful tribute\/love letter to the glam\/glitter rock movement of the 1970s. All the audience really knows of Velvet Goldmine's idols is what any fan would know. We experience the story through interviews and musical performances and that astoundingly provides us with enough information. It's the aesthetic of man's life is his image&#150;that superficial beauty expressed through art reveals so much more than at first glance. Haynes (Far From Heaven, I'm Not There) has a passion for music and its artists that shows his earlier short film, Superstar, about Karen Carpenter, acted by an-all Barbie and Ken cast, is referenced in Velvet Goldmine in one of my favorite scenes in which two young girls play with Brian Slade and Curt Wild Kens while T-Rex's Diamond Meadows spins on their record player. In Velvet Goldmine, a top-notch, well-chosen cast acts out the principle characters and stories here wonderfully.Glam rock superstar, Brian Slade (based on David Bowie), is played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers (The Tudors, Elvis, Match Point) to perfection with his thin, effeminate looks and swaggering. Haynes has great fun with the notion that there was a time in popular culture history that androgyny and bisexuality were seen as a cool fad. Velvet Goldmine's main story is Brian Slade's rise and fall from fame. Slade's cold and calculating ways accumulate in the hoax of his own assassination&#151;the ultimate symbol for the death of glam rock. His most sympathetic side is revealed during his affair and subsequent break-up with punk rocker Curt Wild.Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting, Star Wars Prequels, The Island) plays Curt Wild by feverishly emulating Iggy Pop--although the history of Wild having electroshock therapy to cure his homosexual leanings is straight from the life of rock icon Lou Reed. McGregor's performance of T.V. Eye and Gimme Danger are startling and unforgettable. Both Rhys Meyers and McGregor do their own singing for their characters. Upon seeing Wild's performance, Slade is obviously envious of him and attracted to him&#151;inspired, Slade takes his music to the next level. On his first trip to America, Slade doesn't forget about Wild and meets him. Slade and his entourage go to a club where Polly Smalls (Donna Matthews and Teenage Fanclub) performs in a very Suzi Quatro way. Wild sits in the corner, obviously strung out on heroin&#151;all the while Mandy Slade, Brian's wife, laughs. But Slade gets Wild a music contract&#151;and Slade becomes Wild's new main man. Later Mandy describes Slade's and Wild's relationship as being marketed as some sort of new Tracy and Hepburn. Mandy and Brian become more estranged.Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, In Her Shoes, Little Miss Sunshine) is perfectly cast as the love-her-or-hate-her Mandy. Pay close attention to her accent She is not doing it badly--here is an Aussie doing an accent of an American woman who would often speak in a faux English accent. Brilliant. Mandy goes from being an audacious woman to a cynical woman. Ten years later her broken marriage is the only interest anybody has in her as rock journalist Arthur Stuart interviews her in a bar.Another one of the three gorgeous male leads, Christian Bale (American Psycho, Batman Begins, Rescue Dawn), plays glam rock fan\/rock journalist Arthur Stuart. Although his part seems to exist as a frame tale, he's the most effective and relatable character in Velvet Goldmine. The subplot of Arthur is one of the most unique coming out stories about being a closeted homosexual along with being a closeted glam fan. In his bedroom, teen Arthur listens to his Maxwell Demon album while staring at the seductive gatefold picture of a semi-nude Slade. Does he want him? Or does he want to be him? Bale's acting here is a revelation&#151;he reveals so much through those eyes and facial expressions. He also has a major transition he goes from a wide-eyed, vulnerable, and fan-obsessed teenager to a downcast-eyed, jaded, and wiser adult. Much to his chagrin, the adult Arthur is given the assignment of finding out whatever happened to Brian Slade. He clearly wants to forget his past, but is it from embarrassment of youthful fanaticism, or is it something more? Leaving home because of his sexual orientation and love of glam rock, young Arthur does not have to live vicariously through his idols anymore and can start living his life as he must. After the Death of Glitter Rock concert, young Arthur meets Wild&#151;that leads to a one night stand on the roof top and Arthur's literally taking the place of his superstar idol, Brian Slade, in Wild's heart if just for one night. Adult Arthur overcomes some of his jadedness as he confronts and makes peace with his past. During Tommy Stone's press conference, he asks him about his connection to bisexual pop singer Brian Slade&#151;Tommy Stone being Slade's '80s more commercial reincarnation of himself. Earlier in school, young Arthur scribbles out a sketch of Brian Slade while his teacher reads from Oscar Wilde's Picture of Dorian Gray, which sums up Arthur's experience He felt that he had known them all&#133;.It seemed that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own. In Velvet Goldmine there is the theme of the permanence of art. Todd Haynes shows that this music&#151;and this movie--is much more than disposable pop culture, but akin to the works of Oscar Wilde and the movie Citizen Kane, both which he references throughout, and that art is kept alive by the appreciation of it by the fans. Oscar Wilde's emerald pin symbolizes this&#151;as it passes to one artist to another, then to a fan, Arthur. In return Arthur Stuart gives his Tommy Stone press pass to a young eager fan. An old favorite, 2HB, plays on the jukebox, and we see everyone enjoying the music. One person says, God, I love this song. Velvet Goldmine ends with the final message of the song fade away never.
