The studio didn't fancy that much, so Allen instead turned Sleeper into a tribute to cinema past; Chaplin, Keaton, Laurel & Hardy, the Marx Brothers. Woody is a recognisable film icon by this time, and his opening appearance takes full advantage. The film begins with conversations and movements of other characters, building our anticipation of Woody's entrance. A body is awaiting reanimation after being cryogenically frozen, and we are told that he was a clarinet player and the owner of a health food restaurant called 'The Happy Carrot'. Already we can piece together that this is Woody's entrance; he is in real life a clarinet player, and the choice of health food restaurant already puts us in mind of his neurotic film persona. The body is still covered over with tinfoil, which is slowly peeled back to reveal the famous glasses. Woody will now steal the show without saying a word, putting on a silly expression and wandering around semi-conscious causing chaos. The seriousness of an impromptu visit from security is played off against Woody staggering around, pushing food into people's faces and turning circles in a wheelchair in the middle of the tense conversation.The dystopian future setting allows plenty more opportunity for juxtaposing the deadly serious with the farcical. A doctor asks Woody to assist in identifying various artifacts they have recovered from the 20th century (he identifies Charles De Gaulle as a famous French chef and Bela Lugosi as the mayor of New York City) which ends with the placing of a pair of clockwork chattering teeth onto the desk. None of these scenes are better than the appearances of Rags, a robotic dog awarded to our hero when he is being rehabilitated into society. Its attempts to subdue a kidnap attempt from the underground is right up there with Chaplin's lunch machine from Modern Times in its ability to reduce me to tears of laughter every time.Much of Sleeper is a riot of timeless physical and visual comedy and silly one-liners, along with a few references to contemporary 1973 society which don't travel so well down the years. It's the small touches that make all the difference; the Jewish tailors, the gay robot butler, the giant chicken. Some pieces feel inserted, a sketch placing Woody as Miss Montana doesn't work quite so well, but a sketch where Allen plays Blanche Dubois to Keaton's Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski does. My favourite recurring gag is the government troops with the rocket launcher.I've heard it commented that in 1973 Woody Allen is still just a slapstick comedian, and that cinematography was not even a concern for him for another few years. A quick glance at Sleeper tells you that is clearly not true. Sets and costumes are stunning, from the little light-up bubble cars, to the way-out dress of Luna's friends, and most obviously of all in the silhouette scene. Allen and Keaton are silhouetted behind the middle of three screen panels, discussing what to do next. They break apart to each occupy the end panels and then reunite in the left. It's a moment of real art cinema.Towards the end the laughs move around to domestic squabbling between Allen and Keaton, who emerges as equally talented in the slapstick stakes. Her empty-headed histrionics give way to a sweet double-act as they find themselves in the operating theatre tasked with cloning the dead leader from his nose. She puts in a fair bit of physical comedy too, letting go of the wrong end of a bow in the forest and drowning herself in tape during yet another botched part of the mission. The pair had already separated by this stage, which conversely led into the golden era of their screen partnership. There's an easy camaraderie between them, like a pair glad to remember the fun parts of a relationship without the pressure of everyday lives and tensions.Sleeper is one of those special films that makes you feel like you belong to a club the more times that you watch it. On first viewing the volume of jokes is almost overwhelming, you're not sure whether you should be paying attention to the physical humour, the one-liners or the serious plot stuff (such as there is).

Well, yes, naturally... Love and Death is certainly not as obviously funny as Sleeper was. There are still many slapstick moments but they are less drawn out and the film as a whole seems to rattle by at great pace. The chances are you're going to watch it and, like me, think 'well, that was... unusual', then spend some time researching it to discover exactly what it was that you just watched. And then you'll watch it again. And then again. The more of the background references you start to fill in, the more Love and Death rewards you. Some is parody, some more like tribute. Scenes are recreated from Battleship Potemkin and Persona, music is lifted from Alexander Nevsky and the grim reaper makes an appearance after The Seventh Seal (but before Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey put the finishing touch on that joke). Pieces of classic Russian novels come into play directly (The Brothers Karamazov, War & Peace). The jokes run deeper still. Sergei Prokofiev is credited with music under S. Prokofiev to match Russian credit sequences. Woody and his father exchange dialogue which has been constructed entirely from Dostoyevsky titles. The level of immersion is incredible and complete... you could almost describe the film as a serious comedy. Allen even reprises himself; just as Diane Keaton sings the rebel song from 'Bananas' during 'Sleeper', we have throwbacks to the 'Bananas' dream sequence both in Woody being hoisted on a cross for a quick one-liner and in the dream of the coffins.Much of the comic interplay between Allen and Keaton carries through from 'Sleeper'; the scene of the pair posing at the door as Don Francisco and his sister recalls the operating theatre, but here they are taking on more weighty characters which allow the very genuine acting talents of both to emerge. Many of the set-pieces require precise timing, delivery and expression, and it is always delivered. Allen is a ball of nervous energy, but more focused than before. Keaton is freed from the idiot chains and plays the whole comic spectrum - her earnest deadpan delivery of parodies of the dense Russian prose are especially memorable. Supporting actors produce comedy gold too, whether it's James Tolkan's concerns about the British development of beef Wellington, Father Nikolai's sketches of Russian Jews, the soldier with the 'lock' of his wife's hair (Careful, don't drop it). In its rich tapestry of characters it almost becomes that which it parodies.Much of Love and Death was filmed in Budapest, other parts in Paris. Woody Allen is synonymous with New York, and this filming trip would be his last away from the Big Apple for more than 20 years. While in Budapest (which was occupied by the Red Army), he refused to drink the water and brought all of his own food and water, which enabled him to keep his feet when everyone else was stricken with dysentery. The weather continually worked against the shooting schedule, one of the actors had both legs broken in an accident, some negatives were destroyed and scenes had to be re-filmed. Many of the actors didn't speak English, which was necessary for much of the early humour; we have a whole family who are very eastern European in appearance and manner, and we have Woody as his anachronistic self.The danger in talking about this film for any length of time is that you will end up just listing off great scenes and jokes. Sleeper, as great as it is, was a slapstick comedy that occasionally had to be filled out to fill a feature-length slot. Here, we feel like everything has been condensed in order to squeeze down to a feature length, and that every joke, every sight gag, every parody is like the best selection from a larger selection; a greatest hits parade.

Title Not sure what it means, but it sounds pretty cool if that counts.Pre-Titles We get a really exciting pre-titles sequence that sees Bond engage in a vicious fight with a SPECTRE agent who was disguised as a woman before fleeing via jetpack. It's great that some action is provided straight from the off and the fight itself is fast and fierce with Barry's pounding score as a backdrop. The jetpack is a bit silly, but it's still memorable and allows for a unique getaway.Theme Song Welsh crooner Tom Jones puts in a decent vocal performance, but its John Barry's excellent work that makes the song great. The main hook stays in your head and the punchy instrumentation fits perfectly into the action setting.Plot SPECTRE number 2 Emilio Largo implements a plan to steal two nuclear warheads and use them to hold NATO to ransom. Bond is sent to the Bahamas to follow Largo's trail and find where the warheads are hidden before it's too late. The plot has all the makings for an intense story, though it is told well enough it never takes full advantage of what could have been a gripping story. It takes far too long to get going and nothing is left for the audience to work out, it shows us exactly what is happening and that takes some of the edge off proceedings. Most of the film feels like James Bond on holiday and that isn't a bad thing, but it makes everything seem slow and a bit uninteresting.James Bond Sean Connery carries on his more charming and witty turn that we saw in Goldfinger. I'd say that this is his Bond at his most relaxed as he remains cool and composed even when confronted by danger, but he isn't afraid to use brute force either. I think Connery again covers every aspect well, is fun to watch and it's the last Bond film where he looks like he truly cares.Bond Girls Claudine Auger as Domino is something of a mixed performance. She looks the part, but she struggles to show true emotions and she doesn't really do much. The character isn't fleshed out very well and it's difficult to truly care about her as a result. Martine Beswick is underused as Bond's ally Paula and is a bit of a pointless addition. Villains Adolfo Celi is a contender for the most boring Bond villain of all time as Largo, simply giving someone as eyepatch doesn't make them interesting. Celi does have a good look, but he again suffers from poor writing. I can't recall a single line of dialogue he has and in most of his scenes he just stands around looking annoyed. Luciana Paluzzi is excellent however as femme- fatale Fiona Volpe. She has an understated intensity, great lines and is the most believable threat to Bond here.Support The funnily named Rik Van Nutter steps in as Leiter and does an okay job. He looks pretty cool and has a calming presence, but at this point Leiter is simply Bond's lackey and just takes orders. Bernard Lee is excellent again in his few scenes as a more anxious M.Action The action ranges from decent to horrendously boring. There are far too many underwater scenes, all of which are slow and bring to the pace to a grinding halt. Bond fighting of henchmen and sharks is pretty cool at first, but it gets boring quickly. The climax is an absolute mess and it's like they didn't know how to end the film so they threw as much on screen as possible. It is impossible to tell who is who, the effects are ropey even for the time and the confrontation with Largo is a massive let down.Score John Barry provides another excellent score. Many familiar rhythms make a welcomed return and his new compositions are all really good too. He makes some of the underwater scenes more enjoyable and, like Connery, he is firmly settled into his role by this point.Production Values Firstly the film does look fantastic. The Bahamas was the perfect location for such an exotic adventure and it is captured in all its sparkling glory here, everything from the golden beaches to the clear waters look amazing. Terence Young keeps the low-key look that he went for in the first two films, but adds a bit more colour and style to proceedings. It's nice that he continued to develop and he does create some really effective shots throughout. The editing is a big issue however.

","genre":null},{"date":"6 July 2015","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Bond Review. Title Not sure what it means, but it sounds pretty cool if that counts.Pre-Titles We get a really exciting pre-titles sequence that sees Bond engage in a vicious fight with a SPECTRE agent who was disguised as a woman before fleeing via jetpack. It's great that some action is provided straight from the off and the fight itself is fast and fierce with Barry's pounding score as a backdrop. The jetpack is a bit silly, but it's still memorable and allows for a unique getaway.Theme Song Welsh crooner Tom Jones puts in a decent vocal performance, but its John Barry's excellent work that makes the song great. The main hook stays in your head and the punchy instrumentation fits perfectly into the action setting.Plot SPECTRE number 2 Emilio Largo implements a plan to steal two nuclear warheads and use them to hold NATO to ransom. Bond is sent to the Bahamas to follow Largo's trail and find where the warheads are hidden before it's too late. The plot has all the makings for an intense story, though it is told well enough it never takes full advantage of what could have been a gripping story. It takes far too long to get going and nothing is left for the audience to work out, it shows us exactly what is happening and that takes some of the edge off proceedings. Most of the film feels like James Bond on holiday and that isn't a bad thing, but it makes everything seem slow and a bit uninteresting.James Bond Sean Connery carries on his more charming and witty turn that we saw in Goldfinger. I'd say that this is his Bond at his most relaxed as he remains cool and composed even when confronted by danger, but he isn't afraid to use brute force either. I think Connery again covers every aspect well, is fun to watch and it's the last Bond film where he looks like he truly cares.Bond Girls Claudine Auger as Domino is something of a mixed performance. She looks the part, but she struggles to show true emotions and she doesn't really do much. The character isn't fleshed out very well and it's difficult to truly care about her as a result. Martine Beswick is underused as Bond's ally Paula and is a bit of a pointless addition. Villains Adolfo Celi is a contender for the most boring Bond villain of all time as Largo, simply giving someone as eyepatch doesn't make them interesting. Celi does have a good look, but he again suffers from poor writing. I can't recall a single line of dialogue he has and in most of his scenes he just stands around looking annoyed. Luciana Paluzzi is excellent however as femme- fatale Fiona Volpe. She has an understated intensity, great lines and is the most believable threat to Bond here.Support The funnily named Rik Van Nutter steps in as Leiter and does an okay job. He looks pretty cool and has a calming presence, but at this point Leiter is simply Bond's lackey and just takes orders. Bernard Lee is excellent again in his few scenes as a more anxious M.Action The action ranges from decent to horrendously boring. There are far too many underwater scenes, all of which are slow and bring to the pace to a grinding halt. Bond fighting of henchmen and sharks is pretty cool at first, but it gets boring quickly. The climax is an absolute mess and it's like they didn't know how to end the film so they threw as much on screen as possible. It is impossible to tell who is who, the effects are ropey even for the time and the confrontation with Largo is a massive let down.Score John Barry provides another excellent score. Many familiar rhythms make a welcomed return and his new compositions are all really good too. He makes some of the underwater scenes more enjoyable and, like Connery, he is firmly settled into his role by this point.Production Values Firstly the film does look fantastic. The Bahamas was the perfect location for such an exotic adventure and it is captured in all its sparkling glory here, everything from the golden beaches to the clear waters look amazing. Terence Young keeps the low-key look that he went for in the first two films, but adds a bit more colour and style to proceedings. It's nice that he continued to develop and he does create some really effective shots throughout. The editing is a big issue however.

My title refers to the great sociologist David Riesman who separated societies by the type of people it produced. Decadent cultures with declining birth rates, like ours, produce other directed people who seek consensus before making any decision. Wayne personifies the inner directed during the zenith of America before its decline; he carries all the norms and folkways of his culture within him. He is openly contemptuous of other's views. The stand alone Lone Wolf; that was the Icon that was John Wayne. Here he gives a great performance hunting down Ned Pepper and Tom Chaney for the whippersnapper Ross who proves to be almost as much of a challenge. My favorite scene in the movie is the interchange between Strother Martin and Darby; her business acumen, and wielding lawyer J. Noble Daggot as a weapon are hilarious. Watch his exasperation as she runs rings around him mentally taking him for quite a ride. Darby really steals the movie with her portrayal of Matty Ross. She is the perfect foil of Cogburn who resents her mothering but cannot but help admire her fire and independence. Wayne gives a great performance when many comic moments lightening the film. He has to hold up the bad acting Cambell who, though a good singer, was a terrible actor. Look for an early Robert Duvall as Ned Pepper and Dennis Hopper still as bad an actor even way back here. The photography is stunning, the dialog well written. Cogburn is idealized in his fighting abilities but not in his being a drunken reprobate with still a little light left in him. The ending is touching without being gooey her proffering him a burial plot after he saved her life. This was the greatness of the movie; see how when she gets her father's things, she holds them up next to her quietly and cries without a full symphony behind her. Back here, the writing evoked the emotions not maudlin music. The showdown between Rooster is silly but it was an iconic image. Look, give him a break; I love the people attacking this scene and yet giving Arnie a pass in Commando when he guns down a hundred guys. Yes, it is phony but it is pure realism compared to the modern action pictures of today. Wayne was what all men from my generation wanted to be. As mentioned, you could take him out in the middle of nowhere and he was as solidly moral as he was in a city. This was the inner directed man. He did not need to peruse a chat room to find out what the most popular beliefs were. Not a giant little boy, unemployed living off his girlfriend like we see today. This is was the time of men; men who protected and even died as Wayne did in The Cowboys. In the midst of the castration center that is current matriarchal America, what a joy to behold a real man; courage, strength and honor. A great movie it has great action, acting with lots of humor.

A Great Movie ","genre":"Adventure, Western, Drama"},{"date":"6 July 2015","score":"58 out of 87 people found the following review useful","review":" Spoilers AheadThe masterpiece, the legend that made people, like myself stand in line for two hours at ten at night for the midnight show. People coming out of the theater were telling us,You will not be sorry, it was fantastic, you will not believe it. The first shot of the star destroyer coming across the face of Tatooine provoked loud gasps of awe from the audience. My big brother looked over at me and said, I told you. In 1977, this was not a movie; this was a cultural event that enveloped the entire country. In our city, only the Westgate with its 1100 seat cinema had the honor of showing the movie. They had showings starting from 11 AM to Midnight. Whenever you drove by, there were lines out to the street. The movie, after a thunderous opening, takes the time to develop the main character Luke. The scene of him looking longingly at the two suns with William's music captured the quintessence of youth; the wish to go out there and accomplish something blended with anxiety that time was passing us by. What a scene!! It captured Luke's restlessness that spoke to all the young people in the audience. This is the greatness of the work; the development of Luke. Notice, unlike Guardians Of The Galaxy we do not simply jump into mindless action Lucas took the time to make us get to know and care about Luke. It gives it its depth.Even Solo is drawn with greater depth than modern movies. We get Greedo trying to shake him down, his open contempt for Obi Wan and his patronizing Kid addressed to Luke derisively. We cannot see Chewie's expression but even his grunts sound like they are laughing at Luke also. Lucas knew where he was going with Luke and he purposely draws him as a pathetic, ingenuous, bumbling dolt at the first. Contrast to his entrance in Jedi, look how far the characterization has come. This is the core of why this trilogy worked and the prequel did not. In the prequels, there simply is not characterization. The cast here will not win any acting awards, besides Guiness, but there is development of characters.

He doesn't need to, he's just sat through 6 million feet of film from the Apollo and Gemini missions. He has watched President Kennedy's speech about putting a man on the moon in which he makes clear that the technology for doing this has not even been invented yet. He has seen the tragic deaths of the crew of Apollo 1 in a roaring fireball in a test before they even got off the ground. He has seen footage of touchdowns and take-offs from the lunar surface. He has heard hours of detailed communications between astronauts and the ground crews. There is no need to waste screen time in addressing idiots. It reminds me of seeing a protest against Scientology in Edinburgh; to me, Scientology is so ridiculous that to protest against it gives it a weight that it doesn't deserve. Interestingly, Reinert also doesn't waste screen time on most of the things that 'In The Shadow Of The Moon' would take up; the cold war, the fighter pilot backgrounds of the Apollo crews. That film takes a more conventional all-around documentary approach, with close-up talking heads whose names and missions are restated on-screen each and every time they speak. With this film there is none of that, in fact it's often difficult to decipher who is speaking and which particular mission footage is from, or even if the voice and the footage are from the same flight.The different missions are instead merged together in a single sequence, beginning on the launch pad, all the way into orbit, lunar landings, reconnaissance on the surface, take-off and return. Each mission was essentially the same as any other from Apollo 11 onwards, with the exception of Apollo 13 which blew an oxygen leak and had to be abandoned. The drama of that situation is massively underplayed here, there are none of the great sweeping strings moments, we have only highly professional men doing highly specialised jobs... at least until we get out of earth's gravitational field.What follows from this point is the strength of 'For All Mankind'. Everyone has heard about the cold war, beating the Russians, the whole world watching on TV as Neil Armstrong comes down the ladder. Our sense of wonder was in looking at them, their sense of wonder was in looking at what they could see and experience directly. As soon as the gravity departs, these ultimate professionals become children again, spinning torches in zero gravity, bouncing around on the moon singing tum ti tum ti tum.., playing country music on tape recorders, listening out for college football scores. We even see astronauts messing around so much that they go sprawling on the ground, only to end up scolding each other for getting so dirty.Not telling us exactly what is going on, or who is speaking, or exactly what you are watching can be frustrating, but it allows us a view of events free from the context of politics, nostalgia, even personality at times. Dave Scott of Apollo 15 stands looking upon the Moon's hilly terrain and observes I realise there's a fundamental truth to our nature... Man must explore. Absinthe minds will enjoy the sense of wonder that comes from seeing people on the surface of another world, far increased over most film representations by being real footage with real people.Even so, there is a little directorial dishonesty, or artistic license depending on how you want to look at it. Scenes from Gemini are inserted to appear like those from Apollo. Kennedy's opening speech has a word dubbed, altered from for the progress of all people to for the progress of all mankind, in order to better suit the purposes of the film. Understandable, perhaps, but why fiddle it? Similarly a memorable audio clip describing how the Moon was perfectly lined up ahead of the space shuttle as it stood on the launch pad is accompanied by a clip showing this. The only problem is that this footage did not exist - it was created for the film by pasting a photo of the Moon over the command module, now in a museum. Again, understandable, and seeing the Moon through that window alongside the description is indeed memorable. but when you find out that it was created and inserted it's a bit of a let down, like finding out that the Ramones legendary live album 'It's Alive' was largely re-recorded in a studio afterwards.What isn't at all a let-down is the Brian Eno soundtrack, whose eerie ethereality keeps you in mind of the dimensions of space as compared to the delicate tin can of the lunar lander modules. The fragility of these vehicles is best summed up by the little windows, which look almost impossibly delicate given that one small breach would mean near-instant death for all on board.

This seems to be more of an obvious fear for the male in a heterosexual relationship than it is a woman's; the desire to make a presence that's simultaneously meaningful and respectful, but not too brazen, is a tricky dance to accomplish and the anxiety that accompanies such an event is usually too much to even begin to adequately articulate. One winds up overthinking everything to the point of either saying something they didn't mean to say or feeling like they have just made a complete fool of themselves in front of the person they love and her own family.I suppose I can rest easy knowing that writers Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg have made a worst case scenario film about the subject, which effectively makes almost any evening spent with the parents of your significant other seem desirable and successful in comparison. Jay Roach's Meet the Parents is the kind of film that takes those fears and persistent worries and etches them into a film that ups the stakes so high that, after a while, it becomes difficult to laugh given how far the film has fallen from its own sense of realism. it takes a realistic and common fear and repeatedly throws so many incredulous situations towards it, turning it into a farce, that, by the end, it's not only hard to take the film seriously, but the characters as well.We meet Gregory Focker (Ben Stiller), a male nurse who has been in a relationship with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) and is working to execute the perfect marriage proposal as soon as he gets off work. Just before he's about to pop the big question, Pam gets a call from her sister that she is now engaged, right after her fiancée asked Pam's father for her hand in marriage. While Pam claims it isn't necessary to do such a thing, it's a sweet, traditionalist gesture. As a result, Greg keeps his plans under the wraps and agrees to go to Pam's family's home in Long Island for the wedding.Upon losing his luggage on the flight, Greg meets Pam's father Jack (Robert De Niro) and her mother Dina (Blythe Danner). Right off the bat, Jack is cold and offputting to Greg, emphasizing Greg's less-than-positive view of cats and his own career choice of being a nurse. This sets the tone for what will be the next few days - awkward, uncomfortable interactions that will revolve around Greg trying to please Jack, but, in the end, only resulting in frustration or anger on Jack's behalf. Things only get intensified when Greg winds up meeting Kevin (Owen Wilson), Pam's ex-fiancée who is helping organize her sister's wedding.Meet the Parents has a committed cast of greats, starting with De Niro and Stiller, the two obvious, and even making strong uses of Polo and Danner, who transcend supporting roles and have a few of their own moments to shine.

This seems to be more of an obvious fear for the male in a heterosexual relationship than it is a woman's; the desire to make a presence that's simultaneously meaningful and respectful, but not too brazen, is a tricky dance to accomplish and the anxiety that accompanies such an event is usually too much to even begin to adequately articulate. One winds up overthinking everything to the point of either saying something they didn't mean to say or feeling like they have just made a complete fool of themselves in front of the person they love and her own family.I suppose I can rest easy knowing that writers Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg have made a worst case scenario film about the subject, which effectively makes almost any evening spent with the parents of your significant other seem desirable and successful in comparison. Jay Roach's Meet the Parents is the kind of film that takes those fears and persistent worries and etches them into a film that ups the stakes so high that, after a while, it becomes difficult to laugh given how far the film has fallen from its own sense of realism. it takes a realistic and common fear and repeatedly throws so many incredulous situations towards it, turning it into a farce, that, by the end, it's not only hard to take the film seriously, but the characters as well.We meet Gregory Focker (Ben Stiller), a male nurse who has been in a relationship with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) and is working to execute the perfect marriage proposal as soon as he gets off work. Just before he's about to pop the big question, Pam gets a call from her sister that she is now engaged, right after her fiancée asked Pam's father for her hand in marriage. While Pam claims it isn't necessary to do such a thing, it's a sweet, traditionalist gesture. As a result, Greg keeps his plans under the wraps and agrees to go to Pam's family's home in Long Island for the wedding.Upon losing his luggage on the flight, Greg meets Pam's father Jack (Robert De Niro) and her mother Dina (Blythe Danner). Right off the bat, Jack is cold and offputting to Greg, emphasizing Greg's less-than-positive view of cats and his own career choice of being a nurse. This sets the tone for what will be the next few days - awkward, uncomfortable interactions that will revolve around Greg trying to please Jack, but, in the end, only resulting in frustration or anger on Jack's behalf. Things only get intensified when Greg winds up meeting Kevin (Owen Wilson), Pam's ex-fiancée who is helping organize her sister's wedding.Meet the Parents has a committed cast of greats, starting with De Niro and Stiller, the two obvious, and even making strong uses of Polo and Danner, who transcend supporting roles and have a few of their own moments to shine. Consider Polo's character consistently trying to tow the lines of loyalty to her father and express her love for Greg, while Danner's character's cheeriness is usually diminished by the sternness of her husband.

Even the non-great films (The Edge, Spawn) were still cool to see.Out of everything that came out that year, The Ice Storm is the most overlooked. I had only heard of it after seeing Gene Siskel's annual Top 10 lists. He ranked this the best movie of 1997. Although I disagree that it is the best, it is certainly in my top 10.The Ice Storm stars Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Henry Czerny, Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood, Katie Holmes and David Krumholtz. Aside from Titanic, this has the best cast of 1997. The movie is about two neighbouring families the Hoods (Kline, Allen, Maguire, Ricci) and the Carvers (Weaver, Sheridan, Wood, Byrd). Each member have their own subplots that are ruining their lives, and eventually intertwine. Kline is sleeping with Weaver and struggling with drinking; Allen suspects infidelity; Wood wants to get serious with Ricci but she wants to do some exploration; Maguire gets high with his prep friends and wants Holmes. The coldest storm ever is about to hit and effect everyone. This is a coming of age story for everyone in it. I could really relate to every subplot. Everybody is selfish and not caring about the other, that is pretty much what the movie is about. When the storm hits, some images stay with you as they symbolize different things in the story. Sometimes, ice is a nice thing to see and we also see it in its darkness. Each time the ice changes its mood, it foreshadows the mood coming up. The ice could also be used to represent how the main characters are cold. None of the characters are really nice or likable. But they are still very compelling and interesting. How Ang Lee could do that is beyond me. They live in the woods in suburban New York. That could show how isolated they are with reality and the rest of the world. It all builds up to a shocking and heartfelt conclusion that stays with you for a long time. The denouement is a real tearjerker. Afterwards, you are left thinking about the movie as a whole and what it all says. Everything that the movie says is phenomenal.Still Ang Lee's best movie.

Afterwards, you are left thinking about the movie as a whole and what it all says. Everything that the movie says is phenomenal.Still Ang Lee's best movie. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"6 July 2015","score":"","review":" I honestly think 1997 was the best year for movies. Look at all the calibre hits that came out that year. Even the non-great films (The Edge, Spawn) were still cool to see.Out of everything that came out that year, The Ice Storm is the most overlooked. I had only heard of it after seeing Gene Siskel's annual Top 10 lists. He ranked this the best movie of 1997. Although I disagree that it is the best, it is certainly in my top 10.The Ice Storm stars Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Henry Czerny, Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood, Katie Holmes and David Krumholtz. Aside from Titanic, this has the best cast of 1997. The movie is about two neighbouring families the Hoods (Kline, Allen, Maguire, Ricci) and the Carvers (Weaver, Sheridan, Wood, Byrd). Each member have their own subplots that are ruining their lives, and eventually intertwine. Kline is sleeping with Weaver and struggling with drinking; Allen suspects infidelity; Wood wants to get serious with Ricci but she wants to do some exploration; Maguire gets high with his prep friends and wants Holmes. The coldest storm ever is about to hit and effect everyone. This is a coming of age story for everyone in it. I could really relate to every subplot. Everybody is selfish and not caring about the other, that is pretty much what the movie is about. When the storm hits, some images stay with you as they symbolize different things in the story. Sometimes, ice is a nice thing to see and we also see it in its darkness. Each time the ice changes its mood, it foreshadows the mood coming up. The ice could also be used to represent how the main characters are cold. None of the characters are really nice or likable. But they are still very compelling and interesting. How Ang Lee could do that is beyond me. They live in the woods in suburban New York. That could show how isolated they are with reality and the rest of the world. It all builds up to a shocking and heartfelt conclusion that stays with you for a long time. The denouement is a real tearjerker. Afterwards, you are left thinking about the movie as a whole and what it all says. Everything that the movie says is phenomenal.Still Ang Lee's best movie. ","genre":"Drama"}]
