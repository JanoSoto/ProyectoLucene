This is so obvious a device that the only time the movie made me laugh was when Mr Crystal was forced to play the de Niro role at a mob meeting. The various stereotypical Italian-American gangsters are stereotypically amusing enough but I can't help feeling a 1999 movie showing African - Americans to be predominantly pimps and robbers wouldn't have gone down too well. Is the Italian-American anti-defamation league still in business I wonder? No matter;the boys went on to make Analyse Thatas one might have expected which no doubt buffed up the bank balances. Mr de Niro went on to make Meet the Parents and it's appalling sequel which offered further proof - if it were needed - that he is not a natural comedian.If only someone would have the courage to tell him.

For the ones who don't, let me fill you in quickly.A scientist tries to create a hybrid of plants and animals in his laboratory. The idea is to make it possible for plants to survive everywhere. Like have tomatoes grow on the arctic. The goal is obviously to end world hunger. Very noble. However, his dream is crushed when enemies invade his lab, kill his assistant and steal the notes for the formula. However, the scientist tries to escape with the newly made formula, only to accidentally spill it on himself. As he dives into the nearby swamp, he becomes what we now know as Swamp Thing.The movie explains and shows the background of Swamp Thing very accurately. So at least they got that part of the comics right. It's not 100% accurate, but I'm not here to discuss details.I liked the movie. It was partially because I grew up with DC comics. For people who want a good, entertaining movie about a misunderstood monster, they should definitely check this one out.The acting, effects and story build-up are all fine enough. Sure, it's not Shakespeare, but it doesn't have to be.A must-see for fans of DC comics, and an enjoyable ride for fans of this genre movies.7 out of 10 stars for Swamp Thing!

Please. Cult classic usually means low quality crap liked by only the people it was directly made for and this mess is no different. The acting for the most part is ham handed and self conscious, the directing is kind of juvenile and the script is incoherent. This is obviously trying very hard to be a Kevin Smith rip off, using the same dialog style and supposed sly references only Trekkie geeks would get, sadly it's not even close to Smith's worst. It is also a blatant take on Swingers with the lovable loser theme and even uses one of the same actors. At points you think it may be getting better and there are even a few giggles here and there but untimely it fails. There is a scene in the diner near the middle that may be one of the worst written I have ever viewed. Also the amazingly real to life situation where poor average looking Star Trek geeks get laid every other day by a new model is just boring. The last scene with Shatner rapping is just ridiculous, in fact the whole self deprecating act he puts on through this snore fest is embarrassing and just like this movie, does not work.
