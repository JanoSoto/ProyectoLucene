[{"date":"8 December 2004","score":"5 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" I remember, back in 1999 (or it could have been the start of 2000), when I first saw The Matrix. It was big, bold, loud, exciting...it had guns, bullet time, Rage Against the Machine, plenty of action, a hot woman in a lead role....I remember thinking I should like this. But I didn't. Like Kill Bill, it's hard to believe that a fan of extreme blood and gore like myself could possibly dislike a film that sees one lady pluck out another lady's eye, drop it on the floor and stand on it, but it's true. OK, it's a little easier to believe when you consider that every scene in Kill Bill, apart from that one and the Lucy Lui fight was rubbish, but I'm sure you can see what I'm getting at. Fast forward 4 or 5 years to today, and the rewatch. I have a theory that states that any film that I enjoy cannot possibly be bad, because I watch movies for enjoyment (nobody watches movies to be bored) and if a movie fulfils that need for enjoyment, then it has done it's job and therefore it can't be bad. And I enjoyed The Matrix. However, I maintain that it's not a great film. Now, if Pulp fiction has taught us anything; it's that it isn't what you take, it's what you do with it....but by god, the Wachowski Brothers should definitely consider changing their name to the Wachowski BanditsFor a start; the film is Star Wars reincarnated. Keanu Reeves is the one that brings balance to the force, and he even has everyone doubting him for a while(!), Princess Morpheus gets kidnapped and tortured and our hero's must go and save her...him, the bad guys have taken over the galaxy...I mean the world, and there's only a bunch of rebels to save it, they go and see Yoda...I mean the Oracle, who predicts the future and stuff, there's training sequences a la The Empire Strikes Back, Neo must become one with the force, whoops, i mean 'believe', Agent Smith is Neo's father...oh, OK I made that last one up, but you see what I'm getting at.And it's not only Star Wars that the Wachowski Bandits have ripped off, The Terminator and it's sequel aren't safe either. Of course, they couldn't have made Agent Smith actually be liquid metal, as they'd have a lawsuit on their hands, but he is just another version of liquid metal really...isn't he? Shown by the way he can transform from anyone. And what about the whole 'computers take over the world' thing, you didn't think I wouldn't spot that did you? And The Wachowski Bandits obviously aren't fascists, because even shitty movies aren't safe. What about the whole SN thing? The way that the hackers are made to look cool....Hackers anyone? But like I said, it isn't what you take; it's what you do with it. Just like Tarantino did, Bonnie and Clyde...I mean Andy and Larry have stolen all these elements, and mixed them up into one coherent, and trend setting piece of cinema. Also like Tarantino, The Doberman Gang haven't just stolen, they've made some stuff themselves as well. Bullet time, for a start. Of course, it's not much of an expansion on the slow motion in films like The Killer; but still. Also, the idea of the 'matrix' itself is an original one. (unless it's been ripped off a film I haven't seen\/heard of)The soundtrack fits too, which is rare when it's mostly rave\/heavy rock music. I think there's only Natural Born Killers and Lost Highway that I can think of when it has worked. Anyway, when Rage's Wake Up came on before the credit sequence, it fit very well. Also, the scene during the training with the woman in red and the agent worked well with it's music. In fact, that might even be my favourite scene in the movie. It's cool and it works. In fact, the film does ooze a sense of cool throughout, mostly because of the leather jackets. It's not a complete piece of cinema, however. I don't know if it's built upon in the sequels, but there isn't a lot of emotion in the movie. Sometimes, it doesn't matter, some of the best films of all time are very cold on that front; my top 2, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and The Evil Dead both are; but then again, they didn't try and be soul searching or have a great depth like The Matrix does. For an example of what I'm talking about; the love between Trinity and Neo. I noticed her saying she is watching him at the start, but other than, the love seemed to be based on the fact that the Oracle said it would happen....so I'm supposed to care? In fact, none of the characters seemed to have any depth, or anything about them at all. What drives them? Why does Morpheus blindly believe that Neo is 'The One'? Why did Neo take the red pill? Is it his character? I don't know.Also of note is the way that people seem to refer to The Matrix as a confusing film. It uses a non-linear style of storytelling (it runs straight, but you don't find everything out all at once), and that's the only confusing thing about it. When you think about it, it's very simple.There isn't a great deal of depth, and the film doesn't pose any real thought-provoking questions either. Of course, there's the central theme; it's all an illusion, but what does that mean? Of course, it's not all an illusion really...so what's the message? Don't build too many machines? There is a central question, though, which is would you take the blue or the red pill...and that's not a bad question; but the film, through it's non-linear storytelling and imaginative premise, isn't as deep as it appears to be. Bit like Fight Club really. Of course, the premise in The Matrix does get you thinking in a what if... frame of mind, but so do lots of things, like on British TV show, Kenyan Confronts; when he exposes credit card scams etc...what if mine was stolen, so does that make Kenyan Confronts a deep and complex masterpiece? (By the way, did anyone think that Lawrence Fishbourne looked stupid during his 'believe' type moments?) Still, like I said; the film is entertaining. The action sequences are stunning and the film looks lovely throughout, so it gets itself high marks for that. It's well paced as well, and unlike a lot of action films; the non-action scenes in The Matrix aren't boring. But that's all; it's like Song 2 (wuhoo!) or the Belly's gonna get you advert; fun, but not overly brilliant. However, I'm 'down' with fun films, so I'm down with this.

I thought about it might be better to see the other films of the series first... I don't know why, but I haven't been able to get a hold of any other View Askewniverse(to the uninitiated, those that feature the characters of Jay and Silent Bob) films, so the only two I've seen are this and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. So, I can't really say if this is good compared to the previous films in the series. I've seen the film a few times now... don't know how many exactly, since I've just put it on play a few times while doing other stuff and not paying too much attention to it. So, I've lost track of how many times I've seen it... but I doubt that it's been (attentively) more than three times, this one included. That doesn't sound like much, no? Definitely not too much... so why did I fall asleep during the last fifteen minutes? To make matters worse, I didn't even pay that much attention to it *this* time, either... so what happened? Well, personally I think the problem is the uneventful script... whenever a situation seems to start, a new character is introduced instead of anything actually happening. The viewer has barely picked up who everyone is by the time the film is over... and you know what the problem is? By then, you've stopped caring. Like another reviewer said, there's just too many characters, and as a result, none of them are properly developed or interesting enough to keep you watching. Yes, there is conflict, but it's only introduced once Smith's done pushing every joke or gag that he could possibly come up with for that scene. Now don't get me wrong, I think he has a good sense of humor... maybe even great. Just about any guy can laugh at Jay and Silent Bob. I don't mean to enrage or annoy any fans of Smith here, but I just think he could have done a better job on this. Come on, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was an instantly re-watchable laugh-a-minute film that had no slow moments... why did this one not seem to move at all? The plot is pretty good, but the pacing seemed off. The acting is all good. The characters are well-written but underdeveloped. The humor is very good, at times great. I didn't laugh as much during this movie as I did during Strike Back, but I did laugh... well, the first time I saw it, anyway. The basic idea is pretty good, as well. I might have found it more funny if I wasn't an atheist... but you can't please everybody. A few quick notes on the various actors; both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were good as angels. Linda Fiorentino does an OK job of carrying the movie. Alan Rickman is good as the highest ranking angel. Chris Rock is funny... not just in the movie, he's funny *period*. Salma Hayek is beautiful as always and gives a pretty good performance, though her character here is pretty much the same type of character that she always does. Jason Lee is cool... both in his character and just about every other movie he's done. Of course, Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith are awesome in their respective roles of Jay and Silent Bob... but that goes without saying for anyone who's seen them in any of the movies. All in all, probably the least entertaining of the Jay and Silent Bob movies, but not bad. Hey, it's Kevin Smith; he's usually funny... right? I recommend this to fans of Kevin Smith and of the other films in the View Askewniverse, and everyone else who is into this kind of humor.

I've seen the film a few times now... don't know how many exactly, since I've just put it on play a few times while doing other stuff and not paying too much attention to it. So, I've lost track of how many times I've seen it... but I doubt that it's been (attentively) more than three times, this one included. That doesn't sound like much, no? Definitely not too much... so why did I fall asleep during the last fifteen minutes? To make matters worse, I didn't even pay that much attention to it *this* time, either... so what happened? Well, personally I think the problem is the uneventful script... whenever a situation seems to start, a new character is introduced instead of anything actually happening. The viewer has barely picked up who everyone is by the time the film is over... and you know what the problem is? By then, you've stopped caring. Like another reviewer said, there's just too many characters, and as a result, none of them are properly developed or interesting enough to keep you watching. Yes, there is conflict, but it's only introduced once Smith's done pushing every joke or gag that he could possibly come up with for that scene. Now don't get me wrong, I think he has a good sense of humor... maybe even great. Just about any guy can laugh at Jay and Silent Bob. I don't mean to enrage or annoy any fans of Smith here, but I just think he could have done a better job on this. Come on, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was an instantly re-watchable laugh-a-minute film that had no slow moments... why did this one not seem to move at all? The plot is pretty good, but the pacing seemed off. The acting is all good. The characters are well-written but underdeveloped. The humor is very good, at times great. I didn't laugh as much during this movie as I did during Strike Back, but I did laugh... well, the first time I saw it, anyway. The basic idea is pretty good, as well. I might have found it more funny if I wasn't an atheist... but you can't please everybody. A few quick notes on the various actors; both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were good as angels. Linda Fiorentino does an OK job of carrying the movie. Alan Rickman is good as the highest ranking angel. Chris Rock is funny... not just in the movie, he's funny *period*. Salma Hayek is beautiful as always and gives a pretty good performance, though her character here is pretty much the same type of character that she always does. Jason Lee is cool... both in his character and just about every other movie he's done. Of course, Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith are awesome in their respective roles of Jay and Silent Bob... but that goes without saying for anyone who's seen them in any of the movies. All in all, probably the least entertaining of the Jay and Silent Bob movies, but not bad. Hey, it's Kevin Smith; he's usually funny... right? I recommend this to fans of Kevin Smith and of the other films in the View Askewniverse, and everyone else who is into this kind of humor. Just be prepared that you might find it boring. 7\/10 ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"8 December 2004","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I've taken my time before commenting on what is usually considered the great American film masterpiece, but at this point I feel up to it--having now watched the film eight times and read four books about it as well as watching the documentary The Battle over Citizen Kane twice. No, it doesn't take that much effort to understand the film, but research can embolden a person.The first comment so many people now make is that Citizen Kane is not a work of genius, but they're wrong; it is a work of genius--four genii in tandem. Herman Mankiewicz was a self-destructive, crazy, egotistical Hollywood genius long before Orson Welles would define that phrase (though he was not, as some have contended in recent times, a Hollywood intellectual--he was a master of lowbrow screwball comedy in the 1930s--see Pauline Kael's book Raising Kane); Orson Welles really was a genius, for all the things he wasn't; Greg Toland is perhaps the most famous and celebrated cinematographer in history to this day; and Bernard Herrman wrote seemingly every memorable film score from 1940 through 1970 (including what I consider the greatest film score of all time, Psycho).Citizen Kane also did not receive bad reviews upon its release; it received unbelievable raves. I read over 20 contemporary reviews of the film and over half of them called it the greatest film of all time, and the least adulatory called it a good film but not quite a great film. How we've had it come down to us from history that Kane received bad reviews upon release, I don't know; but it is patently untrue. It received fewer reviews than many films because of the Hearst boycott, but those it did receive were all adulatory.Now that I've dispelled some annoying myths about the film, I'll speak of the film itself. Perhaps its most notable quality is its beautiful and strange look created by Greg Toland and Orson Welles (how much each did is a matter of some conjecture). It is loaded with brilliant high-contrast lighting; large, mostly vacant, stage-like sets; and odd camera angles that give it a distinctive look that would then be appropriated by the film noir genre.However, what truly holds the film together is one of the greatest characters and performances in film history. Not truly William Randolph Hearst but rather an amalgam of big media types, including Hearst; Charles Foster Kane is an amazing character and Orson Welles's performance is nothing short of extraordinary--from the somewhat awkward dancing in the song scene to the unsure look on his face when Jed Leland asks for the Declaration of Principles to the way his physical mannerisms change as he ages, Welles crafts a wonderful performance. But if you're looking to define Kane by one moment in the film, it's not Rosebud, it's the speech Jed Leland gives about him, saying correctly, that's his story.The other performances in the film are also top-notch, highlighted by Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander, Joseph Cotten (whose performance may even equal Welles's, though his part is much less showy) as Jed Leland, and the beautiful Ruth Warrick as Emily Monroe Norton.Of all of this film's innovations, its use of music may be the most important. Music as a scene transition device was a radio trick, but since Citizen Kane, it's become standard in film as well. Bernard Herrman provided a score that is mostly brilliant, if at times a bit over-dramatic.Citizen Kane is fascinating and, above all, fun. It's loaded with great small pieces of humor (Kane Elected--Fraud at Polls, for example) and has all of the intellectual and academic fulfillment one could want in a film.

I think the main problem stems from the fact that due to the film aiming for the kiddie market, the PG-13 rating robs the film of a much creepier & darker, more violent & bloodier impact it could have had. One thing sorely missing from THE GATE is atmosphere, although the film opens up with a weird, stylish & very scary nightmare sequence, for the most part THE GATE is hamstrung from going to far in it's execution, which may turn off a lot of die hard horror fanatics.

Followed by GATE II RETURN TO THE NIGHTMARE (a.k.a. GATE II THE TRESPASSERS)***1\/2 stars ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"8 December 2004","score":"25 out of 34 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1991, three years have passed since a huge spaceship crash landed on Earth, dumping over a thousand humanoid beings into our already rapidly expanding population. These Newcomers, which is what we have come to know them as, were genetically-engineered for the specific purpose of slave labor. Soon afterwards, they are put into quarantine. The newcomers have almost all the physical features of human beings except for a few. They have no hair on their heads, the males can become pregnant and they have two hearts instead of one. When released, they are then integrated into our society. They are given names of famous places or important historical figures like San(m) Francisco or Ronald Reagan. This integration into our society however, opens the door for a new kind of racism. Racial slurs like slags are uttered behind their backs. Perhaps for the first time minorities are going to be looked upon from a different perspective. Human beings begin to fear for their jobs as the newcomers start to take over people's employment opportunities. It isn't long before they are being featured advertisements too. Much as Chinatowns have formed in major cities around the world, the newcomers are given their own Slag Town. Even as the newcomers start to become a big part of our society, this also opens the door for extraterrestrial crime. This in turn, introduces us to human cop, Detective Matthew Sykes(James Caan). Sykes, who has a slight distrust towards newcomers, becomes even more hateful of them one night after getting into a shoot-out with two newcomers, which leaves his partner dead and him thirsty for revenge. Matthew then sees his chance for revenge the next day, when he is assigned to be partnered up with Detective Sam Francisco(Mandy Patinkin, who is only recognizable by his voice and a few facial features). Francisco has recently been promoted and in turn has set a milestone for newcomers and the history books as becoming the first humanoid detective. Sykes who refuses to introduce Francisco as Francisco, gives him the nickname George. Sykes is naturally hateful towards Francisco, but as time goes on he soon begins to accept him for who\/what he is. As their investigation goes on, it leads them to the center of an extraterrestrial drug ring, headed by a shady newcomer named William Harcourt(Terence Stamp). The drug, known to the newcomers as Jabluka but better off known to us as liquid detergent, is a very potent narcotic. As George says it's more potent than any human drug. He is right about that.The drug, when taken in large quantities, can trigger a change in the newcomers, a change that is best kept secret. This is why George becomes so eager to see the drug destroyed before its presence is known to the human population. Alien Nation is such a unique piece of science-fiction that had the potential to be something really spectacular. It really bugs me that this movie had the chance to be something so amazing, so new, that it instead became a standard buddy flick with some sci-fi stuff thrown in it. James Caan and Mandy Patinkin make a good team and Terence Stamp is good to as the evil Harcourt. I believe that even though this movie is basically failed potential, I have gotten the bizarre social message hidden within it. It contains a message about how amazingly fast the newcomers have become a major part of our society. It amazes me that William Harcourt, although he is the bad guy in this movie, he is also extremely well educated. It's pure genius that he is able to use his high social status amongst the humans as a means of becoming a well known drug dealer. Human drug dealers probably would not need to envy or want to kill Harcourt, since they could find equal business opportunities in both their own communities as well as the newcomer community. The story also tells about the competition of aliens over humans. For millions of years, humans have been the dominant species on Earth. Now with the arrival of the newcomers, humans for the first time ever, are facing competition with a species that becomes more and more advanced every day. This explains largely in part as to why we are becoming more afraid of them, for fear of not only our jobs, but our place as the dominant species of our own planet.

With this in mind, it is possible that not far down the road, that the newcomers could enslave us, as they were back on their own planet.

Being African-American myself, the story reminds me largely of the civil rights movement of the 1950's and 1960's. African-Americans, as well as any other minority group, have faced about as much discrimination as one could take. The racism that has been associated with the newcomers is almost exactly like what happened when minorities began taking up jobs that whites had been vying for. Do you see what I mean?

These Newcomers, which is what we have come to know them as, were genetically-engineered for the specific purpose of slave labor. Soon afterwards, they are put into quarantine. The newcomers have almost all the physical features of human beings except for a few. They have no hair on their heads, the males can become pregnant and they have two hearts instead of one. When released, they are then integrated into our society. They are given names of famous places or important historical figures like San(m) Francisco or Ronald Reagan. This integration into our society however, opens the door for a new kind of racism. Racial slurs like slags are uttered behind their backs. Perhaps for the first time minorities are going to be looked upon from a different perspective. Human beings begin to fear for their jobs as the newcomers start to take over people's employment opportunities. It isn't long before they are being featured advertisements too. Much as Chinatowns have formed in major cities around the world, the newcomers are given their own Slag Town. Even as the newcomers start to become a big part of our society, this also opens the door for extraterrestrial crime. This in turn, introduces us to human cop, Detective Matthew Sykes(James Caan). Sykes, who has a slight distrust towards newcomers, becomes even more hateful of them one night after getting into a shoot-out with two newcomers, which leaves his partner dead and him thirsty for revenge. Matthew then sees his chance for revenge the next day, when he is assigned to be partnered up with Detective Sam Francisco(Mandy Patinkin, who is only recognizable by his voice and a few facial features). Francisco has recently been promoted and in turn has set a milestone for newcomers and the history books as becoming the first humanoid detective. Sykes who refuses to introduce Francisco as Francisco, gives him the nickname George. Sykes is naturally hateful towards Francisco, but as time goes on he soon begins to accept him for who\/what he is. As their investigation goes on, it leads them to the center of an extraterrestrial drug ring, headed by a shady newcomer named William Harcourt(Terence Stamp). The drug, known to the newcomers as Jabluka but better off known to us as liquid detergent, is a very potent narcotic. As George says it's more potent than any human drug. He is right about that.The drug, when taken in large quantities, can trigger a change in the newcomers, a change that is best kept secret. This is why George becomes so eager to see the drug destroyed before its presence is known to the human population. Alien Nation is such a unique piece of science-fiction that had the potential to be something really spectacular. It really bugs me that this movie had the chance to be something so amazing, so new, that it instead became a standard buddy flick with some sci-fi stuff thrown in it. James Caan and Mandy Patinkin make a good team and Terence Stamp is good to as the evil Harcourt. I believe that even though this movie is basically failed potential, I have gotten the bizarre social message hidden within it. It contains a message about how amazingly fast the newcomers have become a major part of our society. It amazes me that William Harcourt, although he is the bad guy in this movie, he is also extremely well educated. It's pure genius that he is able to use his high social status amongst the humans as a means of becoming a well known drug dealer. Human drug dealers probably would not need to envy or want to kill Harcourt, since they could find equal business opportunities in both their own communities as well as the newcomer community.

I was awe struck and instantly started to collect the weekly 'Return Of The Jedi' comic book. Round about 1984 in the comic it said that there were plans to make the 3 prequels but it was all hush hush. I remember thinking how awesome it would be. Well, as we all know the Star Wars prequels were along time away from being made in 1984 so when 13 years later i heard there were plans to actually make them with the latest effects i was over-joyed. Hmmm, i think you know where i'm going with this. I waited for two more years and when i finally got to see the first of the long awaited prequels. That's the day i lost my faith in George Lucas and CGI.I was extremely disappointed. I mean it is called 'Star Wars' and it has Jedi's and light sabre's in it. It also has the Emperor in it but it totally did not feel like a Star Wars movie. I really don't know where to begin.The Structure was poor for a start. The first couple of minutes at the beginning was fine then it just lost it. Talk about rushed scenes. One minute Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are sitting in a room on a Trade Federation starship and the next they're on Naboo with Jar Jar and then 30 seconds later they're in an underwater city. I was like what's just happened?!. The plot is weak as heck too. Darth Maul was under-used and had very little depth to his character. There was far too much CGI used which made me feel like i was watching an animated movie. The film is just so very shallow. I didn't even care when Anakin blew up the Trade Federation ship at the end. Also, there is Jar Jar Binks who is by far the most annoying character ever! He is so much the definition of something that was supposed to be funny but ended up so not being. What was Lucas thinking!!!? About 95% of people who have watched 'The Phantom Menace' hated that floppy eared t**t! This is probably the reason why Jar Jar is hardly in 'Attack Of The Clones'.I basically think that the actors did a decent job, all the blame is Lucas's fault. I really was disheartened. I watched it again the other day just to see if i was really being too harsh on it and y'know, i disliked it even more. As a movie on its own it's average but because it was the first ever Star Wars episode and that i had waited about 15 years to watch it it was quite poor. The pod race was pretty cool though. 'Attack Of The Clones' is better but not by much. I just pray to god that 'Revenge Of The Sith' gets it right.

Kind of like how The Basketball Diaries glamorizes drugs at first, but shows the bad side by the end of the movie, which is far worse than the good side is good. David Duchovny plays Brian Kessler, an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend, who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for, I don't know where, places where nudity passes for art. Maybe it really does and I just don't understand it. At any rate, Brian and Carrie (Duchovny and Michelle Forbes, who fits the role flawlessly), make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites. Brian, the writer, will write the book, Carrie can take the pictures.Being artistic types, Brian and Carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip, so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses, and are contacted by Early Grace and Adele Corners (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis). Early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer, sees the ad on a bulletin board, and decides to leave the state for a while, violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord's murder so he won't have to deal with a pesky murder investigation. Two birds with one stone, you know.The movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes, the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash, without resorting to clichés or even ending up with caricatures of either type. Brian and Carrie are artsy liberals, but while Carrie catches on to Early and Adele, Brian is fascinated with Early's status as an outlaw, as seen in the scene where Brian shoots Early's gun. Never having fired a gun before, he's as fascinated as a little kid. While Adele and Carrie are back at a hotel and Adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that Early broke her of smoking and that she's not allowed to drink (Early doesn't think women should), Early and Brian are out at the local bar. Brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him, and Early first gives advice to Brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy. Hit him, Bri, it's comin'. This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie, partly because it's so funny what Early gleefully says as the guy's friends drag him away, bloodied and battered, but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel, we learn so much all at once about the two couples, their differences, and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them. And besides that, because Brian benefited from Early's actions and Carrie is appalled by what she hears from Adele, it also illustrates the different way that Carrie and Brian react to Early and Adele.Clearly, by now, you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller, where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues. On one hand it seems a little too convenient that Brian and Carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer, but on the other hand it's a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a cross-country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes. While studying the actions of past murderers, Brian and Carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying, and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it's in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past.I am constantly amazed at Brad Pitt's versatility as an actor. Consider, for example, his roles in movies like Kalifornia, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, and Ocean's 11 and 12. Pitt is like Tom Hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character, and is completely believable. Incidentally, I tried in vain to be Early Grace for Halloween this year, but just couldn't get the hair and beard right. I even got the hat right, which initially I thought would be the hardest part.It's easy to understand why a lot of people disliked Kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder, but I think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience's understanding of its subject matter. A film that didn't glorify violence, at least initially, could never be as effective as Kalifornia, but the movie structures it perfectly. The glorification is all embodied in Brian's and Carrie's fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened, but their realization, and ours, is embodied in the real thing, which they encounter with Early and Adele. The movie's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real.

Incidentally, I tried in vain to be Early Grace for Halloween this year, but just couldn't get the hair and beard right. I even got the hat right, which initially I thought would be the hardest part.It's easy to understand why a lot of people disliked Kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder, but I think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience's understanding of its subject matter. A film that didn't glorify violence, at least initially, could never be as effective as Kalifornia, but the movie structures it perfectly. The glorification is all embodied in Brian's and Carrie's fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened, but their realization, and ours, is embodied in the real thing, which they encounter with Early and Adele. The movie's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real.

His troubles begin when his girlfriend dumps him and heads for Hollywood to become a star. His first mistake is deciding to follow her. In his circumstances, the only way he can get to Hollywood is by hitch-hiking. He is picked up by a gambler who offers to take him all the way to California, and in appreciation he agrees to share the driving. Things are looking good (see rule #6), so we know this is where it starts to get interesting. And stupid. The gambler dies of natural causes (fortunately, he wasn't driving) and instead of calling the police, Al decides to rob him, bury him, and take his car, on the grounds that the police would never believe him if he told the truth. See rule #2 above.Although frightened that someone will find out his secret, and turn him into the police, Al nevertheless decides to pass the kindness of the driver who stopped for him onto someone else. So, he stops and picks up a hitch-hiker, a woman no less. See rule #1 and rule #4. This movie has one great moment that redeems all the craziness of its dysfunctional universe, and that is when Al - and the audience - realize that his passenger *knows* .. knows what happened to the gambler who gave him a ride. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it. I'll just say it's one of the best plot twists ever .. From this point forward, Al is under this woman's control. He dances to her tune, and she has all sorts of plans for him, most of which would not pass close legal scrutiny. See rules #3 and #4. There is another priceless moment in this movie that'll you'll miss if you blink. Al and Vera, the woman hitch-hiker, are in LA, and have rented an apartment. They make a liquor run for their supper, and after finishing the bottle, Vera announces I'm going to bed and puts her hand on Al's shoulder in an unmistakable care-to-join-me? gesture. Al's a wuss, but even he has enough spine to pass this invitation. See rules #1 and #3, though Al's response here belies rule #4. So, is Detour a good movie, or not? Yes, it's a good movie, but it is not a great one. What makes the movie special are the elements that cannot be described, only appreciated while watching the movie. For a non-existent budget and a six-day shooting schedule, Detour is a masterpiece. I can't imagine a better movie being made under similar trying circumstances. From All Movie Guide Directer Ulmer .. succeeds in creating a memorable, dark, nightmare world, uncaring, cynical and brutal. I thought every part of the theatrical elements of this story were masterfully done. I love the amoral, fatalistic, decadent ambiance of film noir, and this movie certainly has that. But, the whole movie turns on a plot point that will not hold Al thinks that no one would believe him if he told the truth about the man who gave him a ride. In a film noir universe, that may be true; in the real world, it is not, so I cannot buy into the movie experience at the most pivotal point of the story. For that reason, I can only rate Detour a 6 out of 10. Still, it is a remarkable movie given the circumstances under which it was produced.

In his circumstances, the only way he can get to Hollywood is by hitch-hiking. He is picked up by a gambler who offers to take him all the way to California, and in appreciation he agrees to share the driving. Things are looking good (see rule #6), so we know this is where it starts to get interesting. And stupid. The gambler dies of natural causes (fortunately, he wasn't driving) and instead of calling the police, Al decides to rob him, bury him, and take his car, on the grounds that the police would never believe him if he told the truth. See rule #2 above.Although frightened that someone will find out his secret, and turn him into the police, Al nevertheless decides to pass the kindness of the driver who stopped for him onto someone else. So, he stops and picks up a hitch-hiker, a woman no less. See rule #1 and rule #4. This movie has one great moment that redeems all the craziness of its dysfunctional universe, and that is when Al - and the audience - realize that his passenger *knows* .. knows what happened to the gambler who gave him a ride. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it. I'll just say it's one of the best plot twists ever .. From this point forward, Al is under this woman's control. He dances to her tune, and she has all sorts of plans for him, most of which would not pass close legal scrutiny. See rules #3 and #4. There is another priceless moment in this movie that'll you'll miss if you blink. Al and Vera, the woman hitch-hiker, are in LA, and have rented an apartment. They make a liquor run for their supper, and after finishing the bottle, Vera announces I'm going to bed and puts her hand on Al's shoulder in an unmistakable care-to-join-me? gesture. Al's a wuss, but even he has enough spine to pass this invitation. See rules #1 and #3, though Al's response here belies rule #4. So, is Detour a good movie, or not? Yes, it's a good movie, but it is not a great one. What makes the movie special are the elements that cannot be described, only appreciated while watching the movie. For a non-existent budget and a six-day shooting schedule, Detour is a masterpiece. I can't imagine a better movie being made under similar trying circumstances. From All Movie Guide Directer Ulmer .. succeeds in creating a memorable, dark, nightmare world, uncaring, cynical and brutal. I thought every part of the theatrical elements of this story were masterfully done. I love the amoral, fatalistic, decadent ambiance of film noir, and this movie certainly has that. But, the whole movie turns on a plot point that will not hold Al thinks that no one would believe him if he told the truth about the man who gave him a ride. In a film noir universe, that may be true; in the real world, it is not, so I cannot buy into the movie experience at the most pivotal point of the story.

It seems happy and with a lot of joy in the way it is presented, but the things that are presented are sad and disturbing. Malèna (Monica Bellucci) is a young woman, the most beautiful one in a small Sicilian town, 1940. Her husband is send to war and the rumors start. People say she has a lover, probably only because they are jealous. A young boy named Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro), the film's narrator, who is deeply in love with the woman does not believe this and creates his own perfect image of her. Then the news of her husband's death arrives. She becomes a poor woman and to save herself she does some more things people disagree with, including sleeping with a German soldier (although not on screen). Renato keeps idealizing the woman.Where both stories will lead, Malèna's and Renato's, is not for me to reveal but I have to say one thing. Monica Bellucci, who only speaks about five times in 'Malèna', has a thing with violent films. 'The Matrix'-movies existed out of just sci-fi violence, but in 'Irréversible' she is in one of the two most violent single scenes I have ever seen and of course she is Mary in 'The Passion of the Christ'. In this film she is in another violent scene, one that feels completely out of place. Although events were sad, presented differently, this scene does not belong in this movie, not on screen at least.The director is Giuseppe Tornatore, something I could guess before learning it from end credits. It looks and feels the same way as his great 'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso'. The difference is that 'Cinema Paradiso' knew it was really about, the story really was filled with joy. Here the film only seems that way, there is no real happy moment. When Renato's father slaps his son it is presented in a funny way and yes, it might make you smile, but that does not make it a happy event.

However, in The Mosquito Coast, Weir does not capture the beauty he does in other films, most notably Dead Poet's Society and Master and Commander The Far Side of the World. This isn't to say the direction is bad by any means, but it's weaker than typical Weir (which is sort of like saying it was one of Kenneth Branagh's weaker performances or Mozart's lesser operas).However, this film has something many of Weir's do not A truly fascinating story. Well, maybe more of a truly fascinating character; but the character drives a wonderfully interesting story, exploring the dangers of fanaticism under any circumstances and throws in a religious conflict, Communism, and a journey to Hell as possible interpretations. Allie Fox is one of the most interesting characters I have ever seen on film; in a category with Charles Foster Kane (Citizen Kane), Edward Bloom (Big Fish), and the pair of Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker (Heavenly Creatures). He's a brilliant and charismatic inventor who takes his family to Mosquitia to build his perfect society and never gives up on that dream to return to America, no matter what the cost.Harrison Ford, as with most actors who have worked with him, did his best work with Peter Weir, on Witness, but he seems somewhat miscast here. While Ford is in general a capable (no better than that, but no worse either) actor, he is not the most charismatic of actors, which Allie Fox needs. Someone like Tom Cruise, Kenneth Branagh, or Mel Gibson has the kind of charisma to pull off this role well, but Harrison Ford just doesn't quite have it. His performance isn't bad; he just doesn't have the charisma that would make him fit the role perfectly, but that does detract from the film.The other actors aren't given much to go on for their performances, but River Phoenix is the standout, giving his character a depth beyond what is written for him. The only particularly bad casting is Martha Plimpton, whose Emily Spellgood comes off as an unattractive future prostitute and who seems to have one expression and that's it some sort of odd come hither look.All in all, The Mosquito Coast is a good film and one of the most intellectually stimulating I have ever seen; but it's not a must see. Just don't judge Peter Weir as a director based on this film--if you want to see what he's capable of doing as a director, watch Dead Poets Society or The Truman Show.

Ron Hubbard's epic sci-fi novel. Here's my view. For me, the book was terrific, which millions of others who bought it internationally can vouch for I'm sure. But the film is mediocre at best. There is one basic, major flaw with the movie, which I believe, doomed it from the beginning, and that was trying to tell this story in 2 hours. It never should have been attempted. Maybe three hours would have worked, but Travolta and director, Christiansen, didn't have that luxury.The book is rich in characters, sub-plots, humor, and most importantly a true sense of the world. Battlefield Earth is basically a story about the subjugation of mankind by an evil force and how one man helps the rest of the ragtag survivors of the planet fight back. What I loved the most about the book (besides the obsessed character of Terl) was the Scots and surviving tribes of other nations teaming together to fight back against impossible odds. I remember when I saw the film, I kept saying where is Robert the Fox? Where are the Scots? Where is the sound of bagpipes coming over the hill? Where is that sense of Braveheart that I felt when I read the novel. None of that wonderful sense of the world made it into the film.And that's why it failed.It's my opinion that Travolta had a worthwhile dream to realize the book in film, and unfortunately, out of practical necessity, cut far too much of the richness of the story, and thus, unintentionally, ruined it. The flaws should have been seen at the shooting script stage, but they weren't -- and then everyone was on board the Titantic (though I don't think the film is that much of a disaster really. I would give it a 5-10 -- worth watching if you're expectations are not super-high.)Too bad it can't all be done again as an animated series which could do justice to the depth of the book.

I simply think that that talent should have been given more screen time. That does not mean I think that it should have been turned into a Hollywood-ised positive falsehood, simply that more time should have been given to what the movie was promoted as. As for the ending, I have no problem with unconventional endings - I usually enjoy them a great deal more than typical ones. I always enjoy endings that are not what I expected. What disappointed me so greatly about this one is that it didn't appear to go anywhere..I saw no joy or change in Laura's life, no deeper appreciation of herself (which I would have enjoyed far more than a 'success' story in the first place), nothing. I'm all for not tying up all the loose ends - it keeps up the suspense, but introducing and ending that does not address, in my opinion, and of the issues of self-awareness and personal independence put forward in the film is lacking in something.Perhaps if\/when I return to see the movie again (as I said my first viewing was tainted) I may see what everyone else is seeing. For now, it remains a disappointment. And,though I do this seldom, I feel the need to respond to one specific commentSurely it isn't implied that a 'good' movie dealing with someone dancing around the edges of the entertainment business only happens when the protagonist 'makes it' in the industry? presumably with attendant drug usage, alcohol abuse, sexual libertinage et cetera? even better of course if we are permitted the Schadenfreude arising from his subsequent collapse into whichever variety of nastiness is currently most titillating. Heaven forbid that such a person may realize that there are more important and rewarding pursuits in life!No. A good entertainment movie deals with the trials tribulations and hard work involved in getting into and staying in the entertainment industry. Whether they make it or not. I said more screen time, not success. This the movie handled well - but failed to note the balance between the pain and the enjoyment that comes with working in the arts. In reference to your comment about drug use etc...that is a stereotype that most artists do not fit and go to lengths to avoid. Yes, the industry can destroy you, and for many it has. But making it a 'presumption' that anyone involved in the arts is a druggie and an alcoholic is an insult to those of us who work in the field and take our profession seriously.The entertainment industry is and important and fulling pursuit and it is a tough one, and this movie does do a fine job of showing the tough aspect of it. I simply think that certain aspects of it could have been handled better or emphasised more.

Foremost, I think this film works on a comedic level mainly because Matthau and Williams play off each other so well. Williams plays his comedy in that typically frenzied style of his, injecting a good dose of physical humor to boot(pardon the pun). Matthau plays more of a straight man, but with his own style of deadpan humor figured in. Vigard's daughter character has her moments as well, her facial expressions(especially during the staircase scene) are very funny.This film also works as a commentary on the early Eighties scene, touching upon a number of issues faced by American society. This is the real reason why I believe this film is such a great movie, it gives a funny glimpse at what was happening in America on many different fronts. It covers topics such as losing your job, job hunting, and that interesting social-economic phenomena, unemployment compensation. It sheds light upon big corporate America's lack of allegiance towards its employees, a concept that was just beginning to take hold of the employment scene at the time. I'm sure that just about everyone(in middle class America at least) can relate to what Matthau's character experiences in the job montage sequence in the film. It also shows examples of the ever changing face of American society, such as the Spanish immigrant trying to collect unemployment and the Indian clerk Matthau encounters upon his application for unemployment, touching an issue that has gained tremendous momentum at the present day. It also covers the concept of Americans becoming so disenfranchised with their own society that they are driven to para-military lifestyles, which William's character explores through several really funny moments--you shot my gun!!. It also examines America's never ending fascination with guns.The film also covers ground on relationships,(as all good films do) mainly between the two main characters and the ways they try to help each other through their personal woes. Matthau helps Williams on a more direct level, but Williams helps Matthau's character in the sense that his antics help to distract Matthau from his own unemployment dilemma. Also covered, to a lesser degree, is the relationship between Williams and his fiancée, which underlines the balance between devotion and sensibility. The scene between Reed's character and his wife is both funny and insightful as well.Finally, the film's comedy itself is a very good blend of slapstick that will make you howl(the staircase scene!!) as well as the verbal aspects of well written comedy(police station,phone booth to name a few). Matthau and Williams are constantly playing off each other quite humorously. This film has several catchy lines, I find myself and my brother recalling them from time to time for a really good laugh--Tell young Kojack what he done and ...you've got the technique down. So, these are the reasons why I believe this film deserves a good look, it provides a rather serious look at American done in a very funny way. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 December 2004","score":"13 out of 20 people found the following review useful","review":" What a great film!!!

I read with a lot of interest everyone's comments on Don't Look Now and there is something missing from your summaries or criticisms of this movie - I'm talking about the scene when John sees his wife surrounded by the two ladies on a boat (while she should be in England...) None of you mentioned that what John is really seeing is in fact is own (upcoming) death. Indeed, John also has psychic powers but he refuses to admit them, even though he realizes weird things are happening to him (such as the foreboding of his daughter's death, when he drops water on the photograph of the cathedral with the small hooded figure). This is also why he always appears very embarrassed when he is around the two old ladies - he knows the blind one senses his psychic powers, although he is in complete denial of them. John sees his own death, but he's too down-to-earth to really understands what it means - and therefore, to run away from it. And thus he meets his tragic fate, while he had the means to escape from it.Personally, I am not a big fan of this movie, but I have to admit that it is really well done and the shots of Venice in wintertime are simply splendid. There are some scary moments, a little bit in the mood of the Shining by Kubrick. It is a fright that doesn't make you scream and jump into your boyfriend's arms (or girlfriend's, for that matter...), but it is a fright that comes from the inside, that makes you feel uneasy and disturbed. When the small hooded figure finally removes her hood and reveals her face... Oh dear, I was petrified on my chair! The old ugly wrinkled dwarf's face is just stuck in my memory forever (and yes, I admit, I even had nightmares about it...) The movie is not agreeable in itself, but I would nevertheless recommend it - although we've all let out so many spoilers already that probably no one will be very surprised or scared seeing it!PS  I apologize for the English mistakes I -surely- made, English is only my second language!
