For me movies like Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, JFK, Titanic and Star Wars did that.  By viewing a movie you see life in a different light.  Aliens also did that to me.  I didn't think a movie could scare me as much as Halloween did but this one certainly did that and more.  The atmosphere in this movie, and the lighting and cinematography and of course the direction are top notch, and some of the scenes are some of the scariest I've seen in my life time.  But what puts this movie over the top as one of the all time greatest films ever made is the casting.Sigourney Weaver is terrific but it is her supporting cast that shines and makes you feel like you know the crew that is heading to that desolate planet.Paul Reiser is perfect as Burke,the slimy corporate kiss ass that cares about profit before human lives.  Lance Henriksen shines as Bishop, the cyborg with a heart.  Jeanette Goldstein is the rough around the edges female marine that more than holds her own with all the testosterone floating around and Michael Biehn ( another Cameron favourite )is the perfect quiet leader that leads by example and not so much a loud demonstrative voice.  But the show stopper in this flick ( just as he always is in any movie that he is in ) is Bill Paxton.Paxton and Cameron have worked on Terminator 1, True Lies, Titanic and Aliens and Bill is one of those actors that steals scenes from every actor and was always a recognizable face even before Titanic.  Here, his Hudson character is the comic relief but he is also perhaps one of the true characters that we can all identify with.  His tough exterior is nothing more than camouflage for his frightened fragile interior.  He realizes the dire situation that they are all in and he can't hide his fear.  When he finds out that they won't be rescued for at least seventeen days, his response is  Hey man, we're not going to survive 17 hours man!  Those things are going to come in here and they're going to get us and.....  ( Ripley ) This little girl survived longer than that with no weapons and no military training.  ( Hudson )  Why don't ya put her in charge!!! Paxton is a gift to any and every movie that he is in and this is his finest work.  He should have won a best supporting actor that year.  And if you haven't seen this movie, rush to see it if only for Bill Paxton.  He steals the show.  But if a tightly wound, brilliantly technical and unbelievably scary movie is your thing, then you can't go wrong here.  This is easily a ten out of ten, and one of the best ever made.

However, this just means that these people have absolutely no connection with their inner child. These are the same people who hate Jar-Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode I in his entirety (but that's a different story). Never-neverland was a wonderful, fresh new fantasy land, and even though its inhabitants may not be what one expects, I believe the changes were for the good and showed that people can still have an ounce of creativity within them. The relationship between Rufio and Peter (Robin Williams) was at first angering and then heart-wrenching. My favorite part is when the Lost Boys finally realize that Peter really is THE Peter Pan (despite his lawyerhood) and when John Williams' music takes your heart and makes it truly soar to great heights. This is also one of John Williams' better scores. Also, Charlie Korsmo's (playing Jack Banning) acting was superb for someone who was still quite young. I don't know what movie the critics saw.

Would a film of this quality, power, and message be made today?  Probably not.  Sutherland, Moore, and Hutton play a normal American family--notably absent are sarcastic exhanges and detached teenage children of 90's family dramas.  These three actors create tension that most of us are all too familiar with in our families, but could never put into words.  That look from your mother that makes you want to die, the hints of guilt a father may feel about his parenting choices, and a teenagers inexplicable feeling of hopelessness.  All of these are portrayed effectively, yet normally for lack of a better term. There is nothing Hollywood about this movie, and that is what makes it so good. It is about a normal family, everyone's family.  When you watch, you cannot help but cringe from the unspoken tension, awkwardness, and sorrow that these characters feel.  We all have been in one of these three roles and can fully empathize with the characters.Timothy Hutton's performance is absolutely remarkable.  It never goes over the top, but never underplays it.  He truly gets in touch of what it is like to be a teenager ridden with guilt and depression.  Nobody really understands him, and this is painfully obvious.  Hutton must have been physically exausted throughout filming.  He performs some of the most emotional scenes ever put on film, and does it like the veteran that he was not.Donald Sutherland plays the father trying to make it all better.  He does not know how to reach out to his family after the tragedy.  Sutherland saves his character from being pathetic and portrays a man of intense love who does not know what he should do.  This character is a testament to all the men out there (the majority I might add) who do NOT cheat on their wives and think only about money.  Unlike many movies, Sutherland's character is a loving and nurturing father who will do anything to help his son.  it is a wonder how Sutherland did not receive an oscar nomination here.Mary Tyler Moore stuns with this dramatic turn of character.  She plays the mother to such precision that you actually forget she is playing a character.  Moore's mother could have easily been played as an easily hated character; instead, she portrays a complex woman who simply does not know how to deal with imperfection.  It is not her fault for how she reacts to Conrad, for she does not know HOW to react.  With the social circle she and her husband are in, there is little help or instruction on how to deal with tragedy.  So, she deals with it the best way she knows how to put on a smile and move on.

There were way too many loopholes in the whole time-travel idea, that was simply dismissed in the movie as sit back and enjoy yourself.  While that's a convenient way to cover up that story element, it doesn't make everything easily dismissable in the long run. My biggest problem with the film was its using almost every single joke from the first film repeatedly.  What was hilarious in the first film, gave me a feeling of I've seen this before this time around.  However, the film did have its shining moments.  The original comedy bits were more often than not hysterical, with heavy parodies of Star Wars and even The Island of Dr. Moreau.  Mini-Me was definitely the most entertaining of the new characters, stealing more than a fair share of the scenes.  His little dance halfway through the film pushed the bizarre comedy element into overdrive. Heather Graham as Felicity Shagwell was simply drop-dead sexy in the film, as she spent more time trying to rev Austin Power's mojo than subdue it. It should also be noted that Rob Lowe's impersonation of Robert Wagner's Number Two character was so incredibly dead on, it was almost eerie.

The journey brings them into many trials of existence, which we modern beings very seldom come in contact with.  At points, there scenes that capture a sense of humor that is so basic to our modern way of thinking, but for these characters they are just discovering such things like the concept of laugher.  At other points of the film, these brave men encounter situations that show the true brutal world of the survival of the fittest.  The manner in which these characters search for fire gives the viewer a true love for the characters courage and heroic nature.  For if they do not succeed, it is surely the end of their tribe and for them.  The fire holds the key to survival with its warmth, cooking function, and most of all its ability to ward off stalking predators.  Fire is power for beings at this point in time.  Just as knowledge is for modern human beings.This film succeeds in it's proportions,direction, settings, music, great special effects,and acting.  The acting especially is something to take notice of, since there is no recognizable language spoken.  The preparation for such a role as this these is amazing in its own right.

I have always been enthralled by movies that take place in prehistoric times, but I never expected this movie to be filmed with such consistency.  This film captures an innocent adventure, in which three men (Naoh, Amoukar,& Gaw) are selected by the tribe to recapture their snuffed out fire.

Generally well received by the reviewers, maybe it hits the NY Times bestseller list for a brief stint.  Then, after about three or four months everybody forgets about it, and buys the next contemporary serial killer novel with embossed letters and a brownish color scheme.That's the case here, minus the whole angle about it having been a novel. Well, it was a novelization, but that's not quite the same thing.For the most part Switchback is your standard, bargain basement detective story.  You get two parallel stories in the beginning, one of which has to do with cops chasing after a serial killer who's terrorizing the countryside.  The other story doesn't have anything to do with the price of tea in China, so it must be assumed that one of the guys in THAT story is the killer--so you spend your time guessing which one (I had the wrong one for about twenty minutes, I'm not ashamed to say).  When he's revealed you say, oh, okay.  Then you hang around while the rest of the machine works its way to the end.  Being a mystery, you don't know where it's going ALL of the time, but when it gets there, you sort of knew it all along.Unfortunately, it's rather confusing along the way, with plot twists and little leaps of faith and confusing bits that go by too fast for you to catch.  With all these things you think gee, this is what 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'The Spy Who Came In From the Cold' did to me, I must be watching something great.  Wrong.  This time you can say with impunity that your confusion is derived from a lackluster directing job, not any sort of infernal cleverness.  Plus it's rather emotionless, which doesn't help either.That said, an average joe movie like this has rarely been acted out so well. R.Lee Ermey is always a pleasure to watch; its a general rule that when the titles say also with R.Lee Ermey as... the movie isn't going to be all bad.  Danny Glover is also a plus--it's possible to say that the movie would've been a complete failure without his casting.  Randy Quaid is here too, in the role of the sourpuss FBI Agent on the trail of the killer. He's got (surprise!) personal reasons for catching him.  Additionally, Jared Leto is quite good as the Extraneous Plot Device, without whom the movie would be half its original length.  Of course, that might not have been so bad.

I knew what was coming - I'd read about it in the few reviews of Cube that appeared - and didn't particularly want to be snacking on spaghetti pomodoro when it happened.There were a few more moments like that in the course of the film, where I was so tense I had to peek from behind my fingers. I was surprised it was only rated 15 in Britain, as it scared me more than plenty of 18-rated horror films.In between the moments of tension we're introduced (in some cases briefly) to a group of people who seem to be on the corporate team-building weekend from hell. The characters are not rounded - that would either require a long introductory segment in the world outside of the cube, or long periods of dialogue which would slow down the film. Whilst this has the effect of making a character's death cause you to wince rather than feel sorrow at their demise, if you try and bear in mind that this is more of an idea movie than a character study you can let it pass. The acting is competent, although due to the lack of major characterization the actors tend to be reacting rather than acting. Quentin, the police officer, is occasionally hammy, but his descent into savagery from his initial role as the galvanizing leader of the group is interesting to watch. As for the others, you wonder what the rest of the group would have done if the essential members - the maths student, the autistic savant and the architect - had bought the farm early on in the film; you also wonder what the diced guy at the start did for a living, and how he could have added to the skills of the group if he hadn't had that unfortunately cheese-wire accident.At the end you do wonder if you're going to get to see on the other side of the final hatch - but then sometimes too much explanation spoils things. I prefer the original version of Close Encounters when you *don't* see inside the spaceship, and believe me I was much happier pre-Highlander 2, before I knew Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery were aliens from the planet Zeist.Cube CAN be viewed just as a horror sci-fi movie, although if you feel like looking for an allegory between the cube as our society and reaching the outside as salvation\/heaven, then you'll certainly find a lot here to back you up.

Before viewing the movie I had an advantage of reading people's positive and negative reviews which, on par, were evenly balanced from those who loved the move to those who despised TPM. I walked into the theatre feeling neutral due to the even feedback presented by the public.I came out of the cinema feeling satisfied about TPM. For the critics who slammed TPM I think they over react. One must remember that this is the FIRST movie out of six and therefore has to set a foundation which focused on Anakin. So there did not have to be an emphasis on Darth Maul or the Jedi characters and I felt we were sufficiently educated on Anakin's background.TPM was high on special effects I agree, possibly too high, but it's a sci-fi movie meaning that its ALL artificial anyway. So what's the difference can I ask those harsh critics between an artificial sci-fi movie world low in SFX and another movie with high SFX such as TPM? The panoramic views of the cities and landscapes were fantastic but I felt the SFX fell down with the characters on two grounds, one I felt they were copied and pasted as one does using a graphics programme causing over duplication of the same character thus losing individuality of creatures. The other ground where SFX fell down was the motion of the created creatures which appeared unnatural.Now for Jar-Jar Binks. Let's face it, you either like him or hate him. I personally found him an ok addition. I would have liked him more if he and his race spoke without that jibberish dialect and a little less of the slapstick clumsy comedy would have definitely done Jar-Jar's character more justice.The plot has come under criticism but I found it simplistic like the other three Star Wars movies which is not a bad thing at all. At least one can sit down and enjoy the movie rather than have to think through a movie about what people did or said earlier on. And whilst on speech, yes, the script was light on and over done with the force cliches. But overall the plot and the dialogue was ok.I can't understand critics saying TPM was boring. They must have been asleep that's all I can say. The fight scenes were great. Especially the final fight sequence accompanied by some fantastic classical music. And if that didn't capture your eye, as I previously mentioned, the pure creation of these cities are incredible. The pod race was also exciting but I must agree with critics who say it was a Ben Hur chariot race Star Wars style.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"15 June 1999","score":"","review":"  I tried very hard not to dislike this movie but found it almost impossible to do so. From the very start I couldn't believe in the story that it was trying to sell us. And by the end, when Anna Scott asked William to love her like an ordinary girl, it just became too tough a lump to swallow because the whole movie had been built around the fact that she is NOT an ordinary girl. As a fairy tale the movie doesn't click for me because there were such a lot of mismatched elements; elements that do not belong in a fairy tale. Starting from the very notion that a temperamental international movie star will find lifelong marital bliss with a rather befuddled London storekeeper.This movie can't run away from being compared to Four Weddings and A Funeral and maybe it should be. I really liked Four Weddings and A Funeral for its comic energy and its zany but likeable characters who were all really good folks at heart. And I liked Hugh Grant there as a fumbling charmer who follows his heart in the end after a few misfires. The story of boy meets extraordinary girl but is afraid to commit reminds us of our own choices. We know what we want, sometimes we even know what is good for us but we are afraid to try and get it.Notting Hill is the story of boy meets movie star but is afraid to commit. This time around I think he has very valid reasons not to commit but all that is lost in the frenetic and overdramatic last 15 minutes. From the very beginning, it seemed highly improbable that a worldly seen-it-all woman like Anna Scott would kiss a stranger who has just spilt juice on her. Taking that huge leap required me to hoist my disbelief up to dizzying heights for the rest of the movie. Before that, there was also the nagging thought that a movie star like Anna would actually agree to follow a strange man into his house and change her clothes there.While the supporting cast in Four Weddings was endearingly quirky, the bunch here seemed a pale shadow of their predecessors. In Notting Hill, they are weird for the sake of being weird. The roommate Spike was all too predictable, a one dimensional comic relief who had no depth, no redeeming qualities that would help us understand why the younger sister would fall in love with him. And the pain of watching Honey make a fool of herself the first time she meets Anna only substantiated the fact that this story never intended for us to see Anna as a mere mortal.And because of the movie star aura obstructing our vision, we never really find out whether Anna is a nice suitable match for William, assuming that all he wants is a nice suitable soulmate for himself as he did in Four Weddings. The writer tries to convince us that Anna is a nice person by throwing at us really deviant blind date types like the woman who wouldn't eat a cooked vegetable. William never gets a chance to develop a normal relationship with any of these dates before Anna started imposing herself on him again.What do we know about Anna? She is a movie star, she is gorgeous, she doesn't have any bad habits, she can talk nicely to a bunch of people around a dinner table and she inexplicably likes William enough to sleep with him. What do we know about Anna when she tries to be an ordinary girl? She can't stand people criticizing her even though she's been in show biz for the last ten years, she is a very career minded professional who doesn't stay in one place a whole lot, she doesn't stand up for William when her boyfriend mistreats him, she throws a tantrum when her public life interferes with her romance and starts blaming everyone else, she leaves William in limbo without even calling him to try and clear things up after that episode. To cap it all off, she comes back and asks William to accept her.The last decision was of course William's to make. And what about William? He is portrayed as being very ordinary. He is supposed to be an average man with no bad habits, a handsome face and no girlfriend although he owns a store in one of the busiest parts of London where people from all over the world traipse through daily. He is apparently no overachiever and is satisfied with his routine life, traveling no more than a few hundred  yards a day from his home to his shop and back. Then he has the world's most famous movie star falling in love with him. He gets to know her personally for a total of not more than 48 hours.Last of all, I pity Hugh Grant for getting stuck in stuttering roles for the rest of his career.

Starting from the very notion that a temperamental international movie star will find lifelong marital bliss with a rather befuddled London storekeeper.This movie can't run away from being compared to Four Weddings and A Funeral and maybe it should be. I really liked Four Weddings and A Funeral for its comic energy and its zany but likeable characters who were all really good folks at heart. And I liked Hugh Grant there as a fumbling charmer who follows his heart in the end after a few misfires. The story of boy meets extraordinary girl but is afraid to commit reminds us of our own choices. We know what we want, sometimes we even know what is good for us but we are afraid to try and get it.Notting Hill is the story of boy meets movie star but is afraid to commit. This time around I think he has very valid reasons not to commit but all that is lost in the frenetic and overdramatic last 15 minutes. From the very beginning, it seemed highly improbable that a worldly seen-it-all woman like Anna Scott would kiss a stranger who has just spilt juice on her. Taking that huge leap required me to hoist my disbelief up to dizzying heights for the rest of the movie. Before that, there was also the nagging thought that a movie star like Anna would actually agree to follow a strange man into his house and change her clothes there.While the supporting cast in Four Weddings was endearingly quirky, the bunch here seemed a pale shadow of their predecessors. In Notting Hill, they are weird for the sake of being weird. The roommate Spike was all too predictable, a one dimensional comic relief who had no depth, no redeeming qualities that would help us understand why the younger sister would fall in love with him. And the pain of watching Honey make a fool of herself the first time she meets Anna only substantiated the fact that this story never intended for us to see Anna as a mere mortal.And because of the movie star aura obstructing our vision, we never really find out whether Anna is a nice suitable match for William, assuming that all he wants is a nice suitable soulmate for himself as he did in Four Weddings. The writer tries to convince us that Anna is a nice person by throwing at us really deviant blind date types like the woman who wouldn't eat a cooked vegetable. William never gets a chance to develop a normal relationship with any of these dates before Anna started imposing herself on him again.What do we know about Anna? She is a movie star, she is gorgeous, she doesn't have any bad habits, she can talk nicely to a bunch of people around a dinner table and she inexplicably likes William enough to sleep with him. What do we know about Anna when she tries to be an ordinary girl? She can't stand people criticizing her even though she's been in show biz for the last ten years, she is a very career minded professional who doesn't stay in one place a whole lot, she doesn't stand up for William when her boyfriend mistreats him, she throws a tantrum when her public life interferes with her romance and starts blaming everyone else, she leaves William in limbo without even calling him to try and clear things up after that episode. To cap it all off, she comes back and asks William to accept her.The last decision was of course William's to make. And what about William? He is portrayed as being very ordinary. He is supposed to be an average man with no bad habits, a handsome face and no girlfriend although he owns a store in one of the busiest parts of London where people from all over the world traipse through daily. He is apparently no overachiever and is satisfied with his routine life, traveling no more than a few hundred  yards a day from his home to his shop and back. Then he has the world's most famous movie star falling in love with him. He gets to know her personally for a total of not more than 48 hours.Last of all, I pity Hugh Grant for getting stuck in stuttering roles for the rest of his career.
