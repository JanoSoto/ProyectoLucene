I have never been so impacted by a film before. My eyes stayed wide open with shock the entire film. Lee Tamahori did a great job directing this film it is truly amazing and very sad. Just the first scene caught my eyes. It starts with the camera on a billboard with beautiful mountains and luscious lands and the words tourist attraction then it drifts down to a ghettoish area with dirty streets and graffiti. The land that once was great; the Mauri land was colonized. The Heke family is really messed up. The absence of a true father and mother figure and the lack of love really affect each of their children emotionally and physically. There were many ways of embracing a new colonized land that has deprived your spirit such as through gangs, personal morals, abuse, and alcohol. This movie shows it all. It really saddens me that the father who is stuck in the past worrying about the Mauri and how he was nothing lets his family get the worst of him. Also he subjects his children and wife to danger, which is really disheartening especially when Grace gets personally attacked under his watchful eye, which leads to her death. I believe through the course of this film the mother, Beth, starts to understand and feels guilt for have abandoning her children and was trying to reconnect. The only way to change would have to leave the place that has been the source of evil and if it wasn't for Grace dying I don't believe Beth would have ever been able to get her family out away from the abusive and alcoholic father. The Mauri traditions seem to be very warrior oriented whether it is the tattoos you wear on your face like Nig, or like Boogie who had to leave of the house and got put into welfare. It was the best thing for him. He got in touch with his culture and he grew as a person. The ending when Beth grows and decides to leave with the close up of her face in the dark night with the light shining through really shows her inner warrior because when I think of a warrior that is the exact image that comes into my head. She has defeated the beast and it is now time to go home. This movie is tragic and yet heroic. It was a real eye opener. ","genre":null},{"date":"15 December 2011","score":"","review":" Wow!

Unfortunately I'm a guy who yearns for a little excitement every now and then. The truth of the matter is that I really wanted to like this film.

I actually thought that Will Geer and Stefan Gierasch gave the more memorable performances here. But all this is a moot point because the whole affair is so dreadfully dull and pointless. Man meets some good Indians, man meets some bad Indians, man marries a good Indian, man wanders around the solitary landscape, man builds a house, bad Indians destroy said house, man wanders some more, etc. And all done with minimum dialogue. For large swathes of this film you feel like you're watching a silent movie. And none of what I saw I could engage in. I just flat out didn't care.

Sydney Pollock really divides me - at times he can create very good stuff like THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and THE YAKUZA and at other times he gives me coma-inducing stuff like this and OUT OF Africa.

It's still a very solid movie with that meticulous Hitchcock touch in every scene - the way Hitch's production team recreated that whole apartment complex on the back lot and the classic camera movements of cinematographer Robert Burks. But I was a bit less impressed with it this time around and I noticed some guffaws that I didn't notice before. The film actually feels a bit too long - especially for a film which consists of a single set and of a guy sitting in a wheelchair and spying on his neighbors for the entire run-time. I mean it has the run-time of your typical Bond film. I think 30 minutes could have easily been cut and it would have made for a tighter picture.Then there is the rather far-fetched idea that a girl like Grace Kelly is basically throwing herself at the feet of Grampa Jimmy Stewart who is just a sour puss and wants to do nothing but look through his binoculars the whole day. I really didn't notice this laughable concept the first time around for some odd reason. I mean just one look at Grace Kelly would have cured me immediately. Voila!! Leg instantly healed!!

People love to take shots at this movie. And to be fair there are some things here which deserve a good mocking. John Travolta's unfortunate haircut. Halle Berry's infamous gratuitous topless scene. Hugh Jackman's silly little computer hacking dance. And there's the big final action sequence which is ridiculous. Actually ridiculous probably isn't strong enough a word for it but that's the best I can come up with at the moment. But despite all this nonsense, and a convoluted plot which the director never manages to sufficiently untangle, the movie is actually reasonably entertaining. There's plenty wrong with it but the movie does enough things right to make it, if not a clear success, at least a decent effort.The movie begins with an opening sequence which is actually rather brilliant. Travolta sits at a table and gives a speech about Hollywood, media and the response to a Dog Day Afternoon type situation. Then he, and a rather confused looking Jackman, walk outside and lo and behold we've got ourselves a Dog Day Afternoon type situation. A bank heist apparently gone quite wrong, hostages, SWAT teams, chaos. Then things explode. Literally. What the heck is going on here? We're as confused as Jackman appears to be. And then we flash back four days. And begin to piece together how exactly we got to this explosive opening we just witnessed.At this point we still have no idea who Travolta and Jackman's characters are. We learn about Jackman's guy first. He's Stanley Jobson, a renowned computer hacker who spent time in prison for infecting an FBI program with a virus. He's got a daughter who his estranged wife won't allow him to see or speak to. All he wants is his daughter back in his life. Ginger, played by Berry, shows up with a proposition. Who's Ginger? Who knows. She's a mystery. She offers Stanley $100,000 just to fly to Los Angeles to meet with her boss. Who's her boss? That's a bigger mystery. The boss turns out to be Travolta of course. Gabriel is the character's name and that's pretty much all we're ever going to know about him. What's he up to, whose side is he on, good guy or bad guy? The movie goes to great pains to keep us guessing. Anyhow Gabriel offers Stanley 10 million dollars to write a worm to steal some government money. 10 million bucks will go a long way towards getting your daughter back so Stanley's in and away we go. The plot twists and turns, often rather confusingly, as it heads back towards that opening scene. Along the way Berry sunbathes topless in a truly pointless scene that earned her an extra $500,000. Nice work if you can get it. When the movie catches up to its opening will all be sufficiently explained? Not really. Is the movie consistently entertaining throughout? Not really. But despite its flaws the movie works just well enough to be worthwhile. It's no great movie by any means. It's not particularly memorable, it's not a movie you'll want to watch again and again. But as cheap, disposable entertainment you could do a lot worse. So many people seem to hate this movie. But it's not bad. Not great, but not that bad at all.

In October I set out to watch the greatest scary movies ever made. Searching the internet I found a list of 50 movies that included the Wicker Man. The synopsis suggested it had potential to be good but in watching it I learned the opposite.The Wicker Man is one of the worst films ever made (more disturbingly, Hollywood decided to remake it with Nicholas Cage decades later). As a horror, mystery, thriller, or any other genre it fails. Even if you were to watch it as a comedy, given how bad it is, you would be disappointed given how dull it is and how its cheesiness just gets on your nerves rather than making you laugh.Filmed largely in daylight, full of singing & dancing, lots of nudity while singing & dancing, and with the villains being too weird to unnerve the audience, there is absolutely nothing scary about say 99% of the movie.Then comes the ending which has a slight touch of horror but it is not enough to redeem the movie and in fact makes the viewer even angrier with the makers of the film. Basically, the main character (Sgt. Howie) is a Christian police officer who goes to an island where a little girl has gone missing to investigate. He encounters a pagan populace worshiping ancient deities and comes to a the conclusion that the girl is to be the blood sacrifice to appease the gods and make the crop yields better next year.The surprise at the end of the movie is that HE is to be the victim and the girl even helps to entrap him when he goes to rescue her at the ceremony at the end. In that moment you the viewer feel a great deal of sympathy for Sergeant Howie as he is dragged off by these deluded townspeople to be burned alive in a Wicker Man along with various animals in cages. Christopher Lee's character, Lord Summerisle, has pushed this ritual since he fears his town will sacrifice him if the crops fail the next year.This moment is the only good part of the movie but it comes after suffering through nearly an hour and a half of utter crap. There is no suspense until the final moments and because of this you merely feel cheated AND furious at the dark ending. To be frank, the townspeople are extremely irritating and the Sergeant is an idiot (five minutes after arriving in the plane he knew something was wrong with these people yet he went UNARMED to the blood sacrifice to save the girl).This movie could have been saved if as he was being surrounded, Sergeant Howie said 6 words Good thing I brought my gun! That would have made the film a bit more like its distant cousin, Hot Fuzz. That is what Wicker Man is An old version of Hot Fuzz with none of the qualities that make that movie a classic.In closing, if you want a good movie with a small town conspiracy, try the comedies Hot Fuzz & Waking Ned Devine, the horror flicks Population 436 & Sleepy Hollow, or even the television series Twin Peaks.

What makes this film so disturbing is the somewhat funny and fake over-the-top beginning being juxtaposed with the really harsh and realistic ending leaves a really chilling impact on you. What makes it all the more disturbing is that this actually happened, and apparently one of the friends is a celebrated crime novelist living in Scotland!The visuals are eye-catching and really go deep into the twisted minds of these really, almost too close, friends. One is played by Kate Winslet (in her first every role woo!) and the other is some unknown Aussie (or should I say New Zealander) both play their parts really well. Everyone is over-the-top for the most part and it really does work. Peter Jackson invites us in to their friendship and we as an audience sort of begin to understand what the girls are like and the horrors of the ever being apart.The screenplay is extremely impressive, with the interesting narration from the girl's actual diary. But, what's most impressive is Peter Jackson's directing. When the film comes to it's climax (the whole film is a build-up which is what makes it so clever and interesting) I really did feel nervous for the mother, she just seemed like such a typical mother and Peter puts us into their shoes so you can only imagine what the girl's are thinking. I was left bemused and shocked. The murder is so realistically done it's frightening and left me cold. That's why I can't give it no less than a 10\/10.Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures is a highly unusual, but extremely absorbing psychological drama. It keeps you fixed on their friendship until the very last scene. I think it is a film that will certainly stick with me thanks to it's striking visuals and intelligent screenplay. Peter shows us that he can't only just do fun, mindless, gorefests, but he can also do disturbing, mature, dramas (with some hilarious comedy as well.) If you see Heavenly Creatures on BBC1. Hit record! ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"15 December 2011","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" On the Waterfront is kind of like Crash. Both movies are contrived, meaning that the situations are not organic, but they're forced for the soul sake of moving the movie to it's conclusion. Elia Kazan was a very good director, and there will always be a controversial opinion on how he named names with the HUAC in 1952 until the end of time. The Real source to blame in that situation was the HUAC, as if we were all in the Salem Witch Trials or something, those buffoons.However, Kazan did what he did, it hurt his career, but I still don't look at his career with that involved, I look at his career on his filmmaking only, and whether I think he had no backbone doesn't matter to me when I'm critiquing one of his films. I just really didn't care for On the Waterfront that much. It's not that good.I'm not a huge fan of Casablanca either but I can see where it makes the AFI 100 best films list, it's a pioneer movie that paved the way for many movies that were made then and now. But On the Waterfront isn't a pioneer of any kind, nothing new had been utilized.High Noon,in a way, has a similar story as On the Waterfront accept for the 'being a stool pigeon' or a 'D&D'(No not Dungeons and Dragons)factor in On the Waterfront. I would recommend watching High Noon instead, it's a better story, it flows more naturally and is more believable about the circumstances that are going on, and also I believe universally anyone can identify with High Noon.Kazan liked to relate to the films he did, if he didn't relate to them he usually didn't do them. One can see why Brando's character Malloy rats them out (I mean, they killed his brother and they were just the cliché bad guys). But if Kazan was trying to make what he did in 1952 with the HUAC seem justified in anyway, then he failed, not quite the same, not at all.Then the kids kill all of Malloy's pigeons, they killed all of them for him being a rat! 'Yeah I guess ratting out a guy who is a psychopathic, controlling murderer who killed my brother isn't really a cool thing to do' \/ Some of the common sense goes out the window in this movie and there seems, again, a lot of forced situations, a lot of holes and gaps.If you're going to watch On the Waterfront, then the good things about the movie are as follows Kazan's eye is very good, Brando is terrific and now I see why, when Rocky came out in 1976, critics were saying Sylvester Stallone was the next Brando because Brando plays a slightly different version of Rocky in this movie.Brando was amazing, and in my opinion, one of the top five best actors in our lifetime. The rest of the acting is exceptional and that's why I'm giving this movie the rating I'm giving it, based predominately off the acting and directing. Oh, can't forget to mention Rod Steiger either, he's always fun to watch, terrific actor as well.

The iconic roles of the book are mostly filled by Muppets(Kermit as Bob Cratchit, Ms. Piggy as his wife, etc.)but Scrooge himself is portrayed rather well by Michael Cane. You should be well aware of the story of A Christmas Carol by now, a man is viewed as a miserable, greedy miser and is visited by three ghosts who show him his past, present and future. Little by little he becomes a better man through these visions and ultimately turns his life around for the better. The same applies for this movie. Only there's a lot of humor you'll find in a Muppet movie. Fourth wall jokes, slapstick, the usual brand of Muppet style. But some of the dialog is actually taken from the original book, and the themes of redemption and good will toward men are still present. One thing that makes the movie a good adaption is that the three ghosts were originally created Muppets just for this movie. Being a Muppet movie there are a few songs in it but they're all done very well and don't seem to slow down the plot(at least for me).The Muppets really captured the tone of the original story for me and I really love this version. I recommend it to any fan of the original book , or fans of the Muppets or just about everyone. While I can't guarantee everyone will love it, it's at least worth a watch.
