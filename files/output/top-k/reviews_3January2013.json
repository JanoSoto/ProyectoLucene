It was full of action and kept you wondering what was going to happen next. The cast list was very good, for this movie. Marshal Kane, played by Gary Cooper, and his wife Amy Kane, played by Grace Kelly, had a good chemistry on set that was noticeable. Also, leading up to the climax was suspenseful. Even though I could tell what was about to happen, in some parts of the movie, it was still exciting. Gary Cooper showed how much he loved his town. You could also tell that Grace Kelly cared too; she just couldn't bear to see anything bad happen. Katy Jurado did a good job at being fierce and showing no sadness in her decision to leave. The music in this movie won an academy award! For each plot twist the music changed and it set the mood for what was about to happen. It helped me understand more of what was happening. The way the cameras were mostly focused on an individual person, or just that persons face. I think they should have shown more of what was around the characters.I think theme of this movie was to tell the viewers that violence is not an option. The movie showed that you shouldn't seek revenge over something that happened a while ago. Also that you should stand up for what you believe in or to stand up for something you love. The best part of the movie was when Amy and Marshal Kane got married. Her dress was really pretty and everyone was celebrating for them. Another good part of the movie was when Amy Kane decided to get off of the train with Katy to help Marshal and be with him. Eventually she was put in the same situation as Marshal, and was put at gunpoint. She did the best she could to get the criminal off of her, and was saved by her husband.

Since the character gripped most people's attention, he had his own comic book series which was named Amazing Spider-Man and from that point on, Spider-Man became one of the most popular superheroes around to this day.When this film came out, people were stoked! The action, the cast, it was just a phenomenal flick! It sounds like Sam Raimi nailed it right? All is good in the land of Spider-Man. Unfortunately, no...I wanted to come out here and say that. While I don't think that it's bad per say, I don't it's the strongest out of Marvel's works either. I'm a big fan of Spider-Man comics and I've been reading them ever since I was about 5 years old and as a result, I wasn't allowed to see this film due to the fact it was rated 12 back in those times. But I'll tell you why that this film is not the best comic book adaptation ever made.The plot revolves around the main character Peter Parker. He goes to a genetics laboratory where he gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider and gains spider-like abilities. He goes to a wrestling to get money to buy a car to impress the love of his life Mary Jane Watson. The promoter cheated him off but got robbed, Peter lets the robber go but doing so caused his Uncle Ben's life; he catches him and learn what Uncle Ben told him. Meanwhile, the owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn tries to preserve his military contract for his company because losing it will mean the end of his business. He goes to desperate measures as he experiments on himself with his company's new but unstable performing enhancing chemical paper that increases his speed, strength and stamina. Doing so allows him to go insane and he kills his board members at the world unity fair. Spider-Man and the Green Goblin encounter each other a few times and it's your simple good vs. evil story.First, I'll start with the casting. I'm so sorry but I don't like Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker. He was terrible in that role. Peter Parker is suppose to be this shy nerd and while he is a nerd, he does not act like a wimp in the comics. Peter is suppose to be smart, clever, witty and sarcastic and Tobey Maguire to be honest doesn't get across those apropriate aspects. He's also not good at doing emotional scenes like when he cries over Uncle Ben let's be honest. Also, when he gets bitten by the spider, he's suppose to have the ability to run fast and jump higher, then he builds his own web shooters. In this film however, they are natural, it just comes out of his wrist for some reason. Very odd...Instead of having Gwen Stacy as the love interest, we have Mary Jane Watson. I know that Peter and Mary Jane get together in the comics considering that I read them but Gwen Stacy was suppose to be his first love. Not only that, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane makes me want to face palm, especially the dialogue that was written for her. Not to mention Gwen Stacy was suppose to be in that big climax where the Green Goblin let her go to fall to her death as it was done in the comics.Now onto Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn. He's not a bad choice to play Norman Osborn, he really looks like the part. But with his over the top performance as the Goblin, it gets really annoying. Plus, the costume is ridiculous and is not like the original comic book design. Are we suppose to take him seriously like that? Just by making him look like he's from the Power Rangers?Another thing that I would like to talk about is James Franco as Harry Osborn. I think he was underused throughout most of the film. When we get down to the end of the film, he now has a purpose to be in the trilogy. The script was written by David Koepp. He wrote both the story and the dialogue for this film, he's more of storyteller than a dialogue writer. I think he was trying to go for the comic books but it's suppose to be a comic book adaptation that takes it seriously. Now onto the good points. The action sequences were fun to look at. Granted, the special effects were terrible like they were cutscenes straight from an early PS2 Game but they were good for their time. Sure, Spider-Man looked like a cartoon while web-swinging but it was 2002 so I'll give it a pass.I liked the performances by Rosemary Harris as May Parker even though her dialogue was pretty bad. I just loved J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson! He was just SPOT...ON! He played the character perfectly like the J. Jonah Jameson in the Amazing Spider-Man comic book series!I also really liked the music composed by Danny Elfman. The theme really sticks to my head even to this day! Plus, we have a brief but good cameo from Spider-Man co-creater Stan The Man Lee. Aside from the flaws I mentioned, I think the story was OK, simple and straightforward. Overall, I say Spider-Man was OK. It's not that great, it's just overrated. Just because I liked it doesn't everything in this film was good. I like the action sequences, I like the soundtracks and the cast that really stand out the most for me was James Franco, Rosemary Harris and J.K Simmons. General audience who never read The Amazing Spider-Man comics will be totally amused by this film but Spider-Man and comic book fans will be disappointed. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 January 2013","score":"","review":" Spider-Man is a superhero that was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and was published by Marvel Comics making his first appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15 in 1962.

The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. Jumanji is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.

The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. Jumanji is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that.

Of course I had to order all the films off of ebay or be lucky enough to find one at the video store, but this was easy to have seen. As a child I was completely thrilled by this film and even cried at the ending when I was young, but have since turned my back on to it after I read all these reviews hating it, what were they looking for, the meaning of life? Get real it's a monster movie. I finally picked up the Blu-ray and I must say it was still a blast, I recommend the Blu-ray, it enhances the action scenes very well. Sure the characters were mediocre and the dialogue is a hit or a miss, but I can look past that. The visual's still look decent and the special effects are cool to see. This film is not a Godzilla film, he is very different from the original, mainly he can be injured from missiles. I kind of like his design here, it's not bad. The ending was a set up to a sequel that never happened. But of course there was the animated series. I would have loved a sequel were he fought another monster. Comparing the two Godzilla's is a no brain'er, the Japanese one is superior in every way. I could go on for a few more paragraphs of talking about this, but instead I'm going to cut it short. It's a fun movie and is very entertaining. Give it a watch, but keep in mind it's just a monster movie and should not be viewed as anything else.

Not even the movie could gather my interest.I'm a bit older now and a lot more educated, so it was time to really take in this treasured film. And wow, what a difference a few years makes. This film, extraordinarily faithful to the source, grabs the atmosphere and setting of the film and spells it out on screen. TKAM is a wonderful story of adult issues through a child's eyes, under the watchful eye of moral hero Atticus Finch.In just over two hours the effects of the Depression in the South is seen, as well as the lingering racism and prejudice of the Civil War, the vivid imagination of children and the effect a strong parent can have on children. The themes have very positive stances this is no Grapes of Wrath. The film is family-friendly except for several contextual uses of the N- word.Though it is a positive film, it is not an easy viewing. Like any great example of any medium, To Kill A Mockingbird is dense and not extremely easy to follow, due in part to its age and content- there's virtually no action and the one true scene of physical conflict is weak compared to the rest of the film. Another way to say it is that if you have a meeting with a film buff and you want to appear smart but haven't seen many classic films, don't start with this one. I remember seeing the AFI's Heroes and Villains list and being a little put off by Atticus' place... but I can't now.

For some people, the few who enjoy classic cowboy films, High Noon fills out every quality to make it a perfectly fine Western. However, I am not one of those particular people. To start with, the characters were sporadic in personalities and decision. They surprised you with sudden acts of courage and fear, leaving and staying. I grew to dislike many of the characters. Amy Fowler, wife of protagonist Will Kane, was one in particular. Her ultimatum of leaving on the train, with or without her new husband, was selfish and did not strike me as very loving or devoted. She was over-dramatic, jumped to conclusions quickly, and failed to gain my liking.The effects bothered me too. Perhaps, from having grown up in a generation with movies advanced in their special effects, I do not know how to fully appreciate classic films and their antique stunts and tricks. A man would shoot rounds of bullets at another man and the bullets would simply land about his feet, coming nowhere near a killing point, unless it was one exact shot killing from the head or heart, in which case it only took that single shot. Some of the acting was second-rate as well. Corny reactions, bad Southern accents, and off dramatization made the movie less than the potential it could have had. Overall, these problems I found are opinion-related to myself. The people watching High Noon, sitting across the room from me, could have been having the time of their life, and that is absolutely fine.

Yes, it's built on movie-making clichés, it manipulates the viewer, and there are excesses and improbabilities. And yes, in fact, it is on some level kind of trashy. But it's extremely well made trash in the hands of director Joel Schumacher. And when you deal with contemporary race relations in Mississippi through a capital murder trial you end up at the extremes of society. All of what happens here makes sense and reveals some remaining strains of bigotry, violence, and personal blindness in society. I don't like the underlying moral logic much, but if you can appreciate American vigilante revenge (I can't, even though it happens in a lot of convincing movies), you'll click with the message here, too.It might slightly help to remember this made a little more sense in 1996. Or maybe 1986, which is when the book was being written. Oddly, and wonderfully, the movie feels like something that wouldn't happen in 2013, when I saw it. Maybe in some ways all of this could still take similar vague form, and I have not doubt about racism being alive in kicking in many places around the country, but what happens here is meant to be the vestiges from 20 years ago of what was once commonplace in the south. Hopefully last vestiges.A cinematic strength here beyond the story of a black man in an essentially white justice system is the rich cast. There are something like seven major stars in various roles, from Matthew McConaughey as the leading defense lawyer who does a good job to Ashley Judd as his wife who isn't given much to do or say and who is surprisingly canned. There is Donald Sutherland as the wise renegade (and disbarred) old lawyer who helps from the background (rather like Preminger's 1959 Anatomy of Murder) and his son Kiefer as a crazed neo-KKK bigot with a quick tendency to cruelty. Somewhere between is the perp and eventual hero to some played with decent intensity by Samuel L. Jackson, and the bright smart-alecky law clerk in the form of Sandra Bullock. Throw in Kevin Spacey as the haughty D.A and Patrick McGoohan of all people (he's the lead in the great 1960s t.v. series, The Prisoner) as the judge. Both are terrific.Expect lots of interwoven plots, lots of violence against lots of innocent people, and some speechmaking about how to achieve justice and find the best in people. The movie is designed to make you approve of the revenge killings near the start of the movie, revenge by a father after the brutal rape and torture of his 10 year old daughter. The key defense hinges on the idea that any father would have done the same. It's justifiable homicide.But to appreciate this is to turn a blind eye to the fact that there might never be such a thing as justifiable homicide. I mean, that's what lynching is based on--and so what one person calls justified is what another calls senseless vendetta-based murderous sin. And the underlying message is that if someone commits a bad enough crime they deserve to die. Without a trial. This is what drives the movie and makes you take sides. It's almost impossible to side with the prosecutor, who makes the simple case that you don't kill people in cold blood in our society. But the common folk of the jury are all twelve swayed in the final four minutes by a heartwrenching and unlikely speech by our young lawyer hero. The KKK finds its comeuppance. The new South is apparently just starting to see the problem with its centuries of racism.The more I write the more I realize the movie is almost shameful. But a well-acted, well directed bit of movie-making shame. Yes it's worth seeing, no matter which side of the morality you are on. It is, to be sure, by the same director who gave us Falling Down, if you remember that other justification of revenge violence. It is also, luckily, a condemnation of racism in many forms.

Yes, it's built on movie-making clichés, it manipulates the viewer, and there are excesses and improbabilities. And yes, in fact, it is on some level kind of trashy. But it's extremely well made trash in the hands of director Joel Schumacher. And when you deal with contemporary race relations in Mississippi through a capital murder trial you end up at the extremes of society. All of what happens here makes sense and reveals some remaining strains of bigotry, violence, and personal blindness in society. I don't like the underlying moral logic much, but if you can appreciate American vigilante revenge (I can't, even though it happens in a lot of convincing movies), you'll click with the message here, too.It might slightly help to remember this made a little more sense in 1996. Or maybe 1986, which is when the book was being written. Oddly, and wonderfully, the movie feels like something that wouldn't happen in 2013, when I saw it. Maybe in some ways all of this could still take similar vague form, and I have not doubt about racism being alive in kicking in many places around the country, but what happens here is meant to be the vestiges from 20 years ago of what was once commonplace in the south. Hopefully last vestiges.A cinematic strength here beyond the story of a black man in an essentially white justice system is the rich cast. There are something like seven major stars in various roles, from Matthew McConaughey as the leading defense lawyer who does a good job to Ashley Judd as his wife who isn't given much to do or say and who is surprisingly canned. There is Donald Sutherland as the wise renegade (and disbarred) old lawyer who helps from the background (rather like Preminger's 1959 Anatomy of Murder) and his son Kiefer as a crazed neo-KKK bigot with a quick tendency to cruelty. Somewhere between is the perp and eventual hero to some played with decent intensity by Samuel L. Jackson, and the bright smart-alecky law clerk in the form of Sandra Bullock. Throw in Kevin Spacey as the haughty D.A and Patrick McGoohan of all people (he's the lead in the great 1960s t.v. series, The Prisoner) as the judge. Both are terrific.Expect lots of interwoven plots, lots of violence against lots of innocent people, and some speechmaking about how to achieve justice and find the best in people. The movie is designed to make you approve of the revenge killings near the start of the movie, revenge by a father after the brutal rape and torture of his 10 year old daughter. The key defense hinges on the idea that any father would have done the same. It's justifiable homicide.But to appreciate this is to turn a blind eye to the fact that there might never be such a thing as justifiable homicide. I mean, that's what lynching is based on--and so what one person calls justified is what another calls senseless vendetta-based murderous sin. And the underlying message is that if someone commits a bad enough crime they deserve to die. Without a trial. This is what drives the movie and makes you take sides.

It's a Wonderful Life is one of a number of such films from this period; others include Portrait of Jennie, The Ghost and Mrs Muir, One Touch of Venus and, from Britain, A Matter of Life and Death and Pandora and the Flying Dutchman.This is also an early example of the Christmas film, a genre which has today become ten-a-penny. The main action takes place on Christmas Eve and it was first released on December 20th 1946. The film was originally a disappointment at the box-office, but quickly became one of the most loved films in American cinema, and the tradition has grown up of showing it on television during the Christmas season. The plot has something in common with that other Christmas classic, A Christmas Carol, although it might be truer to say that It's a Wonderful Life is A Christmas Carol in reverse. Dickens' story tells the story of a selfish, greedy man who is saved from greed and selfishness by supernatural intervention. Frank Capra's film rather tells the story of a man who has tried to live a selfless life but who needs to be saved from despair when he comes to believe himself a failure. The film also figures, in Henry Potter, an antagonist who has similarities with the unreformed Ebenezer Scrooge. George Bailey is the manager of a small Building and Loan Association in the small New England town of Bedford Falls. We see his life told in a series of flashbacks. George was originally a man of lofty ambitions who, as a boy, dreamed of becoming a famous explorer and later wanted to be a great architect or engineer. The early death of his father, however, led to him taking over management of the Building and Loan, a business which his idealistic father had started with the express intention of helping the ordinary people of Bedford Falls to build or buy homes at moderate rates of interest. George, however, faces opposition from his arch-enemy Potter, a rapacious slum landlord and grasping capitalist businessman; Potter hates the Building and Loan because it can undercut the extortionate rates charged by his own bank. Potter's dishonest machinations lead to the Building and Loan facing insolvency and George himself facing criminal charges of embezzlement. In despair, George resolves to commit suicide. What saves him is the intervention of his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody who, by showing George how different life in his community would be had he never been born, persuades him that he has done an immense amount of good in his life and that life is worth living. The above synopsis could have formed the basis of a horribly sentimental story, and the film is not entirely free of sentimentality, particularly in its idealised view of small-town life and its treatment of the courtship of George and his wife Mary. The picture drawn by Clarence of what Bedford Falls would be like had George never lived also seems exaggerated; the town, renamed Pottersville, is dominated by Potter, who has filled it with sleazy nightclubs, gambling joints, pawn shops and bars. Its people are cynical, selfish and immoral. It struck me as rather extreme to suggest that the life of one good man was all that stood between Potter and his ambition of turning Bedford Falls into the Las Vegas of the North-East. (For one thing, small-town businessmen, however corrupt and unscrupulous, do not generally possess the political muscle to overturn State anti-gambling laws).What saves the film from turning into pure treacle is the characterisation of the two main roles. Angels have traditionally been portrayed as young, beautiful, all-wise and androgynous, but Clarence is an elderly man who is not even very good at his job. He has been in Heaven for two hundred years, but has not yet earned his wings- according to the film angels are only given their wings after performing some meritorious deed- and his mission to save George is his chance to redeem himself. Although George may be an idealist, he is not idealised, and is far from flawless; he can, for example, be bad-tempered. It is the interaction between these two characters, Henry Travers' shambling, kindly, eccentric angel and James Stewart's flawed, frustrated idealist which lies at the heart of the film. Both actors are excellent, and Stewart earned a Best Actor nomination. Donna Reed is rather bland as the impossibly perfect Mary, but there is another memorable contribution from Lionel Barrymore as Potter. Stewart and Barrymore had earlier worked together with Capra in his You Can't Take It with You, and Stewart had appeared in his Mr Smith Goes to Washington. Capra was born in Italy, but became an ardent patriot for his adopted country, and many of his films celebrate what he considered to be American values. (Mr Smith Goes to Washington is another example).The lasting popularity of It's a Wonderful Life can perhaps be attributed to its quiet celebration of small-town values, of basic decency, of friendship, of generosity, of idealism, of community spirit and of faith in a benevolent providence. Yet Capra is not afraid to criticise other cherished American values- the figure of Potter can be taken as a critique of untrammeled free-market capitalism- nor to face up to the darker side of life, to despair, to selfishness and to villainy. The false values of Pottersville may have been vanquished in Bedford Falls, but as audiences in 1946 would have been aware, those values still prevailed in many real-life communities. In the contest between good and evil, victory can never be taken for granted. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 January 2013","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Supernatural fantasies were popular on both sides of the Atlantic during the late forties and early fifties, possibly because the heavy death toll during World War II had made people think about the possibility of an afterlife.

Its people are cynical, selfish and immoral. It struck me as rather extreme to suggest that the life of one good man was all that stood between Potter and his ambition of turning Bedford Falls into the Las Vegas of the North-East. (For one thing, small-town businessmen, however corrupt and unscrupulous, do not generally possess the political muscle to overturn State anti-gambling laws).What saves the film from turning into pure treacle is the characterisation of the two main roles. Angels have traditionally been portrayed as young, beautiful, all-wise and androgynous, but Clarence is an elderly man who is not even very good at his job. He has been in Heaven for two hundred years, but has not yet earned his wings- according to the film angels are only given their wings after performing some meritorious deed- and his mission to save George is his chance to redeem himself. Although George may be an idealist, he is not idealised, and is far from flawless; he can, for example, be bad-tempered. It is the interaction between these two characters, Henry Travers' shambling, kindly, eccentric angel and James Stewart's flawed, frustrated idealist which lies at the heart of the film. Both actors are excellent, and Stewart earned a Best Actor nomination. Donna Reed is rather bland as the impossibly perfect Mary, but there is another memorable contribution from Lionel Barrymore as Potter. Stewart and Barrymore had earlier worked together with Capra in his You Can't Take It with You, and Stewart had appeared in his Mr Smith Goes to Washington. Capra was born in Italy, but became an ardent patriot for his adopted country, and many of his films celebrate what he considered to be American values. (Mr Smith Goes to Washington is another example).The lasting popularity of It's a Wonderful Life can perhaps be attributed to its quiet celebration of small-town values, of basic decency, of friendship, of generosity, of idealism, of community spirit and of faith in a benevolent providence. Yet Capra is not afraid to criticise other cherished American values- the figure of Potter can be taken as a critique of untrammeled free-market capitalism- nor to face up to the darker side of life, to despair, to selfishness and to villainy. The false values of Pottersville may have been vanquished in Bedford Falls, but as audiences in 1946 would have been aware, those values still prevailed in many real-life communities. In the contest between good and evil, victory can never be taken for granted. 9\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"3 January 2013","score":"3 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Lexie Lubinskas High Noon ReviewNewlyweds Will Kane and Amy Fowler, played by Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly, find that they will have to put the post-wedding jitters on hold. Will, the former marshal of his town, was informed that the man he put in jail named Frank Miller was arriving on the noon train to seek revenge on him. Desperate for aid in the attack on Frank Miller and his men, Kane puts his badge back on, and seeks but fails to find help in his community.This classic American western movie gives a charming small town lure mixed with love and an intense suspense as Kane hastily searches for help. Also, sultry Latina Helen Ramirez, played by Katy Jurado, added a spicy contrast to extremely conservative Amy. The constant frantic vibe keeps the movie hypnotizing; making viewers captivated in the plot.'Another aspect of the movie that I found unique about this film was its timing. The movie, which is eighty seven minutes long, is real time to what is happening. There isn't any overlapping or events happening simultaneously, it's all chronological. I haven't seen a movie that has done this before, and it added a nice touch to the charm and uniqueness of the movie.Throughout the film, a delightful melody was played. A song titled Do Not Forsake Me, O' My Darling by Tex Ritter won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1952, and it's easy to see why. It truly is a catchy tune, and it fits well with the movie. It's slow with a southern twang hitched to it, which is similar to the feel of the movie. Whoever decided to add it did a remarkable job because it suits the film.Over all, I thought it was a sweet classic movie. However, I don't think I would ever want to watch it again.
