Almost from the start it's clear to see that Roland Emmerich burrows extensively from all godfathers of Alien encounter films that came before; from the way the Alien space craft arrives in the sky surrounded in a plume of stormy clouds like scenes from the remake of War of the Worlds, the very look of the Aliens themselves clearly draw comparisons with Ridley Scots 'Alien', then you have the possible extinction of the human race to deal with, similar to The Day the Earth Stood Still. Some may say this is a signal of lack of imagination and originality on writer Dean Devlin part, but the way I look at it, imitation is the sincerity form of flattery, and I see Independence Day as more of a allusion or a homage of the highest respects to those past greats, rather than a mere cheap carbon copy (Well costing at 75million and grossing over 800 million, more like a very expensive and successful carbon copy). Being a typical big budget Hollywood film the premise is as simple as ever, a massive fleet of alien space ships arrive on earth after travelling billions of light years, but there isn't a ET amongst them, these guys mean business! And they didn't come to earth for friendly game of stuck in the mud or a casual stroll in the park whilst sightseeing; instead they are came here to destroy it and everyone on it. But once again, with this being an American Hollywood feature, the only guys equipped to save the world is the president (Bill Pullman), a computer genius (Jeff Goldblum) and a highly skilled jet pilot (Will Smith). Queue the waving of the flag, handing out of American pie and an Elvis Presley greatest hits album. But there nothing wrong with a little bit of patriotism, but Bill Pullman gives the customary great American speech about unity and courage, and the rebranding of an American holiday into a global holiday, Independence Day does take patriotism to a palpable extreme, often venturing into the irritating and ridiculous as it makes every other country seem incapable of coping without out their help. But I digress, after the US army seems incapable of penetrating through the Aliens shield, with all their bullets and bombs, Jeff Goldblum being the computer genies that he is has the genius idea of simply disarming the shields &#x96; wow give the Einstein an Nobel Prize right? Well one problem, to administer the computer virus that will infect the mother ship that will in turn disarm all the other ship's shields for around two minutes, they have to get up close and personal to do so &#x96; queue loud mouth, charismatic Will smith. To say that Independence Day was high concept film would be a massive understatement; it would be the same as saying Beetles were just a rock band. But I feel films that get labelled as high concept always get such a bad rep. What's wrong with appealing to all four quadrants of the film market, isn't watching films supposed to be an inclusive, communal experience. A film can bring together different; races, religions, genders and ages, surely that something that should be celebrated and encompasses everything that makes cinema so magical. And watching Independence Day was truly a magical experience; you just have to look at the performances, well the performance of Will Smith, who stands heads and shoulder above everyone else, in a film that made him an eventual global superstar. Like I said, he was loud and charismatic, making his character so enticing and exciting to watch. I simply love the scene when the Alien crash lands and tries to get out of its ship, only to be punched in the face by Will Smith, Well come to earth which would probably go down as one of my all time favourite move scenes and quotes ever. His performance was almost as big and spectacular as the special effects even though they are from 1996, I feel they easily outdo some modern day big budget films such as the embarrassingly bad Olympus has Fallen.

Obviously Death Wish is his piece de resistance some would say (including me.) The ultimate revenge flick, dark, twisted, masterful, hard to watch...it is a classic exploitation flick. It is also the furthest thing from the type of flick that would normally be serialized it but they certainly did just that. It has been a long time since I made my way through the series so its time and so far I'm glad I did. The best compliment I can give Death Wish 2 is that it holds the same style, intrigue, violent gritty style and a story that is completely rehashed BUT never feels rehashed. It is the perfect epilogue and we actually want to know what happened to Paul Kersey and his vigilante crusade. As disturbing and violent as the first film was they manage to push the envelope with this one. The body count seems exponential and the battle is even harder for Kersey. These thugs actually fight back with guns and all. The film makers really make an effort to be shocking this time around with the gratuitous rape scene (much like the first film) and the bloody deaths but they don't do it in sacrifice of the story. The political aspect is there (in fact goes into even more depth this time around), you begin to understand and see Kersey's desire for vengeance but also how it has consumed it. An absolutely worthy action thriller that is realistically as good as the first.This role was just an absolutely perfect fit for legendary tough guy Charles Bronson. I constantly found myself amazed that he was in his sixties when he filmed this. Our ageing action stars get poked fun at now but he does not seem his age at all and is a realistic and perfectly acceptable action hero and holds his own against his attackers. Bronson is perfect as Kersey and no one else could have done it like he does. Jill Ireland is decent as Kersey's new love interest. She is pretty stiff and certainly isn't a stand out performance however she does seem comfortable and has good chemistry with Bronson so she fits the bill. One of the best things they could have done was bring back Vincent Gardenia as Frank Ochoa, the New York City Detective that pursued Kersey in the first film. I felt like their rivalry was left largely unexplored in the first film and they definitely brought it full circle in a truly perfect conclusion for the second film. The supporting cast are all good and fill their roles well including solid performances from JD Cannon, Ben Frank, Silvana Gallardo and Robin Sherwood.Director Michael Winner clearly had more story to tell and he did it well. Bringing in a new director would have been a completely different experience because Winner has a gritty, dark, exploitative style that he proved with Death Wish and other collaborations with Bronson. I can't imagine anyone coming out of Death Wish 2 not at least being pleased with the film. It is everything a sequel should be. They did everything right. They took everything that made Death Wish a stone cold vengeance classic and gave the fans everything they wanted and everything they needed in a sequel. It further the characters, develops the story further, gives us more of what we love from the first one. It is absolutely a worthy sequel that on its own merits is just okay but combined with the first is just as good.

The marketing was massive. Everywhere you looked there was the bat logo on something. Every other kid you saw (and many adults) had one of those cool black Batman shirts. Every time you turned on the TV there was a commercial for the movie. I can't think of anything else like it from my generation until maybe Jurassic Park and even that was different.It's a spectacular movie. Tim Burton crafted a darkly Gothic world with fantastic sets and special effects. The designs for the Batman suit, the Batmobile, etc. were unlike anything else that had been seen at the time. Yes, it was inspired by the darker tone the comic had taken a few years prior, but for the most part this is all Burton. It would be a hugely influential movie, reigniting interest in comic book and superhero properties. It would also lead to the excellent Batman animated series in the '90s, one of the best cartoon series ever. I have to chuckle at another reviewer saying this was too dark and violent to be marketed to kids like it was. I was a kid when I saw it and the only thing I remember disturbing me about it was Jerry Hall's face after the Joker disfigures her.Danny Elfman's score is so good he would mine it again and again for the next decade. The acting and directing are superb. Much is made of Michael Keaton being outshined by Jack Nicholson.

I'm watching the 2004 extended version, with all the delete scenes in it. Directed by Sergio Leone, this movie is the third film in the Dollars Trilogy following 1964's A Fistful of Dollars and 1965's For a Few Dollars More, serving as a prequel to them. Thank Goodness, the movie wasn't call 'The Two Magnificent Tramps', its working title. In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, River of Dollars, or The Man with No Name, but decided on The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The title, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly suite the plot so well. The plot revolves around three gunslingers, 'the Good' AKA 'Brodie' AKA 'The Man with no name (Clint Eastwood), 'The Bad' AKA 'Angel Eyes' (Lee Van Cleef) and 'The Ugly Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez (Eli Wallach). All three are competing to find a fortune in buried Confederate gold during the American Civil War. All the actors in this film are great. Clint Eastwood is great. I love that the producers finally explain where his character got his trademark poncho. Granted, the other two were morally worse than him, but Blondie's not exactly a nice guy, too. It's more like 'the good enough'. I love, how Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach work with each other. Lots of chemistry there, yet a lot of backstabbing triathlon with the trio. Tuco is the only one of the trio, the audience really gets to know all about. We meet his brother and find out where he came from and why he became a bandit. The other two are more of a mysteries. The names Blondie and Angel Eyes aren't exactly threatening, but workable. Blondie's hair is sandy brown. This is due to imperfect translation from the original Italian. Mad props to Eli Wallach for doing all the dangerous stunts as he almost got killed in real life like three times during the making of this movie. Eli Wallach pretty much steals the movie with his character. Originally, Leone wanted Charles Bronson to play Angel Eyes but he was already committed to another movie, and Leone choose Lee Van Cleef as the villain, playing opposite to the character, he plays in the 'For a Few Dollars More'. I glad, Lee Van Cleef was chosen for the film. He was best as the villain. Still, it does get kinda confusing, story wise seeing how the films are supposedly connect to each other. In the theatrical trailer, Angel Eyes is referred to as The Ugly and Tuco as The Bad. This is due to a translation error; the original Italian title translates literally to The Good, the Ugly, the Bad. Still, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly had tons of memorable lines, funny scenes, and epic action, but the movie is really long. It takes forever to get to the buried treasure part of the movie, even if you watching a way cut down version. Angel Eyes besides the opening, doesn't show up, until half way to the film. Lots of desert scenes that they add in the 2004 version was cut out for a good reason. The movie takes a lot of side steps missions like blowing a strategic bridge, bounty hunters, and money-schemes that were entertaining, but kinda distracting as the gold plot takes a backseat, most of the first act and second. The movie has a great sweeping widescreen cinematography by Director of photography Tonino Delli Colli. The Cemetery showdown is intense. I love how the movie is shot with all the dramatic extreme close ups to give the audience, a sense of tensed. The movie got tense, due to falling out between Leone and Clint Eastwood, as Eastwood got tired of all the camera shooting in different angles, sweeping long shots, and extreme close ups. Both never work together again, after this. I can see why Eastwood might had got upset. There is a bit too much artsy in the film, but it's not too bad. Many of Leone's trademarks, hugely influential to modern filmmakers. Unlike A Fistful of Dollars nor For a Few Dollars More, this film had a bigger budget and its shows. Mad props to the people had to build the bridge in the blowing up scene, it had to be filmed and build twice due to the camera being destroy in the first shot. Another to the crew building a cemetery, just for the Sad Hill shootout scene. The money was well-used. I love the Civil War theme. The theme shows how brutal the backdrop, the Civil War was during that time and how absurd it was. The dubbing on my version was really good. Love the Curse Cut Beep. Ennio Morricone composed the soundtrack. The main theme is turned into one for each protagonist The Good's has a whistle, The Bad's an ocarina, and The Ugly's screamed. It works so well. 'Story of a soldier' is beautiful. It's eerily in a way, since it play during the torture scene. I also love the score, Ecstasy of Gold. It's haunting at the beginning, it draws you in, slowly. Then it smacks you in the face like a ton of bricks and voila! Depending on what version, you're watching this movie. It can take from 161 min to 186 min. The 186 minute is dubbed. If you find the 2002 extended, it's in English, but cut to 179 min. Then you have an old copy, like the 1984's version, its 142, but its cut as hell. In my opinion, just get the 2004 DVD. Tons of special features on the behind the scene production, documentaries, and additional footages like too badly damaged film negative. All of them are worth the price of 2004 DVD. Overall One of the best cinematic film. Worth watching if haven't yet saw.

Then Lucas, who has set us up (Hey, Greg, look at my thumb!) for a disaster we can't see coming, slaps us across the face with death and destruction. But Animal House isn't meant to be as much of a memoir tinged with sadness as a look at the knuckleheads your grandparents went to college with--and what they were capable of.

It seemed a good movie when it came out, and it won awards. Sam Mendes directing, Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Daniel Craig, Jude Law; how can it be so slight? How come it seemed good on a first viewing? A simplistic story, without depth or character development, and no sympathy or emotion. Affected self conscious direction steals away compassion or interest. An example; we are given a room full of people reading newspapers. EVERYONE is reading a newspaper, and virtually every newspaper is held open at a double page spread. Nobody wanted to read a book? Nobody folded a newspaper to get a close focus, as you do? It made a great pattern, and was a perfect example of style over content. A snow covered urban scene, and then a great downpour of rain. Photogenic stuff, rain; misty, and especially attractive on a dark night. Dripping off hat brims! Yeah, that looks good, so let's do it again. But torrential downpours like this would have cleared snow away. Next morning what do we get? Snow, mature snow that's been there for days, looking exactly as it did before the rain on the ground. It made no sense, and I grant you it is not a vital detail, but detail it is. Good direction involves more than good shots. And the acting was subsumed by such directorial conceits. Even Paul Newman could not make sense of his Irish American accent. Was this - could it be? - Sam Mendes? Mendes, so good when he does Shakespeare in the theatre, and outstanding when running his production company, Neal Street? It seems he does not direct good films. His first film was - I think - the Oscar winning 'American Beauty', which was disappointingly predictable. So was Revolutionary Road, which again lacked any convincing relationship. Maybe he will make a good film one day, but he has to get over this mannered stuff, which only works with James Bond, where depth and insight are not needed. When he is in a producer role, as in the brilliant 'Hollow Crown', Neal Street's conflation of four great Shakespeare history plays, he steers the films to excellence. Having Richard Eyre and Rupert Goold on hand to direct gets fine results.And a fantastic script helps, of course.

It seemed a good movie when it came out, and it won awards. Sam Mendes directing, Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Daniel Craig, Jude Law; how can it be so slight? How come it seemed good on a first viewing? A simplistic story, without depth or character development, and no sympathy or emotion. Affected self conscious direction steals away compassion or interest. An example; we are given a room full of people reading newspapers. EVERYONE is reading a newspaper, and virtually every newspaper is held open at a double page spread. Nobody wanted to read a book? Nobody folded a newspaper to get a close focus, as you do? It made a great pattern, and was a perfect example of style over content. A snow covered urban scene, and then a great downpour of rain. Photogenic stuff, rain; misty, and especially attractive on a dark night. Dripping off hat brims! Yeah, that looks good, so let's do it again.

At the same time, a big part of why that may be so is that The Big Heat is in many ways hardly a film noir at all. All of the great canonical film noirs, including Otto Preminger's Laura, Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity and Ace in the Hole, Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past, and Alexander Mackendrick's The Sweet Smell of Success, tend to be populated by characters with little trace of goodness left in them; they are all doomed, fated to their inevitably bitter ends from the outset. What makes The Big Heat so powerful and disturbing&#x97;and, ultimately, so unlike most film noirs&#x97;is that it has, at its heart, many genuinely good people.Fritz Lang, the brilliant German director who had already cemented his place in cinematic history with monumental films like Metropolis, Dr. Mabuse The Gambler, and M, creates in The Big Heat a film whose strength lies in defying expectations of plot, genre, and characterization. Its opening, for instance, is not a far cry from the usual hard-boiled detective formula. Police Sergeant Bannion (Glenn Ford) is assigned to investigate the suicide of a high-ranking fellow officer, which leads him to uncover a trail of corruption and licentiousness and, in turn, puts him into deep trouble with the local mob syndicate, headed by Mike Legana (Alex Scourby) and the psychopathic Vince Stone (a young Lee Marvin).Lang manages to transcend these cut-and-dry foundations, however, by affording his protagonist a greater depth than one usually finds in a hard-boiled detective hero. The typical hard-boiled detective is unshakeable, wisecracking and ethically-ambiguous, but generally one-note coolness is all they have going for them. Glenn Ford's character, by contrast, is a family man and, ultimately, a tragic figure. Whereas the characters in other film noirs are often so uniformly reprehensible that any misfortunes that befall them seem almost warranted, the juxtaposition between Bannion's tough policeman persona and his fatherly sensitivity and protectiveness&#x97;first with his daughter and later with Stone's abused girlfriend Debbie (Gloria Grahame)&#x97;makes the character's plights and perils all the more involving. You see, Bannion is not just a smart-talking male power fantasy, but a decent, honest man who is merely driven to brutality by tragic circumstances.Perhaps the reason that The Big Heat seems so sadistically violent, then, is that the audience is given genuine reason to sympathize with those who are subjected to it. Again, this is where Lang's genius really comes into play. Anyone who has seen enough Hollywood movies would naturally expect that after Bannion carries his unconscious wife (played by Marlon Brando's older sister, Jocelyn Brando) off-screen after she has been wounded in a car-bombing intended for him, there would be a scene in which we see her safely recovering in a hospital bed and Bannion angrily promising her that he will find out who was responsible for the attack. But no in the next scene, we find out that she dies. On top of that, Lang mercilessly obliterates the quaint, idyllic domesticity of the Bannion household in earlier scenes with a scene in which Bannion bitterly packs up and moves out of the old family home, now cold and empty. It's truly heartbreaking, and it makes Bannion's subsequent trials all the more compelling and, dare I say, poignant. The same goes for the infamous scene in which Lee Marvin scalds Gloria Grahame's face with a pot of boiling coffee. The scene is especially cringe-inducing and sadistic because the audience realizes that she is not just some vain, self-obsessed gangster moll (which, in a more conventional film noir, would make the cruel attack seem like poetic justice), but merely an unlucky, good-natured girl who got caught up with the wrong kind of guys.The rest of The Big Heat then works like the best of revenge tragedies, in which even more cruelty and violent retribution is enacted as form of catharsis. The one thing that struck me the most about the action in this film is just how much more forceful and yet satisfying it seemed. Just like any hard-boiled hero, Bannion goes around and punches the lights out of a lot of henchmen throughout the film. Under Lang's direction, though, the punching in The Big Heat doesn't have the stagey and almost slapstick-like physics of other cinematic punches, with the bad guys awkwardly stumbling backwards or flipping over tables. Instead, when Bannion punches somebody, they practically fly across the room, knocking everything down in their path. That Lang often quick-cuts or whips the camera around in tandem with the physical blows gives an even greater illusion of weight to the action. Furthermore, not only does Bannion punch a lot of people, but he strangles quite a few people too, including one of the female antagonists. It is here that I must give due credit to Glenn Ford for his performance here he is not just good; he's scary good. Again, the fact that Ford is capable of showing Bannion as both a loving family man and a ruthless enforcer makes things all the more chilling.It's almost unbelievable that a film as relentless, audacious, and absorbing as Lang's The Big Heat could have been made in the context of the Hollywood studio system under the notoriously restrictive Production Code. Then again, like many of the best films from this era, maybe it's precisely *because* of the constraints of the period that the film is so effective denied the ability to portray realistic violence or sexual content&#x97;the kind that is all but commonplace in today's films&#x97;, a filmmaker like Lang would have had to rely on the subtle power of suggestion and of well-honed characterization to generate emotional impact. That Lang was still able to make it all work so astoundingly well is surely a testament to both his and the film's undeniable greatness.

The scene is so well choreographed and performed by Chaplin that it proves what a genius he truly was. It's been more than 80 years since the film was released and it still remains as one of the best romantic comedies ever made. City Lights has a lot of heart, several funny moments, and a perfectly executed final scene that will touch even the hardest hearts. I've seen many famous scenes from Chaplin's work, but this is the first time I sat through a full movie of his. It was a unique and joyous experience despite the fact that I'm not the biggest fan of pantomime and some of the gags run a bit too long. Chaplin was not only a great actor, but he also was an excellent director, writer, and composer. The film is well edited and the technical achievements are surprisingly good. In the midst of the talkie revolution Chaplin decided to remain silent despite adding some amusing sound effects and he proved that powerful stories could be told without dialogue. It's a work of pure genius and a film that all film lovers should experience on their own. City Lights has encouraged me to begin a Chaplin marathon during this week and I think it's going to be a lot of fun to get to know one of cinema's most beloved characters the tramp.Charles Chaplin plays the Little Tramp once again in City Lights and this time he meets a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) with whom he falls in love. Without her knowing it, he follows her to her home and discovers she is in financial troubles, so being the selfless little tramp he is he decides to try to help her out. Despite not having any money, the tramp tries to find ways to help her out while she mistakenly believes he is a millionaire. The tramp begins looking for work and even enters a boxing ring in order to make some money to help the girl pay for an operation that will restore her sight back, but he is unsuccessful in most of his endeavors. While searching for a place to rest one night near the city's river he accidentally runs into a millionaire (Harry Myers) who is about to commit suicide. The tramp saves his life and the two get drunk together and become friends. The only problem is that when the millionaire is sober he forgets about his friend so their relationship is on and off depending on the amount of alcohol he has had.City Lights has a simple premise, but the way Chaplin tells the story is very captivating and heart warming. His physical performance is among the best I've seen and his facial expressions are priceless. There is also an underlying message behind his funny and touching tale and the tramp represents the best side of humanity. The themes of selflessness, kindness, and classism still resonate in our society today. If you weren't won over by the story in general I am sure the ending will touch everyone and the hilarious boxing scene will tickle even the most grumpy hearts. City Lights is a film full of grace and you don't see movies like these made any more. During a troubled time after the Great Depression, Chaplin managed to maintain a sense of humor and bring joy and laughter to an era that was very much in need of it. ","genre":null},{"date":"22 April 2014","score":"","review":" Tomorrow the birds will sing.Before Raging Bull or Rocky, Charles Chaplin brought us one of the most memorable boxing scenes in film history. The scene is so well choreographed and performed by Chaplin that it proves what a genius he truly was. It's been more than 80 years since the film was released and it still remains as one of the best romantic comedies ever made. City Lights has a lot of heart, several funny moments, and a perfectly executed final scene that will touch even the hardest hearts. I've seen many famous scenes from Chaplin's work, but this is the first time I sat through a full movie of his. It was a unique and joyous experience despite the fact that I'm not the biggest fan of pantomime and some of the gags run a bit too long. Chaplin was not only a great actor, but he also was an excellent director, writer, and composer. The film is well edited and the technical achievements are surprisingly good. In the midst of the talkie revolution Chaplin decided to remain silent despite adding some amusing sound effects and he proved that powerful stories could be told without dialogue. It's a work of pure genius and a film that all film lovers should experience on their own. City Lights has encouraged me to begin a Chaplin marathon during this week and I think it's going to be a lot of fun to get to know one of cinema's most beloved characters the tramp.Charles Chaplin plays the Little Tramp once again in City Lights and this time he meets a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) with whom he falls in love. Without her knowing it, he follows her to her home and discovers she is in financial troubles, so being the selfless little tramp he is he decides to try to help her out. Despite not having any money, the tramp tries to find ways to help her out while she mistakenly believes he is a millionaire. The tramp begins looking for work and even enters a boxing ring in order to make some money to help the girl pay for an operation that will restore her sight back, but he is unsuccessful in most of his endeavors. While searching for a place to rest one night near the city's river he accidentally runs into a millionaire (Harry Myers) who is about to commit suicide.

This film is about as authentic as you'll get when it comes to Hollywood and real life. I just felt like I was involved in this movie as if it was my life. The dialog is so real and believable. This indie film is funny and heartfelt as it is about bromances and these men finding their way in life.Doug Liman's film is about two friends named Trent and Mike who like to party it up in Hollywood. Mike is a wannabe actor who is coming off a six-year relationship and Trent is his friend who wants him to move on and succeed in life.This is the film that made Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn household names. I never seen Favreau as that big superstar, but he has the ability as evident by this film. He certainly is capable of an actor as he is a director. Vince Vaughn is funny and very talkative. His catchphrase involving the use of money as an adjective deserves some props even if it does get annoying after awhile.Overall, Swingers is a great comedy that has great themes of young people trying to find their way in life. It's very authentic thanks to a realistic screenplay. There are many laugh-out-loud moments and one that will hold true to your heart. For the kind of film it is, I couldn't help but love it. I rate this film 9\/10.
