But it works! Director David Fincher did a masterful job of taking a well written, but very far fetched, story and knitted it together with great performances by Michael Douglas (spectacular), Deborah Kara Unger, Sean Penn, and brilliant atmospherics that make this a stomach twister from beginning to end, and end, and end, (there are three). When viewing a film like this you have to ask or answer only one question. Does it suspend your disbelief long enough for you to go along with what you're seeing and have the required emotional response for the story to move forward? The answer here is, YES. If not for Michael Douglas and Deborah Kara Unger this could not have worked. Douglas, as Nicholas Van Orten, brings the audience along with him on a terrifying journey, The Game, from his perch high above the financial world to his complete ruin, destitution, and eventual suicide. It is a wild and scary ride and at least once I jumped right out of my seat. Deborah Kara Unger, as Kristine, had an equally challenging job and I loved how she did it. She is the chameleon in the story. She deftly blends into whatever phase the story is at and you're never quite sure if she's a killer, a thief, the mastermind, or your best friend. How she does this is amazing to watch. A simple turn of her head can send a chill up your spine and you suddenly know (or think you know) she's not who you thought she was. When Van Orten confronts her with her fake first communion picture she's toast. Or so you think. Without missing a beat she walks right up to him and whispers, they're watching. It's chilling. I love performances that are quiet and mysterious and hers is as good as they come. The original music by Howard Shore is brilliant. The score, as far as I can tell, uses only a few strings, piano, and a very haunting French Horn. So simple, but so effective. Other popular songs dot the movie and that's where my only complaint of this film comes in. I love the song White Rabbit by Jefferson Airplane. And it's used to great affect in this film to scare the crap out of you. And so from now on when I hear it I'll think about getting the crap scared out of me. Thanks. This really could have been a disaster. It's very well written but without Fincher's direction and a brilliant cast all bringing their A game it would never have worked. The holes in the plot, well itemized here at this site, are many. But it is still suspenseful and frightening and believable long enough for you to be taken in completely. The ending is baseball bat to the head. It works so well though I didn't hate myself at all for falling for it. Twice.

As a die-hard fan of the 90s show as well as Batman in general, I had to check this one out. And this film delivered way beyond my expectations. Even though many will brush it aside due to it being an animated film, this movie has enough atmosphere and depth to match up to its live-action counterparts. The animation itself is just as incredible as the TV series', obviously seeing as it is was made by the same cast and crew for the most part. The artwork is still the gorgeously dark color pallet used for the show, and to extremely good effect. The score by Shirley Walker still uses the good old Danny Elfman theme as its base but she goes in a lot of directions with it. Every second of the music is just ominous, heroic and ultimately awesome.The voice acting is pure bad-ass, with the always appreciated Kevin Conroy as the Dark Knight, and Mark Hamill as the demented Joker.Both do superbly. Also, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. is great as Alfred and Dana Delany, who would go on to voice Lois Lane in the Superman TV series also headed by Bruce W. Timm, does excellently as well. The story offers plenty of great dialogue, speaking of which, it's simply put one of the most outstanding pieces of writing I've seen in the animation genre. The story being told is dark, involving and gives the characters greatly needed depth. It moves briskly, but never fails to build tension until it finally answers the question of just who is behind the grisly murders. Along the way, you will see Bruce Wayne's trail to become the Caped Crusader in one of the best tellings of this particular tale. Few of the live action Batman films have touched upon the hero's origin's as so in this film. All of the characters are very interesting, and all are intertwined beautifully. Hamill will always be the Joker to me. The best line in the entire movie, to me anyways for purely sentimental reasons, would be when Joker viciously says Don't touch me, old man!, but then almost light heartedly and comically adds I don't know where you've been. It's just great to see.So, in the end, the movie has great artwork, solid characterization, a very intriguing mystery storyline all backed by a thundering and magnificent score. I won't spoil the conclusion of it all, because I'm sure there are plenty of others out there who have yet to experience this great movie.

Okay, he may never get anything better than the daft entertainment of Deep Rising but he always seems to pick projects that have at least some fun factor in them.And so it remains the case with Dead Heat, a movie that takes the buddy-cop flick and mixes in some zombie action, resulting in an amusing, bullet-riddled romp with a few people battling decay just as much as battling criminals.Treat Williams is Detective Roger Mortis (see what they did there? See?) and Joe Piscopo plays his partner, Detective Doug Bigelow. The two are mavericks who leave destruction and massive repair bills in their wake but who also get results. The biggest puzzle, however, is a series of recent crimes featuring criminals who seem a lot harder to kill than your usual flesh and blood baddies. What's going on? Can our two detectives find out before they end up in body bags themselves?Dead Heat is lacking in a lot of ways but in oh so many other ways it's just completely awesome, which is why I even things out to rate the thing at 7\/10. Treat Williams is good, though he's no De Niro, and he looks better in every scene that he shares with Joe Piscopo (a man so unfunny that hyenas turn mute whenever he's nearby), but the real treat for horror fans is the limited screen time given to the great Vincent Price. Robert Picardo has a small role too and Darren McGavin has a lot of fun with his character. Lindsay Frost and Clare Kirkconnell play two women caught up in events and do well enough with what they have to work with.Mark Goldblatt's direction is okay and Terry (brother of Shane) Black's script is so-so when not having to give dialogue to Piscopo but this is one of those movies that overcomes the different pieces to become so much better as one whole experience. Because Dead Heat is about crazy shoot outs between people who can't be easily killed, it's about a sequence of sustained insanity in a Chinese butcher shop that has to be seen to be believed and it's about a finale full of so much fun that it makes up for every witticism that we've had to endure from Piscopo.I have to also say how impressed I was by the movie's attitude towards it's characters, nobody is too safe and deaths are quite sudden and without any fanfare. It's very 80s and it's never going to be the leader of the pack in any subgenre it can be classed in but it's also a hugely entertaining riot and one that I've finally seen after 20+ years of wanting to get my hands on it without ending up hugely disappointed.

Treat Williams is good, though he's no De Niro, and he looks better in every scene that he shares with Joe Piscopo (a man so unfunny that hyenas turn mute whenever he's nearby), but the real treat for horror fans is the limited screen time given to the great Vincent Price. Robert Picardo has a small role too and Darren McGavin has a lot of fun with his character. Lindsay Frost and Clare Kirkconnell play two women caught up in events and do well enough with what they have to work with.Mark Goldblatt's direction is okay and Terry (brother of Shane) Black's script is so-so when not having to give dialogue to Piscopo but this is one of those movies that overcomes the different pieces to become so much better as one whole experience. Because Dead Heat is about crazy shoot outs between people who can't be easily killed, it's about a sequence of sustained insanity in a Chinese butcher shop that has to be seen to be believed and it's about a finale full of so much fun that it makes up for every witticism that we've had to endure from Piscopo.I have to also say how impressed I was by the movie's attitude towards it's characters, nobody is too safe and deaths are quite sudden and without any fanfare. It's very 80s and it's never going to be the leader of the pack in any subgenre it can be classed in but it's also a hugely entertaining riot and one that I've finally seen after 20+ years of wanting to get my hands on it without ending up hugely disappointed.

The similarities are certainly there Martin Landau's subplot, of a husband having to dispose of a troublesome mistress, is in 'Match Point' expanded to feature-length, and stripped of Allen's comedy relief. Also present in both films is the sense that Woody Allen is upending genre conventions, via last-minute plot turns that actively avoid the narrative closure to which audiences have become accustomed. In this film, Judah Rosenthal (Landau) agonises at length over his sins, which are great, before departing the film with family and reputation intact. There's even the suggestion that he'll eventually overcome his guilt and learn to live with it. Meanwhile, small-time filmmaker Cliff Stern (Allen) covets a woman who isn't his wife (a moral misdemeanour at worst), and loses everything he cares about. It's a heartbreaking ending for a character whose story, until then, had been relatively lightweight.Religion lies at the forefront of the film. We know this because rain disrupted Allen's shooting schedule, to which the director is said to have remarked, Maybe it's too realistic, or it's too atheistic - and probably it turns out there is a God, who doesn't want this picture made. I did get the sense of atheism. In movies, there IS an omniscient being who observes everything and demands moral closure; that is, the viewer. In real life, Allen posits, there is no such guiding force, and crime doesn't always get punished. While I did appreciate this style of cinematic revisionism, I think I prefer the blunter 'Match Point,' in which the noirish crime story was the main attraction. You can't really fault anyone's efforts here, though. Allen, Landau, and Alan Alda &#x96; as an amusingly egotistical television producer &#x96; are all excellent, the jazz and classical soundtrack is a lot of fun, and the photography of Sven Nykvist (favourite of Ingmar Bergman) is nicely low-key and subdued.

In his earlier works, like SISTERS and OBSESSION, De Palma borrows to the point of nearly remaking some of Hitchcock's techniques and sequences; OBSESSION itself was a near-remake of the masterpiece VERTIGO. But if imitation is really the sincerest form of flattery, then this man and his movies are the finest example. As a Hitchcock fan (he's my favorite director), I must say I have grown a fondness for De Palma's works; that his movies almost reminds me too much of Hitch's own works is actually a plus. His 1980 slasher thriller DRESSED TO KILL took some heavy criticism upon release, aimed mostly at the fact that the film borrows from Hitch's masterpiece PSYCHO or that the movie's gory sequences seem to suggest violence toward women. But time has been kind to DRESSED TO KILL, and finally it is seen as the underrated masterpiece that it is.Giving too much of the story away would be criminal, but just to give you the heads up, the story follows sexually-frustrated housewife Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson), who's married life is loosing its passion. During the opening sequence, we see her fantasizing about being raped in the shower while having a passionless wham-bang lovemaking with her husband. When its over, he pats her on the cheek as if to tell her she did a good job, leaving Kate wanting. Questioning her own sexual worth, she regularly sees her shrink Dr. Robert Elliot (Michael Caine). But the good doctor has problems of his own. A patient of his named Bobbi is on a murderous rampage using the doctor's own razor as the weapon of choice. Nancy Allen is back playing another hooker, but this time as one of those heart of gold types, named Liz Blake. In bit performances, Kieth Gordon plays Miller's nerdy but courageous son and Dennis Franz in one of those cop roles as the cantankerous Det.

And with regards to De Palma, he has used PSYCHO as the ground work for his skills at visual storytelling and mise-en-scene. Combine De Palma's superb skill at setting up shots and orchestrating set pieces, excellent cinematography by Ralf Bode (though frequent collaborator Vilmos Zsigmond would have done just as adequate a job), and a memorable score by Pino Donaggio (here at his finest; a score that Hitch himself would have been proud of) and the result, among other brilliant sequences, is the film's classic museum scene, a beautifully shot and mysterious sequence that might have been something out of VERTIGO and may not be too much a big deal to the story itself, but its pure cinema at its finest. It's just...amazing! There a number of set pieces that are just as outstanding, including the gruesome elevator scene that recalls the classic PSYCHO shower scene, but is a classic scene all its own.Beautiful set-pieces, a haunting score, some fine acting, some biting moments of black humor (the PSYCHO-inspired psychological-babble is followed by a hilarious send-up of it) and sarcastic satire (the scene set in the subway, where a couple of black thugs harass Allen's character, are a clear critique on the racism of the day) and above all a talented director at its helm.

In this film Kubrick shows the horrors and dehumanizing that war can do to someone. Technically there is two parts of the film, Boot Camp and The War and I will be reviewing the two of them separately. Boot Camp What can I say about Boot Camp its pure genius. Stellar direction and lots of witty and dark humor makes this pure Kubrick, just a damn fun time, though as I did like the direction to me it just isn't as artsy like many of his other films like 2001 A Space Odyssey or the Shinning but never the less I still liked it. There's three main characters here, Private Joker played by Matthew Modine, Leonard\/Private Pyle played by Vincent D'Onofrio and the best of them all Sgt. Hartman played by Lee Ermey. Lee Ermey is fantastic as the Sgt. Hartman. Do you feel dizzy? Do you feel faint! Jesus H. Christ! I think you've got a hard-on! He gives a performance that steals the entire movie. He was actually a Sgt in real life, which explains this. He and Private Pyle are the best part of the film, I just found them to be the most memorable out of all the characters and that they give their best performances in my opinion. Though Hartman is a fantastic (might I mention one of the most memorable and favorite character of all time) of a drill instructor, I might like Private Pyle's performance a little more mostly because of the deep character development. From being this nice normal guy to transforming himself into this killing machine that shows the dehumanization of war. Brilliant character development and I am a sucker for deep character development. The War Sadly the second part of Full Metal Jacket isn't as good as it was at Boot camp. The movie still has some dark humor and shows more of the horrors of war but it starts slipping into some war clichés and at some points started to get boring. Private Joker has more of a part here but without spoiling anything without Hartman or Pyle here it just wasn't as enjoyable. But what almost made up for this was the sniper scene which I just found out that The Hurt Locker kind of copied off of it. This is probably the best part of The War, One of their guys in the troop is shot down by a sniper and they need to rescue him. They don't know where the sniper is, some of them say they have to move on others want to rescue him and take the sniper down. I liked all the characters each of them showing there own style of their take on war, it created deep suspense then, the movie already showed how war can dehumanize someone and that you can die at any time in war so I didn't know what character would choose to do next.

Plus with the brilliance of Boot Camp Full Metal Jacket may not be Kubrick's best (or like I said artsy) film but I still had a damn fun time with it. This is a war movie that everyone should watch.

Yes - you can visit the house (National Trust for Australia) just off the road between Sydney and Katoomba in the Blue Mountains National Park. We visited several times and always loved it.

Sure - its themes are pretty obvious; sexual suppression and awakening, libertarian\/counter-cultural views. Other reviewers have disliked the nude\/moral\/anti-Christian elements of the film - but I can't agree with them. Sirens is about exploding the myths of the female body and the taboos associated with female sexuality and female self-awareness and it does this in a way which to my mind doesn't offend or depart from the reality of the human experience. You can enjoy Sirens for allowing the exploration of these issues from the peace and tranquillity of your living room chair. Some reviewers have seen deeper themes. If there is anything more it's to do with feminine sisterhood, bonding and peer identity. But I'm not sure - it would depend on the viewers life experience. Watch Sirens - decide for yourself.The light-hearted way of the movie is upheld throughout by the excellent music, great use of the magnificent Blue Mountains scenery, the easy dialogue and simple plot.The silly parts concern the treatment of the Australian locals, eg, the old drunk who only says get f*****d, the leering children and scenes in the rugged bar - where the locals show their contempt for the Lindsay crowd whom they mistrust and don't understand. This is handled in a way which makes country Australians in the 1930's look stupid and ignorant to the point of complete separation from any of the moral considerations of Lindsays artistic world as seen here.

One of my favorite actors ever, Willem Dafoe steps up and delivers a spectacular performance for a very original and genuinely well written character. Sure you could despise the film with all your heart for the fact that Dafoe is playing a homosexual, but that'd make you two things (1) a very close-minded conservative and (2) a person who has no desire for originality and genuine character design in films. Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus have a natural chemistry that made it seem they were actually brothers. and were just plain bad ass through out. Billy Connolly is awesome in it as well. He has a majestic and menacing presence through out as Il Duce. And David Della Rocco was just great, playing 'himself' as Duffy would have it. He was just another well played and interesting character, one to truly remember in film history.Aside all the great characters, the movie has a very involving storyline and atmosphere. It's a very graphic, violent and intense one, yet along with it all is some very well placed dark humor. It all just feels so natural you'll be laughing constantly and embracing these characters. By the end of the film, I guarantee you'll be tempted to quote them. And to top it all off, the premise in itself is a statement.

He does take up the issues presented in 8 1\/2 fans' demands, critics' demands, life's demands. But Sandy Bates (the main character, played by Woody Allen) is sympathetic, unlike the oppressively narcissistic Guido. I think that's because Allen peeks through all his characters and, despite all Mr. Allen's faults, he remains a sympathetic person. Charlotte Rampling plays Dorrie, Bates's muse, and Jessica Harper and Marie-Christine Barrault play love interests of Bates. Allen and cinematographer Gordon Willis do particularly well by Ms. Rampling. Hidden away in small parts are Laraine Newman, Louise Lasser, Daniel Stern, Brent Spiner, Sharon Stone, Judith Crist, and various executives in Allen's life. According to IMDb, Lasser and Allen were divorced when the movie was made, and the character of Dorrie is based on Louise Lasser. (Yikes. Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman was a documentary!)There are other Woody Allen movies that I like better, and if you watch this, I'd recommend watching 8 1\/2 just before Stardust Memories. Some of the references Allen makes are obvious, and some are subtle (Dorrie being his mother in a beach scene, for example). The movie is definitely a fantasy, with the theme of the movie being presented in a non-linear fashion. Woody Allen has said that the 'reality' ends when Bates is looking at the dead rabbit in his kitchen. Up until then, the movie is what is really going on in Bates's life; after the camera shows the dead rabbit, the rest of the movie is Bates's reverie on what's going on in his life -- it is not really happening. I missed this totally the first time I saw Stardust Memories, and having read Allen's comment about this, the meanings of the scenes we see change. I consider 8 1\/2 to be a much more visual movie. Much of what goes on in Woody Allen's movies is interior monologues that he brings to the surface as speeches, most of them neurotic. Fellini draws a clearer demarcation on what are Guido's fantasies and memories than Allen does, and Fellini _shows_ us more of what is going on in Guido's mind than Allen, who has Sandy _tell_ us. It's interesting to contrast the similar scenes in the two movies and see Allen's use of dialogue vis-a-vis Fellini's use of image. I'm contemplating whether Stardust Memories or 8 1\/2 was the better movie. I couldn't stand Guido, hence didn't like Fellini. Bates is a nebbishy neurotic, but he came across as more likable that then insufferably narcissistic Guido. However, 8 1\/2 has more style, is more visual than Mr. Allen's prolonged monologue that is Stardust Memories. Guido's flashbacks and reveries are more revealing than Bates's. In the end, I understand why Guido is the way he is, even though I don't like him. Woody Allen can't figure himself out, so he has no clues to offer his viewers. At the end of this movie (and of all Allen movies), Bates (Allen) remains as he is, a clumsy, neurotic, clueless man.Mr. Allen might be happier to know that I prefer his more serious work to his comedies.

It entails both religious themes, as well natural psychological focus in order to evoke reaction from viewers, making it a truly horrific display of demonic forces. Linda Blair, only a 12 year old actress plays dual roles, playing the innocent and soon to be the vessel of the very demon who she becomes. He claims to be the devil, when all he proves in the eyes of the doubtful Father Karras (Miller) that he is in fact a demon. To shine over the light of confusion on viewers, the Demons name is Pazuzu. This all becomes clear in the very odd, but still silently suspenseful introduction, as Father Merrin's discovery of certain artifacts points into the direction of that very monsters arrival. The discovery of a few small little statues resembling the beast, thus leading him to the very statue resembling Pazuzu. He probably knew it, but could not act enough to find him. His only option seemed to be to rely on the patience of waiting, hoping that in time he'd once again face this demon. In the time it took for the Exorcist to prepare, the demon preyed well, poisoning the mind as well as the very actions of his latest victim, Regan MacNeil. Regan, a sweet 12 year old, with little possibility of any evil lurking with in, has astonished her mother Chris (Burstyn), time and time again in the wake of this new persona. The awkward silence, blasphemes towards others, and the powerfully vibrating bed all pointing to various medical explanations. Doctors call it a lesion, a Psychiatrist will call it a spilt personality, others will simply call it an overreaction to her depression towards her absent father. A very desperate mother seeks answer after answer, only to feel more doubt, and less hope as she finds failure in every option given to her. In desperation and own reluctance towards locking her child up, Chris turns to exorcism, begging for the help of Father Karras, a priest\/shrink who's own faith has been going down the drain slowly in the wake of his own losses. At first the Father doubts this persona to be demonic, only to learn more of this monsters true clarification as he witnesses the supernatural aspects of Regan's tormentor. Green vomit, a chilling room brought on by the demon's very presence, and a talent of various languages. The film's title character the Exorcist arrives upon the wake of his presence, giving believers and non believers out there a showdown worth shouting, Holy Mother of God. Father Merrin, having experience in this very ritual, as well as being personally known by the demon, lashes every religious weapon lethal to the creature. A combination of holy water and uninterrupted prayers drive the demon to feeling excruciating pain, giving the hope that the very power of Christ can compel this so called devil, and save this servant of God. Alas that is not our end, because everything in life comes with sacrifices surprising both the good and the bad. Regan's life is spared, but at the cost of a sickly old man, and priest who's faith is further restored as he takes her curse, only to end it all in his own suicide, dying with both dignity and with the hope of forgiveness for his own trespasses. The Exorcist can be called many things, inspiring, horrifying, disgusting, disrespectful, and even maybe contradicting, however what makes it genuine is the very authenticity of its characters. As well as the haunting tone of it's direction, particularly in it's lead character Chris, as the mother of a girl who has become all but a complete stranger in her eyes, as she witnesses the demonic possession of her young child. I have to say though, by the performance of Linda Blair, I was both shocked and impressed at how she could just revert from the very innocence and charm that defines Regan, and then reverting to the very impure persona that defines the Satan wannabe demon. What makes the movie itself different from most horror flicks is, that it focuses it's inspiration of horror on the religious elements of God and demonic possession. It isn't afraid to show viewers just how impure the demon towards challenging the idea of God and his eternal love for us all, thus having the conclusion serve as both an inspiration of Gods own mysteriously sacred will towards the forces of evil. This film can also be considered a test for it's viewers in the lessons of comparing the concepts of actual demonic possession, and medically explainable psychiatry, giving us the chance to not only tell them apart with our own instincts, but with also our own belief in the forces outside science.

That couldn't be further from the truth. This is my second favorite in the entire franchise next to the original film. Vegas Vacation was watched by me countless times in the late nineties when I was very young, and really didn't know what the characters were discussing, or even saying for that matter. Along with Fools Rush In, this was my favorite film in my childhood.I recently ran into the National Lampoon's Vacation Collection on Amazon for about $25. What the hell? I'll pay that. I had already watched the first two, and really wanted to dive into the third and rewatch this (keep in mind, at the time, it had been around nine years since I had seen the film). I recently ran into it on Comedy Central, and there was the question again; what the hell? The Griswold Family returns to the screen, this time taking a family vacation to Las Vegas. While it isn't much of a family-friendly place, Clark (Chase) and Rusty (Embry) are more than happy to head there and have a damn good time. They even stop at Cousin Eddie's house (Quaid) for more fun, but soon enough, they wind up taking him to Vegas unexpectedly. Let the crazy, nonstop, unrealistic, comedy antics begin. Clark gambles away their money, the wife Ellen (D'Angelo) falls in love with Wayne Newton, Rusty gets a fake ID and wins big, and Audrey (played by the stunning and gorgeous Marisol Nichols) loosens up to become a dancer.It's nothing special, but back in the day, to a five year old, it was colorful, vibrant, jumpy, loud, and off it's own medicine. I loved it. I saw love at first sight when I saw Marisol Nichols play Audrey. Then when I grew older, I questioned if continuity was even brought up when making this sequel. The children look nothing like they did in the first three films. Rusty was an average looking guy, but in this one his a very handsome, grown individual. Audrey has the biggest change of all. She was the homely child in the first three, but in this one she's got black hair and is amazingly gorgeous. Puberty did her well.But who cares? The jokes are somewhat fresh, the scenes are classic (my favorite being the dam boring tour), and the characters return to give it their all once more. Hard to believe that this would be the last time we see these characters in the flesh until thirteen years later when Chevy and Beverly would appear in the short Hotel Hell Vacation. I suspected something like National Lampoon's Australian Vacation, But it was still nice to see them back at it one more time.Vegas Vacation isn't perfect. You could almost think of it has a hopelessly lost spin off that doesn't take too many new routes, or even has appropriately placed characters. It doesn't even have the National Lampoon's name in the title. My only theory is that Warner Bros. (the company that distributed every other Vacation film) wanted to make another film in the franchise. They probably suggested the idea of Vegas with high hopes, National Lampoon maybe scrapped it, and WB went on to do it by themselves with no endorsement of National Lampoon. After all, they do own a part of the name, might as well milk it.No matter, Vegas Vacation is a film I'm proud to call one of my favorite comedies, and my second favorite in the Vacation franchise.Starring Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Ethan Embry, Marisol Nichols, and Randy Quaid.
