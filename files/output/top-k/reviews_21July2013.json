Perhaps this was to give the movie a more documentary style, but it didn't mesh well with the rest. In conclusion, if you want an action film with a smidgen of characterization, try the film.

I watched this with my 12 year old daughter... and once the film finished, she asked me if she could write the review for a change. I think she has done a great job with it too... This is her opinion. Sammy... take it away!It wasn't a bad movie, I did enjoy it.The story is about three models, Loco (Betty Grable), Pola (Marilyn Monroe) and Schatze (Lauren Bacall), who want to marry a millionaire. They rent an apartment in New York and sell all the furniture to get money. They spend a lot of time with rich men, but none of them are really their type. They persuade themselves that they are and end up falling in love with them anyway. But when Loco finds a man to bring her shopping home, he falls in love with Schatze. Knowing she is a model, he asks to see them in a private show. If Schatze knew he was a millionaire, he would look like a completely different person to her.I have never seen a storyline like this before, so I think is was original and creative. I can't say I didn't laugh when Marilyn walked into the wall, as she was playing a girl blind as a bat. She had glasses, but never wore them as she thought they made her look unattractive. Her mind was changed by one special man's opinion.One thing I didn't understand, is the guy with the eye-patch. He always had this patch over his left eye, but when he was examining a plane schedule, he lifted his eye-patch to get a better look. Surely, if you wear an eye-patch, it's cover up a missing eye, or something like that. But if he needs to take it of to read a schedule, why wear it at all? I don't get it...I do love my retro movies, which most people wouldn't expect from a twelve year-old girl, but it's true. This is a very old movie (to me, anyway) and this always means terrible effects, but why would you add the backgrounds as an effect, when they were just walking around a real set with the same background. They looked so fake it was unbelievable. Why not just film them in the set instead of recreating it with graphics? They confuse me.Overall, I think this movie is slightly amusing and generally enjoyable. I'm going to give this movie a 6 out of 10. I don't know why, it's just my gut instinct.Why marry a poor when you can find a rich man just as easy?Good work honey. I agree with Sammy mostly... I expected the effects to be terrible... the film was made in 1953. I also had never seen a Marilyn Monroe film, and she did a great job in this. She was very funny as a blind lady. She did make me laugh quite a lot throughout. The acting was good apart from Betty Grable. I thought she let the film down. She could have done better. The story was OK, but I thought it could have had a bit more happen, although I found it amusing how she rented out an apartment and sold the landlord furniture.

If you ever wanted to take a 90's nostalgia summer road trip, A Goofy Movie is a great place to start. The entire movie just screams 90's. When the animated series Goof Troop aired on television in 1992, it was very popular to the point that a sequel movie had to be made. In 1995, such a film was indeed made, titled 'A Goofy Movie'. Directed by Kevin Lima, the movie is about the father & son relationship between Goofy (Voice by Bill Farmer) and his son Max (Voice by Jason Marsden). Max got into trouble in school trying to impress the girl of his dreams, Roxanne (Voice by Kellie Martin), and now Goofy believes that Max is growing up too fast, and fears of losing him to a life of crime. While Max believes in his independence, and wanting no part with his father, Goofy. Goofy want to work on their tense relationship, by wanting a family cross country trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho for some father and son bonding while fishing. The only problem is that Max promised to Roxanne, the girl he has a crush on, that he'll be at the Powerline concert in L.A. This gives Max the problem of whether to tell the truth to Roxanne or screw up Goofy's fishing trip just to be at the concert. While the movie is a cartoon, and it has a lot of humor. I do find it's mature in some places. It focuses a lot of the chemistry between father and son. This was the first time, I even saw Goofy as a father figure. While on Goof Troop, Goofy was still a father to Max, but the character on the show never went into development. He was always a stupid adult of a person who can't do anything right. In the film version, we see how his dad's antics has alienated the boy to the point, that he fears being like him, due to people mocking them. Max is actually growing, and I can totally see him as a teen. Max is one of the most believable Disney character that I can related to. Max, much to his own dismay, takes after his father at times, whether it be mannerisms (including Goofy's trademark laugh) or occasionally being clumsy. He feels that he is much cooler than Goofy however, and is not as earnest and humble as his father, as he can be somewhat of a show-off at times when he excels at anything. Adolescents are very private about their interests and are especially reluctant about sharing them with their parents. While Goofy is still clumsy, he works hard to be a good father towards Max. Goofy wasn't one-dimensional in the film like he is in his earlier cartoons. Who knew, Goofy could show angry, pain, and love? It's one of the very first Disney movie seems to actually try and convey the generational conflict between parent and child; and portrays this relationship in a very real way, full of ups and downs. I can't think of another Disney movie before this, going to this level. I think the movie works so well because of that. I have a soft spot for this movie - simply because it mirrors a lot of people teenage years so much. The embarrassing parent, the awkward kid who just wants the world to know that they're more than just some curb stomp, and wanting to prove themselves. I have to admit, it was probably this movie that convinced me to come out of my shell and made the rest of my life more enjoyable and memorable. I have to say the humor works, physical slapstick, and jokes. Some of its jokes are pretty out there like odd breaking the fourth wall humor. I loved the Lester's possum park. I don't know if it was making fun of Disneyland or not, but it was funny. Always made me laugh. This always reminded me of Chuck E. Cheese. The big foot scene was hilarious as well. The supporting cast work even Pauley Shore as Max's friend, Bobby. I'm just glad, he had a small role. Good to see Jim Cummings voicing Pete. He is a voice actor legend. The animation was pretty OK, it wasn't catchy. It look like animation, you give a TV show, not a full length animation movie. The title also is kinda wrong. It's not a Goofy movie, but a movie about Max. Goofy only plays a supporting role in the film. Kinda like a second banana. I do have to say the movie have a musical like theme throughout the film. I love every song in the film. After Today is 'The Part of your world' emotional ballad for the Disney teenager male setting the table type song that mostly sang by Disney heroines. The Tevin Campbell songs 'Stand Out' and 'Eye and Eye' are catchy. On the Open Road and 'Nobody Else But You are just too cheesy for me. I don't know, but I always thought Powerline was supposed to be Bobby Brown or Michael Jackson. A direct to video sequel was made in 2000 worth checking out. The second uses a much more cliché theme of old vs. new, and though it does work and is interesting, never goes the extra mile to address anything of true importance. So I like this movie, better. Overall There is something for both parents and the children with this film. It just had the right mix of elements for me. It had an old concept, the buddy\/father-son\/coming-of-age adolescence film. But it did it in just a very fresh, very appealing way for me.

The Tevin Campbell songs 'Stand Out' and 'Eye and Eye' are catchy. On the Open Road and 'Nobody Else But You are just too cheesy for me. I don't know, but I always thought Powerline was supposed to be Bobby Brown or Michael Jackson. A direct to video sequel was made in 2000 worth checking out.

Overall There is something for both parents and the children with this film. It just had the right mix of elements for me.

If you ever wanted to take a 90's nostalgia summer road trip, A Goofy Movie is a great place to start. The entire movie just screams 90's. When the animated series Goof Troop aired on television in 1992, it was very popular to the point that a sequel movie had to be made. In 1995, such a film was indeed made, titled 'A Goofy Movie'. Directed by Kevin Lima, the movie is about the father & son relationship between Goofy (Voice by Bill Farmer) and his son Max (Voice by Jason Marsden). Max got into trouble in school trying to impress the girl of his dreams, Roxanne (Voice by Kellie Martin), and now Goofy believes that Max is growing up too fast, and fears of losing him to a life of crime. While Max believes in his independence, and wanting no part with his father, Goofy. Goofy want to work on their tense relationship, by wanting a family cross country trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho for some father and son bonding while fishing. The only problem is that Max promised to Roxanne, the girl he has a crush on, that he'll be at the Powerline concert in L.A. This gives Max the problem of whether to tell the truth to Roxanne or screw up Goofy's fishing trip just to be at the concert. While the movie is a cartoon, and it has a lot of humor. I do find it's mature in some places. It focuses a lot of the chemistry between father and son. This was the first time, I even saw Goofy as a father figure. While on Goof Troop, Goofy was still a father to Max, but the character on the show never went into development. He was always a stupid adult of a person who can't do anything right. In the film version, we see how his dad's antics has alienated the boy to the point, that he fears being like him, due to people mocking them. Max is actually growing, and I can totally see him as a teen. Max is one of the most believable Disney character that I can related to. Max, much to his own dismay, takes after his father at times, whether it be mannerisms (including Goofy's trademark laugh) or occasionally being clumsy. He feels that he is much cooler than Goofy however, and is not as earnest and humble as his father, as he can be somewhat of a show-off at times when he excels at anything. Adolescents are very private about their interests and are especially reluctant about sharing them with their parents. While Goofy is still clumsy, he works hard to be a good father towards Max. Goofy wasn't one-dimensional in the film like he is in his earlier cartoons. Who knew, Goofy could show angry, pain, and love? It's one of the very first Disney movie seems to actually try and convey the generational conflict between parent and child; and portrays this relationship in a very real way, full of ups and downs. I can't think of another Disney movie before this, going to this level. I think the movie works so well because of that. I have a soft spot for this movie - simply because it mirrors a lot of people teenage years so much.

I am able to recall seeing Disney films like Cinderella (1950) and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) for the first time at an early age. So it's no surprise that I'm still able to recall seeing Mary Poppins (1964) for the first time at a young age and remembering how special an experience it was. What makes it all the more memorable is that I still enjoy Mary Poppins looking back at it as an adult just as much as I did when I saw it as a kid. In my opinion, that's the key ingredient regarding what makes a children's film timeless in the first place. We follow an unhappy British family led by Mr. and Mrs. Banks (David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns, respectively) during the 1910s that are looking to hire a new nanny after their most recent one (Elsa Lanchester) quit. What they get is a magical nanny by the name of Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews in her amazing, Oscar-winning theatrical debut) who changes the entire family's lives forever. The kids (Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber) are taken on adventures beyond their wildest dreams such as jumping into chalk drawings, cleaning their room with the snap of their fingers, and other similar outings which are more magical than they sound. Joining with them on their adventures is an upbeat jack-of- all-trades by the name of Bert (Dick Van Dyke in a highly enjoyable performance). This film basically covers Mary's time with the family until the wind changes direction, both literally and metaphorically. What's fascinating about the story for Mary Poppins is that it teaches lessons not only to children, but also to adults. In its own unique way, it tells every family to meet in the middle between what the children expect from their parents and what the parents expect from their children. That means that parents should be more understanding of their children's playfulness and children should only have so much of a good thing. That's exactly the type of family dynamic that Mary Poppins tries to teach the entire Banks family through her own mysterious yet somehow smart actions. It is a profound and meaningful dynamic for any family to learn and strive for, and it's one crucial reason why Mary Poppins remains an original and unique family picture almost 50 years since it first came out. Looking back at it again, I just picked up on how funny, witty and charming this movie truly is. At times, the humor bares comparison with some of the greatest comedies of the 20th century like Duck Soup (1933) and Modern Times (1936). Other times, I was displaying an affectionate smile either for the terrific lines of dialogue made possible by writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, or recalling just how cool and charming every scene is. Remember the scene with Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) floating up in the air because he's laughing so hard? Remember the chimney sweeps, including Bert, doing some dangerous dancing on the rooftops? This film contains one great scene after another and at a running time of more than 2 hours, it all moves exceedingly well. If that isn't a compliment to Walt Disney's master storytelling skills, I don't know what is. I briefly mentioned earlier that this was Julie Andrews' acting debut as the main character Mary Poppins. Considering that she won an Oscar for her first performance, it's an impressive way to start out her career. Between her superb singing skills, her comfort in the role, and her overall excellent delivery, I can definitely see why she earned the Oscar. I know Dick Van Dyke received criticism for his British accent, but to be brutally honest, I never saw the problem because I don't know anything about true Cockney accents. I honestly loved Dick Van Dyke in this movie regardless. I thought he had charm and wit to spare, he worked very well with the kids, he always had a positive attitude, he was highly entertaining overall. Even David Tomlinson is outstanding as Mr. Banks. For me, this is the strict parental figure done right. He may be able to tolerate the playfulness of his children for a very limited time, but the filmmakers still made a likable character out of him and somehow make his stubbornness funny. I think we all know how great the music and songs written by Richard and Robert Sherman are here. We all remember the song Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious and the meaning of that unorthodox word. It's practically a word that's used when there's nothing else to say. How do you like that? There's a reason why this film is one of the only 2 Disney movies to be on the list of the AFI's 25 Greatest Musicals. The fact that it's filled with timeless songs such as A Spoonful of Sugar, I Love to Laugh and the Oscar-winning Chim Chim Cheree should explain enough. They're cheerful, they're memorable, they're catchy, the songs and music are everything you could ask for from a musical. Mary Poppins easily takes its place amongst the finest films that Disney has ever put out. The story flows very well at 139 minutes and the fact that it moves more efficiently than most films of that running time is further proof of Mr. Disney's superb talents as a storyteller. The music, the acting, the characters, the writing and even some of the special effects all come together in a wonderful family film that is practically perfect in every way.

I know Dick Van Dyke received criticism for his British accent, but to be brutally honest, I never saw the problem because I don't know anything about true Cockney accents. I honestly loved Dick Van Dyke in this movie regardless. I thought he had charm and wit to spare, he worked very well with the kids, he always had a positive attitude, he was highly entertaining overall. Even David Tomlinson is outstanding as Mr. Banks. For me, this is the strict parental figure done right. He may be able to tolerate the playfulness of his children for a very limited time, but the filmmakers still made a likable character out of him and somehow make his stubbornness funny.

It's practically a word that's used when there's nothing else to say. How do you like that? There's a reason why this film is one of the only 2 Disney movies to be on the list of the AFI's 25 Greatest Musicals. The fact that it's filled with timeless songs such as A Spoonful of Sugar, I Love to Laugh and the Oscar-winning Chim Chim Cheree should explain enough. They're cheerful, they're memorable, they're catchy, the songs and music are everything you could ask for from a musical. Mary Poppins easily takes its place amongst the finest films that Disney has ever put out.

I am able to recall seeing Disney films like Cinderella (1950) and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) for the first time at an early age. So it's no surprise that I'm still able to recall seeing Mary Poppins (1964) for the first time at a young age and remembering how special an experience it was. What makes it all the more memorable is that I still enjoy Mary Poppins looking back at it as an adult just as much as I did when I saw it as a kid. In my opinion, that's the key ingredient regarding what makes a children's film timeless in the first place. We follow an unhappy British family led by Mr. and Mrs. Banks (David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns, respectively) during the 1910s that are looking to hire a new nanny after their most recent one (Elsa Lanchester) quit. What they get is a magical nanny by the name of Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews in her amazing, Oscar-winning theatrical debut) who changes the entire family's lives forever. The kids (Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber) are taken on adventures beyond their wildest dreams such as jumping into chalk drawings, cleaning their room with the snap of their fingers, and other similar outings which are more magical than they sound. Joining with them on their adventures is an upbeat jack-of- all-trades by the name of Bert (Dick Van Dyke in a highly enjoyable performance). This film basically covers Mary's time with the family until the wind changes direction, both literally and metaphorically. What's fascinating about the story for Mary Poppins is that it teaches lessons not only to children, but also to adults. In its own unique way, it tells every family to meet in the middle between what the children expect from their parents and what the parents expect from their children. That means that parents should be more understanding of their children's playfulness and children should only have so much of a good thing. That's exactly the type of family dynamic that Mary Poppins tries to teach the entire Banks family through her own mysterious yet somehow smart actions. It is a profound and meaningful dynamic for any family to learn and strive for, and it's one crucial reason why Mary Poppins remains an original and unique family picture almost 50 years since it first came out. Looking back at it again, I just picked up on how funny, witty and charming this movie truly is. At times, the humor bares comparison with some of the greatest comedies of the 20th century like Duck Soup (1933) and Modern Times (1936). Other times, I was displaying an affectionate smile either for the terrific lines of dialogue made possible by writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, or recalling just how cool and charming every scene is. Remember the scene with Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) floating up in the air because he's laughing so hard? Remember the chimney sweeps, including Bert, doing some dangerous dancing on the rooftops? This film contains one great scene after another and at a running time of more than 2 hours, it all moves exceedingly well. If that isn't a compliment to Walt Disney's master storytelling skills, I don't know what is. I briefly mentioned earlier that this was Julie Andrews' acting debut as the main character Mary Poppins. Considering that she won an Oscar for her first performance, it's an impressive way to start out her career. Between her superb singing skills, her comfort in the role, and her overall excellent delivery, I can definitely see why she earned the Oscar.

At times the movie seems to be disorienting and flat, but it could be deliberate by the director to give the sense of the sex, drugs and rock and roll lifestyle (the highs and lows).Several mini-stories exist within the movie that seem to be pulled from real life (such as blood transfusions for The Rolling Stones guitarist, Keith Richards).There are groupies, drugs, televisions out windows and more.

You turn off the phone, put a do not disturb sign on the door, send the kids to the grand parents and put on the headphones.You also don't watch this with commercials.The acting was excellent as well the directing, the storyline was a bit far fetched for me but life does have characters who are this warped and egotistical.The scene I like the most is the day of the wedding scene.

I like it to but am bothered by some shifts in tone in the final third although I think Kubrick deserves credit for not dodging the issue of atrocities.I prefer war movies that don't glorify war more as in Platoon or the great German U-Boat film Das Boot (see it in German with English subtitles, when they overdubbed it in English they wrecked a great background soundtrack). All in all there's a bit too much flag waving in this for me but it's a great movie but I can help remembering that part of the promotion for Full Metal Jacket including displaying the novel that served as source material for it in supermarket checkout lanes. Seeing Kubrick's name on it I picked it up. The novel was called the Short Timers written by Marine Gustav Hasford who was in theater during 1968-69. The great prolific essayist, columnist, novelist, screen writer (including my favorite sci fi movie, a Boy and his Dog) Harlan Ellison said of Short timers It is one of the most amazing stretches of writing I've ever encountered. Even though I know this is a movie review, not a book review, I have to tell you the source for most of the movie was written largely in a different kind of English called jarhead lingo. It was very cool to read inspired sections that are prose written with those word. Unfortunately, way more people were interested in watching Kubrick's movie than reading the real deal, the book didn't sell well, his deal with Kubrick wasn't very good and Hasford died alone almost broke in a motel room in Greece of heart related diabetic problems.I don't know which is more heartbreaking. Hasford's early death or the fact that the Short Timers is out of print while people still buy Kubrick's movie and somebody gets paid. The book has now become a rather expensive collector's item selling online for between $15 and upwards of $400. If you Google the title and his name you'll find a link to a scribd page that will load the whole book like a pdf. But you can't save or download it without paying. But you can read it.

It all starts when the friends are on the ferry boat headed to the island. A couple of them decide to play a game, but it goes wrong and one of the boat crewmen gets injured. The group make their way to Muffy's large island home, and it isn't long before we see some of the character's being stalked and picked off by an unknown assailant. Eventually, it gets down to Kit and Rob to discover the murder mystery and save themselves from sure death...I enjoyed 'April Fool's Day' a lot. The twist at the end was actually not disappointing for me at all, I know it gets a lot of flack. I thought it worked well given the title of the film and how they explain it at the end. The acting was very good, it was great to see Amy Steel one of my favourite final girl's from the Friday the 13th series. She was great as the lead heroine Kit in this one. 'April Fool's Day' had great atmosphere to it, which made the film feel scary and gritty. You could feel the fear that the friends felt after discovering the first dead body. I highly recommend this. It's a late 80's slasher which isn't your typical slasher. It has the feel of it without the extreme gore, and a nice twist at the end to wrap it all up. Check it out. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 July 2013","score":"","review":" A group of college friends take a seemingly peaceful weekend trip to their pal Muffy's house on an island, however things get deadly in a hurry in 'April Fool's Day'.
