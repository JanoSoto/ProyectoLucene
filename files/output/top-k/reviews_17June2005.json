The best part is when Michael reaches the hospital and starts killing everyone and the scene where Michael kills the nurse in front of Laurie is intense and plus the big chase scene towards the end with Michael and Laurie is really nerve racking and well done.Donald Pleasence (Loomis) is great as always he really shows the more manic side to his character and gives a passionate, riveting performance. Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie) giving in my opinion an even greater performance than in part one although she does make one or two mistakes but what final girl doesn't, Jamie Lee Curtis is definitely the best final girl ever.

You would have thought that the absence of Arnie and the quiet, tension building jungle would wreck the film. Instead, it see's a different side to the Predator.Los Angles is the setting for this film, with a surprising date of 1997. The view of this year from a 1990 perspective is not bad at all. The settings and cast are all great, and make the film very atmospheric, because cleverly, the cast are all very stereotypical of modern American people - Bill Paxton plays a young, out going rookie cop with terrible jokes, the Jamaican drug gangs.. well enough said there. And Danny Glover plays a good typical cop, who looks as though he's had experience at his job and says a great line to Bill Paxton Welcome to the war (upon Paxtons joining of the cops) The Predators arrival is well noted after some Jamaican drug gang members get slaughtered and hung up. Of course, the Predator takes people out all the way through the film - his calling card being to hang his victims up, legs first. Somehow though, you get the impression that the Predator just doesn't belong in this city, and that he played a much better role in the first Predator film.The special effects are really no different than the first film. The predators invisibility still shown very cleverly by the magnified scenery, giving the outline of his body so we can see him. Again though, this works a lot better in the first film, because he camouflaged nicely in all the jungle. The addition of more weapons is very interesting though - a deadly round Frisbee and spear come in very handy.Of course though, the most talked about part of this film is the scene in which we see an alien head in the predators trophy cabinet.

At that time only a handful of adult sci-fi films had been released, almost all in the 1950s.This entry from George Pal was an important one, I suggest, following as it did on the heels of War of the Worlds, The Fountainhead and This Island Earth. The story device of time- travel was used often in the golden age of written sci-fi; only a few years after World Without End, this H.G. Wells' tale was granted a sufficient budget to suggest possibilities no filmmaker had yet grasped. The cast also seemed to be a good one, headed by Rod Taylor as the Time Traveler, likable Alan Young as David, Sebastian Cabot, Tom Helmore, Whitner Bissell, Yvette Mimeux and Doris Lloyd as the housekeeper. And the film that resulted from the creators' efforts, despite some refused attempts at idea-level subtleties which would have been welcome, turned out to have classic scenes, strong emotional appeal and genuine humor and entertainment values. In addition, the dialogue by David Duncan was very intelligent, and other elements such as the sets by F. Keogh Wilson and Henry Grace, the art direction, the music by Russell Garcia and the costumes were very good indeed. The six scenes that I have always loved best in the film are the great explanation scene wherein George, the time traveler, attempts to explain his new theory of time and its permeability to travel to his three best friends; the use of a department store window and its mannequin's costumes to delineate passing years and changing social mores; the arrival of the time traveler among a group called the Eloi--by whom he is ignored; the discovery of the crumbling books in a great library when George realizes they've let everything of civilization fall to pieces; the battle with the Eloi's overlords, the Morlocks, in a vast underground cavern; and the scene where David pieces together the disappearance of the time sled--and three books George has taken with him when he returns to the future, also asking, But which three books do ye suppose he took with him? Rod Taylor is quite stalwart and intelligent as the scientist; and the others, especially Young and Cabot very capable indeed. Yvette Mimeuxas Weenais lovely and quite childlike, the Eloi girl George saves; and the climactic battle, the victory over the Eloi and the denouement and ending are quite satisfying. Overall, the ideas in the film could have been more explicitly handled. But apart from this cavil, we as viewers I assert have much for which to be grateful here. We have a fine and very enjoyable sci-fi film to set beside, War of the Worlds, and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea and other achievements from the first concerted Age of cinematic science fiction.

But there's only one film where a girl clicks together a pair of ruby slippers.What that basically means is that the goal of many stories is essentially the same. The 'find your way home' example is used in films such as E.T., The Wizard of Oz, and Back To The Future, just to name a few. Only one of those has ruby slippers. Only one has a bicycle fly past the moon. Only one has a time-traveling Delorean.The goal of 'criminals getting together to pull off the perfect heist' has been used is such films as The Killing, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, and City on Fire...just to name a few. Only one had an un-chronological order to the events. Until Reservoir Dogs. Only one had the criminals use color-coded names to keep their identities anonymous. Until Reservoir Dogs. Only one had an undercover cop infiltrate a gang of crooks and befriend another crook, only to get shot during the process of the robbery, until he confesses the truth to his new friend. Until Reservoir Dogs.If you cannot see that this entire film is just a cut and paste job, then you have to be mentally impaired. And that is not an insult.As far as originality goes, Tarantino hasn't got to that point yet. The point where he creates something on his own. This is just a second hand, second rate cut and paste job that is only mildly entertaining on first viewing. Upon seeing the film subsequent times, it only gets worse, and it's (very many) flaws only stand out to an even more obvious extent. This is a bad movie even for someone who has never directed anything before in his life.The film starts with a discussion that might as well be about Jesus, pancake syrup, or the duties of the school crossing guard. None of these have anything to do with the story...much like the conversation we see before the opening credits roll. Which brings me to another discussion that takes place later on in the film...something about Lady E and a superglue incident. How is this any of our business? How does it advance the story? What do we get out of it besides a possible forced laugh of pity? It's not our business, it does not advance the story, and we get nothing out of that scene at all. You can literally remove it and be left with the same exact film, just without that scene. From the point before that scene started to after it finished, NOTHING HAS CHANGED AT ALL. It's complete filler. A total waste of time.This movie would have been pretty good without extraneous scenes floating around, popping up at random, and taking entirely too long to finish. The best example of this is the whole Tim Roth segment. It interrupts the flow of the story and it simply not fun to watch. It's a huge dead moment right before the climax of the movie and it's very easy to simply lose interest at that point. When the finale does come, it's more of a good, it's over point rather than any kind of realization. Tarantino couldn't even create a good third act when he literally just copied the third act from City on Fire, and in some cases...shot for shot! Resertvoir Dogs showed us nothing that we have not seen before...literally. The only positive thing about it is the cast, and that's even not so great. Most of the dialogue is just screaming and f-words being used like it's going out of style (and it has, thanks to films like this), and the infamous and extreme violence is about on par with The Lion King. So if you're thinking about watching this movie...just watch a good heist movie instead.

Which brings me to another discussion that takes place later on in the film...something about Lady E and a superglue incident. How is this any of our business? How does it advance the story? What do we get out of it besides a possible forced laugh of pity? It's not our business, it does not advance the story, and we get nothing out of that scene at all. You can literally remove it and be left with the same exact film, just without that scene. From the point before that scene started to after it finished, NOTHING HAS CHANGED AT ALL. It's complete filler. A total waste of time.This movie would have been pretty good without extraneous scenes floating around, popping up at random, and taking entirely too long to finish. The best example of this is the whole Tim Roth segment. It interrupts the flow of the story and it simply not fun to watch. It's a huge dead moment right before the climax of the movie and it's very easy to simply lose interest at that point. When the finale does come, it's more of a good, it's over point rather than any kind of realization. Tarantino couldn't even create a good third act when he literally just copied the third act from City on Fire, and in some cases...shot for shot! Resertvoir Dogs showed us nothing that we have not seen before...literally. The only positive thing about it is the cast, and that's even not so great. Most of the dialogue is just screaming and f-words being used like it's going out of style (and it has, thanks to films like this), and the infamous and extreme violence is about on par with The Lion King.

I really like Martin Brest too, his movies are great (Beverly Hills Cop\/Scent of a Woman) even Going in Style was OK, a bit slow but an excellent speech at the end! And yes, I do know he made Gee Lee! I refuse to see it. Maybe if it comes on TV, but I am not paying money to see that.

This is a great movie about everything going wrong and finially working out in the end.....a lot like life.

Basically Mr. Wing (Keye Luke) has died, and his Mogwai, Gizmo, has been captured by the scientific minds inside the genetics lab of a big New York business owned by mogul Daniel Clamp (John Glover). Working in the big office of New York are old friends Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) and Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates), and when Billy finds out Gizmo is in the building he is keen to take care of him. Kate is very worried knowing what happened last time when they forgot out the three rules, keep him away from bright lights especially sunlight which kills him, don't get him wet or they multiply, and don't feed them after midnight or they transform. Of course, once again these rules are unintentionally broken, and a new batch of Mogwai, soon to become nasty and ugly Gremlins, are set loose to cause chaos in the building. But the bigger problem with this new litter is that they are slurping their way through the various chemicals in the laboratory, giving hem many abilities, including speech, wings, arachnid qualities, and even stuff that stops their allergic reaction to sunlight. Of course as soon as gets dark outside that is when the Gremlins plan to break out into the city, but the humans have a plan to fool them into thinking it is dark, and in the end, they all get electrocuted to death.

The animatronic and small computer effects for the Gremlin creatures still do reasonably well, I like the fact that the film has in-jokes based on its own predecessor, as well as spoofing many other things, it certainly seems to be more childish, but that's not such a bad thing.

Working in the big office of New York are old friends Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) and Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates), and when Billy finds out Gizmo is in the building he is keen to take care of him. Kate is very worried knowing what happened last time when they forgot out the three rules, keep him away from bright lights especially sunlight which kills him, don't get him wet or they multiply, and don't feed them after midnight or they transform. Of course, once again these rules are unintentionally broken, and a new batch of Mogwai, soon to become nasty and ugly Gremlins, are set loose to cause chaos in the building. But the bigger problem with this new litter is that they are slurping their way through the various chemicals in the laboratory, giving hem many abilities, including speech, wings, arachnid qualities, and even stuff that stops their allergic reaction to sunlight. Of course as soon as gets dark outside that is when the Gremlins plan to break out into the city, but the humans have a plan to fool them into thinking it is dark, and in the end, they all get electrocuted to death. Also starring Mrs. Doubtfire's Robert Prosky as Grandpa Fred, Star Trek Voyager's Robert Picardo as Forster, Howie Mandel as Gizmo, Tony Randall as Brain Gremlin, Sir Christopher Lee as Doctor Catheter, Home Alone 3's Haviland Morris as Marla Bloodstone, Dick Miller as Murray Futterman, Jackie Joseph as Sheila Futterman, Keye Luke as Mr. Wing, Jerry Goldsmith as Yogurt Customer, Leonard Maltin, Police Academy's Bubba Smith and Hulk Hogan. The animatronic and small computer effects for the Gremlin creatures still do reasonably well, I like the fact that the film has in-jokes based on its own predecessor, as well as spoofing many other things, it certainly seems to be more childish, but that's not such a bad thing. Okay!

How it got there, I don't know. The film stars Danny Aiello (Do The Right Thing), Mike McGlone (The Brothers McMullen) and John Corbett (Sex and the City). Set in the fast paced New York Italian restaurant Gigino, we follow a restaurant owner (Aiello) and his son, the head chef, on a busy Friday night. The film is comprised of witty banter from different tables in the restaurant, following a uptight art critic, a mafiosi from Queens, a food critic and a real mystery man in Corbett's character. The staff has to deal with a power outage, whiny tables and a line chef who is into a bookie 35 grand. The film carries itself with panache every second, and no matter how often I see this picture, be it on DVD or on IFC, I just can't get enough. Check it out!

There is one thing that bothers me though- why was he supporting actor? It is true that he does not do very much in the narrative, which occupies the main core of the film, yet he is the narrator (like Morgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption, which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Leading Actor, and there was a debate about whether it should have been Tim Robbins), and given that he is the latent villain as well, should he not have been nominated as Best Leading Actor? Does anyone agree with me here? I am convinced that if he had been nominated for Best Leading Actor, he would have won the Oscar because his portrayal of the apparently weak yet sophisticated Verbal Kint was very powerful, especially since his role was very difficult to play (harder than his role as Lester Burnham in American Beauty, in my opinion).
