Whenever you make a movie about a specific subject that you don't know about (but you find interesting) it's important to get background info so your thesis will not mislead the viewer.  KIDS was misleading, so much so that if I flew to Earth from another planet, I would expect ALL 90s youth to be foul mouthed, drug dealing, abusing, sexually active scum of society. And is that true for every 90s teenager? Clark must have an agenda against children;  he was probably walking down his New York street one day when a bunch of young street hoods whacked him over the head with their skateboards and stole his money. And this film would be considered a way of getting back. This film wasn't commentary; it was exaggerated, vindictive rage.Despite the misinformation that this film is known for, it is also a slow and uninteresting one. The plot revolves around Telly, a 15 year old who deflowers teenage girls like what a chainsmoker does with Marbolos. When one girl (played by Chloe Sevigny) finds out she contracted AIDS from him, she must find him before he affects any more people. Like he really is going to listen to her. Sure. Okay, I'll just stop, go home, sip on some Beta Carotene cola, stay in bed, and watch 90210 reruns. Give my apologies to the people whose lives I've ruined, baby. Ta ta.Disney refused to take credit for this, and it nearly came away with an NC-17 Rating. But it got away with no rating instead, but with a viewer discretion is advised sticker.

I could care less what every other critic seems to say about this movie.  This movie is great, and if you can't see that then you need to open your eyes. With a creative team of Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer you know this movie will be action packed.  But, what I thought was the real selling point of this movie was the emotions that they tried to hit with the audience. When you watch the scene, in which the fallout sirens start, you can see something so human its scary and sad all at the same time, hopelessness. The cast is wonderful, blending old and new.  Bruce Willis plays Harry, the world's best oil driller.  Ben Affleck plays A.J., Harry's aspiring apprentice.  Billy Bob Thorton plays Truman, a NASA operator that relies on Harry to save us all.  Then, there always has to be the leading lady, Liv Tyler, who plays Harry's daughter and A.J.'s girlfriend.  I can agree that the depth in this movie is not what makes Oscar pay attention.  But, to counter that, I don't want to know the story of Harry's life like Roger Eibert may want to.  In a slower film I would, and maybe it wouldn't have been bad, but I DIDN'T NEED IT.  As with every Jerry Bruckheimer film the cinimatography was excellent.  He is the master at moving the camera and slowing the scene down at exactly the right time.  In other words, the camera moves beautifully.  Now, despite what you have heard, this movie has moments of blunt honesty and deep emotions.  The scene in which Grace asks A.J. if he thought that anyone in the world was enjoying a moment such as theirs, and he responds, quote, I hope so, otherwise what the hell are we trying to save. was one of the truest statements made in a recent movie. Then, there is A.J. screaming I love you as he is lifted from Harry back into the shuttle.  The rawness of the emotions are what make them work. This film would have been cheesy if it was these two sitting there on their way back to earth claiming their love and respect for each other.  A true unsung hero of this movie is the character played by Will Patton.  He was seemingly dark but really was sweet.  One other member of the cast that requires mentioning is William Fichtner as Col. Sharp.  He plays the scared, I only do what I am told fly boy so well.  And, then, the character change he undergoes is all summed up by him realizing that not always are your superiors right.  It's the little moments in this movie that really make it work.
