Thankfully Luc (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is around to try and take care of the matter. I'm not sure how many people were wanting a sequel to UNIVERSAL SOLIDER but this here certainly isn't a good movie on any level, although there are certainly some moments that are so campy that some might be able to get a laugh out of them. In terms of stories this one here really doesn't offer too much as the main goal of it is just to get Van Damme ready to fight just about anyone. You have to at least give the actor credit for remaining in shape and at least making it believable that he's still able to kick some butt. Performance wise he's also not all that bad and manages to have a lot more energy than he did in the first film. The rest of the cast doesn't come off that good and this includes Bill Goldberg as the main bad soldier. Some of his line deliveries got the biggest laughs of the film but there's no doubt the film wouldn't have been as entertaining without him. Michael Jai White also doesn't shine in his role as SETH. The action scenes are mainly pretty weak and the low-budget also shows because dozens of people get shot up yet you never see a drop of blood. I won't ruin the final action scene but the CGI effect used has to be one of the worst looking ever released.

Two couples decide to spend the night in a seedy carnival fun house (which has a reputation for being the site of the murders of two girls in another town, who's maniac was never caught), while there, they witness the murder of a psychic that they had visited early in the night, while the carnival was open, at the hands of a cleft-headed sideshow freak who hides his deformity behind a Frankenstien mask. On the run, the kids find that they can't escape & then get picked off one by one by the crazed maniac. I had a lot of fun with THE FUNHOUSE (no pun intended) it was quiet a treat to view the film again after having not seen it in many a year & best of all, despite when it was made, the film still holds up very well today & makes for a fun popcorn horror flick. The acting works reasonably well & director Tobe Hooper is able to deliver one of his best directorial efforts in his career. Particularly impressive is how he is able to deliver a gorgeous widescreen colour camera work. You could tell that he had a ball helping put together THE FUNHOUSE, which is probably best described as the equivalent of a ride on a ghost train. The film opens strongly as we see through the eyes of a masked prowler (a nod to HALLOWEEN) entering a girls bedroom to stab her while she takes her clothes off to get in the shower (In a terrific nod to PSYCHO). Universal also doesn't ignore their past horror heritage either, as the lead heroines younger brothers room is filled with classic posters & masks of all the Universal classic movie monsters like the WOLFMAN, Dracula & FRANKENSTIEN & THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTIEN is seen playing on the TV set the parents are watching, before the heroine leaves for the carnival & all of this is just in the first five minutes of the film!. Hooper also really milks the atmosphere for all it's worth, especially in the carnival attraction & fun house itself, with it's reasonably eerie look, with creepy looking dummies & mechanical laughing puppets & statues that adorn the fun house itself, while the carnival itself is decked out with various weirdos of all kinds, to creepy looking old bag ladies, crazed gun toting, possibly homicidal hicks, creepy carnival barkers (three of which are played quiet wonderfully by COLIN FINLAY), weird magicians who's closing act is murdering a girl on stage, with a poker through the heart while trapped in a casket, only for it to turn out to be a fake (a nod to Universal's Dracula, with us even receiving a history lesson on the man the famous vampire was based on), dirty odd ball bums, odd ball fortune tellers, a creepy old man peeking in on naked girls, weird monstrosities in jars & deformed animals in a freak show, in fact minus the kids & parents & the girls younger brother, no one seems to be completely sane & all of this lends to a creepy unsettling feel. The suspense & tension is great, as is the eerie carnival atmosphere & the great, eerie & haunting carnivelsque score by JOHN BEAL which next to the cool soundtrack that throws some eerie sounds from all areas of the screen, makes this one of the best horror soundtracks ever to grace a horror picture. The films kills are relatively bloodless (usually electrocutions & stranglings, not to mention some blood on the creatures claws, hangings & a few bloodless impaling) however & are few & far between, not to mention it takes it's time getting going, so hardcore horror buffs looking for some bloody action will no doubt be disappointed by this fact. But it's never boring & always has something going on to keep you interested in its plot, until the action kicks in. The film only falters when it shows the creature make-up up close, when it really should have been keep half hidden in the shadows, since you can clearly see most of the material used to make the freak make-up is rubber. Highly recommended horror buffs, this FUNHOUSE is definitely terrifying & worth the ticket price if you want to see a really good horror film that sadly doesn't seemingly get made anymore.**** stars ","genre":null},{"date":"14 November 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Universal Pictures entrusted their first major horror movie release in quiet some time into the hands of Texas Chainsaw Massacre director TOBE HOOPER, who does a marvellous job of delivering scare after scare in this above average horror film.
