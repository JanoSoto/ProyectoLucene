It starts lightly, almost giving the impression that the director new nothing of the real life in a courthouse; it gets better by showing some friction between mother and daughter-in-law...and then it portrays the strange ways of celebrating victory of a couple. Then comes the devily proposal...  Now he movie gets frightning, although in some shallow way.  But, as it turns out, after having seen it, when you look at it from a wide angle, this movie becomes quite ordinary. The plot does not surprise you, the intended surprises seemed  the work of an amateur writer, who thinks the best shocks come from those things that are supposed to surprise you (wow, the man is his father, wow, that´s his sister, wow, his wife did that, and he did that...).   It happens that, nowadays, movie fans do see  a lot of movies, from many years, from many directors, and it takes a good plot and good directing to really surprise them.  I foresaw some events quite a few minutes before I was shown them. Possibilly, lots of people saw it that way too.   But anyway, this is a good thing to watch.   The acting...   Well, Keanu Reeves is good, Charlize Theron is excellent - quite a revelation she is. But the real bomb, the true interest of this movie lies with Al Pacino. This actor is a phenomenon. He can be a gangster, a blind man... and the devil. He is an astonishing actor, one that will endure forever in our memory - like Spencer Tracy, Bogart, Cagney, John Wayne, Douglas, Connery, De Niro, Morgan Freeman, O´Toole. If I was given a choice between having a video-library of these actors  and all the special effects and great soundtracks in the world...I would choose the stories personified by these actor´s characters.  Al Pacino alone holds this movie above the average - and they didn´t even give him a great part. Between Pacino´s acting, Reeves´ performance and the revelation named Charlize Theron - and if you choose to consider a grade C+ plot...well, you get a good enough movie.   Too bad it ends in such a poor way - as if someone (the director, the cast, the producer, some big boss in the studio) were trying to rush it to the finishing.

Ugolin (Auteuil), whose selfishness and little guy envy lead him to do the harm that he does, is not a despicable character. We do not hate him the way Manon understandably does.

If you drop a frog in scalding water, he´ll try to jump, to get away from it. But when you boil  the water, slowly, with the frog already in it, the frog will dye, and that´s how the story, this story, goes.  Wonderful movie. Fine suspense, good plot (although not astonishingly original), good and well developed characters, good acting and believable special effects. And a fine soundtrack.  Pierce Brosnan is the man of the moment, no doubt about it. He is, by far, one of the best irish actors to appear on celluloid...and no one has yet seen his true potential. And this man knows his choices - he has the eye for detecting good scripts and good movies - from The Lawnmower Man, to Thomas Crown Affair.  Dante´s Peak is a movie about family. It portrays a small town where almost everybody would like to live in - cozy, small, nice, friendly. The delivering of a prize to the mayor of this town is a proof of that.  But before settling the viewer´s attention on Dante´s Peak, the director tells us what happenned to Brosnan's companion when a volcano somewhere in Colombia (?!) erupted. This introduces to the real undertone of the movie - it´s a tragic story, deep down.  Brosnan´s character (a vulcanologist - no kin to mr. Spock, he points out) warns the inhabitants of this town that something may be brewing beneath the earth. As usual, people do not believe him, as happens with every man or woman who tries to reveal new things or break news. This sets the tone for the rest of the movie...until, at last, something tragic happens.     The director showed a firm hand while shooting this story. It´s clear that he showed us and told us things exactly the way he wanted them to be showed or told. Ok, there is no surprise (at least not a big surprise) in the outcome of the story but there´s no need  for it. The sheer intensity of the events, the realism - all this is enough to grip the viewer from beginning to end. The menace to everyday normal life is tremendous, andfamilies must act accordingly or perish. The town perishes, some lives are lost - all due to lack of care and planning. So Dante´s Peak becomes, like Deep Impact, a warning.    Pierce Brosnan is great, Linda Hamilton is good enough, and the kids, the grandmother and the colleagues of Brosnan´s character are excellent.  The science behind the movie´s plot is accurate enough a la Hollywood, naturally.  When I saw this movie, I felt I was in front of a fine work.

Although there was singing, and it was boring, it was bearable! The design, especially of Moses' and Co's faces, which seemed to be based on Egyptian hieroglyphics, was very effective. This was well done, probably better than Disney, and it depicted Moses life in an interesting way. Such as his time living as a prince of Egypt then in the desert as a Hebrew. And considering this is an animated feature!There were events in this film that raised it above your average Disney flick. Examples include Moses' dream when he was a young man and he learns about the persecution of the Hebrews. When he encounters god in the form of the burning bush. And of course, the parting of the Red Sea. This last piece of animation is the best I have ever seen!!  CONCLUSION This movie is not just for the kids!!

This was well done, probably better than Disney, and it depicted Moses life in an interesting way. Such as his time living as a prince of Egypt then in the desert as a Hebrew.

We nurse some old wounds and forget others.Lone Star is about history.  Sure, it's about a man and a woman and a murder, about a small Texas town, about cultures colliding, about lies and secrets.  But it's about America in the dusk of the twentieth century. It's about coming to terms with history.Lines are drawn in this film, lines of demarcation between Anglos and Latinos and Blacks, between the old and the young, between the past and the present, between truth and memory.  Ultimately, Sayles tries to express that these lines are all results of failure to communicate, failure to come to terms (in the literal sense).  We are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past because we can't seem to learn to listen to one another, to look an old enemy in the face and see not an enemy but a man.If I've made the movie sound highfalutin' and inaccessable, I'm sorry, because it's also a compelling mystery (whose bones are buried on old firing range?), a sweet and sexy love story, and great fun to watch.I'm not one for ranking and lists, but if I had to name the best film of the last ten years (or may favorite film of the last ten years--they wouldn't be the same lists), Lone Star would be alone at the top.
