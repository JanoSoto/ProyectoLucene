[{"date":"13 April 2014","score":"","review":" I am Jack's review of the movie Fight Club. If you don't know what that means, it's just a small taste of how sardonic this whole film is.At first, I assumed Fight Club was just a movie about a bunch of guys beating each other up. From the moment it starts, however, it proves to be much more than that. It's actually a very strangely neurotic and mesmerizing descent into a testosterone-fueled madness. Actual fighting is limited; what you get instead is a storytelling experience that's so warped, it will challenge your perception of what is and isn't real in the film. The film itself even gets warped, with such bizarre effects as having single frames of images mixed into random spots, and one frenetic scene where the negative appears to come undone. Throw in some wild computer-generated modelling effects and some brisk editing, and the film becomes a highly stylized and entrancing experience.The story is a real doozy. It kicks off strong and hard, showcasing the insomniac protagonist and chronicling how he went from being an average office worker with everything into a deviant with nothing (and nothing to lose). Things get thrilling when the actual fight club takes off and anarchy starts to spread, but the main focus is always on exploring the characters, and it all builds up to an unpredictable climax. There is a massive plot twist in the mix, but it's one of those that holds up extremely well on repeat viewings (even though it can be a little hard to believe). Characters shine really well, thanks to their nuanced performances, their sharp dialogue, their convoluted relationships, and the nature of the plot, which really makes us stop and think about what's going on in their heads.There are a number of themes that can be extrapolated from this crazy story. The most blatant messages concern anarchy, as the characters constantly criticize the modern consumerist culture and emphasize letting go. Much of the story is really about them abandoning the common goals of wealth, success, or material things, and just being yourself. There are moments where the film also seems to dig up deeper metaphysical questions and meaning, especially regarding morality and the perception of reality.As noted above, the film has one heck of a style. The camera work is very solid and good, while the editing tends to be very inventive and wild. Acting is great; Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter are effectively perfect in their roles. Writing is awesome, and there are tons of great lines. This production uses some very great and detailed-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music by the Dust Brothers can be a bit nutty, but is mostly pretty awesome.Fight Club is a movie with some serious attitude and style.

Following the terminator is a member of the resistance sent to protect Sarah and ensure her survival. Its the classic story of the battle between good and evil but its much more than that.

Besides, there's some really great camera-work and editing in this film. For instance, when Sarah is at a night club at one point in the movie both the Terminator and Kyle are there looking for her and when the terminator sees her, the action slows down in motion and the music in the club is replaced by the threatening terminator sound which intensifies the scene. And the soundtrack which is 80s synthesized music also dates the movie but the original Terminator theme is still iconic because when you listen closely it sounds like a metallic heartbeat but I digress.Because of the success of this film, James Cameron went on the map as a filmmaker and went on to make other great films including his own sequel that surpassed the original in so many ways.

A fun with that also packs a punch, Bond goes through a story with big villains with monster like henchman and with everything sparkling In gold, what else you could you want from a Bond movie, I felt this film was a safely very good and here below is why I felt that.The Story is fast and fun and with big things going on and a very dramatic but action packed story, the plot is fun and brings you really into the story. I loved the pace and where Bond goes and who he meets with some spectacular sets and parts where it may be slightly slower but then suddenly it speeds up and. Finally with the plot it has a good amount of thrilling parts, with the beginning and end being that, with the middle of the plot sandwich being Bond figuring out what is going on, great stuff.Connery does well in the lead role again and firmly brings out what we want to see from Bond, and with his gadgets and such to help, Connery isn't left without any help in his third outing to entertain us. I liked the villain Auric Goldfinger but it has to be said most of his shots when he is being his ever evil self involve Oddjob his devout henchman who's hat throwing skills make his of the most memorable people from this film if not of any film in the Bond series. Honor Blackman as the Bond girl I didn't feel was massively good but she carries Bond along well and make a different Bond girl than most of them we see.The script was good and contributes highly to Connery's great one liners he dishes out al through the movie. I loved the gadgets involved and is one of the Bond's that is actually good with the use of gadgets, for example like his Aston Martin with the revolving license plate and it's great gun's + more, you can't ask for much more in that department. Finally technical wise, it feels very well done as a production and although some films around the time has shabby and dim lit sets, Bond's sets are great big ones and even one of the more humble Bond's.The film isn't without criticism, it has it's parts where it drags just a little, but to be fair to the film the good parts basically make up for the parts where it maybe slightly misses the mark. I also felt the story is kind of ridiculous and that although most critics and audience alike like the film, many I feel would have to admit that the story Is kind of far fetched for even a Bond Movie, can't damn it for it's wacky ideas though.Bond fans should fall in love with this and probably already are with stereotypical Bond all the way through this, and with ease. Those who enjoy the three genres Bond is, Action, Adventure and Crime will not displeased by this as it also represents them in a good way with the villain being a good criminal, Bond fights a lot and with that he goes to a lot of different places also.It is safely very good, I will disagree with those who think it is a GREAT film but nevertheless I can see why they feel that way about this. Connery really brings Bond to life here and with thrill and a suave personality that just makes you want to see them all, by far this is Connerys best and wouldn't be surprised if you thought this was THE best Bond film of the entire film series.

While it was a Hollywood film, it displayed a huge influence of the European New Wave. Not only this but it also tapped into the concerns of the counter-culture, with its story about the generation gap from a youth-oriented perspective. As it turned out, it was a huge commercial success and led in a large part to the brief but significant age of New Hollywood, a time when the American studios systematically turned out challenging, left-field movies. The story has a young man, Benjamin, arrive back into the folds of the family home from college after graduating. Immediately he finds himself lost and alienated by what's expected of him by the older generation. One of his parent's friends Mrs. Robinson soon ensnares him into a sexual relationship, one that is emotionless but which becomes extremely acrimonious when Benjamin falls in love with Elaine, Mrs. Robinson's daughter.Aside from the reasons I mentioned above, The Graduate was important for the idea of having a romantic leading man as unconventional as Dustin Hoffman. His slightly nerdy and nervous persona was quite different from the character from the novel on which the film was based but he was a perfect choice in the role and several less obvious lead actors would rise to the top in his wake. In this movie he takes centre stage alongside Anne Bancroft (Mrs. Robinson) in a generational gap relationship that also was far from the norm. Bancroft is also extremely good here in a role where much goes unsaid, which requires very good acting. The timing of the release coincided with a period where youth generation were questioning the values of their elders like never before as a result of issues such as the Vietnam War. In this way Benjamin is an identification figure in that he is consistently used and instructed by his elders. This leads to an ending where the young rebels do what is right for them. But it's hardly a typical Hollywood ending, as after the elation of their act of defiance the camera stays on the couple and catches their uncertainty once their euphoria has died down. It's a European influenced ambiguous ending that shows that the young, like their elders, don't have all the answers either. Likewise, the film is ambiguous in other ways in that the lead character himself isn't really all that good a guy. He may be coerced into having sex with Mrs. Robinson but he chooses to carry on with this potentially devastating affair. Also, his pursuit of Elaine borders on the behaviour of a stalker. And it isn't in fairness ever really that obvious what Elaine, played by the gorgeous Katharine Ross, actually sees in Hoffman's rather strange Benjamin. In fact, it's a movie where it's quite easy to see everybody's point-of-view. We understand everyone's motivations, including the poor Mr. Robinson who has to endure Benjamin firing into both his wife and his daughter. For this reason, it left me with more questions than answers at the end and I couldn't 100% go along with Benjamin's elation.But what elevates The Graduate to true greatness for me is that it combines all these interesting aspects and brings them to the screen in such an alluring way. The camera-work is beautiful throughout and often very inventive, with some neat editing tricks where scenes interconnect excellently. Sometimes it's even done for comic effect, like the diver scene, but the cinematography composition often highlights themes like alienation and entrapment. The photography, though gorgeous, isn't just for show. And to top things off, we have a marvellous folk-rock score from Simon & Garfunkel which has become so famous it can be easy to forget just how good it is in the first place. In particular, the stunning Sound of Silence resonates and is just perfect for this film.

Bancroft is also extremely good here in a role where much goes unsaid, which requires very good acting. The timing of the release coincided with a period where youth generation were questioning the values of their elders like never before as a result of issues such as the Vietnam War. In this way Benjamin is an identification figure in that he is consistently used and instructed by his elders. This leads to an ending where the young rebels do what is right for them. But it's hardly a typical Hollywood ending, as after the elation of their act of defiance the camera stays on the couple and catches their uncertainty once their euphoria has died down. It's a European influenced ambiguous ending that shows that the young, like their elders, don't have all the answers either. Likewise, the film is ambiguous in other ways in that the lead character himself isn't really all that good a guy. He may be coerced into having sex with Mrs. Robinson but he chooses to carry on with this potentially devastating affair. Also, his pursuit of Elaine borders on the behaviour of a stalker. And it isn't in fairness ever really that obvious what Elaine, played by the gorgeous Katharine Ross, actually sees in Hoffman's rather strange Benjamin. In fact, it's a movie where it's quite easy to see everybody's point-of-view. We understand everyone's motivations, including the poor Mr. Robinson who has to endure Benjamin firing into both his wife and his daughter. For this reason, it left me with more questions than answers at the end and I couldn't 100% go along with Benjamin's elation.But what elevates The Graduate to true greatness for me is that it combines all these interesting aspects and brings them to the screen in such an alluring way. The camera-work is beautiful throughout and often very inventive, with some neat editing tricks where scenes interconnect excellently. Sometimes it's even done for comic effect, like the diver scene, but the cinematography composition often highlights themes like alienation and entrapment. The photography, though gorgeous, isn't just for show. And to top things off, we have a marvellous folk-rock score from Simon & Garfunkel which has become so famous it can be easy to forget just how good it is in the first place. In particular, the stunning Sound of Silence resonates and is just perfect for this film.

This movie is the cream of the crop when it comes to writing, acting, and overall storytelling. Even with its long runtime, it engages you from the very beginning. Should we expect anything different from guys like Robert De Niro and Sergio Leone? Nope, but nonetheless its a cinematic achievement. It really builds one of the great friendships that I can remember in movies. James Woods and De Niro have impeccable chemistry and make us believe they really are friends. Major props go to the younger cast as well.One of the best parts about this movie is that it takes place in different time periods, and by the way the filming and cinematography makes you believe you are with them in that time. I really liked how they didn't tell it necessarily in chronological order. You see old De Niro, you see 30's De Niro and you see young young De Niro. It gives you more than a glimpse into his life at each point in time. The younger cast of the friends turned gangsters were great because they not only had great chemistry but they looked and acted just like there older selves. That's very hard to do in movies. I mean seriously the kids looked just like their older selves did. Jennifer Connelly anyone? It was great to see these characters go through their trials and tribulations as young adults together and see how if affected them in the future. The music was a major bright spot in the film as well. The score by Morricone captured the friendship and sometimes heartbreak between the group of friends. There are so many positives to this movie that I cant write enough.The length is just a minor problem but really its forgiven with how great the script is. But my one problem was the sometimes uncomfortable feeling that I had while watching this. There are scenes that really make you despise these characters and then you are all of a sudden suppose to feel for them in the end? That is one huge problem with doing villain movies, it becomes very hard to root for them in the end. I'm not saying these characters are villains, but the disgust that I had with some of them didn't make me have any sympathy when something would eventually go wrong for them.But a great watch that is filled with fantastic performances all around.

I didn't see the clues or hints. I didn't see them at all. It completely came as a shock. And when I watched it again, I saw it in a completely different way. It felt like I had watched not one, but two films. Very rarely does a film this perfect come out. A film that hits everything it wants to and possibly even more. From the bright red coloured objects in high strung moments to the scene where the girl's father finds out that his wife poisoned their daughter, it simply gets everything spot on.The fear factor isn't what makes this film good. It shouldn't be compared to other horrors. It's trying to send different messages across. It has very few 'jump' scenes and moments that make you feel cold. It is supposed to make you feel for the dead and become understanding. It makes you feel how the boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), feels throughout the movie. And, most importantly, it makes you feel for the doctor, Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), in the final scene. It is a very unique, exciting film.M. Night Shyamalan both writes and directs this nigh perfect film. He makes every scene, every revelation, have the perfect feeling to it. Somehow, he makes us feel how the two main protagonists feel throughout the movie through both the writing and directing. One big problem people seem to have with 'The Sixth Sense' is Malcolm Crowe. People dislike how he could spend years with his wife and not realise that he was dead and she couldn't see him.If you pay attention, you'll see that he skips through his daily life. He misses certain parts, even days, without realising. A big example is when he can't open the basement door. He reaches for his keys in his pocket, but then he's in the cellar. He never got his keys out, he's supposed to have just appeared there without realising he hadn't opened the door. This happens at other moments in the film, if you look closely. He just appears with Cole or his wife, shifting between the two.The film really is a masterpiece. You'll probably miss many rules and clues throughout the movie, as I did, so I suggest you watch the special feature 'Rules and Clues' which is very interesting and explains things you miss or problems you think there are when there aren't. Unlike most special features, this film has interesting ones with Shyamalan and the crew, who also did a fantastic job creating the movie. I highly recommend the features nearly as much as I do the film.Overall, a very nice film made a masterpiece by the final moments. Throughout the entire thing, I felt that Malcolm was helping Cole, but it turns out they were both helping each other, Cole actually helping Malcolm more than Malcolm is Cole. A film that you watch entirely differently a second time around must be one of the greatest. This deserves to be in the Top 100 films, but I'm satisfied with its current placing.

More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of The Godfather, which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.The Godfather himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old- fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although The Godfather is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).The success of The Godfather as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so The Godfather becomes something of a rarity a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish- brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other.

A baby fox, whose mother just got killed, is discovered by a kind old lady named Widow Tweed. Seeing that he needs a motherly figure to take care of him, Tweed adopts this baby fox and names him Tod. Next door, a hunter named Amos Slade (Jack Albertson, aka Grandpa Joe from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971)) has just bought a new hound puppy named Copper for his hunting dog Chief to train. One day, Tod and Copper start becoming play buddies and eventually declare they want to be friends forever. Trouble ensues however when Amos insists that Copper (Kurt Russell) stays home where he belongs and Tod (Mickey Rooney) accidentally causes too much trouble for both Copper and Tweed. Will Tod and Copper's relationship stay the same, even when they'll become the biggest enemies when they're all grown up?The Fox and the Hound is another one of those films where the filmmakers are mostly efficient in terms of telling the story, and yet one can't shake off a feeling of emptiness after watching it. You have outstanding film legends such as Mickey Rooney and Jack Albertson supplying stellar voice-over work. You've got the good old Disney visuals with their lush colors and backgrounds along with their warm and expressive character animation. You also have a story that supplies a good lesson for kids regarding the values of friendship. There are a handful of things like the ones I just listed that should make The Fox and the Hound good enough for me to recommend. But then, there was an unmistakable emotion I was feeling while watching it again years after I last viewed it. This emotion I'm referring to is, for lack of a better word, boredom. Yes, even solid voiceovers, nice animation and an admirable premise can't quite save a film like The Fox and the Hound from being so drenched in averageness. You'll notice that I didn't even go into detail regarding the other supporting characters in this film. Don't worry, you're not missing a thing. I highly doubt that anyone, including myself, will even remember they were even there let alone remember their necessity to the narrative. So, let's just leave it at that. As for the film's songs, I don't remember one. There were even one or two cases where a song was clearly there, but I just had to listen carefully since I didn't hear singing. Not like the Disney music we're used to, is it? But whatever songs were clearly sang, they were all fairly dull anyways. In short, the songs and side characters could have easily been scrapped considering they're hardly even there to start with. The stronger aspects of this Disney flick reside whenever we focus on the complications that arise between these two friends when they're all grown up. You couldn't have asked for a better ending for this film if you tried. It stays true to the relationship between Tod and Copper without betraying the audience by completely making them into something they're not. Tweed's also an intriguing parental figure for Tod in that she goes back and forth between being very forgiving of Tod's mischief and trying to teach Tod to avoid getting in trouble. Aside from that, there really isn't much else to discuss regarding The Fox and the Hound. It's a harmless flick for little kids to see one time, but not much else. Take my advice for what it's worth. Not one of my favorites from the Disney canon.

There are a handful of things like the ones I just listed that should make The Fox and the Hound good enough for me to recommend. But then, there was an unmistakable emotion I was feeling while watching it again years after I last viewed it. This emotion I'm referring to is, for lack of a better word, boredom. Yes, even solid voiceovers, nice animation and an admirable premise can't quite save a film like The Fox and the Hound from being so drenched in averageness. You'll notice that I didn't even go into detail regarding the other supporting characters in this film. Don't worry, you're not missing a thing. I highly doubt that anyone, including myself, will even remember they were even there let alone remember their necessity to the narrative. So, let's just leave it at that. As for the film's songs, I don't remember one. There were even one or two cases where a song was clearly there, but I just had to listen carefully since I didn't hear singing. Not like the Disney music we're used to, is it? But whatever songs were clearly sang, they were all fairly dull anyways. In short, the songs and side characters could have easily been scrapped considering they're hardly even there to start with. The stronger aspects of this Disney flick reside whenever we focus on the complications that arise between these two friends when they're all grown up. You couldn't have asked for a better ending for this film if you tried. It stays true to the relationship between Tod and Copper without betraying the audience by completely making them into something they're not. Tweed's also an intriguing parental figure for Tod in that she goes back and forth between being very forgiving of Tod's mischief and trying to teach Tod to avoid getting in trouble. Aside from that, there really isn't much else to discuss regarding The Fox and the Hound. It's a harmless flick for little kids to see one time, but not much else. Take my advice for what it's worth. Not one of my favorites from the Disney canon.

This is where it all started for Wes Anderson and despite not being a box office hit he slowly built a reputation for himself by remaining unique to his quirky sense of humor. Many criticized the fact that these characters didn't seem real, and that is probably true for all of Anderson's film where he focuses on dysfunctional characters with a whimsical sense of humor. Anderson's comedies are very different and they aren't for mainstream audiences, thus the reason why the screening of this film scored the worst test screening points in the history of Columbia Pictures during that time. I am glad Wes stayed true to his style and didn't sell out because his next films share similar trademarks which he began establishing in Bottle Rocket. This is perhaps his most normal looking film if you take into account the cinematography, but the quirky sense of humor is pretty much the same as well as some other technical aspects of the film (the font title cards at the beginning and the slow motion shot at the end). The same can be said for Owen Wilson who kind of plays this dumb but nice guy character in most of his comedies. It's not Anderson's best work, but his quirky style began taking shape with Bottle Rocket. The screenplay was co-written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson from a short they had made a couple of years earlier. The film opens with Dignan (Owen Wilson) trying to help his best friend, Anthony (Luke Wilson) escape from a mental institution. Dignan has designed a great escape plan, but what he doesn't know is that Anthony can leave the institution upon his free will considering he voluntarily signed up for it after he had a nervous breakdown from exhaustion. This opening scene clearly establishes that Dignan is less sane than Anthony. He has established a long term plan for the two involving a criminal spree. The first step is robbing Anthony's mother's house but they can only take a few valueless items. The idea is that they get some criminal experience so they can catch the attention of Dignan's former boss, Mr. Henry (James Caan), who is sort of a legend in the criminal world. Next they plan a bookstore robbery, but this time they will need a getaway driver so they convince their friend Bob (Robert Musgrave) to join them. After successfully achieving their plan they hide out at a nearby motel where Anthony falls deeply in love with a Paraguayan maid named Inez (Lumi Cavazos). This is where the dysfunctional group of friends breaks down and things take a turn for each one of them.Bottle Rocket was on Martin Scorsese's list of his top 10 favorite movies of the 90's. The quirky sense of humor isn't for everyone, but fans of Wes Anderson's comedies will really enjoy this considering it was the birthing point of some of his technical achievements. It may be less depressing and cynical in tone than some of his other comedies, but the whimsy characters he creates are very familiar. You can clearly see the fascination he has for exploring these dysfunctional relationships of dorky middle to upper class people. It's a refreshing film and very different from your standard buddy comedy. It's witty and despite not having many hilarious moments, the film does manage to keep a smile on your face for most of its runtime. For a debut performance Owen Wilson really shines on screen and delivers his lines with perfect timing. I really enjoyed this offbeat comedy although I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who isn't a fan of Wes Anderson. I always recommend my favorite, The Royal Tenenbaums, to people who haven't seen any of his film.

But Wyatt does have a computer, and Gary convinces him to simulate a woman with the hotness of a Playboy model and the personality of David Lee Roth. One lightning bolt later, and presto, there's Kelly LeBrock in panties and a halter top, ready to make their dreams come true.Honeybuns, you wanna party so badly, you can bottle it, she tells Wyatt. If you wanna be a party animal, you have to learn to live in the jungle.Weird Science is an outlier among Hughes' teen movies of the period, which tended to present more authentic emotions in pursuit of comedy. Still, Lisa, as LeBrock's character is known, is of a piece with Bender in The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, the rule-bender who has to teach some young charges about escaping adult preconceptions.Employing the outright fantasy of a dream girl with magic powers for such a function could be useful, if the characters were better developed or the comedy funnier. Sadly, Weird Science is a kind of rush job, most of the humor being in the form of crude embarrassment gags on Gary and Wyatt, and their reactions to same. An opening sequence shows them staring at a gym full of teenaged girls, until their reverie is interrupted by a pair of toughs who pull their pants down. That's all the scene has, and it's par for the course.One of the toughs is played by Robert Downey, Jr., making a minor impression except for his hair, which is tousled like a firework. Hall wins the prize for Biggest Big '80s do, though, a layered flip of such intricacy it had to take the boy all morning to set it. Hall is the star of the show, something he earned with his great supporting turns in Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles, but Hughes doesn't do him any favors here, letting him overplay too many scenes while Mitchell-Smith winces and grins in fey support.LeBrock does better, in part because she knows she's playing a special effect and has fun with it. People talk about her amazing body, but her kissable mouth is equally lust-inducing.

Keeping that social consciousness in mind, what strikes me most about this movie is its daring subject that is so beautifully handled and adapted to the screen that hardly any directors can do nowadays. As nicely noted by Rudy Behlmer in a disc commentary on the movie, Elia Kazan's good relations with Tenessee Williams resulted in an almost flawless screen adaptation, very skillful direction and unique handling of the subject. Elia Kazan approached the material (Jeff Young)...but where do the strengths of the movie lie that, despite certain remakes, we still come back to its superior realism and magic? Kazan's production is a movie of old\/new Hollywoodat made at the turn of the periods, which Tom Nixon nicely develops in his review. And yet, it is being watched as a very modern approach to characters, to human personality, to its various torments and sophistication, to its complex nature. Rightly, therefore, Roger Ebert points out in his review (Nov. 1993) that watching the film is like watching a Shakespearean tragedy. Consequently, it can be called an old movie with a new subject. That universal and timeless nature of the content is achieved thanks to Method acting that makes the movie a fascinating, wrenching character study (Montreal Film Journal). Characters herein depicted are the true 'heroes' of the story and the ones that we try to understand, whose motives we try to analyze, whose past we try to uncover.And with that point, the movie's exception evokes even stronger. I cannot think of any other film that, to such extent, manages to call viewers attention of a male and a female character alike (in case that this woman and man are not a couple of a love story). As a rather newcomer at the time, Marlon Brando (his second screen role) and already a great star Vivien Leigh appear to stand out among the best character portrayals ever. While quite opposite in their nature and the very fundamental features, they display deep affinity and deep discrepancy alike making their roles a psychological feast.VIVIEN LEIGH whose face almost blank with desire (Ebert) arises from steam like Garbo in ANNA KARENINA, she embodies all contradictory motives that lie behind the haunting past of a girlish lady. As desperately lonesome, and a sexually hungry woman posing as a sad wilting flower (Roger Ebert), Vivien Leigh perfectly manages to prompt certain empathy as well as keep viewers constantly alert. Meanwhile, she maintains 'healthy distance' towards anything she does and anything she says. Bosley Crowther memorably observes in his review that she is a woman of even greater fullness, torment and tragedy that the previous portrayals could ever accomplish. Sometimes, she is the one to be pitied, sometimes, the one to be criticized but never blamed. With her final line that has almost become the movie's symbolic impact I have always depended on the kindness of strangers she portrays a character who belongs everywhere and, at the same time, nowhere. A sort of 'psychological harlot' but also an endless walker, in constant search of something. In a scene with Mitch (Karl Malden), she purely reveals the desire to love, to have someone close. In her instance, we might say that the Code did a better job because assuming slowly from her past, the viewing experience corresponds nicely to a depiction of human mystery.On the verge of naturalism, MARLON BRANDO whose sticking shirt, brooding looks, embarrassing and an almost exhibitionist behavior is remembered as one of the most male - animal portrayals on the screen, the portrayal of Tennessee Williams' rough, smelly, sexually charged hero (Roger Ebert). No wonder he has been hailed by critics as the one who makes his character a riveting, rough, sensual man's man (Montreal Film Journal), some bastard child of Achilles or King Kong...the crowning champion of the new era (Nixon), highly charged (Crowther). It is funny in a way but he manages to combine disgust and awe. As if constantly in an 'erotic aura' he creates a savage picture of a man who relies primarily on muscles. In an implicit scene of raping Blanche, his animal drives reach the pinnacle of self admiration expressed in making a woman an object of his satisfaction. But, again, to the very last minute, we cannot say that he is 100% bad and that is the supreme human achievement of the movie. Sometimes, he is tough, very brutal, almost unendurable and a 'beast' reduced to the gutter hardly to be pitied; sometimes, he is weak as a child in cry for a person at his side. In an almost unforgettable scene at the staircase (mind you the purely Hollywood effect of staircase scene), in his despair, he calls for Stella, his wife. The growing claustrophobia of the scene along with the perfect camera work and closeups makes the scene almost to be emotionally and erotically experienced. Just a note famous actor Jack Palance here began his acting career as Brando's understudy.SUPPORTING CHARACTERS Crowther rightly notes that others from the cast fill out the human pattern within a sleazy environment that is so fitly and graphically created that you can almost sense its sweatiness and smells. A note, of course, must be made of Kim Hunter as Stella, Blanche's sister and Stanley's wife and Karl Malden as Mitch, more of a sap (Ebert), a typical mom's boy who seems to do anything for his mother and, yet, appears to hate her deep down. A theme that has come back at Hitchock's with a more psychological space given to the depiction.Towering performances, flawless atmosphere and a highly respectful direction make it a milestone movie at multiple levels, a significant moment in movie history, and a movie that will fill you with a desire to see it again.

A note, of course, must be made of Kim Hunter as Stella, Blanche's sister and Stanley's wife and Karl Malden as Mitch, more of a sap (Ebert), a typical mom's boy who seems to do anything for his mother and, yet, appears to hate her deep down. A theme that has come back at Hitchock's with a more psychological space given to the depiction.Towering performances, flawless atmosphere and a highly respectful direction make it a milestone movie at multiple levels, a significant moment in movie history, and a movie that will fill you with a desire to see it again.
