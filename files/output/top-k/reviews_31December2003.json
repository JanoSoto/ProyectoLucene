Gina Gershon is the ball busting ex wife and Warren is that girl from special school who is still wearing nappies. Retards and bit**es.

They call it a Main Bus B Undervolt, but whatever the case, it cripples the spacecraft Apollo 13 just as it is about to reach the moon, forcing the crew to abandon their mission and undergo some hasty improvisations in order to make it back to Earth alive.There's a lot of technical jargon spewed in this film, not as much as was actually uttered on the spacecraft and at Mission Control in Houston, but enough to befuddle those of us who dozed off in science class back in high school. Still, I enjoyed this film, even when I didn't quite understand it.Tom Hanks stars as steady-in-zero-G Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell, successfully underplaying the heroics without losing the dramatic urgency of the moment. Early in the movie, we see him joke with his wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) with the sort of easy banter those of us who have followed him since Bosom Buddies are accustomed to. There's a funny scene early on, as he watches the Apollo 11 landing with a roomful of simultaneously proud and jealous fellow astronauts, all yelling at the television to abort seconds before Neil Armstrong takes his one small step for man. It's funny because they all wanted to be first on the moon, and also, in a ghoulish kind of prefiguring way, because aborting the mission is exactly what is going to happen to poor Jim.There's also an early scene between Lovell and his youngest son, when the father is asked if he knew the crew of Apollo 1, who perished in a capsule fire scene in an opening sequence. Hanks answers matter-of-factly, with a mesmerizing combination of steely control and compassion for what his child is experiencing. There's a lot going on under the surface, and while it's my favorite scene, it's easy to miss. Many good moments like that are sprinkled like stardust throughout the picture.The movie is a fine, solid piece of entertainment, a little loose with the facts but essentially true to what Apollo 13 was about, but what makes this especially recommendable is the DVD, particularly the commentary track by the real Jim and Marilyn Lovell (SPOILER ALERT He did survive.) At one point, when the film has Hanks imagining himself landing on the moon, the real Marilyn Lovoll audibly breaks down as she describes her sadness that her husband would never have this moment in reality (though what he got instead, however harrowing, turned out to be far more memorable than merely being Moon Man #5.) Jim himself is laconic as he fills in gaps in the storyline and explains where the film took liberties, meanwhile giving us a sense of where Hanks got his character from. For that, and many other reasons, this is a prize DVD for anyone's collection.A good feeling for the period abounds. We see smoking in the control room, miniskirts, floral upholstery, and ugly shagwall sideburns. The Lovells' oldest daughter has a conniption the day of the launch because the Beatles have just broken up, one of the things the Lovells address as a liberty in their commentary (she wasn't that much of a Beatles fan) but does make sense, because April 1970 was the month Paul McCartney announced the end of the band.Director Ron Howard piles on the technical detail. He wants us to understand just how tough it was to get Apollo 13 back, on enough power to barely run a coffee machine. He doesn't shirk from showing us a control room that is stacked to the rafters with what Howard himself calls techno-nerds with pocket protectors who emerge as real heroes in one of NASA's darkest hours. You have Todd Louiso from High Fidelity, Val Kilmer's buddy from Real Genius (Gabe Jarrett), even Clint Howard, Ron's brother, perhaps filmdom's uber-nerd.Nepotism is a good thing here. Not only does Clint have a good scene explaining to flight director Ed Harris that the moonshot is kaput and they will have their hands full just bringing the crew home, but their late mother Jean Speegle Howard shines as Jim Lovell's stroke-addled matriarch, delivering two of the film's best lines.I'm not crazy about Apollo 13, but I like it a lot, and I find myself liking it more the more I watch it. Ron Howard movies tend to push for maximum uplift, and the manipulation can be annoying, but here he seems to pull back on that while focusing on the human equation at the heart of the story. Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinese and especially Harris and Quinlan give excellent support for one of Hanks' best star vehicles, all the more a vehicle because Hanks serves the story rather than tries to make the story serve him.Hanks was inspired enough by this experience to do a series of critically-acclaimed mini-films documenting the Apollo program. You might be inspired enough to visit your local library, or do some Googling online. It's not `Gone With The Wind,' but as a history\/science lesson, `Apollo 13' is a damn fine piece of work.

I'm more of a foreign film buff but do enjoy old swashbucklers (like The Adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Zorro with Tyrone Power).  However, I dislike modern day versions of such great stories; they constantly take a far too modernistic and cynical approach to the times and attitudes surrounding the stories (look at how the last fourteen versions of The Three Musketeers have been made, from 1974 on) and cannot seem to accept that once upon a time, honor WAS more important than death.

But it just isn´t. The fault is not in the actors, they all do a great job, but it´s Cleese´s script that makes this such a disappointment to me. Many scenes that other critics have praised high, such as Cleese stripping, while the family comes in are hardly funny if you have seen at least one episode of Mr. Bean before this movie. Also Kevin Kline is too good as sadistic maniac Otto. If this was a Monty Python movie, Otto would be such an outragiously exaggerated character, that it would be at least a little bit funny. But Kline acts so naturally that you just hate the guy throughout the movie. It seems to me that the whole movie is made for American audiences rather than British, as the jokes are dumber and Kline and Cleese both mock the British culture all the time. It would´ve been fun to make the both mock each other´s cultures, but Cleese´s only comeback is the comment on Americans losing the Vietnam war. Sadly, a great scene, in which Cleese complains about Rambo, American football etc. was cut and even in the Special Edition DVD it´s a hidden extra.Very little in Cleese´s script is the same comic brilliance, good timing and as funny as his material in Monty Python and Fawlty Towers (Like the Dead Parrot sketch, Ministry of Silly Walks and the Towers episode Germans). There are some of those moments, however. Michael Palin´s animal-loving stutterer Ken almost saves the movie for me. The only part that made me laugh is Ken trying to murder the witness, but each time accidentally kills one of her dogs. It´s like a Road Runner cartoon came to life, when the second dog is squashed like a pancake and very, very funny.

Many scenes that other critics have praised high, such as Cleese stripping, while the family comes in are hardly funny if you have seen at least one episode of Mr. Bean before this movie. Also Kevin Kline is too good as sadistic maniac Otto. If this was a Monty Python movie, Otto would be such an outragiously exaggerated character, that it would be at least a little bit funny. But Kline acts so naturally that you just hate the guy throughout the movie. It seems to me that the whole movie is made for American audiences rather than British, as the jokes are dumber and Kline and Cleese both mock the British culture all the time. It would´ve been fun to make the both mock each other´s cultures, but Cleese´s only comeback is the comment on Americans losing the Vietnam war. Sadly, a great scene, in which Cleese complains about Rambo, American football etc. was cut and even in the Special Edition DVD it´s a hidden extra.Very little in Cleese´s script is the same comic brilliance, good timing and as funny as his material in Monty Python and Fawlty Towers (Like the Dead Parrot sketch, Ministry of Silly Walks and the Towers episode Germans).

American psycho was a very extreme and violent novel that was also infact due to its content the most 'controversial' piece of literature ever produced. But what the director has done, she has basically 'toned' down the graphic nature of the book and converted it into a materialistic and worldly psychopath killer The 80's Wall Street greed.On a personal note, American Psycho is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen! It is truly my favorite film of all time.Now, I know the name Psycho presents material violent in nature but director Mary Harron has portrayed this movie from the innermost feelings exposed directly from the main character being Patrick Bateman outstandingly played by actor Christian Bale.          (Who currently is working on a new `Batman' movie scheduled for release in the summer of 2005).Patrick Bateman is a complete definition of a perfect young upcoming urban professional, a.ka. `Yuppie'. He has all the characteristics of a human being but not a single clear identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust. All his friends and coworkers talk about is money and Donald Trump and although Patrick tries to embrace these money-oriented issues he simultaneously transforms himself into a sick repulsive madman.American Psycho teaches us that there can be a Patrick Bateman everywhere. He could be our neighbor, our colleague, a person we brush into while we walk into a supermarket or even a person at Kashmir Road! The fact that we cannot recognize a psychopath is that they easily blend into our society making us think that they are normal. I mean in the final chapters of the book author Bret Easton Ellis shows Patrick Bateman losing his sanity so badly that he resorts to drinking his own urine, sleeping under his futon and eating handfuls of sand on the beach while his fiancé manicures her nails.I wouldn't recommend this movie to people faint of heart or children. This movie is not about killing in any way. Its about how our society itself with all its glamour and greed can make a man transform into a complete sadist slaughterer. It's a movie which will be enjoyed by young people living in the Manhattan atmosphere at where this movie and book's plot is located.

With Mel Gibson, Milla Jovovich and Tim Roth--not to mention Bono penning the story--Million Dollar Hotel proves this point by delivering a harshly artistic film that will probably turn you off as many times as it inspires you.Using a mentally handicapped man to drive and narrate a story is always a gamble. The director risks alienating the viewers or even having the movie get on their nerves, and MDH does both in the span of its two hours. Luckily actor Jeremy Davies portrays the title role as an every man even with his apparent disabilities, making the viewer connect with him rather than feel sorry for him. The acting remains great right down the line with each player fitting right into their roles. Mel Gibson is actually perfect in MDH as he is kept in one emotion throughtout the film, not giving him a chance to overact.Jovovich too is great as always--only she can be so hauntingly romantic while playing a dirty, destitute and disturbed twenty something (the alliteration was not meant).The story itself is not unlike some of Bono's songs. While all the components are moody and depressing it is strangely uplifting overall. (The opening song, done by him, truly captures the movies tone as any titular piece should)One can tell pretty easily that director Wim Wenders was going for a specific feel throughout the film. With sepia toned shots and mystifying editing he fills the viewer witht he feelings of schizophrenia and disilussionment most its characters possess. The cinematography coupled with great lighting and interiors make the hotel in MDH truly feel more like a mad house than an apartment complex.There is a lot to be said in MDH about life, the human spirit and the human animal. The problem is that MDH says it to early and too often until the viewer grows tired of the point. Luckily the points are made so artfully as to almost forgive the writer and director for overkill. Sometimes directors get so wrapped up in their message that they forget the medium. Wenders is guilty of the opposite, making the film almost more artistic (and longer) than it needed to be.MDH is not exactly an easy film to watch, even if you have been weaned on films by men such as Paul Schrader or Christopher Nolan.

The ending is predictable and the dialog is unconvincing, despite the fact that the film was sloppy seconds the soundtrack was fairly well written and constructed, but even that couldn't save it.If you haven't seen this film I wouldn't recommend it.

I picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast. Where did I go right?As a screenwriter, one of my primary influences -- in terms of comedy --  has always been Mel Brooks. I was not familiar with his early work until recently, although I was familiar with their existence. As most viewers, I was introduced to Brooks through his comedy Spaceballs, bashed by critics upon its initial release in 1987 but followed by adamant fans to this day. And after watching Spaceballs on network TV for years on end, I finally got the chance to see his earlier works of comedy, which are much harder to find broadcast on television these days.Brooks is famous for his slapstick comedy, but I was astonished to find that The Producers is cleverer than anything else. This is Brooks' first mainstream film, and it remains one of his best.Perhaps the most flat-out ironic film of all time, Mel Brooks' The Producers (1968) is a film by a director who has not yet perfected the art of constant hysterical laughter, but a director who is at the peak of his 40-year + career in terms of scriptwriting. Brooks' later films, including Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Spaceballs, had more laughs but less irony and strong scriptwriting. In terms of plot and irony, and not actual laughs, The Producers is Brooks' finest achievement.Don't make a mistake sitting down to watch The Producers. This isn't the frequent, laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy that Mel Brooks' Spaceballs (1987) is. It isn't the clever spoof that Young Frankenstein was. But it is a very funny comedy, with great classic moments and some scenes so joyously outrageous; you just have to see them to believe them.Zero Mostel (credited during the end credits as simply Zero) plays Max Bialystock, a down-on-his-luck Broadway producer struggling to get by on his own terms. To survive, Max cheats old women out of money just to afford his apartment rent, offering them strange sexual games for payments. (The opening credits with Max and a band of old women are subtly suggestive and quite disturbing -- don't be put off by it.)Gene Wilder plays Leo Bloom, his worrywart accountant. After walking in on Max during one of his strange affairs, Leo checks Max's records and finds that Max earned $2,000 more than he earned on his last flop. And so the two hatch up a crazy plan that just might work -- over finance a total failure of a play, and keep the extra cash for themselves.And so begins their quest to find the absolute worst play of all time -- a play destined to bomb on Broadway. And they soon find Springtime for Hitler, written by a neo-Nazi playwright named Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), who prances about with German World War II attire and is frightened when Max and Leo approach him, afraid that they might be taking him away to jail. He starts to sing The National Anthem.Max and Leo find the absolute worst Broadway director, a homosexual transvestite (Christopher Hewitt), and assign him the task of handling the play. He loves it, and accepts the job, but first he addresses a problem. The Germans lose the war in the script. That's sad. He'll have to change the ending. Perfect, they think.The long-awaited scene, in which their travesty, Springtime for Hitler, is unleashed upon the public, is a bold movie even by today's standards --  only Mel Brooks and the Farrelly Brothers could ever get away with such an idea. Watching a band of Nazis form lines and dance about is gut-busting enough, but the sight of Hitler (Dick Shawn), a hippie with a moustache, is just outrageous.I think that part of the success of The Producers is the casting of its two leads, Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder. Mostel was a dramatic actor at the time, familiar with small roles on television and a few minor supporting roles. Here he is a bumbling, energetic fool, with such a sense of frenetic hyperactivity that his weight seems not to hinder his inner energy.Gene Wilder (who stole the show for me) was hardly a major star by this time, either. Leo Bloom, in The Producers was his breakthrough role, and he teamed up with Brooks for years to come. This is one of his finest performances, and the famous beginning sequence that introduces his problems with insecurity and hysterics is classic. (I'm hysterical! I'm having hysterics! Water is thrown on him. I'm hysterical and I'm wet! He is slapped. I'm in pain! I'm in pain, and I'm wet! And I'm still hysterical!)In regards to The Producers, Roger Ebert wrote, This is one of the funniest movies ever made. I can't say I agree. In terms of laugh-out-loud laughter, the film seems tame. It is dated. But while it may no longer be as raunchy or hysterical as it was in 1968, The Producers is certainly one of the most ironic and smartest comedies of all time, and for that it deserves extraordinary credit.5\/5 stars.- John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"31 December 2003","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Minor Spoilers Herein!How could this happen?

This movie is jaggedly uneven as well but it works.I thought Nicholson's acting was peculiar. He seemed real insincere and unnatural.

He is intended to give you a sense of instability and he succeeds very much so.Duvall is mousey and frequently irritating. She also seemed insincere.

The child actor was frequently - well, he seemed camera conscious and not very natural. Still, he provides many moments of unbalanced terror. I guess I can't complain. I watched the movie to get the creeps and this movie indeed gave me the creeps.The background music track is very effective in creating a sense of startlement without intruding on what is actually going on.

I have seen it at least twenty or thirty times and have found something new in it with each viewing.  Reiner, Guest, Shearer, and McKean did a phenomenal job writing and acting the movie.  The fact that the actors honed their musical skills to actually BE THE BAND and play and write all of the music speaks volumes for their commitment to this masterpiece.

The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnick. He is the slightly aloof ex-sportscaster who is the new reporter.

But I don't quite see what she finds so charming about her new colleague, Tom. It's something with them that prevents us from getting up close and personal with him.

Actually, for a while I thought he was Steve Guttenberg from Police Academy (1984). He has a few funny lines and if this was a Meg Ryan-picture, they'd call it a romantic comedy.Running over two hours, a few scenes could have been edited or left out completely, eg.

I was amazed at how funny this movie still IS.Although I've never found humor in flatulence, that scene is a classic; the bad guys all sitting around the campfire, eating beans and ripping loud ones while Taggart (Slim Pickens) attempts to contrive a new scheme for ridding them of the new Sheriff of Rock Ridge. Well, what about Mongo? I always felt uncomfortable with the use of racial slurs, and this movie made me uncomfortable in that way, but it was Mel Brooks's intent to make us uncomfortable with racism. You can't correct a problem until you drag it out and lay it on the table, which is precisely what he did. He left no stone unturned, and even took a few pot shots at himself in the process.This movie should have won about a hundred awards for its edge, wit, boldness, and the wonderful performances brought to the mix by these veteran actors. While Madeline Kahn did win a nomination for her portrayal as Lily von Shtupp, she should have won..and won..and won.That is my favorite scene in the entire movie.Gene Wilder is brilliant as the Deputy Spade. While he was a bit young to be cast as a washed-up gunslinger, he molds himself into the role very quickly and lends a strong endearing presence to his character. Endearing is a good word. It fits Clevon Little's character, as well. He was honorable, clever, and completely smooth as the Sheriff of Rock Ridge. I highly admired his performance, and still do.The dark humor in this movie is astounding. Brooks leaves no ethnic group unscathed by his cutting wit. There is no wonder this is the top grossing western attempt to be put on film. In the 1970's, when this was first released, America needed this form of release. There were serious racial tensions throughout the country, Watergate was still ringing in our ears, and the drama that was Patty Hurst's life for a time was still very much front page news. We, as a nation, needed a diversion which was not afraid of controversy and harsh reviews. The box office gross demonstrated just how much we DID need this movie, at the time it came out.For that; being there for us when we needed it most, many thousands, if not millions, are loyal to Brooks and his productions, regardless of the subject matter. The laughter and lightheartedness he gave to us lives on. I was so pleased to see this movie redistributed on DVD.Now, another generation can see and enjoy it as much as we did. Though they may not understand how we could laugh at a bunch of idiotic rednecks singing slave songs, using the N word every other line, and comparing anyone with any level of culture to a bunch of Kansas City fagots, hopefully, the humor will not be lost to the misunderstanding that these slurs were meant to be taken seriously. The intent was to LAUGH AT those ignorant rednecks for BEING ignorant rednecks.Long live Mel Brooks, the Crowned Prince of Parody!! It rates a 9.5\/10 from...the Fiend .

And when the skies began to open up, and Gretchen died, he knew that he couldn't let that jet engine miss him, or else everyone would suffer. So he found his way to time travel back 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds and saved the world by sacrificing himself. Donnie is a true hero, and anyone who misses that needs to open their minds. Wonderful movie. Besides, Jena Malone is pretty cute. And then there's Jake Gyllenhaal for the ladies, so who can argue with this movie?

Titanic isn't even in the same league as The Poseidon Adventure.  Titanic's acting is like an elementary school play compared to Gene Hackman and his castmates.  And unlike Titanic, with Poseidon Adventure, you actually root FOR the survivors.  I don't know anyone that wouldn't have preferred that Rose went down with the Titanic along with Jack.  The only thing Titanic beats Poseidon on is the special effects, and you certainly can't fault it for that.  For its time, The Poseidon Adventure stretched the limits of the technology far more that Titanic during its mid 90s shooting.  My only bad memories of The Poseidon Adventure, and this is not its fault, is its sequel.  Not only was Beyond... a horrible movie, but it ruins the first movie.  Suddenly rather than a huge disaster where only 6 people make it out alive, and only because they listened to Reverend Scott, we find that many more made it without his help.  It just doesn't have the same feeling after seeing the sequel.  (And why did the rescue team just leave after finding 6 survivors?  They couldn't stay awhile longer looking for more?)
