If you are a fan of the Evil Dead movies you will likely truly enjoy the third installment. Although it's not as gory and twisted as the previous Evil Dead (which was like being in the roller coaster after a few drinks) it's still damn entertaining. I would say it's a cool movie (although I don't like to use that word for description purposes).Well, the plot has nothing to do with Evil Dead II (except for the ending) but still brings the deadites now as an army, and demons as the main villains. This time Ash assumes 100% the role as a hero and confronts an Army Of Darkness. Ash also demonstrates he's not only a demon hunter, but also a brave man that risks his ticket home to battle the army and save thousands of people.The special effects are surprisingly good. It's believed that in order to make an epic movie you need a huge budget but Sam Raimi gives us a lesson with creative f\/x and wicked battle sequences. You don't need millions of dollars in order to create a great epic and AoD demonstrates it.Army Of Darkness is a sui generis Horror epic. Maybe I'm wrong but it's the only movie I can think of with such elements as medieval settings, battle sequences between demon armies, and a futuristic hero with a chainsaw. Thank you Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. If you miss demon possession from the previous movies, don't worry, there are a couple of scenes involving demons with the adequate make-up and that will please you. The movie is a must see for those who are into 90's essential Horror. Give the movie a chance and get into the great but unconventional script. You might enjoy it.

When I went to watch the movie, I didn't thought it would be a classic. But boy if I knew how bad it was\/is I wouldn't bothered to go in at all.Let's start from the actors. And if I didn't knew the actors I'd be wondering where they had found those people (maybe they dragged someone in from the street?). But there is an explanation Sam Neill & Co are humans too and they need the money. To pay bills and stuff. But even they must be ashamed of this. And they didn't even bother to act at all! Not that it would have elevated this movie to much better ranking place, but it might have been a little more pleasant to watch. Or at least they could have tried to have while shooting the movie, but even that wasn't possible (it seems that way if you watch the movie).But the actors are not the ones responsible for this mess. First of all you have to ask yourself if the scriptwriter had anything in mind except a cool idea! Because the outline did sound quite good. But when you have so much plot holes in a movie ... you just wish it is over. For the movie and the characters! You just don't care for people who act irrational and only just about compete who'll say the worst line in the movie. Irrational acting is something that you are used to in horror movies (most of the thrill will happen, just because of that behavior), but what happens here is just about every bad cliché thrown in. And mixed together, they don't taste any good, and they also smell bad too! But a bad script can be helped by a good director. If there was one here at hand ... If if if ... but there was none. Quite the contrary, this one (director was meant) isn't good, but he's bad! So he let all of the above happen and more. When people have a bad thing happening and then just jump out the next moment as if nothing happened, you're not only confused, but more than a bit angry. Mass delusion anyone?

And one things for sure, if I ever do something bad again, something real bad, I shall be punished with watching this movie along Kinetta ... But if you're a masochist, you can do that in your free time too ... I warned you! But if you don't want to waste your time, just don't watch this classic!

So, in the meantime, while figuring out what to do to save Fox, Walt Disney had seen Julie Andrews in the stage version of Camelot on Broadway and decided that she was his Mary Poppins and the rest is movie history. Back at Fox, looking through their unfilmed scripts they came across The sound of Music; so, William Wyler, the original director who was casting the film, asked Julie Andrews to play Maria Von Trapp, and she said, Of course! But what can you do with a Nun, a Captain, 7 children, and a bunch of Nuns? So, Wyler cast the film, but he preferred to do something else, and Robert Wise took over. Wyler stated that he knew that the film would be a hit, but he didn't think that it would be THAT big a hit! In the meantime, at the Acamady Awards, Julie Anderews, the original Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady wins the Oscar for best actress in Mary Popp;ins, and Rex Harrision, the original 'Enry 'Iggins, wins an Oscar for My Fair Lady, and Audrey Hepburn is overlooked for her excellent performance with too many excuses for why she didn't win! So, what made The Sound of Music such a hit? Good question! Not an easy answer! All the critics hated it; said it wouldn't last, but something happened, and not only did it last but became one of the great money makers of all time to the point that it played in reserved seat first run theaters for at least 3 years, and no movie had done that up to that time, but I think I have the answer It was just right timing. There was a lot of violence on the movie screen, no musicals, no good-feel movies to leave the theater with your toes tapping with a song in your heart!

So, when Julie Andrews won the Oscar for Mary Poppins she stated, I've heard that you Americans are known for your hospitality, but this is ridiculous! Next year when she was nominated for Soound of Music, the rumor is that the Acadamy was told not to vote for her because it was unheard of for an actress to win the years in running for a musical! So, be the powers of Hollywood in those days! And in case you aren't aware of this, Marni Nixon, who dubbed singing for Deborah Kerr in An Affair To Remember and The King and I, and who also dubbed partial-singing for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady can, for once, not only be heard, but can be seen as well singing for herself as Sister Sophia as one of the Nuns in the number How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? So, the cash flow saved 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy; but it took many years for the movie public to get over that their virginal Julie Andrews was human beings, and it too many years for Jack Warner to wipe the egg off his face for making such a boo-boo about the possibility of becoming a movie star, and Julie Anderews never, but never, worked on a film for Jack Warner! But, many have made the same mistake. There were those who said that Liza Minelli would never make it in the big-time because she was the daughter of Judy Garland! Boy!

The character of Enid is a solid representation of how clueless someone can be just for being on a certain age. And that is just normal. Through Enid's eyes we learn that this life is full of surprises and that no one has a pre determined destiny. Yes she loses important opportunities but she is loyal to her ideas. Her family situation is not the best but that doesn't affects her life that much. She has a best friend that always supports her. She seems to have a perfect life but it's just too difficult when you are in the process of becoming mature. The ending is satisfying because it leaves for your interpretation to wonder what will happen to Enid. Apparently, Rebecca, Seymor, and Enid's dad got what they wanted.

The story is tight, and the ending is just fantastic. I'm so glad Gilliam managed to win his battle against his producers. What they wanted would have destroyed the entire movie.Set design and effects are super. The retro feel of the movie is consistent and present throughout everything we see. For example, in every single room, there are ducts and cables running, even in the over-class mansions. It really helps that it's a British story too. There's no way America ever looked so gray and dull! The British improves the comedy a lot too. Take 1 standard American and 1 standard Brit and let them say something. The Brit is always funnier. The dialect, the hints of old imperialism, the manners. Brazil is no exception. Even De Niro manages to fake his accent convincingly.Acting is good overall, some characters are really bizarre and memorable. Jonathan Pryce is a good choice for the male lead, he's just outside mainstream but very talented. Kim Greist, the heroine, is a bit weak though. Maybe Gilliam isn't too skilled with female acting?

You have a cast that includes Spielberg's favorite actor, Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Paul Giamati, one of my personal favorites-Rolf Saxon in a non-speaking role. This film is mostly a male-dominated film with little or no romance. SPielberg's best asset is creating a spectacular image and this time, the landing on Normandy was not for the easily sickened.

Indeed the most common muttering that I heard among my friends with whom I was watching the film (who, I admit, had no idea what they were going to be watching and had never heard of the film) was what the f**k??!! I kept my incredulity to myself, but I largely shared their sentiment. It's a film about being John Malkovich (surprising, huh?). A man struggling to make ends meet as a puppeteer finds a job filing things on floor 7 ½ of a building which happens to be half a floor where everything is miniaturized, and all the people working there have to stoop. He discovers a small door that leads directly to the inside of John Malkovich, where you can be him for 15 minutes, after which you fall from the sky onto a spot pleasantly situated next to the New Jersey turnpike. Soon the puppeteer and a coworker (with whom he is in love, although he is married) start charging admission to regular schmoes who want to be someone else for fifteen minutes. A bizarre love triangle develops between the puppeteer, his wife, and the coworker, and somehow John Malkovich is worked in there as the puppeteer and his wife vie for time being him, so that they can then be with the coworker. Now before this plot gets any more convoluted and confusing to the unknowing reader, I'm going to forgo the growing plot and I'm going to jump to the meaning and the profundity of the film (which is actually the most fun part!).This film tackles one of the most existentially challenging and profoundly interesting and intense enigmas of humanity. What is the essence of self? Is it possible to see the world through someone else's eyes, and yet remain oneself? If you are someone else for a time, then what are you replacing, and what happens to that whom you've replaced? And what happens to your body if you've left yourself, to be someone else? Strangely enough, this film seems to answer all these questions, in as strange a manner as any other answer could possibly be. It puts forth a logical (well, almost) system in which one can be someone else, and it provides for any question the viewer could have about the process. It even raised a question that I had not even thought of, and answered it itself. What happens when a person is himself? That is, what happens when John Malkovich goes through the door to himself? Well, suffice it to say that the result blew my mind, and was hysterical at the same time. It was a very bizarre answer, but as good an answer as any other!This film is like nothing I've been exposed to before. I keep repeating at the ends of my reviews that if a film doesn't make you think, it's not worth your time. That still holds true for this film, perhaps even more than any other, but not like any other I've seen before. Other films have messages about life. They teach the viewer something about life, or some way to live, or something the director or writer has learned that he wants to impart unto the viewer. This film does that as well, and more. It does blatantly warn of the troubles involved with wanting to be someone else. The whole concept of being another person is simply impossible, and only a dream, as evidenced by the dream-like setting of the little door a floor half the normal size. However this film was more than a life lesson. It simply makes you think. And that's fun. It proposes a philosophical puzzle, and proposes a genuinely entertaining solution. However attacking a philosophical puzzle such as this one is seemingly impossible to do on film, short of showing three older men in smoking jackets amiably discussing the issue over sherry in front of a blazing fire. Therein lies evidence of the immense skill involved in making this film. Another remark that I heard from a friend as we watched the film was what kind of a person thinks of this stuff? The answer is a genius. Truly, only a person of extraordinary thought and inventiveness could imagine such a film. Furthermore, great film-making was employed as well. I still can't figure out how they filmed things through Malkovich's eyes. I suppose they could've taped a camera to his head. But that doesn't explain how Malkovich looked at himself in the mirror, with no place for a camera to hide. Regardless, it was pretty fancy camera work. In fact the camera work was quite masterful for much of the film, as things became mentally tumultuous.However the crowning jewel of this film, as I've mentioned before, is the writing both the story\/plot and the dialogue. The characters are so odd, the story so strange and the dialogue so out there, that one can't help but enjoy this film! It is meant to be a comedy, and it certainly is one. The oddness and awkwardness just make you laugh. I nearly forgot to mention the fascinating performances by all the actors in the film. Particularly the awkward puppeteer played masterfully by John Cusack, and his eccentric wife, played surprisingly well by Cameron Diaz. And how could I forget John Malkovich himself, who does an exemplary job playing himself, and playing&#133; well, himself, but possessed by another. This is really a fun movie to watch, to think about, and discuss. The makers, especially Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman, and the entire cast and crew deserve a firm pat on the back, and all those who haven't seen it deserve a firm word of encouragement.

But I have to say this first The audio track is really messed up. The dialog is recorded too soft and the sound effects and music are too loud. This frustrated my father with him perpetually resetting the volume on our TV set while trying to follow the speeches. The sound probably worked better in theaters, but for a home system it doesn't work well at all. I know the filmmakers probably didn't have a choice. I guess when I watch it again, I'll put the closed captioning on.So as not to repeat (or dispute) anything said by others up to now, a few thoughts of my own I saw The Cars That Ate Paris last year on cable, and I'm thinking of it now as a kind of prelude to Mad Max, if not an actual prequel. You see, in Cars you have a societal breakdown of the kind that could produce a world like Mad Max's. The same goes for Roger Corman's dark comedy Gas-s-s-s...but Cars That Ate Paris is a better match. Heck, in Cars you even have a similar story about a man wrestling with issues of conscience and madness in the face of psychological trauma, in addition to the vehicular violence.Perspective for the times...going into the end of the Seventies, you had Hal Needham's stunt spectacle movies like Smokey and the Bandit and Hooper in theaters...and I bet George Miller saw them and got ideas from them in making Mad Max. And then there was Corman and his multitude of biker gang movies and Death Race 2000.I'm not saying Miller wasn't an innovator...he certainly was. His use of camera angles in Mad Max is particularly striking. Mad Max didn't start a trend so much as it took existing trends, merged them, and threw them into a new direction that is still influential some 25 years later.One of the posters included in the DVD gallery called Mad Max The 'Easy Rider' of the Eighties...and that was a good description of its stature, at least. In my video collection, I have at least three Mad Max\/Road Warrior imitators that I can think of. I suppose the thinking of the age was if George Miller could do what he did with such a small budget, why not somebody else?

But I have to say this first The audio track is really messed up. The dialog is recorded too soft and the sound effects and music are too loud. This frustrated my father with him perpetually resetting the volume on our TV set while trying to follow the speeches. The sound probably worked better in theaters, but for a home system it doesn't work well at all. I know the filmmakers probably didn't have a choice.

You see, in Cars you have a societal breakdown of the kind that could produce a world like Mad Max's. The same goes for Roger Corman's dark comedy Gas-s-s-s...but Cars That Ate Paris is a better match. Heck, in Cars you even have a similar story about a man wrestling with issues of conscience and madness in the face of psychological trauma, in addition to the vehicular violence.Perspective for the times...going into the end of the Seventies, you had Hal Needham's stunt spectacle movies like Smokey and the Bandit and Hooper in theaters...and I bet George Miller saw them and got ideas from them in making Mad Max. And then there was Corman and his multitude of biker gang movies and Death Race 2000.I'm not saying Miller wasn't an innovator...he certainly was. His use of camera angles in Mad Max is particularly striking. Mad Max didn't start a trend so much as it took existing trends, merged them, and threw them into a new direction that is still influential some 25 years later.One of the posters included in the DVD gallery called Mad Max The 'Easy Rider' of the Eighties...and that was a good description of its stature, at least.

Looking back at this movie, I'm surprised that this was one of the box-office bombs for Summer 1993 and the year of 1993 in general.Everything was believable about this film. The acting was very convincing and the whole movie within a movie theme really works well for this film. The plot alone is what makes the film stand all by itself in an elite field of movies that contain a lot of shoot 'em ups and blow 'em ups. I still wonder why this film flopped. Maybe it wasn't the right summer to release it or people just didn't get it. Though it is far from being another Terminator 2(which is probably what people expected and wanted it to be) it is a good social commentary about the action movies that are made and the people that watch them.I will say one thing about the movie. However, the only bad thing about this movie is that it kind of lags behind during the second half of the movie and doesn't seem nearly as interesting as the first half. Other than that it's a well-thought out entertaining film. One day, if it hasn't already have, it will become a cult classic.

But why was this film even thought of. it made no sense and only had one link to the original and even that was at the end. In my opinion they should have completely rethought the whole movie and done it differently. the original was creative and actually made good watching. But like most people i believe that there are way too many companies churning out teen horror slasher films where a bunch of photogenic teens meet there maker who is some nut case in a costume. The best teen horror ever (in my opinion) is Final Destination because there is no masked killer only death so anyone thinking of getting urban legend 2, think again.

I think that also means that I would never go crazy over a film like this. Emma Thompson, who also adapted the novel to screen, plays Elinor Dashwood, the oldest sister and she represents sense. Kate Winslet plays Marianne Dashwood, the younger sister who represents sensibility. Their father has died and he must leave his fortune to the son of his first marriage. This causes complications between the family and the daughters' hopes of marriage.Elinor begins a relationship with a rich man, Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant). They are then separated because of Edward's wealthy family. Marianne, on the other hand, is in love with John Willoughby (Greg Wise). At the same time, wealthy Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman) has eyes for Marianne, but she thinks Brandon is too old for her and prefers Willoughby instead.The film sometimes has a few heartwarming and humorous moments, but overall I was quite bored of the film. The acting is pretty standard and the performances still deliver. Winslet's Marianne is who really shines in the cast. Director Ang Lee shows his versatility in her occupation perfectly &#150; the guy can make a good Taiwanese film, a British costume drama, a film based on American suburbia, a Chinese martial arts film, an action film and even a gay cowboy movie. The film is simply told, maybe being a little too long (never read the book) and might be great for fans, but I actually got bored while watching the film. The ending is predictable but yet wraps the story nicely.
