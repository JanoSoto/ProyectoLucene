No difference here, and also Meg Ryan, she is simply great with her natural acting. Its a real romantic comedy movie which entertains you a lot. In some point of the movie you feel angry towards Mr Fox(Tom Hanks) for making Kathleen(Meg Ryan) jobless by being a competitor in her business field. But the funny thing in this movie is that both are friends by chatting through the internet, but they doesn't know each other. And they are not revealing their personal identity through the net. But when Mr Fox realizes that his competitor is the one who is chatting with him through the net, then comes the real part of the movie. Still the heroine doesn't know that both the person are same. Meg Ryan will fall in love with the guy to whom she is chatting through internet. At last they will decided to meet. The story goes in flow were you can enjoy the feeling of love and the fun part as well. The plot of the story is simple but the acting of Meg and Tom Hanks makes it too interesting and entertaining. I have seen this movie more than tries. I recommend this movie to all of you who have not yet watched.

Tom Hanks was the perfect choice for this role he did it so much justice and just finished the film off. It is such an unusual role to play and is a hard type of role to fulfil but Tom Hanks was excellent at playing Forrest Gump. He managed to portray all of the emotions intended to the audience and really made you reflect on the events that are shown in the film. I would suggest everyone watching this film even if you have, watch it again. someone of any age would love this film whether you understand the connoted meanings or not.

Only problem is that this is not played out in some South American jungle, but in a Miami high school. This movie is about as much fun as a basket of dead bunnies. It is also so ridiculous that I have seen cartoons with more meaning. It's got an anti drug message all mixed up with Beringer's team looting the drug money to ( are you ready for this?) buy the underprivileged high school students electronic equipment and books. This is the point where I should have hit the stop eject button, but no I hung around for the final showdown where the high school is blown to smithereens. This is a movie to avoid, even for Tom Berenger fans. - MERK ","genre":null},{"date":"10 November 2013","score":"","review":" Tom Berenger leads a group of mercenaries with questionable motives, on a search and destroy mission.

He's mistaken for being in the world of the super wealthy when an upper crust man hires Tom to retrieve his wayward son Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) from Italy for $1000. He finds Dickie with his girlfriend Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow) and is lured into the world of the leisure class. When Dickie gets tired of Tom, Tom does the unthinkable and uses his underhanded skills to hang on.Director\/writer Anthony Minghella has instilled a sense of dread and foreboding. The acting is top notch with the most important coming from Matt Damon and Jude Law. There are honorable mentions to Philip Seymour Hoffman, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett. I do wish they play up Tom Ripley's homosexual side with Dickie and intensify the creepiness. Other than that, this movie has the perfect tone and sense of doom. It is such a perverse movie that you almost root for the conniving Tom Ripley.
