[{"date":"2 September 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Shrek is a fantastic movie with a great and really original storyline with a brilliant voice cast and some really lovable and unforgettable characters.The movie is easily one of the best family films ever made,there is plenty of jokes that will make the whole family laugh,and also plenty of subtle humor that only adults will understand,also the story isn't too dark for children or too childish for adults and there's a lot of not so subtle digs at Disney as well.Mike Myers,Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz all did a fantastic job and as much as I watch this movie and its sequels I never get tired of it,and Donkey is one of my all time favourite fictional characters.I would highly recommend Shrek to people of all ages,as a movie for the whole family,a comedy and just a beautiful animated film.When an ogre's swamp is invaded by fairy tale creatures,Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) must head on a quest with a talking donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) to save Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz) from the dragons castle so she can marry Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow) and get his privacy back in his swamp,but he gets more than he bargained for on this journey.
