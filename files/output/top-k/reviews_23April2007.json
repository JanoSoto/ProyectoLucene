It begins as she goes to a mental hospital in the countryside it looks and almost immediately our main character inexplicably stabs herself and gets thrown in a disturbed section as opposed to the initial summer camp section. It is here, where our story follows the rest of the film, a series of up and down spirals and looks at her interactions with the other patients.The thing about all of this is we never actually get to understand the characters at all. We are never told what they're about, why they feel this way, what their backgrounds are, and why they do what they what they do. They just are, and throughout the whole piece the audience feels like with any of the characters, it never surpasses the point of acquaintment because even, if the characters be developed, they were never characterized in the first place, so it's irrelevant. At the same time, though the movie certainly to its benefit explores the setting and situation in a very visceral way, by the movie's end, everything feels oversaturated, because it feels as though we have spent such time in this setting watching similar things with people that don't really mean much for so long that it just starts to wear thin. When the film end, we aren't really sure why the events have turned out as they did, because we aren't really sure why they were the other way in the first place. It just feels like a breath of fresh air to get a new sense of scenery.The thing is, though, despite that, the movie is still successful probably because the happenings themselves are rather interesting, the unflinching portrayal has the power to captivate, and there is claustrophobic intensity to the asylum as well as a general heterosexual male (being the viewer) to recessive female women appeal, which really adds a type of close-knit feel with the characters.So, it's not the most satisfying nor the most well-devised film of its genre out there, but if you be a fan of asylum films, this is definitely worth checking out. I also must note that out of all the mental hospital films out there, this is probably the most intense. This movie is 100% serious and very frightening and unsettling. There's no comedy nor light-heart in this movie. The tone is closer to a horror film (despite that it is a pure dramatic realism) than it is to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. From that perspective this film is actually very unique.

I was born too late to catch any of the preceding films in the cinema but thanks to play ground gossip and not-entirely-wholesome class mates I'd managed to catch all three on video in those heady few hours between getting home from school and the scramble to hide the boxes when my parents got in from work. Needless to say then, my hormone addled teenage self practically foamed at the mouth at the prospect of more alien carnage, especially when somebody mentioned they were bringing the guns back into the franchise. However, I was of course still too young to see it on the big screen and it wasn't until a plane flight back from Florida a year later that I finally caught Alien Resurrection in all it's glory. I whooped and hollered with delight and thought it was the most bad ass thing I'd ever seen. However, upon watching it again recently, all it really achieved was reminding me of the old me (which ironically was the young me) and how easily pleased I was. So I guess the whole point of this whimsical and nostalgic tale which has most likely caused the majority of you to skip to the next review down after clicking the not useful button is simply this; for gun crazy, early teenagers wanting gore, violence and acid bleeding monsters, this is a an absolute must once you've seen Aliens. For the slightly more seasoned film goer however, the ones who would have chosen The Third Man, The Seventh Seal, Cool Runnings or Citizen Kane on the flight instead, Alien Resurrection is ultimately unrewarding.Now, for all the plus points (Ron Pearlman!), the minus points (alien sex???) and the sitting on the fence points (is Distephano awesome or not? I can't tell), the principle reason for dismissing Alien Resurrection is this it's completely and utterly unnecessary. The original trilogy as I'm sure you're well aware runs in sequence quite beautifully. It moves from a haunting, slow paced opener, to a fast paced and action packed middle bit before climaxing in a grim, nihilistic opus of despair. Alien Resurrection doesn't fit the storyline at all, it feels tacked on, the last slow gasp of the horse as it gets beaten to death. And given that two hundred years after Alien 3, scientists are able to clone Ripley and the alien inside her makes the character's noble sacrifice at the close of the third act less heroic and more of a delaying action.Credit where credit's due though, it does have a very striking visual style. The influence of French director Jean Pierre Jeunet has carried over into the Gilliam-alike cinematography where everything is filmed with muddied, hazy colours and bizarre machinery waits round every corner. The appearance of the scientists in particular is pure nightmare fantasy; all shiny white suits that lead up to heads wearing quirky optic goggles and topped off with slick, greased back hair. The corridors of the ship meanwhile are dimly lit, endless octagonal constructs that fittingly enough, look like the inside of an alien's intestinal tract. Alien Resurrection may not be the high point of the franchise, but it sure as hell is the weirdest looking one. In fact, the best way to describe the whole thing would be as some kind of dark, science fiction carnival of the grotesque, with the 'grotesque' part ably supplied by a smattering of gore in which the human body is ruined in some incredibly inventive ways (at one point a man quite literally picks apart his own brain).Unfortunately though, imagery, gore and violence alone do not a good movie make. Unless it's 300. 300 was great. But I digress...At the forefront of the problem here is this new version of Ripley. I hate to pass judgement on an actress the calibre of Sigourney Weaver but it does seem as though her ego was left to run rampant on the film every step of the way. This carries over into her performance as well, with this version of Ripley remaining nothing more than an aloof, nonchalant presence to such an extent that even the emotional outpouring when she torches a clone lab feels altogether forced and unnatural. The Ripley of the previous movies was an impassioned and determined survivalist, this one is just sterile. This wouldn't be so bad if the rest of the cast could fill in the blanks but sadly, they're the most uninteresting bunch of xenomorph ready meals yet. There's none of the natural charisma or camaraderie of the marines or the inmates and with the exception of Dominique Pinon as an ass kicking, handicapped mechanic and Ron Pearlman as Ron Pearlman, they're very difficult to root for.By and large then, not a great film. It has its plus points but an uninteresting cast, silly concept and uninspiring heroine bring it down terribly and it's only real worth when compared to the rest of the series is as a catalogue of inventive deaths, best of which is undoubtedly the chestburster out the torso and through a man's head bit. It all reaches its zenith of course with the unveiling of the new monster, a human\/alien hybrid that resembles a New York sanitation commissioner who just had the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man detonate above his head.And Winona Ryder was rubbish.

I missed the Christmas feeling of the first two instalments in this summer set blockbuster and some of the characters of the first two films.However, on reviewing the first thing that hit me was the sad echoes of real life 9\/11 and one wonders if the film would ever have been given the green light now.That aside the film is very enjoyable as hungover John McClane and Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus, play witty duo, as they run around New York undertaking tasks set out by Simon played by heister Jeremy Irons.Die hard fans will find the icing on the cake is the direct link to the first film and for everyone else there's the banter between the leads and action scenes. The story is more complex than most action films and Irons bad guy has a little more depth than the usual villain. John McTiernan proves once again he knows how to direct and pace a film while Bruce does McClane blindfolded.

The one thing that really stops TLD from being a better film is the fact that it's just too tame. This was the last Bond film to be given a PG rating as it was clear that they couldn't appeal to the family audience any longer. With a new Bond should have come a new approach. Yes, it does feel more modern and realistic but since the script was originally designed for Moore they missed a chance at taking advantage of Bond's dark side. Thankfully, they did exactly that in Licence to Kill.Ian Fleming's story had Bond on a sniping mission, detailing every characteristic and moment of his assignment. Upon spotting the person he's been ordered to kill he discovers it's a beautiful woman and chooses to wound her instead of killing her. Wishing M to fire him for disobeying orders he comments that he must have 'scared the living daylights out of her'. The story ended on this note. The film expands this premise and has Bond escort a defecting Soviet agent from Russia only to disbelieve his story of a Russian General going berserk. Upon investigating further he discovers a plot involving the Mujhadeen and an American Arms dealer. Despite these complications and developments, there's just not enough killing! Without meaning to sound bloodthirsty, I just think that Bond should have laid waste to more bad guys. The script doesn't really give him a chance to. And, as a result, the film seems watered-down and too broad. Director John Glen stages and frames the action very well, as always but it's John Barry's score (his last involvement with the series) that gives it that extra punch. The Bond theme, so incredibly worn-out and done-to-death, is given a new spin, a faster tempo and more modern feel. Despite being about nine when I first saw it, this is the first thing I realized. They ruined a lot of potential by not taking this renewing further and not giving us a tougher film.Of Dalton's reign as 007, Licence to Kill is definitely the superior film, but don't rule-out Living Daylights. Average it may be, but still far from being anywhere near bad.

R.P. McMurphey is put in a mental hospital, where he must rebel against the evil establishment. A classic story of will versus the meanies. Essentially a tragicomedy, we get a film that works in both exposition and exploration of the mental hospital concept as it relates to the free-spirited protagonist, newly inserted as a patient, as well as the other patients, who are men, bought down by the woman. This is the stuff classics are made out of, though I do not think it's the definitive piece in the asylum genre. The film really doesn't operate on the same level that a lot of other piefces in that genre, do, focusing more on on stuff more about the soul than the psyche. I think that's what lends the film it's whole flavor, but if you be looking in the genre, this is satisfying in a different (more life-affirming way). I wouldn't call it a personal favorite, but I would call it superb work.It's also anti-psychiatry, like myself, and I gotta give it that. Comparing other mental hospital films to this is unfair, however. Besides the setting, I cannot recall a single mental hospital film out there with the guts to be like this film. This film totally is a different animal from something like say Girl, Interrupted or The Snake Pit or many other films which have bits like that. The film is about the affirmation of the human spirit against a seething institution. I'd say that this movie has more in common with prison movies.

Well, I must say that Key Largo was a better song and a better movie. Although I was interested in the characters, and my love for Mickey Rooney allowed me to look past his cartoon stereotype of the Japanese-American, I couldn't help but feel a certain amount of revulsion and pity for these people. This was Days of Wine and Roses without the truth. Paul and Holly are alcoholic prostitutes (this is no spoiler as it's revealed very early in the movie). It's very sad that they have to cling to one another, but their only other option is to keep performing sexual favors (although Holly's are only hinted at) for their paying customers. Holly has gone through several relationships and is very willing to marry for money. Paul would rather sleep with Patricia Neal than sit down and write (although, I probably would too). Neither one has an honest moral and find the act of petty theft to be charming and entertaining. Basically they are hooligans. If they weren't so darned attractive (and if Moon River wasn't playing in the background) this would be a precursor to a movie like Barfly.I do have to admit I'm glad I finally saw the movie, rather than wondering what all the talk was about. And I'm glad to have seen Fred Flintstone himself in the role of Sally Tomato (I'm going to have to look him up and see what else he's lent his face to). However I found this breakfast lovely to look at, but it left a gritty taste in my mouth.

No WAY! Bogie had been perfect, Dick Powell, nearly as good, but M.A.S.H.'s 'Trapper John'? Too ethnic, too 'hip', too 'Altman'! Well, seeing it again, nearly 34 years later, I now realize I was totally wrong! The film is brilliant, a carefully-crafted color Noir, with Gould truly remarkable as a man of morals in a period (the 1970s) lacking morality. Perhaps it isn't Raymond Chandler, but I don't think he'd have minded Altman's 'spin', at all! In the first sequence of the film, Marlowe's cat wakes him to be fed; out of cat food, the detective drives to an all-night grocery, only to discover the cat's favorite brand is out of stock, so he attempts to fool the cat, emptying another brand into an empty can of 'her' food. The cat isn't fooled by the deception, however, and runs away, for good...A simple scene, one I thought was simply Altman quirkiness, in '73...but, in fact, it neatly foreshadows the major theme of the film betrayal by a friend, and the price. As events unfold, Marlowe would uncover treachery, a multitude of lies, and self-serving, amoral characters attempting to 'fool' him...with his resolution decisive, abrupt, and totally unexpected! The casting is first-rate. Elliott Gould, Altman's only choice as Marlowe, actually works extremely well, BECAUSE he is against 'type'. Mumbling, bemused, a cigarette eternally between his lips, he gives the detective a blue-collar integrity that plays beautifully off the snobbish Malibu 'suspects'. And what an array of characters they are! From a grandiosely 'over-the-top' alcoholic writer (Sterling Hayden, in a role intended for Dan Blocker, who passed away, before filming began), to his sophisticated, long-suffering wife (Nina Van Pallandt), to a thuggish Jewish gangster attempting to be genteel (Mark Rydell), to a smug health guru (Henry Gibson), to Marlowe's cocky childhood buddy (Jim Bouton)...everyone has an agenda, and the detective must plow through all the deception, to uncover the truth.There are a couple of notable cameos; Arnold Schwarzenegger, in only his second film, displays his massive physique, as a silent, mustached henchman; and David Carradine plays a philosophical cell mate, after Marlowe 'cracks wise' to the cops.The film was a failure when released; Altman blamed poor marketing, with the studio promoting it as a 'traditional' detective flick, and audiences (including me) expecting a Bogart-like Marlowe. Time has, however, allowed the movie to succeed on it's own merits, and it is, today, considered a classic.So please give the film a second look...You may discover a new favorite, in an old film!
