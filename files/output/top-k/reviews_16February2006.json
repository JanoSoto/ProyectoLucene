I put on the TV and all the scenes reminded me off the best movie ever made in Europe, and the best on the subject...La Haine The first time I saw the movie in 2003, we was gonna watch it for school. At first I thought it was gonna be another french movie about a young french girl that got pregnant(we watched a lot of those in French lessons)...but what followed was probably the most defining 90 minutes in my life.When the movie started with the images of riots (real riots, old news footage) combined with Bob Marley's Burning and Looting I was getting fascinated about this movie, this had to be good. A lot of things were very recognizable, everyone knows a Said, everyone knows a Hubert and at the time I was feeling like Vinz. All the scenes influenced me and were very recognizable, the hanging around with friends, the way of talking, the arguments they used for their deeds...everything. The end shocked me and I couldn't really think anything else then I got to watch this movie again, and the day after I bought a DVD of it.The movie tells the story of a black, Arab and Jewish guy who live in a housing project near Paris, the kind of neighborhood where most of the people don't have a job, where the youth bores itself and flirts with criminal behavior, where drugs are being sold and where an occasional riot starts (this happened from the 80's until recently from time to time). The movie follows them 24 hours after their friend Adbel got beat up by the police during the riots, where a cop lost his gun. Vinz (the Jewish guy) found the gun and swears that when Abdel dies he's gonna take vengeance by killing a police. With Vinz - not being the most stable nor the most smart and relaxed person - having a gun on him the three come in some hard situations, but also without the police gun they have enough problems during the 24 hours....I ain't gonna spoil anything, but this should be enough to make you wanting to watch this movie.After watching it a couple of times I realized that this was a story, I always thought it was a documentary, which is a big compliment to the whole crew I think. But still that didn't made the movie less strong, the greatest thing about it is that it isn't easy made, no clich√©s...when you watch an American movie on the subject there always is some form of exit for the main character or he dies in a way that makes you think he deserves it. So either way a character is portrayed as a nice guy or a total bad guy, who both have girl who want to get them out of troubles. This is where La Haine sets itself apart from other movies, it doesn't try to portray the characters as nice people, although you do feel sympathies for them. The best thing is the end, which sets the movie mostly apart and makes it more recognizable for the European crowd (I'm not gonna spoil it, but if it ended differently the movie wouldn't been so great) The way it is shot in black and white makes it look realer, makes it grimier, it portrays the banlieues as a place without an exit. That's what maybe sets the movie also apart, the black and white makes it look arty and grimy at the same time. Maybe the best is that it still doesn't look dated because of that.Another great thing is the soundtrack, all the songs that are used in the movie have a great effect on the images and visa versa. Bob Marley perfectly fits the riots, Isaac Hayes fits the hashish packing and smoking scenes, Zapp and Roger fits the break dance song perfectly and the Expression Direct fits the haunted car scene in inner city Paris perfect (if you can understand the lyrics). But what really sets this movie apart is the Cutkiller scene, this scene only made me wanted to get a set of SL1200's...The way the tension is build in the movie is great, most of the time the characters don't do anything, but you still feel the tension building, the hate growing, and when you maybe bored watching some scenes the first time (the candit-camera scene for instance and the eiffeltower scene), but afterwards they're like pieces of a puzzle falling into it's place. Some shots are brilliantly, the Taxi Driver imitation of Vinz at the beginning (when you already see that Vinz is losing it), the police interview shot with Said and Hubert, the discussion at the toilets, the way the characters are introduced, the subway shot...it's all eye candy.To make a conclusion, if you love hip hop and don't think the police as necessarily the representation of the good in society. of course when you love cinema it is also a good movie, but it really is a movie which has it own public the youth. If your Dutch try to get hold of the 7 euro Freerecord shop version, but I can recommend the English 10 year anniversary more...the directors commentary, trailers and bonus material make this a really nice DVD. But I can understand why a lot of people don't like it, it doesn't offer solutions, it doesn't give an opinion on anything except the police, and of course you have to have a certain frame of mind to like the movie.

Mixed views on the film have and continue to surface. Some love it for its focus put back towards the horror genre. Others find it disappointing by seeing it as a movie that doesn't do anything new with the series as they see it as a bit of throwback to Alien. Judging from the stars I'm sure you can figure out which camp I'm in.Let me be clear on one thing though, if you really want to get the best experience out of Alien 3 watch the special edition. While I enjoyed the theatrical release it was just so easy to tell how people didn't like it, as it's the more boring version. The special edition of Alien 3 actually catches your attention and gets you interested in the outcome of the movie. So if you didn't like Alien 3 and are reading my review thinking I'm just another person liking it because it's an Alien film watch the special edition yourself, you'll see why so many love it.Alien 3 takes place on Florina 161, a planet with an unstable atmosphere. Because of the harsh conditions on Florina 161, the few inhabitants have to stay underground most of the time. They also have to keep their heads shaved due to a lice outbreak on the planet. Ripley's ship crash-lands on this planet and she finds herself among the prisoner inhabitants of Florina 161, who are made up of rapists, serial killers and psychopaths. Conflicts brew upon Ripley's arrival and the arrival of a new, faster and more agile alien.So, why is Alien 3 such a great film you ask? Well, even though it's not an original twist to the franchise after the first Alien film, I'm actually glad that it's not an action film. While was the real trump card of Aliens, it was mostly because it was a different take for the movies. Alien 3 goes for a grittier and more suspenseful take compared to the in-your-face action and it works surprisingly well. While Alien 3 won't scare it'll still have you interested in what happens throughout the film till the end.As a master of suspenseful and thematic thrillers, David Fincher's touch to the gritty and dirty tone for Alien 3 shows very nicely. I'll also admit for a movie that didn't have a script when production began, the plot and flow of the movie goes very smoothly. One thing that might surprise you in Alien 3 is that it actually has a sense of humor even though it's a pretty serious and religious film. While the movie won't make you do much more than chuckle a bit in these areas it does help the film escape some moments that may seem a bit too serious.Alien 3 also has some strong performances to help the movie flow better. Weaver is once again Ripley but even after getting her head shaved you can still easily tell it's her. You've also got actors playing the prisoners of Florina 161 that help to compliment the serious tone. The viewer will even start to grow a connection with these deranged serial killers because of the situation they are in with the alien hunting them down. This effect works very well and makes Alien 3 arguably as good as Aliens, if not better.Against what seems like impossible odds towards being a good movie, Alien 3 actually comes out as a great movie. Every time I watch Alien 3 I love it even more than before, and the ending (which should've really ended the series) remains as touching as ever. If David Fincher is reading this then he must know that he has nothing to be ashamed of in this movie, it's excellent!

It hardly won any awards even though the acting is top-class in this movie, as well as the story itself is.Basically this movie is the ultimate guy-movie. Violence, shootouts, cursing, cool characters, all put together in a clever script that is filled with some typical Tarantino dialog and situations. How could you not love this movie? It has some highly memorable sequences in it, mainly thanks to the great cast and acting.The cast of this movie is absolutely amazing. Lot's of well known actors show up in some rather small roles such as Christopher Walken who with his one scene makes such a lasting impression, that you easily forget that he only is in the movie for a few minutes. Same goes for Gary Oldman in a totally flipped role and Samuel L. Jackson who basically only is in for about a minute or so. Other impressive small roles are being played by James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore (crazy as always), Michael Rapaport, Victor Argo, Brad Pitt as a hilarious stoner, Ed Lauter, Dennis Hopper, Saul Rubinek, Val Kilmer and Bronson Pinchot. The two main leads, Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette might not be as impressive as the rest of the cast but the supporting cast more than compensates for this.But it really are Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken who steal the show in this movie. Gary Oldman is totally crazy over-the-top as a white pimp who acts- and thinks that he is a black person. The famous sequences between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken is a true classic and one of the best acted sequences I have ever seen. Those 10 minutes alone are more than enough to make this movie worth watching. It's such a well written and acted out sequence. It never loses it's power, no matter how often you have already seen it. I think I already know that dialog by heart right now.It's a great story of romance, drugs, stealing and killing. The movie is made very lighthearted, meaning that it's incredible fun to watch. The movie is obviously not made serious, just look at the over-the-top characters and dialog.

It has some highly memorable sequences in it, mainly thanks to the great cast and acting.The cast of this movie is absolutely amazing. Lot's of well known actors show up in some rather small roles such as Christopher Walken who with his one scene makes such a lasting impression, that you easily forget that he only is in the movie for a few minutes. Same goes for Gary Oldman in a totally flipped role and Samuel L. Jackson who basically only is in for about a minute or so. Other impressive small roles are being played by James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore (crazy as always), Michael Rapaport, Victor Argo, Brad Pitt as a hilarious stoner, Ed Lauter, Dennis Hopper, Saul Rubinek, Val Kilmer and Bronson Pinchot. The two main leads, Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette might not be as impressive as the rest of the cast but the supporting cast more than compensates for this.But it really are Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken who steal the show in this movie. Gary Oldman is totally crazy over-the-top as a white pimp who acts- and thinks that he is a black person. The famous sequences between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken is a true classic and one of the best acted sequences I have ever seen. Those 10 minutes alone are more than enough to make this movie worth watching. It's such a well written and acted out sequence. It never loses it's power, no matter how often you have already seen it. I think I already know that dialog by heart right now.It's a great story of romance, drugs, stealing and killing. The movie is made very lighthearted, meaning that it's incredible fun to watch. The movie is obviously not made serious, just look at the over-the-top characters and dialog.

Nicholson plays a man by the name of Robert Dupea who is coming back to his hometown to see his dying father. When we first see Dupea (Nicholson) we see him as a man who goes from job to job and the same goes for woman. He likes to drink and you could almost consider him of some sort of drifter. We see him in the beginning where he is working in an oil field where the job was more of physical work than intellectual work, but we get the impression that Bobby wants it that way something completely different than his past. When he wasn't doing that he was either playing cards or with his somewhat girlfriend Rayette (Karen Black). Though he lies to her flirts with girls in front of her face and even sleeps with other woman, yet for some reason Rayette is holding on hoping that someday Bobby will say that he loves her.When he comes back to see his father we see that Dupea had a much different previous life back home, where he was a very accomplished musician as a pianist. We get to see a very humorous part of Nicholson in this movie when his friend Elton () and him are suppose to be driving to work and they end up by getting stuck in the traffic jam. Dupea gets so fed up with all the honking and yelling that he climbs out of the truck and starts screaming and yelling back but obviously was not going the results he wanted. He then sees a piano in the back of a truck and gets into the back of it and plays the piano in front of everyone in the crowded streets.

Cheech, the son of a Los Angeles Police Officer, was born in 1946 L.A., during his education he graduated at the California State University Northridge. Tommy Chong was born in 1938 Canada, before entering into his Chong Persona; he was a songwriter and guitar player for the Motown Label. By the mid 1980's he became an American citizen, even to the extent, in September 2003, of serving nine months in a State Prison, for distributing drug paraphernalia. It seemed he was made an example, as others were only given just fines and some ordered with Home Detentions. Up In Smoke is a highly funny movie, with Cheech Marin playing the poor Latin American and with Tommy Chong, as the Upper Middle Class self-inflicted drug addict. The plot is simple, one druggie meets, by accident, a Latin American, it is the antics of both as they search for a score of Grass. In the mean time, both get a job of transporting a van from over the Mexican border to the USA, which is made completely out of marijuana. Their inability to realise this, as they continue still, to try to score, is what makes this an observation of blind stupidity and dazed intelligence, if there were any to begin with. Were these guys intelligent before their little vice became habit? I doubt it.The third main character in Up In Smoke is played by Stacy Keach, as Sgt. Stedenko, the incompetent and highly-strung Narcotics Officer, waiting for his big break. With great contempt for the Law, Up In Smoke does its very best, and succeeds, to ridicule and embarrass the Authorities. Being a movie targeted for the Underground Drug Culture, Up In Smoke was bound to have a certain success. This movie, if it were to make it Mainstream, would only be by word of mouth. As someone who heard about this movie by word of mouth, and expecting a basic losers and work-shy layabout druggies movie, this turned out to be something more, something fantastically funny and so over the top, that it makes Up In Smoke open to all audiences. You may have watched the movie, but it does not mean you have to play the part. Up In Smoke is a movie to warn us all, in the usual inept way that is the Cheech and Chong style, as to why they call it dope.

Then it pops up on TV and becomes a favorite with a lot of viewers.I managed to not even notice the 2000 release of The Replacements - it came and went that quickly. But I did catch it on cable recently and found that while it does follow the usual clich√©s of sports\/comedy movies - inspirational coach, washed up player becomes the hero, romantic sub-plot - it has some very very funny moments, and overall, is an extremely enjoyable film. I've talked to other people who have all said, Oh yeah, I loved that movie, really funny. I won't rehash plot and details - there's too many other reviews that have done that already. What makes this movie fun to watch are the truly goofy, off the wall scenes that you don't find in other sports movies - loved the jailhouse line dancing scene - the memorable characters and their interaction with each other, and the bone crunching game sequences. The comic characters don't seem cartooney, like they did in Major League. They play off each other and seem like slightly broader versions of real people. The out-of-shape chain-smoking Scotsman with the kicking leg of steel, the sumo wrestler, the ex-con, the cop with anger issues, the butterfingered comedian - they are goofy and hilarious, but at the same time completely believable.Keanu Reeves' stoic face and delivery works to great effect here - he is a guy who has repressed a lot of fear and humiliation, but responds to the looseness and friendship of his teammates. Gene Hackman, who of course is always great, plays it perfectly.

But I did catch it on cable recently and found that while it does follow the usual clich√©s of sports\/comedy movies - inspirational coach, washed up player becomes the hero, romantic sub-plot - it has some very very funny moments, and overall, is an extremely enjoyable film. I've talked to other people who have all said, Oh yeah, I loved that movie, really funny. I won't rehash plot and details - there's too many other reviews that have done that already. What makes this movie fun to watch are the truly goofy, off the wall scenes that you don't find in other sports movies - loved the jailhouse line dancing scene - the memorable characters and their interaction with each other, and the bone crunching game sequences. The comic characters don't seem cartooney, like they did in Major League. They play off each other and seem like slightly broader versions of real people. The out-of-shape chain-smoking Scotsman with the kicking leg of steel, the sumo wrestler, the ex-con, the cop with anger issues, the butterfingered comedian - they are goofy and hilarious, but at the same time completely believable.Keanu Reeves' stoic face and delivery works to great effect here - he is a guy who has repressed a lot of fear and humiliation, but responds to the looseness and friendship of his teammates.

It is about community and social order enforced to those who crave to be something different. It's something more too. It's about expectations of what people have on their lives and how those expectations are not born freely, but from need be in line and need to merge to society. Actually that is perfectly clear when Vinny struggles with his wife. In the end you are not sure is Vinny really in love with her or is he driven by obsession of having decent marriage and so on. He struggles between what he have learned to be right and where his desires drive him and in between he is unable to take responsibility for his actions. And this is why there's so much sex. Where else in life's spectrum people's expectations and reality is as sensitive as in area of sexuality. In this sense the most sincere relationship in the movie is between Richie and Ruby. Richie don't want to engage to sex just because it's expected. He's perception of sex seems to be that it's completely corrupt and in no circumstances sex could be truly gentle way of expressing desire and love. But in the end Ruby make him believe otherwise. Before that sex have only been a way of getting money to get away for Richie and he leaves his real self outside of it. Thus his relationship to Ruby is the most gentle and honest one found in movie.Some have said that there's no explanation of why Berkovizc did the killings. There certainly are not so much said about his personal reasons, but lot are said about society's ways of enforcing social order and thus using violence as a meaning to maintain that order. And this is what this movie is about. So why whine about if it ain't something different. Are people really so occupied by their expectations that they can't listen what storyteller have to say and can't open their eyes to see the obvious. Or are movie watching not driven by curiosity for life, but fulfilling expected mantra? Many of the comments seems to suggest, like some characters say in the film, while speaking about Richie, that Lee have gone out of line with this film, which I find quite revealing. I have seen suggestions that characters in movie are so dysfunctional that they would have deserved to end up as victims of Berkovizc. Any hint what kind of mentality perhaps was driving Berkovizc? It is obvious in the Richie beaten-scene that gang who beats him is disappointed as they are interrupted. They don't care about murderer, but want Richie down cause he is different. In the end murderer is closer to those gang members than any of the strange guys they are listing as potential killers.Thirdly I see this film as a comment to our ways to glorifie violence in media and so on. It is in question of violence serious, but in representing violence it is also ironic. Powerful end sequence, where star of the show ( Berkovizc ) is coming to police station and Who's music is used, is crucial. It have almost revolutionary fewer in it, but in the same time Who sings welcome the new boss, same as the old boss. And it is cut to the beating of Richie, the one who is too different and don't care about respecting the rules that others follow and worry about. Movie seems to suggest that society doesn't change and individuals end up to suffer from same sort of burden of expectations which makes those trying something different it's enemies. Berkovizc is portrayed making killings, cause dog order him and it is not coincidence that in the end-scene Berkovizc character looks to police dog and smiles. It suggest that same sort of despise drives society to punish it's members than drived Berkovizc to killings. Smile suggests that he welcome's his punishment, perhaps even craves for it. Remember how real Berkovizc have tried to integrate back to society and get acceptance by turning Christian. So Berkovizc is product of the society and it's pressures. I also see whole speaking dog thing making irony of how people don't take responsibility of their actions, but look for excuses. So speaking dog-scene, ridiculed by some here, is well motivated and actually what else it could be than farcical. Perhaps it is too challenging, as a way of telling story, for some viewers. But this only makes Lee even more courageous. Hub of the life stems from diving to uncertain, not from obeying the expectations. And Lee is explorer of that uncertain, at the same challenging viewers to be ones. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, some haven't been up to this challenge.It's not the individuals who destroy themselves, but the order that people have built for themselves.

It's a long way from most of their roles. Mantegna is especially impressive with his comedy. I was shocked how funny he was.The only criticism I had, other than totally preposterous story being a little too far-fetched, is that one scene (at the construction site) went on too long. The movie as a whole would have been better had it been cut about 15 minutes.

Raging Bull is Jake LaMotta's rise and fall as an athlete to a nightclub performer. I think this is the film that Joe Pesci shows that even little guys can cause the most harm. When DeNiro and Pesci play the La Motta brothers, you believe it because they have such great chemistry with each other. I don't think Pesci was ever intimidated by Scorsese or DeNiro. This film earned DeNiro his second Academy Award and you can see why. Not only is the transformation, physical but emotional and psychological as well. These characters are flawed, human, and believable with great cast of actors. Don't forget Cathy Moriarty who was discovered to play Jake's young second wife. Even at 18, she can play younger and older and believable. His second wife can be beautiful and smart but trapped in a fractured marriage. She deserved her Academy Award Nomination for Best SUpporting Actress because she can handle herself against DeNiro and we see how he fell in love with her. Don't forget Pesci's wife is played Theresa Saldana who does hold her own. This film shows that black and white can still be beautiful film work. Nicholas Colasanto from Cheers is also in the film as well in a small role. Scorsese's best films are with DeNiro and Pesci at least in my opinion. At the end of the film, I wanted to know more about these characters.

Although I am in the distinct minority, I didn't particularly like KAGEMUSHA. Yes, it was big and beautiful and had great scope but it was also emotionally sterile and bore little resemblance to Kurosawa's earlier, more famous works. The same, by the way, can be said about RAN. Both films had relatively HUGE budgets but the dialog and connectedness between the characters was lacking. As a result, I felt pretty bored when I watched both of them--especially this film. So, if you compare these two movies with THE 7 SAMURAI or YOJIMBO, for example, they seem VERY different. These older films, though not filmed in color, had a greater sense of humanity about them--great importance was placed on the INTERRELATIONSHIPS between the characters AND the camera work was very different, with more closeups and a more intimate feel. So, while RAN and KAGEMUSHA were pretty to look at, I felt much more detached from them and cared much less about the characters. I really think the problem with these two movies, and the reason I like them less than the average Kurosawa film, was that the big budget in these later films actually HURT them, as too much emphasis was placed on effects and dialog was purely secondary.So, in summary, I am the odd-ball that didn't love this film. You will probably disagree and might be tempted to mark my review as not helpful, as the reviews on IMDb are generally glowing. But having seen many Japanese films, I can't help but feel there are better films out there waiting to be seen. Most any other Kurosawa film, and films by other great directors (such as THE SAMURAI TRILOGY, the films of Yasujiro Ozu) are more appealing to me. I think the popularity of this film is in part due to its having been seen in theaters by more Westerners than any other of Kurosawa's films--SEEK OUT HIS EARLIER AND MID-CAREER FILMS--they are better and far more emotionally involving.
