Whoa! (I thought). What's happening dude? It seems I was watching a film called The Matrix starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and the very toothsome Carrie-Anne Moss. Apparently human experience is just a Virtual Reality created by weird AI beings to lull us into compliance and enable them to harvest us for our bio-energetic essence. I thought everyone knew that by now? Well, apparently not according to this film.In fact there are many, many things that this film believes the audience does not know. For a start it believes we do not know that AI machines will take over the world because we are so stupid. It believes that we know nothing about the history of Western philosophy and even less about Eastern philosophy. It is not aware of the fact that most of us have spent hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hours in our lives discussing the nature of reality both sober and (more frequently) drunk and that we are intimately familiar with all the arguments involved. The film does not know that we can recognise a cliché-ridden script when we hear one. (Sample My way or the highway. Someone is pulling our virtual legs here surely?)This film does not know how restless a modern audience can get waiting for the action to start nor has it ever heard of the Lizard's First Law of the Cinema i.e. First make your film then cut at least thirty minutes out of it because it is just annoying dreck that has been put in to pad out the film because all film directors are too chicken to make films that run 90 minutes these days, pal! Suddenly I hear Keanu's voice in my mind &#x96; I know Kung Fu! I find myself in a sparse Japanese Hall. Keanu makes several hypnotic gestures culminating in a flick of the wrist beckoning me to fight him if I dare. I realise that he is imitating Bruce Lee's postures and damn me he nearly succeeds. I step swiftly aside and Laurence Fishburne steps in to take my place. Even though my Real Life mind knows Keanu and Larry don't know anything about Kung Fu, my VR mind believes they are old hands at it. As a long time fan of HK Action films I find this sequence absolutely exhilarating. What Keanu and Larry lack in terms of authenticity is easily hidden by the choreography, editing and special effects.Then, in the blink of an eye, I'm cowering behind a pillar as a dozen men and one woman with an armoury of guns blast hell out of the marble-clad walls, floors and ceilings of a huge office lobby. Remarkably a thousand wall tiles die for every person killed but in due course and in suitable John Woo style, the good guys win only to go on to the next action-packed scene.Taking the action scenes and the effects alone this is one of the best films I have seen for some time. When they really let rip with the guns, bullets, machines, kung-fu and upside-down, sideways and backwards balletics I felt a real adrenaline rush of joy of the kind denied to all those po-faced critics in the broadsheets who have to seek meaning and purpose and socially responsible messages in modern films.But then suddenly I was back in plotland with all the lack of logicality you'd expect from one of the worse technobabble episodes of the least good Star Trek franchise show scrapped from the bottom of the barrel when they are running out of money and ideas at the end of a long run. Bought back down to reality with a bang.Forget the plot. Go for the action and the effects. And one more thing &#x96; Existenz has this film beat hands down.

Jackie Brown is braced by the feds who are after SLJ just when SLJ decides he wants his entire half million stash bringing out of Mexico. Thrown into the mix are Robert De Niro as a very dim sidekick to SLJ, Bridget Fonda as one of SLJ's girlfriends and Robert Forster as a bail bondsman who falls for Grier. The scene is then set for a complex plot in which you are never entirely sure who is going to double-cross whom right up to the very last few scenes of the film.This is a very conventional film in many ways. It is heavily plot-driven in a way that sustains tension throughout. The characters are given plenty of opportunity to develop and to surprise the audience. There are laughs and a few in-jokes. The camera movements are, for the most part, very constrained and the use of close-ups is extensive. Only twice does Tarantino do anything out of the ordinary; once where he uses a short split-screen sequence and once where he shows the same scene three times from three different perspectives. But you feel that this is not the director showing off but sensible decision taking about how the plot can best be served. The violence is nearly all off screen and the only thing your maiden aunt could object to is the language. And what language it is. It seems like Tarantino has a perfect ear for putting just exactly the words you would expect into his character's mouths. We all know no one is as fluent, as funny or as dumb in real life but, whilst we are in the cinema, we believe that real people could speak this way. It seems like there are acres and acres of dialogue in Tarantino's films but they are all worth hearing.At the heart of the film though is Pam Grier as Jackie Brown. It's not as if she comes over as being a great actress but she does come across as being a real woman. She's got a serious choice to make if she is ever going to get out of being a flight attendant and she is streetwise enough to be plausible as the woman who will risk it all to rip off the half million and still win your sympathy. She is also in her forties, big by comparison with what is fashionable, and more gorgeous than any teen or twenties stick-insect actress that you could ever mention. Clearly, either Tarantino or the cameraperson, or both, are deeply in love with Pam Grier as is evidenced by the many long and lingering shots of her. Some of these shots go on for so long that there can be no reason to hold them for the sake of advancing the film. They are simply there to let us look at her and read every nuance in her face. If you don't like her face then some of this film will leave you cold. And this leads to my only criticism of the film in that it could comfortably be 20 to 30 minutes shorter &#x96; not necessarily cutting the shots of Pam Grier but elsewhere where things run on just a shade too long.

I say this because it was quite obvious that whoever wrote this film obviously had one goal in mind and that was to present a political opinion that pandered to a certain audience without regard to actual reality. But bending reality completely out of shape has been a trend for a long time in Hollywood and since it sells tickets I imagine it will continue for some time to come. That said, I suppose I shouldn't argue with success regardless of how silly the story gets. At any rate, Demi Moore plays Navy Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill who has applied for SEAL training but has been turned down. She laments that because some of her male counterparts have succeeded that they are being promoted ahead of her. Apparently there are no other tough courses in the entire Navy for her to excel. Fortunately, as luck would have it Senator Lillian DeHaven (Anne Bancroft) also laments the fact that women aren't given equal opportunities in the Navy and so Lt. Jordan O'Neill suddenly has her big chance. Quite naturally, she not only survives the course (which has many men falling by the wayside due to the physical and mental strain) but she also becomes the leader of her squad due solely to her will to succeed. Not only that, but she is so extraordinary that we see her helping men through the obstacle course along with rejecting all gender norms as well. Naturally, towards the end of the film she even manages to save her instructor Master Chief John James Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen) while on assignment in Libya. Again, only in Hollywood. Now, normally I would rate a film as ridiculous as this the worst possible score. But it does have some good action scenes and I like Demi Moore. But even so, unless you really need some laughs, totally enjoy feminist propaganda or are completely naive, I wouldn't bother with this one.

There is Peter Fonda, young, thoughtful, soulful. There is Dennis Hopper, young, thoughtless, self indulgent. And Jack Nicholson with hair and a Southern accent, carrying on some phantasmic monologue about Venutians mating with humans. Fonda explains to Nicholson why smoking dope is better than getting drunk. How do you do it? Don't it lead to the hard stuff? I don't want to get hooked. There are discussions about the meaning of freedom and a kaleidoscopic vision of an acid trip. Much of it seems so terribly earnest and yet we know by now that just about everyone involved in the production -- Dennis Hopper in particular -- was more or less stoned throughout.And, all of that dated material aside, the movie still packs a wallop. I found a few scenes a little slow. (That exalted commune with the naive youths scattering seeds in the dusty earth; you'd have to be a joiner to agree with Fonda that, They'll make it.) It's common knowledge now that Fonda, Hopper, and Nicholson don't make it to Florida. They're bumped off by rednecks, after being refused service in a café. It seems hard for us to go that far back in time and understand the symbolic significance of the Hippies' life style. What an awful thing a little bit of extra hair was. It's hard to believe. But I was refused service and insulted in a Texas café a few years earlier because one of the two guys I was traveling with had a neatly trimmed beard.

As Judge Learned Hand put it, A society in which men recognize no check on their freedom soon becomes a society where freedom is the possession of only a savage few.

And something similar happened later because the girl I was with wore a sweatshirt with the name of a Northern university on it.The year this was shot, 1968, represented the height of Flower Power. Like all social movement embracing freedom, it didn't last long. It turned violent. As Judge Learned Hand put it, A society in which men recognize no check on their freedom soon becomes a society where freedom is the possession of only a savage few. But those were the 60s, the most anti-nomian decade in recent history. It's ironic that most of the cries for more freedom now come from those parts of social space in which the most constricted and rule-bound Americans are found. It seems at times that the freedom they demand is the freedom to compel everyone else to live the way they themselves do.In any case, let me get down off this soap box. My nose is beginning to bleed from the altitude. All that dated stuff aside, it's worth catching again. It's a farragonous chronicle of the times, okay, but it's sweet too. All that innocence, all that belief, all the beauty of that landscape of the earth and the mind, laid bare on the screen -- and in color.

On one hand, it does what it's supposed to do which is look into the life of the story's main character. On the other hand, I felt that something about this story was missing and I ended up really wanting much more than what I got. No one else but Daniel Day-Lewis could have successfully pulled off the role of a disabled Irishman who can only move with his left foot and yet become an inspiring artist. The way that he disappears into his character and convinces us that he has these physical and mental struggles is nothing short of expertly done. Daniel Day-Lewis isn't the only cast member of this picture that delivers impressive acting, Brenda Fricker is also exceptional as his mother who tries her best to figure out how to take care of her son. Fiona Shaw is also pretty decent as a doctor who forms a special bond with the main character. These three performances are basically the best aspect of this film. Despite that praise, I feel that the storytelling and screenplay for this film is very much a double edged sword. Like I stated earlier, while the storytelling is very efficient and keeps moving along, I could make the argument that it moves a little too fast. What I mean by that statement is that I felt there were parts of the story that felt incomplete in my mind. For example, the main character has a relationship with this one woman in the chronological end of this story given that the story's told through flashbacks. We only see this certain character for about 10 minutes at most and we are given no reason why she's necessary to the plot. In addition to this, while I felt that we got to knew the Day-Lewis character okay enough, I knew little to nothing about everyone else to the point where I forgot about them.

I remember being slightly intrigued by the prospect of a (very) dark comedy about a young boy's dramatic life and loss of innocence, but it still stayed on my to-watch-list for a very long time. The simple fact is that this film seems to be largely forgotten and ignored, which, as I discovered when I finally watched it, is a real shame. It's the story of Francie, a boy with a depressed mother and alcoholic father, who escapes to fantasy worlds to deal with the real one. One by one the things that are keeping him somewhat sane are taken from him and as they are, he lashes out ever more drastically and violently. All this is set to the background of the Cuban missile crisis, which also enters the story in the last act. What sets the film apart from other such efforts are two things amazing actors, especially newcomer Eamonn Owens, who plays Francie, that manage to make the story come alive, and a tenderness in the telling of the horrific tale that makes it both bearable to watch and yet drives home the horrible situation even more. This film is not for everyone and there are also many flaws, but it managed to draw me in and fascinate me as few films have done before. If you can manage to get your hands on it, I highly recommend it.

Knowing this, is knowing everything else including the seduction is her exploring by allowing herself to be explored. The gaffe with the bottle of wine sent by horny soldiers to the wrong table, the ugly ducklings instead of the pretty blonde. But it makes its way to the right one, and we have the two soldiers go after the two girls (but not the blondie), and that subplot abandoned with inviting glances.Now her seduction (remember, still a story she will tell) but we actually skip sex, and go straight to the intimacy and youthful joking around on the bed which is what she yearns for, connection. And as she leaves the room, she meets the ugly duckling coming back to her room after her parallel night with the soldier.The lecturing by a teacher on girls guarding a woman's honor, and she boards the first bus out of there.

The ugly duckling as the blonde. It can support all that and more, excellent, excellent stuff.In order to appreciate why this is special, watch another Czech film called Daisies (Sedmikrásky), more inventive on the surface, more irreverent on the same subject, but it doesn't hit deep. It has the images but not the life that gives rise to them, there are both here, and how.It's so good, it rivals Celine and Julie Go Boating on my list of great films, a similar film on the layered dreaming of a girl.

But only half of it is there, the rest you'll have to supply which is even better in a way. Films come into being after all in that space between what is there and the experience in the eye.But first. Watch it once straight through because it's funny as hell in that gentle way the Czech know so well, just light and bitter enough to be like getting tipsy on life, delighted at the tipsiness. It's well made and well acted, you can see why Milos Forman was quickly tapped by Hollywood.Watching it once, you'll have this as your template&#x97;a teenage girl's impressionable drift through male sexual whims, and bittersweet realization in the end of heartbreak every time. Now bring all these other things to itThe guys are only looking to get laid, this isn't about them.It's a story the blonde girl tells to her girlfriend using the photograph of a boy, both real and imagined. Knowing this, is knowing everything else including the seduction is her exploring by allowing herself to be explored. The gaffe with the bottle of wine sent by horny soldiers to the wrong table, the ugly ducklings instead of the pretty blonde. But it makes its way to the right one, and we have the two soldiers go after the two girls (but not the blondie), and that subplot abandoned with inviting glances.Now her seduction (remember, still a story she will tell) but we actually skip sex, and go straight to the intimacy and youthful joking around on the bed which is what she yearns for, connection. And as she leaves the room, she meets the ugly duckling coming back to her room after her parallel night with the soldier.The lecturing by a teacher on girls guarding a woman's honor, and she boards the first bus out of there. Is she mad? Looking for answers?The cut from her alone in a country road boarding the bus, to a dance floor in the city filled with young couples, to TV footage of dancing girls in the parents' home. Amazing storytelling, because it is not of the story but the air around the girl lifting her from that road to wait for him in his house.Her being 'locked' in the house, falling asleep to the mother's incessant nagging. Waking up again, now the boy is there but he's not who she would like him to be&#x97;she watches heartbroken through a peephole (a cinematic device) as the pettiness of family life is revealed.So this is wonderful.

Even action movies I'm not a fan of, boring is not the word I'd use to describe them. With this film, it's a strange scenario; I guess I have a low tolerance for films that feature gigantic, fire-breathing dragons and loud, listless characters shouting in thick, often incomprehensible British accents.The story begins with a young boy named Quinn, who is on-location, admiring the constructing of the London Underground where his mother works. During the construction, the workers awake a gigantic dragon from its hibernation and pay the lethal price of getting incinerated. Quinn and his mother try to escape via loading elevator, but the dragon kills the mother when he flies out of the building, leaving poor Quinn alone. Now it's ten years later, in 2020, and Quinn (Christian Bale) is leading a group of people, who have been forced to leave everything and barricade themselves inside a large castle in Northumberland. London, and possibly the rest of the world, has become taken over and destroyed by large dragons. Quinn has his survivalist group under control, until Americans Denton Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey) and Alex Jensen (Izabella Scorupco) arrive to fight back the beasts, leaving him at a quandary. All of his men and women want the same goal, but they want to achieve it through ways of power, leadership, and integrity.This little detail alone certainly could've posed a great power struggle between the men, but the film is so repetitive, bleak, tonally obnoxious, and uninteresting that one doesn't even seem to mind the lame direction the film takes. This is what you define as lazy disaster filmmaking; mix two separate time periods, throw in robotic characters, neglect all parts of humanity and depth, and market it to those who want to see dragons and nothing more.Not to mention, isn't it odd how Hollywood can find the most ridiculous things to exploit but there has been a stunning absence of dragon films in the last few decades? Reign of Fire gets points for having a few unique and somewhat interesting instances like where the fire-breathing behemoth leader (?) of them all swoops down and breathes a fire big enough to burn an entire city. Scenes like that have the tendency to leave a viewer with optimism for the remainder of the film, until they realize that it has nothing much else to offer other than repetitive action sequences, a large amount of incomprehensible shouting, and redundant character quibbles on top of convenient melodrama.If there's one saving grace to this film, other than having one solid scene every thirty minutes, it's the music, done by Edward Shearmur, who prior to this scored the wonderful Kevin Spacey drama K-PAX, beautifully and subtly. Sure, these are two different films, but Shearmur puts in a surprising amount of tension and craft behind the music in this film. When what's on screen fails me, I then employ secondary senses to pick up what ordinary viewers might not even think twice about.Reign of Fire features two early performances of Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey, both men who started out their careers a tad rocky, yet went on to find different little performances they could work extremely well in. Living in the present, it's sad that it was just around eleven years ago they were giving ho-hum performances in a forgettable actioneer when they would both become recognized for their achievements in difficult, but rewarding roles.

NO) to the&#x85; well, not the end&#x85;the latest, I've noticed a lot of patterns in the franchise. For example, I see FROM Russia WITH LOVE as the last real spy film in the series for almost four decades. Seeing as how this was only the second movie in a series that has now survived fifty years, it obviously wasn't a trend that continued long at all. FROM Russia WITH LOVE was the last Bond movie for many years that felt like actual espionage in action. Code phrases, secret meetings, assassins, and basic gadgets no more complicated than a briefcase with secret compartments. The series wouldn't return to this serious edge until the Dalton films in the late '80s and then the Craig movies in the '00s. There is little to no campiness in the movie and it handles itself almost totally seriously, which I find more engaging in a good Bond movie. The movie begins soon after the events of DR. NO. SPECTRE wants 007's blood for disrupting their Jamaica operation and killing their operative, Dr. No. The head of their organization puts his top people into forming a revenge plan. James Bond is to be lured to Turkey under the guise of a Russian operative's defection. Bond is to meet with the woman, Tatiana Romanova, and bring her to England with promises of a Russian Lektor decoder. Meanwhile, SPECTRE will be guiding Bond into their trap on the Orient Express where they plan to murder 007 and escape with the Lektor themselves.The second movie has been touted by many as one of the best in the 007 franchise. I disagree, but it's not for lack of trying. As I mentioned above, I really enjoy this movie for being a solid espionage thriller with real suspense without resorting to craziness to keep the audience's attention. It's very low key and grounded, and I love it for that. My problem is that the movie is a bit of a drag for most of the running time. From the moment that Bond arrives in Turkey until he finally arrives at the Orient Express, the movie crawls a little too slowly for me. The entire sequence when the mission takes a detour for Bond's mission contact in Turkey (Pedro Armendáriz in his final role) brings him to a gypsy camp for&#x85; something that wasn't made quite clear enough to me. It feels unnecessary to the story with the exception of giving the Russians' assassin another chance at killing 007. Bond doesn't even meet with Tatiana until a good portion of the movie has passed and, by then, you just want to get to the part when SPECTRE springs their trap. Once the movie finally hits the Orient Express, it's everything I want the movie to be. Suspenseful and topped with a brutal fight when Bond finally confronts the man who has been stalking from the very moment he arrived in Turkey, the assassin Red Grant.Speaking of Grant, the man is one of the most imposing villains Bond has faced in the history of the franchise. His threatening presence is made all the more frightening at the fact that we don't hear him speak until more than an hour and a half into the film and, even then, it's as the SPECTRE plan comes to a head. He is played to perfection by Robert Shaw and I can understand why so many lists include Grant as one of the best Bond villains ever. FROM Russia WITH LOVE is a film of many Bond firsts. In addition to the first great villain, the film also boasts the first pre-title sequence in the series in which James Bond is assassinated&#x85; sort of. It was a great way to grab the audiences attention and it set the standard for every movie that followed. FROM Russia WITH LOVE also introduces Desmond Llewelyn as Q for the first time. The character, named Major Boothroyd, actually appeared in DR. NO but had been played by Peter Burton. Llewelyn, a 007 movie staple, would go on to play Q until he passed the reins to John Cleese in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH in 1999. This movie was director Terrence Young's final venture into the world of 007 and he set the standard for great quality in Bond's missions.

James Bond is to be lured to Turkey under the guise of a Russian operative's defection. Bond is to meet with the woman, Tatiana Romanova, and bring her to England with promises of a Russian Lektor decoder. Meanwhile, SPECTRE will be guiding Bond into their trap on the Orient Express where they plan to murder 007 and escape with the Lektor themselves.The second movie has been touted by many as one of the best in the 007 franchise. I disagree, but it's not for lack of trying. As I mentioned above, I really enjoy this movie for being a solid espionage thriller with real suspense without resorting to craziness to keep the audience's attention. It's very low key and grounded, and I love it for that. My problem is that the movie is a bit of a drag for most of the running time. From the moment that Bond arrives in Turkey until he finally arrives at the Orient Express, the movie crawls a little too slowly for me. The entire sequence when the mission takes a detour for Bond's mission contact in Turkey (Pedro Armendáriz in his final role) brings him to a gypsy camp for&#x85; something that wasn't made quite clear enough to me. It feels unnecessary to the story with the exception of giving the Russians' assassin another chance at killing 007. Bond doesn't even meet with Tatiana until a good portion of the movie has passed and, by then, you just want to get to the part when SPECTRE springs their trap. Once the movie finally hits the Orient Express, it's everything I want the movie to be. Suspenseful and topped with a brutal fight when Bond finally confronts the man who has been stalking from the very moment he arrived in Turkey, the assassin Red Grant.Speaking of Grant, the man is one of the most imposing villains Bond has faced in the history of the franchise. His threatening presence is made all the more frightening at the fact that we don't hear him speak until more than an hour and a half into the film and, even then, it's as the SPECTRE plan comes to a head. He is played to perfection by Robert Shaw and I can understand why so many lists include Grant as one of the best Bond villains ever. FROM Russia WITH LOVE is a film of many Bond firsts. In addition to the first great villain, the film also boasts the first pre-title sequence in the series in which James Bond is assassinated&#x85; sort of. It was a great way to grab the audiences attention and it set the standard for every movie that followed. FROM Russia WITH LOVE also introduces Desmond Llewelyn as Q for the first time. The character, named Major Boothroyd, actually appeared in DR. NO but had been played by Peter Burton. Llewelyn, a 007 movie staple, would go on to play Q until he passed the reins to John Cleese in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH in 1999. This movie was director Terrence Young's final venture into the world of 007 and he set the standard for great quality in Bond's missions. FROM Russia WITH LOVE is one of the stronger films in the 007 canon and, even if it didn't live up to the hype when I finally watched it, it stands as one of the best quality films in the series.

Along the way he gets involved with his ex-wife (Faye Dunaway) who left him and the kid years earlier and he also can't escape his destructive nature. The original version of this story was quite good and of course it contained the now famous ending, which is pretty much kept here. Look, there's no question that the final five-minutes here are incredibly powerful but they still can't make up for the previous 116-minutes that are pretty manipulative and flat. There are all sorts of problems with THE CHAMP and while it's certainly not a bad movie it just doesn't have what it takes to overcome all the flaws. One major flaw is the screenplay. You can give the producers credit for not delivering a scene-for-scene remake but the new stuff they added simply doesn't work. This includes all the time spent with the horses as well as the relationship between Voight and Dunaway that constantly builds up. I really didn't care for their early conflicts and I certainly didn't care for the directions their relationship goes through towards the end. It's almost as if the filmmakers threw in a bit of KRAMER VS. KRAMER (which was released the same year) to try and sell a romance side. Another thing that doesn't work is some of the casting. Voight is one of my favorite actors and he delivers a good performance here but I think he was miscast. I think he's simply too smart and this comes across so the destructive nature of this character just doesn't suit him.

Schroder, on the other hand, clearly steals the film with his touching performance and he's certainly a knockout at the end. We get some terrific character actors in supporting roles including Jack Warden, Strother Martin, Arthur Hiller and Elisha Cook. Joan Blondell, in one of her final films, has a small part as well. Again, the ending is what this movie is known for and it's a great one.

I'll tell you why I was interested. Monster horror movies such as Alien are just amazing and so I was excited for this.

The music was great but to me, not as frightening or anywhere near as iconic as the Halloween theme. The story was as I said...just an awesome premise for a horror. The writing and directing were great. The movie falls a bit in terms of suspense as I found the movie very suspense-less and very not so scary The effects have certainly been outdated but that isn't a flaw considering the movie came out 30 years ago.

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"24 February 2013","score":"","review":" The Return Of The Living Dead is one of the best Horror and Zombie films ever made,a brilliant Horror film that mixes Horror,Comedy,Zombies and great special effects and soundtrack. All those combinations make The Return Of The Living Dead not only one of my favorite Horror and Zombie films,but one of my favorite films of all time and one of the great Horror Classics of the 1980s and of all time.Based on the novel of the same name by John Russo and set in Louisville,Kentucky,The Return Of The Living Dead tells the story of a young man named Freddy(Thom Matthews)who has just started his first day working at Uneeda Medical Supply Warehouse,working for his bosses Burt(Clu Gulager)and Frank(James Karen). While showing Freddy the ropes Frank tells Freddy that the Warehouse has Army tanks that contain zombies down in the basement. When Freddy and Frank look at the tanks,the two accidentally release a toxic gas that raises the dead from the grave. Meanwhile,Freddy's friends are waiting for Freddy and looking to party,but unfortunately Freddy,Frank,Burt and Freddy's friends have to deal with dead zombies want human brains and also want to party.One of the many reasons that The Return Of The Living Dead is Horror classic is because the film reinvented the zombie genre. Instead of making another zombie film where the zombies are walking slowly and dumb,the zombies in this film are smart,fast and talk. The zombies can get you anywhere and anytime in the film are the characters are not safe,you can run and run,but the zombies still catch up to you in heavy numbers. ROTLD also gives the zombies a different target for their eating,not flesh,but human brains. In someways ROTLD reverses the idea of killing zombies by hitting the brain instead this time the zombies are eating and killing humans by eating their brains and the zombies are just addicted to it. While many say 28 Days Later(which is a great movie as well)started the idea of fast Zombies,ROTLD did first and in ROTLD and deserves credit. ROTLD also succeeds as a great Horror-Comedy,because mixing the two great genres is never easy. I think the reason the Horror and Comedy works so well in ROTLD is because of the bizarre and over the top situations and the way the characters act and react to the things going on in the film whether it's dealing with the zombies or with each other and the situations are handled with Black Comedy and gore. The dialog and interactions between the characters add to the Comedy in the film and while it feels real,it's also over the top and insane. The Comedy works because the actors play the scenes straight forward and sometimes serious so that the film doesn't become a Spoof or Parody. While the film is a Black Comedy,the movie never forgets it's a Horror film and the film is very scary and filled with creepy atmosphere and keeps you on the edge of your seat with dread and well-placed scares,because like I said in this film no character in the film is safe. The characters in the film are likable and well-developed and when things go bad you definitely feel sorry for them and their reactions while at times over the top feel real and not forced or fake. The teenage characters and adult characters aren't Slasher film victims where you are waiting and hoping the characters to get killed off,but sympathetic enough to root for and are hoping for their survival. The violence and gore in the film are well-done and suit the film and while this film isn't as bloody or gory as other great zombie films like the Night Of The Living Dead,(which the characters make reference to)Dawn Of The Dead,Day Of The Dead or Re-Animator,(both of the latter films came out the same year in 1985)the film can be pretty bloody and gory at times. The ending of the film is great because it's unexpected,funny and adds to the film's greatness because it's tragic,bleak and darkly humorous and it's one of the reasons ROTLD is a classic.The cast does a great job in their roles. Clu Gulager is great as Burt,a man who takes charge and kicks zombie butt. Don Calfa is wonderful as Ernie,an embalmer who tries to help out Burt. James Karen and Thom Matthews are hilarious as Frank and Freddy and have great chemistry together. Miguel Nunez Jr. is great as Spider who's smart,tough and can handle himself. Linnea Quigley is wonderful and sexy as Trash,a girl who loves sex and death. Quigley's nude scene or scenes is one of the film's highlights. This film is one of the reasons Quigley became a scream queen and B-movie queen. Beverly Randolph does a fine job as Tina,Freddy's scared girlfriend. John Philbin and Jewel Shepard are wonderful as Chuck and Casey. Mark Venturini is funny as Suicide an angry punk. Brian Peck(Scuz),Jonathan Terry(Colonel Glover)and Cathleen Cordell(Colonel's wife)give good performances as well.The direction by Writer-Director Dan O'Bannon is excellent with O'Bannon using great angles,close-ups and bringing a great pace and energy to the film and does well in the scary scenes. Great direction,O'Bannon.The score by Matt Clifford is effective and creepy and matches the tone of the film. A well-done and memorable score. The film also has great songs on the soundtrack like The Trioxin Theme(Frances Haines),Nothing For You(T.S.O.L.),Dead Beat Dance(The Damned),Surfin'Dead(The Cramps),Tonight(We'll Make Love Until We Die)(SSQ),Partytime(45 Grave),Take A Walk(Tall Boys),Burn The Flames(Rory Erickson),Eyes Without A Face(The Flesh Eaters)and Love Under Will(The Jet Jack Berries). An awesome soundtrack that mixes Punk and Pop.The special make-up effects in the film are well-done and realistic and hold up really well.In final word,if you love Horror films,Comedies or Zombie films,I highly suggest you see The Return Of The Living Dead a true Horror classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 February 2013","score":"","review":" The Return Of The Living Dead is one of the best Horror and Zombie films ever made,a brilliant Horror film that mixes Horror,Comedy,Zombies and great special effects and soundtrack. All those combinations make The Return Of The Living Dead not only one of my favorite Horror and Zombie films,but one of my favorite films of all time and one of the great Horror Classics of the 1980s and of all time.Based on the novel of the same name by John Russo and set in Louisville,Kentucky,The Return Of The Living Dead tells the story of a young man named Freddy(Thom Matthews)who has just started his first day working at Uneeda Medical Supply Warehouse,working for his bosses Burt(Clu Gulager)and Frank(James Karen). While showing Freddy the ropes Frank tells Freddy that the Warehouse has Army tanks that contain zombies down in the basement. When Freddy and Frank look at the tanks,the two accidentally release a toxic gas that raises the dead from the grave. Meanwhile,Freddy's friends are waiting for Freddy and looking to party,but unfortunately Freddy,Frank,Burt and Freddy's friends have to deal with dead zombies want human brains and also want to party.One of the many reasons that The Return Of The Living Dead is Horror classic is because the film reinvented the zombie genre. Instead of making another zombie film where the zombies are walking slowly and dumb,the zombies in this film are smart,fast and talk. The zombies can get you anywhere and anytime in the film are the characters are not safe,you can run and run,but the zombies still catch up to you in heavy numbers. ROTLD also gives the zombies a different target for their eating,not flesh,but human brains. In someways ROTLD reverses the idea of killing zombies by hitting the brain instead this time the zombies are eating and killing humans by eating their brains and the zombies are just addicted to it. While many say 28 Days Later(which is a great movie as well)started the idea of fast Zombies,ROTLD did first and in ROTLD and deserves credit. ROTLD also succeeds as a great Horror-Comedy,because mixing the two great genres is never easy. I think the reason the Horror and Comedy works so well in ROTLD is because of the bizarre and over the top situations and the way the characters act and react to the things going on in the film whether it's dealing with the zombies or with each other and the situations are handled with Black Comedy and gore. The dialog and interactions between the characters add to the Comedy in the film and while it feels real,it's also over the top and insane. The Comedy works because the actors play the scenes straight forward and sometimes serious so that the film doesn't become a Spoof or Parody. While the film is a Black Comedy,the movie never forgets it's a Horror film and the film is very scary and filled with creepy atmosphere and keeps you on the edge of your seat with dread and well-placed scares,because like I said in this film no character in the film is safe. The characters in the film are likable and well-developed and when things go bad you definitely feel sorry for them and their reactions while at times over the top feel real and not forced or fake. The teenage characters and adult characters aren't Slasher film victims where you are waiting and hoping the characters to get killed off,but sympathetic enough to root for and are hoping for their survival. The violence and gore in the film are well-done and suit the film and while this film isn't as bloody or gory as other great zombie films like the Night Of The Living Dead,(which the characters make reference to)Dawn Of The Dead,Day Of The Dead or Re-Animator,(both of the latter films came out the same year in 1985)the film can be pretty bloody and gory at times. The ending of the film is great because it's unexpected,funny and adds to the film's greatness because it's tragic,bleak and darkly humorous and it's one of the reasons ROTLD is a classic.The cast does a great job in their roles. Clu Gulager is great as Burt,a man who takes charge and kicks zombie butt. Don Calfa is wonderful as Ernie,an embalmer who tries to help out Burt. James Karen and Thom Matthews are hilarious as Frank and Freddy and have great chemistry together. Miguel Nunez Jr. is great as Spider who's smart,tough and can handle himself. Linnea Quigley is wonderful and sexy as Trash,a girl who loves sex and death. Quigley's nude scene or scenes is one of the film's highlights. This film is one of the reasons Quigley became a scream queen and B-movie queen. Beverly Randolph does a fine job as Tina,Freddy's scared girlfriend. John Philbin and Jewel Shepard are wonderful as Chuck and Casey. Mark Venturini is funny as Suicide an angry punk.

It stars Robert Cummings, Priscilla Lane, Otto Kruger, Alan Baxter, and Norman Lloyd. One thing about this movie is that it has some striking similarities to The 39 Steps (1935) and North By Northwest (1959). A man who is falsely accused of something is chased across the country with a climax that takes place on a national monument. This movie has some humor in it, but overall it is darker than North By Northwest. It can be classified as a World War II propaganda movie and clocks in at 1 hour, 49 minutes. Hitchcock recycled a lot of his movie themes and plots over the years, and basically I see this movie as a trailblazer for the superior North By Northwest, although Saboteur is a good movie, no doubt. I really like this movie's black and white cinematography and overall atmosphere, particularly the scenes at night. You never know what you'll encounter when you're traveling across the country at night. Watch to find out what's encountered.The acting overall is pretty good. The musical score by Frank Skinner is run-of-the-mill. It does the job, but it's nothing that's very distinctive. The movie has a good dose of classic Hitchcock suspense. I find that the more I watch this movie the more I like it.
