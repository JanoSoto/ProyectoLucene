I felt that &#145;Superman' was brought well to the bigscreen. Then the fuss that was made about the 1989 release of &#145;Batman' was needed, as the film deserved its high rating in my view. Then in 2002 we have the big blockbuster of &#145;Spiderman&#145;. This is one of the most popular comic book heroes. Now he has crawled onto our screens and spun his web, to win over millions of fans around the world.Young New York teenager Peter Parker is a geek. He isn't popular at school, he likes science, and doesn't have many friends. Nothing seems to be going his way until one fateful trip to Osborn technologies changes everything. When Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider, he gains super strength, a &#145;spider sense', the ability to stick to walls, and organic webspinners. With his newfound powers, he becomes Spider-man, and through a great tragedy learns an important life lesson With great power, comes great responsibility!To say that &#145;Spiderman' the movie was a little disappointing, for me is an understatement. I first of all want to say how much of a let down the script of this movie was. While I will admit that it tried, some of the language used did have the desired effect on me. Then take the &#145;love story' that was presented here. Instead of making it a great part of this film, I felt I halted the progress of it, as it made the story jump all over the place. I hope the script of the next Spider-man movie is much better than what the first movie's was.Then take the stars of this show. Tobey McGuire was a good choice as Peter Parker \/ Spider-man. I found him to be the perfect &#145;klutz', as the nerdy Peter Parker, then as he becomes our &#145;superhero', the transformation he puts on is excellent. Tobey McGuire is a Spider-man fan, so being the movie lead in this film was great for him. Yet his archenemy, &#145;the Green Goblin', was a character that was not human enough for me. He was played by veteran actor William Defoe. This was the crazy character of this film, and while it was trying to be scary in parts, for me it did not have the right effect. Instead, I feel it was taken straight from a comic book. That is not what I feel makes a great &#145;baddie'. The people in conjunction with this film should have looked at how well the Batman movie made the &#145;Joker' come to life way back in 1989. That is how I like to see the bad guys come to life in comic book movies.Other members of this cast include the stunning Kirsten Dunst. She portrayed the likable Mary Jane Watson. She was a great choice as this character, as I found her to be a bubbly and a very attractive girl. Unfortunately the script did not allow her to be the character that I thought she would be. Perhaps this is a good thing, but I would have liked her to be not jumping from one guy to another, which I can tell you does happen. Add in the good choice of Ben Parker and Aunty May, who were played by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris, who I thought were very good. So was the role of Harry Osborn, acted by James Franco. Harry was another character trying to win over Mary Jane. I hope all these actors return for the next movie.  There were certain parts to this film that I did and did not like. For instance I found the costume of our superhero to be such an &#145;attractive' outfit. This was adopted well from the comic books. I also enjoyed how our hero spins his web. This is one of the good special effects. Yet I did not like most of &#145;spideys' climbing sequences. They seem to be almost &#145;comic like', which for me did not satisfy what I hoped they would be. It was as if they were taken straight out of a comic book. This is one area that this movie definitely fell down in. This is where I believe the director of spider-man should have jumped in and made this film a lot more human, as this was his job in my view. Sam Raimi did a fairly good job, but I wished he changed certain aspects of this film, because Spider-man then might have been a great &#145;blockbuster'.Look I am sure if I was a young kid presented with watching this movie in the cinema, I would, pardon the pun, jump at the chance. Yet as an adult, I am a lot more critical of movies and need more satisfaction in different cinematic areas. Spider-man was a classic comic book hero, yet for me this movie did nothing to make his legend even greater. Then again this movie works because it gets bums on seats in the cinema, the merchandise to buy is huge, and is a childhood favourite. Yet for me, this film, while it is a blockbuster, I am one critic who would debate whether it deserved that status or not. Get caught in the web of your friendly neighbourhood, &#145;Spider-man'.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"18 May 2003","score":"","review":"  For me the top vampire movie of the 80's was 'The Lost Boys', but this one is up there with the best of them. The 80's saw a deluge of vampire movies, so for these to stand out amongst them was no mean feat.According to Tom Holland, the writer\/director of this movie, he wanted to do a movie with 'the boy who cried wolf' as a theme. He also had an interest in vampire stories and so he combined these two elements to create a very enjoyable and original script. Although not entirely true to 'the boy who cried wolf' since Charley did not make up the story before it happened for real, the concept of the movie, that is, a teenager with an interest in B grade horror movies see's a vampire claim a victim and cannot convince his friends of this, holds it's audience throughout the movie.Jerry Dandridge is a prime example of the type of vampire audiences saw in the 80's. He is suave, good - looking and has an eye for beautiful women - thus captilising on the sexual allure of being at the mercy of a being more powerful than yourself who needed your lifeblood to sustain his existence. His bloodlust was satiated by attacking the victim's neck, biting into it and sucking their blood. This also has strong sexual overtones since the neck can be an intimate area and giving or having someone take your blood is the ultimate submissive act since blood is the life. The vampire of the 80's has is own distinct personality and is able to interact as an ordinary citizen in everyday life. This is most unlike the vampire in Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' and FW Murnau's 'Nosferatu' who were more like the vampires of folklore, that is, they had repulsive features and were not much unlike scavenging rodents since they were perceived in past centuries as pests who were plague carriers. Some folklore is still evident in the 80's vampire - a vampire cannot enter your house unless invited, it cannot be seen in mirror's and is fearful of Christian symbols thus showing it for the malignant evil that it is. I believe that Holland has created a sound balance here by not introducing too much human personality traits into Dandridge that is so evident in today's vampires. This may be because he was influenced by the B grade movies since these movies are a strong part of the story. Further evidence of this is the character of Peter Vincent. Chris Sarandon is perfect for the role of Jerry. He has a commanding presence which makes him a powerful adversary for the heroes.Peter Vincent has proved to be the most endearing character and it would be hard to imagine anyone other than Roddy Mcdowall playing the role - Cushing of the 80's. His passing will mean that another sequel will quite rightly have a gaping hole in it which only he could fill. Part of why this is so is because he makes it so believable that he is an actor passionate about his B grade vampire hunter roles. He is the vampire hunter determined to rid the world of these vermin and holds high credibility within that world. This is in stark contrast to the real Peter Vincent who is financially struggling and finds that he is petrified when faced by the real vampire. Although he manages to gather enough courage to face Dandridge, he has to be saved by Charley. He fails to truly overcome his fear, but the audience is drawn to the failed hero who gave it his best shot. He is the underdog that we cheer for.The special effects of this movie also deserve special mention. They add to the B grade feel of the movie since the shape shifting of the vampire is overly grotesque and exaggerated. This is no criticism since this is what Holland wanted to create and thus it blends in rather than overawes.Also of note is the variety of different characters within the movie. You have Evil Ed who is interested in the occult and being a social misfit thus making him easy to seduce for Dandridge. There is Amy who is sexually prudent which makes her a viable victim for the predatory vampire. Charley is the average American teenager who has to grow up quickly if he is to overcome his ancient foe. Finally there is Billy Cole, the ghoul or zombie wholly dedicated to serving his master.The soundtrack is most notable within this movie since it adds to the fun we have at watching the not too serious B grade movie influenced 'Fright Night'. Each track is suited to the scene and accentuates the emotion that Holland is trying to brew. This is particularly well done in the nightclub scene.'Fright Night' is a great popcorn movie and never takes itself seriously. Part of the appeal of this movie is the fact that it has  a strong 80's feel to it - catchy soundtrack, hip teenagers, exaggerated special effects much like the exaggerated dress of the 80's such as shoulder pads, wild hairstyles and cheesy one - liners. Having said this, although it is obvious that the cast had fun playing their characters, they acting is of a high enough quality to ensure that this movie did not fall into the B grade abyss.

They add to the B grade feel of the movie since the shape shifting of the vampire is overly grotesque and exaggerated. This is no criticism since this is what Holland wanted to create and thus it blends in rather than overawes.Also of note is the variety of different characters within the movie. You have Evil Ed who is interested in the occult and being a social misfit thus making him easy to seduce for Dandridge. There is Amy who is sexually prudent which makes her a viable victim for the predatory vampire. Charley is the average American teenager who has to grow up quickly if he is to overcome his ancient foe. Finally there is Billy Cole, the ghoul or zombie wholly dedicated to serving his master.The soundtrack is most notable within this movie since it adds to the fun we have at watching the not too serious B grade movie influenced 'Fright Night'. Each track is suited to the scene and accentuates the emotion that Holland is trying to brew. This is particularly well done in the nightclub scene.'Fright Night' is a great popcorn movie and never takes itself seriously. Part of the appeal of this movie is the fact that it has  a strong 80's feel to it - catchy soundtrack, hip teenagers, exaggerated special effects much like the exaggerated dress of the 80's such as shoulder pads, wild hairstyles and cheesy one - liners. Having said this, although it is obvious that the cast had fun playing their characters, they acting is of a high enough quality to ensure that this movie did not fall into the B grade abyss.

David Niven put on a wonderful performance as wealthy Phileas Fogg, the staunchly English adventurer who wagers with his friends at the Reform Club that he can travel around the world in 80 days - not an easy task in 1872, when the movie is set. From that point on, we follow Fogg's adventures with his valet Passepartout (Cantinflas) as they battle against time to win the wager.There's a good use of humour throughout the movie. In particular, I enjoyed several scenes which demonstrate the English insistence on tea time, whatever the circumstances. While perhaps not culturally accurate, the movie also tries to give a flavour of the places that Fogg visits on his journey. So we see a Spanish bullfight, an Indian religious procession, a Chinese dragon dance, an American election and a fight against the redskins during a train trip from San Francisco to New York. All in good fun, and all enjoyable. There are also a number of cameos included (Buster Keaton, Frank Sinatra, John Gielgud among others) so keep an eye on who you're watching.The movie did slow to a crawl in a few places, mind you (I particularly think of the length of time we had to watch Fogg and Passepartout doing nothing in particular in the balloon.) However, overall the movie was quite enjoyable, if a little long at almost three hours. I don't know if this is an integral part of the movie or was just included on the version I saw, but this was worth watching if only for the first ten minutes or so, in which a narrator spoke about Jules Verne and then narrated the wonderful movie from the early 1900's based on Verne's story A Trip To The Moon as a lead-in to ... 80 Days.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 May 2003","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Based on the Jules Verne novel of the same name, the movie is an enjoyable adventure that the whole family can watch.

I have not - so far although eXistenZ hasn't lived up to expectations. Dead Ringers is another fine example of what Cronenberg can do. While the film is quite typical of his style, at the same time it's very different.Whether Cronenberg takes on science-fiction as in The Fly, psychological drama as in Dead Ringers, low-budget horror as in Shivers, it ends up with a similar spiraling-downwards plot. Although I have not seen all of his movies yet, all the ones I've seen, perhaps except eXistenZ, seem to go in this direction. Dead Ringers is no exception.Although my favorite film from Cronenberg so far is Videodrome, Dead Ringers is in the top league along with Dead Zone and Naked Lunch. However, be warned, this might not be what you expect if you've seen many other Cronenberg films. The element of gross-out and body modifications is there, but it's not prevailing, it just complements the story. The key to this movie is the psychological play between the two main characters, both played exceptionally by Jeremy Irons. In many respects the movie is similar to Dead Zone, where the key to the plot seems to be self-acceptance of the main character's new abilities and the fictional element of near-future visionsis only a tool.While I've never perceived Irons as a good actor, after viewing this movie I've changed my mind completely. I don't think many actors would be able to play the roles of the twins equally well. The only other actor I could now see in this role is Christopher Walken who was definitely the best possible selection for Dead Zone. I would definitely like to see Walken in this role, although Irons was indeed exceptional.If you've not yet seen this movie, make sure you have plenty of time and quiet when you see it, and, as other reviewers noticed, this is not really a film to watch with your girlfriend or friends on an easy-going evening.*ATTN SPOILERS* One thing that I've not noticed in the reviews though is the fact, that drugs play a very important role in this movie. To me it was just as scary as Requiem for a Dream - by showing the downside of drug addiction. And the last scenes, with the demolished office, reminded me a bit of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Decadence created by the twins' psychological problems combined with heavy drug use is quite intense.Although for me it's hard to understand why others may perceive this movie as boring or dull, it is indeed quite demanding - not for your average viewer. If you're looking for a cheap shocker - skip it. If you're renting this movie because it's in the top 10 of most shocking films - definitely skip it.I wouldn't recommend it as the first Cronenberg film to see either - although it's different than most of his works I've seen so far, I think it's useful to get the feel of what this director likes to do in the movies by watching some more direct shockers with hallucinogenic elements such as Videodrome or Naked Lunch.In general - I definitely recommend it but only to those that like ambitious, demanding cinema and are prepared for a difficult ride.
