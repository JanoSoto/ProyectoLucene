Melanie Lynskey is Pauline Parker, whose hair is almost as dark as her glare, and whom no doubt wishes she could exchange her thick New Zealand accent for something a bit striking and otherworldly. These are two girls who would not normally be drawn to each other, but because of medical conditions, find themselves a close friendship. Jackson indicates the blossoming of this by letting the debut actresses act, and be teenage girls; after the first conversation, Paul hurries home, dodging her mother's question to put on a new record - Mario Lanza, the world's greatest tenor, and her blissful reaction is all we need to know. They are both terrific performances and scream children instead of actresses reading lines in each little symptom of girls lost in their own worlds; the mocking tones in which Juliet mimics a 'friend' of her mother's, the way Paul drops her head into her hands whenever she is embarrassed by her father singing into a fish or her mother welcoming a boarder, how they skip together hand in hand and giggle and laugh endlessly in their own imagination. The visual effects, which are noticeably dated, seem to fit quite well with the context. When they first visualise the Fourth World, the mundane New Zealand is physically wiped away in swathes for the idyllic gardens and unicorns and giant butterflies, and a golden glow bathes their playtime. It does not look fluid or smooth, but transforms itself in the same way in which a child's mind unlocks little segments of their daydreams. The soundtrack tinkles along, Mario Lanza serenades, and the camera weaves and swoops its way through the air like the outstretched arms that they have exchanged for aeroplane wings, and swivels around in excitement. A show-tune could easily be dropped in here, and the whole scene could insert itself into Mary Poppins without a touch of difference. When they build a sandcastle, they lovingly craft intricate details and a storyline to match, and the camera makes itself tiny and matches each gallop of the sound design as it tours the majestic building, matching their vivid imagination. Only later, as the Fourth World leaks into the real, does the sound become more menacing; as irritations are beheaded and gutted for upsetting the creator. Aside from those bursts of imaginative violence (which all of us have had once in a while, even as adults - but this films takes it further), Jackson subtly imbues the real world with a haunting, suffocating quality, as if the girl's dreamland has begun to affect how they see reality, and how little they want to return to it. When a pastor offers up a pamphlet emblazoned with Jesus, there is a loud whoosh, dramatising how horrifying this confrontation must be, before a clay figure drags him away for execution. An extreme closeup likewise does the same to evil word the doctor theorises, a taboo back in the 50s. But I think it is much more than just physical love that they share; it is something much stronger. When Paul goes in search of the latter, the camera hovers over a backyard full of junk, and she is presented, climbed the railing, as some sort of prince to a Rapunzel, or a Romeo to a Juliet, in search of that romance in vain. That search leads her back to Juliet, who descends the staircase while the score crescendos in a gown and manner gracefully reminiscent of Cinderella, and Paul's face is awash with a sensual red glow. Harsh green light seems to constantly leak in through the windows, creating a sickly aura that seems to chase the girls and wind down the time they have together. When they are in separate beds, Selkirk hovers over the back of a nurse and smoothly connects the pair through their letters, and then the red and blue glows merge into each other so gorgeously, and they spend the night. All the while, Paul's diary voice-over narrates, and gives us insight into this relationship. It covers every thing from the childhood trivialities to the passionate moments, and is spoken with such a haughty distaste for the real and a wondrous longing for the imaginary. It almost seems normal and consequential when those shocking words are finally dropped remove mother. This is the film's crowning achievement to immerse us into Paul and Juliet's world, to make it so seductive, to make themselves so unconditionally necessary to each other, and then to slip in something so trivial, like murder. And it almost manages to convince us it is justified.

The tale of a savior for everyone lays as a backdrop for the 1971 film. Warren Beatty and Julie Christie join forces to bring a sense of civilization to the town of Presbyterian Church, which has little civilization and no church. A heavy western dealing with themes of isolation and redeemers, McCabe and Mrs. Miller came off a touch thematically weighed down.Upon his arrival to the town of Presbyterian Church, gambler John McCabe (Warren Beatty) quickly learns that the town of God is nearly God-less, as the church remains under construction. McCabe then designates himself to be the town's savior, the first nod to this enduring theme. He wants to bring his brand of civility to a township that, is, well, lacking. Deciding to build a brothel, McCabe is soon joined in his exploits by Mrs. Miller, a shrewd business-minded woman who seems to believe that she acts as a savior to the girls she employs. Soon, as their mutual business thrives, so do budding feelings between the entrepreneurs. Competing moral compasses keep McCabe and Mrs. Miller apart, as each walk among the desolate winter scene McCabe traverses reminds the viewer that the only certainty in life is solitude; we enter, and leave this world, alone. Soon, a battle erupts as the business is challenged by corporate interests who have invaded the town. The choice McCabe makes was perhaps the only one he could live with, but it holds desperate consequences for everyone else involved. The forever in solitude, John McCabe was played well by Warren Beatty who was able to execute the competing dualities of McCabe's character, who both wanted to be alone, but also wanted to be loved and needed. Julie Christie plays Mrs. Miller well also as the gruff, shrewd business woman, yet angel to the girls she employed. Personally, I get pulled into a movie's lighting. If the lighting is not right for the mood, the story is not being told properly. The lighting in McCabe and Mrs. Miller was overly dark, which fit the mood well, but was not contrasted enough with brightening during the lighter parts of the film. Another compelling aspect of the film was the cinematography. Shots of trees and mountains slated against the unfruitful harsh winter that was being endured were a true treat to the viewer. The shots were also pivotal to illustrate the deeper themes of the film. There's not much that photographs lonelier than a bare tree in the middle of winter. The audience learns that McCabe is like this tree, alone, yet seeking the cover of its familiarity. The audience eventually starts rooting for McCabe, in hopes that someday find his leaves.All-in-all, I applaud Robert Altman for providing audiences with such a deep film, and bringing such allegory and theme to the western genre. That being said, it was a little symbolism heavy. The Jesus-like moment in this film was not executed as well as the one in say, Raging Bull (1980), nor was it necessary to prove that theme to the audience. If only the director had more faith in his audience to reach the conclusions he was intending, rather than weighing down the film with so much symbolism, McCabe and Mrs. Miller could have risen to Classic status outside of the western genre. We will never know what could have happen, and even though I found the thematic elements over the top, I would recommend this film to any fans of great westerns, or Warren Beatty.

That's not always a bad thing, but in the way this movie presents it it feels like there is no effort and ends up coming off more like a video game- movie than anything else. The characters aren't anything special either. I wouldn't say they were bad, but they were never really focused on until the very end when we received some weird forced moment with Rambo. The action, which is the star of this movie, is boring. I personally don't like watching one overpowered person beating everyone up. One- sided fights just aren't my thing unfortunately. All the fights I felt were too slow and rather predictable too, so I found little entertainment in it. Sylvester Stallone particularly stood out to me as a bad actor. Now maybe that's just because that was supposed to be his character, where the only things he says are little grunting noises occasionally that are made to resemble words, but don't always succeed. Maybe he is a good actor, but he was just given crappy material to work with. Either way, he stood out as being another negative of the movie. Overall First Blood is nothing special. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, the characters are unfocused and sometimes forced, the action is boring, and the acting wasn't great. How this became a classic is beyond me, but maybe it just has to do with timing. Back when it first came out maybe it was incredibly original and deep, but now it stands as just an below average, effortless action movie. In the end I wouldn't recommend First Blood to anyone, because there's really nothing special or new about this movie that you haven't already seen a million times before.

Since the release of the new movie, I thought it was about time I revisited the movies before I went and saw the new one. I'm somewhat happy to say that the second prequel has held up for the most part. Unlike the Phantom Menace, which was pretty bad this time watching it, Attack of the Clones is much better. One of the biggest struggles of the first movie seemed to be in finding good actors. In the second installment we get much better ones. The acting is, although not fantastic, a vast improvement of the first one. Its very average and sometimes a little over the top, which I know is the style George Lucas was going for. Although it could be really cheesy at times, and the over the top acting felt fake and sometimes out of place, it was easy to look past and enjoy the film for what it was. The plot is, as I suspected, better than I remember. It's much more political, and is actually pretty interesting, more so than the first one. Although I'm not particularly fond of the whole let's just go to war to solve all our problems scenario, it certainly is more entertaining then negotiating.The characters were more focused on this time around. They were good for the most part. Not bad, but not great either. Anakin himself often seemed disinterested, but I assume that was just his acting ability. The CGI effects weren't always good. It was clear what was more focused on and what wasn't. I know that all the clones were CGI, but I felt like that was understandable and didn't really take away from the movie. Sure, sometimes, it was blatantly obviously that they were fake, but sometimes they looked real enough for you to believe them. I still wish there had been at least a few real clones, as it would have made the movie look a little better, but it's really not a big deal to me at all and I don't see why people seem to get so mad about it. Overall Attack of the Clones is just an average movie. Nothing particularly special about it. Not a bad movie, but not a good one either. I still enjoyed it, despite it not being that well-done. In the end I would only recommend this movie if you were really interested in it, or if you had already watched the Phantom Menace and wanted to continue.
