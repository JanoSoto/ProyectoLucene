When I realized that M was a 1930 black and white film in German, about a serial child murderer  I was ready to fast forward to the the end just to see what happened to Peter Lorre.   I was expecting a simplistic plot with the over-acting typical of the early talkies, and an unsympathetic evil Peter Lorre.What I really like about M is that things are not good vs. evil, black and white.  You end up with conflicting feelings about all the groups.   The evil Peter Lorre is sadly mentally ill and you worry about him as he is being tracked like an animal.  The good police are ineffective and doing evil by trampling on everyones rights and subsequently making everyone mad at the police.  The evil gangsters, in reaction to the increased police activity hurting their businesses, are doing good by systematically tracking down the murderer.I was very surprised at how modern M felt.  It felt like a modern Hitchcock movie.  You are given more information than any of the characters and then you worry about what the players will do as the discover what you already know.   Peter Lorre was used perfectly in M.   He has very little dialog until his speech at the end of the film.    That makes him both more frightening and more sympathetic in the beginning and it makes his final speech more dramatic because you have been waiting through the entire movie to hear what he thinks.  That works especially well for Peter Lorre because of either his limited acting range or his  type-casting his voice immediately suggests someone evil and deranged.  Keeping him quiet keeps us guessing about what is going on inside him.Some of the reviews called this a scary movie, but  I thought is was thought provoking and compelling.

I expected a lot from this film, after all, it outlines something horrifying and truly a tragedy, but I couldn't help thinking that this film undermined the sensitivity of this subject by including a greedy, selfish, profiteering, womanizing German businessman in the story. I think that if you really want to learn more about the Holocaust, it should not be through films such as this, but through actual real-life documentaries that include no other unnecessary characters\/stories, but truly tell the real pain, the real hurt and loss of the Jewish people who were treated so badly just because they believed differently from others. Regardless, there were some truly powerful moments in the film The pictures of the starving prisoners who were forced to strip and be inspected by Nazi doctors, who would determine whether they could work or whether they should be killed. The little girl in the bright red dress, the only color, the only sunshine, in an otherwise gray, dark period of time, the very essence of innocence, and her symbolism later in the film when her lifeless body is wheelbarrowed over to the ever-growing pile of dead bodies that were to be incinerated. When Amon Goeth's young Jewish maid asks Oskar Schindler why he shot an elderly woman who was just passing by, bothering no one, looking at no one; his reply because she meant nothing to him, she was just one of those people who neither bothered nor pleased him, just that she was just a random person with no meaning to him, was the reason why he so cruelly took a life so easily.I do think this film is worth watching, no doubt, but please don't automatically assume you know everything about the Holocaust because you watched this film; this film portrayed life less harshly than life for the imprisoned actually was.

Jaco van Dormael has not achieved simply a masterpiece, that would have been too simplistic; he has achieved one of those rare monumental works of art in the cinematographic world which defies any kind of encapsuling. Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? No it is the story of Georges, a wonderful funny pitiful laughable loving frightened beautiful personality, a sufferer of the Downes Syndrome.

A successful banking salesman, Harry, bumps into Georges they were both going in opposite directions with absolutely opposing ideas, problems and priorities; skillfully van Dormael melts these two unlikely men into a warm friendship, but which is so much more than the good buddy friendship of those having a beer down the road. This is a relationship which develops into a profound needing by both for the other.

Jaco van Dormael has not achieved simply a masterpiece, that would have been too simplistic; he has achieved one of those rare monumental works of art in the cinematographic world which defies any kind of encapsuling. Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? No it is the story of Georges, a wonderful funny pitiful laughable loving frightened beautiful personality, a sufferer of the Downes Syndrome. It is a story which has you laughing through your tears, but this is not one of those classic tear-jerkers; this film moves through a world that has you at once mixing your feelings of compassion or pity or even shame with those of admiration, warmth and even love. A successful banking salesman, Harry, bumps into Georges they were both going in opposite directions with absolutely opposing ideas, problems and priorities; skillfully van Dormael melts these two unlikely men into a warm friendship, but which is so much more than the good buddy friendship of those having a beer down the road. This is a relationship which develops into a profound needing by both for the other. The cuasi-surrealist scenes fit in perfectly Georges recalls (or invents) past scenes of his life while either day-dreaming or sleeping; even the almost phantasmagorical final scene is totally correct. The only scene which might be considered a little out of place is when they steal a bus and drive it out of the show-rooms.  However, this does not detract from the whole. This film is a monument.

This description could not fit better for the foreign flick Chungking Express. Originally released in 1994 (before a cheap marketing scheme by Miramax to re-release it as one of Quentin Tarantino's top five picks), this movie takes place in Hong Kong three years before the switchover.  Even though it seems, on the surface, that this movie has nothing to do with the current politics, the deeper you look, the more there is relating to this. Chungking follows four middle-aged people though their daily lives for short period of time.  The story is actually broken into two halves, each with two of the characters.  It shows the pain of love, the glory of life, and the happiness of companionship. I am sure it is already clear that there is not much I can say about this plot.  It is just merely a film about daily life and average people.  The first half of the movie follows Cop #223 (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and how his life intertwines with a female drug dealer (Brigitte Lin).  As the second half of the movie picks up, it consists of the romantic relationship between food service worker Faye (the musical sensation Faye Wong) and Cop #663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). Director Wong Kar-wai did a magnificent job with this movie; but the thing is, you truly need to see it more than once.  After the first viewing of this movie, I felt very frustrated and disappointed.  The plot was weak and the storyline was just plain awful.  But, after giving it a second chance, I loved it.  The directing style is much different from mainstream American movies and it does work.  And well. The filming was fantastic with beautifully shot scenes including still frame and fast-paced street runs.  This added so much to this movie.  In addition, the soundtrack was absolutely superb.  With American classics, quick beat remixes, and even Faye Wong adding her own touch to the soundtrack, the music really made me love the movie.  It fits every scene perfectly.  Interestingly, the songs repeat over and over if the same characters or scene is being filmed.  What a great technique. This movie was made to be studied in film classes.  GO BIG RED! Do not try to sit down and watch this once on some lonely Friday night.  You really do need to see it at least twice to fully appreciate its greatness.

It is about lying and its consequences.Kresten, a young go-go company man is marrying the boss's daughter, but hides, then fabricates his country past.  He doesn't get away with it for long and ends up shamed and divorced.  Likewise, a young prostitute, Liva, tries to flee her surroundings, but they follow her and in the end visit -  literally - wrath on her new home.The only spiritually pure character, content in his surroundings, too innocent of wit to lie, is Kresten's retarded brother Rud.  It seems that everything he says, no matter how far-fetched, turns out to be true.  He is also the teacher of kindness who, since he is inarticulate, can only teach by example.Actually, I think the most unambiguously satisfying relationship here is between Rud and Liva's beastly little brother Bjarke. It is Bjarke who can't handle the truth about himself and his sister.  Quickly, the stereotypes he has learned to brutalize in the social Darwinian hell of boarding school confront him with their humanity and teach him that life doesn't have to be the daily exercise in cynicism that he and his sister suppose.There is atonement for all three, visited in different forms, but ultimately redeeming and providing a hopeful ending to the story.Unfortunately, there are a few problems in Mifune which marred my viewing.  A major one is the text, which is badly abused in translation to English.  For some reason, the translator has seen fit to turn words which in Danish mean damn or hell into f**k.

Some of the critiques I have read on `Enemy' actually say that they should have built(S-P-E-L-L-E-D) the characters more in this movie for it to be compared to and as good as S.P.R. WHAT?! They're people with `class' differences in a war! Pretty Easy! I don't want the movie to deal with character building that I can figure out on my own.(also it makes an already long movie, too long) So actually Enemy At The Gates is a welcome breath of fresh air. Not only do I like it for the symbolisms and messages (possibly hidden to the layman movie goer) , but it has lots of action and twists(both physical and mental.),and finally because it has a `real Feeling' to it. First lets cover the messages and\/or symbolism, hidden or maybe not so hidden as long as you can... think. I don't want to give it away but one of the `hidden' features has to do with the fact that some people that saw this movie and then see my review will say `What does he mean, he likes the `real feeling' of the movie?

I will say to you,  `neither should you!! And if you do, shame on you.' Now as I stated before the action and twists will have the layman moviegoer enjoying this movie as much as I did.

There is also lots of shooting and shells blowing up and bodies everywhere (in fact the beginning is very similar and comparable to `Ryan' , which is of course important in a war movie. But remember girls this is not just a `war' movie so please don't miss it. But truthfully ladies this also is NOT A ROMANCE as I have sometimes seen it wrongly billed. I am not a critic that likes to tell you the movie while critiquing it(DON'T READ this next line if you don't want to know one part of the movie) but the relationship between Jude, Fiennes and Weisz is another symbol of the class struggle going on throughout the movie(oops gave up 1 of those `thinking' aspects of the movie) and is NOT A ROMANTIC ONE, ie, the part where Jude is writing letters back to his `fans' and is being corrected his misspellings by Fiennes as we find out Weisz is an ex university student and owns hundreds of books.(where will she fall?

It is violent, very violent, and it treats these scenes in a way that has Scorsese looking like a squirrel scratching at a pussy-willow and at half the length is more ruthless. The no-named gangster protagonist, however, performed by Bettany, and Thewlis' Freddie Mays demonstrate the dualist animalistic violent\/civilised sophisticate with much more sincerity to life and subtlety than the Pitt\/Norton partnership, resulting in a much more convincing and effective, non-glamourised story. Visually there are echoes of A Clockwork Orange in Bettany's eyes (we are constantly told to look into them, as if they reveal the devil himself) - he has obviously been chosen for the comparative similarity to those ofMacdowell's eyes in that film. The Kubrickian influence, however, runs deeper; stark, atomic visual compositions, with an emotive soundtrack and themes of dehumanisation colour the film in a variety of filters down to the script itself.At the end, after striving to become the 'Butcher of Mayfair' for 30 years, Macdowell convinces us of his success, yet is somehow left unfulfilled. The man he wanted to be found peace in the love of a woman, education and the renunciation of violence (he couldn't exact a revenge killing on the gangster, even after a confession of betrayal).  We are left asking, as does the gangster what makes you the better man, Professor? but Mays admits himself that he is only a sad man in a crap suit. My companions had also rented Shaft, a Hollywood (ie expensive, glamourous, well-made and well-sold, with big name star actors) discussion of a serious topic (the ill of racism), but it was this film which left them still talking several hours later, both ends of the spectrum intelligently and much more enjoyably catered for.

But on entering the video shop searching for the middle ground, something acceptable to my two companions who wanted a chick-flick we came to talk- type and exploitative snuff-type we want to see handicapped people get more handicapped, we saw the cover and these views of an ultra-hard but surprisingly enjoyable evening resurfaced so we took our choice and paid our money.It was no waste.This film is notable for being a cut above the present ream of British gangster flicks being produced currently for a number of reasons. Firstly it hold no comparision with Snatch and it's ilk; it is not entertaining, and this is a good thing. Secondly it does address a serious subject in a serious way, so seriously in fact (according to all accounts here and elsewhere) that it has divided viewers in deciding it's value.Comparisons with recent movies abound, but it struck me as holding it's ground somewhere between GoodFellas and Fight Club. It is violent, very violent, and it treats these scenes in a way that has Scorsese looking like a squirrel scratching at a pussy-willow and at half the length is more ruthless.

Of course, it's doubly Blow's misfortune that it's not a very good movie.Blow tells the story of George Jung, a likable Bostonian who was one of the central figures in the explosion of cocaine in the 80s.  It's a criminal biopic, sort of.  It's an exploration of a national phenomenon, kind of. It's a story about a man watching as everything he holds dear slips inexorably away from him, in a way.  It covers a lot of ground.  In this way, it resembles GoodFellas, but has none of that film's spark, attitude, or vivid slices-of-life.Part of the problem, I think, is in the source material.  The movie is based on a book co-written by Jung, and in many ways it is a self-serving narrative.  Unlike GoodFellas, (adapted from Wiseguy) Blow doesn't look too far past its protagonist's worldview, and this skews the story badly.  We watch as he Forrest Gumps his way to the top of the cocaine trade.  Jung is not particularly interesting.  He is not a criminal mastermind, not a charismatic leader of men, not a sharp businessman, not a ruthless operator.  He's like a criminal version of Peter Sellers in Being There.  He just shows up.  It's a credit to Johnny Depp's performance that we care about this guy even a little.Jung's fall comes about because everyone in his life betrays him.  They have various reasons (mostly greed, naturally), but the movie doesn't elucidate them.  We are left with the impression that everyone was just unreasoningly hostile to poor Georgie, and pathologically bent on his destruction. George doesn't seem to understand why all this is happening to him, but neither does the movie.The casting is all good news\/bad news.  Ray Liotta is sadly affecting as George's gentle father who, if he has any judgments about his son's lifestyle, generally keeps them to himself.  We don't get enough of him, though.  On the other hand, we get way too much of horribly miscast Rachel Griffiths, in a shrill, grating turn as his mother.  Penelope Cruz junkies should note that despite her high billing, she is not in very much of the movie, and in much of that she's a harpy.  Franka Potente fares even worse. There is a striking performance, however, by the girl who plays Jung's daughter, and his devotion to her is one of the few things in the movie that rings right.The movie itself is not that well made.  It fails as a criminal biography, and it isn't detailed enough to be a compelling examination of the cocaine phenomenon.  Pablo Escobar, the once and future king of illicit pharmacology, makes an extremely brief appearance, just long enough to remove his sunglasses and have someone shot (Escobar here cuts something of a dashing figure; one wonders if he wouldn't have made a better subject for the movie.  Never mind.)  The general presentation of Jung's accomplishments is dubious (in one scene, he offers to tutor a roomful of cons in the fine art of drug moving, impressing them with his declaration that he was caught in Chicago with 660 pounds of grass.  Somehow, the fact that he was CAUGHT with it isn't exactly a ringing endorsement of his smuggling skills).  Many scenes are silly, such as when Cruz and Depp get hot-and-heavy right after engaging in the most banal flirting this side of a frat party (What are you smiling at? What are YOU smiling at? I don't know.)  In addition, there is a running narration by Jung that doesn't add anything to the movie except clumsy exposition.  The movie is also about two montages shy of becoming a slide show.  In theory, this is a visual metaphor for the fast, surreal world of drugs.  In practice, you can't see what's going on and get annoyed. There are, admittedly, a couple of wrenching scenes at the very end, but they're too little, and they come too late.In the end, Blow leaves us with a few lessons  1. Cocaine is pretty bad for you.  2. Trusting people (especially if they're Colombian) is REALLY bad for you.  3. George Jung, when you get down to it, was kind of a loser.

Upon first seeing this collage of scenes I was left with the crisp picture of a perfectly blank screen.  This image is a reflection of what I was able to draw from the muddled combination of story lines thrown together by director and writer Wong Kar-Wai. On a second viewing of the film this blank screen was slowly filled in with slurred images of bodies in motion and a deep feeling of loss.  In both cases the images were followed by the ever nagging question of so what?  In neither case was I able to draw any cohesive story line, or plot development. Maybe it is that I just don't get it.  The fact that movie guru Quentin Tarantino endorses this movie immediately tells me that there is something wrong with me.  Perhaps it is because I am simply Jack's raging hatred for pointless endorsements by quasi celebrities, but I feel that if a movie is truly good that it won't need some overly dramatized sell-out to take it upon himself, for a tidy fee, to enlighten us dopey Americans on what film is supposed to be.  Well Mr. Tarantino, I am sorry but if this is what a film is supposed to be like consider me the Rainman, because this is definitely, definitely, not what I look for in a film.Even with my being a little slow in the head I do have some points of exactly why I don't feel this is the masterpiece it was built up to be. The first issue to cover is the disorienting scene and quick cuts.  I understand this is to impose the same disorientating feeling of hopeless love felt by the policemen 223 and 663 onto the audience.  This, however, was done so frequently that I had to grip the side of the chair as to not become nauseous. The two plot lines being crammed into this hour and forty minute film seem to leave the feeling of being tricked into buying a VW with two rear ends. In that there is no real beginning to either story line leaving you not knowing which direction it supposed to go in.
