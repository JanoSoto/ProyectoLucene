[{"date":"18 September 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan prove three's far from a charm in this limp, flat, by-the-numbers romantic comedy, their third (and last) such collaboration. Ryan plays the owner of a small children's bookstore who, when her shop comes under fire from a big-box retailer around the corner, finds solace in the advice of an anonymous e-mail buddy. Spoiler alert, said buddy turns out to be the billionaire owner of said retailer (Hanks), and the two dance around like marionettes with a sliced string or two for the next two hours, narrowly avoiding each other's identities while gnashing teeth and slinging mud in the press. It's an irritating story, filled with irritating people doing irritating things. Hanks and Ryan are locked in on cruise control, looking down their noses at the material (and, perhaps, at the doofs who actually make such online connections), and enjoy none of the easy chemistry and warm charm they enjoyed in Joe Versus the Volcano or, to a lesser extent, Sleepless in Seattle. The '90s mascara is caked on thick, too, with eye-rolling mainstream rock soundtrack choices, cookie cutter casting stereotypes and an era-typical Hollywood take on all things cyber. It's bad, empty, corporate-friendly trash.
