[{"date":"30 July 2014","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Prequels are always dangerous. One has to tell a story where anyone familiar with the franchise knows where all the main pieces end up. Even The Hobbit, which had a relatively easy time with it, bloated the film(s) unnecessarily. Star Wars though had a very clear start point in Episode IV; there's little that one can be surprised with by the end of the prequel. In the case of Phantom Menace this is even more difficult, as it is more 2-hour prologue than prequel.Star Wars Episode I is the renowned disappointment of the Star Wars saga, with massive build-up and let down expectations (it certainly didn't help that The Matrix was released the same year). Yet certainly the hype has hurt it- it's certainly no worse than Attack of the Clones.George Lucas once again returns to the helm for Episode I, as well as writing the story and screenplay. Which brings the good and the bad. Gorgeous locales, fantastic character and creature design, and some truly great action scenes. Yet it also brings dodgy dialogue, weak characterisation, pacing and story.Episode I has two Jedi- Obi-Wan Kenobi and his mentor Qui-Gon Jinn- attempt to negotiate trade, before getting trapped on a planet and meeting a talented young boy, Anakin Skywalker, and the return of the Evil Sith. The plot would be more interesting if we knew why things were happening- there is a trade blockade, but we are never fully aware of what is trying to be achieved or wider motives. This ties in with a plot which builds Ian McDiarmid's future emperor as he rises through the Republic Senate. Ian McDiarmid shines and steals scenes under both his guises, but the Senate 'beauracracy' that characters are quick to criticise is a caricature without the depth needed for that form of plot.The trade blockade develops into a ground assault against the planet Naboo, but the two races on Naboo are either underdeveloped (Humans) or loathed (Gungan). The latter is especially problematic, as our tie is the infamous and thoroughly annoying Jar Jar Binks, an unnecessary attempt at cringe-worthy 'comedy'. A battle between faceless droids and faceless\/hated Gungans lacks impact.George Lucas' screenplay certainly has a mixed result for the characters. Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn oozes wisdom, and brings an older but headstrong figure to lead the film. He fairs better than Obi-Wan, who is sidelined for almost half the film and never really develops. The young Jake Lloyd is serviceable as Anakin, and almost pleasant by comparison to Hayden Christensen's performance. The problem is that while Attack of the Clones layers Anakin's flaws heavy, Phantom Menace has next to none to speak of, giving not a single hint that he will one day be Darth Vader. The incongruity is odd.Darth Maul gets only a couple of lines of dialogue as the movie's central antagonist, and coupled with his lack of doing...anything, he has nothing particularly memorable for most of the film. This almost pays off however, as the intimidation his silence creates, coupled with a fantastic lightsabre duel works.All of this is a roundabout way to say that the screenplay is simply the weakest part of the movie. The actors are capable, the technical side is great. But it's marred with shoddy dialogue, an end that is already signposted, and just odd decisions. Jar Jar, the concerning 'Asian' stereotypes of the Federation, the shallow politics, the midi-chlorians, sidelining Obi-Wan. Oh, and Anakin's immaculate conception. That's just awful. It's got all of the pieces, but never puts them in the best places.However, for all that, one cannot fault the technical side. The effects still look great, the choreography is solid, but its the creativity of the design that shines. Even if it wasn't as pretty looking, it would still be memorable. And John Williams returns for a fantastic score, with Duel of the Fates being the obvious highlight.It may be one of the weakest of the saga, and certainly the most unnecessary (there's a reason that many Hatchet cuts remove the film), but it's not horrific. Still, a disappointment. ","genre":null},{"date":"30 July 2014","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Prequels are always dangerous.
