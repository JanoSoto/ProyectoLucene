He's pulled off some truly stellar performances during his long career. Unfortunately, a great actor does not equal a great film; any actor, regardless of his talent, can choose some bad parts, and some bad movies. Hopkins is one of those actors. He's chosen some very bad parts, and this is, to some degree, one of them. The film starts out somewhat good, presenting an interesting drama and some fairly interesting characters. About 30 minutes into it, it turns into a survival film, which is quite good, and it seems intent on showing us a true, realistic story of surviving in nature, in an area that is far away from civilization. However, it soon turns into a man versus nature type film, by having the characters fight a bear, rather than try to survive. Not long after, it tries to go back to being about survival, but this time it tries to integrate cheap thrills in the form of abrupt character changes, that take place for no apparent reason. Finally, it ends, in the exact way you had predicted it would end from the very moment you saw the cover and was informed that it was a Hollywood production about survival. The plot is pretty good, but had it stayed on track, it would have been much better. It also has a bad pace, I was quite bored for far too much of the movie, considering that it's just less than 2 hours long. The acting is great, both of the leads are great. Their characters are just far too uninteresting and almost cliche-like for us to care when they're in danger. Also, far too much of the film is too Hollywood-like. Namely the scenes with the bear; they're well-done, certainly, the bear training was excellent and the filming of said sequences was good too; but it just felt too lame and linear the way it seemed to be constantly chasing them. The dialog was fairly good, but way too cliched. It's also far too predictable; I doubt that anyone was surprised or shocked by the ending. It was all the way through entirely obvious who would and who wouldn't make it out alive. All in all, a decent enough film, but should have been better. I recommend it to fans of Hopkins, Baldwin and the survival movie genre. Just don't expect too much. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 August 2004","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Anthony Hopkins is a good actor; scratch that, he's a great actor.

I am not one to doubt studio promotions, but just like everybody else I was game to find out if it was so.  Did I come out of Superman The Movie believing that indeed the son of Jor-el also known as Kal-el also known as Superman also known as Clark Kent could take to the airways without benefit of plane, hot air balloon, rocket pack, or zeppelin?   Nahhh...of course not, but Christopher Reeve looked a lot better faking it then any of his predecessors such as George Reeve and Kirk Alyn.   The truth is that Superman The Movie has a whole lot going for it besides the flight abilities of Reeve.  It also has a multitude of things that work against it.Unless you're some kind of a vampire who has been locked away in a casket for the past hundred years or so, you pretty much know the story.  The Planet Krypton which has a Red Sun was spinning around out there in the far reaches of space somewhere.  Jor-el (Marlon Brando) had come to the conclusion that Krypton was going to explode wiping out all Kryptonians.  Unable to convince anyone else of his findings, and not having a spaceship available that would carry him and Mrs. Kal-el (Susannah York), he packed up his only begotten son Kal-el along with his pampers and blasted him off towards Earth.  Since Earth has a yellow sun, this would somehow increase the density of Kal-el, giving him super powers far beyond anybody but the publishers of DC comics could ever imagine.  After being adopted by a farm couple known as Ma and Pa Kent (Phyllis Thaxter & Glenn Ford), Kal-el became young Clark Kent.  Later in life he took a job as an ace reporter at the Daily Planet ran by Editor Perry White (Jackie Cooper), which he used as a secret identity until he was needed to get down and get funky in his identity of Superman, protector of truth, justice and the American way.   It was at the Daily Planet that he met the love of his life, Ace Reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder).  Lois had the hots for Superman too as long as he was Superman and not Clark Kent.  When he was Clark, Lois wouldn't be caught dead in a Honeymoon Suite at Niagara Falls with him.  But that's another story, as you well know.Before dispensing with the well known back story, Superman opens with a sequence where three criminals are banished into The Phantom Zone in order to set up Superman II.  You just have to give it props for that instead of waiting until just before the credits role to tack on the obligatory sequel setting end as most film makers have a penchant for doing.  Of course it helps when you know for sure there's going to be a number 2 before your number one makes it onto the big screen.   Marlon Brando is okay as Jor-el but I can never seem to shake the feeling that I'm watching Brando in a white wig our forefathers would themselves have been proud to wear, and his delivery amounts to giving some kind of lecture to the Continental Congress.    Krypton itself is not at all like one would imagine having read the comics, as it is displayed here as some kind of eternal homage to cubic zirconium.  It's pretty to look at but has no substance.This movie version doesn't spend much time with Clark as a boy, but they are some of the best moments in the film in spite of the fact that Jeff East who plays young Clark had his dialog dubbed by Reeve.   Other than near the end of the film, it's the only time the film shows some real heart regarding Superman or anyone else in it.  One almost hated to see Superman\/Clark grow up.In the comics that I grew up with in the sixties, Clark was always portrayed to be somewhat of a coward by Superman, in order to help protect his secret identity.  In Superman The Movie, Reeve's Clark is not only a girly man but is pretty much a bumbling idiot.  While it strikes much more of a contrast between Clark and Superman, it is overplayed and overdone to the point that it ends up making us dread the moments when Superman does become Clark.  That being said, when Reeve does put on his cape and takes flight, his portrayal as Superman is without peer.I don't have much of a problem with Margot Kidder's portrayal of Lois Lane as it seems to be right on the mark as the character was written for her.  The problem is not with her characterization but not for one minute do we believe in Superman's sudden infatuation with her or why he is even attracted to her.  The only concern Lois seems to have is where is her next big story coming from and how long it is till her next cigarette.  She seems to be the epitome of a liberated woman, so the fact that she would suddenly go ga-ga over Superman doesn't quite hold water even if he does take time out to rescue her early in the picture, and later give her flying lessons.  The relationship is never developed in a way that makes any sense at all.Gene Hackman is way over the top also as Lex Luthor but at least he does it with a bit of style and fun.  Not so Ned Beatty who plays his henchman Otis.   Otis is supposed to be comic relief, but the only relief you'll get is if you pop a couple of antacids in order to be able to stomach the character.  We do not for one minute believe that Lex Luther would keep a total dunce such as Otis around for any reason, as there would just have to be less excruciatingly painful criminals in Metropolis willing to run errands for him.  The character of Otis is more than just an annoyance as every scene he is in drags the story down to a mediocre level.  Valerie Perrine's Miss Teschmacher is kind of a dumb bulb also, but her character is at least kept in check to the point where she is even likeable.  And alas, just as most of the characters are in this film, Perry White is played by Jackie Cooper as a simple minded goof ball.What is good about Superman are the flying sequences.  As a matter of fact when Superman is zooming around performing various rescues ranging from a cat to a president and capturing criminals, the film as a whole takes flight.  The special effect all around are well done, especially Superman's rescue of Lois from a helicopter, and later as he races around California to repair the damage being done during an Earthquake.  The scenes where he takes to the sky with Lois for a romantic interlude are almost lyrical.John Williams give us another one of his no holds bar musical scores.  Its well done for this kind of film, and apparently the producers and director thought so too as it plays over top of some of the longest running opening and closing film credits known to man.  In other words, when the film starts you'll have plenty of time to still pop another batch of popcorn, run to the bathroom and make it back to your recliner before we come close to reaching the planet Krypton.Besides Otis, the biggest problem with Superman The Movie comes near the end.  In order to resolve a plot situation which if left as it was would have caused major problems for the subsequent sequel, the writer, director or somebody has Superman perform a stunt that reeks of lazy film making.  It opens a plot hole as wide and as deep as the Grand Canyon.  Usually in a film based on a comic book character, one can overlook such devices, but this one is so glaring and obvious in its ineptitude that it one will be forced to mumble a certain word pertaining to bull droppings.  I haven't felt this cheated since my first girlfriend dumped me for another guy.Superman The Movie is highly watchable in many aspects.  With a little more thought and consideration in how to bring the classic characters to the screen, it could have been one of the great comic book films of all time.

I am not one to doubt studio promotions, but just like everybody else I was game to find out if it was so.  Did I come out of Superman The Movie believing that indeed the son of Jor-el also known as Kal-el also known as Superman also known as Clark Kent could take to the airways without benefit of plane, hot air balloon, rocket pack, or zeppelin?   Nahhh...of course not, but Christopher Reeve looked a lot better faking it then any of his predecessors such as George Reeve and Kirk Alyn.   The truth is that Superman The Movie has a whole lot going for it besides the flight abilities of Reeve.  It also has a multitude of things that work against it.Unless you're some kind of a vampire who has been locked away in a casket for the past hundred years or so, you pretty much know the story.  The Planet Krypton which has a Red Sun was spinning around out there in the far reaches of space somewhere.  Jor-el (Marlon Brando) had come to the conclusion that Krypton was going to explode wiping out all Kryptonians.  Unable to convince anyone else of his findings, and not having a spaceship available that would carry him and Mrs. Kal-el (Susannah York), he packed up his only begotten son Kal-el along with his pampers and blasted him off towards Earth.  Since Earth has a yellow sun, this would somehow increase the density of Kal-el, giving him super powers far beyond anybody but the publishers of DC comics could ever imagine.  After being adopted by a farm couple known as Ma and Pa Kent (Phyllis Thaxter & Glenn Ford), Kal-el became young Clark Kent.  Later in life he took a job as an ace reporter at the Daily Planet ran by Editor Perry White (Jackie Cooper), which he used as a secret identity until he was needed to get down and get funky in his identity of Superman, protector of truth, justice and the American way.   It was at the Daily Planet that he met the love of his life, Ace Reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder).  Lois had the hots for Superman too as long as he was Superman and not Clark Kent.  When he was Clark, Lois wouldn't be caught dead in a Honeymoon Suite at Niagara Falls with him.  But that's another story, as you well know.Before dispensing with the well known back story, Superman opens with a sequence where three criminals are banished into The Phantom Zone in order to set up Superman II.  You just have to give it props for that instead of waiting until just before the credits role to tack on the obligatory sequel setting end as most film makers have a penchant for doing.  Of course it helps when you know for sure there's going to be a number 2 before your number one makes it onto the big screen.   Marlon Brando is okay as Jor-el but I can never seem to shake the feeling that I'm watching Brando in a white wig our forefathers would themselves have been proud to wear, and his delivery amounts to giving some kind of lecture to the Continental Congress.    Krypton itself is not at all like one would imagine having read the comics, as it is displayed here as some kind of eternal homage to cubic zirconium.  It's pretty to look at but has no substance.This movie version doesn't spend much time with Clark as a boy, but they are some of the best moments in the film in spite of the fact that Jeff East who plays young Clark had his dialog dubbed by Reeve.   Other than near the end of the film, it's the only time the film shows some real heart regarding Superman or anyone else in it.  One almost hated to see Superman\/Clark grow up.In the comics that I grew up with in the sixties, Clark was always portrayed to be somewhat of a coward by Superman, in order to help protect his secret identity.  In Superman The Movie, Reeve's Clark is not only a girly man but is pretty much a bumbling idiot.  While it strikes much more of a contrast between Clark and Superman, it is overplayed and overdone to the point that it ends up making us dread the moments when Superman does become Clark.  That being said, when Reeve does put on his cape and takes flight, his portrayal as Superman is without peer.I don't have much of a problem with Margot Kidder's portrayal of Lois Lane as it seems to be right on the mark as the character was written for her.  The problem is not with her characterization but not for one minute do we believe in Superman's sudden infatuation with her or why he is even attracted to her.  The only concern Lois seems to have is where is her next big story coming from and how long it is till her next cigarette.  She seems to be the epitome of a liberated woman, so the fact that she would suddenly go ga-ga over Superman doesn't quite hold water even if he does take time out to rescue her early in the picture, and later give her flying lessons.  The relationship is never developed in a way that makes any sense at all.Gene Hackman is way over the top also as Lex Luthor but at least he does it with a bit of style and fun.  Not so Ned Beatty who plays his henchman Otis.   Otis is supposed to be comic relief, but the only relief you'll get is if you pop a couple of antacids in order to be able to stomach the character.  We do not for one minute believe that Lex Luther would keep a total dunce such as Otis around for any reason, as there would just have to be less excruciatingly painful criminals in Metropolis willing to run errands for him.  The character of Otis is more than just an annoyance as every scene he is in drags the story down to a mediocre level.  Valerie Perrine's Miss Teschmacher is kind of a dumb bulb also, but her character is at least kept in check to the point where she is even likeable.  And alas, just as most of the characters are in this film, Perry White is played by Jackie Cooper as a simple minded goof ball.What is good about Superman are the flying sequences.  As a matter of fact when Superman is zooming around performing various rescues ranging from a cat to a president and capturing criminals, the film as a whole takes flight.  The special effect all around are well done, especially Superman's rescue of Lois from a helicopter, and later as he races around California to repair the damage being done during an Earthquake.  The scenes where he takes to the sky with Lois for a romantic interlude are almost lyrical.John Williams give us another one of his no holds bar musical scores.  Its well done for this kind of film, and apparently the producers and director thought so too as it plays over top of some of the longest running opening and closing film credits known to man.  In other words, when the film starts you'll have plenty of time to still pop another batch of popcorn, run to the bathroom and make it back to your recliner before we come close to reaching the planet Krypton.Besides Otis, the biggest problem with Superman The Movie comes near the end.  In order to resolve a plot situation which if left as it was would have caused major problems for the subsequent sequel, the writer, director or somebody has Superman perform a stunt that reeks of lazy film making.  It opens a plot hole as wide and as deep as the Grand Canyon.  Usually in a film based on a comic book character, one can overlook such devices, but this one is so glaring and obvious in its ineptitude that it one will be forced to mumble a certain word pertaining to bull droppings.  I haven't felt this cheated since my first girlfriend dumped me for another guy.Superman The Movie is highly watchable in many aspects.  With a little more thought and consideration in how to bring the classic characters to the screen, it could have been one of the great comic book films of all time.  Unfortunately, when you can only make me think of what might have been or could have been, I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Superman The Movie is a C+.

To complicate matters more Baylor get involved with the drafting of a will of his landlord and a young beautiful girl, beaten up by an abusive dangerous husband.Now, one should remember that movies and books are completely different medias, so that a story told in a book are impossible to tell in a movie without some changes and cuts. That is the ground rules when adapting a book to movie. In many cases the story get hampered and incomplete in the movie-version but this is not so in this case. Of course, there are some big time cutting in the story, mainly in background descriptions and subplots that are not essential to the main story. However, the writers and directors have still managed to capture the essence of the story while managing to both keep major subplots and not do an movie that go on forever. By some quick scenes, cuts and hints the audience is easily able to put together a complete and fascinating story. Nice work.The story in itself is a version of the classic little guy from nowhere fighting the big system that keep to protect themselves and their profits no matter what. It is a long struggle for poor Baylor but the journey is eventful and entertaining to follow, as new turns and subplots appear and resolve. Damon does an good but not great work with his character, DeVito instead does a really good job with his slightly minor role as Shillet. Th opposition is lead by a Drummond, which Voight portraits with skill even if he as Damon does not bring the performance to any great heights. The real credit here should go to the people in charge of casting along with the director. Damon as Baylor, Voight as Drummond, Danes as Kelly Riker (the beaten girl) and Whitworth (as Donnie Ray Black, the sick son) is very good choices for those characters, both in physical appearances and acting performances. Even Danny Glover (uncredited?) does a nice role (without sending out any Lethal Weapon wibes, nice) out of the presiding judge (a role rather cut in the movie compared to the book). The ace is however DeVito as Shillet. Perfect choice.So, if you like criminal drama, with some traces of action and comedy, this is a movie for you. And if you like the movie and haven't read the book, I strongly recommend that you do so as the story will evolve even more. And if you have read the book but not seen the movie, do not be afraid to do so, you will not be disappointed (even if some surprises might already be known to you). Enjoy the nice acting instead.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 August 2004","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  ** Here might be spoilers **Young lawyer-student Rudy Baylor about to become a real lawyer gets involved with some shady businessmen and involved in a case with some rather poor parents fighting an insurance company, over the treatment and insurance claim of their fatally ill son.

Yea, I agree he was no Marlon Brando or William Holden and he never shed a tear(that I recall) but he was a real man. He never appeared to be acting, but merely being himself. That was the appeal of him. He never claimed nor acted like he was different from you or me.

The two things to remember when watching this are 1) It's a fantasy-a whimsical story that reminded me a lot of The three musketeers and 2) Some of the rather corny dialogue that appeared to be just thrown in, was, in my opinion probably there on purpose. This wasn't a movie that took itself to seriously. I don't think that the makers made this expecting blockbuster audiences and multiple Oscar nominations, nor should they have. But this movie has a peculiar charm about it, a kind of whimsical escapism that throws you back to the time of Lords and ladies, Knights, sword fighting and glamor! It's a fun movie and certainly worth a night's rental though I doubt I'd have paid to see it in the theater-if I'd even known about it when it came out.The main negatives MUCH to slow a buildup during the first half hour-after that time passes very quickly but the first 20 minutes at least, really weren't very enjoyable for me and could have been made to flow with the rest of the movie better and 2)My best friend brought this up and I agree. lady Jocelyn played very prettily and well actually, by Shannon sossoman just didn't come off as a very nice person. It was difficult to like her. My best friend LOVES this movie and had told me about it before we watched a bit and this was one of the observations she had noted and I agree. Although toward the end, I wound up liking her a bit more, she didn't impress me as being a very deep person unlike many of the other colorful characters. Still, Ms. Sossoman is one of the most beautiful actresses I've ever seen and The Lady Jocelyn brought a Certain color and glamor to the movie that would have been lacking without her so I guess it was alright.POSITIVES Great-NEVER dull sword fighting-if your not into sword fighting don't worry-they don't get in your face with that-the sword fighting sequences are never long enough to get boring. The surprisingly touching moments-especially when father and son are reunited-yes I did cry at that!!!!The thrilling sequence involving a certain prince and a pardon that absolutely made the movie. Who is the actor who played the prince? He should be a household name.All in all, I would give this a 7.5 and say it's a pretty good, FUN movie-a good summer's rental choice. Just make sure your in the mood, lords and ladies, for this piece of fun and fantasy when you pop it in to your television!

Someone once said that movies with these kind of themes (similar to Fight Club and in the 80s, Repo Man and Suburbia) would probably be best understood by Generation Xers, despised by the Baby Boomers, and misunderstood by the Millenias. I think this is true. To some, Enid may appear like an unnecessarily bitter girl. The outsider. But to others, they may share the perception that Enid is on the inside looking out and justifiably ridicules what has become of things. In fact, Enid is your modern Holden Caufield or like the main character, Clay, of Less Than Zero (the book, not the movie). Only, those characters who model Holden, are funny cynics in this movie.'Ghost World' is more unusual, too, because it is the rare story of female escapism. Most always, novels and films alike, our protagonist is a male (see the examples above), no matter what the situation. The only other I can remember was the main character, Anna, of the 1998 indie 'Whatever.' Although, she was more disillusioned by percieved failures rather than by the false character of society.The story of Ghost World is about two girls who graduate high school. Their plans, ordained long prior to graduation, change afterwards along with everything else. Thora Birch is Enid, the main character of our story, and the one who is most defiant of structure. Because, if you think of structure as what society has created, and she doesn't like what people have become (most people), be they superficial or ignorant--I'm not sure how to describe her father--or whatever, then Enid would rather defy that structure as much as possible. She is so deadset in her defiance, that she has everything and everyone molded into a particular position. And as the things around her change following graduation, so to does the positions of those around her. Familiarity is out and to Enid, those around her are giving in to the structure, to the things she hates.Rebecca (Scarlett Johnson), the monotone best friend of Enid who seems to be cynical (and quite amusingly in expressing it), though not as much as Enid. After graduation, she tries to stick with Enid's plans of finding an apartment together. Only, with Enid's refusal, they tend to drift apart. Rebecca is, in a way, growing up while Enid is trying so desperately to hang on to something so familiar and essentially, trying to defy change. Rebecca, for example, gets a job at a coffeehouse (where all the phonies flock, too). And so forth. She may not be giving in, but to Enid, she is.In fact, Rebecca and Enid drift further apart with the arrival of a hapless dufus named Seymour (the awesome Steve Buscemi), who first enters the picture when Enid and Rebecca call him pretending to be a long-lost blonde that he was looking for through the personal ads. Seymour eventually becomes good friends with Rebecca, having that main characteristic in common they're both outsiders to the complacent and mundane mainstream. Seymour is caught up in a time warp sort of. His fascination is the ragtime period of the 20s. He is an avid collector of ragtime record classics. His apartment, his taste in music, everything is similar to Enid in that he completely feels like he, too, is in a Ghost World.But, gradually as the movie goes along, Enid can't defy change and familiarity as much as she'd like to. Rebecca starts showing up less as Enid spends more time with Seymour. Seymour gets himself a girlfriend, who is mainstream, and tries to impress some of that on him. Other things, too, like the man who seems to be waiting for the bus that never comes but one day, it does. Enid's father starts dating an ex-girlfriend that Enid didn't like. Things gradually become more and more out of control for her. And she seeks escapism that really has turned into a Ghost World. Only one for her and no one else.This is a movie that really makes its point well (although that's pretty easy) about how Enid and Rebecca (to some extent) and even Seymour view the world. For example, Illeana Douglas, who plays Enid's art teacher, appears like a pretentious person (and art was a good example to use). Look at her 'Mirror Father Mirror' video. Don't ask if that's art. Ask what's the point? And also, what's the point to most of what Douglass's character has to say to her class. Look at the 50s restaraunt that the friends go to Wowsville. Where, included in your authentic 50s diner experience is booming rap music and a waiter with a haircut like Wierd Al Yankovic's. At the bar that Enid and Seymour go to, a group of white guys in a band get up on stage and introduce their songs as the real blues experience. Nevermind that they're a bunch of white guys singing about cotton picking. There's the annoying girl from their high school who shows up every once in a while. There's the situation with Enid and the Coons Chicken\/Church's Chicken sign where everyone was so politically correct, that they didn't even want to consider what the sign was about and asked to have it removed from the museum. There are so many examples that work well in this story. It is really a terrific movie.Ghostworld is based on the comic book by Daniel Clowes, who also wrote the screenplay.

Most always, novels and films alike, our protagonist is a male (see the examples above), no matter what the situation. The only other I can remember was the main character, Anna, of the 1998 indie 'Whatever.' Although, she was more disillusioned by percieved failures rather than by the false character of society.The story of Ghost World is about two girls who graduate high school. Their plans, ordained long prior to graduation, change afterwards along with everything else. Thora Birch is Enid, the main character of our story, and the one who is most defiant of structure. Because, if you think of structure as what society has created, and she doesn't like what people have become (most people), be they superficial or ignorant--I'm not sure how to describe her father--or whatever, then Enid would rather defy that structure as much as possible. She is so deadset in her defiance, that she has everything and everyone molded into a particular position. And as the things around her change following graduation, so to does the positions of those around her. Familiarity is out and to Enid, those around her are giving in to the structure, to the things she hates.Rebecca (Scarlett Johnson), the monotone best friend of Enid who seems to be cynical (and quite amusingly in expressing it), though not as much as Enid. After graduation, she tries to stick with Enid's plans of finding an apartment together. Only, with Enid's refusal, they tend to drift apart. Rebecca is, in a way, growing up while Enid is trying so desperately to hang on to something so familiar and essentially, trying to defy change. Rebecca, for example, gets a job at a coffeehouse (where all the phonies flock, too). And so forth. She may not be giving in, but to Enid, she is.In fact, Rebecca and Enid drift further apart with the arrival of a hapless dufus named Seymour (the awesome Steve Buscemi), who first enters the picture when Enid and Rebecca call him pretending to be a long-lost blonde that he was looking for through the personal ads. Seymour eventually becomes good friends with Rebecca, having that main characteristic in common they're both outsiders to the complacent and mundane mainstream. Seymour is caught up in a time warp sort of. His fascination is the ragtime period of the 20s. He is an avid collector of ragtime record classics. His apartment, his taste in music, everything is similar to Enid in that he completely feels like he, too, is in a Ghost World.But, gradually as the movie goes along, Enid can't defy change and familiarity as much as she'd like to. Rebecca starts showing up less as Enid spends more time with Seymour. Seymour gets himself a girlfriend, who is mainstream, and tries to impress some of that on him. Other things, too, like the man who seems to be waiting for the bus that never comes but one day, it does. Enid's father starts dating an ex-girlfriend that Enid didn't like. Things gradually become more and more out of control for her. And she seeks escapism that really has turned into a Ghost World. Only one for her and no one else.This is a movie that really makes its point well (although that's pretty easy) about how Enid and Rebecca (to some extent) and even Seymour view the world. For example, Illeana Douglas, who plays Enid's art teacher, appears like a pretentious person (and art was a good example to use). Look at her 'Mirror Father Mirror' video. Don't ask if that's art. Ask what's the point? And also, what's the point to most of what Douglass's character has to say to her class. Look at the 50s restaraunt that the friends go to Wowsville. Where, included in your authentic 50s diner experience is booming rap music and a waiter with a haircut like Wierd Al Yankovic's. At the bar that Enid and Seymour go to, a group of white guys in a band get up on stage and introduce their songs as the real blues experience. Nevermind that they're a bunch of white guys singing about cotton picking. There's the annoying girl from their high school who shows up every once in a while. There's the situation with Enid and the Coons Chicken\/Church's Chicken sign where everyone was so politically correct, that they didn't even want to consider what the sign was about and asked to have it removed from the museum. There are so many examples that work well in this story. It is really a terrific movie.Ghostworld is based on the comic book by Daniel Clowes, who also wrote the screenplay. If this is your kind of story, I highly recommend watching it. Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson, and Steve Buscemi were perfect.But I wonder, what is green symbolic of here? Green is used in nearly every scene?

Some of the humour in the film also manages to be quite dark, such as the part where Jack is on a radio show, debating with his rival; who puts the phone down in the middle of the debate, to which Jack responds with laughter over the way that his rival has dropped out of the debate. Only to find he has suffered a heart attack. Also of note is the way that the film is very American, too American, in fact; shown by the way that the characters sing American songs, and talk highly of the country, it's almost sickly, but it works in the satirist content of the movie. The script does, however, become a little over the top at times, and it feels like extra bits are being added in to make the it seem like more is going on, and I feel that the movie would be more efficient if the script has been trimmed a little; but it's a small criticism, and the movie runs smoothly enough.Aside from John Travolta, who gives one of the best performances of his career in this movie, the rest of the cast is good too, and includes performances from Emma Thompson, who makes a great leading lady as Susan Stanton, Kathy Bates; who is gratuitously over the top in her usual electric style, as well as Adrian Lester, an English man that is without doubt the most 'American' character in the movie, and finally; Maura Tierney, who was in the background for a lot of the film but still managed to make an impression as one of the campaign helpers.
