So much detail has been put into this deep Mississippi tale of mischief, both in the sets and in the acting. Yet it all has the vaguely self-conscious feel to it that says Look at me! Isn't this a great performance? (a dubious quality some critics have dubbed the Streep factor).A relaxing afternoon in the cinema no less. Certain details are revealed at the end but by then does the audience really care? Not all of them - it had too much of a made with big bucks and check out the understatement look about it. There are a great many very creative directors about - Altman used to be one of them.
