I watched Superman for the effects, thinking about it's creation in 1978. I was impressed. The models near the end of the Hoover Dam as it breaks were good, some of the model houses lacked good visual agreement with the mandatorily full scale water. The flying was alright considering the new for the movie techniques used. The running was really neat, despite being so simple. The helicopter scene was incredible. Aside from it looking amazing on the fantasy side, there were real things you never would have guessed were fake in that scene. Ah, but the opening credits. What a breakthrough. Their amazing dynamics were achieved with CGI. The Krypton models were okay, composite shots with Krypton was good, glowing suits and rings were neat, F.O.S. was good,Spaceship was alright, G.G. Bridge was good, explosions great, teleportation neat, Phantom Zone Amazing, and the list goes on. The movie was good too.
