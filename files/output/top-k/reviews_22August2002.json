But if you've seen the previous two Austin Powers films, it seems like déjà-vû.  Much of the comedy is too similar to 'Austin Powers International Man of Mystery' and 'Austin Powers The Spy who Shagged Me'.  The Asteroid that resembles 'big juicy melons' is but one example of a gag has lost its originality.Austin Powers is a parody of James Bond (but for copyright reasons, it isn't; just like the monster in 'Goldmember' that looks like Godzilla, but isn't).  Why does James Bond's films appear fresh after so many movies, yet Austin Powers' appear stale, after only three releases?  Probably because of the characters.  Each Bond movie had a different enemy, but it's always Powers against Dr Evil, and his henchmen.

For example-in THE PATRIOT his son dies, so he seeks revenge on the soldier who killed him, and in BRAVEHEART his wife dies. This is the Righteous anger that Mel Gibson usually uses on screen in these films, and while I understand WE WERE SOLDIERS is very true to the facts, I think Mel could've done some more emotional driven scenes-HOWEVER... I still really liked the film. There were a few parts that dragged out, but overall WE WERE SOLDIERS is an excellent achievment. For those who say too much violence is in this- I personally think it's important to have violence in truth based war films. Pearl Harbor was a disgrace aiming for a PG-13 rating. WE WERE SOLDIERS honors those dead soldiers who died in battle, by using realistic violence, and I personally think it payed off in the end. Sometimes by the sets they used in the film you could tell were just being flashed with light for explosion effects at night, but this did not matter to me.

Like in an early scene with animal cages all around, it really sounded like we were in the midst of all that commotion. Also, later when a large fly was buzzing around the lab, I could sense it to my right, then behind me, then to my left, then back to the front as it circled. The extras include a fascinating look at how the special effects were done. Which, incidentally, are marvelous to look at.While the effects rate 8 to 10, the story ityself is probably a 2 or a 3.  The small group of scientists, working in an underground lab in DC for the government, are developing a technique to make animals invisible, to eventually be used on people for covert military operations. Kevin Bacon is the leader of the group, and an unconventional person to boot. He decides to try the technique on himself first. Invisible, he only does dastardly things, molesting one of his team while she sleeps, killing a dog in anger, and later entering an apartment and raping a woman. When the restoring serum fails, and he soon figures out he is doomed to a life like that, he gets desperate.Knowing that his team members will report him, he sets out to systematically eliminate each. He succeeds except for his ex-girl (Elizabeth Shue) and her new boyfriend (Josh Brolin) who get the best of him in a fiery elevator shaft.

Fellowship Of The Ring contains awesome fx's, animations, graphics, music, costumes, casting, post production etc. Peter Jacksons directing surprised me totally. It was a huge risk to take this scale of picture to direct. Something about perfectinism - Brian called the filming crew back to New Zealand after watching the rough version of LOTR II. The fighting sequences were too lame and had to film again. I think it's good news because only thing that bothered me in LOTR I was the lack of blood. I can't wait the next to come...!!!
