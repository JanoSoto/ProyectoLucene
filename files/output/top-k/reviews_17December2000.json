The cold, lifeless reading of the script by it's main characters doesn't do anything to help it at all, and had it not been for some life out of members of the supporting cast, I likely would have walked out.The storyline consists of a self-centered, arrogant ad exec (Affleck) who becomes marooned at O'Hare Airport during a snowstorm.  While tossing a few back at the airport lounge, he meets Mimi (Natasha Henstridge) who's trying to get back to Dallas after a business trip, and a quiet television writer named Greg Janello (Tony Goldwin), who's on his way back to LA after bombing with his first play.In a sudden burst of kindness, (more centered on sleeping with Mimi than actual kindness) Buddy (Affleck) gives Greg his first class ticket on flight 82 so that Greg can get home to his family that much sooner.  The flight crashes and Buddy is faced with the feeling that he dodged a bullet but somehow contributed to Greg's death.  This spirals down into the predictable bout of alcoholism and rehab at a posh Palm Springs clinic.  Once out, Buddy decides to look up Greg's widow, Abby (Paltrow), to make amends for his guilt.From there, it only gets worse, as Buddy falls in love with Abby and he deals with her demons and her children (excellently played by Alex D. Linz and David Dorfman), but never telling her about the reason he's actually around.Ben Affleck looks like he's sleepwalking through the role of Buddy, never even attempting to add any feeling or heart to Buddy.  Maybe that was the point initally, but once he tracks down Abby at least a courtesy effort should have been made to show remorse or emotion at all.  Affleck has an annoying habit of playing to the level of his material, and since this script was junk, so was his performance.Gwenyth Paltrow is equally dull as Abby, as she clearly seems to be wishing some other leading man was Buddy, as opposed to ex-boyfriend Affleck.  This woman is easily the most overrated actress in Hollywood, neither glamourous or talented, and finally shows it here with the eternally frumpy hairstyles and cold complexion.  Her emotional breakdown over the loss of her husband is laughable.Johnny Galecki (Roseanne) plays Seth, Buddy's new assistant.  A recovering alcoholic himself, they truly get off on the wrong foot in the men's room, but eventually end up smoothing over their testy relationship towards the end.  An enjoyable character and should have been given more screen time, perhaps mentoring Buddy's AA progress.Another good secondary character was Natasha Henstridge's Mimi.  Not a lot of depth, but she seemed to believe in her role and gave the feeling of an old friend that you've known for years.  She figures in the way this one ends up, and you're actually surprised it doesn't happen sooner in this snore-fest.Bounce is neither romantic nor dramatic, just two of Hollywood's overhyped wunderkinds trying to show us how they think they can be the next legendary screen couple.  Do us all a favor, give it up.  You're a long long way from legendary, and as long as you continue to buy your own hype, that won't change.1 out of 5  ","genre":null},{"date":"17 December 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Bounce is by and far one of the dullest, most depressing romantic movies I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through.

Many believe the film is nothing more than a test of a person's morality.  Many believe that the film promotes violence in a negative way on young modern day culture.  I believe the film promotes the ability to simply think of the darkness that lies beneath the human soul.A Clockwork Orange is the story of a teenage criminal named Alex who learns the hard way that you reap of what you sow.  The film sets you up so that when Alex commits his crimes you feel rather humored or jolly.  I, myself would blame this on the music.  The music provides a sense of repulsiveness and therefore allowing the members of the audience to know right from wrong in theory.  The music I think is used to allow the audience member to feel and live in Alex's obvious state of euphoria when committing these crimes.  But, when Alex is captured and forced into non-violence, he is let out of prison after two years of what he calls a human zoo onto the streets he once destroyed.  We cannot feel nothing but empathy for our character as every one in his life rejects and attacks him.  The reason we feel this empathy is because the emotion is finally released onto the story, and I felt that the character had reclaimed his humanity by being hurt the same way he once hurt others.Another reason I believe that we can feel empathy is because of the balance of anger and happiness.  When Alex is raping or bashing another person, he feels happy, unlike the very people who seek revenge upon our lead character.  They are not happy when they are avenging their lost dignity.  Instead, they are mad.  Anger has consumed them and caused them to lash out at a defenseless man who has lost it all.  Of all of the violent scenes in the film, of all terrifying ideas that come into play, only one scene actually takes the sticks out when I think of A Clockwork Orange.  The scene is when Alex is let out of prison and goes home to greet his parents for the first time in two years.  Here, he consciously learns that what he had done was wrong and must pay for his sins.  As the background violin score begins to play, I could not help but nearly cry as he began to.  This scene is arguably the most powerful scene and always I feel touched by the humanity that courses through it.  I love A Clockwork Orange just because of this scene and how it can make all the bad in the film forgettable for just one moment of clarity.The movie does examine the darkness that flows throughout the human mind.  Life has two paths; Love or hate.  Alex chose hate and got exactly in return what he had thrown onto others. Love is beneficial towards the evil aspect in a way of exchange as Alex slowly learns.

I wonder why?I don't know why The Replacements failed at the box office. Keanu Reeves still, aparently, does not have the box office clout to carry a film. The Matrix succeeded because it was a classic and people recognised that. It was not a star vehicle. The Replacements is an ensemble film that, I think, should appeal to a more mature audience. Unfortunately, most film goers in the summer are kids. I suspect that marketing is the major reason why this film did not make the $200 million plus it richly deserved.It is a very special film indeed that conveys the feeling that the actors had an absolute ball making it. I'd like to say thank you to Howard Deutch and his Gridiron Dirty Dozen. What a blast!

Bjork's performance was great, and Selma was one of the cutest, most lovable characters ever made. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see her become a victim of her illness, her determination, and her hard work. However, the moment that she started to become exploited by others, it turned horrid. Bill's actions were so extreme that it was  laughable, as they tried to make the absolute worst possible scenario. As her situation escalated, it just seemed more and more unrealistic, and I couldn't help but see her character turning into Edward Scissorhands (refusing to break her promise, despite how bad a situations she was in). Now don't get me wrong - I did think it was sad, but only when her downfall was because of HER weaknesses (such as the loss of her job) and not the weaknesses of others (Bill), and I quickly lost all emotional attachment when things turned really bad.Another problem that began there was the music. I absolutely love Bjork, and I've been singing (and longing to dance to) her first two songs from this movie for days. Her first song, CVALDA, appropriately fit in as we saw how she escaped the monotony and stress of the massive workload that she undertook, as well as being a damn fine song. Similarly, the train song, I'VE SEEN IT ALL, showed her longing to escape from her responsibility, and be swept into a romantic life which she can only dream about. I found that every song after these, however, didn't fit in, as she began to LIVE her life as a musical, instead of  WISH for her life to BECOME a musical. I didn't see any reason for her to break out into song in the courtroom, or after her encounter with Bill. Maybe she was trying to console herself that everything was OK (after all, nothing terrible ever happens in musicals), but it still seemed inappropriate and the songs came on a bit too thick and fast.So what am I trying to say? The first half of this movie was absolutely amazing, but you can draw a line where it turns bad as she comes home to discover an empty lolly tin. But the songs were great, and the cinematography even better. If only it wasn't for the stupidity and unoriginality of the plot in the second half......

Griswold, Jr., who is arguably the best, and most memorable, character he's ever created for the silver screen.  It's summer vacation time, and Clark has ordered a new sports model station wagon to drive the family from Chicago to Los Angeles; their destination  The one and only `Walleyworld' amusement park in beautiful Southern Cal.  But things begin on a somewhat dubious note when the car Clark ordered hasn't arrived, and he has to settle for the `Family Truckster,' which the salesman (Eugene Levy) tells him is superior to the one he ordered and, moreover, is just the vehicle for driving the `whole tribe' across the country.  And it's only the beginning of a vacation the Griswolds (as well as the audience) will never forget. \tWorking from a screenplay by John Hughes that is clever and filled with subtle humor, Ramis also uses the natural abilities of Chase and the rest of his cast to full advantage, punctuating the wittiness of the script with some broad strokes of physical comedy that blend well within the framework of the story.  The project was in good hands with Ramis, who knows the territory and keeps it all flowing with a good pace and excellent timing.  He was especially successful with Chase, who in other films has had a tendency at times to wander a bit from the humorous aspects of his characters; but not here.  His `Clark' is right on the money.  Beverly D'Angelo (Ellen Griswold) does a good job as well, in a role that is basically one of playing `straight man' for Chase and his shenanigans.  And they have an on-screen rapport that helps make even their screwiest antics believable. \tIn the four `Vacation' movies, the only parts that had different actors each time were those of the `Griswold Kids,' the best of which were the original, with Anthony Michael Hall as Rusty and Dana Barron as Audrey (the second best were Johnny Galecki and Juliette Lewis in `Christmas Vacation').  They round out what is, somewhat surprisingly (for all of their comical situations and circumstances) a fully `functional' family anchored by Clark, who always starts out, at least, with only the best intentions.  Also outstanding, in the role he reprises in the third and fourth installments of the series as well, is Randy Quaid as the inimitable `Cousin Eddie,' a relative the likes of which can be found in just about any family anywhere; the cousin nobody wants to claim, whose heart is bigger than his brain.  It's a characterization rooted deeply in Americana, and one you won't forget.   \tThe supporting cast includes Miriam Flynn (Cousin Catherine), Eddie Bracken (Roy Walley), Imogene Coca (Aunt Edna), Brian Doyle-Murray (Kamp Komfort Clerk), James Keach (Motorcycle Cop), Frank McRae (Grover) and John Candy (doing a hilarious turn as Lasky, a Guard at Walleyworld).  A movie for anyone who's ever taken a vacation with the whole family (or even for those who haven't), `National Lampoon's Vacation' is a laugh-filled, upbeat and highly entertaining movie that, between the laughter, will make you think about a few things (like verifying the schedules of an amusement park) the next time you start planning the family vacation.  This may not be the `perfect' comedy, but it comes awfully close; and if the number of laughs it gets are any indication, it at least puts it somewhere near the top.

He then uses his ability to sneak into the woman psyche. The first few scenes that open are really nothing and aren't important to the movie. The scene with Marisa Tomei is the first real scene that is important. Nick thinks he's so sly. But when he gets his ability he realizes that the women don't like him. In steps Helen Hunt. She takes Nick's job so he hates her. He uses his ability against her, stealing her ideas and such. Then, a romance builds between the two. The movie is flawed. Very flawed. But the reason that it's good, is because A.) It's funny and B.) Hunt and Gibson has great chemistry. The movie works on two levels. One level for a woman and one level for a man. The woman level works because, well, Mel Gibson's in it doing what he does best. The men take on it, is they can see how women think. How they REALLY feel about you. Of course, this does not apply to most cases because the movie is far fetched. Men will also find it funny. There was an (about) 18 years old male there with his girlfriend. He seemed to enjoy it, as did I.Hunt and Gibson are wonderful, as always. Hunt makes up for Dr. T in this movie. And Mel, well, Mel is always great. So is Hunt, it's just, I don't forgive anyone for Dr. T. Hunt is bright and sophisticated. She has her own way of acting. Unlike other people. She takes the character and transforms them into people you can really start to like. Gibson is always enjoyable in comedies. And women just love those baby blues. When the two are on screen it's magic. The way they flirt back and forth works so well because the two have great chemistry. I'm not going to go into the details of how it was flawed. Except, it IS a little too long, but that's ok. The way some of the women think in this movie is hilarious. Especially Loretta Devine (Urban Legend & Urban Legends Final Cut) and Delta Burke (the new show DAG).The movie is wonderful, except for the many flaws, I have a feeling this will be liked among women (definately) and men. **Note What Women Want opened the same day as Dude, Where's My Car?

This is the word I would choose to describe watching this film. It really is awful. If you go into this film to see a slick, professional action film in the mould of The Matrix or Spottiswoode's own Tomorrow Never Dies then you will be disappointed. If you go into this film expecting a political insight into the problems and ethical pitfalls of human cloning you will be disappointed. The only way you will get anything out of this film is if you go in, as I did, expecting nothing. Then, maybe you will not be so disappointed. What could have been an intelligent insight into one of the most exciting scientific breakthroughs in recent years is instead turned into a stilted and repetitive excuse for a film. The cloning aspect of the film is wasted and used simply to allow Arnie to kill the same people over and over again, while spewing out corny one-liners that even Bond would be ashamed of. It reminded me of the way the masks were used too often in MI2 as a plot cop-out tactic.The only time the morals of cloning are ever really touched upon is in the scenes with Robert Duvall and his wife. While we're on the subject, a quick word about Mr Duvall. In this film he stands out like a diamond in a trashcan and even with his limited part acts everyone else off the screen. He's the only actor (alongside his wife) in the film to bring any kind of emotion to the part, its just a shame he had to do it in such a bad film.Now I know some people will say, `but its only an action film' and they'd be right. But what they would have failed to notice is what a poor action film it is. Arnie looks too old to do this kind of thing anymore and the `innocent man wound up in a conspiracy and fighting for his life' character really doesn't suit him. He should go back to the roles were he keeps the talking to a minimum and cranks up the killing as high as it'll go. He really is quite painful to watch - not least when he is running about. And if you thought that one Arnie was bad enough, imagine two of them on screen at once. Geeeez.The action scenes themselves were boring and repetitive, consisting of a series of shootouts mixed in with some r-c helicopters. No imaginative set-pieces or death-defying stunts, nothing. This would have been acceptable if they were an aside to the main `plot' of the film but his is simply not the case. I just sat there waiting for Robert Duvall to come back on.Aside from all this, the film does throws up an unexpected treat and possibly the most hideous creation ever committed to celluloid - the Sim-Pal. Looking like a cross between Chucky and the girl from the Exorcist on a bad day, it wouldn't be unfair to say that it sent shivers down my spine and provided an all too brief highlight in the film.After sitting through the film you could be forgiven for wanting a nice tidy ending but one does not appear.
