In other words, captivate your attention for the span of the movie's runtime. Great movies do this and something else &#x96; they inspire you and make you think; maybe even enlighten. That's the power of the art of film. My wife and I just watched 1999's Instinct and it does this, which explains my high rating.THE PLOT Anthropologist Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) goes missing in Africa for a couple of years; when he is found living with gorillas he kills a couple of rangers and injures others. After a year in prison in Africa, where he refuses to speak, he is extradited to a Florida prison and put in the mental ward. A young psychiatrist, Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.), is assigned his case to see if he can get him to speak and learn what really happened in Africa. Meanwhile Powell's daughter (Maura Tierney) anticipates reconciling with her father, IF Theo can get through to him.There are some peripheral characters, but that's the gist of the story. Some people criticize it as a mix of Gorillas in the Mist and One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, which is only valid on a surface level. I've seen the latter film (a great film) and Instinct stands on its own; in fact, it's quite unique, which is a sign of greatness. The movie stands or falls on Hopkins and Cuba Jr making the characters and their story come alive and seem real to the viewer. They succeeded for my wife and me. Within 20 minutes we found ourselves absorbed into the story and the characters.Some people, like Roger Ebert, criticized that the film takes on too many topics or messages, but I never got this impression, nor did my wife. There are the main themes&#x97;the limitations of freedom in conventional society and the abuse of controllers (or takers)&#x97;and there are a few subthemes, like the flaws of our prisons and mental institutions. The film never confused us or gave the impression that it cut off more than it could chew. If you appreciate films like Grand Canyon and One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest you'll probably value instinct. Some criticized one aspect of the climax, but it happens. There are documented examples in the USA and all over the world. Also, keep in mind that Powell was imprisoned in the mental ward of the prison, not the maximum security area.Is the story contrived to some degree? Of course it is; all movies are. Filmmakers have to tell a story and make their points within a limited time frame -- usually around two hours -- and so there are always contrived elements, coincidences, etc. The trick is to pull it off without seeming too phony or forced, which is sometimes hard to do and it takes good actors. Thankfully, Instinct does a respectable job on this front, perhaps mainly because it has a few great actors, although some viewers may roll their eyes at how the ace of diamonds subplot is wrapped up. Regardless, it's in the area of ideas that Instinct towers above most movies. BOTTOM LINE Instinct is a psychological drama\/thriller that entertains but also makes you think and ponder How free are we really in society? Are you a giver or a taker? A blesser or an abuser? A liberator or a controller? How can you be freer? How can you escape the manipulations and shackles of others, of society, of government? How can you walk free of the game?

It has good parts and bad, mostly positive in my opinion but I do really really think that some will hugely dislike this. It even has good acting by the main man, but he can't work on his own and is let down by all the others working alongside him, in the end I felt it was strongly kind of OK, and here is why below.The story isn't the bad thing about this film, it is fine, maybe reminiscent of a Connery or Moore Bond with it's hugely improbable overtones, but yet it still holds well and lots of fun can actually be had with this. It plays out well and goes at a nice pace, never staying in one place for too long as to not completely bore the viewer. Not all the story is good here, too much ridiculousness plagues this movie and just random gadgets and scenes unneeded really hinder this, and in the end the film is really not near being a good one.Pierce Brosnan is good here, as said ruined by others but he keeps the type of Bond we expect to see form him and he really try's hard with this film. Cast members such as Denise Richards and Sophie Marceau are not bad but don't contribute much to the film and in the end become useless characters, disliked Robert Carlysle as the villain as I felt he didn't put enough in to it and looked unbothered, nevertheless he is still deadly to deal with for Bond. I especially liked Judi Dench, she gets to actually act in action scenes in this rather than just in an office and she brightens the darker scenes with her fantastic humour. It isn't written well really, not terrible but poor and if done better would have made this film maybe just a little better, the world choice of the writers never works and I felt the directors touch could not save this and make it good, it just seemed too over the top. I enjoyed the effects, yet again a step up from previous instalments and the film never seemed to lack effects, they actually make this movie better though. The gadgets are cool and new, obviously quite insane but they can be enjoyed and Brosnan yet again uses them with slick suaveness. The main criticism isn't actually the story, it's the half worked atmosphere that is felt around this film, it just seems too undone and like they wanted to make about a quarter of a film but then decided they couldn't be bothered and just filled the rest of it very very quickly. The acting isn't top notch, it is up to the viewer whether or not this brings the quality of it down but what I will say is that, they don't bring much new or fun, Brosnan left without his wings in a sense.Those who are fans of the Bond franchise should enjoy this, I don't think near as much as films in the past or the future, but can be enjoyed though(I did). If you are less accustomed to the series or Brosnan you may feel this is typical popcorn action in the 90's and hugely different to say Connery or even Daniel Craig. One reason I actually would recommend this to people is that, if you ignore the rest of the cast and just watch Brosnan, he is good and he delivers what you want to see from James Bond.Overall a 6\/10, this is a Strongly Pretty OK movie, not quite OK and far from Good, although it is also far from Poor and you may think I criticised this more than complimented but it generally is Kind of OK. Good fun with this movie can be had, well at least for those who can easily get lost to the charm of Bond and the slick action, otherwise you may not enjoy this so much but I think you will agree with me that Brosnan in no way ruins this, Don't miss this film out if watching them all in order.

The gadgets are cool and new, obviously quite insane but they can be enjoyed and Brosnan yet again uses them with slick suaveness. The main criticism isn't actually the story, it's the half worked atmosphere that is felt around this film, it just seems too undone and like they wanted to make about a quarter of a film but then decided they couldn't be bothered and just filled the rest of it very very quickly. The acting isn't top notch, it is up to the viewer whether or not this brings the quality of it down but what I will say is that, they don't bring much new or fun, Brosnan left without his wings in a sense.Those who are fans of the Bond franchise should enjoy this, I don't think near as much as films in the past or the future, but can be enjoyed though(I did). If you are less accustomed to the series or Brosnan you may feel this is typical popcorn action in the 90's and hugely different to say Connery or even Daniel Craig. One reason I actually would recommend this to people is that, if you ignore the rest of the cast and just watch Brosnan, he is good and he delivers what you want to see from James Bond.Overall a 6\/10, this is a Strongly Pretty OK movie, not quite OK and far from Good, although it is also far from Poor and you may think I criticised this more than complimented but it generally is Kind of OK. Good fun with this movie can be had, well at least for those who can easily get lost to the charm of Bond and the slick action, otherwise you may not enjoy this so much but I think you will agree with me that Brosnan in no way ruins this, Don't miss this film out if watching them all in order.

It has good parts and bad, mostly positive in my opinion but I do really really think that some will hugely dislike this. It even has good acting by the main man, but he can't work on his own and is let down by all the others working alongside him, in the end I felt it was strongly kind of OK, and here is why below.The story isn't the bad thing about this film, it is fine, maybe reminiscent of a Connery or Moore Bond with it's hugely improbable overtones, but yet it still holds well and lots of fun can actually be had with this. It plays out well and goes at a nice pace, never staying in one place for too long as to not completely bore the viewer. Not all the story is good here, too much ridiculousness plagues this movie and just random gadgets and scenes unneeded really hinder this, and in the end the film is really not near being a good one.Pierce Brosnan is good here, as said ruined by others but he keeps the type of Bond we expect to see form him and he really try's hard with this film. Cast members such as Denise Richards and Sophie Marceau are not bad but don't contribute much to the film and in the end become useless characters, disliked Robert Carlysle as the villain as I felt he didn't put enough in to it and looked unbothered, nevertheless he is still deadly to deal with for Bond. I especially liked Judi Dench, she gets to actually act in action scenes in this rather than just in an office and she brightens the darker scenes with her fantastic humour.

Yeah. I thought that his words were some of the most intelligent and insightful that I had ever-ever heard in the genre of Rock'n'Roll (or in any other genre of music, for that matter) since the beginning of time.Now, don't get me wrong here, Waters' lyrics are supremely clever. And it's pretty damn obvious, indeed, that he certainly put some genuine thought into what he said (which is a hell of a lot more than I can say for about 95% of the lyrics of most Pop\/Rock music), but, being the psycho-cynic that I am, there's just one, or two, itty-bitty things that Waters says that irks me off, big time, and I just feel like commenting about them here.First off - I wanna do some beefing about that most famous line of Waters' in The Wall that goes - We don't need no education. We don't need no thought-control. Yeah. I think we all know that one.Now, I don't have any qualms, per se, about Waters saying stuff like that. I mean, he can say that sort of crap all he wants. But, for me, it's one thing for Waters to be telling us all what we 'don't' need - But my problem is - Waters isn't telling us what we 'do' need. He isn't.So, if he goes around telling us that we don't need things like education and thought-control, then I wanna know what he thinks we do need. But Waters never does clue us into what we do need. I mean, he must think that we do need something other than education\/thought-control.And, so, in my opinion, with this 'don't need\/do need' equation being left incomplete, or imbalanced, this renders Waters' words (that I would otherwise consider intelligent) to be completely useless and lame. I find what Waters says to be absolutely unsatisfactory.Now, I realize that this whole complaint of mine may not seem like a big deal to most people - And, in reality it isn't anything to get too excited about - But, all the same, I am now viewing Waters' rants and raves as no frickin' better than the utter crap that he's so adamantly complaining about and so hatefully voicing his disapproval of.And according to Waters - There may be 13 (or whatever) channels of s.h.i.t on the TV to choose from, but that also goes double for the amount of crap that's available on the radio, too, including stations that play Pink Floyd's music.So, let's face it - All-in-All - Waters' words are just another brick in the wall, too.Yeah.By the way - I couldn't help but notice how painfully devoid of humor the movie The Wall was. It's true. I mean, even with The Exorcist there were actually a few moments of levity thrown in between all of the goo and glop. But not so in The Wall.I think that Director Alan Parker, with all of his impressively bleak and dour visions, hopelessly missed the point of a lot of Waters' lyrics.

In the 25 years since its release it has become very dated. It's not dated BADLY, but it has aged more than other films of the period.Corporate slackers Richard and Larry (Ted Mosby prototype Jonathan Silverman and 80s person Andrew McCarthy) discover a $4,000,000 fraud hidden away in the cooked books. Their attempt to impress their boss Bernie Lomax (a lovably smug Terry Kiser) with their find leads to an invitation to his Hampton Island home for a summer weekend of babes, booze, and boats. The duo don't realize that they've stumbled on Bernie's embezzlement scam and that he intends to have them quietly killed by the Mob (the organized crime connections are never fully detailed or understood). Mob Boss Vito instead arranges for Bernie to be killed, thus washing his hands of him.Upon arriving at Bernie's lavish home Richard and Larry discover that he ain't quite breathing and most definitely has ceased living. For a variety of reasons they plot to create the illusion that Bernie is still alive, which proves to be easier done than said as his vacuous, drunken neighbors are more interested in drinking his champagne and mooching parties from him than actually being friends.Despite the dark subject matter Weekend at Bernie's plays it safe for the most part, never pushing past its PG-13 boundaries. The physicality of Kiser's performance is impressive as well as funny. You really do believe he is dead and he's brilliant at keeping a straight face (or a smirking one as he dies during a brief moment of pleasure) while being tossed and thrown around. You wouldn't think that playing a dead body would be hard but Kiser's comic timing and skill really pay off.The production design and flat photography are what date this film so much. Although Ted Kotcheff had Wake in Fright and First Blood on his resume by this point he brings very little visual flair to the film and it looks very TV-ish. The poor score by Andy Summers never seems to work with any scene (I have a feeling that his friend Stewart Copeland would have done a better job) and some of the soundtrack choices grate on the ears.What amazes me the most is that about 90% of the dialogue is (bad) ADR. I assume that the sound guy forgot to switch on the mic or something. I can accept it when it comes to dubbing over several F-bombs to keep the movie family-friendly but you'll be surprised at how often the words simply do not match the lips.Skip the sequel.

The dim-witted, idiotically DUMB duo then come to their senses (or so they think) and head off and reunite this woman with her briefcase. All along the way do some of the most hilarious things happen....one of the greatest and funniest scenes is when Lloyd and Harry, riding along in a sheep-dog designed van, get pulled over by a police officer....what happens is he comes up beside them and says Pullover! and then after saying it a second time Harry says No, it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticing! and of course Lloyd adds in Yeah! Killer boots, man!.After they're actually pulled alongside and they've realised they're needing to stop, the officer sees beer bottles...or at least the leftover, pee-filled bottles that Lloyd filled up. Yes, it happens! He asks for a drink, demanding that Lloyd gives him one over after saying to Lloyd Come on, give me that beer over you little pumpkin-pie hair- cutted freak, c'mon(something along those lines...) and, well yeah, i'll leave you to figure out the rest.All-in-all, funniest film ever made, full of incredible and hilariously- funny scenes that will leave you gasping for air. An incredible film and I cannot wait for the long-awaited sequel Dumb and Dumber To to come out this November! Thank you for reading.

Nevertheless, it's a heckuva sci-fi movie from beginning to end. Frankenheimer pulls out all the stops in his camera work. The angles and effects are weird even for the close-ups, while that hectic bacchanal still has me panting for breath. We're kept off balance the whole time by those angles, which is as it should be. The style fits the material perfectly.Poor Arthur (Randolph). He's a dutiful husband and breadwinner, but he's also terminally bored with his life and wife. It seems he's grown old, even at middle-age. So, now he's ready for the big change the Company provides for a price. Still, he should have known when he signed up that he was in for the wrong kind of rebirth. After all, he first has to go through an infernal steam cloud at the pants presser, then through carcass-strewn meat lockers in a slaughterhouse. It's all this just to get to the Company offices. That should have told him that the price of a new identity would be more hellish than the 30,000 in dollars.But then, what guy wouldn't trade a 45-year old tired mug for Rock Hudson's handsome features and a new chance at life, especially the swinging kind. Okay, so maybe there's something sinister behind the smiling bureaucrats of The Company, especially when Mr. Ruby (Corey) scarfs down the fleshy edibles. But not to worry, they'll fake his death with some poor soul's cadaver and his unexciting former life will be left behind for good. So, after a lot of bloody plastic surgery, Arthur gets his new chance with a handsome new face, reborn now as Tony Wilson (Hudson). Plus he gets to move from his boring old house in the suburbs to where else but swinging Malibu, CA. The Company, it seems, fixes up everything. Then there's that adoring young playmate to help (Jens) him settle in. She's sure a long way from the drab wife he's left behind. Okay, maybe there's something odd about John (Addy), the hovering house servant of his beach cottage. Nonetheless, he waits on Tony's every need, and now Tony can live life as a king.And get a load of those merry- making hippies snaking up the canyon to their wine-soaked retreat that Nora's roped him into. Trouble is you can change a person outwardly, but it's not so easy inwardly. Besides, as Arthur, Tony has a whole lifetime of habits and hang-ups to overcome. So now he just sort of stands there, uptight, amid all the naked wine-stomping bodies. A real party-pooper until playmate Nora strong-arms him into drunken abandon. Now he's got what he thinks he wants, a new swinging life to replace the glum old businessman. At last, life is good, but is it. I'm not surprised the film has a big cult following. On the whole, it's that good. The cast is superb, even Hudson who I suspect gives a career performance. That's along with the Walton's Will Geer as the kindly old head of The Company, his perpetual smile a mask for what turns out to be a Faustian bargain. To me, the movie's final third lacks the kind of clarity that's gone before. But maybe that's as it should be. That way the sinister undercurrents remain clouded in their exact depths.It appears the plot pivots at this point on the question of personal choice, certainly a defining feature of personal fulfillment. But without giving away too much, it seems The Company has engineered everything, right down to guaranteed unhappiness. So the Company program perhaps amounts to a recycling of clients through pre-planned stages that Tony too must go through. The movie doesn't spell out what The Company is really up to; instead, we have to piece things together. I guess my only gripe is with the ending. Frankly, the kicking and screaming may raise the viewer's dread-level, but I think the ending should come as a sudden surprise with kindly old Will Geer looking on.Nonetheless, the movie appears to be an original reworking of the Faustian legend of selling one's soul. But whether taken as a Faustian parable on middle- class discontent or not, it's still a riveting 100-minutes.

Godzilla himself is symbolic of everything horrifying and destructive about the H-bomb, and the toll that it can take on human lives. Masterfully directed by Ishiro Honda (who also co-wrote the screenplay), it's genuinely exciting in its action scenes, with special effects that are pulled off in a respectable way. Honda does begin the film with a jolt, but then takes his time building the story until the inevitable major rampage around the one hour mark. Godzilla is never more entertaining than when Big G is stomping around, but it's also very serious and sobering as well, and the aftermath of the one big set piece is very emotional.It also helps that the human stories are worth watching; the main thread is a love triangle between heroic scientist Ogata (Akira Takarada), the girl he loves, Emiko (Momoko Kochi), and another eminent scientist, Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata). When the enormous lizard of the title emerges from the ocean and annihilates everything in his wake, Emikos' father, Yamane (Takashi Shimura) is called upon to provide expert advice. What Yamane would like to do more than anything is study Godzilla, while Serizawa contrives what could be a possible means of dealing with the problem.Godzilla is truly a force of nature here; he's at his scariest and most bad ass, emitting radioactive mist from his mouth that is capable of setting people and objects on fire. His first reveal in the film is more amusing than anything else, but soon we find out what kind of horrors that he's capable of.

It's all 'cause I found this flick to be a major disappointment.The story is set in Reno, Nevada -The Divorce Capital of the USA.Roz (Monroe) is newly divorced, which explains her reason for being in Reno. (Why else would anyone want to go there?...Oh, yeah, Gambling) And in no less than 5 minutes (straight out of divorce court) Roz has already got 3 drunken, old buzzards (Gable, Clift, Wallach) sniffing and salivating around her like she was a prime piece of meat for them all to gobble up. Each one of these crusty, old vultures is hoping to be the one who gets to tear off the biggest chunk of Roz's lovely, lily-white flesh for his greedy, little self.What a sorry sight these 3 drooling, crotchety, old has-beens make. It's really revolting at times to watch the way they all clamor over Roz. Each one seems to believe himself to be a real prize. A prize that Roz couldn't possibly refuse.I know this sounds incredibly shallow, but this is pretty much the story-line of this movie. It doesn't really get any more involved than this.In a way these 3 crusty, old farts reminded me of a grotesque version of The 3 Stooges (Curly, Larry & Moe), but this time their punch-line is failing, miserably. Gable is, without a doubt, 'King-of-the-Grotesque-Ones' here. I really hated it when it turned out that this wrinkled, bow-legged creep was the one that sweet, young Roz chose to hump with. UGH! Gross-to-the-max!! I don't understand why 3 dashing, young cowboy-romeos couldn't have been chosen to fill the roles of Gable, Clift & Wallach. It certainly would've made this movie a lot easier to digest. And it would have explained why Roz continued to hang out with this bunch.The only time that this flick actually comes to life is in the last 1\/2 hour. If you didn't think that these 3 smiling corpses (Gable, Clift & Wallach) were repulsive enough, they prove themselves to be even lower than dirt at this point.They head up into the mountains (with the unsuspecting Roz) and there they round up a family of 6 wild horses (including a magnificent stallion and a beautiful colt). And, why have they done this?? Well, get this!!! They trap these marvelous creatures to sell them at 15 cents a pound to some heartless animal-food manufacturer who'll slaughter them and then grind them up into dog food.Can you believe it???......And you wondered why I called this movie review Meet the MisFARTS!!???......Now you know why! What makes this movie worth the price of admission is Roz's realization that these 3 old dudes are in reality nothing but savage scoundrels, who would sell their own grandmother's dentures for a buck, if they could. Roz's response is excellent.But, unfortunately, a happy ending was tacked on to this film and I could no longer look at Roz as being above these 3 jerks. No way. The happy, crappy ending pretty much reduced sweet Roz to their lower-than-low level in no time flat.

(Why else would anyone want to go there?...Oh, yeah, Gambling) And in no less than 5 minutes (straight out of divorce court) Roz has already got 3 drunken, old buzzards (Gable, Clift, Wallach) sniffing and salivating around her like she was a prime piece of meat for them all to gobble up. Each one of these crusty, old vultures is hoping to be the one who gets to tear off the biggest chunk of Roz's lovely, lily-white flesh for his greedy, little self.What a sorry sight these 3 drooling, crotchety, old has-beens make. It's really revolting at times to watch the way they all clamor over Roz. Each one seems to believe himself to be a real prize. A prize that Roz couldn't possibly refuse.I know this sounds incredibly shallow, but this is pretty much the story-line of this movie. It doesn't really get any more involved than this.In a way these 3 crusty, old farts reminded me of a grotesque version of The 3 Stooges (Curly, Larry & Moe), but this time their punch-line is failing, miserably. Gable is, without a doubt, 'King-of-the-Grotesque-Ones' here. I really hated it when it turned out that this wrinkled, bow-legged creep was the one that sweet, young Roz chose to hump with. UGH! Gross-to-the-max!! I don't understand why 3 dashing, young cowboy-romeos couldn't have been chosen to fill the roles of Gable, Clift & Wallach. It certainly would've made this movie a lot easier to digest. And it would have explained why Roz continued to hang out with this bunch.The only time that this flick actually comes to life is in the last 1\/2 hour. If you didn't think that these 3 smiling corpses (Gable, Clift & Wallach) were repulsive enough, they prove themselves to be even lower than dirt at this point.They head up into the mountains (with the unsuspecting Roz) and there they round up a family of 6 wild horses (including a magnificent stallion and a beautiful colt). And, why have they done this?? Well, get this!!! They trap these marvelous creatures to sell them at 15 cents a pound to some heartless animal-food manufacturer who'll slaughter them and then grind them up into dog food.Can you believe it???......And you wondered why I called this movie review Meet the MisFARTS!!???......Now you know why! What makes this movie worth the price of admission is Roz's realization that these 3 old dudes are in reality nothing but savage scoundrels, who would sell their own grandmother's dentures for a buck, if they could. Roz's response is excellent.But, unfortunately, a happy ending was tacked on to this film and I could no longer look at Roz as being above these 3 jerks. No way. The happy, crappy ending pretty much reduced sweet Roz to their lower-than-low level in no time flat.

George Stevens message about guns has fallen on deaf ears for too long. Stevens had covered World War Two as film-maker and knew the reality of guns. He was disturbed by how they were being depicted in films &#x96; particularly Westerns. Guns were being glorified and their impact on the human body trivialized. In Shane the six-shooter is shown to be a brutal and cowardly instrument of death that even the good guy Shane cannot logically defend by claiming it to be a tool like any other that is as good or bad as the man using it. Jean Arthur's character, Marian, replies that everyone would be better off if there wasn't a single gun in the valley and adds the rider &#x96; even yours. Marian knows that it is the gun culture that is dangerous and that arguments about good guys and bad guys miss the point. Stevens does a great job of re-sensitizing his audience to the brutal nature of the handgun by emphasizing its sound. The film's soundtrack is kept at rather low levels until Shane demonstrates his ability with his gun and then the gunshots leap out at us. Whilst Little Joey is thrilled, the adult Marian and hopefully the adults in the audience are left shocked by the noise. The sound, of course, has been exaggerated but it is as if Stevens is doing this in order to emphasize how the popgun effects of previous westerns have minimized the effects of guns. I don't think that there is a more brutal depiction of a gun murder than that of Stonewall Torrey by Jack Palance as the smirking assassin, Jack Wilson. Again, it is probable that a bullet could not throw a man backwards as violently as was Torry but I am pretty sure that Stevens was emphasizing how the balletic fall forward deaths of many westerns of the time had only served to desensitize the audience to the brutality of the weapon. I,like little Joey, played gunfights in the backyard with toy guns with (caps were generally unavailable) vocally-produced sound effects of pow-pow or kish. We dramatically clutched our chests and fell forwards, counted to ten and then jumped up and returned to the fun. We had been brought up on the fantasy and unreality of T.V. and film westerns. Shane was the first film to make me do a rethink about the romanticism of guns. Torrey's death seemed real as did the whole film. The clothes were clothes (homemade or store-bought), not costumes from a Hollywood costume company, and the faces were those of people who may have really lived in the north west of the U.S.A. in the 1880\/90's. Jean Arthur is the prettiest woman in the film but even she had a thick-set body of a pioneer woman. She was in her 50's at the time and I am sure that Stevens didn't want a glamorous actress (by modern day standards) to give a hint of unreality to the film. As Shane leaves, he tells Little Joey to go home and tell his mother that there are no more guns in the valley. I am sure he meant six-guns that are designed to kill people. For those who want to argue about the necessity of guns for pioneers, there was still a rifle at the Starrett homestead but it wasn't kept loaded. It was there to provide meat or as protection but it was not the same as the guns Shane or Wilson carried. I hope Joey grew up strong and straight as Shane wished and that he grew up to know the difference between fantasy and reality. I thank George Stevens for helping me to realize the difference between the two. Oh, by the way, I am not naive enough to think that anything I have written could change minds. If watching Shane doesn't make you do a rethink then nothing will change you.

The ugly New York locations are great, too. All in all, it's worth 98 minutes of your viewing time! ","genre":"Mystery, Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"25 May 2014","score":"","review":" This film heralds the arrival of a new action star, is you discount blood sport. I went into the film not knowing about it, except for what I analysed from the movie ad, the day before. What was strange, was apart from me, there was only one other guy in this cinema, and I was in a big cinema too, one cinema really reserved for big hits. This wasn't one of em' where Kickboxer shortly followed in it's footsteps. The movie is futuristic fun, but I found some parts of it boring. It's backdrops and fight sequences make for absorbing viewing, only we haven't got the best actor, who like Seagal, only has little gestures or expressions, but Van Damme's presence does make the film. There's a plague going around, and a lone warrior bumps into a woman (Dayle Haddon) who's telling him of this merciless killer (a sort of Brian Cobra Thompson speaking guy, who likes as he says The misery) who's out to find the creation of the plague to destroy all mankind, and who better than Van Damme to stop him. But Van Damme is also on a personal mission to track down this killer. Granted, with the positives of what I've said, Cyborg still really isn't a futuristic hit, just a kill timer really. Watch how Van Damme frees himself when tied to a wooden cross like Jesus, (I can just feel those legs again).
