There is no doubt that the young as well as the young at heart will be convulsing with joy at the adventure sequences as well as the 'out of this world' nature of the production.

The trend in recent years for films which entertain all age groups including the grown ups with cross over humor and adventure such as Toy Story, Shrek and the upcoming Monsters Inc may well cause some people to expect more from the Rowling cash cow.

But although this movie had some good points, I could think of more bad points than good ones. It obviously meant well, and it sure seemed felt like it SHOULD be a good movie, I left the theater with a bad taste in my mouth that has not gone away.The acting was not as impressive as it should have been. Gene Hackman was, of course, very good, but his performance was the only notable one. Danny DeVito was OK, but his role was nothing spectacular. I found this to be funny, because in the trailer, he looked like the best part of the movie. This as because his best parts were including in the trailer, and this is also true of the dialogue in this movie. Aside from the final words between Hackman and DeVito at the end of this movie, (which I think is the funniest and most cleverest in the entire film) all the truly good lines had been used in the commercials. A lot of the remaining dialogue was for the most part, not nearly as clever. More than one line just seemed flat out stupid to me. (For example, after punching and incapacitating someone, Delroy Lindo's character said Why did the chicken cross the road? Because the road crossed the chicken? What the hell does that mean?)Another thing that I found annoying was the unbelievable amount of double-crosses and twists in this movie, especially at the end. After the first twist (which is early in the movie), the rest are pretty easy to see coming. So the ending becomes predictable. (SPOILER AHEAD! SPOILER AHEAD!) The only twist I didn't see coming was when Hackman's wife left him at the end for the loser DeVito cronie at the end, and the only reason I didn't see this coming was that it was so ridiculously stupid, it doesn't seem conceivable.(SPOILER AHEAD! SPOILER AHEAD!) Another bad point that really stuck with me was that after one of the members of Hackman's gang was killed, nobody seemed to care. Even though they were all very close to each other throughout the rest of the film, and even though that the particular person killed was even willing to let himself get hit by a car (!) just to give other gang members a chance to get away from a very small threat, after he died, the others just seemed to shrug and forget about it.There were a few good points aside from Gene Hackman in this movie too, such as some good dialogue, an exciting ending gunfight scene and some cool robbery scenes. But it's still not enough for me to consider the movie recommendable. If you're a big Hackman fan, you might want to check it out just for him.

Some of my favorite critics gave this movie enthusiastically good reviews.  And most of my friends who saw it said it was surprisingly good and much better than it looked in the trailers.  Well, I actually thought it looked cool in the trailers.  And I was disappointed by the end result. I think dumb blonde stereotypes on film have grown tired and annoying.  Luckily, in only a few scenes are we subjected to those annoying stereotypes in lame gags.  Yes, stupid can be funny, but there has to be a certain amount of wit behind the stupidity.  For example, I cracked up at Elaine May's portrayal of an airhead in Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks.  Though Reese plays a dumb blonde herself, intelligent only in health and beauty products, she has enough charm to pull it off.  One of my favorite comedies is My Cousin Vinny, and it's hilarious to watch Vincent Gambini (Joe Pesci) as a fish-out-of-water, new to the whole legal system and using his Brooklyn-born street smarts to win the case.  Sure, Vincent Gambini wouldn't really be able to pull off that whole act, but films are not meant to be reality; they're meant to be a depiction of reality.  And the depiction was quite well.  And some of his evidence was quite sufficient, helping us suspend disbelief.  In Elle Woods' (Reese) case, we're supposed to go along with her shallow philosophies and cheer her on  Exercise builds endorphins.  Endorphins make people happy.  Happy people don't murder their husbands.  OK, she's right.  But a chimp could've thought of that.  Her shallow philosophies certainly won't hold water in an actual courtroom.  I'm sure people in the law profession will watch this movie and roll their eyes from start to finish.  Face it, Elle Woods makes Vincent Gambini look like Johnny Cochrane.  The plot is predictable from start to finish, filled with painfully familiar subplots.  Elle gets dumped by Warner.  This Warner guy was obviously a complete jerk from the start, and she's going to do whatever it takes to enroll in Harvard Law to get this idiot back?  And of course, we have that tired subplot involving snooty popular kids and naive geeks.  The snooty kids don't become so snooty after a while and reveal their nicer sides.  The geek boys and geek girls rise to popularity.  Anything we HAVEN'T seen before?  I laughed a few times.  I enjoyed the scene where the pool boy is revealed as gay, and tries to prove otherwise.  Then his boyfriend Chuck rises from the jury and walks out the courtroom yelling You b**ch!  The beautiful Ali Larter is in the cast.  Boy, I love that girl!  And I love that song Perfect Day by Hoku.  Legally Blonde is a harmless comedy that simply tries to undermine the intelligence of its audience, making it not much different from all these other lame teen comedies in past years.

This Warner guy was obviously a complete jerk from the start, and she's going to do whatever it takes to enroll in Harvard Law to get this idiot back?  And of course, we have that tired subplot involving snooty popular kids and naive geeks.  The snooty kids don't become so snooty after a while and reveal their nicer sides.  The geek boys and geek girls rise to popularity.  Anything we HAVEN'T seen before?  I laughed a few times.  I enjoyed the scene where the pool boy is revealed as gay, and tries to prove otherwise.  Then his boyfriend Chuck rises from the jury and walks out the courtroom yelling You b**ch!  The beautiful Ali Larter is in the cast.  Boy, I love that girl!  And I love that song Perfect Day by Hoku.  Legally Blonde is a harmless comedy that simply tries to undermine the intelligence of its audience, making it not much different from all these other lame teen comedies in past years.  And it hardly reaches its comic potential.  I wouldn't completely overrule this comedy, but audiences deserve better.

Alejandro Amenábar is truly one of the best writers. He deserves an academy award for this film. I have seen Open your eyes and also Thesis. Thesis was pretty good, but I can't say the same for Open your eyes. I really didn't like it that much since the story wasn't as brilliant as the others. The others is an excellent movie. You must see it if you like horror, mystery and thriller movies. I was reading some comments on it and saw that many people compared it with Sixth sense. The others is much better than sixth sense. In fact I didn't like Sixth sense at all. It was so simple and wasn't scary at all. I just laughed at it. I didn't understand why it won some academy awards. I don't think it deserved them. Anyway it's not important to keep making critical remarks about it. I hope The others will win academy awards, because it really deserved them. It is amazing to see Nicole Kidman as a mother who loves her children with her whole being. She truly knows how to act. What a tremendous actress!!. I was delighted to see her a while ago in The portrait of a lady. She is one of the best actresses in Hollywood. I never forget her wonderful movies. The portrait of a lady by Jane Campion is my favorite movie, She did an excellent work as Isabel Archer. It's definitely her best performance. She is always beautiful and talented. She must be an academy award winner for best actress in a leading role either in Moulin Rouge or in the others.  Grace's children also acted very well. it's unbelievable that two kids could do this. The others is about a family (Grace and her children) who lives in a very big house after the war. Grace's husband went to the war, but he hasn't gone back to their house yet.  Her children are photo sensible, it means that they can't see the light day. They can't even go to the garden. It might kill them. It makes this movie a dark one. Some people go to work to that house (Mrs. Willis, the gardener and a girl who is mute). You'll know why she got mute at the ending. I bet it'll frighten you. Many odd things happen in this house. It seems that there are others who are living with them. The little girl tells her mother she has seen other in the house; However she doesn't believe her until she gets to see them. When you see this movie, you'll think you're living in that stylish, dark and big house. Anything can happen in this movie. Things are not always as they seem. Appearances can be deceiving. Watch and enjoy it. It's really worth watching.

It even caused me to jump, without the slightest sting (i.e., a quick, piercing musical cue), when I should have entirely expected what was coming. I wasn't thinking ahead at all in the film, but was just feeling it. That is enormous praise. I have to commend specifically the cinematography and the music. The shot composition is absolutely beautiful. It succeeds in not being particularly showy. And it's not that I mind showiness. I can find that fun, too. But it is amazing that a film like this could be so carefully photographed that I had to fight my mind to notice the excellence of it. That is, the cinematography worked 100% to enhance the mood. The score is made up mostly of organ music (the main character plays the organ at a local church. so there's good use of both diagetic and extra-diagetic music; in general, the use of sound in the film is excellent), and, well, the pipe organ is an enormously creepy instrument in the first place - church scares the hell out of me! - but this music is particularly chilling. The editing is also very good. I especially like the use of speeding up the film near its end. I guess the only weak spot would be the story. You can see the ending coming from a long ways away.

The children sat and watched it without any moments where there attention strayed. It flies by.I've never seen a film twice at the cinema but I intend to see this one again because there's so much to it.The special effects are great and the film reminds me of a cross between Raiders of the Lost Ark and say an Enid Blyton Famous Five Film. However, its very English so it will be intersting to see what the Americans think. Its pure escapism with another World..Hogwarts School being created. In that sense there's no clash with the horrors of Sept 2001.The costume design\/ sets are brilliant ..eg Gringotts Wizard Bank and Diagon Alley Wizard shops (and the Gringotts goblins). The Move from London 2001 into Wizard London is magical as is the Kings Cross scenes.All the actors are well cast, Richard Harris (who I've never been keen on plays a brilliant Albus Dumbledore)The 3 main child actors are very good; they don't come over like some slightly obnoxious Annakin SkyWalker in Star Wars.Harry Potter is fairly straight good guy ; so its a difficult part to play as like Superman he doesn't have much character. Ron Weasly is the character and he really looks the part with a distinctive rubbery face. Hermione Granger is bossy, very pretty and plays a strong part.What you start to realise is how much has to be left out of a film which sticks very close,timewise,plotwise to the book. To portray the book in full would take a ten hour film so lots have to go eg Draco Malfoys first meeting with Harry on the train and rat scabbers attack and Hermiones logic challenge after Ron's Chess game beating up.The stars (John Hurt , Cleese, Julie Walters etc etc ) all play great parts though one soon realises how cut down the characters have to be to get the main storyline in.There are memorable scenes (and quite scary ones at that). (so not suitable I'd say for any under fives). The film will however appeal to adults as well as kids. 1) The Quidditch Match 2) The Wizard Chess Game 3) The Troll on the loose in Hogwarts 4) The encounter with Voldemort at the end. 5) Gringotts security systems.I'm just giving a general flavour of a film which in my opinion is far superior to the last Star Wars and which is even better than Toy Story\/Bugs Life.My opinion is that this Harry Potter film will not just be a hyped wonder but will last a long long time in terms of popularity and staying power; it will thus do well on Video\/DVD when the time comes but prior to that will enjoy a long run at the box office.Cheers   ","genre":null},{"date":"11 November 2001","score":"","review":"  I saw Harry Potter film Saturday morning at 10.35 in Odeon Harrogate.Ive read the books and went with 2 seven year olds (boy and girl) and my wife.

Of the four of us only my wife hadn't read the book.We all enjoyed the film very much including my wife who had doubts initially about sitting through a film nearly 2 1\/2 hours long. The children sat and watched it without any moments where there attention strayed. It flies by.I've never seen a film twice at the cinema but I intend to see this one again because there's so much to it.The special effects are great and the film reminds me of a cross between Raiders of the Lost Ark and say an Enid Blyton Famous Five Film.

So, I enjoyed the hell out of this film. While it's not The Others or The Sixth Sense, it's still better than the remakes of 1999, The Haunting and House On Haunted Hill.The opening scene in the junkyard was gruesome, loud and chock-full of bloody visuals. I also liked the way they presented the opening credits. It introduces the audience to Arthur Kriticos and his family in a slow circular transition between what it once was and what it is now. Sure, the plot is unbelievable and you wonder what makes someone just get up and take their family to a house that they've just inherited from someone they barely know? Not to mention they're supposed to be poor and have numerous unpaid bills, yet they have a nanny? But, it's a horror film and they're not exactly known for their Oscar-worthy screenplays (The Others and The Sixth Sense fit into the horror genre but, to me, were more Drama then Horror). The acting isn't that bad and is a lot better then most Horror films, but the dialogue was kind of silly. But, you know what? Who cares?! This was a fun, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride. The suspense was great. I felt myself clinging to my seat a few times. The visuals were stunning and the ghosts themselves are beyond awesome. My favorite ghost was The Jackal, freaky as hell with his straight jacket, caged head and gorilla-esque run, he had the pleasure of being in the most tense scenes in the film, getting himself a piece of Shannon Elizabeth and Tony Shalhoub.

In fact, let me help you  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  There.  Now take a moment to think, really think about it.  And if it still doesn't mean anything, take a couple of hours and check out `Legally Blonde,' a comedy with some real teeth in it, directed by Robert Luketic and starring Reese Witherspoon.  The premise of the story has to do with upscale sorority girl Elle Woods (Witherspoon), who instead of getting the long awaited, much anticipated marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), finds herself jilted as he prepares to leave for Harvard Law School.  Elle, it seems, just doesn't fit the oh-so-serious, somber profile that the wife of a future Senator must have.  It's all about image, and Elle's own 4.0 grade average earned in her `frivolous' curriculum apparently doesn't carry any weight.  Being outgoing, positive, beautiful AND intelligent just won't do among the `serious' of the `upper crust' elite.  So, because she looks good and enjoys her life, Elle is given the gate, and she just can't understand why.  She's devastated.  But she's also smart.  Smart enough to pick herself up and make a decision that stands them all on their ears.  With the grades and the wherewithal to swing it, she enters Harvard Law herself, initially with the intent of winning back Warner.  But along the way she  learns something important-- about the way things really are, about people and about herself, as well.  And she sets out to prove that if there is any `shallowness' around, it's only in the minds of those who perceive her as something and someone other than what she really is.  And, for the viewer, right out of the gate this is someone you want to see succeed in her quest, because her triumph-- whatever it may be or however it comes out-- is going to be one you share right along with her.\tMake no mistake, this is one funny movie-- in fact, it's downright hilarious at times.  But beyond the laughter it evokes, there's a flip side to the same coin.  Because beyond all of the comedy there is some serious issues at the heart of this film, and anyone who's ever been subjected to trials and tribulations simply because they didn't happen to fit a certain `mold,' or coincide with someone else's `opinions' of the way things should be, will be able to identify with Elle's situation.  And it's something you have to be aware of, because even while you're laughing at the funny stuff, at the same time it's almost painful to watch Elle endure the senseless, heartless, unnecessary and unwarranted acts that are perpetrated upon her.  At the core of the matter is not only the need for tolerance and understanding, but the necessity and importance of keeping an open mind about everything that transpires around you.  Who knows what monumental contributions an individual is capable of making in this imperfect machinery we call society if they are prejudged into oblivion?  So there's a lot more to this film than meets the eye; `dumb blonde' jokes get nipped in the bud, and by using a comedy format, the filmmakers here have produced a film that is not only entertaining, but thoroughly thought-provoking, as well.\tReese Witherspoon opens herself up and gives a dynamic performance here as Elle; she conveys such a full-of-life spirit that it is easy to empathize with her, and when the hurt comes, you feel it with her.  And through it all, the way she takes it on the chin then moves on with her life makes her a role model for those who may find themselves in a similar situation.  On one hand, when Elle finds solace by getting a manicure at the local beauty shop, it makes for a falling-on-the-floor moment of hilarity, and yet you're always aware of that other side of the coin, as well.  And it makes you root for her all the more.  Witherspoon has a perky, vibrant screen presence that makes her perfect for this part, and she makes Elle a flawed and therefore very real person.  When she gets knocked down, you feel for her; and then there's that feeling of triumph when she gets back up and stands her ground.  There's no question that this is Witherspoon's movie, and it's one of the best performances of her career.\tThe supporting cast includes Luke Wilson (Emmett), Selma Blair (Vivian), Victor Garber (Professor Callahan), Jennifer Coolidge (Paulette), Holland Taylor (Professor Stromwell), Ali Larter (Brooke Taylor-Windham), Jessica Cauffiel (Margot), Linda Cardellini (Chutney), Alanna Ubach (Serena) and Oz Perkins (Dorky David), with a special appearance by Raquel Welch as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark.  An entertaining, accessible film that should be embraced by a wide audience because of the clever way in which it gets across it's message, `Legally Blonde' can be enjoyed by just taking it at face value and soaking up the jokes, but offers even greater rewards to those who really delve into it and see it as an examination of human nature.  Not always, but occasionally, a movie is so much more than what it appears to be on the surface, and this is one of them.  What makes it so good is the fact that it can really make you laugh, while at the same time it's subtly telling you that there is no place for cruelty within the realm of human relationships.  It's a film that's worth seeing many times over, and that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9\/10.

In fact, let me help you  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  There.  Now take a moment to think, really think about it.  And if it still doesn't mean anything, take a couple of hours and check out `Legally Blonde,' a comedy with some real teeth in it, directed by Robert Luketic and starring Reese Witherspoon.  The premise of the story has to do with upscale sorority girl Elle Woods (Witherspoon), who instead of getting the long awaited, much anticipated marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), finds herself jilted as he prepares to leave for Harvard Law School.  Elle, it seems, just doesn't fit the oh-so-serious, somber profile that the wife of a future Senator must have.  It's all about image, and Elle's own 4.0 grade average earned in her `frivolous' curriculum apparently doesn't carry any weight.  Being outgoing, positive, beautiful AND intelligent just won't do among the `serious' of the `upper crust' elite.  So, because she looks good and enjoys her life, Elle is given the gate, and she just can't understand why.  She's devastated.  But she's also smart.
