What I can say is that I can't imagine how on earth United Artists could ever have imagined they had a viable commercial project on their hands in this unlovely, feel-bad, incomprehensible Western -- what mass-market audience did they ever imagine would flock to see a five-hour epic more akin to Andrei Rublev than to Stagecoach? Andrei Rublev, for Western audiences, at least had the benefit of subtitles. For many sequences Heaven's Gate is badly in need of them -- and I understand Russian and German, so I had a flying advantage over the intended audience! But it is the English dialogue that is in many places so 'naturalistic' as to be entirely incomprehensible. Add that to a script that simply doesn't explain important facts for much of the film, and a vast cast of barely-differentiated stereotypes, and you end up with viewers struggling simply to understand what was going on; I had to log on to the IMDb and read through a number of threads on the film's discussion board before I even grasped who the characters in the first and last scenes were meant to *be*, let alone what was the point of the scenes in question. (The latter question, I confess, still escapes me.) It wasn't until Averill got sacked that I even realised what his job was!My best guess as to what this film was actually trying to achieve is that it was a last-ditch attempt to fight back against television by doing all the things contemporary American TV couldn't provide widescreen presentation (which is well used here, without the all too common problems when composing close-up shots for a letter-box-shaped screen), gratuitous nudity and swearing (it gets thrown in every so often as if the director is trying to prove he can), and graphic shots of mangled corpses, intestines, splattered brains etc. And, of course, long stretches of running time with which to conjure magic in the absence of commercial breaks.But there is no way that it can justify its uncut length. It's plain from the first moment just where all those hours went -- not into complex plot or characterisation, but the very simple device of holding each and every shot that little bit longer than necessary. Every establishing shot of background activity could have been trimmed by at least half; all the endless pauses during the dialogue could have gone, to the improvement both of the general pacing and of the running-time. But even cutting the film back to the bone -- the reputed 90-minute version might have been interesting -- cannot cover for its other problems the mumbled and obscured dialogue, the deliberate and bewildering choice to film long stretches through dust or smoke, and above all the lack of basic exposition that left me struggling through the entire movie with questions such as 'who was that? why did that just happen? what did that mean?' The film is ugly -- deliberately so, I'm pretty sure -- and downbeat, again deliberately so. The only thing I can say in its favour is that despite the extreme running length, which kept me in the cinema from half-past six to eleven o'clock at night, and cost me eight pounds sterling into the bargain for this privilege, it kept me concentrating so hard on trying to understand what was going on that I was never even close to falling asleep; although all that effort did catch up with me during the intermission in the shape of a massive bout of yawning! It's not, I think, the worst film I've ever seen. It does have moments of interest and occasional beauty; it suffers principally by its gross and over-indulgent scale. But a film this size would have to be really, really good to justify the effort, and Heaven's Gate isn't even good enough to count as mediocre. By the end I was dying for a wise-cracking little comedy, a nice taut thriller or a lively silent melodrama -- anything to take the turgid taste of this bloated, putrid 1970s-era whale out of my mouth.Even a bad film would do. I'd rather watch Satan met a Lady -- infinitely rather -- than bother with Heaven's Gate again. I'd sooner see Lawnmower Man; at least it would be over more quickly. I'd prefer (heaven help me) to sit through What! No Beer?...One doesn't have to be prejudiced against a film to dislike it. The programme advertising the showing was full of praise for its brave, clear-sighted view of class struggle, its epic sweep unjustly cut from its original grandeur by the distributors. I saw it for the first time under the most favourable of conditions, on a giant screen with a sympathetic audience, many of whom had seen it before or were curious as to the uncut version (and who could be found during the intermission explaining the plot so far to their bemused companions); and after having seen the original product in all its unmolested glory, I'd say that the critics got it right first time round.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western"},{"date":"24 May 2006","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Contrary to what one reviewer assumes, Hollywood does not generally attack witchcraft or treat it as being necessarily evil. To do so would be to do the subject an honour it does not deserve, the honour of being treated as a genuine phenomenon. There are, to be sure, a small minority of Wiccans- well represented on this board- who genuinely believe that they can cast spells and an equally small minority of fundamentalist Christians who genuinely believe that there exist witches who possess malign powers given to them by Satan. For the great majority of people, however, at least in the West, belief in witchcraft is equated with ignorant and irrational superstition, and Hollywood has long since learnt that it is not good box-office to make serious films about things your audience refuses to take seriously.What Hollywood does is to use witchcraft in two ways. One is for purely humorous purposes, as in the television comedy Bewitched. The other is to use it as a metaphor for the human condition. The witch or wizard is not a god or a devil, but a human being who happens to have extraordinary powers. He or she is also a moral being, aware of the difference between good and evil and with the responsibility to distinguish between them when making use of his or her powers. The Harry Potter films are a good example of this. Harry's magical powers may be pure fantasy (and the films never try to persuade us that they are anything else), but the moral choices which face him are the same as those which face people in the real world. The audience need to suspend their disbelief in witchcraft, but not their belief in right and wrong.The Craft has the ambition to be another film of this type. Like the Potter films it is set in a school, but this is an everyday Los Angeles school rather than a British public school specialising in the magical arts. The film centres on a clique of three girls, Nancy, Bonnie and Rochelle who are regarded as strange and eccentric by their classmates because of their obsession with witchcraft. All three are outsiders. Nancy, the leader of the clique, is from a poor, trailer-trash family, looked down upon by her more middle-class schoolfellows. Bonnie is convinced she is physically unattractive because of scars on her body. Rochelle is the only black girl in the class, and the victim of racist taunts from the class bitch Laura. (Laura- like Cordelia in Buffy the Vampire Slayer- is an example of that over-used stock figure in American high school dramas, the most popular girl who manages to retain her popularity despite being obviously unpleasant; I suspect that in real life a girl who went around making comments like I don't like negroids would be shunned by her classmates, not voted Miss Popularity).A fourth girl, Sarah, is welcomed into the little clique. Sarah is herself an outsider, being a new girl at the school after her father has moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The girls discover that they do indeed have magical powers, and begin to use these powers to their advantage. Bonnie's scars disappear from her body; the handsome boy whom Sarah has set her heart on begins to fall in love with her. Gradually, however, the tone of the film darkens as the coven start to use their powers in a vindictive way; for example, Rochelle makes Laura's hair fall out. Sarah becomes worried by these developments and tries to use her powers to prevent Nancy, who is becoming seriously unbalanced, from harming others, but without success. The film darkens still further as Nancy uses witchcraft to kill those who have offended her, including her abusive stepfather. Sarah, frightened, tries to break free from the coven, only to find the others pursuing her.The film never succeeds in the way the Potter films do. This is partly because of the acting; apart from Fairuza Balk's Nancy, a memorably scary creation with her Goth make-up and spiky hair, all of the witches, especially Robin Tunney's Sarah, seem rather colourless. The main reason, however, why the film does not succeed is that it lacks the imagination that distinguishes all great fantasy films. J.K. Rowling's books (like those of Tolkien) are so successful because they conjure up a whole new world of the imagination, a world which is both like our world and different, a world populated both by strange creatures and by seemingly ordinary mortals like Harry himself, and the films are able to translate this world into cinematic terms. The Craft, by contrast, lacks this visual imagination. It is never able to transport us into another world, but remains firmly stuck in the real world of a banal American high school, which just happens to be a high school where four girls have magical powers. Unlike the Potter films and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which use the language of fantasy to make serious points about good and evil and human nature, The Craft remains an essentially trivial film, where supernatural special effects are simply used to liven up what is no more than a story about bitchy schoolgirls being nasty to each other. 5\/10.

The film centres on a clique of three girls, Nancy, Bonnie and Rochelle who are regarded as strange and eccentric by their classmates because of their obsession with witchcraft. All three are outsiders. Nancy, the leader of the clique, is from a poor, trailer-trash family, looked down upon by her more middle-class schoolfellows. Bonnie is convinced she is physically unattractive because of scars on her body. Rochelle is the only black girl in the class, and the victim of racist taunts from the class bitch Laura. (Laura- like Cordelia in Buffy the Vampire Slayer- is an example of that over-used stock figure in American high school dramas, the most popular girl who manages to retain her popularity despite being obviously unpleasant; I suspect that in real life a girl who went around making comments like I don't like negroids would be shunned by her classmates, not voted Miss Popularity).A fourth girl, Sarah, is welcomed into the little clique. Sarah is herself an outsider, being a new girl at the school after her father has moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The girls discover that they do indeed have magical powers, and begin to use these powers to their advantage. Bonnie's scars disappear from her body; the handsome boy whom Sarah has set her heart on begins to fall in love with her. Gradually, however, the tone of the film darkens as the coven start to use their powers in a vindictive way; for example, Rochelle makes Laura's hair fall out. Sarah becomes worried by these developments and tries to use her powers to prevent Nancy, who is becoming seriously unbalanced, from harming others, but without success. The film darkens still further as Nancy uses witchcraft to kill those who have offended her, including her abusive stepfather. Sarah, frightened, tries to break free from the coven, only to find the others pursuing her.The film never succeeds in the way the Potter films do. This is partly because of the acting; apart from Fairuza Balk's Nancy, a memorably scary creation with her Goth make-up and spiky hair, all of the witches, especially Robin Tunney's Sarah, seem rather colourless. The main reason, however, why the film does not succeed is that it lacks the imagination that distinguishes all great fantasy films. J.K. Rowling's books (like those of Tolkien) are so successful because they conjure up a whole new world of the imagination, a world which is both like our world and different, a world populated both by strange creatures and by seemingly ordinary mortals like Harry himself, and the films are able to translate this world into cinematic terms. The Craft, by contrast, lacks this visual imagination. It is never able to transport us into another world, but remains firmly stuck in the real world of a banal American high school, which just happens to be a high school where four girls have magical powers. Unlike the Potter films and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which use the language of fantasy to make serious points about good and evil and human nature, The Craft remains an essentially trivial film, where supernatural special effects are simply used to liven up what is no more than a story about bitchy schoolgirls being nasty to each other. 5\/10.

Rather than just adding another layer to the visuals, sound is often completely divorced from the visuals, creating two distinct elements working in concert. Another thing that marks M is its' subject matter, which was many years ahead of it's time and influenced countless other films while making Fritz Lang an enemy of the Nazi party.From the very beginning of the film, characters are heard before they are ever seen. We hear children playing and singing a violent nursery rhyme as they camera tilts down to reveal them on an eerie downward angle. Hearing the voices off screen, and without music makes for a haunting, almost ghostly screen presence that Lang will use again and again throughout the film, particularly with the killer Beckert.Borrowing a technique from opera known as Leitmotif, Lang first introduces Beckert by having us hear his whistling Hall of the Mountain King off screen, then representing him as a shadow on a wanted poster. From this moment on we understand that when we hear this tune, the killer is prowling. In fact, this is how the blind balloon seller recognizes Beckert in the end.One particularly memorable scene occurs shortly after the first child is abducted, when the child's frantic mother calls out for her repeatedly, with increased panic as we are shown several dark, empty scenes culminating in a small, childlike balloon figure caught in power lines before coming free and silently floating away.Almost as important as the technique used in this film is it's content. While much of our entertainment today involves psychotics and dark, violent stories, it goes without saying that in the late 20's and early 30's, the subject matter of film was somewhat tamer. M received heavy criticism from the Nazi party not for this however, but for the scenes in which the narrative switches back and forth between the police and the criminal element as they both discuss ways in which to catch the dangerous serial killer. This, along with the fact that the criminals beat the police to Beckert, supposedly degrades law enforcement by showing it as incompetent, although this is debatable, as the police would have caught Beckert soon anyway.There are also undercurrents of socialism in the film, which undoubtedly made the Nazis a little nervous. The criminals talk of pooling their money and using it to support the families of members temporarily incarcerated. At one point a policeman even says, each individual is responsible for what happens to the poorest child on the streets. At another time someone is heard to lament the effects of fear on a desperate population,  there's no privacy anymore. For a government built on fear after the Reichstag fire, this might have been seen as sly criticism.Impressive films wisely use new technology in ways that push the boundaries of film. Classic films use bedrock principals of good storytelling to keep our interest and stay relevant even many years after their creations. While it's not often that a film can combine both of these elements to create a truly great film, Fritz Lang's M definitely qualifies. This is a groundbreaking film with a potent message that touches on debates about the nature of criminality and the ultimate responsibilities for actions.

But after seeing Julia Stiles in several films, and Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain, I became curious and rented the video. I did not expect to watch this movie three times, but that's precisely what I've done. This film is so much fun. It contains upbeat, intelligent humor (even for this over-fifty female), and it has a lot depth as well. I could particularly identify with Kat (Julia Stiles' character), not because of her bitchiness, which we see on the surface, but because the anger, pain and self-loathing reflected beneath her I don't give a rat's ass attitude was so poignantly and sympathetically portrayed. Stiles is a talented actress, bringing sensitivity and a quality of tension, frustration, hope and despair through the moods and angst of her teenage character. Heath Ledger is delightful as Patrick, the bad boy whose reputation is larger than his real life persona. In fact, it is Ledger's understated facial expressiveness that indicates his character's increasingly engaging personality.

With City Lights in 1931, the world said goodbye to him. In this context, it is easy to see how anyone even remotely a fan of the tramp would hold this film dear to their hearts and quietly champion it as one of the best films ever made.Now, to be clear, City Lights wasn't actually the tramp's last appearance in cinema. That came five years later, in Modern Times. However, by looking back to the time in which this film was made, and with the benefit of seeing it from our perspective in history, we can see why it was considered a bittersweet goodbye to the lovable tramp. With the advent of talkies in 1928, it would be a great understatement to say that film was forever changed. To this day some still debate whether that was a positive change or not. One thing is certain, that a great number of careers were ruined by the advent of sound. One of the biggest stars of the silent era was Charlie Chaplin's Tramp. As the years went by and talkie productions began outnumbering silent films ten to one, the world waited with bated breath to see how Chaplin would adjust to this major change. Finally, he answered with City lights. What everyone was expecting was for Chaplin to present the tramp in his first talkie, and in fact Chaplin was under immense studio pressure to do so. He stuck to his guns though, and presented them with what he must have felt was a goodbye letter to the silent era.All things considered, silent films could not have asked for a more elegant farewell. City Lights is an excellent example of everything that makes silent films superior to talkies, according to some. There's the trademark slapstick comedy, which still leaves audiences in stitches. This brand of comedy simply wouldn't work in a film with sound. Replaced two years later with the first Three Stooges short and their brand of somewhat cruder slapstick, Chaplin's humour necessitated silence. The acting in city lights was superb. The kind of subtlety that is called for in silent films is used to perfection here, displaying plot and emotion unmistakably without ever seeming to be overacting. This is due, no doubt, in part to the legendary perfectionism displayed by Chaplin during the filming of City Lights. Shooting 342 takes of one scene illustrates a level of passion for the film, which is evident in every frame.This is a film without a villain, really. The two main characters are extremely likable. The closest it has to an antagonist is the millionaire, however this is only half the time, and without him the Tramp would not be able to pursue his courtship of the flower girl. The tramp acts as a sort of guardian angel to his millionaire friend, saving him from suicide on several occasions. In almost every other scene, he is struggling to provide for the flower girl who holds his heart. She is the classic picture of noble poverty, never complaining, selling flowers everyday to provide for her grandmother and herself. The two of them are outsiders, struggling to find acceptance and love while being trapped by poverty, and in the flower girl's case, physical disability. In one memorable scene, when we first see her home, she seems jealous of a couple next door and the shot lingers on an image of a bird in cage. Later on the Tramp is literally caged when sent to prison for theft. In the ending, which is touted by some as the most perfect conclusion in film history both are freed from their respective cages when the Tramp is released and the flower girl is cured of her blindness. Now that they are free they can finally find acceptance within another.While not a true silent film, as it has a music track and sound effects, City Lights is in many ways the quintessential silent film. It was also one of Chaplin's last. After this he went into semi-retirement and made only a handful of films before passing away. Given this, and the fact that every scene drips with semi-sweet sentimentality, it is little wonder that fans of the era treasure it much the same way that fans of TV shows get misty-eyed thinking about the series finale of their favourite show. This is not to belittle it, as even non-fans can appreciate its message and storytelling. As James Hamilton said, If you don't like this movie, there is just something wrong with you.

City Lights is an excellent example of everything that makes silent films superior to talkies, according to some. There's the trademark slapstick comedy, which still leaves audiences in stitches. This brand of comedy simply wouldn't work in a film with sound. Replaced two years later with the first Three Stooges short and their brand of somewhat cruder slapstick, Chaplin's humour necessitated silence. The acting in city lights was superb. The kind of subtlety that is called for in silent films is used to perfection here, displaying plot and emotion unmistakably without ever seeming to be overacting. This is due, no doubt, in part to the legendary perfectionism displayed by Chaplin during the filming of City Lights. Shooting 342 takes of one scene illustrates a level of passion for the film, which is evident in every frame.This is a film without a villain, really. The two main characters are extremely likable. The closest it has to an antagonist is the millionaire, however this is only half the time, and without him the Tramp would not be able to pursue his courtship of the flower girl. The tramp acts as a sort of guardian angel to his millionaire friend, saving him from suicide on several occasions. In almost every other scene, he is struggling to provide for the flower girl who holds his heart. She is the classic picture of noble poverty, never complaining, selling flowers everyday to provide for her grandmother and herself. The two of them are outsiders, struggling to find acceptance and love while being trapped by poverty, and in the flower girl's case, physical disability. In one memorable scene, when we first see her home, she seems jealous of a couple next door and the shot lingers on an image of a bird in cage. Later on the Tramp is literally caged when sent to prison for theft. In the ending, which is touted by some as the most perfect conclusion in film history both are freed from their respective cages when the Tramp is released and the flower girl is cured of her blindness. Now that they are free they can finally find acceptance within another.While not a true silent film, as it has a music track and sound effects, City Lights is in many ways the quintessential silent film. It was also one of Chaplin's last. After this he went into semi-retirement and made only a handful of films before passing away. Given this, and the fact that every scene drips with semi-sweet sentimentality, it is little wonder that fans of the era treasure it much the same way that fans of TV shows get misty-eyed thinking about the series finale of their favourite show.

With City Lights in 1931, the world said goodbye to him. In this context, it is easy to see how anyone even remotely a fan of the tramp would hold this film dear to their hearts and quietly champion it as one of the best films ever made.Now, to be clear, City Lights wasn't actually the tramp's last appearance in cinema. That came five years later, in Modern Times. However, by looking back to the time in which this film was made, and with the benefit of seeing it from our perspective in history, we can see why it was considered a bittersweet goodbye to the lovable tramp. With the advent of talkies in 1928, it would be a great understatement to say that film was forever changed. To this day some still debate whether that was a positive change or not. One thing is certain, that a great number of careers were ruined by the advent of sound. One of the biggest stars of the silent era was Charlie Chaplin's Tramp. As the years went by and talkie productions began outnumbering silent films ten to one, the world waited with bated breath to see how Chaplin would adjust to this major change. Finally, he answered with City lights. What everyone was expecting was for Chaplin to present the tramp in his first talkie, and in fact Chaplin was under immense studio pressure to do so.

And the movie seemed to start off well. But it devolved into a disjointed, unfocused boring waste of time. I regret watching few films but this is one of them.There were some nicely done scenes -- the Japanese marching into town, the P-51s attacking the airfield (however I must note that a boy kept in a prison camp since the U.S. entry into the war would hardly have heard of a P-51, much less be able to recognize one; it wasn't developed until after the war started). But they were bright spots in a long boring movie.It's not that I don't like character-driven movies. Schindler's List shows what Spielberg can do with that type of film. It's stunning. But there was little in the movie to make you care about the characters. And the boy's admiration for the Japanese after years of captivity seems awfully strange. I can see how he might admire them as warriors before the war. I've had European friends who were children during the war say they admired the Germans military prowess even though they were enemies.

Because the term wasn't invented until Dracula, a huge box office hit, forced Universal Studios into making another horror film to follow it. 75 years on the impact Dracula had upon the audience is difficult to understand - we live, after all, in an age of blood, gore and sadistic horror. What would 1931 viewers have made of Hostel? Dracula remains the Grandaddy of all horror films; its opening reels are eerily magnificent, as we accompany innocent traveller Renfield (Dwight Frye) through the Transylvanian countryside, arriving at Castle Dracula in his bat-driven coach to deliver the deeds to Carfax, an old abbey in England, to the most infamous Hungarian nobleman of all time. We know what's in store for poor Dwight, as we have already glided softly through the castle to alight at Dracula's coffin as he emerges, brides in tow, to prepare for the arrival of his guest.In the opening twenty minutes the template for the horror film is laid out for all to see - the moody atmosphere, supernaturalism alive and well in our world, and the superstitious villagers' mounting dread as they discover Renfield's destination. It's a superb beginning, from the stately camera-work of Karl Freund to the man in black awaiting on the stairs of his castle for his visitor; and his chilling opening line I am...Dracula. I bid you welcome! Bela Lugosi has become for millions around the globe the definitive vampire. The role he was born to play he makes the most of it, all leering smiles,looming presence, penetrating stares and his old European cadence used to disturbing effect. Lugosi is more suggestive of evil than a thousand modern psycho-slashers.It's a great shame that the rest of the movie does not live up to this opening, which adapts the American stage play rather than Stoker's book. Once the action moves to Dr. Seward's asylum the film becomes static and talky, with shots held for far too long on several occasions. Tod Browning, the director, reportedly lost interest a few weeks into the production and turned over many chores to Freund. Yet Dracula's drawing room confrontation with Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) holds the interest, and you simply can't take your eyes of Bela.I confess a genuine affection for this film. Costing around $330,000 dollars to make, it scooped over a million back for its studio and was its biggest hit of 1931. Watch it late at night, with the lights out, let its strange pacing and macabre atmosphere take grip, and it will still hold you in thrall. Horror fans owe it so much.

I think that one of the main reasons of Love Story's success was its tragic characters and characters who surrounded by good circumstances. Those two contradictory factors made Love Story a surprise hit. Oliver(Ryan O'Neil), and Jennifer(Ali MacGraw), both of them, were Harvard Students. Although a Harvard diploma doesn't take a rose-colored view to their future, at least they can come up in the world.Finally, they did it.

The film gives us the account of a choreographer named Joe Gideon (Scheider) whose relentless way of living drives him straight into the grave. The character is based on the real life of director Bob Fosse who suffered the same fate in 1987. Gideon is a womanizing, drug abusing, perfectionist who begins each morning with the same routine. He pops a few pills, takes some Alka-Seltzer, jumps in the shower (sometimes with a cigarette in his mouth!), and declares it's showtime after giving himself one last look in the mirror. When we meet him, he's currently putting the finishing touches on a film he's just directed, and he's beginning work on a new Broadway musical. The man looks absolutely exhausted. He's always smoking. He seems on the brink of collapse from angina, and he frequently grasps his left arm apparently in an effort to determine if his heart is still beating or not.The main idea behind this film is that Gideon knows he's dying. The life he has lived has assured him only a brief stay on this earth. As the film plays out, we see how Gideon comes to grips with his impending fate. His final journey is often touching; sometimes joyful. But above all, it is compelling and once it's over, you'll probably wish Gideon had hung on longer. He seemed to have so much to live for. Even the people around him who he's hurt in life (his ex-wife and current girlfriend, for example) still are a big part of his life. He has a wonderful daughter who he's just getting to know, as well. Without him around, there would certainly be an enormous void left for all of the central characters in this film. We see him confess his life's sins to Jessica Lange who plays an angel waiting to usher him into the afterlife once he finally succumbs to his medical problems. The closer the two of them get, the closer he is to the grave.Fosse's direction is exceptional. His musical numbers (particularly Airotica) are top-drawer as you'd expect them to be. And he's never afraid to shock you with his camera-work. At one point we get an up-close and personal look at Gideon's heart surgery, and that's a bit grotesque for a musical. Remember this is the same director that showed us Dorothy Stratton's face getting blown off with a shotgun in Star 80.Fosse also understandably knows these characters better that they know themselves. By the end of the film, you really know Joe Gideon, and you feel like you've lived part of his life. Fosse saw the same fate coming to himself, and indeed it found him in 1987. We often wish exceptional individuals would stick around longer, but then again it's the way they live that makes them so exceptional.This film is highly recommended. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.

How ever I watch this film loads of times just like part 2 as they do have a strange power to make us watch them but after Jason obtains his mask it's too late the films have just become pure cheese so watching them makes it hard to believe they're such a historic film series.
