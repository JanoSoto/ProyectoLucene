That is somewhat surprising as there are so many stories there to be told. The Patriot tells the story of one man, Benjamin Martin, who fights for his family. If at the end of the fighting independence has been achieved that is all well and good. But for Benjamin Martin family comes first. He is reluctant to fight, unwilling to place his family in danger. He won't go to the war. But the war comes to him. Right to his front porch. With horrifying consequences. And so Benjamin Martin takes up the fight. And what a bloody fight it will be. Nobody ever said the birth of a new nation would be pretty. There will be tragedy, heartbreak and grief along the way. Nothing worth fighting for comes easily.It is a blow to his family which drags Benjamin into the war. A blow which will be avenged quickly and savagely. The tone is quickly set for a film which will be bathed in blood. But there is more to Benjamin than brutal violence. He proves to be smart, cunning, an inspiring leader. Mel Gibson gives an excellent performance in the role, capturing all that makes up this very unique man. There is a quiet dignity and honor to Benjamin Martin and Gibson brings that out. But there is that brutal side to him as well and Gibson handles that with aplomb too. Speaking of brutal, there is the film's main antagonist, the unspeakably evil British Colonel Tavington. When first we meet him he commits an obscene atrocity. And it only gets worse from there. This is truly one of the most reprehensible film characters ever. Jason Isaacs relishes the role, embraces the evilness. It's a solid performance from Isaacs but the character really does go too far. He's too evil. He does things which simply are not believable. Yes there were surely atrocities committed in this war but this film takes the character past the point of no return. Bad things may have been done but not that bad. No wonder so many British critics were up in arms upon the film's release. It's good if a film has a villain you can truly despise but this villain is just too much. He leaves such a bad taste in your mouth that it detracts from the film.The over-the-top villainous Tavington is not the film's only flaw. There is a lot of dialogue that is clunky and awkward. The film clearly goes on too long, approaching three hours and at times really struggling to sustain itself for that length of time. But despite the flaws the film does enough good things to be deemed a success. Gibson is excellent, Isaacs a worthy foil. Other winning performances come from Heath Ledger as Benjamin's son, so eager to join the fight, and Chris Cooper as an American Colonel trying to hold his ragtag army together. If you want a bit of romance there's that too, Joely Richardson and her absurdly bountiful cleavage paired up with Gibson and bright, young Lisa Brenner for Ledger. And then there is the war itself, the brutal battles. The film spares nothing in its gory accounts of 18th century combat. The close-range gunfire, the bloody bayonets, and the cannonballs that do truly grotesque things to a human body. There are two good stories here, the big picture revolution and the more personal story of the Martin family. Those stories are meshed together very well by director Roland Emmerich. We haven't gotten many American Revolution stories in films. This one, flawed and highly fictionalized though it may be, is ultimately a satisfying one.

Written and directed by Greg Berlanti who had previously written episodes of the popular American teen television show Dawson's Creek, could have been kitchen sink teen soap drama material. However, this slice of American gay life focusing on a close-knit social group of gay guys in the hot and vibrant West Hollywood, California has much more depth that you would have thought possible. Throughout the movie, we watch as this group of guys with very different personalities, tastes and ideal support and care for each one another. There is Howie who just cannot seem to let go of his ex-lover Marshall, even after Marshall starts to date another guy. There is the dashing narcissistically challenged Cole who would uses men like play things, carelessly throwing them away as soon as he's done, until he falls for someone, who literally throws him away. Patrick is another member of this band of friends; he has self-worth issues and must decide if he can pass on his sperm to his lesbian sister and her partner. Benji works hard on being accepted at any cost by the muscly dudes he admires so much, but the costs are high. Just at the start of his gay life, coming to terms with his sexuality and heading toward his first gay experience is the adorably cute Kevin, who touches a few hearts. The various stages of a break up are all consuming for the charmingly sweet Taylor and all this is set against the local gay softball team from Jack's Broken Heart's restaurant. Jack is the father figure of the group but ultimately the real lynch pin holding it all together is Dennis. Now Dennis is an aspiring photographer with a great eye for a shot and a caring personality that the others sometimes abuse yet love. Tragedy strikes this wonderful little group of pals and they come together for support, for love and for strength. One of the best things about this film is the way it shows all the various stages of gay life, the important things we all seem to go through, from the coming out, the exploration of our sexuality and our feelings. There is the self-conscious period, the shag anything period, the times when a relationship just will not work, yet being single does not seem to work. A wonderful poignant yet funny film about friends who love, support and annoy the hell out of each other. The script is wonderfully written, with powerful and funny lines side by side delivered by a wonderful ensemble cast, including Superman Dean Cain and Frasier's dad the lovely and talented John Mahoney. It had a low budget and was shot at a very rapid pace, which perhaps shows in one or two places, however the enjoyment factor overrides these slight flaws. It's not a rite of passage movie, or a film about AIDS, nor are there drag queens at every turn and you'll be hard pushed to find embittered angry parents, which may surprise you, this being a gay movie and all. Yes, it is a romantic comedy, yes it is a gay romantic comedy and yes, it is a bloody good film.

Instead of the McCallisters, we meet the Pruitt family and in particular the main character Alex. A computer chip worth ten million dollars is placed into a toy car by our four villains in an attempt to get through airport security. There is a mix up at the airport, and the toy car ends up in the possession of an older woman who gives it to little Alex as a gift. The four bad guys track the car to a neighbourhood in Chicago and break into a series of houses looking for the chip. Alex (who is HOME ALONE with chicken pox) see's the crooks breaking into the houses an calls the cops, only to look like a prank caller each time. The villains looking for the chip eventually realize that little Alex has it and that's when the fun begins - Home Alone style.I actually enjoyed Home Alone 3 as a kid and as an adult now. No, it isn't as good as the original films and no Alex Linz is not Macaulay Culkin. But this movie gets points for breaking off from the McCallister storyline. I mean how many times can that family forget the same kid? Young actor Alex Linz who plays Alex in Home Alone 3 does a great job taking on this big role, he manages to not put in an annoying performance like so many child actors can be do these kind of movies. The crooks include three men and one female, and I like that they added a woman into that villain role. They all are good actors and add plenty to this movie.The best comedic moments come from the crooks, especially David Thornton as 'Unger'. There are some ho-hum funny moments which fall flat such as the talking parrot and a few scenes with Alex's older brother and sister who torment him. Another flaw was the actual home alone bit, and the fact that Alex isn't really home alone as we've seen in the first two films. His mother leaves him for a couple of hours as he recuperates from Chicken Pox, hardly the same as Kevin McCallister went through. And I don't like that it doesn't take place ON Christmas. But those drawbacks don't take away from the whole movie at all. Home Alone 3 isn't great, but it takes some risks by moving from the original plot and adds some smarts it with the computer chip story. These aren't your simple criminals like the wet bandits were, they are after far more than some jewellery and expensive silverware.

The names Castor and Pollux also come from a pair of brothers in Greek mythology. The wonderful face off scene at the end between the two leads that had doves flying around is similar to Woo's classic 1989 Hong Kong film The Killer.The movie plot is about Sean Archer (John Travolta) an FBI Agent who has been chasing down a criminal crime Lord Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) for years. Their feud led to the death of Archer's son Michael and Archer strongly believes that his son's killer is his sworn enemy Castor Troy. Archer finally cornered Castor one day and a fight broke out and Troy got knocked out cold. But Archer later finds out that Troy has planted a bomb somewhere in Los Angeles and the only other person who knows the bomb location is Castor's brother Pollux, who refuses to talk. To get Pollux to talk a special operation doctor provided a solution that will require cutting off the face of Troy and placing it on Archer, Archer undergoes the surgery with the knowledge of limited people, so as to keep the operation hidden and takes the face of Troy to go undercover.

I was a college Freshman in 1963\/64, when the Beatles were first gaining popularity on this side of the pond, and this movie fairly accurately recreates that period, the way people dressed, and how teenagers reacted when seeing their pop idols live in concert.The story grabs hold of a theme I am very fond of pondering, both in real life and in fiction stories. That theme is the relative randomness of our lives, the things that happen, and then how we react to those random events. If we look at random events in our own lives, we can see how certain unexpected things shaped who we are today.In this movie a group of high school friends like to make music, one of them writes songs and is the featured singer. He has written That Thing You Do and they are about to perform it in a local small-potatoes contest. But the drummer, horsing around by showing the bass player how to jump over parking meters, falls and breaks his arm right before the contest.Now that is the random event, and it leads them to ask another guy in town, who is a good drummer, to sit in for that one gig, so that they will still have a chance to win the competition. Then comes the rest of the influence of that random event, the drummer own his own (this is important) decides to beat out a much faster tempo. It is this faster tempo that makes That Thing You Do a hit with the audience, attracts the attention of an agent, gets them a record, gets them a contract, puts them on tour, and has their hit rise towards the top of the charts.If their original drummer had not broken his arm, they would have just remained an ordinary band. Well as the story progresses they experience all the growing pains of sudden fame, and conflicting priorities among the members of the group. Tom Hanks directed, has a part as a record label agent, and he even wrote many of the songs. Tom Everett Scott who was in his mid-20s is very good as the replacement drummer, Guy Patterson. Liv Tyler, still a teenager was Faye Dolan who ended up traveling with the band. Her boyfriend was Johnathon Schaech as Jimmy who wrote the song and sang lead vocals. Steve Zahn was the crazy member Lenny, and Ethan Embry, also a teenager, was T. B. Player the unreliable bass player. Another teenager just starting her career was Charlize Theron as Tina in a fairly small part, as a flaky girlfriend who dumps Guy after an appointment with a handsome dentist.

Incredibly on this video cover, the violence reference is not mentioned. Crowe's performance here was the one that catapulted him to stardom, where as far as I'm concerned, this is still his best performance here. It's a pity they don't have Oscar awards in Oz, cause he'd win it hands down, as Hando, the unrelenting leader of a pack of skinheads, their hate for asians, reaching beyond what anyone could fathom. We don't learn much about their reasons for disliking the Vietnamese, and that's a good thing, cause if more was said as to why, the film would lose it's substance and ferocity. Every performance in this movie is excellent. Daniel Pollock, John Brumpton, and Jacqueline Mckenzie, a desperate junkie and a victim of incest, (pity that bloody Deep Blue Sea, put a stale period on her career) are all flawless. More here so, is Mckenzie, so believable when having a seizure, even I got concerned, even though I knew it was just acting. From the word get go, this movie takes on a no holds barred ride into a nightmare territory of boundless hate. The skinheads, even question the barman, at their favorite watering hole as to why he lets gooks in there. Later on at the same bar, the barman goes off with an Asian guy, who's gonna take over the business, leaving his two sons to mind the place. How could this barman be so reckless.

MARY POPPINS (1964) where Dick Van Dyke danced with animated Penguins. Not to mention BEDKNOBS and BROOMSTICKS (1971), where Angela Lansbury turns an animated lion into a rabbit.

His book, THE ANIMATOR'S SURVIAL KIT is a great book and he frequently references this movie he was involved in. Richard Williams nails the who's who of cartoons characters from various companies (such as Disney, Warner Brothers, Universal, MGM and Paramount not to mention lesser known ones), it's a shame that Popeye, Tom and Jerry, Little Lulu and Casper the Friendly Ghost didn't make it. Mr. Williams nailed not only Roger and Jessica Rabbit, but all the other characters given their proper 1947 look\/style. It is fascinating and is worth it for the aspiring animator\/animation student. Now going back, I say that this movie is funny and sugar-coated at first, and later it turns dark, dramatic and grim. No wonder this movie won an Oscar for Best Special Effects. To me, this was the KING KONG or STAR WARS of my childhood. All in all, it is a pretty good (family appropriate) movie. Kids will love it, adults will love it. There was planning for a sequel, but it didn't get made. Plus, this movie, akin to JAWS, KING KONG and STAR WARS, was imitated. In other words, studios made cash-in attempts, that looked nearly close to it. COOL WORLD (1992) starring Brad Pitt and Kim Basinger, with animation by Ralph Bakshi. EVIL TOONS (1992) starring David Carridine, is a Fred Olen Ray film that is the love child to EVIL DEAD and ROGER RABBIT. Sadly, the cartoon-animated beast gets a small amount of screen time and there is too much hot-girly action. I am glad that my parents didn't let me see THAT movie. Avoid it. Italy made VOLERE VOLARE (1991) by Guido Manuli and Maurizio Nichetti looks like what one critic said, ROGER RABBIT adult style. However, there were no other movies that exploited the combination between live-action and animation (cartoon animation not CGI).

Part of me wants to hate this movie because this film is not dark. They way batman is supposed to be is dark, that's who he is, that's the way Bob Kane created him back in 1939. That's the reason why I loved the two Tim Burton directed Batman films because they are so dark. But this is a film of it's time, made in 1995, you can never make a Batman movie like this one today. Especially after the extremely dark Christopher Nolan's Batmans. People now understand Batman should be dark but back in '95 people didn't fully understand that. The last film was controversial as some felt it was too dark, some parents said it scared kids and most problematic it was too dark to market towards kids, so Warners fired Tim and hired Joel Shumacher to make this film less dark and more family friendly. However despite all that, this is a really good movie. But it's also a strange movie because it's hard to say what this movie is, I mean is this supposed to be a sequel to Batman Returns or some kind of reboot. It has nothing to do with the previous two by Burton in both style or story. It basically disregards the continuity of the last two but Micheal Gough who played Alfred returns here along with Pat Hingle returning as Commissioner Gordan implying that this is a sequel. So I look at this as half sequel half reboot. The biggest thing about this movie is the visual look, I mean very colorful, the exact opposite of Tim Burton who made Gotham city look dark and gloomy. Joel let people know this is not going to be like that because Gotham looks bright and colorful. While Tim's Gotham looks like New York city, Joel's Gotham looks like Las Vegas, very flashy with a lot of bright lights. Even though Gotham city is supposed to be dark, I must admit it shows a lot of imagination and creativity to create his look of Gotham . This film is very cartoon-ish and campy, complete with cartoon sound effects. But what makes this movie good is that it does have a lot of seriousness to it and even a little dark. The plot is that Bruce Wayne is loosing the drive to continue being Batman & we look into his past as to why he became batman in the first place, he even quits being Batman for a time but the movie does a good job at exploring Bruce Wayne's psych in a way the previous films didn't. Val Kilmor(Keaton left 'cause he didn't want to do a non dark batman) is a good but not fantastic batman, he's a little stiff as Bruce Wayne but does a good job. The film has a lot of stuff going on in it, a love interest, the introduction of Robin, two villains & Batman himself but it does a good job balancing all characters in a coherent story. Nicole Kidman is the love interest, psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian, she's one of the best loves for Batman in a movie. She works really good in the story, she has a great romance with Bruce & her being a shrink is nicely done. Kidman gives a great performance & she looks really sexy in here too. Batman's famed sidekick Robin is introduced played by Chris O'Donnell. He does a decent job here, he provides some humor & O'Donnell does a good job being angry, rebellious but still likable. The writers do a good job at Bruce's & Dick's relationship & their share feeling of vengeance for the murders of their parents. But there's one bad thing about this movie, that's Tommy Lee Jones as the villain Two-Face, for non comic book geeks you probably find his two-face to be fine but as a comic book geek I must say two-face here is a huge disappointment! He's just way too campy and 1 dimensional. If you know the comic book, two-face has the potential to be a very psychologically damaged, terrifying, & sympathetic villain. But here he's just a campy villain who lacks all the qualities I just mentioned and Joel goes overboard with the theme of everything being in twos for two-face, it got too silly. But to make up for the lackluster take on two-face is famous comedian Jim Carrey in his truly fantastic performance as my favorite batman villain, The Riddler! Durning this time Jim was at the peek of his popularity and one could say that his performance here is just another routine comedy act for Jim but I think it's much more then that. Carrey brings so much color & life to the Riddler. It's truly fascinating to watch Jim go, he's really over the top here, so much so that he makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look understated. But Jim is both funny & menacing here not to mention crazy. There are many different ways you can portray the Riddler and Carrey gave a performance that's unique & all his own and he's helped by a good script that has a good story for Edward Nygma who will become the Riddler. They give Nygma his brilliance as he plans to absorb people's brainwaves making him the superior intellect. I also like the various riddler outfits he wears. Jim looks great in his skin tight green jump suit & with red hair. I love the way he twirls his cane and the scene where riddler gleefully destroys the bat-cave is awesome! He has a great laugh, and a lot great one liners. Carrey's performance is a stand out in the entire movie series. This movie has a lot great special effects, great action scenes and score, so despite not being really dark I find this to be a really good movie.

It has nothing to do with the previous two by Burton in both style or story. It basically disregards the continuity of the last two but Micheal Gough who played Alfred returns here along with Pat Hingle returning as Commissioner Gordan implying that this is a sequel. So I look at this as half sequel half reboot. The biggest thing about this movie is the visual look, I mean very colorful, the exact opposite of Tim Burton who made Gotham city look dark and gloomy. Joel let people know this is not going to be like that because Gotham looks bright and colorful. While Tim's Gotham looks like New York city, Joel's Gotham looks like Las Vegas, very flashy with a lot of bright lights. Even though Gotham city is supposed to be dark, I must admit it shows a lot of imagination and creativity to create his look of Gotham . This film is very cartoon-ish and campy, complete with cartoon sound effects. But what makes this movie good is that it does have a lot of seriousness to it and even a little dark. The plot is that Bruce Wayne is loosing the drive to continue being Batman & we look into his past as to why he became batman in the first place, he even quits being Batman for a time but the movie does a good job at exploring Bruce Wayne's psych in a way the previous films didn't. Val Kilmor(Keaton left 'cause he didn't want to do a non dark batman) is a good but not fantastic batman, he's a little stiff as Bruce Wayne but does a good job. The film has a lot of stuff going on in it, a love interest, the introduction of Robin, two villains & Batman himself but it does a good job balancing all characters in a coherent story. Nicole Kidman is the love interest, psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian, she's one of the best loves for Batman in a movie. She works really good in the story, she has a great romance with Bruce & her being a shrink is nicely done. Kidman gives a great performance & she looks really sexy in here too. Batman's famed sidekick Robin is introduced played by Chris O'Donnell. He does a decent job here, he provides some humor & O'Donnell does a good job being angry, rebellious but still likable. The writers do a good job at Bruce's & Dick's relationship & their share feeling of vengeance for the murders of their parents. But there's one bad thing about this movie, that's Tommy Lee Jones as the villain Two-Face, for non comic book geeks you probably find his two-face to be fine but as a comic book geek I must say two-face here is a huge disappointment! He's just way too campy and 1 dimensional. If you know the comic book, two-face has the potential to be a very psychologically damaged, terrifying, & sympathetic villain. But here he's just a campy villain who lacks all the qualities I just mentioned and Joel goes overboard with the theme of everything being in twos for two-face, it got too silly. But to make up for the lackluster take on two-face is famous comedian Jim Carrey in his truly fantastic performance as my favorite batman villain, The Riddler! Durning this time Jim was at the peek of his popularity and one could say that his performance here is just another routine comedy act for Jim but I think it's much more then that. Carrey brings so much color & life to the Riddler. It's truly fascinating to watch Jim go, he's really over the top here, so much so that he makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look understated. But Jim is both funny & menacing here not to mention crazy. There are many different ways you can portray the Riddler and Carrey gave a performance that's unique & all his own and he's helped by a good script that has a good story for Edward Nygma who will become the Riddler. They give Nygma his brilliance as he plans to absorb people's brainwaves making him the superior intellect. I also like the various riddler outfits he wears. Jim looks great in his skin tight green jump suit & with red hair. I love the way he twirls his cane and the scene where riddler gleefully destroys the bat-cave is awesome! He has a great laugh, and a lot great one liners. Carrey's performance is a stand out in the entire movie series. This movie has a lot great special effects, great action scenes and score, so despite not being really dark I find this to be a really good movie.

It created quite a stir on the film festival circuits including Edinburgh, Toronto and Sundance. Pulled in acclaim and derision in equal measure from that odd bread of human called movie critics, yet were not quite so divided and loved this kooky British story of love and coming out from 1999.Sixteen year-old lanky Steven Carter is a boy with a secret, he cannot tell anyone he likes boys and not girls, except of course his slightly chubby best pal Linda, who seems old before her years. Oh and the occasional older bloke he picks up at the various public bogs around town, just to add that sleazy aspect to gay life that movies like to hit with. He wants to be a writer (Don't we all sugar!) and is already on the school newspaper team. He also cannot tell anyone that he has the hot's for John, the school hunk and head boy, who without out a doubt would be called a jock if this were an American made picture. He's the sporty handsome guy with prospects that your mum longed for you to bring home after school or before a date, except he's straight. John's current squeeze is a model, but he is not short of admirers, seems the whole school get moist whenever he is around.Before long, John and Steven finally meet, not at school, but in the cubicle of the local cottage, weird, odd, yes, I mean how many times do you strike up relationships with people you bump into during a random fumble in the dirty park bogs? However, hey, this is fiction and these sorts of things happen, besides, it helps the story develop and I am not being harsh, just honest. So anyway, as I say they strike up a friendship away from the seedy toilet sex and I don't mean swapping Match sticker cards at break time either, it's a full on love fest. However, this is Britain, supposedly modern times, this is school and John is supposedly straight, so they've got to keep their little romantic liaison secret, but as we all know, with secrets come lies and deceit and what a tangled web we weave when trying to keep our private life away from public eyes. There is a lovely little scene at the school prop when they dance with each other with their eyes alone, in reality, they are dancing with their respective prop dates, but their eyes are locked on each other, which is both touching and oddly strange. However, things all work themselves out in the end, with a few little spills along the way. It really is a nice little film, even though I seem to knock it a bit, it has some important messages, not least when it raises the spectre of homophobic bullying and the harsh bitter reality of classroom taunts and sports field aggression. Dark and light go together in this film, with comic moments and serious situations simmer along side by side quite nicely. There are some weak jokes in the script that reply on old and overused campy gags you would expect from Julian Clary or Graham Norton. Not often will a films DVD cover give the whole game away, usually it's just a slight flavour, but Get Real seems to not want you to watch by spelling out in American lingo most of the films plots and interests on the cover 'What if you can't avoid sexuality, guilt, peer pressure, lies, bigots, rumours, misunderstandings, nerds, jocks, romance, loneliness, shame and insecurity? Your only choice is to get real. School's out and so is Steven Carter.' It is such a shame because you know it has already put half the audience off, and that is the half that would really benefit from seeing it. Get Real is a lovely film, some key issues are brushed upon; other's mysteriously absent, but on the whole an engaging movie of surprising depth. It has the ability to make you laugh aloud at the funny bits and tear up at some of the not so happy bits. I am sure the appeal of this movie has much to do with the reminiscent quality its storyline evokes in much of the collective minds of the audience. Many of us have had similar experiences at school, dealt with the same crap and overcome the taunts and teen angst as we battled our way through the choice of either staying safe and ultimately unrewarded in the closet. Alternatively, risking the abuse, possible gay bashing and isolation of coming out and being the only gay in the school.

Gus Van Sant essentially takes on Shakespeare's Henry IV; it featured the aesthetically delightful River Phoenix as Mike Waters, a wonderfully apt narcoleptic male whore who we first get a glimpse of tipping down an open stretch of road in Idaho. Mike and the action shifts from the cold Seattle to equally cold Portland. It is here that he makes friends with Scott Favor, a secretly soon to be rich guy who is also on the game played by the often-maligned Keanu Reeves. The future for both is as uncertain as uncertain can be, will Scott take up the inheritance he about to get, will Mike survive the streets with his narcolepsy? ￼ Mike feels real affections for Scott, however Scott refuses to believe men can really love each and it would seem that Scott is only doing the gay whole whore thing to kill time and get back at his family. Mike believes Scott will continue with the grand life on the streets, turning tricks even after he bags the inheritance; such is the allure of the unknown. There are many of fellow working boys who agree with Mike's view. This is an uneasy picture, a colourful and surreal attempt to really take the characters to a different kingdom. At times, it is a wonderful although slightly glossy take on the real street hustlers shagging their way to oblivion or not as the individual case may be. Drug abuse and risky behaviours are commonplace on the streets and in the world of the male hooker and it is a small feature of this sometimes-disturbing film. The character of Mike seems almost apologetically plausible, abandoned as a child and obsessed with finding his real long lost mother. Scott less believable as the rebellious disillusioned spoilt little rich kid gone rebelliously bad. You really would not have put them together by design, but fate disregards those lines and together they embark on a quest to find Mike's mother, from Portland to Idaho to Italy they do travel.

Village Voice said, Phoenix vanishes with reckless triumph into his role. It earned around £5 million at the box office worldwide, which is quite impressive, more than that in video and DVD sales. My Own Private Idaho takes the spirit and passion of Shakespeare, bends, manipulates and shapes it to find form in a more modern setting, which works beyond expectation in the most part.

There's not a doubt in my mind that this is Keaton's finest work. It is not his funniest, but it is certainly his most thrilling and beautiful.Orson Welles once claimed this film captured the look and feel of the American Civil War better than The Birth of a Nation (1915) or even the much loved Gone with the Wind (1939). I would have to concur. From the costumes to the sets, the whole movie reeks with authenticity. In a way, it makes it almost timeless, since the film doesn't feel dated like most other 1920s historical films which usually keep a touch of contemporary influence in the costumes and make-up (then again, this is the case with most historical pictures in general). Just as Buster himself wished, the picture is so authentic it hurts.The action aspect of The General is the highlight for me. Those stunts Buster performs are just amazing. I've seen this film at least ten times, yet I never fail to gasp and marvel at the things Buster does on that moving locomotive. And no, unlike later films, Buster is not in front of a projection; he's actually on a moving train on-location. There's no way the folks up in Hollywood would let that happen today, and that's why this film is infinitely much more impressive than the CG infested action films we have nowadays.Another wonderful part of the film is the romance. The relationship between Johnnie (Buster) and Annabelle (Marion Mack) is earthy; they both get frustrated with each other, especially on Johnnie's end. The scene which best illustrates this relationship is when Johnnie gets annoyed at Annabelle and mockingly strangles her before planting a quick kiss on her mouth. It's both funny and sweet, undoubtedly the most romantic moment in all his work.I adore this film. It is my all-time favorite. If you call yourself a film buff but haven't seen this yet, then get your butt off the couch and rent it! It's among cinema's finest.

The back and forth between Pesci and Gwynne is just so perfect that it never grows old no matter how many times you see the film. Oscar-winner Marisa Tomei is flawless in her role as the girlfriend and we get great support from Ralph Macchio, Lane Smith, Bruce McGill and Austin Pendleton. The film has so many classic sequences that the long 118-minute running time flies by without any dry or slow moments. There's no question that the film contains some of the biggest laughs of the decade and it's also fair to call this thing a classic. ","genre":"Comedy, Crime"}]
