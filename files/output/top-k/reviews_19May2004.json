[{"date":"19 May 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Wes Anderson's 1998 film is a story of love in the main. Max Fischer is a student at the private school of Rushmore, where he is failing with bad grades, and is more interested in plays and all sorts of extra curricular activities. He falls in love with a pre-school teacher, Ms Cross, but the love is unrequited, but he continues his pursuing of her. He has quite a strange mixture of friends, Dirk Calloway, a fellow student at the school, failing millionaire tycoon, Hernan Blume and Ms Cross.It follows the life of Fischer, and the ins and outs of what he gets up to. Mostly, this involves all of the societies and activities he is part of, or planning to do. Most of this seems to revolve around love in some way, and is always trying to impress Ms Cross, in some ways, it is a slightly unreal storyline as he is a fifteen-year-old boy and she is a teacher within Rushmore. The more realistic part to this storyline is the love link between Ms Cross and Blume, which Fischer does not like as both of them are his friends and he is in love with Cross.Jason Schwartzmann fits into the character of Fischer well and is refreshing in the role as it is not your typical teen movie, or your typical role for a teenager. It does not have a large cast with many big names in it, although, Bill Murray who plays the role of Blume fits in perfectly and the character seems to have been made for him. Fischer becomes somewhat obsessed with Cross, and tries too hard at making everything perfect for himself, this is partly why he gets expelled from Rushmore, and has to start a new life at a state school. When Blume also starts to fall for Cross, things go from bad to worse for Fischer and tries to get revenge on Blume, and somewhat predictably, everything works out just fine for Fischer. This is a well-directed film with a good storyline, which has its funny moments; none in particular are hilarious but some will bring a smile to your face. Overall, this was enjoyable to watch, but the plot was sometimes a little erratic with no clear direction, however, it is worth seeing for Murray's portrayal of Blume and the few comic moments within it. Although the ending is predictable, the storyline as a whole is free flowing and easy to understand.
