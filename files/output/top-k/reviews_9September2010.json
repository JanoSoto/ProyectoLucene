I think too many people believe a movie is going to be fantastic or totally bite when you really just need to take a movie for what it is and allow yourself to suspend your disbelief, and use your imagination... unless you're so bored you can't, but sometimes you just need to look at something a little closer.Well, I thought the puppets had quite a fair share of air time, but I'm surprised that no one has mentioned the biggest disappointment about it... Half of the puppet shots, (if not more) were from the first five movies. Yeah, they just recycled footage so they wouldn't have to do any extra animating. Not that they did any to begin with. Anyone could have made this movie by getting a bunch of novelty puppets or replicas from the films, about ten people they know, and filmed the puppets walking along a ledge as long as their hands weren't in the shots... that's pretty much what happened with the exception of a little bit of lightning effects at the end. And don't forget the footage ripped from the other movies. Gotta fill space, show the puppets, and not do any extra but much needed work in the process.Yeah, I have gone over all the negatives, but positives... not a whole lot. Everyone rips on the acting, but it's quality B movie acting (that would be a craft of its own). I've seen way worse. There was at least one good death scene... Maybe two. I hated the cop so much that I loved it. You just wanted to punch the cop and the bully in the face. It was great. The story was a little slow moving, but for some reason it kept my attention.

They go to warn Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), but they come to find they Naboo is already being invaded, and they must evacuate the planet, including the Queen. They head to the planet Tatooine, and happen to come across a boy named Anakin Skywalker, who is supposed to be very strong with the force. So they must take him on their journey, all while battling against Darth Sidious, the leader of the Trade Federation, and his apprentice Darth Maul.Well, I must admit, I am terribly disappointed in this film. The original three, or at least first two, are some of the greatest movies in history, and I really thought George Lucas could have done a much better job with this film. The first three had fantastic special effects, along with fantastic characters, and an obviously incredibly creative story. The only space adventure near this is Star Trek, and if you are educated on both of the series then you will know that the biggest similarity between the two is the name starts with star and they take place in space. Clearly, Lucas already has the creative story made out for him, and with yet again Oscar Worthy special effects he had to go wrong somewhere right? Yes, unfortunately he went seriously wrong with the character development. Where were the outstanding characters from the first three films? Definitely not in this movie. It really was pretty bad. The only memorable character was Darth Maul, and he barely said a word. The plot was not great either, but the story was original, so that worked out fine. But yet again, not nearly as good as the first three movies, and since this is the first movie of three that are telling us the story of how everything came to be, I think that The Phantom Menace really needed to be better than it was.Now I do not want to be too hard on the film, or George Lucas, because he brought us one of the greatest movies of all time, and he is an overall excellent director. The acting in the film was actually pretty good. Liam Neeson was of course good, as always. And Ewan McGregor was good as well. No one was Oscar Worthy, but good enough. I didn't really care for Natalie Portman's performance, not that it was bad, I just did not think it was great. She was probably the right person for the role though. Jake Lloyd was great for the part of Anakin. Everyone thinks he is cute, and even at a young age he was an excellent actor, though it is a shame we had to switch to Hayden Christensen after this first film.The special effects saved this film! With decent acting the film was alright, but without these effects I would not have cared one bit for this movie, and would have second guessed seeing the next. Especially for 1999, these special effects truly were unbelievable, which is one thing Lucas brought back from the old movies. The Phantom Menace was visually stunning, and deserved to win the Oscar for special effects.Overall, The Phantom Menace lacks severely in character development, but has a few good performances, and incredible special effects. Along with an amazing character such as Darth Maul. The movie was not terrible, but this is a legendary series, and it needs to stay that way.

Lord of the Flies documents just such a situation. The movie, adapted from William Golding's novel of the same name, is about a plane full of young British school boys that crash lands on an island. The pilot of the plane dies and the thirty something boys are left to fend for themselves and make their own rules. As lines are drawn and tribes are created and divided, chaos descends. This story delves into the dark and undisciplined, essentially animal side of the human mind. It's extremely dark and indeed frightening to watch the depths that unattended children sink to when they lose all control and authority.The story William Golding created is an absolute incredible one that goes so much farther into the psyche of the adolescent than most dare to go. Unfortunately the film adaptation of this epic tale does not even begin to do the source material justice. It is a poorly executed attempt at bringing Golding's novel to a new medium. My biggest complaint with this film would have to be the acting. The direction is somewhat shoddy and the sound mixing is particularly frustrating (even though I read all the sound had to be overdubbed because the ocean drowned out everything while filming) but the acting is the biggest issue. The child actors all seem to regurgitate their lines, giving the film a stale feel without any substance to lines which are meant to be harrowing and dramatic. During the entire first and second act the acting is tense and feels very forced, whilst the actors are being completely unenthusiastic. In a film about children losing control and going absolutely mad with power and freedom, the acting should be much more restless and I kept thinking these kids needed to be more hyperactive and significantly less subdued.Leading into the final act there is a very significant and very obvious shift in tone. The story turns from an innocent one about lost children, to a terrifying psychological study. It was here that the highlights of the film came from. There were some scenes that delivered in a dark and cynical way, and for that I can appreciate the effort only slightly more. After this dark turn the film started to improve at points, but then would seem to drop back down to that subdued level of lackluster acting. By the end of the film I felt robbed of what could have been a great adaptation of a fantastic story. But by the ending, which was still well done, I realized that the character relationships were still underdeveloped, as well as the underlying themes of the story. They weren't absent from the story, but they could have gone much further.All the right elements are present in Lord of the Flies but they are all very underdeveloped and the film does not achieve its full potential. Poor acting and a lack of enthusiasm hurt an extremely well crafted psychological experience that had so much potential.

There isn't just one main story but rather we get to see Harry Callahan in various situations, doing his daily routine as a cop, coming across various challenges with his superiors and such but then at the heart is this intense mystery and thriller about a rogue cop (or cops) killing mobsters, villains and others. The best thing about Magnum Force is just watching Harry in his element. Ultimately it helps us understand more about this vivacious character that seemed to work on the brink of madness in the first film doing anything he can to clear the streets of 'scum.' In the end the film humanizes him much more and perhaps it would seem he has a little less edge to him but in a good way if that makes sense. Whereas the original Dirty Harry really captured San Francisco and brought it to life, the follow up doesn't really utilize the San Francisco backdrop as much. Its still present but just not as vividly used. This one is all about the cops and their lives and Harry's interaction with them.Harry Callahan is probably one of the amazing Clint Eastwood's best characters with the most depth and really larger than life on screen. He doesn't grumble and grunt his way through the role (and nobody loves his grumbling and grunting more than me) but instead Harry is full of life and passion and a true determination to do what is needed no matter what. This fills in everything you wanted to know about Harry from the first film. Legendary character actor Hal Holbrook joins the force as Harry's nemesis and Lieutenant. He goes toe to toe with Eastwood repeatedly in a battle of wits and holds his own. Holbrook probably gives easily the second best performance in the film next to Eastwood especially in the latter part of the film. Mitch Ryan plays Eastwood's friend of years Charlie McCoy who is going through many problems emotionally. I wish Ryan had a far bigger part because I think he was excellent in the one big scene he gets and could have really done great in the film. Tim Matheson is also a familiar face in character acting and is solid as a hot headed young traffic officer hellbent on cleaning up the streets. He should also get more screen time. Same can be said for Felton Perry who plays Harry's partner Early. I suppose when you're sidekick to Dirty Harry himself you are bound to take a backseat but I would have liked to have seen more of him.So my biggest issue with Magnum Force can be summed up in that the supporting actors could have been used so much more than they were. Also the ridiculous romance forced into the story with Harry and his neighbour is not only unnecessary but completely out of whack with the story. Unlike the first film Harry doesn't have a clear cut enemy or villain. There isn't just one killer although for awhile he is represented by one of the officer vigilantes. Still he isn't just being chased or chasing down one serial killer but a group of his own really amping up the tension in the film. The climax goes beyond that of the original including a huge twist to the film, a high speed car chase, and an epic shoot out worthy of an Eastwood film. Director Ted Post came from a heavy background in Television and it shows in his style for Magnum Force but it works perfectly fine for the film. I did score Magnum Force higher than Dirty Harry because in several ways it is better. Exploring Callahan as a character makes this one superior. The climax is even better, as mentioned, and it simply is a great thriller\/mystery\/cop drama and makes for a great film. A man's got to know his limitations...

Its still present but just not as vividly used. This one is all about the cops and their lives and Harry's interaction with them.Harry Callahan is probably one of the amazing Clint Eastwood's best characters with the most depth and really larger than life on screen. He doesn't grumble and grunt his way through the role (and nobody loves his grumbling and grunting more than me) but instead Harry is full of life and passion and a true determination to do what is needed no matter what. This fills in everything you wanted to know about Harry from the first film. Legendary character actor Hal Holbrook joins the force as Harry's nemesis and Lieutenant. He goes toe to toe with Eastwood repeatedly in a battle of wits and holds his own. Holbrook probably gives easily the second best performance in the film next to Eastwood especially in the latter part of the film. Mitch Ryan plays Eastwood's friend of years Charlie McCoy who is going through many problems emotionally. I wish Ryan had a far bigger part because I think he was excellent in the one big scene he gets and could have really done great in the film. Tim Matheson is also a familiar face in character acting and is solid as a hot headed young traffic officer hellbent on cleaning up the streets. He should also get more screen time. Same can be said for Felton Perry who plays Harry's partner Early. I suppose when you're sidekick to Dirty Harry himself you are bound to take a backseat but I would have liked to have seen more of him.So my biggest issue with Magnum Force can be summed up in that the supporting actors could have been used so much more than they were. Also the ridiculous romance forced into the story with Harry and his neighbour is not only unnecessary but completely out of whack with the story. Unlike the first film Harry doesn't have a clear cut enemy or villain. There isn't just one killer although for awhile he is represented by one of the officer vigilantes. Still he isn't just being chased or chasing down one serial killer but a group of his own really amping up the tension in the film. The climax goes beyond that of the original including a huge twist to the film, a high speed car chase, and an epic shoot out worthy of an Eastwood film. Director Ted Post came from a heavy background in Television and it shows in his style for Magnum Force but it works perfectly fine for the film. I did score Magnum Force higher than Dirty Harry because in several ways it is better. Exploring Callahan as a character makes this one superior. The climax is even better, as mentioned, and it simply is a great thriller\/mystery\/cop drama and makes for a great film. A man's got to know his limitations... Man I love Eastwood. 8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Crime, Mystery"},{"date":"9 September 2010","score":"6 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" This is the first silent film I have ever seen, so I really was not use to having absolutely no sound (other than the piano in the background) in a 90 minute movie.

I was diagnosed with autism a long time ago. Because of this, I have tougher standards when it comes to movies that deal with mental or physical disabilities. Too often, I see films patronize these people as saints, even when they do almost nothing for themselves throughout the film. In my view, when it comes to dealing with disadvantaged people, I feel these figures should honestly overcome the odds despite or even because of their disabilities, or be recognized for whom they are (in a supporting light) for both their good and not so good traits (Rain Man takes the latter approach). I have no qualms when I say that I was not inspired by the based on true events stories of The Elephant Man, Radio, and The Blind Side, because I felt these movies patronized disadvantaged people whom I felt had little agency for themselves.But, Rain Man, on the other hand, gets it right. Almost EXACTLY right. And it gets a rare 10\/10 from me too.Let's start with the treatment of the Raymond Babbit character. He has mid-functioning autism, and he will be like that for the rest of his life. Though he's quick with math and card counting, he will never understand the concept of money or be able to function on his own. And the film wisely does not set him up as a figure to be hailed. Admired? Perhaps. All the same though, while Raymond does grow a little in that he allows a little more flexibility into his daily schedule and begins to share a bond with brother Charlie, he's still a mostly static character has some very positive (math and memorization) and very frustrating (takes things too literally, obsessive fears of the unknown world) characteristics.The real hero of the film, is his brother Charlie. And Charlie undergoes a REAL transformation. You actually watch him grow and change as he forces himself to take care of his brother. By the time he was trying to make a case to become his brother's guardian, I honestly believed his words and felt he had undergone a dramatic, yet subtle, change. The film handles his arc very delicately here; lots of small moments lead to the progression of his character.As almost everyone has stated before, the acting is superb in this picture. Dustin Hoffman is perfect as Raymond, absolutely perfect. His facial ticks, his refusal to look into eyes, his meltdown when he hears the smoke detector, it's all there. He truly sets a golden standard when it comes to playing autistic characters, or any character with a mental disability, for that matter. And Tom Cruise is perfectly cast as the yuppie brother Charlie. Admittedly, this does play right into his 1980's persona. But the way he transforms from being so immature and ignorant to becoming a caring person is so honest, so well done. I know it's easy to bash Tom Cruise these days, but when I watch this movie, I can't help but hold very high admiration for him.Rain Man has held up well since it's 1988 release (my year of birth, in fact). Even today, though we know far more about autism, Rain Man still remains a smart insight into the condition. Rain Man gets both its story, and the issue of autism, RIGHT. And that is why it will continue to be appreciated by generations of film viewers for years to come.(Oh, and did I mention that Hans Zimmer's film score, his first to be nominated for an Oscar, is awesome as well?)

It was big in terms of the amount it cost to make, a then-record $15 million. (This record was to be shattered four years later by another epic, Cleopatra, which cost around three times as much). It was big in the sense that it was made on a grand scale; grandeur was generally a hallmark of the epic genre, but Ben-Hur is the grandest of the grand. And it was big in terms of its success, both at the box-office and at the Academy Awards, where it won a record eleven Oscars, a feat since equalled but never surpassed.The film is an example of what might be called the post-biblical epic. Such films (other examples include The Robe, Quo Vadis? and The Silver Chalice) were popular in the fifties and told fictional stories based upon the early years of the Christian Church. The protagonist, Judah Ben-Hur, is a wealthy Jewish aristocrat living in Jerusalem at the time of Christ. He is sent to the galleys as a slave, and his mother and sister imprisoned, after they are falsely accused of attempting to assassinate the Roman Governor of Judea. The man who condemns them, the military tribune Messala, was Ben-Hur's childhood friend, but the two have quarrelled and are now bitter enemies. (The cause of their quarrel was Ben-Hur's refusal to name those Jews who are hostile to the Roman authorities; was this a veiled reference to McCarthyism?) The story then follows Ben-Hur's further adventures; as a galley slave he saves the life of the Roman commander and is rewarded with his freedom and becomes the man's adopted son. He is obsessed, however, by his desire for revenge against Messala and to discover what has happened to his mother and sister. Like Lew Wallace's novel on which it is based, the film has an explicitly religious theme, and the story of Ben-Hur is told against the background of the ministry of Jesus and the birth of Christianity.During my youth in the seventies and eighties the epic was deeply unfashionable. Spartacus was sometimes mentioned as an honourable exception because of the general esteem in which Stanley Kubrick was held, but others of the genre were often mocked as vulgar and overblown, soap operas on a colossal scale. This attitude, however, has changed over the last two decades, especially since Gladiator, the first great modern epic, won the Oscar for Best Picture. The genre (like all film genres) could vary enormously in quality- The Silver Chalice, for example, is a particularly poor example- but the great epics like Ben-Hur are now much more widely appreciated than they once were.That does not mean it is a perfect film; it falls just short of the perfect 10 mark; in particular, some of the minor characters are not so good. The obscure Israeli actress Haya Harareet, for example, seems rather flat as Ben-Hur's love-interest Esther; her casting, moreover, spoils the pattern whereby all the Jewish characters have American accents and all the Roman characters British ones. Hugh Griffith's Arab sheikh today looks more like an embarrassing ethnic stereotype than an Oscar-wining performance. (Griffiths won for Best Supporting Actor, although George C Scott was much better in Anatomy of a Murder).Those, however, would be my only criticisms. Charlton Heston is today perhaps the actor most associated with the epic style and starred in what I would regard as three of the four greatest epics, The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur and El Cid. (Spartacus is the fourth). Here he not only brings the required strength and dignity to the title role but also makes a great action hero. (Among other things he learned to drive a chariot for the part). His Best Actor Oscar was certainly well-deserved, and it is strange to think that he only got the part after several others turned it down. There are good supporting performances from, among others, Jack Hawkins as Arrius and Stephen Boyd as the villainous Messala whose cynical Realpolitik leads him to betray his old friend. (Incidentally, I do not believe Gore Vidal's story of a hidden subplot about a gay relationship between Messala and Ben-Hur, with Boyd and William Wyler but not Heston in on the secret, if only because Vidal was simply recycling an old theatrical anecdote about Tyrone Guthrie, Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson).One of those who turned down the leading role was Burt Lancaster, who allegedly didn't like the violent morals in the story. (Paul Newman turned it down on the grounds that his legs didn't look good in a tunic- probably a polite way of saying that he didn't want to do another epic after the disastrous Silver Chalice). If the story about Lancaster is correct, I doubt if he can have read the script to the end, because the film emphatically conveys a Christian message of forgiveness over revenge. (It's a lot less violent than some of Lancaster's own films from this period). Yet unlike many films (including some epics) with a religious theme the religious content never becomes preachy or intrusive. The general ethos can perhaps be described as muscular Christianity, a combination of Christian morality with a gripping adventure story. And nowhere does it become more gripping than in that famous chariot race, perhaps the greatest single action sequence ever filmed. The film is worth 9\/10 for that alone.On a final note, Miklós Rózsa's musical score also comes close to justifying that mark by itself.

Charlton Heston is today perhaps the actor most associated with the epic style and starred in what I would regard as three of the four greatest epics, The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur and El Cid. (Spartacus is the fourth). Here he not only brings the required strength and dignity to the title role but also makes a great action hero. (Among other things he learned to drive a chariot for the part). His Best Actor Oscar was certainly well-deserved, and it is strange to think that he only got the part after several others turned it down. There are good supporting performances from, among others, Jack Hawkins as Arrius and Stephen Boyd as the villainous Messala whose cynical Realpolitik leads him to betray his old friend. (Incidentally, I do not believe Gore Vidal's story of a hidden subplot about a gay relationship between Messala and Ben-Hur, with Boyd and William Wyler but not Heston in on the secret, if only because Vidal was simply recycling an old theatrical anecdote about Tyrone Guthrie, Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson).One of those who turned down the leading role was Burt Lancaster, who allegedly didn't like the violent morals in the story. (Paul Newman turned it down on the grounds that his legs didn't look good in a tunic- probably a polite way of saying that he didn't want to do another epic after the disastrous Silver Chalice). If the story about Lancaster is correct, I doubt if he can have read the script to the end, because the film emphatically conveys a Christian message of forgiveness over revenge. (It's a lot less violent than some of Lancaster's own films from this period). Yet unlike many films (including some epics) with a religious theme the religious content never becomes preachy or intrusive. The general ethos can perhaps be described as muscular Christianity, a combination of Christian morality with a gripping adventure story. And nowhere does it become more gripping than in that famous chariot race, perhaps the greatest single action sequence ever filmed. The film is worth 9\/10 for that alone.On a final note, Miklós Rózsa's musical score also comes close to justifying that mark by itself.

By the time the film had bedded down into this, rather literally, one on one scenario between the powers of good and evil, locked away within the confinement of a young girl's bedroom, I was worn out in all the right ways and there was still much more to come. The film fascinatingly and meticulously balances the plight of a handful of characters caught up with one another whilst on the front-line of a case involving the possession of a young girl by a demon. It details the agony and confusion at what might be wrong with her, by those close to her, right the way through to the plight of a police detective wanting to solve the cases of a handful of murders perpetrated by said spirit; all of it wonderfully well and without ever over tilting the emphasis on any one story.The film will begin in The Middle East, specifically Iraq, and an archaeologist is undergoing a large dig with dozens of locals in searching for something which is eventually found. The sense that the archaeologist has been there for a fair while, in attempting to find what it was he was looking for, is put across by way of his arriving at some ancient ruins before having some armed guards retreat upon seeing whom it actually is that has hared up to their entrance in a jeep. His time away from home and in this location suggests a great importance surrounding the item he's searching for, an importance that we feel has seen this elderly man sacrifice most of his later years in looking for it. What he finds appears to be more than a mere physical item, the apparent fever that follows his uncovering of a small fist sized trinket having him suddenly become aware of all the relatively uncanny iconography in the form of gargoyles and such when around the ancient ruins he clearly frequents often enough. If, for all that time, the said items did not all that much bother him as they tower over the general locale, then we most certainly feel something must be inherently wrong for him to be affected, scared even, by them now.Friedkin fools us into thinking this is a film about this archaeologist whom uncovered more than he thought he would in the desert. In cutting to a quaint American suburb in the town of Georgetown, Washington; the director executes his first effective gear change in tone, study and general content as the lives of an American actress in Chris MacNeil (Burstyn) and her daughter Regan (Blair) are focused on. They dwell in a large, detached house; have a healthy family relationship with one another and the domestic bliss that is this cushy American suburban existence in a really pleasant area seems too good to be true. Another major player in proceedings is young priest Damien Karras (Miller), somebody whose faith to his profession is itself under threat and whose mother is elderly and frail. The boxing trophies, his photographs and the general mise-en-scene of his small apartment in a rough neighbourhood suggests he was once a fighter, a scrapper and apparently quite good at it. A glance at his exterior surroundings and the sorts of people whom inhabit it on the career paths they are twinned with a gradual revealing of the kindhearted manner he exudes suggests a resilience through adversity; an ability to become a priest over a thief or criminal and that he may have fought a fair few battles in his time thus nicely setting things up for later duels.The inclusion of Karras is another element Friedkin introduces still without revealing a discernible pattern to proceedings nor in which the direction the film is heading. We are challenged to form a correlation between the three parties, left hanging on the fate of the early archaeologist and left questioning whose story it is. As things unravel Regan becomes ill and the doctor discerns it as an interior problem of a scientific nature which can be treated despite Regan's claims and pleas. In providing us with a 'sick' character during the opening and wonderfully establishing the extent as to which the illness affected him before cutting away without much resolution, the rendering of Regan as unwell has us wonder as to the extent it will affect her and her ability as this young girl to deal with something that it's been previously established has a powerful affect on people.In years gone by, it might have been crude to ruin what it is that forces Regan to become as ill as she does; needless to say in case you're unaware, the issue is less so a scientific one than it is one of a theological nature. As the rest of the characters are left guessing, police Lieutenant William Kinderman (Cobb) is introduced to the text, Friedkin shooting one of his exchanges with Karras beside a tennis court after previously having them get along rather nicely; the use of the court in the background and link to tennis has us think of a tennis match, specifically a one on one match of gamesmanship unfolding on top of all this other activity as Karras and Kinderman clash over the investigating of the death of a British film-maker linked to Chris. The final act sees Friedkin go for the kill, cracking on ahead with a terrifying series of scenes which work gloriously and round off a wonderful directorial job. The film, essentially a battle between good and evil, is rich in disturbing imagery without being exploitative and high drama covering a number of strands and arcs, all of which work. The Exorcist is a superb thriller, running on controversial subject matter and the brilliant direction required to hit levels of this ilk.

In a graphic, unflinching and intelligently crafted 24 minutes of intense combat, Hanks' Captain Miller attempts to lead a scattered battalion up the Normandy dunes where the German's have strategically set up a prime and virtually impenetrable defense, made up of turrets and other artillery which they fire unceasingly at the landing soldiers. This sequence has been lauded, justifiably, as possibly the most realistic, not to mention enthralling, WWII battle scene ever made. A nonstop, action-packed spectacle of epic proportions, this opening absorbs the viewer to the extent that the experience becomes a predominantly visceral one, where everything on screen is felt rather than seen or heard. When the soldiers begin to yell military jargon to each other amidst their chaotic surroundings, much of which is either inaudible or incomprehensible, the instinctive understanding between the characters and the viewer is mutual We're getting shot at, so shoot back&#x85; harder! During these times when the characters take time to stop and confer with one another, it is refreshing to see Spielberg defy war- movie convention by not also causing the turmoil around them to cease many a soldier is cut off mid-sentence by an unfortunately aimed bullet\/mortar shell. And, as if positioning the camera in amongst this pandemonium would not suffice, Spielberg goes to great lengths to ensure that the audience feels not only like a spectator to this event but a borderline participant; techniques such as allowing a free-fall of water and blood onto the camera and the incorporation of a smouldering grainy effect on the lens that seems to elongate and redefine every stroke of light and colour on screen add to the experience.Spielberg's meticulous attention-to-detail is a distinctive aspect of his directing style that informs much of the Omaha Beach landing as there's a strong notion while watching that every one of the hundreds of extras on screen is briefed on the scene as fully as possible, being instructed on precisely when and where to shoot, scream, fall, die etc. This, amongst other Spielberg traits, is the mark of a brilliant director and a quality that no doubt won him his second Best Director statue, along with his uncharacteristic choosing of such mature subject matter as in his previous win for Schindler's List five years earlier.Saving Private Ryan is, at its foundation, a thrilling and rewarding film that succeeds in exhilarating the audience and fulfilling the needs of any adrenaline junkies who happen to be watching. What sets the film apart from a vast category of movies that also achieve this merit is that when the action stops the viewers interest doesn't. This is attributed to the snappily flowing and probable dialogue that never degrades itself enough to be necessary; if any quality of a film is ever more appropriately ordained necessary as opposed to entertaining, rest assured it definitely could've been better. Granted, everyone could have gone without Hanks' speech about the horrors of war and his longing for home, the only truly disingenuous moment of the entire film, manufactured solely for usage at awards ceremonies as a short to accompany Hanks' nominations. But this single scene, try as it might, thankfully does not derail the rest of the film's engaging, at times funny and insightful script; in fact, in being surrounded by such brilliance, Hanks' monologue even becomes somewhat endearing with repeat viewings.Saving Private Ryan, a gem in its own right, is heightened to further planes of excellence by a cast of great variety and, at the time, predominant obscurity, with the exceptions of Hanks, Tom Sizemore and Matt Damon. Nevertheless, each and every one of the mainly young and inexperienced actors that make up Miller's unit are given a chance to prove themselves worthy of their time on screen modern day action hero Vin Diesel's dying Caparzo pleading for one of his friends to shelter a letter for his father; the eerily captivating Ribsi's Wade speaking of his long-tempered guilt at having deceived his mother; Davies' Upham silently crumbling into a self-loathing, hysterical mess, unable to summon the courage to shoot an enemy soldier; virtually anytime that Goldberg's Mellish and Pepper's Jackson speak, with their casual humour, stoic sorrow and startling arrogance that is as involving as any other character. Ed Burns as Reiben, the largest supporting role, initiates the first of what has resulted in a typecast career and a slew of hardened, defiant, almost bad-boy roles. He shatters this façade only once to speak of a beautiful and, most pertinently, curvaceous woman he knows back home whom he thinks of whenever he finds the war around him too much to bear. Sizemore is walking familiar ground as the toughened and ripened authoritarian support, but at least there is a dimension to his character, unseen in the ill-fated Pearl Harbour. Matt Damon in the brief role of Private Ryan is outstanding in his ability to connect with the audience, especially the anecdote he tells involving his three brothers, persuading surprisingly comfortable laughter and a touching sense of loss. Tom Hanks' fine portrayal of Captain Miller is a truly original character in which there is no hint of the tender Forrest Gump or the jaded but honest Charlie Wilson; Miller is a testament to Hanks' wide and impressive spectrum, which is made abundantly clear anyway by virtually every film he appears in.An audience-pleasing endeavour that offers as much excitement as it does quaint and unexpected intimacy, Saving Private Ryan is a war film that never seeks to glorify itself, but rather acknowledge that great things can sprout from even the sh*ttiest situations.

Its famous fancy gun play and choreographed flight scenes attracted a huge amount of attention from international viewers. Bruce Lee effectively established Asian martial art films back in 1970s, it was the reboot of the Hong Kong film industry and soon the martial art films became very popular. Then Kung Fu films are stamped Oriental identity. The Hong Kong film industry reached its golden time between 1986 and 1992. It had the third largest film production after India and the United States. Many of us get to know Jackie Chan in the Hollywood action comedy blockbuster Rush Hour in 1998. This film made a star of Jackie Chan internationally. Jackie Chan entered Hollywood after he succeeded in the Hong Kong film market by his martial art\/ Kung Fu performances. Many western viewers were introduced by Bruce Lee to Chinese Kung Fu - Asian martial art films. Hence a lot of people compare Jackie Chan with Bruce Lee's performances. In earlier days Jackie Chan was not actually doing much acting in the action films. He was a stuntman in Bruce Lee's film New Fist of the Fury and Enter the Dragon. Later on he was discovered by a film maker and tried to promote his Kung Fu performance which differentiated him from Bruce Lee's This is Chinese Kung fu image. His first breakthrough &#x96; Drunken Master in the Hong Kong film market earned him high ratings from Chinese audiences. It is one of the earliest action comedies that stared Jackie Chan. This film is no exception to his other action comedies &#x96; hilarious and loads of fun. It has to be a Kung Fu fans' favorite movie. The fights are inspiring for the ordinary viewers like me. Silly jokes make this film work. It involves many different and difficult Kung Fu styles and techniques. It can be classified as one of Chan's pure martial art performance films. The story is based on a Chinese hero Wong Fei Hung. What we do know about him is that he is born in Guangdong Fo Shang in Qing Dynasty and he is a Kung Fu master. There are at least 200 films made in China based on this man. Drunken Master is more like a fiction movie with a comedy twist. It is set in later Qing dynasty before the Japanese invasion. As we know, Qing government is pretty corrupt and the poor get bullied by the rich. Therefore a hero is created to save the poor and the weak. Wong's dad is also a Kung Fu Master, different from the style that Wong was taught. He is kind and brave and he teaches young men in the village to protect themselves. He wants his own son to be the same as him, but Wong Fei Hung is too naughty to be taught by his own dad. The story is mainly about the young Wong Fei Hung played by Jackie Chan and how he is transformed by his master Su Hua Zi and becomes successful in this particular sort of Kung Fu &#x96; being drunk and unbeatable at the same time. He saves his dad from being killed at the end. It is a typical story that all Chinese loves - naughty boy turn out to be a good man. Confucian tenet is still part of the guideline for these older films &#x96; respect the seniors and be a good man. Many of us have heard of this particular Kung Fu style a lot but never actually seen it. Jackie Chan has provided us a full demonstration of it with style. The film maker also captures how hard Jackie Chan was made to practice again and again on the same basics techniques. It was overwhelming to watch. It is similar to a scene in Farewell, My concubine &#x96; Kids are made to practice on basics, otherwise they will get punished for their laziness. There are lots of Chinese movie showing this traditional belief &#x96; the harder you practice, the more you get from it. No doubt Jackie Chan was young and had been trained; still, doing pushups with the wrists turning up and down at the same time as the legs up the air are not easy. I just cannot bear to think how much damage it causes to the hands for the sake of the film. The director, Yuen Woo-ping, has been actively involved in Hollywood blockbusters in recent years, for example, The Matrix series (1999-2003), Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) and the Kill Bill volumes (2003-2004). This film is his second film as a director. It is also a corner stone, establishing his career as an action movie director in the Hong Kong filming industry. He was a martial arts choreographer turned director. Hence he was keen to prove his knowledge of different and difficult Kung Fu styles to the audience. Unlike Bruce Lee's films, his film doesn't involve much political elements. So it is easy to watch. I personally think his way of shooting this film is rather raw, more like jumping one chapter to another without much connection. The screen resolution of the movie was low and the colour quality was dull back in 1978. Generally the acting is stiff, and the conversions are predictable except his martial art performance is spotless from my personal point of view. Comparing this earlier film with the films he did in recent years, there is a lot more Kung Fu and less talking in these earlier films. This film is also known as a low budget film. Not much had been invested on sets, makeup or costumes; its success comes from the witty dialogue and plenty of Kung Fu.

And it is. This is one of the first full wide screen Technicolor movies, and it's one drawback might be that it is trying to apply a new format to an old and slightly tired genre. The fact it rises above its familiarity is to Stewart's credit and Mann's. Lang (who photographed an extraordinary number of great black and white films) trades stately perfect color and design for pure drama and intensity, which are very different things, but it gives a full backdrop to the high drama here.This is a beautiful movie, for sure, in its restrained way. (The fact that it's restrained when the whole world is gaping for surging new big color movies is a small miracle in itself.) Mann did a number of westerns, for which he's most known, and a few other genre pics, but first made his name as a film minor film noir director. He seems to carry over enough of the edginess and cruelty of those noirs to make his Westerns exciting rather than epic, which is a good thing. He and Stewart worked together on five westerns, and they have taken on a life of their own, and a feeling of their own that's impressive once you click into it. One of the best noir elements to the story (which was not written by Mann) is the feeling of the lone man against the world, a great theme.The key woman lead is a cliché, the widow hanging on against the odds in town. In this case she is a charming but slightly miscast Cathy O'Donnell, a favorite of mine who takes demur and innocent to the heights. You see from the outset that this widow and Stewart's good, hard working character are destined for some kind of meeting of destinies. And there are inevitable clichés, too, that you might get used to--the stoic Indians, the older woman as tough as nails (and a gem of a role), a patriarch with a thoughtful wise look that shows counteracting wisdom, and fistfights in the dust. It's all great stuff, in the Western mold. (One fight is right in the middle of a mooing herd of cattle, and it's pretty fun.) You do wonder sometime at the possibility of a super nice guy sticking it out against all these obstacles, and I mean obstacles. The domineering (and sometimes evil) family led by Donald Crisp, with the always impressive Arthur Kennedy as the chief hand, seems like more than a man could handle. But the conflict is real, and the movie makes it pertinent beyond being just a western. And beautifully done. Even if you don't like westerns, this will grab you anyway.

However it was not a film noir, it was not a melodrama (as many reviewers have classified it here). It was a tragedy. And what tragedy it was! - prompting me to write my first review on the site.From my point of view Mildred Pierce tells the story of a woman too strong and stubborn, unable to yield to the discernment of her husband. In a sense the movie is a story about women's liberation Mildred breaks many taboos of the 40ies driving her husband out, yielding to sex with another man while still married, being the active party to pursue a divorce, becoming a successful businesswoman and remarrying. But to what end? To protect her selfish and spoiled daughter Veda, who grows ever more despising of her mother the more Mildred tries to provide for her.Aside from the frame report involving murder the story begins to fold from Mildred and her freshly unemployed husband Bert getting into a quarrel over household money, which Mildred has earned herself by selling pies for neighbours. Instead of using the money to pay for bills as Bert would have it, Mildred has bought Veda a dress (which Veda soon despises because it is too cheap.) In the ensuing conflict with Bert Mildred holds her own head. This results in the unemployed Bert moving away from the family home - which Mildred unemotionally accedes to. I see this as the stroll of the strong woman over a man whose self-esteem has been weakened by the circumstances, reflecting the changing role of the sexes in the society in general, when the man whose role has traditionally been to bring bread to the table while being the man in the house is driven to concede his position as the supporting force of both the household and general society. But does this change bring happiness? The answer of director Michael Curtiz is in my opinion a resounding NO. While Mildred is able to grow from an unskilled housewife into a successful businesswoman with a restaurant chain of her own, she is unable to exercise the needed authority at her own home. Mildred's 'motherly love' to her daughter Veda that pushed her into conflicting and driving away her husband consists of trying to serve Veda's every spoiled demand. But without boundary setting fatherly love Veda only grows to hate and despise her mother more and more, finally wishing to escape from the all-encompassing and all-forgiving tyranny of Mildred's motherly embrace.In my opinion the message of the movie is to demonstrate what happens in the family and society in general when the ordinary working family man is pushed out and is not present to suppress the whimsy behaviour of girls growing into young women. This is aptly demonstrated by the upper class playboy Monty Beragon who enters the life of the family becoming for a time Mildred's lover while actually trying to get into Veda's pants and milking every available penny (and finally her successful restaurant chain) out of Mildred's hands. This morally depraved character who capitalizes on the sexual freedom of the liberated woman with his inherited status and swinging lifestyle with which the ordinary man stripped of his role as the head of family cannot compete, replaces the father Bert as the role model whom Veda looks up to and aspires to imitate for her peril.Most of the reviewers at this site have for some incomprehensible reason seen Mildred either as the victim or a non-responsible object of melodramatic turns and twists. However in my opinion it is clear that Mildred is the actual culprit in the movie Veda growing up the way she does is the result of Mildred's actions. Note, that Bert's supposed cheating with Ms. Binderhof is never shown. It is Mildred who brings up the accusation, while it may be, that Bert is at that point only looking for a listening ear which Mildred does not provide, not necessary anything more. In the final parts of the movie Binderhof marries, but not Bert. When Mildred asks for divorce, Bert refuses, and agrees only after having witnessed Mildred's relationship with Beragon. Even after Mildred has remarried and supposedly murdered her second husband Bert is chivalrously willing to take the blame for the murder. Mildred's affair with Beragon on the other hand, while being separated but still married with Bert who refuses to divorce, is shown in detail. The negative morality of the deed is illustrated by the death of daughter Kay immediately after.I found the movie a most interesting commentary on the demise of traditional values and the mayhem that follows. It may be that those who see Mildred as a victim of an unsatisfactory husband or melodramatic circumstances have grown so far from traditional concepts such as lifelong marriage that they are no longer able to comprehend the underlying ethical framework. From my opinion the movie is an insightful early commentary on the changes the woman's liberation was causing in the society. One of the few movies to receive 10 \/ 10 from me.

This is aptly demonstrated by the upper class playboy Monty Beragon who enters the life of the family becoming for a time Mildred's lover while actually trying to get into Veda's pants and milking every available penny (and finally her successful restaurant chain) out of Mildred's hands. This morally depraved character who capitalizes on the sexual freedom of the liberated woman with his inherited status and swinging lifestyle with which the ordinary man stripped of his role as the head of family cannot compete, replaces the father Bert as the role model whom Veda looks up to and aspires to imitate for her peril.Most of the reviewers at this site have for some incomprehensible reason seen Mildred either as the victim or a non-responsible object of melodramatic turns and twists. However in my opinion it is clear that Mildred is the actual culprit in the movie Veda growing up the way she does is the result of Mildred's actions. Note, that Bert's supposed cheating with Ms. Binderhof is never shown. It is Mildred who brings up the accusation, while it may be, that Bert is at that point only looking for a listening ear which Mildred does not provide, not necessary anything more. In the final parts of the movie Binderhof marries, but not Bert. When Mildred asks for divorce, Bert refuses, and agrees only after having witnessed Mildred's relationship with Beragon. Even after Mildred has remarried and supposedly murdered her second husband Bert is chivalrously willing to take the blame for the murder. Mildred's affair with Beragon on the other hand, while being separated but still married with Bert who refuses to divorce, is shown in detail. The negative morality of the deed is illustrated by the death of daughter Kay immediately after.I found the movie a most interesting commentary on the demise of traditional values and the mayhem that follows. It may be that those who see Mildred as a victim of an unsatisfactory husband or melodramatic circumstances have grown so far from traditional concepts such as lifelong marriage that they are no longer able to comprehend the underlying ethical framework. From my opinion the movie is an insightful early commentary on the changes the woman's liberation was causing in the society. One of the few movies to receive 10 \/ 10 from me.

However it was not a film noir, it was not a melodrama (as many reviewers have classified it here). It was a tragedy. And what tragedy it was! - prompting me to write my first review on the site.From my point of view Mildred Pierce tells the story of a woman too strong and stubborn, unable to yield to the discernment of her husband. In a sense the movie is a story about women's liberation Mildred breaks many taboos of the 40ies driving her husband out, yielding to sex with another man while still married, being the active party to pursue a divorce, becoming a successful businesswoman and remarrying. But to what end? To protect her selfish and spoiled daughter Veda, who grows ever more despising of her mother the more Mildred tries to provide for her.Aside from the frame report involving murder the story begins to fold from Mildred and her freshly unemployed husband Bert getting into a quarrel over household money, which Mildred has earned herself by selling pies for neighbours. Instead of using the money to pay for bills as Bert would have it, Mildred has bought Veda a dress (which Veda soon despises because it is too cheap.) In the ensuing conflict with Bert Mildred holds her own head. This results in the unemployed Bert moving away from the family home - which Mildred unemotionally accedes to. I see this as the stroll of the strong woman over a man whose self-esteem has been weakened by the circumstances, reflecting the changing role of the sexes in the society in general, when the man whose role has traditionally been to bring bread to the table while being the man in the house is driven to concede his position as the supporting force of both the household and general society. But does this change bring happiness? The answer of director Michael Curtiz is in my opinion a resounding NO. While Mildred is able to grow from an unskilled housewife into a successful businesswoman with a restaurant chain of her own, she is unable to exercise the needed authority at her own home. Mildred's 'motherly love' to her daughter Veda that pushed her into conflicting and driving away her husband consists of trying to serve Veda's every spoiled demand. But without boundary setting fatherly love Veda only grows to hate and despise her mother more and more, finally wishing to escape from the all-encompassing and all-forgiving tyranny of Mildred's motherly embrace.In my opinion the message of the movie is to demonstrate what happens in the family and society in general when the ordinary working family man is pushed out and is not present to suppress the whimsy behaviour of girls growing into young women.

I thought this was as brilliant as Rocky I and II. Why I give this such a high rating is that Rocky V reverts to a similar formula of the first two of the story not just focusing on the boxing but the characters and that's what Rocky V does.The basic story continues after the fourth with Rocky (Stallone) coming home after his fight with the Russian boxer. He and his wife Adrian (Talia Shire) along with her brother Paulie (Burt Young) are greeted by the media when loudmouth George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) who is a boxing promoter comes along with his boxer to challenge Rocky to defend his title but he refuses as he announce to the media he is retiring. Things become bad for Rocky as he finds out he had irreversible brain damage if he continues to fight, it could kill him. They get even worse when Paulie makes an investment with Rocky's money with a crooked accountant and they lose everything like their house and they have to move back to Philadelphia where they move back into Pualie's house and Adrian gets her old job back at the pet shop part time. Meanwhile a young up and coming boxer Tommy machine gun Gunn asks Rocky to be his coaching manager and eventually he agrees as the kid steadily rises through the ranks. Rocky spends all his time with Tommy therefore alienating his wife and particularly his son Rocky Junior (played by his real life son Sage Stallone). This develops a side story of his son starting school and going through a rebellious stage against his father. Later Tommy becomes frustrated with Rocky for not getting him fast enough up through the ranks to become the new heavyweight champion of the world so Duke who on several occasions tries to persuade Rocky to fight snatches Tommy who does win the title but is goaded by the public and media for not acknowledging Rocky's contribution to his win. Eventually after this Rocky and his son make up but Tommy wants to prove to the media and public who goad him about his easy win of the title that he is a true champion by challenging Rocky to a fight. He goes to where Rocky lives and they have a brutal street fight.Rocky V is fantastic. Stallone gives his best performance to date. And for the first time you feel a real bond between him and his son. This makes it more authentic by the fact that father and son are in real life. There are some touching moments between them and it's sad to see his son rebelling but understandable because of his fathers rejection.

Talia Shire as Adrian is excellent in this as ever and has more screen time whilst Burgess Meredith as Rocky's recent deceased coach has a small cameo in a flashback which he is terrific in.

There is more of a story to this as the true bond of family between husband, wife and son is felt. Throughout the films we have seen Rocky and Adrian transform themselves into more outgoing people who love each other and who we have come to care about as we have been with them on that journey. The final fight is brutal but inspiring. The film gives out a great and encouraging message that even though Rocky may have lost his career. He never lost his family or his respect as when he defeats Tommy Gunn, people chant his name. And that's what truly matters. Rocky V has heart and it's sad that Rocky Balboa (2006) is the last one, which I have yet to see and know it will a fitting end to a great boxing legend and cinema character icon.

It also features Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy, Dominique Minot, Ned Glass, and Jacques Marin. It's shot on location in Paris with Charles Lang on cinematography and Henry Mancini provides the score; where his memorable theme tune was Oscar nominated. When her husband is murdered, just prior to seeking a divorce from him, Regina Lampert (Hepburn) finds herself pursued by a number of men who seem to think she knows the location of a quarter of a million dollars in stolen loot. Of all the men who are now thrust into her life, it's the handsome Peter Joshua (Grant) who she trusts and sides with. Trouble is is that his name keeps changing and she's finding it difficult to determine who exactly are the good guys and who are the bad guys; especially as the corpses start to mount up.Pure Hollywood entertainment featuring two of its most endearing and classy performers, Charade shows how a multi genre spliced film should be made. It's rare to find a film that works on all levels, as a comedy, a thriller and a romance. But thanks to the astute direction from Donen, Charade comes up trumps whilst also oozing an elegant sheen about it. That Grant & Hepburn have charisma in abundance is something of a given, but they are given a quality script to work from and a Hitchcockian plot to revel in. It has been said from some critical quarters that there is no peril in Charade, thus its reputation is not entirely lived up to. Yes we can say it's a playful movie, but it's meant to be, pretty much like North By Northwest is. Yet the peril exists, lest we forget a great rooftop fight and the last quarter of the movie as we follow our hurried protagonists thru the Parisian underground; and on to a memorable encounter at a theatre. Or what about a metal handed George Kennedy putting the pressure on, or James Coburn menacingly playing with matches? No peril my eye! There's also been the odd dissenting voice proclaiming the structure of the story to be confused. Well it's very twisty, delightfully so, but nothing to tax the brain. Everything is laid out in simple terms and all dialogue is spoken nice and crisply. All played out amongst the splendid back drop of Paris. This was the first and only time that Hepburn & Grant appeared together. A crying shame, for in spite of Grant worrying about the age gap before hand (Grant 59\/Hepburn 34), to the extent he requested some dialogue changes to make Regina the romantic pursuer, their chemistry sparkles and they make a very believable coupling. Coburn, Kennedy & Glass are effective bad boys, while Matthau is a key presence throughout. Stylish, charming, suave and suspenseful, with an ending that's truly a pleasant surprise; both in revelation and character closure.

This is the first Holmes film shot in color, and it has a lot to offer. First of all, Peter Cushing is a remarkably good Holmes and quite faithful to the Conan Doyle conception of the character. He was a huge fan of the original stories and knew them quite well; it certainly translates onto the screen. Equally important, Andre Morrell does a superb turn as Dr. Watson, probably the most faithful and accurate portrayal of the doctor up to this point. The supporting cast is peopled with various Hammer stalwarts, foremost among them none other than Christopher Lee as Sir Henry. There are a few changes made to fit the novel into the Hammer style of horror a bit more closely (Sir Henry is menaced by a tarantula!), but they don't detract from the overall effectiveness. The Hound looks suitably menacing, fitted with a demonic dog mask to increase the spookiness, Cushing has a fun scene flinging a dagger into a table top while interrogating a suspect, and, to their undying credit, the filmmakers mount a ripping re-enactment of the events that began the legend. In most productions of the THOTB, this is omitted entirely or scanted. Not so here, and David Oxley is a most unnerving Sir Hugo. You can see why the neighbors thought he was possessed. Recommended.

Equally important, Andre Morrell does a superb turn as Dr. Watson, probably the most faithful and accurate portrayal of the doctor up to this point. The supporting cast is peopled with various Hammer stalwarts, foremost among them none other than Christopher Lee as Sir Henry. There are a few changes made to fit the novel into the Hammer style of horror a bit more closely (Sir Henry is menaced by a tarantula!), but they don't detract from the overall effectiveness. The Hound looks suitably menacing, fitted with a demonic dog mask to increase the spookiness, Cushing has a fun scene flinging a dagger into a table top while interrogating a suspect, and, to their undying credit, the filmmakers mount a ripping re-enactment of the events that began the legend. In most productions of the THOTB, this is omitted entirely or scanted. Not so here, and David Oxley is a most unnerving Sir Hugo. You can see why the neighbors thought he was possessed. Recommended.
