Not dull mind you because of the performances, and the dialogue is still razor sharp-- but because all La Cava does is keep the camera in a stationary position in front of the counter as they talk and get ready to take breakfast upstairs. There is nothing visually interesting happening in that scene.

But The Black Hole tries to do two things at once be a smart-contemplative science fiction story in the mold of Forbidden Planet where a team goes to investigate something, finds a ship and its Captain that has been gone for so long, and finds the wonder and madness that lies therein. The other thing? Wacky robots for kids voiced by Roddy McDowell and Slim Pickens! Ho-ho.I wish I could go on about how smart or insightful the movie is about the nature of man's exploration into space, but it would not be so. It pays lip-service to the weird wonder that is a black hole - a thing that should defy description that can pull anything inside of it and have it trapped in a perpetual existence for a thousand (or thousands) of years, or more. Its mystery could make for a really intriguing book, or perhaps a movie by someone with the right eye. The eye and minds behind The Black Hole are less interested in how it works than what kinds of cool stuff can happen with it when a mad space-Captain who has his own group of scientist-zombie people working for him on the double.As happens in these sort of stories, the ship that discovers them, which includes Anthony Perkins, Robert Forster, some actress named Yvette Mimieux, Ernest Borgnine, and the asshole-ish robot voiced by McDowell, wants to help them out. Then they see how mad\/genius they are, and they get split as to what to do. Without spoiling too much, things don't go quite as planned, and things turn to chaos... that is, the kind I wish I could give a damn about. Perhaps it's the passage of time of 30+ years, or that the story itself just isn't as interesting as its predecessors, but it's a dull movie. Even for kids the best that they can hope for with it is some bizarre robot-encounter scenes and McDowell's VINCENT so bitchy and snide you'd swear C-3PO and Marvin from Hitchhiker's Guide were meant to be one-upped.One of things I mean by the 'passage of time' isn't just the story, though that too is kind of brainless until the last ten minutes when it becomes a visual clusterf**k. It's the special effects. Some of the early space stuff looks decently laid out and modeled, but some of it hasn't aged well at all. It looks creaky and dark and the opening title sequence actually dominates as the highpoint visually for the film. The work as a whole isn't a total loss - it's fun seeing actors like Borgnine and Perkins and Maximillian Schell chew a little scenery (Forster, the professional he is, is the more relatable, boring protagonist here, but not his fault - plus the music by John Barry makes for spectacular listening at the least, and is comparable to the other great sci-fi movie soundtracks of its period).But it's a combination the dull plot, the uninteresting treatment or brushing past of the science of the black hole, the asinine treatment of the zombies, and that finale where all I can remember is the color RED and a lot of crazy happenings without any cohesion, that make it a forgettable experience. If it had focused on one or the other - a wacky-campy sci-fi trip for kids or a serious look at a black hole in the guise of a thriller, it might have had something. Only one death scene by a particular actor stands out as truly memorable, maybe worth checking out on Youtube. If I wasn't writing about it now, I'd probably lose sight of it within the next week.

While this film tanked when it was released back in 1949, I do hope that more people will give this movie another look because it's got the Disney stamp on it.First, we have Wind in the Willows, a truly delightful adaption of Kenneth Grahame's story and narrated by Basil Rathbone, keeps the British tone of the book very well while still being a lot of fun to watch. The character of J. Thaddeus Toad is really enjoyable to watch because of his fixation on anything that's new and the ways he'll try to get it. Mole, McBadger, and Rat are also a lot of fun, but my favorite character is the horse, Cyril Proudbottom. The courtroom scene just cracks me up because of the line Cyril says to the judge. The voice acting is really too, with Eric Blore and Pat O'Malley doing a particularly wonderful job.Next, we have The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, a much more darker story, but still a great one to watch. The great Bing Crosby's narration and top-notch animation tell a story of great humor and gripping horror. The nitpicking schoolmaster, Ichabod Crane, is a piece of animation genius along with some nice layouts and backgrounds to match. Most of the humor in the movie comes from the rivalry between Ichabod and the local town bully, Brom Bones. However, the scene leading up to the appearance of the Headless Horseman are certainly chilling and frightening and the horseman himself is just plan awesome and you get one great chase out of it. Something I never realized about this is that Ichabod is kind of a jerk. All he really cares about is marrying Katrina for her money and fantasizes about her dad being out of the picture and one could argue that Brom Bones is the hero of this film. The songs are also really great with The Headless Horseman and The Merry Song being the best ones in the film.I really love this movie and consider it one of the most underrated Disney animated films ever, right up there with Oliver & Company. For those who haven't seen this film, go see it and if you have kids, show them this; just cover their eyes when the Headless Horseman appears.Just remember, folks, don't try to reason with a guy with no head.

Even Data looks older and that of course should be impossible, although Brent Spiner seems to have filled out a little less than Geordi or Riker. The story-line leaves little for the two main female cast members, Troi and Dr Crusher, to do plus just where was wunderkind Wesley.I sort of get the allusions to contemporary events in the world at around this time over the Serbia \/ Bosnia conflict in the old Yugoslavia and of course laudable that Picard jettisons the Starfleet Prime Directive of non-interference to save the native species, but even then his noble action appears to be as much about wooing an attractive female he encounters on the planet surface as being a big humanitarian.As a film too it moves too slowly and unexcitingly. There are attempts at humour, as ever, involving Data, but these fall flat especially when he joins his captain in bellowing out an old Gilbert and Sullivan tune for some desperately important reason I can't even remember just now while director Frakes gets the awkward job of filming himself and Troi getting frisky with each other. This is nothing however compared to the cringe-worthy scene when Picard briefly attempts to dance the samba in a bid to recapture his youth.There was also no big race-against-time cliffhanging finish which I felt the film needed, indeed, as said earlier, I found the pacing, dialogue and editing to be poor throughout.

There's seem to be little or no attempt to broaden the movie's appeal outside dedicated fans without a big name actor to square off against Picard and co (all we get are a heavily made-up F Murray Abraham and rent-a-face Antjony Zerbe) and a story that looks and feels like a two-parter from the TV series presented on the big screen and a not very good two-parter at that.It doesn't help that you can see old father time catching up on our favourite crew members apart from the Captain, who of course never looked young in the first place. Even Data looks older and that of course should be impossible, although Brent Spiner seems to have filled out a little less than Geordi or Riker. The story-line leaves little for the two main female cast members, Troi and Dr Crusher, to do plus just where was wunderkind Wesley.I sort of get the allusions to contemporary events in the world at around this time over the Serbia \/ Bosnia conflict in the old Yugoslavia and of course laudable that Picard jettisons the Starfleet Prime Directive of non-interference to save the native species, but even then his noble action appears to be as much about wooing an attractive female he encounters on the planet surface as being a big humanitarian.As a film too it moves too slowly and unexcitingly.

The film, based on the stage play of the same name follows a fictional rivalry between Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. F. Murray Abraham plays Salieri, the now largely forgotten composer who was rich and famous in his day. Tom Hulce plays Mozart, a composer whose pieces are now recognized for the genius that they, but he struggled to make ends meet. Unlike the rest of the world, Salieri recognized Mozart for the genius that he was... and it drove him mad. Despite his love for the man's work, we witness Salieri spend his life doing everything in his power to sabotage Mozart, with the young author believing them to be friends.The film is an astounding period piece, using a mix of authentic locations and perfect re-creations to bring you back to the late 18th century. I found the costumes to be absolutely convincing, from the elaborate ballroom gowns to the crazy opera costumes. This film is set when people wore elaborate powdered wigs and went to masquerades so bizarre, it makes your average Halloween party look a waste of time. If you have any interest in clothing or costumes, and not even on a professional level, this film will blow your mind. If you have some lady friends that don't usually go for movies that you like, lure them in with promises of fantastic wardrobes and costumes. As you might expect, the music is fantastic, but it's not as simple as some of the most memorable parts of Mozart's music playing over characters walking around, or a bit of quiet music playing in the background while characters talk. Sequences where the climax in the orchestra matches the actions of the characters, or a scene taken from one of Mozart's operas and used to indicate exactly what kind of turmoil is going on inside our characters' hearts is what you look forward to seeing in this film. Equally astounding are the performances. Everyone here is absolutely convincing in their role, particularly F. Murray Abraham as a truly tortured soul. Even Tom Hulce, who is slightly annoying as the cackling, buffoonish Mozart is absolutely perfect. You instantly feel the rage and the simultaneous despair that grows inside of Salieri seeing this young guy flaunting his talent while seemingly not taking any of his music seriously.As I mentioned, the standout role is F. Murray Abraham as Salieri. Talk about a complex character. On the one hand, you feel really bad for this guy. He has spent his entire life dedicated to music. No women, no partying, no fun whatsoever because he promised to God that he would give himself to his music (and to him) if he was gifted with the talent to create beautiful symphonies. That might sound extreme written down like this, but in the context of the film, you believe it. You always hear about artists going mad and being either eccentric or unbearable to work with because of their burning passion and this is a prime example. It's not that this guy is unpleasant; it's that he is so passionate about his music that everything else is an obstacle to him. All he cares about is his music. Then, enter Mozart and the tragedy of it all. Mozart is young, handsome, he doesn't seem to take anything seriously and he effortlessly composes. You know exactly what Salieri feels like, because everyone's been there. The difference is that our main character is a tragic one and decides to do the unthinkable, something even he feels disgusted at by choosing to become Mozart's enemy instead of his friend. That's the fascinating element of this film; Salieri is successful, but realizes that in time, his music will fade away, while Mozart, who has the makings of the greatest musician of all time, is still struggling. These two men could have become friends, maybe even collaborated and become immortals. It breaks your heart to see it play out, and you cannot look away for a second.Amadeus is what you wish every movie was like. It's a long movie, sure, but every instant is absolutely gripping. It's tragic, it's comic, it's breathtaking. It's fiction so good you wish it was reality. Every time I think about the story, it simultaneously breaks my heart and it fills me with joy. Dedicate yourself an afternoon to Amadeus and watch it without any distractions. It's an experience you will never forget, one that will profoundly affect you.

One of the great films from the great 1994 year of movies, this takes a rather big step towards addressing the possibilities of the meaning of life, faith, belief, heart, friendship, family, love, fun, & entertaining unbearably goofy comedy! And I'm glad to this day it has!I'm a guy from Japan, born the 90s, and this is one of my top favorite Disney movies! Always has been & will continue to be!! This is just one of those MANY sports film that were plain *awesome* from the 90s! (Though I personally wouldn't count Mighty Ducks - I never was really a fan of hockey - I sort of think it's an overrated sport.) I'm actually going by the lines of Cool Runnings, The Big Green, Rookie of the Year, etc. I even hear this movie actually had the BIGGEST film premiere in 1994, with the movie grossing more than DOUBLE than what they started with in their budget!! Isn't that saying something? ;)I'm sure in many ways that not only people who play baseball, or believe in God can relate to this film; I even believe children who are ORPHANS can relate to it, too - I'm sure they want films they can relate to as well! And there may also be people who just KNOW there must be a bigger & deeper meaning to life than just getting glory, making money, & dying.Before I forget to mention, man oh man, is Randy Edelman's music so uplifting! I think the man deserves an Oscar nomination for at least SOMETHING! (I mean, this is the same guy who did the Beethoven movies, a Tall Tale, The Big Green & Dragonheart!) I thin almost 50% of this film owes it's thanks to his GENIUS score! The guy is surely underrated - he deserves more attention from Hollywood than he's getting.I give credit to this movie for INTRODUCING me not only to the sport of baseball, but also the California Angels, big Hollywood names as Danny Glover (with always the loyal & friendly character to support the main characters throughout whatever story there may be), Joseph-Gordon Levitt (LOVE how he's always kept that same innocent boyish face, lol), Christopher Lloyd, Adrien Brody, Matthew Mcconaughey (BOTH Oscar winners today!), and Tony Danza. I mean I didn't know it was them at the time - but now of course I do, with such modern-day access to information on the Net these days. I guess they were just really good at playing their characters!(But if I had to say if there was downside to this movie, I would have to say that people don't become angels when they die, as the film suggests - in fact, angels are just meant to be ministering spirits for us ~ Hebrews 114. Either Heaven or Hell or our destination after we die.) And I might wanna add, the way the ANGELS are depicted themselves in this film is indeed impressive! The effects surely do hold to this day! I mean, they are just GORGEOUS to look at! When I was a very young, I really thought that's how they looked. But hey actually, they're actually more amazing than THAT! Yes, I am sure serious. But that's another long story...Again, I'm fan of and I still love Joseph Gordon-Levitt; he is RENOWNED for being in this film in my memory! But I''ll be honest when I say I hate or seriously DISLIKE a lot of the recent films he's been in (ie. Looper, Inception, Don Jon, etc.) As if he almost WANTS to ruin our childhoods of him. I can't believe he would go to great lengths and such deep measures by including himself in this great, wholesome, family movie that encourages good behavior, loving relationships, stronger faith in Heaven, God, angels, etc., but then gets into OTHER films that are not only just all-round atrocious, awful, disgusting, filthy, and encourage BAD behavior, but even misuse & take the Lord's name in vain! Unfortunately, that happens all the time, and I'm sick of it! Rarely are there ever films these days, except for Facing the Giants that really praise and upholds the name of Lord. But I guess as always, The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. (Prov. 17) Ugh, with Don Jon........... &@!$#% that movie!!!But on the bright side, I even find that quote that Maggie says near the third part of the film about a football player kneels to thank God after a great game, I immediately knew it seemed to foreshadowing Tim Tebow, a great sports player of today!And I find it just RUDE & BIGOTED for thee Nostalgia Critic to come across this movie, and think it silly & simplistic that boy ask God for a family & helps a baseball game win, when there's starving children in Africa or war in the Middle-East. CUT IT SOME SLACK, Critic! God could clearly say the same thing about US (we) people! Have you forgotten that God is all places at all times??? God CAN send His angels for supernatural interventions; God tries even WORKING THROUGH people to feed starving people or bring peace to the Middle-East - it's just that most of us are too far caught up in our everyday lives or self-indulgence we just don't notice it, nor is it reported by the mainstream media.But DITTO to that last quote by AL the Angel - We're always watching! DITTO, to that, man! Ditto and amen!With this film whether like Beauty & the Beast and The Lion King, as I get older & older, it only gets better & better!

One of the great films from the great 1994 year of movies, this takes a rather big step towards addressing the possibilities of the meaning of life, faith, belief, heart, friendship, family, love, fun, & entertaining unbearably goofy comedy! And I'm glad to this day it has!I'm a guy from Japan, born the 90s, and this is one of my top favorite Disney movies! Always has been & will continue to be!! This is just one of those MANY sports film that were plain *awesome* from the 90s! (Though I personally wouldn't count Mighty Ducks - I never was really a fan of hockey - I sort of think it's an overrated sport.) I'm actually going by the lines of Cool Runnings, The Big Green, Rookie of the Year, etc. I even hear this movie actually had the BIGGEST film premiere in 1994, with the movie grossing more than DOUBLE than what they started with in their budget!! Isn't that saying something? ;)I'm sure in many ways that not only people who play baseball, or believe in God can relate to this film; I even believe children who are ORPHANS can relate to it, too - I'm sure they want films they can relate to as well! And there may also be people who just KNOW there must be a bigger & deeper meaning to life than just getting glory, making money, & dying.Before I forget to mention, man oh man, is Randy Edelman's music so uplifting! I think the man deserves an Oscar nomination for at least SOMETHING! (I mean, this is the same guy who did the Beethoven movies, a Tall Tale, The Big Green & Dragonheart!) I thin almost 50% of this film owes it's thanks to his GENIUS score! The guy is surely underrated - he deserves more attention from Hollywood than he's getting.I give credit to this movie for INTRODUCING me not only to the sport of baseball, but also the California Angels, big Hollywood names as Danny Glover (with always the loyal & friendly character to support the main characters throughout whatever story there may be), Joseph-Gordon Levitt (LOVE how he's always kept that same innocent boyish face, lol), Christopher Lloyd, Adrien Brody, Matthew Mcconaughey (BOTH Oscar winners today!), and Tony Danza. I mean I didn't know it was them at the time - but now of course I do, with such modern-day access to information on the Net these days. I guess they were just really good at playing their characters!(But if I had to say if there was downside to this movie, I would have to say that people don't become angels when they die, as the film suggests - in fact, angels are just meant to be ministering spirits for us ~ Hebrews 114. Either Heaven or Hell or our destination after we die.) And I might wanna add, the way the ANGELS are depicted themselves in this film is indeed impressive! The effects surely do hold to this day! I mean, they are just GORGEOUS to look at! When I was a very young, I really thought that's how they looked. But hey actually, they're actually more amazing than THAT! Yes, I am sure serious. But that's another long story...Again, I'm fan of and I still love Joseph Gordon-Levitt; he is RENOWNED for being in this film in my memory! But I''ll be honest when I say I hate or seriously DISLIKE a lot of the recent films he's been in (ie. Looper, Inception, Don Jon, etc.) As if he almost WANTS to ruin our childhoods of him. I can't believe he would go to great lengths and such deep measures by including himself in this great, wholesome, family movie that encourages good behavior, loving relationships, stronger faith in Heaven, God, angels, etc., but then gets into OTHER films that are not only just all-round atrocious, awful, disgusting, filthy, and encourage BAD behavior, but even misuse & take the Lord's name in vain! Unfortunately, that happens all the time, and I'm sick of it! Rarely are there ever films these days, except for Facing the Giants that really praise and upholds the name of Lord.

She is traumatized and goes out to seek revenge. Meanwhile Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is suspended for the normal reasons. Brutality, excessive force, the usual. Well Harry just happened to give an old crime lord a heart attack before he was suspended so now all the henchmen are coming after him. Of course he beats all of them but because the bosses have seemed to realize that Harry just can't go anywhere right now without ending up destroying something they put him on a case to that small town where Jennifer is killing off all her enemies. And if you thought that Harry got into fights in San Francisco, he did, but here every time he tries to say anything the locals get defensive. And because Harry can't do anything without making a smart remark he gets into fights with just about anyone. Sudden Impact I feel doesn't have the same qualities that were in the first 3 movies. It doesn't have a whole lot of action scenes after he leaves San Francisco. Another big problem with it is that it's just dark. I know the other films had dark bits (especially Dirty Harry) but they were still fun to watch. This just comes off as unpleasant. It's not a god-awful film and the acting here is pretty good, but I do believe that all the things about this movie being worse then the last 3 were probably right.

It's hard to pass this off as a serious and scary movie, where it leads more towards humor, yet it's still an engrossing tale of a troubled writer, who's Grandma (who we've seen in bit parts in many other films) suicides. He moves into his Grandma's two story place, to start on a new novel about yeah.... his experiences in Vietnam. Some funny flashbacks, here I tell ya, more like done in a studio. William Katt as the novelist is ideal, who thinks he's going crazy? Is it him, or this house possessed? That's the fun of the entire movie, where we have a few bit performances from actors I like, like Alan Autry and Steven Williams as cops. George Wendt as Katt's prying neighbor was fun too.

However, this is no ordinary villain. It's Freddy Krueger, who attacks them in their sleep. And as we all have to sleep sometimes, this is a very frightening idea. Sadly, the actual film fails to do it justice. Hailed as a terrifying horror classic, A Nightmare On Elm Street is anything but. It's not without its highlights. Robert Englund is a treat as Krueger and turns him into one of the more menacing horror movie monsters. The make up artist deserves praise as Kruger's appearance is horrifying and adds to the limited fear of the movie. The acting is good in a horror film for once (Look out for a pre fame Johnny Depp getting gruesomely dispatched in the film's most memorable death scene) and Wes Craven shows there is plenty of reason to call him the master of horror. His direction is overall pretty good and there are 3 genuinely startling moments (The fourth was spoiled by the trailer).The script is pretty lame and the dialogue is very boring. The dream sequences soon become repetitive and the film doesn't go as far as it could have done. It feels like it doesn't meet it's full potential. It's very irritating and totally ridiculous as the way the protagonist defeats Krueger is pretty lame. As usual, the killer inexplicably reappears and sets up a sequel. The main problem with ANOES is that it's not scary. It has some tense moments but it's not interested in tension or creepiness. What it is interested in is loads of fake blood, undeniably impressive special effects and nightmares. At times it feels like some laughably awful Halloween joke shop advert for fake blood and Halloween masks. It's not scary; it's just showing off how good its gore effects are and this is very off putting. Also, this is nasty, preposterous slasher fare with no real purpose. Cowering in the shadow of Halloween, Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Scream and even Child's Play, this is definitely not one of the horror genre's finer offerings.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 November 2014","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This 80s slasher flick follows a group of teenagers who are, as usual in slasher films, facing a terrifying killer.

It makes you ache with envy.When he is called back to the office, he is given no gadgets, only a Walther PPK to replace his Beretta, which the man from Q-branch refers to as suitable for a lady's handbag. It makes you realize what the series could have been if only each successive film had not been compelled to try to dazzle the audience with gadgetry.The movie is more realistic than future Bond movies, especially in the way that on a couple of occasions he is careful to keep the enemy from getting a photograph of him. By the second film, From Russia with Love, his face is well-known to the enemy, which in real life would have meant a desk job from then on.

The result is a fascinating epic with fantastic production values, some gruesome violence and a whole load of explicit sex.Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (or Caligula for short), as you may be aware, was the tyrannical ruler of Rome from 37AD to 41AD. During his short reign of power, he ensured his place in history with his many acts of depravity, cruelty and sheer madness. Malcolm McDowell is totally believable as the loony leader who shags his sister, makes his horse a member of the senate and forces his senators' wives and daughters into prostitution. Other big names that signed up for this highly controversial movie include (Dame) Helen Mirren, (Sir) John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole.Watching these highly regarded thesps mixing with Penthouse pets performing hardcore lesbian trysts and blow-jobs is a real eye-opener and really has to be seen to be believed.

It's a hard one to rate, but I think I'll give it a reasonable 7 out of 10 just for its willingness to go the extra mile to entertain.

The film might be a bit hard going at times, but fans of extremely bizarre and trashy movies should definitely see this one if they can.Caligula is by no means a great film (it is overlong, factually inaccurate and at times I was tempted to fast forward through the slower bits to get to the next 'shocking' scene), but it is one of those movies that one needs to witness first hand in order to understand how truly unique and unusual it is. It's a hard one to rate, but I think I'll give it a reasonable 7 out of 10 just for its willingness to go the extra mile to entertain. ","genre":"Drama, History"},{"date":"26 November 2014","score":"","review":" Charting the titular Roman emperor's rise to power and his descent into madness, Caligula (the unrated version) is a curious beast. A top-class cast star in this lavish big-budget spectacular, written by renowned scribe Gore Vidal, but produced by Bob Guccione, publisher of Penthouse magazine, and directed by erotic movie maker Tinto Brass. The result is a fascinating epic with fantastic production values, some gruesome violence and a whole load of explicit sex.Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (or Caligula for short), as you may be aware, was the tyrannical ruler of Rome from 37AD to 41AD. During his short reign of power, he ensured his place in history with his many acts of depravity, cruelty and sheer madness. Malcolm McDowell is totally believable as the loony leader who shags his sister, makes his horse a member of the senate and forces his senators' wives and daughters into prostitution. Other big names that signed up for this highly controversial movie include (Dame) Helen Mirren, (Sir) John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole.Watching these highly regarded thesps mixing with Penthouse pets performing hardcore lesbian trysts and blow-jobs is a real eye-opener and really has to be seen to be believed. The film, at a running time of two and a half hours, is quite slow going but it's worth persevering!

He is stiff and proper. Father Matthew Thomas (Tom Wilkinson) is a flamboyant leftist man of the people. Pilkington is uncertain of the senior Father and disapproves of the housekeeper Maria Kerrigan (Cathy Tyson) as well as their relationship. Greg hears Lisa Unsworth's confession about her incestuous father which causes him a moral conflict. He is also struggling with his own homosexual feelings towards Graham (Robert Carlyle).This movie has a lot of things going on and it's trying to make a point about sex and the church. I like all the actors in this and they do an admirable job. The point could have been made better with a slim down script. Tom Wilkinson could have played a simple elder statesman. His character's sexual going-ons probably distracted the main story a bit. The incest story is quite compelling and brings out some real effecting scenes.

Look, Imma tell you, the masses love crap and this movie is a major piece of crap. And don't give me that crap cos I'm gay, I'm supposed to love Judy Garland cos I don't. Uh-uh. She had a funny face with the black eyes and the round nose. This movie for funny White people has such a dirty, disgusting feel, and I cannot stand one second of it! It's the movie I'm afraid to have a nightmare of being trapped inside this utterly idiotic universe with the dwarfs (is that the correct PC term these days?) who lick gigantic lollipops all the while screeching some nasally ear- splitting songs, the yellow brick road and ruby red shoes. Look the story is not dreadful per se, the color is, and it's those revolting looking actors in their costumes. And this movie has homophobic undertones, with the lion in love with the scarecrow but never able to purely express their love for one another due to audience homophobia. Anyone who subjects their kid to this anxiety-provoking and nightmarish uglies-riddled garbage needs to be jailed for child abuse. One of the most disturbing films I have ever seen, and, although I'm atheist, God knows I've seen quite a few. So many, I can count them on my fingers and toes, and in fact, still have like seven toes leftover. Not one of my best reviews, granted, but I wanted to convey that's how boring and uninspiring this film is. Even Toto the dog is annoying. Don't look behind the curtain now, but I think he's a little yapper of sorts.
