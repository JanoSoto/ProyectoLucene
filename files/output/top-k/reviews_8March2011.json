Also, this is the film watched by the McCallisters in the first two 'Home Alone' movies, only dubbed in different languages (French and Spanish).This is considered a Christmas film. I don't totally agree. Yes, it takes place on Christmas and you see a lot of Christmas decorations, Christmas lights, snow and such, but it doesn't feel that Christmassy. In my opinion a Christmas tale is supposed to bring joy and a feel good feeling. Instead, this is a bitter film with a lot of unpleasant scenes. Besides, with a title like that, I'd expect a light-hearted, feel-good movie in the line of 'Mary Poppins', for example.The beginning is excellent and frankly couldn't have been better with visually delicious details such as the opening credits resembling Christmas postcards, the town with its Christmas decorations and lights and snow, the stars's speech, a group of kids sliding on the ice of a frozen pond where little George Bailey saves his brother's life and the pharmacy sequence except for the disturbing part when Mr. Gower beats up George causing his ear to bleed after George's heroic act. Bobby Anderson does a fine portrayal of little George Bailey.From the moment George Bailey grows up, the film slowly loses its initial greatness and excellency. James Stewart's acting is great but I think he overacts in this role. Adult George Bailey lacks the charm and sympathy of little George Bailey.Mr. Potter, while well portrayed by the actor, is not a likable character, being a corrupt, despicable and malicious man. To a point, George is so frustrated and desperate that he takes it all out on his family and on a teacher by insulting her at the phone and wants to kill himself, feeling he's more worth dead than alive and wishing he was never born at all. His savior, an angel named Clarence, makes his wish come true so that he sees and experiences what would the world be like without him. And that alternative reality is creepy in many ways.To finish my long review, it's truly a pity that the rest of the film doesn't match the brilliant beginning, otherwise it could have been one of the all time greats.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"8 March 2011","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" It's an effective and spooky psychological horror story, with Deborah Kerr as a governess, Miss Giddens, sent to an enormous, remote country house to care for two cute but strange children, Pamela Franklin as Flora and Martin Stephens as Miles. It gets stranger.The opening scene has Kerr being interviewed by the children's distant uncle, Michael Redgrave, who has no room in his life mentally or emotionally for the little tykes. Kerr is an unmarried daughter of a Minister and seems attracted to Redgrave but he sends her off with good wishes and leaves for Italy, not wanting to be bothered.The novel begins with someone telling someone else the story of someone else. Conrad's Heart of Darkness begins the same way. I don't know how this fad got started. It turned me off at first but the story itself is so involving that I did a paper on it in graduate school. It was the only novel by Henry James that I enjoyed.At the vast estate, Kerr meets the grounded and practical housekeeper, Mrs. Grose, and the two cute children. Miles has just been expelled from school for vague reasons but at first everything seems to be going along swimmingly. The kids are always polite and smiling, fond of playing games, sometimes just involving the two of them.But odd things begin to happen. I'll just give three examples. The grinning eleven-year-old Flora calls to Miss Giddens and says, Oh, look! A pretty butterfly. It's being eaten by a spider. And later, when Miss Giddens is clipping roses in the garden, she uncovers a shabby lawn ornament, a chipped cherub, and from its open mouth a cockroach tumbles out. Finally, the two children ask if Miss Gidden's home was a big as theirs, and was it big enough for secrets? The kids smile perkily as if there were a particular reason for asking that particular question.Mrs. Grose tell Miss Giddens that the children were very attached to a butler and the previous governess, now both dead. The butler and governess were a couple of rascals. He beat hell out of her but she loved it, and they christened every room with their sexual escapades, although the little kids must have stumbled on them once in a while. Giddens becomes firmly convinced that the kids have been possessed by the spirits of the departed miscreants.It's all very ambiguous. Either Giddens is off her rocker or there are ghosts haunting the place and living through the children, as she puts it. Although Giddens importunes them the kids admit nothing. Mrs. Grose has seen nothing supernatural or even unusual in the kids -- not until Miss Giddens started getting hysterical around them.When I read this, I took it as a ghost story. Yes, it's vague, and the spirits are clichés. (It's hard to avoid clichés in a ghost story taking place in a huge Victorian mansion.) Sobbing is heard, a wispy figure is glimpsed in the distance. But it's all told from Gidden's point of view, and I now see it as her personal problem. I mean, after all, how can the spirits be incarnated in the brother and sister. The brother never mistreats his sister, nor is he likely to be playing doctor with her. Miles does give Miss Giddens a great big smooch for a good-night kiss but that might just be childish clumsiness.Taken pragmatically, looking only at the consequences, Miss Giddens arrives, and then Flora goes nuts and Miles dies of shock in her arms while she screams at him. It's good to look at it pragmatically. The author's brother, William, would have been pleased.The role of Miss Giddens, the lonely and excitable spinster, could have been written for Deborah Kerr. She gives a fine performance. (She was miscast as the bruised and sluttish Army wife in From Here to Eternity although she was flawless as the tough middle-aged housewife in The Sundowners.) She looks as innocent as the children. It would be sinful to think of her ankles. The two kids are very good too. I don't know how they manage to find children of that age who can act so convincingly. They're both terribly cute too. Pamela Franklin grew up to be even cuter a few years later. In fact she was pretty yummy in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. Now, having seen it a dozen times, I'm impressed by the less noticeable elements of the movie -- the painterly composition of each shot, for instance, retained even when the camera is in motion. It seems to me that this is so much more frightening and better done in almost every respect than a typical slasher movie, even one with elements of originality like Night of the Living Dead.

Giddens becomes firmly convinced that the kids have been possessed by the spirits of the departed miscreants.It's all very ambiguous.

Yes, it's vague, and the spirits are clichés. (It's hard to avoid clichés in a ghost story taking place in a huge Victorian mansion.) Sobbing is heard, a wispy figure is glimpsed in the distance. But it's all told from Gidden's point of view, and I now see it as her personal problem. I mean, after all, how can the spirits be incarnated in the brother and sister. The brother never mistreats his sister, nor is he likely to be playing doctor with her. Miles does give Miss Giddens a great big smooch for a good-night kiss but that might just be childish clumsiness.Taken pragmatically, looking only at the consequences, Miss Giddens arrives, and then Flora goes nuts and Miles dies of shock in her arms while she screams at him. It's good to look at it pragmatically. The author's brother, William, would have been pleased.The role of Miss Giddens, the lonely and excitable spinster, could have been written for Deborah Kerr. She gives a fine performance. (She was miscast as the bruised and sluttish Army wife in From Here to Eternity although she was flawless as the tough middle-aged housewife in The Sundowners.) She looks as innocent as the children. It would be sinful to think of her ankles. The two kids are very good too. I don't know how they manage to find children of that age who can act so convincingly. They're both terribly cute too. Pamela Franklin grew up to be even cuter a few years later. In fact she was pretty yummy in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. Now, having seen it a dozen times, I'm impressed by the less noticeable elements of the movie -- the painterly composition of each shot, for instance, retained even when the camera is in motion. It seems to me that this is so much more frightening and better done in almost every respect than a typical slasher movie, even one with elements of originality like Night of the Living Dead. ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"8 March 2011","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" It's an effective and spooky psychological horror story, with Deborah Kerr as a governess, Miss Giddens, sent to an enormous, remote country house to care for two cute but strange children, Pamela Franklin as Flora and Martin Stephens as Miles. It gets stranger.The opening scene has Kerr being interviewed by the children's distant uncle, Michael Redgrave, who has no room in his life mentally or emotionally for the little tykes. Kerr is an unmarried daughter of a Minister and seems attracted to Redgrave but he sends her off with good wishes and leaves for Italy, not wanting to be bothered.The novel begins with someone telling someone else the story of someone else. Conrad's Heart of Darkness begins the same way. I don't know how this fad got started. It turned me off at first but the story itself is so involving that I did a paper on it in graduate school. It was the only novel by Henry James that I enjoyed.At the vast estate, Kerr meets the grounded and practical housekeeper, Mrs. Grose, and the two cute children. Miles has just been expelled from school for vague reasons but at first everything seems to be going along swimmingly. The kids are always polite and smiling, fond of playing games, sometimes just involving the two of them.But odd things begin to happen. I'll just give three examples. The grinning eleven-year-old Flora calls to Miss Giddens and says, Oh, look! A pretty butterfly. It's being eaten by a spider. And later, when Miss Giddens is clipping roses in the garden, she uncovers a shabby lawn ornament, a chipped cherub, and from its open mouth a cockroach tumbles out. Finally, the two children ask if Miss Gidden's home was a big as theirs, and was it big enough for secrets? The kids smile perkily as if there were a particular reason for asking that particular question.Mrs. Grose tell Miss Giddens that the children were very attached to a butler and the previous governess, now both dead. The butler and governess were a couple of rascals. He beat hell out of her but she loved it, and they christened every room with their sexual escapades, although the little kids must have stumbled on them once in a while. Giddens becomes firmly convinced that the kids have been possessed by the spirits of the departed miscreants.It's all very ambiguous.

Tim Robbins once again shows why any movie he's in is worth watching. (Well, maybe not The Hudsucker Proxy, but that's not his fault!!) And Meg Ryan simply glows. She has never looked or acted better. As with any good movie, the supporting cast also shines. There's some familiar faces like Lou Jacobi and some different faces.It is also a very nice looking movie. Maybe the Director coming from Australia is a factor as sometimes it takes an outsider to see the beauty of New Jersey!! And that Princeton part of Joisey is certainly beautiful.You'll enjoy yourself with this movie.

The supporting character acting was immature and poor by comparison.Hopkins delivered all the best lines with captivating presence as always.The story is inspiring. An exploration of the best and the worst of human characteristics portrayed by two men stranded in the wilderness. One a survivor the other a coward. Baldwin is the coward, jealous, greedy, deceitful and shamed. Whereas Hopkins' character demonstrates all the best characteristics for survival courage, perseverance, motivation, tenacity, resourcefulness, optimism, generosity, forgiveness and dignity.The story line is quite good but could have been better developed. The supporting character acting could have been more credible. The characters are pretty superficial, except of course Hopkins' who is portrayed at the start of the film as a bookish, repressed, rich eccentric who goes on to reveal himself as a man of great character in adversity.Overall I would say that it was worth seeing just to watch Hopkins' mesmerising performance.

The script by Tom Stoppard is strong. It's very good film, but some irritating flaws keep it from being great. With the exception of Kate Winslet, a lot of the acting is over the top. Also, the film wimps out on the true story, and misses some fascinating complexity, since in real life the lead character was gay, at a time where that alone was enough to win everyone's distrust. Further, the whole style of the film feels old-fashioned in a way that goes back and forth between charming and forced. Last, at least the US version is a really bad DVD transfer. Lots of soft spots, etc. And yet, I'd still urge people to see it.
