[{"date":"20 May 2014","score":"","review":" Every high school has its issues. Whether it is misbehaved youth, poor budgeting management, inadequate staff or out of date supplies, there's always something that needs work. Interestingly enough, most students would likely say that it's their teachers that make their time feel like a waste. Sometimes this is true, while other times teachers are used as scapegoats for another person's problems. But what if the teachers were the problem and their intent was much more serious than one would expect? This is what happens when a random cluster of students at an ordinary high school discover that their teachers aren't what they appear to be.Directing this movie is Robert Rodriguez who has a story in the genre of horror for the second time - before that was From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). Accompanying Rodriguez is writer Kevin Williamson who also wrote for Scream (1996) and the rest of its later sequels. The strange thing is, much of the material Williamson uses is blatantly taken from other movies. Yet he does it in a way that at least credits them and somewhat morphs it into his own without coming off as complete copy. For example, there are some conversations that discuss the previous Invasion of the Body Snatcher films. The leads even come up with a test to determine who is real and who isn't, just like John Carpenter's The Thing (1982). Again, it's not new, but it at least aims to entertain with a slightly different angle.The cast contains various new and old actors. Some of which the new actors would become highly regarded in the current day. Playing some of the faculty, you have Robert Patrick, Salma Hayek, Famke Janssen and even Jon Stewart. The young actors include Jordana Brewster as the uptight prissy girl, Clea DuVall as antisocial introvert, Laura Harris as the newcomer to the school, Josh Hartnett as the stayback senior, Shawn Hatosy as the Jock, Usher as his best jock friend and Elijah Wood as the bookworm. All of them portray their characters accurately considering they all look like highschoolers. Perhaps the most interesting character is Shawn Hatosy for playing a jock that decides that grades are more important than sports. That's rare for an athlete. Other than that, these characters are fun to watch but none of them stand out enough to be truly memorable.The creature itself in this movie isn't memorable either. However, in spite of that, its presence is still not to be missed. To explain it, it basically is like trying to explain what John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) looked like; you can't. It's a thing. Considering this movie partially exists in the horror genre the gore is respectable. Some of the gore moments are a little unpredictable but most are cliché because of them being taken from other films. For the most part, the CGI is convincing enough to get by even though there are some moments where it looks dated too. Helping to enhance the experience of horror is composer Marco Beltrami's score and unfortunately, it's not his best work. His music can be heard when it comes to the scares, but he missed a lot of emotional cues that could've been used. Oh well, it's still fun though.Its concept is not new but it has moments that make it different from past films with a decent cast and special effects. Its music could've been a little better though.

They form a club named Dead Poets Society, and have poetry reading, and share free thoughts about their own view to the world, and try several things they are not allowed to even think about by school in a cave. They go through lots of changes in their perspective on their lives, but somehow, cruel reality of real society turns them down. However in the end they learn valuable lessons that they might never forget through their lives by Standing Up on their own feet. Through the movie, John Keating is always there to help the boys, and to instruct them to get to the real truth of life, Carpe diem.Even though this movie is set in 1950s, I could easily empathize with the characters. Several settings in the movie such as their rigid instructor like Dr.Hager, suffocating father, Mr. Perry, or Orthodox education method that Dr.Hager insists, and mandatory school uniforms which kill the characteristics of each member of the students reminded me so much of my school life which was from 2005 to 2007. Because in Korea, still, fever of education for their kids among parents are irrationally rampant, I actually was kind of like the students in the movie who were forced by adults to obey the rules, never being allowed to think by themselves. Watching the movie, I felt the exact catharsis that those enthusiastic and ambitious boys felt with John's unorthodox way of teaching. Overall, the movie was so good that Iwould say it is one of my top best 10 movies from 20th century. The plot was very believable, and convincing, and the performances of the young actors were outstanding. I cried when they cried, and I shouted Oh, captain, my captain! when they shouted out loud Oh, captain, my captain! At the end, poignant scenes involving tears of sincere and poor boys left in the cruel society made me think a lot about whose fault can we say it is on the tragedies. Could we blame the period of the time, 1950s, or generation, or just adults? I think it's blindness whether it is deliberate, or naturally passed that we have to think about. I think this question made it such a good movie. And because of so many parents in Korea these days still blindly pursuing only good results of school grades of their children, I think a movie like this should be seen more to be aware of what value we should put our priorities on &#x96; especially when it's about our society's future inner circle-to-be.

'Candyman' didn't really cry out for sequels, and this movie proves that point by being completely redundant and failing to come up with anything more interesting than a less satisfying but bloodier spin on what's gone before. It's well made, it's watchable enough, and it benefits from a likable performance from Timothy Carhart, but it's a typical horror sequel.It's Mardi Gras season in New Orleans, where inner-city school teacher Annie Tarrant (Kelly Rowan) proves to her class that there is no Candyman by looking into a mirror and saying his name five times. As we know, the Candyman is real - and her brother Ethan (William O'Leary) knows it too, as he's been wrongly accused of the murder of the smug fat bloke from the first film. The real culprit is the hook-handed killer (Tony Todd), back to wreak more havoc in the lives of Annie's family while she delves into the legend to discover the truth. 'Farewell to the Flesh' departs from the original with Annie's deep, dark family secret, which is not only predictable but also totally uninteresting. Other than that it uses the first movie as a template, repeating the black urban setting, the missing kid, an innocent accused of the Candyman's crimes, and the Candyman's spell over Annie. The attempted twists come after far too much draggy set-up where the movie attempts to create mystery about the existence of the Candyman despite this being a sequel to a film where that mystery was resolved. The menace of the character has disappeared; his appearances are too numerous and lacking in impact, and the moments when he pops up to stick his hook through someone's back lack surprise. In the film's biggest mistake we're shown the origin of the Candyman in graphic detail. In the first movie we got a few sound effects and a sinister story, and that was enough. Here we see his hand getting hacked off with a rusty saw and a swarm of bees covering his body before he dies from the stings. The ropey staging and unconvincing period costumes add to the gratuitous and exploitative feeling of the scene, and that's before his soul is captured in a mirror that one of the men lynching him thought to bring along for some illogical reason. It's supposedly justified by the Candyman wanting to show Annie what happened to him, but the writers should have had the restraint to leave it well alone, as it's only there to provide the usual only-way-to-kill-the-monster plot point so beloved of slasher sequels.The Mardi Gras setting adds some colour but has nothing to do with the story and gives us the irrelevant, at times nonsensical radio show that weaves through the movie. The change of location also weakens the Candyman mythos, because an urban legend in one part of a town I can believe, but now apparently everyone in the civilised world has heard of, and lives in fear of, the character. The film tries too hard to turn him into a horror icon along the lines of Freddy or Michael Myers - and it succeeds only too well, because this time around the impact has gone, too much detail is revealed about his origin and the story is a pale imitation of what's gone before. All of which is pretty much par for the course for horror sequels, but as usual, demystifying the central character does nothing but make him less interesting.

The two main characters, John and Russell see no point in living life like lazy sleezeballs so they join the military for some fun. This is where the stupidity starts.John and Russell and put in a recruit squad including other morons. Sgt. Hulka is the typical hard-ass drill instructor who seems to always be punishing the two main characters for trying to act funny and cool (obvious cliché). There are many instances in this movie that I found completely ridiculous. The first one would have to be basic training when the recruits are with the mortars and accidentally almost kill Hulka which results in him just being hospitalized. The recruits don't really receive any punishment (like kicked out or court martial) but strong resentment from Hulka. Secondly would have to be when John and Russell are found breaking military law which obviously causes two female MPs to magically fall in love with them, sneak into an officers nearby house, and immediately have sex. Sexist and disgusting? Check.When the recruits realize that they are pretty much idiots, and graduation is coming soon it serves as a time for John to finally act like a leader. This sounds good that they may actually take the army seriously, but they don't. John makes some stupid over-patriotic speech about how We are in the U.S. Army, the best army ever. We've been *kicking ass for over 200 years* (lol; don't you remember the Korean War and Vietnam, John?). Anyhow, this speech encourages the recruits to then do a one-night transformation for the next day which is graduation. They show up at the ceremony late, marching in like a bunch of kindergartens, and do a completely awkward, and un-military like march singing pop songs. This is supposedly their one night transformation. Yet even with this stupid display, the high ranking officers pick John and his recruits over EVERY OTHER RECRUIT PLATOON which acted more military than they did. They are sent to a NATO country on a special assignment which is testing a new EM-50 Urban Assault Vehicle (in reality a GMC motor home lol!).This assignment is too much for Russell and John, and they decide to go to Germany by stealing the EM-50 UAV to meet up with the pretty female MPs they screwed with back in the U.S. Sgt. Hulka finds out what John and Russell did, and take the other recruits to retrieve the EM-50 motor home back. Somehow, they take a wrong turn into Czechoslovakia and are captured by the occupying Soviet Army. Russell, John, and the MP girls go to Czechoslovakia to rescue the men. This movie tries to portray how easy it is for American troops to invade a Soviet-bloc nation by just smashing through a roadblock. Not to mention, these idiots could have started World War III for their dumb actions! Russell, John, and the MPs enter the town the recruits are held in, rescue them, defeat a huge army of Soviet soldiers, blow up tanks, and survive rockets and grenades all thanks to the GMC Motor Home being super protective (okay?). They all then return back to the United States being heroes and calling the Soviets pu--ies which is an over-exaggeration because how could a motor home beat an entire Soviet division? Pro-American anti-Soviet propaganda is why, then again this film was made 3\/4 way through the Cold War.I do not recommend this movie, it is boring, absurd, and ridiculous. If you like watching a film where buffoons become heroes in an unreal way, then this is for you.

The two main characters, John and Russell see no point in living life like lazy sleezeballs so they join the military for some fun. This is where the stupidity starts.John and Russell and put in a recruit squad including other morons. Sgt. Hulka is the typical hard-ass drill instructor who seems to always be punishing the two main characters for trying to act funny and cool (obvious cliché). There are many instances in this movie that I found completely ridiculous. The first one would have to be basic training when the recruits are with the mortars and accidentally almost kill Hulka which results in him just being hospitalized. The recruits don't really receive any punishment (like kicked out or court martial) but strong resentment from Hulka. Secondly would have to be when John and Russell are found breaking military law which obviously causes two female MPs to magically fall in love with them, sneak into an officers nearby house, and immediately have sex. Sexist and disgusting? Check.When the recruits realize that they are pretty much idiots, and graduation is coming soon it serves as a time for John to finally act like a leader. This sounds good that they may actually take the army seriously, but they don't. John makes some stupid over-patriotic speech about how We are in the U.S. Army, the best army ever. We've been *kicking ass for over 200 years* (lol; don't you remember the Korean War and Vietnam, John?). Anyhow, this speech encourages the recruits to then do a one-night transformation for the next day which is graduation. They show up at the ceremony late, marching in like a bunch of kindergartens, and do a completely awkward, and un-military like march singing pop songs. This is supposedly their one night transformation.

That is especially true in the case of Vanilla Ice, a man whose lack of discernible talent, coupled with his persistence on building a cottage industry upon one silly rap song, brought about the demise of his career in the early 90s almost before it got started.Never has one man done so much with so little. Vanilla Ice - whose assumed stage name was apparently an improvement over Robbie Van Winkle - built his public persona on a square-jawed, white-as-an-eggshell rapper who could dance like Hammer and lay down some made rhymes, whatever that means. He was also persistently dedicated to forming his own language based on annoying, yet marketable, buzzwords Word to ya mutha and Vanilla Ice melts in ya mouth not in ya hand. Wordsworth, he ain't.Added to his lack of talent, Vanilla Ice became a brand name, culminating his strange association with the Ninja Turtles. Yet, even THAT wasn't the most ridiculous choice made about his career. The low-point was his desire &#x96; after proving every other lack of originality &#x96; to become a movie star.NOW there's a problem. Here he's entering the movie world, my world. Its one thing for this egotistical blowhard to take a wrecking ball to the world of rap music, but it's quite another for him to infiltrate the world of movies. Fortunately his singular effort was so horrifying that he never got a chance to follow it up.If I can find one thing about Cool As Ice to be impressed by, it may be that this eggshell talent managed to find a movie that is as flat, boring and generic as he is. I'm not sure what the plan was, but based on the narrative (believe it or not, it has one), the movie seems to be wedged somewhere between an Afterschool Special and one of those annoying cereal commercials with lots of neon colors and frantic motion. All that's missing a cartoon cat.It also might be mistaken for being a remake of the Brando classic The Wild One if I were convinced that Vanilla Ice or his crew had ever even heard of that movie. The movie is set in and around the luminousness that is Vanilla Ice. He plays Johnny Van Owen, a rapper who dresses in clothes that look patched together from bits of neon fabric. He travels around with his homies on motorcycles moving from gig to gig.The image of Johnny is something to behold. When he isn't dancing and rapping (which makes up the first seven minutes of the movie) he is generally seen bathed in a swath of white light as if sent from Heaven on the back of a stupid looking yellow motorcycle. His adventure begins when he comes across Kathy (Kristen Minter), a raven-haired beauty of the 2400 SAT set (believe it or not, Minter has the role originally offered to Gwyneth Paltrow).It isn't enough for she and Johnny to simply have a relationship, but the movie gives her a jerko boyfriend (Victor DiMattia) and a father (played Family Ties star Michael Gross) who is in the Witness Protection Program. Oh, and there's a little brother who thinks Johnny is the second coming.I must stop here and talk about an issue that can no longer go ignored. The issue being Janusz Kaminski, the great Polish cinematographer whose career was capped by an Oscar win for Schindler's List and then such distinguished credits as Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Jerry Maquire, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly and Lincoln. YET, his career began with the Vanilla Ice vehicle Cool As Ice. You have to wonder if he leaves it off his resume.In doing some digging, I find a quote from the great D.P. and I uncovered this one Truly, when you look at a horse, there are no emotions in its eyes.

But we also still have that critique of Grigson -- we see what he said about Adams, a man with no history of criminal acts or violence, after only fifteen minutes with him.This change in focus lead to a better film, most likely (though Erroll Morris has an incredible track record for good documentaries). We now get to see a wider picture of eyewitness testimony, the prejudice of the area (which includes a thriving KKK) and more.Adams' case was reviewed and he was released from prison approximately a year after the film's release. Now that is the sign of a powerful film, and what makes documentaries so great.

Yet another work and lessons in progress.I was extremely fond of the lead performances and the capture of just the right sights and sounds of a busy New York City apartment.

I thank him for taking that chance to bring it to an audience who has the patience and sentimentality to cherish every moment.
