The script is something that makes this film a bench mark to a new genre, it becomes more complex as the plot thickens, yet when broken down it is simplistic, you feel drawn in by it and not quite sure what might happen next, mainly because of the many other sub plots that run alongside the main story.

I agree that it shaped culture from the 1990s and beyond because it shed light on film-making's ability to function as an underground Americana social commentary, dealing with taboo themes and gritty content but twisting it with a dose of black humor in its eclectic dialogue of rough poetry that plays on ironic wit and borders on poker faced matter-of-fact cynically irreverent pretentiousness. Now, my qualm essentially is that with such a quality film, we can raise critique of it to the level of thematic analyses and subsequently, the broader sense mass pop culture influence that the film through no fault of its own, but given its impact and critical acclaim, invariably glosses over. Whilst 'Redemption' and intervention may be the themes central to the film as evidenced by th story where each character has to make an error, face judgement and then redeems themselves, inasmuch as that helps Pulp Fiction get dubbed as one of the greatest films of all time, and the quintessential nouveaux independent film industry's kick-starter, what I disagree with is that the film's cult status takes it to the point where the film is seen as redemptive in itself as an entity. True the film may deal with all issues from the oddball and in a very rambunctious way make dark humor acceptable, but it does not change the fact that there is an issue not so much with social responsibility (screw that) but more so with a question I have about purpose. I personally cannot (not that anyone cares about my opinion anyway) in my view give this film top billing because on top of the fact that it deliberately misquotes biblical scripture to prove Samuel Jackson's character was basically a pseudo philosophical inanity designed to flatter to deceive, I actually start to wonder whether that element was a synonymous microcosm of what the film was doing in general- flattering to deceive? And more so because I concomitantly wonder, just what is the point of Pulp Fiction anyway? It carries no greater lacing, no greater meaning, and other than being new and refreshing as compared to the commercial fare grinded out at its time and in the wake of its immediate predecessors, by those tokens could only possibly be a revolutionary film, and not a great film, certainly not as lofty as its accolades thus far have deemed it. Then again, perhaps that too is a rhetorical question given that the quote at the start goes, to deal with lurid subject matter characteristically put on rough, unfinished paper. Maybe we can substitute paper for film? The problem with this is that I find it serves itself more as an anti-mainstream film (speculating that until 1994 all or most films including the cult classics that it references) proud to linger over its ostensibly 'classic' small stories. It pompously celebrates itself with every element of itself (that I've listed at the start of this review) carrying a touch of over-rated pretentiousness to the film such that it assumes just assembling references to great film styles (now we know Tarantino paid lots of homage to all the great films he watched whilst still a video store clerk) makes it capable of being a top film. In my opinion, this is no fault of the film per se but more so the expectations raised by such an over-rated film.

Exorcist 2 took the Georgetown incident, the skyrocketed it into the ultimate final conflict over Good and Evil with all of mankind hanging in the balance. Life goes on in Exorcist 3. Real life. Kinderman is still a detective who is deceptively perceptive; Dyer is still a priest with a great personality and an addiction to lemon drops, and we're fifteen years after the events of the first film.In the spirit of the original Exorcist, Blatty hands the majority of the running time to character development of the key players and to exposition (a bit too much exposition, in my book.) My favorite character without a doubt has to be Father Joseph Dyer, and I was delighted to see him return in this film (albeit, in small doses again.) I grinned every time he and Lieutenant Kinderman appeared in the same scene to ultimately banter back and forth with some slick and entertaining dialogue. Blatty nailed the writing, and Scott and Flanders played the scenes beautifully. I really responded to the friendship these two characters shared, and I feel it rings more true in a more sophisticated fashion than many film's attempt at on screen friendships.Listen to their dialogue, and Kinderman and Dyer are at each other's throat constantly, but underneath lay a deep respect and admiration for one another &#150; a conviction that these two truly have known each other for fifteen years. Kinderman visits Dyer in the hospital and brings him a stuffed animal and fast food. Is that for me? Dyer asks. Kinderman replies, I found it in the street. As the plot unfolds and brings out the Gemini killer, I observed that Exorcist III makes a truly daring and potentially costly move &#150; and I'm not referring to using two different actors playing the same man (although that moment effectively disorients me even when I know it's coming). Exorcist III dares to deliver pages upon pages upon pages of exposition and dialogue from within the confines of a limited setting. One room.The technical side of film-making and acting carry these scenes &#150; the camera angles, the lighting, the performances of Scott and Dourif. In the hands of the wrong director and the wrong actors a scene like this would evolve from boring to unbearable in a matter of seconds. Exorcist III, unfortunately, doesn't quite hit its mark; however, the film does sustain these scenes for awhile with some exquisite lighting and shot composition. George C. Scott and Brad Dourif are seated opposite each other on either side of the frame. Ominous light pours in symmetrically from the two windows above them, faintly echoing the cover art of the first film.Who are you? Kinderman demands, to which the psychopath answers, I am no one. Again, echoing the first film. Dourif explodes then recedes into long winded, seemingly random rambles with loud high peaks and low quiet valleys &#150; breaking up the exposition into irrelevant anecdotes, songs, and animal noises that truly paint the Gemini in the colors of a psychopath.As stated previously, the scene does not quite hit its mark; but it fairs far better than I would have expected. And it did, after all, set that mark pretty high.The film's finale, however, has no ambition and fails. The ending breaks dramatically from the novel, opting for a punched up Exorcism-inclusive ending written solely for the screen featuring a character not in book &#150; a character barely developed for the movie. It feels rushed. It feels written in to pander to the expectations of its audience. It might have worked had Blatty better integrated its elements, namely Father Morning's character, into the storyline. And I don't think the novel's downplayed ending would have worked very well for the film either.I find it curious and quite bothersome, though, that some inconsistencies popped up in a sequel helmed by the author of the original novel\/film. Kinderman has a picture of himself with Karras, and later describes Karras as his best friend &#150; in the original Exorcist (both the film and the novel) they interacted, yes, and we could see the seeds of a fruitful friendship planted . . . but did it really have time to manifest before Karras' death? Granted Kinderman is a quirky man, known for speaking his mind and saying things out of the blue, but still I don't think Kinderman's fondness for Karras would have been diminished at all if left at, He was a great guy. Told me I looked like Paul Newman. I would have liked to have known him better. Bought him coffee. Talked about movies. Especially with how Kinderman's friendship with Father Dyer somewhat mirrors what could have been had Karras survived.Oh well, so Exorcist III doesn't hit a grand slam like the first film, but it also doesn't strike out like Heretic. I appreciate this film for going in a completely different direction from the original film in its narrative, in its tone, and in its agenda. Gone is the bedroom with a little girl possessed by a demon, and Exorcist III never looks back. Blatty understands that a sequel can continue in the spirit of the original while striking entirely new territory.Initially, I truly enjoyed this film; however, upon watching it a second time I realized that I had originally watched it back-to-back with Heretic. Any film juxtapose to Heretic will feel like a great movie. I still like Exorcist III &#150; it's a decent movie &#150; I just think it's flawed. Possessed by a few bad decisions, if you will.

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"15 November 2005","score":"","review":" The thing I appreciate about Exorcist III is that it doesn't feel obligated to up the stakes. Exorcist 2 took the Georgetown incident, the skyrocketed it into the ultimate final conflict over Good and Evil with all of mankind hanging in the balance. Life goes on in Exorcist 3. Real life. Kinderman is still a detective who is deceptively perceptive; Dyer is still a priest with a great personality and an addiction to lemon drops, and we're fifteen years after the events of the first film.In the spirit of the original Exorcist, Blatty hands the majority of the running time to character development of the key players and to exposition (a bit too much exposition, in my book.) My favorite character without a doubt has to be Father Joseph Dyer, and I was delighted to see him return in this film (albeit, in small doses again.) I grinned every time he and Lieutenant Kinderman appeared in the same scene to ultimately banter back and forth with some slick and entertaining dialogue. Blatty nailed the writing, and Scott and Flanders played the scenes beautifully. I really responded to the friendship these two characters shared, and I feel it rings more true in a more sophisticated fashion than many film's attempt at on screen friendships.Listen to their dialogue, and Kinderman and Dyer are at each other's throat constantly, but underneath lay a deep respect and admiration for one another &#150; a conviction that these two truly have known each other for fifteen years. Kinderman visits Dyer in the hospital and brings him a stuffed animal and fast food. Is that for me? Dyer asks. Kinderman replies, I found it in the street. As the plot unfolds and brings out the Gemini killer, I observed that Exorcist III makes a truly daring and potentially costly move &#150; and I'm not referring to using two different actors playing the same man (although that moment effectively disorients me even when I know it's coming). Exorcist III dares to deliver pages upon pages upon pages of exposition and dialogue from within the confines of a limited setting. One room.The technical side of film-making and acting carry these scenes &#150; the camera angles, the lighting, the performances of Scott and Dourif. In the hands of the wrong director and the wrong actors a scene like this would evolve from boring to unbearable in a matter of seconds. Exorcist III, unfortunately, doesn't quite hit its mark; however, the film does sustain these scenes for awhile with some exquisite lighting and shot composition. George C. Scott and Brad Dourif are seated opposite each other on either side of the frame. Ominous light pours in symmetrically from the two windows above them, faintly echoing the cover art of the first film.Who are you? Kinderman demands, to which the psychopath answers, I am no one. Again, echoing the first film. Dourif explodes then recedes into long winded, seemingly random rambles with loud high peaks and low quiet valleys &#150; breaking up the exposition into irrelevant anecdotes, songs, and animal noises that truly paint the Gemini in the colors of a psychopath.As stated previously, the scene does not quite hit its mark; but it fairs far better than I would have expected. And it did, after all, set that mark pretty high.The film's finale, however, has no ambition and fails. The ending breaks dramatically from the novel, opting for a punched up Exorcism-inclusive ending written solely for the screen featuring a character not in book &#150; a character barely developed for the movie. It feels rushed. It feels written in to pander to the expectations of its audience. It might have worked had Blatty better integrated its elements, namely Father Morning's character, into the storyline. And I don't think the novel's downplayed ending would have worked very well for the film either.I find it curious and quite bothersome, though, that some inconsistencies popped up in a sequel helmed by the author of the original novel\/film. Kinderman has a picture of himself with Karras, and later describes Karras as his best friend &#150; in the original Exorcist (both the film and the novel) they interacted, yes, and we could see the seeds of a fruitful friendship planted . . . but did it really have time to manifest before Karras' death? Granted Kinderman is a quirky man, known for speaking his mind and saying things out of the blue, but still I don't think Kinderman's fondness for Karras would have been diminished at all if left at, He was a great guy. Told me I looked like Paul Newman. I would have liked to have known him better. Bought him coffee. Talked about movies. Especially with how Kinderman's friendship with Father Dyer somewhat mirrors what could have been had Karras survived.Oh well, so Exorcist III doesn't hit a grand slam like the first film, but it also doesn't strike out like Heretic. I appreciate this film for going in a completely different direction from the original film in its narrative, in its tone, and in its agenda. Gone is the bedroom with a little girl possessed by a demon, and Exorcist III never looks back. Blatty understands that a sequel can continue in the spirit of the original while striking entirely new territory.Initially, I truly enjoyed this film; however, upon watching it a second time I realized that I had originally watched it back-to-back with Heretic.

Basically, the title characters are introduced in reverse order, (The Ugly) Tuco (Eli Wallach) is the wanted outlaw caring only about himself and wealth, (The Bad) Sentenza aka Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) is the hit-man who will finish a job and get the reward, and (The Good) the Stranger, or Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is the professional gunslinger trying to earn a few dollars. The stranger and Tuco form a partnership making money off Tuco's bounty, but the Stranger wants to finish it, and Tuco punishes him making him suffer from heat and thirst. Going across the desert they come across a crashed horse and carriage, with the only survivor, Bill Carson (Antonio Casale) revealing that he and some other men have buried some gold in a cemetery. Tuco only knows the name of the cemetery, but the Stranger knows the name on the grave its buried in, so they must keep each other alive as they travel to this cemetery. Angel Eyes meanwhile, who was looking for Carson, knows that the Stranger and Tuco know where the cemetery is, so he is hoping to get there before they do.

Based on the Leopold-Loeb murders, this is a pretty simple premise with no shock tactics, no surprise ending, but it's all mounting tension.John Dall and Farley Granger play college students Brandon Shaw and Phillip Morgan -- lovers even though it's all implicit -- who kick the first scene strangling another college mate, played by Dick Hogan. The instrument they use is the title of the film and will make its appearance on more than one occasion which will at one point send poor Morgan over the edge as he is consumed with guilt and fear. Nevertheless, they have planned a dinner party over a trunk holding Hogan's body, and as the guests arrive, they begin an increasingly dark game of cat and mouse and at one point it seems they actually want to be discovered, but it's all a ruse. Shaw, the Machiavellian of the piece, admires writer and thinker Rupert Cadell played by James Stewart and has materialized Cadell's bleak thoughts by committing an act of murder. What he doesn't know is that Cadell will force them not only to confess to the murder, but to surrender to justice.ROPE is an interesting film in the way it treats its homosexual subtext. Hayes Code aside, you don't have to see an actual physical contact to know that Shaw and Morgan are lovers and that Dall is clearly the dominant male to Morgan's almost effeminate, weaker, submissive male. There also seems to be some unexplored subtext involving the blind admiration Shaw feels for Cadell, who's wife is never mentioned and who's books told about the 'darkness' of the world. This is not implying Cadell is also homosexual, but the message is certainly clear due to the fact the script had it that Cadell had had a fling with one of the students. Why else would Shaw talk to Cadell with puppy dog eyes, and go to such lengths to impress him? At a time when being gay was unspoken of finding each other in itself was anything less than a miracle, especially if this someone had some deep thoughts which were mutual. Natural for Shaw to want to catch his eye, win Cadell's approval, not knowing he had twisted his work and made it ugly.Technically, again, the Director proved he knew his ropes in terms of how he wanted us to see his picture. The suspense he creates doesn't lie in will the killer be revealed -- had he not included the opening shot of David's murder we might wonder if they actually had done the deed or were merely trying to shock their guests -- but how long will it take for their murder to be revealed. Long takes make us see the trunk at all times, never forgetting that despite the jokes and witty banter about astrology, there is a corpse waiting to be found. Along the way, Hitchcock allows his actors to talk about murder and play with the where is David motif until it's certain something must happen, and then, finally, it does, in the form of Jimmy Stewart's deft handling of the scene in which he unmasks the boys. Suspenseful, funny, and ultimately tragic this sums up the experience of watching ROPE.

I was a senior in college at the time. A few years later, when I was buying movies on video tape, I bought this movie and have viewed it from time to time since then. What strikes me is that not only is this movie an extremely dark comedy (in some ways almost a Horror movie) but one that has a lot of subtle things that are bubbling below the surface. Before getting into detail about that, I want to give a synopsis of the story. THE WAR OF THE ROSES stars Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner as a Yuppie couple named Oliver and Barbara Rose. At first, they seem to be very happy. Oliver is a lawyer and Barbara is a housewife. They raise a son and a daughter and live in a very big house that Barabara has spent years decorating. However, she decides one day she wants out of the marriage. Oliver does not believe it and from this point on, things get from bad to worse. Danny De Vito, who plays Gavin, Oliver's best friend and lawyer, tries to talk sense into him but Oliver won't listen to his advice. From this point until the end of the movie, each spouse is constantly figuring out how to outsmart the other. A big part of their problem is that both of them are very stubborn and refuse to sell the house.When I first watched THE WAR OF THE ROSES, I basically looked at it from the viewpoint that things fell apart when Barbara announced that she wanted a divorce. However, after viewing THE WAR OF THE ROSES a couple of times, I began to notice that there was a lot of tension between the two main characters throughout the movie. A good example is when Oliver and Barbara are still living in their apartment, they invite some of Oliver's co-workers over for dinner. Barbara starts telling the story of how she acquired some glassware on a trip she and Oliver took in Paris. Oliver feels she is rambling on so he cuts her off by saying, To make a long story short... and he finishes the story for her. She is obviously annoyed by it and when Oliver comments that everybody had a good time at the party, she says To make a long story short, No! Not only that but she is put off by what she calls his phony laugh. Here are some other examples of the tension between the couple leading up to time of the breakup When Barbara decides to go into business for herself by catering, she wants Oliver to look at her contract. He berates her by calling it a little contract and uses it to swipe a fly. Around that same time, Oliver receives a phone call from a client named Larabee. Barbara resents the fact that he is obsessed by this client so while he is on the phone, she turns on all the appliances in the house in an attempt to show how she feels. Another example involves Barbara and Oliver having dinner one night. Not much is said but the camera angles and the body language show it all. A major scene that shows the tension between Barbara and Oliver, I think, is when Oliver is having what he thinks is a heart attack in the middle of a business lunch. Despite Barbara's acting like she is concerned, she refuses to go to the hospital to see him. Naturally, Oliver is upset and resentful of this. Again, as I said, all of this was before the divorce occurred and this is to show that what may have seemed like minor annoyances at one point grew into fights between the two. After the two break up, neither of them want to budge and it causes friction for everyone involved. By that, I mean their kids, Gavin and the housekeeper. Because the Roses were unwilling to compromise, they destroyed practically everything they ever had. I would say that the moral of the story is for a couple who is about to be divorced, to try to work things out so the spouses can get through the divorce as painless as possible. This is the point that Danny De Vito's character essentially tells his client in the movie. It is worth noting that in addition to acting in THE WAR OF THE ROSES, Danny De Vito directed it as well. As was true with THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN, Danny De Vito specializes in directing very dark-comedy. I heard once that Michael Douglas commented that when making this movie, he and Kathleen Turner had to remind each other that they were still friends. Having watched this movie, I can understand why!

At first, they seem to be very happy. Oliver is a lawyer and Barbara is a housewife. They raise a son and a daughter and live in a very big house that Barabara has spent years decorating. However, she decides one day she wants out of the marriage. Oliver does not believe it and from this point on, things get from bad to worse. Danny De Vito, who plays Gavin, Oliver's best friend and lawyer, tries to talk sense into him but Oliver won't listen to his advice. From this point until the end of the movie, each spouse is constantly figuring out how to outsmart the other. A big part of their problem is that both of them are very stubborn and refuse to sell the house.When I first watched THE WAR OF THE ROSES, I basically looked at it from the viewpoint that things fell apart when Barbara announced that she wanted a divorce. However, after viewing THE WAR OF THE ROSES a couple of times, I began to notice that there was a lot of tension between the two main characters throughout the movie. A good example is when Oliver and Barbara are still living in their apartment, they invite some of Oliver's co-workers over for dinner. Barbara starts telling the story of how she acquired some glassware on a trip she and Oliver took in Paris. Oliver feels she is rambling on so he cuts her off by saying, To make a long story short... and he finishes the story for her. She is obviously annoyed by it and when Oliver comments that everybody had a good time at the party, she says To make a long story short, No! Not only that but she is put off by what she calls his phony laugh. Here are some other examples of the tension between the couple leading up to time of the breakup When Barbara decides to go into business for herself by catering, she wants Oliver to look at her contract. He berates her by calling it a little contract and uses it to swipe a fly. Around that same time, Oliver receives a phone call from a client named Larabee. Barbara resents the fact that he is obsessed by this client so while he is on the phone, she turns on all the appliances in the house in an attempt to show how she feels. Another example involves Barbara and Oliver having dinner one night. Not much is said but the camera angles and the body language show it all. A major scene that shows the tension between Barbara and Oliver, I think, is when Oliver is having what he thinks is a heart attack in the middle of a business lunch. Despite Barbara's acting like she is concerned, she refuses to go to the hospital to see him. Naturally, Oliver is upset and resentful of this. Again, as I said, all of this was before the divorce occurred and this is to show that what may have seemed like minor annoyances at one point grew into fights between the two. After the two break up, neither of them want to budge and it causes friction for everyone involved. By that, I mean their kids, Gavin and the housekeeper. Because the Roses were unwilling to compromise, they destroyed practically everything they ever had. I would say that the moral of the story is for a couple who is about to be divorced, to try to work things out so the spouses can get through the divorce as painless as possible. This is the point that Danny De Vito's character essentially tells his client in the movie. It is worth noting that in addition to acting in THE WAR OF THE ROSES, Danny De Vito directed it as well. As was true with THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN, Danny De Vito specializes in directing very dark-comedy. I heard once that Michael Douglas commented that when making this movie, he and Kathleen Turner had to remind each other that they were still friends. Having watched this movie, I can understand why! Anyway, I recommend THE WAR OF THE ROSES to those viewers who love black comedy as this fits that description to a T.

I should have known it would be this weird when I heard it was one of Terry Gilliam's (12 Monkeys, Brazil) favorite films. 'City of Lost Children' will have you in a state of 'what-the-hell-is-going-on?' during it's entire 112 minute runtime, but personally I thought it was a very well made film not to mention original as hell. The off-the-wall story that resembles a children's book written by Jeffrey Dahmer, takes place in a dark, gloom city in France, surrounded by a port of green water. Somewhere in the ocean lays a laboratory owned by the incredibly weird and frightening scientist Krank (Daniel Emilfork), his pushy dwarf wife Mademoiselle Bismuth (Mirielle Mossee), his four cloned sons (all played hysterically by Dominique Pinon) and Krank's brother who is just a brain in a tub of water (voiced by Jean-Louis Trintignant). The evil scientist Krank can't have dreams so he sends out his army of cyclopes to capture small children and steal their dreams. One day Krank's army kidnaps the little brother of a circus strongman, One (Ron Perlman - Hellboy), the story's hero. One, with the help of a band of kiddie pick-pocket thieves led by the compassionate 10-year-old Miette (Judith Vittet) try to get One's brother back from the evil clutches of Krank. The film is beautifully shot with out of this world visual effects, cinematography and makeup (all of which should have gained the film Oscar nominations in 1995). The direction is wonderful, and the writing is solid for the most part. The acting is led with top-notch performances from American actor Ron Perlman and the delightfully deranged Daniel Emilfork. Dominique Pinon is wonderful at adding much-needed comic relief while everyone else in the cast kind of runs in together. 'City of Lost Children' is a French film with English subtitles, and I feel a little was lost due to the language transfer. If you enjoy that kind of 'bizarre' film-making, I think you'll believe 'City of Lost Children' to be a terrific find.

It's epic in scope, provocative in nature, and expansive in its subject matter. The only thing it's lacking is a plot and characters worth following.It's absolutely hilarious how hard Heretic tries to be a good movie. Watching the film is like watching a kid pulling, and pulling, and pulling with all his might. Pulling with every once of his soul. Pulling with all of his being . . . and he never realizes the sign on the door says Push. The lesson Exorcist II learned the hard way is that without an entrance &#150; without the audience's intrigue (that precious suspension of disbelief) &#150; the audience will not care to interpret the visual metaphors regarding the phenomena of synced consciousness, transcending the body, and limited human understanding. It's not that Exorcist II lacked meaningful substance, it's that I didn't care. And that's why Heretic fails as a film.At the forefront of the film's turnoffs is Father Lamont. The character is both written and played one dimensionally. The problem is only compounded by the fact the one dimension we get is both stale and repulsive. Father Lamont has no life. He has no personality. He has a handful of facial expressions. His calling is to single-handedly find the weapon (the healers) to stand against Satan. His faith goes beyond a calling, it goes beyond a mission, it's a full blown obsession that makes me want to see him locked into a psychiatric ward. He strikes me as the type of priest who would drive the atrocity known as the inquisition or the Salem Witch trials. The last thing I wanted to do was follow him and his one note Must stop evil attitude for the entire film.The original film scored points for humanizing its servants of God.

Friedkin and Blatty made Father Karras and Father Dyer full blown sympathetic characters &#150; characters I wanted to follow for the length of the film. John Boorman and William Goodhart make Father Lamont the equivalent of the holy Terminator with less interesting characteristics, less memorable lines, and a smaller emoting range than our favorite cyberdyne systems model 101. It doesn't work.On a similar note, the Exorcist was an intimate story about a handful of normal people living their lives, dealing with their troubles, and just trying to survive. The Exorcist was epic only through suggestion &#150; through the imagery of Merrin in Iraq, climaxing as he stands across the frame from the statue of Pazuzu. Exorcist II, by contrast, lives, breathes, eats, and sleeps Epic. This isn't the battle over a few people's faith, and the soul of a little girl &#150; we're constantly bombarded with reminders that this is the war between Good and Evil.In the spirit of the film, let me say that again This is the ultimate battle between Good and Eeeeevil! And it's not that it breaks from the stance of the original film that bothers me &#150; it's the fact that Exorcist II can't stand on its own in its new position. The film goes so epic that it loses touch with its audience. I really don't care about Pazuzu's grand mission to destroy the new breed of healers\/warriors of God in a battle between superpowers with us as their pawns. The film wants to go in that direction, and I don't want to follow it. Every creative impulse within me resists it, stating, This is a bad idea. Don't go there. Alas, the film goes there.The nail in the coffin, though, isn't where the film goes. The nail in the coffin is the method in which it uses to get there. Heretic uses deliberate visual metaphors that draw attention to themselves &#150; like giant billboards, screaming Look, I'm a deep meaningful movie! I find it ironic how the film drains the power and meaning from its images by flaunting (dare I say prostituting) them. Granted, the film addresses some interesting topics about joint consciousness and the psychological effects of hypnosis, and it jumps to represent them with the cinematic arts using methods that strike me as both unsophisticated and primitive &#150; like something a novice filmmaker would churn out in film school. As a result, the film sells itself cheaply, exploits itself, and whimsically throws out its deepest darkest secrets front and center of the screen, which leaves the viewer with two options Believe what the film says, or believe how the film says it. I take option B - the film is a cheap whore.But surely &#150; surely &#150; one of my all time favorite composers, Ennio Morricone, would contribute a positive element to the film.

I literally perked up reading his name in the credits and mouthed a quiet yes! But for the life of me, despite my deep admiration and affection for his body of work, I did not like his score for Exorcist II Heretic.In the end, while Heretic does have a few powerful moments, they're just so vastly outnumbered by, to be quite frank, boring or silly sequences just begging for abusive commentary. Take for example the numerous times the process of hypnosis is shown &#150; characters staring dumbly at a blinking light, speaking in the generic delayed hypnotized monotone. Who cares to see this (not only once, but several times)?

There are directors who have done nail-biting suspense, usually drenched in subtext, like the Director, Alfred Hitchcock. There are others who can do whatever they want and create beautiful, detached yet powerful films like Stanley Kubrick. Then there are ones who are brilliant with ensembles, telling stories which converge and often overlap within a main plot. One of them is the great Woody Allen. The other one is Robert Altman.GOSFORD PARK is an update of Jean Renoir's 1939 film LE REGLE DU JEU, in which wealthy relatives of an aristocrat come to a shooting party at a country home. Here, because of the obviously strained relationships between the host and his family has been less than amicable, it serves as a springboard where everyone's worst behavior and heretofore concealed feelings towards each other really come forth with an undertone of mean-spirited cruelty just brimming below the surface, while the servants act as non-entities when in their employers' presence but occasionally break into.Boasting one of the best introduction sequences ever, itself lengthy but necessary, GOSFORD PARK is a tour-de-force of narration that recalls Jane Austen's work. We first see Mary Maceachran (Kelly MacDonald, playing innocence that becomes a keen observer), maid to Lady Constance Trentham (Dame Maggie Smith, having a splendid time in her role), and Lady Trentham's flighty demands and annoyed conversation as they make their way to Gosford Park. They cross paths with movie actor Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam), his agent Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban), and Weissman's protégé, Henry Denton (Ryan Phillippe), who is the only one who doesn't introduce himself proper for reasons made clear later on, also heading towards the manor. The hellos are strained -- Lady Trentham is clearly not the friendly type --, but Mary is starstruck like the young girl she is. Once they (and the other guests) reach the house, activity is buzzing almost factory-like (factory being an important term here) as the housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren, taking self-control and omniscient stillness to a whole different level in a performance that has to be analyzed frame by frame), calmly gives out her orders. However, Altman, Fellowes, and Patrick Doyle bring a little extra dose to the scene the moment Robert Parks (Clive Owen) enters the picture and introduces himself to Mrs. Wilson while Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins) passes them by and turns to hear. Not soon after, the camera makes a zoom into a bottle of poison itself symbolic since immediately after that, the rest of the characters begin to show hints of their own shared poison. Isobel McCordle (Camila Rutherford), William (Michael Gambon) and Sylvia McCordle's (Kristin Scott Thomas) daughter, is carrying on with Freddie Nesbitt (James Wilby) who is tied to a marriage of convenience to Mabel (Claudie Blakely) whom he feels ashamed of. The Stockbridges are also on the outs, Lord Raymond (Charles Dance) preferring the safety of his own kind according to Louisa Stockbridge (Geraldine Sommerville) who is one of William McCordle's many women.

It is the equivalent of an abstract painting that upon scrutiny reveals layers and layers of what people dare not express up front and direct. This makes it, in fact, a delicious mystery and an open secret at the same time. Death and its cause-effect, an element ever present in an Altman film, never looked more elegantly funny. In this movie, with death coming as a murder (or double-murder if you will) to a widely disliked character, only Louisa Stockbridge expresses concern and even then it's somewhat insincere.

This doesn't necessarily solve anything or everything that occurs in GOSFORD PARK -- some plots are hinted at and that is fine -- but it does present an intricate comedy of manners of a time gone by just before WWII when Upstairs people mingled and shared their lives with the Downstairs people.Edited 11.17.2006 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 November 2005","score":"62 out of 74 people found the following review useful","review":" There are directors who can direct huge, massive Cecil B. deMille epics like Peter Jackson.

The other one is Robert Altman.GOSFORD PARK is an update of Jean Renoir's 1939 film LE REGLE DU JEU, in which wealthy relatives of an aristocrat come to a shooting party at a country home. Here, because of the obviously strained relationships between the host and his family has been less than amicable, it serves as a springboard where everyone's worst behavior and heretofore concealed feelings towards each other really come forth with an undertone of mean-spirited cruelty just brimming below the surface, while the servants act as non-entities when in their employers' presence but occasionally break into.Boasting one of the best introduction sequences ever, itself lengthy but necessary, GOSFORD PARK is a tour-de-force of narration that recalls Jane Austen's work. We first see Mary Maceachran (Kelly MacDonald, playing innocence that becomes a keen observer), maid to Lady Constance Trentham (Dame Maggie Smith, having a splendid time in her role), and Lady Trentham's flighty demands and annoyed conversation as they make their way to Gosford Park. They cross paths with movie actor Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam), his agent Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban), and Weissman's protégé, Henry Denton (Ryan Phillippe), who is the only one who doesn't introduce himself proper for reasons made clear later on, also heading towards the manor. The hellos are strained -- Lady Trentham is clearly not the friendly type --, but Mary is starstruck like the young girl she is. Once they (and the other guests) reach the house, activity is buzzing almost factory-like (factory being an important term here) as the housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren, taking self-control and omniscient stillness to a whole different level in a performance that has to be analyzed frame by frame), calmly gives out her orders. However, Altman, Fellowes, and Patrick Doyle bring a little extra dose to the scene the moment Robert Parks (Clive Owen) enters the picture and introduces himself to Mrs. Wilson while Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins) passes them by and turns to hear. Not soon after, the camera makes a zoom into a bottle of poison itself symbolic since immediately after that, the rest of the characters begin to show hints of their own shared poison. Isobel McCordle (Camila Rutherford), William (Michael Gambon) and Sylvia McCordle's (Kristin Scott Thomas) daughter, is carrying on with Freddie Nesbitt (James Wilby) who is tied to a marriage of convenience to Mabel (Claudie Blakely) whom he feels ashamed of. The Stockbridges are also on the outs, Lord Raymond (Charles Dance) preferring the safety of his own kind according to Louisa Stockbridge (Geraldine Sommerville) who is one of William McCordle's many women.

Jamaica Inn was one of his few failures, a minor-league costume drama that is today of little interest except to Hitchcock completists. With Rebecca, however, he achieved one of his greatest successes, even though the story is hardly typical of his work.A number of Hitchcock's films, such as The 39 Steps or North by North-West end up with the hero and heroine falling in love, but are nevertheless essentially suspense films with an element of romance. Rebecca, however, is essentially a romance with elements of suspense. Indeed, it starts out as a romantic comedy. A young woman (we never learn her name) staying on the French Riviera with her employer Mrs Van Hopper, meets and falls in love with Maxim de Winter, a handsome older widower. There is a brief comic sequence as the two lovers try to outwit the overbearing, bullying Mrs Van Hopper and escape back to England.With the shift in location to England, the mood of the film becomes darker and more serious. We learn that Maxim is the wealthy owner of Manderley, a stately home near the Cornish coast, and that he was widowed about a year earlier when his first wife Rebecca drowned in a boating accident. The new Mrs de Winter finds it difficult to adapt to her new role as the mistress of such a large house, especially as she feels that everyone, including the servants and Maxim's friends, is comparing her unfavourably with the beautiful and accomplished Rebecca. Maxim reveals to her that his first marriage was an unhappy one as Rebecca was compulsively promiscuous and betrayed him with a number of lovers. This revelation does not, however, put her mind at rest, because evidence soon comes to light that suggests that Maxim may have killed Rebecca out of jealousy.The suspense elements of the film only occur near the end, when Maxim has to struggle to clear himself from suspicion of murder. There are no typical Hitchcock set-pieces like the crop-duster in North by North-West or the shower scene in Psycho. This is, however, one of the most atmospheric of Hitchcock's films. Although it was shot in California, the morning mists, the pine trees by the rocky coast and the Gothic mansion are all suggestive of England. (I suspect that if Hollywood were to make the film today they would try to Americanise it, but in the forties their attitude to British literature was generally more respectful).In a way this is a ghost story, although not in the literal sense of a tale of supernatural happenings. Manderley may not be literally haunted, but it is permeated by Rebecca's spirit. The old house is solid and luxurious, but it also has an oppressive air, especially for Mrs de Winter. (Max Ophuls was to conjure up a similar atmosphere in Caught, made a few years later). Rebecca does not actually appear in the film; she does not appear in the book either, but that is a first-person narrative told from the viewpoint of her successor. In the film, where the first-person perspective is largely abandoned, it would have been much easier to show her in flashback, but Hitchcock chose to resist this temptation. In my view he was right to do so. Rebecca is far more frightening as an unseen but malevolent and brooding presence than she would be if seen in the flesh.Mrs de Winter is an outsider at Manderley, partly because she is from a less privileged social background than Maxim, partly because she is the only character who never knew Rebecca personally. Maxim was probably attracted to her precisely because she was so unlike Rebecca. As she is supposed to be somewhat plain and dowdy, Joan Fontaine, one of the most attractive actresses of the period, was perhaps not physically right for the role. (Joanna David, in the 1979 TV production, seemed closer to du Maurier's conception of the character). Nevertheless, Fontaine's interpretation of the role is a very good one, making her shy and bewildered but possessed of an inner strength which enables her love for Maxim to survive.Laurence Olivier is also good as Maxim, bringing out the two sides of his character. On the one hand he is the calm, self-possessed English gentleman, on the other a man haunted by his past. The other performance which stands out is that of Judith Anderson as the sinister housekeeper Mrs Danvers. Always dressed in black, with a severe hairstyle, moving silently through the house, Mrs Danvers initially greets the new Mrs de Winter with an icy formality, but gradually becomes her chief tormentor. Although this could not be explicitly stated in the forties, there is a strong hint that Mrs Danvers is a lesbian and that she might have been in love with Rebecca. Certainly, the scene in which she stands lasciviously pawing her late employer's underwear is highly suggestive.It certainly seemed eccentric of the Academy to give this film the Best Picture award while withholding Best Director from Hitchcock. 1940 was, however, a very strong year in the history of the cinema and, excellent film though Rebecca is, I am not sure that it is necessarily a greater one than John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath, Chaplin's The Great Dictator or The Philadelphia Story, all of which were nominated. I suspect that the decision to give Best Picture to Rebecca and Best Director to Ford may have been a deliberate attempt to spread the honours more evenly. Nevertheless, Rebecca remains one of the great Hitchcock classics. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 November 2005","score":"7 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" It is strange that after arriving in Hollywood from Britain, Alfred Hitchcock should have chosen to base his first film upon a novel by Daphne du Maurier, the same author, who had provided him with the material for the last film of his British period.

This movie is very effective. I would rank this with Dr. Strangelove and The Manchurian Candidate as one of the greatest satires. Wilder is able to keep a balance between absurd parody and intelligent commentary. He very evocatively portrays the corrupting influence of the Hollywood establishment.All the actors are perfectly suited for their roles. Holden is great as the desperate and ultimately lonely writer Joe Gillis. He is willing to do most anything to keep alive his hopes of becoming a great screenwriter. He remains sympathetic of Norma (as I do), and yet disgusted by her (as I do). Swanson is almost perfect as Norma Desmond. She is grandiose, grotesque, and pitiful. She is able to disguise her true emotion with over-exaggerated melodrama.Several times on the DVD it is noted that Wilder is not considered a great visual director. I think his visuals are above par, and very effective. The scene in which Norma and Joe are watching her silent picture is a good example. She stands up into the projector light with a Gothic, almost surreal appearance. It is as though she exists merely as a two-dimensional projection. In her mind, there is no world outside of the silver screen. The New Year's Eve party is another. There is an overhead shot of Norma and Joe dancing on the tiled floor.

Holden is great as the desperate and ultimately lonely writer Joe Gillis. He is willing to do most anything to keep alive his hopes of becoming a great screenwriter. He remains sympathetic of Norma (as I do), and yet disgusted by her (as I do). Swanson is almost perfect as Norma Desmond. She is grandiose, grotesque, and pitiful.

As Kiernan investigates the phenomena a young boy takes Alameida's rosary beads from his open coffin & sells them to an American tourist. Cut to Pittsburgh where 23 year old fun loving girl Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) now has the beads in her possession after her Mother sent them to her as a present, however shortly after receiving them Frankie's world starts to fall apart as a series of terrifying events take over her life. First wounds mysteriously appear that go right through her wrists, she begins to see & hear things & while riding on the subway has a violent fit that leaves her with unexplained marks on her back. After witnessing the events on the train Father Durning (Thomas Kopache) thinks Frankie may be afflicted by the 'Stigmata' or the five wounds by which Jesus died by on the cross. He contacts the Vatican where the sinister Cardinal Daniel Houseman (Jonathan Pryce) assigns Father Kiernan to investigate which will lead him to uncover & battle corruption along with dark supernatural forces as he fights to save Frankie's life...Directed by Rupert Wainwright I actually thought Sitmata turned out to be much better then I had expected. The script by Tom Lazarus & Rick Ramage uses the traditional clichéd Christian & catholic themes like faith, the stigmata, miracles, bibles, Churches & priests as you would expect but Stigmata places these elements into a modern day inner city setting & has a young non religious female leading character. As a whole I thought the two distinct sets of themes & ideas worked well against each other to create something a bit different. The character's are pretty well fleshed out although once Frankie is possessed & Father Kiernan's investigation begins her character takes a back seat for the remainder of the film. I also have to mention the climax, what good horror film based on religious possession would not include an exorcism somewhere along the line? In the case of Stigmata it's a little low-key & don't expect any head twisting or green vomit spewing. One area where Stigmata stood out for me was it's visual style & class, director Wainwright uses plenty of close-ups, moody lighting, quick cuts, dissolves, fades & lots of MTV editing trickery. Stigmata has lots of atmosphere as well with loads of symbolic imagery like doves flying around everywhere, candles all over the place & for some reason loads of water. Almost every time Stigmata cuts to a outdoor scene it's pouring with rain & there are so many shots of dripping water it's very noticeable but as I said I really like Stigmata visually. There isn't much in the way of blood or gore, a few gory blood squirting wounds, a bit of self mutilation & a few flashbacks to Jesus being crucified. With a supposed budget of about $32,000,000 I have to say I'm not too sure where all that money went, Stigmata is a very well made film throughout with that Hollywood polish too it but $32 million to make a film with no major action or special effect sequences, no really big name actors, no exotic locations & it even needed to use footage from Money Train (1995) which I spotted straight away. The acting is very good & I felt for most of the character's. I personally think Stigmata is a decent film, don't expect a clone of The Exorcist (1973) or anything as gratuitous & you might enjoy it. A pleasant surprise & a film definitely worth at least one watch.
