[{"date":"18 June 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" 8MM brought to life a story that many film makers and production companies would have turned their nose up to, probably because of the subject matter.In case you didn't know already, 8MM is the story of Tom Wells (Cage) who is a private detective hired by a wealthy widow after she finds a 'snuff' film in her dead husband's private safe. His job find out if the film is real and if it is, identify the murdered girl. The investigative aspect of the film was very well done.The director's use of darkness and shadows from the beginning gives the film a very gritty look and places the viewer in a rather uneasy mood. The subject matter of the film makes most a bit squeamish too, so this is not for those who are easily offended or cannot tolerate graphic stories. Yet, the film is what it is and it achieves the aims of disturbing, frightening and intriguing the viewer.The performances were terrific. The old lady and her lawyer were somewhat caricatured, Cage played the transition of his character to perfection, Phoenix was also praise-worthy and most of the seedy pornography characters gave fantastic performances. Amy Morton, in particular, was excellent - but looking at her IMDb database, it appears that she does few films. Would like to see her in more roles.
