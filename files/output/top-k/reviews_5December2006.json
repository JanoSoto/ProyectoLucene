[{"date":"5 December 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Having seen this film before knowing who Andy Kaufman was, I was truly in awe of the comic genius of Carrey. I am myself A big fan of Carrey and admire the lengths he goes to create a character that is so much more than what was imagined on paper. The endearing depiction of Kaufman that Jim portrayed makes this character my favourite.I was so excited by the story of Kaufman that I had to explore his eccentric world. I watched all the episodes of Taxi with Andy in, plus the ones he refused to be in. I watched his Saturday Night Live clips and his infamous special. Kaufman brought to comedy that no (at the risk of calling him a comedian) comedian had ever done. Above all however I was fascinated at how well Carrey portrayed Kaufman. Every nuance was replicated to an auteur style degree.As a whole Foreman creates an endearing and tragic depiction of such a man who was both loved and hated. The film flows with tranquillity and you cant help but fall in love with Carrey and Kaufman. Rumour had it Edward Norton was going to take the role, in my opinion this would have been a travesty. I cant think of another actor who could play Kaufman with as much conviction as Carrey. Perhaps Spacey would have been my second call for the role. This film ranks high in both my favourite Carrey film and my favourite film. I will continue to watch it religiously.

The blood and gore of the movie made it seem realistic to me, some other movies hold back on that aspect of the move to obtain a better rating such as PG-13 but that is a mistake. The actors in this movie did a superb job. Russel crows performance was especially delightful as he inflicted pain on his opponents, his role in the film was crucial to my enjoying it. Some parts of this movie threw me off, such as the parts that had to do with the son of the late roman leader and his sister having a relationship.

And then, a couple of years ago on a whim I bought the DVD. I sat down and watched it today finally, and was pleased to see that it is as good today as it was almost 20 years ago. The story is so powerful -- the interweaving of the passions of the three main characters with the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and what it did to that country. It was refreshing to see Daniel Day-Lewis, Juliette Binocche, and Lena Olin in their youth after having seen all of them in more recent films. The performances by all three of them are worth the price of a rental alone.While there are some parts that could have been cut to reduce the almost three hour length, this is still a wonderful film that is among my top two or three favorites. It is incredibly erotic, and yet in a way that does not come across as exploitive or detached from the story. Some have complained that the movie is not faithful to the Kundera novel, but I would argue that the movie stands on its own as a work of art not to be missed.

It's a bit like In the heat of the night with the Poitier\/Stieger roles reversed. Here it's Connery in the do-gooder Poitier role while the black Fishburne takes the Stieger part.Bobby Earl is on death row for the rape and murder of a young white girl. He enlists the help of Connery's law professor to take his case on board arguing that serial killer Ed Harris has confessed to the murder while in jail. The plot is fairly predictable but is not unexciting. It's just that once we know who the bad guys are there really isn't very much else left. (The director, Arne Glimcher, never seems to be on top of the material).Although effectively the stars neither Connery or Fishburne have much to do. Luckily we have the great Ed Harris exuding genuine menace as the incarcerated serial killer, wielding his power, Hannibal Lector style from inside his prison walls, while Blair Underwood as Bobby Earl displays real promise, suave and bland enough to make you wonder if he is guilty or not.
