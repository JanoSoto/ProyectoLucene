But, as Entertainment Weekly noted, calling The Godfather a Mafia movie is like calling The Odyssey a guide to the Aegean Sea. This story of how the Corleone family rules New York with their own version of justice entails everything that makes movies good.First, the opening scene. The shot of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) sitting in his chair petting his cat sets the Don up as a fatherly - but shady - figure. Then, you see Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding the Corleones are not just a bunch of evil slime-balls. During the wedding, Michael (Al Pacino) arrives. Wearing his military uniform, Michael looks like a handsome young man - possibly an allusion to how these people are adept at deceiving other people. At the wedding, Michael meets WASP-ish outsider Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), who's naturally a little weirded out by the whole Mafia lifestyle - at one point, Michael has to tell her That's my family, Kay. That's not me. The other two sons are Sonny (James Caan), the immature playboy, and Fredo (John Cazale), the loser. And there's also the adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), now a lawyer. After a trip to Hollywood where he unsuccessfully tries to get a producer to hire singer Johnny Fontane (who apparently was not really based on Frank Sinatra), we all know what Tom does with the horse.A scene that did a really good job showing the break between 1st and 2nd generation Americans is the scene where Michael and Kay are Christmas shopping and Santa Claus is Coming to Town is playing. Vito, as an immigrant, kept many of the traditions from his native country. Michael, born and raised in the US, certainly seems less Italian that his father.Then, of course, Vito gets shot. After Michael gets revenge, he has to hide out in Sicily. While he's there...well, we all know what happens to Sonny. This prompts Vito to negotiate with the other families. But then, Michael turns out to be even more ruthless than his father.Probably the most incredible scene is when Michael presides over the baptism of Connie's child. As soon as Michael renounces Satan, things get ugly. It basically says that every time that they say something holy, someone gets slaughtered.All in all, Francis Ford Coppola created an inimitable cinematic masterpiece. And the sequel actually managed to equal the original.

Grant. He's been ordered to take 3 brigades deep into Confederate territory and destroy a critical rail supply station at a place called Newton's Station and then get his troops out the best way he can. He's ordered to take along, an army surgeon played by William Holden. Wayne's got what appears to be an unreasoning dislike of Holden and their rivalry professional and personal is what drives the plot of the Horse Soldiers.John Ford always disparaged the films he made after Wings of Eagles, but in my opinion, The Horse Soldiers is one of his finest films. Also in my humble opinion he managed to get one of John Wayne's finest film performances. Wayne's a volunteer officer, in civilian life he rose from section hand on a railroad to an construction engineer. Holden calls him section hand as a term of derision after Wayne consistently refers to him as croker.Wayne and Holden were very close personal friends and friendly rivals at the box office. That's part of the reason that The Horse Soldiers is so good, the chemistry between them. In fact when Wayne died in 1979, Holden was said to have gone on one legendary drinking binge. Who would have suspected we'd have lost him as well two years later.Holden as the doctor has a less flamboyant part than Wayne, but he makes the most of what he was given. I suspect knowing the relationship between Wayne and John Ford, he knew going in his part would be less, but he did it anyway.Anyone who thinks John Wayne incapable of acting should see the scene in the saloon at Newton's Station after the Union forces repel a Confederate attack and are about their business destroying the railroad property. In a great drunk scene he reveals to Constance Towers the reason for his hatred of the medical profession. I won't reveal it, but it's something we can all understand. Wayne did this scene so well that Ford used an abbreviated version of it in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.Ford makes marvelous use of music in there, weaving traditional Civil War era songs with the song written by Stan Jones for the film, I Left My Love. That is one catchy and infectious ballad, one of the best things written for a John Ford movie. Incidentally Stan Jones makes a brief appearance in the film as Ulysses S. Grant and does well by him.There are two in the supporting cast that deserve mention. During the Civil War Lincoln had to deal with volunteer political generals, most of whom were a flop. Willis Bouchey playing John Wayne's co-commander in the expedition captures the phenomenon to perfection. He's argumentative, arrogant, and a general pain in the butt to Wayne. It's probably Bouchey's finest screen performance.And Carleton Young also gives what I think is his finest screen performance as the one armed Confederate colonel who tries in vain to stop Wayne from completing his plans. It's a role that requires dignity and strength and Carleton Young is marvelous. In fact the contrast between Bouchey and Young as soldiers is pretty obvious.The relationship between the Section Hand and The Croker evolves during the running time of The Horse Soldiers. It's a relationship well worth seeing develop.

Sewell as a statement against animal cruelty back in 19th century England the story about Black Beauty has become since it was published in 1877, a year before Anna Sewell death, one of the most beloved and read children, as well as adult, stories about horses ever penned.Folded at Farmer Gray's, Sean Bean, farm out of the mare Duchess the young colt grew up to be a striking black horse, with a white heart-shaped star on his forehead. The horse could run with the grace of an champion Olympic track and field runner and with such blinding speed that it seemed as if he had wings attached to his hoofs. Given away to Squire Gordon, Peter Davidson, and his wife, Rosalind Ayers, the horse named by Mrs. Gordon Black Beauty had the happiest times of his life with both John Manly, Jim Carter, and young Joe Green taking care of and looking after him. It was later when Mistress Gordon's health was failing that she and her husband Squire Gordon had to move out of England to a much warmer climate, on the European continent, that life started turning bleak for the black stallion. This decision to move lead to the Gordon's dispersement of their farm and all it's horses which included Black Beauty. Sold to the snobbish and unfeeling Lady Wexmire, Eleanor Bron, who among other things had the horse, as well as the reddish or chestnut mare and white pony Ginger and Merrylegs who were also sold to her along with Black Beauty. Forced to wear a torturous bearing rein, to make him look royal & regal, almost drove the proud and handsome equine insane with pain.With his knees damaged from the constant riding and jumping for the sporting events Lady Wexmire's entered him into Black Beauty, along with Ginger, were auctioned off as horses to work for for Hansen Cabs, or taxis, in London. It wasn't easy for Black Beauty to adjust to the hard cobble stone and big city streets after roaming and running on the grass and rolling hills of rural England all his life It's with the love and guidance of his new owner London Cabbie Jerry Barker, David Thewlis, that Beauty did his best and provided Jerry and his family a decent income to live on. Poor Ginger who already had a weak and damaged heart wasn't that lucky dying from the stress of pulling a cab though the London streets. It wasn't long before Jerry himself came down with pneumonia that caused him to give up riding his horse-drawn Hansen Cab and, sadly, his faithful friend Black Beauty as the big bay horse was once again auctioned off, this time to a grain dealer outside of London.Working as a pack-horse pulling wagon-loads of grain from one town to another it took less the a year for Beauty to completely break down and no longer be useful to his new owner, or anyone else, and was just about ready to end up as either glue or pet food. Beauty reached the end of the line with no one wanting the once strikingly handsome but now old lame and broken down back equine.At a horse auction, which looked like curtains for him, Black Beauty spotted Joe who at first didn't recognize him but later when he heard Beauty's distinctive wail knew that he had at last found his long lost friend that Joe so long ago promised he'd never leave or ever forget. Black Beauty was happily bought by the now adult Joe Green and given a place to stay at his farm to live out his last days as happily as his did his early years together with Joe.Sweet and touching movie about friendships between man and animal, as well as man and his fellow man.

Black Beauty was happily bought by the now adult Joe Green and given a place to stay at his farm to live out his last days as happily as his did his early years together with Joe.Sweet and touching movie about friendships between man and animal, as well as man and his fellow man. The movie shows how all creatures on God's good earth both big and small human and animal are all endowed with a God-given heart and soul that when treated with both love kindness and understanding can overcome any obstacle, no matter how big and formidable it is, that's placed before them.

Alfred Hitchcock, the absolute master of suspense, appears to be having a lot of fun with this playful account of the rich and famous in their playground. The film is greatly enhanced by the magnificent photography of Robert Burke whose camera does wonders to show us that beautiful part of France.The film begins with a teasing sequence where one sees a black cat running wildly on the roofs of villas, and later on, hysterical ladies are seen screaming when they realize they have been burglarized. The police links John Robie to the robberies since it appears it's his own modus operandi. In order to fool the authorities that are following him, John boards a bus full of ordinary people bringing things to the market and we catch a glimpse of Hitchcock himself, sitting in the back of the bus, next to John. This is the amazing opening for this film, which shows a lighter Hitchcock, out for a good time.We then meet the rich Stevens, mother and daughter, who are vacationing at the posh Carlton Hotel in Cannes. The insurance agent, Hughson, introduces Robie to them. Hughson wants the Stevens women to be careful with their jewelry; at least, have them keep their gems in the hotel's safe, which they will not hear of. This seems to be an excuse for bringing together John and Frances, a beautiful and elegant woman who makes a point to show how much she hates having even a conversation with Robie, who will display all his charm and ultimately win her over.The best asset in the film is the elegant and ravishing Grace Kelly, at the height of her beauty. Ms. Kelly was one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the screen. In a way, it seems almost as though this film was prophetic in what would happen in her life. First, becoming the fairy tale princess of Monaco, and later on, to die in the same highway one sees her racing her car. Ms. Kelly, dressed by the incomparable Edith Head shows an innate elegance and a great flair to carry clothes in such a wonderful manner.Cary Grant, as John Robie, was at his best portraying the debonair former jewelry thief, a man with a past that had not committed a robbery for many years now, but whose fame preceded him everywhere. Mr. Grant and Ms. Kelly make a great romantic couple whenever we see them. Mr. Hitchcock got a lot out of these two actors and in the process, gives his fan something to care for.John Williams is excellent as the insurance agent trying to protect his clients. Mr. Williams was a superb actor who almost seems not to be acting at all. The same can be said for the chic Jessie Royce Landis, who always showed she was a smart and elegant actress.While this is a film so different from most of his other films, Mr. Hitchcock shows a great affinity for comedy in it. This proved to be a pause in his distinguished career to amuse his public. How well he succeeded!

Following our central protagonist, Mike (Robert DeNiro), effectively the leader of the group, and his journey to, and journey through, the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter manages to immediately connect to the audience, Mike and his friends (Nick, Stan, Axel, John, and Stevie) are you're buddies across the street... the ties you've had since you guys have been together in grade school, these guys are you're friends, the average Joe's, a group, the good-guys. These are closely knit-people who'd help each other through any mess... blood brothers. The journey begins a day or so before Mike, Nick, and Stevie have to go to war, we can see that Mike and Nick (Christopher Walken) are best-buddies within the group. We see that Stevie (John Savage) commits to marriage very hastily, and so on this day before War, we see the major exposition the wedding.The wedding is the center-point of the Russian Community in this small neighborhood, it is a hello to the union of two, and at the same time, a farewell to those heading off to war. It's a way for everyone to gather and celebrate, and it manages to show the relationships of characters. Stan (John Cazale) is the sleezy guy who gets a woman every night, Axel (Chuck Aspegren) is a big-friendly bear type, John (George Dzundza) is a man of celebration, Nick is the best friend of everyone, and Mike seems and feels out of place. He doesn't want or like large crowds, he doesn't want to be part of something bigger, he'd rather sit back and think, he's the lone-wolf. He places his eyes on Nick's Girl, Linda (Meryl Streep) but knows he cannot have her.The next day is the Deer Hunt, a moment where the group can be alone, have one last personal goodbye, as oppose to the community one with the wedding. The Deer Hunt seems to be a weekend ritual for the group, it's a pass-time they collectively enjoy, without distractions from others. They are truly together, camaraderie.Vietnam is another test of camaraderie but that venturing into dangerous territory. (Spoilerville) Cinematography was stellar especially in the Deer Hunt scenes, and at Welch's Bar, where the atmosphere was friendly, (Think Cheers), and the treacherous Vietnam, a place filled with warfare and sin.Sound was excellent, and especially invoked feeling in the viewer, watching the cast sing together (camaraderie) and watching the wedding singer sing to the crowd. Listening to the classical guitar during the intimate moments.Overall The Deer Hunter is an amazing film of the 70's, a dramatic movie that connects to it's audience through the friendship of characters, through love, through loss, through life. You will laugh and you will cry, you will experience all the up's and down's of these characters' lives.10\/10 - WATCH IT!

While the characters and plot are not as well drawn, the action and atmosphere are as good, and there's a certain Indiana Jones element added with the addition of some outdoor action sequences. Director Renny Harlin hit a career high with this one (and has directed a lot of duds since), and deserves a lot of credit for the film working as well as it does. As much as this shouldn't have worked, it's so much fun that the logic doesn't matter - and far more enjoyable than it's successor, Die Hard With a Vengeance, which tries to do something new but doesn't capture the excitement or suspense of authentic Die Hard.

While the characters and plot are not as well drawn, the action and atmosphere are as good, and there's a certain Indiana Jones element added with the addition of some outdoor action sequences. Director Renny Harlin hit a career high with this one (and has directed a lot of duds since), and deserves a lot of credit for the film working as well as it does. As much as this shouldn't have worked, it's so much fun that the logic doesn't matter - and far more enjoyable than it's successor, Die Hard With a Vengeance, which tries to do something new but doesn't capture the excitement or suspense of authentic Die Hard.
