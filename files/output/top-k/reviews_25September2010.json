My question is how long are they at sea for a set? Linda asks Billy, Are you going again this season? It doesn't sound like this is a monthly gig and I am curious if Sword fishing is even possible in the winter.

It had potential, as Roger Spottiswoode looked set for good things, but a lot of things range from pretty bad to terrible. The film goes at a good pace and is quite short. However, the film looks rather slapdash and is just really unfunny, apart from the part with Stallone in the diaper. This is not helped by the lacking direction, the predictable story and the truly dire script that does nothing whatsoever for the actors. The acting, to be honest... it wasn't good at all. Sylvester Stallone is okay here, he does look embarrassed and tired but he does look as though he is trying. However, his material is awful and he struggles with it. As for the debate of whether Sly can do comedy, this and Rhinestone are for me misfires but Oscar is very underrated and Sly is actually funny in that, so if I say he wasn't as funny as he should've been, I blame the script. Estelle Getty is a lot worse though, I like her, but her character is well and truly irritating and Getty herself grates and wears out her welcome early on. In conclusion, pretty awful, not only one of Sly's worst films but one of the worst comedies conceived or so I think. 1\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"25 September 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Please, I really tried to like this film, but it didn't work for me.
