The Beatles were gone and the Rolling Stones were laid up in mansions somewhere. Yes - this was the B Leaguers big moment, if only they had know it.The band in the movie are like the Allman Brothers meets Free meets Crosby, Stills and Nash. We don't hear a lot of their music (which is surprising) so a lot of that description it is based on haircuts and attitude. Drink and drugs are introduced early and without preaching, but doesn't seem to effect the band's performance.The soundtrack album seems to be important and features tracks of the time (some a little after!) that don't get played too often on the radio. If you think they are weak - and plenty is rock and pop dirge - well that supports what I said about the times.How clever of writer\/director to use a child as our guide. Not a hip and cool one either. A nerdy - but bright - kid (Patrick Fugit) who loves music and already writes about it for underground mags.(What did Lou Reed say about music journalists? People that cannot write, writing for people that cannot read.

That the drugged up shouldn't take any more (hey, we have all been there or been on the end of that speech). That peeing infront of people is not polite.One problem with this movie is that plenty of gags are private references (David Crosby was reputed to have the best dope, hence I know this good stuff because Crosby gave it to me.) and how many young audience members knows that Peggy Sue was a Buddy Holly song? Or even how he died?All such movies have to avoid being Spinal Tap nowadays and we are getting close in the Aeroplane, T-shirt and this is the man from the record company scenes; but all have the ring of truth.Fugit gets laid (by the groupies - who else!) and we are supposed to be pleased for him. Why? They are sleeping with everyone and we don't see any use of condoms - so how do we know he is not catching a dose? Would we have been pleased if the band had underage sex with a girl?In case you are worried, drugs are shown as not all of a good thing - but I'll not spoil it for those that haven't seen the film.Sadly this is just a superior made-for-TV movie that would collapse if it were not for the youthful sheen of Fugit and careful period detail.

Its about a mafia enforcer Mike Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who goes on the run with his surviving son after the people he works for, kills off his family. The film follows us thru to how about he plans to dish out revenge and his relationship with his son on the road. It did good to show the natural inquisitiveness of a young boy and to justify the way things went. Tom Hanks does superbly in portraying Michael Sullivan, i was skeptical that he would be able to pull it off but he did it and it has cemented for me that hes a fantastic actor who can play any role he wants. His kid in the film also does a great job. Paul Newman was suberb in it also, bringing to the film his years of honed experience into this film, and those eyes. The film has a nice Irish\/mafia theme to it and brings all the trimmings. Jude Law does good to portray a evil quirky bounty hunter.

The Cinematography was fantastic, many times i was stunned by the scenes, particulary the sea ending.

I'll say this, the movie is a little twisted but the acting was anything but ordinary.Robin Wright Penn plays off her character, Maureen and her real life husband so well that it effects her performance of a mobster's poor girlfriend.James Gandolfini is great as a sleazy, creepy neighbour Kiefer, another great portrayal from James even though he isn't that big of a character. He's done so many different films but it always seems to be him who sparks up the film. He was great as the father in The Mighty he was fantastic as the gay hitman the disappointing The Mexican, as the tough Bear in Get Shorty and i'm sure he's going to be magnificant in the next Coens movie \/ musical. He never seizes to amaze me.But the real gem here is Sean Penn as mobster Eddie. I know he won Best Actor at a festival, to which i'm not so sure but he shines in this movie. His love for Maureen is really sweet as he'd do anything for her, whatever it takes. There's this one scene with Sean and Robin where Sean displays some incredible acting ability. I haven't seen I Am Sam yet but i heard that it isn't that great of a movie but he must have done something right to earn an Oscar Nomination.

Too bad  \/No, it's not that I regret watching this one. 4 me it lasted 30 minutes anyway.. By that moment I suddenly started feeling like I had enough. Hey, did anyone mention James Bond? What I actually liked about Vin Diesel (don't get me wrong, please) was his neck. It (his neck) had style. The rest.. is up to you.The stunt with the Chevy was disappointing. What p****d me off most, was that they've been showing it 4 so long, as if it was a masterpiece of action, like ANY of James Bond intros. But please..I do, however, have respect 4 those fellas, who did the motorcycle stuff (it wasn't Vin Diesel himself, I presume). The pieces were great, but the stunts never make a movie - rather it's a good movie, that shines even brighter with some STUNning gems in it. And this one is dim (I maybe would have said more, but I didn't watch the rest and went to see 'Minority Report' instead. A decision I did not regret ;)PS 1 I'm only sorry 4 Samuel L. Jackson. He's a great actor, no doubt. But sometimes everyone has to sacrifice something. I only hope they payed him well 4 this.PS 2 Pierce Brosnan will maybe make one more, but than he retires.. Maybe, Vin Diesel could.. eh..?

That could be because he has to pay off his father-in-law's debt, and his wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), makes sure that he pays it (his father-in-law and he worked together). Sophie sounds a lot like Yvette from Clue. Oz is unhappily married, and wants to divorce Sophie ASAP. After meeting Jimmy The Tulip Tudeski (Bruce Willis), Sophie thinks of a way to get out of debt.Jimmy was a contract killer who just spent five years in prison. So Sophie makes Oz go to Chicago and find the son of a mob boss that Jimmy killed to rat Jimmy out so that he can get money for a finder's fee. And that's just the first reel.The movie feels like a drama where the actors don't think that they're funny, but they are. As director Lynn said on the commentary on the DVD, You could make it a drama and not take out any words. But, it's a comedy, and Perry adds some physical humor to the otherwise wordy humor.Willis plays great in these type of roles-the comedic bad guys, the part where he can be funny but is also in a serious role. I liked him in this role; and so did he.My favorite character was Jill St. Clair, played by Amanda Peet. She was good as Oz's secretary who falls in love with Jimmy. It's obvious she wasn't that comfortable with her nude scene, but she managed to get through it, and I hope she's as good in the sequel.Michael Clarke Duncan played Frankie Figs, someone who supposedly works for Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), the son I mentioned earlier. He came on to work right after he finished with The Green Mile, and his roles couldn't be any more different. He shows his big-ness in here too, and it's worth seeing TWNY just to see Perry run into him.The only thing I didn't like about the movie was it wasn't always funny. I thought that the plot had a few too many twists and turns for a comedy, but it could be a new style. But, I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind paying attention in movies, because if you don't pay attention, you'll get lost.My rating 6\/10Rated R for nudity.

He has a great ability to act alongside any actress as in Grosse Pointe Blank and America's Sweethearts.  His connection through fate with Kate Beckinsale made me think that maybe there's hope for me yet.  Maybe it's just wishful thinking but I would love it if someone like Beckinsale came into my life through fate.  She seems to have the ideal combination of pretty, funny, and smart.  Too bad she's famous!  Jeremy Piven, as with in Grosse Pointe Blank, makes the ideal best friend.  It is tough to decide whether he has the funniest lines or if Eugene Levy does.  The other two female leads work well also.  Even though I don't particularly like Molly Shannon (think Superstar) She is funny in this movie.  Bridget Moynahan was a great pick to play John's fiance, because she would have been a good partner for his character if not for fates introduction of the two leads. She also showed a great range against the previous character of the tough bitch in Coyote Ugly (I liked her that way).  The only character that I didn't particularly like was John Corbett's character.  I don't think he was supposed to be completely, but he seemed self centered instead of being somewhat likeable.  The ending was definitely obvious, but it would have been disappointing otherwise.  But the path was a great ride.  It would have been better with someone to watch it with.
