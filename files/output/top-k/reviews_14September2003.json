Although the baby, named Damien, appears to be a normal, healthy child he seems to be the centre of many strange and grisly occurrences including the death of a Priest who previously warned Robert about Damien. Robert tries to reason the situation but is finally convinced when confronted by photographer Jennings (David Warner) who has pictures with some shocking indications of the truth on them. Like the other great religious horror of the 1970's, &#145;The Exorcist', this movie incorporates a supposedly innocent child as a symbol of evil and succeeds almost faultlessly. A superb performance by Gregory Peck is the highlight of this movie which also features a solid storyline, a strong supporting cast (including Lee Remick) and exceptional direction from Richard Donner who makes this a shining example of how to create a slick and highly enjoyable horror\/thriller. The story moves at exactly the right pace and although while watching the movie some may think it will continue forever, &#145;The Omen' remains entertaining and gripping throughout. What I really loved about &#145;The Omen' is how the story was based perfectly around actual Christian beliefs about the antichrist. Rather than make up the rules as it went along like so many other religious or demon based movies &#145;The Omen' stayed very close to the genuine prophecies that it seeks to portray which adds to the effect for those who have studied religion, at least that is what I would presume. &#145;The Omen' is much less graphic than &#145;The Exorcist' but is still shocking on many levels. &#145;The Omen' is more of a psychological horror than 'The Exorcist' (which itself succeeded in creating terror on a psychological level) which works by instructing the viewer that certain events will happen but leaving the viewer in a state of uncertainty as to whether they will happen. Although &#145;The Omen' has some rather grisly scenes the gore never distracts from the story and instead compliments the film beautifully. &#145;The Omen' is not afraid to break all the conventional horror movie rules about survival and timing so the shock-factor is increased for certain scenes while it becomes hard to tell how this film could possibly end? There we have another awe-inspiring part of the film &#150; the end. Gripping and intense! The final ten minutes offer one of the most powerful performances in a horror movie as well as some outstanding scripting and direction which allowed the scenes to build up and leave the viewer with a chilling closing image. Often imitated but never rivalled &#145;The Omen' is one of the 1970's best movies which paved the way for the big-budget flicks of the 80's such as &#145;Poltergeist'. Phenomenally successful at the time it seems strange that this movie has not really achieved the cult status of many lesser-films and though retaining some popularity is often neglected when talking about the great movies of horror. For those people who enjoy well acted, shocking, slick and highly artistic movies or religious-horror I heartily recommend this movie. I certainly believe this is a must-see for horror fans.

One of the best suspense\/slasher flix ever made.Jamie Lee Curtis, daughter of veteran actress Janet Leigh and actor Tony Curtis (Bernard Schwartz), was a twenty-year old, unseasoned actress with only a two episodes of Operation Petticoat and a bit part in a Colombo movie under her belt when she was cast in this, her first leading role. (As usual, 20 year olds playing high schoolers) While her acting is still a trifle fresh, she convincingly portrays her role as well as she would today, as a seasoned actress. She makes you smile, and later, makes you scream, squirm up into your chair and pull the blanket up to your chin.Laurie and her friends comprise a small group of teen-aged girls who baby sit for weed money, and spend most of their time like many teen aged girls do; screwing their boyfriends and otherwise scheming on how to get out of the house in order to perpetrate their other plans...screwing their boyfriends. I won't outline the plot here, as this movie was done in 1978, but I will say that Donald Pleasence is very convincing as the psychiatrist, Dr. Samuel Loomis, who first treats Michael Audrey Myers. He seems genuinely concerned that he is loose and makes you believe that he cares. As he outlines Michael's past history with the cop, you get all the information you need in order to just sit back, follow the movie and enjoy being scared out of your wits.While the overuse of the word totally is somewhat annoying, it's classic late '70's, early '80's jargon which Nancy Kyes (Annie) can't seem to do without. She's good and believable as a complete and total air head you can't wait to see butchered. She's also done The Fog (John Carpenter, 1980), Halloween 2, Halloween 3 (a movie they could have just never made), Not in Front of the Children and Lady Boss...nothing really spectacular, but she's entertaining in this.Wide screen had newly been introduced when Carpenter made this movie, and he excels in its use. View the wide screen edition of this movie to catch all the side action you missed in the full screen version. I understand it exhibits his abilities to give us excellent filmography and cinematography.What's also excellent is Jamie Lee Curtis's ability to exude tension, fright, concern, happiness and horror all within the same scene. She really spreads her wings in this movie and exhibits those traits we've now come to expect from her.Also I must comment on the story line\/plot. I wasn't going to, but I simply must. I typically dislike slasher flicks...mindless killing, puerile acting, hollow and empty plots...but the Halloween movies aren't like that. They definitely give us something besides mindless entertainment.As you may know, the endings of these movies are never really endings. They always come back.

","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"14 September 2003","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Introducing Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode. Wonderful. One of the best suspense\/slasher flix ever made.Jamie Lee Curtis, daughter of veteran actress Janet Leigh and actor Tony Curtis (Bernard Schwartz), was a twenty-year old, unseasoned actress with only a two episodes of Operation Petticoat and a bit part in a Colombo movie under her belt when she was cast in this, her first leading role. (As usual, 20 year olds playing high schoolers) While her acting is still a trifle fresh, she convincingly portrays her role as well as she would today, as a seasoned actress. She makes you smile, and later, makes you scream, squirm up into your chair and pull the blanket up to your chin.Laurie and her friends comprise a small group of teen-aged girls who baby sit for weed money, and spend most of their time like many teen aged girls do; screwing their boyfriends and otherwise scheming on how to get out of the house in order to perpetrate their other plans...screwing their boyfriends. I won't outline the plot here, as this movie was done in 1978, but I will say that Donald Pleasence is very convincing as the psychiatrist, Dr. Samuel Loomis, who first treats Michael Audrey Myers. He seems genuinely concerned that he is loose and makes you believe that he cares. As he outlines Michael's past history with the cop, you get all the information you need in order to just sit back, follow the movie and enjoy being scared out of your wits.While the overuse of the word totally is somewhat annoying, it's classic late '70's, early '80's jargon which Nancy Kyes (Annie) can't seem to do without. She's good and believable as a complete and total air head you can't wait to see butchered. She's also done The Fog (John Carpenter, 1980), Halloween 2, Halloween 3 (a movie they could have just never made), Not in Front of the Children and Lady Boss...nothing really spectacular, but she's entertaining in this.Wide screen had newly been introduced when Carpenter made this movie, and he excels in its use. View the wide screen edition of this movie to catch all the side action you missed in the full screen version. I understand it exhibits his abilities to give us excellent filmography and cinematography.What's also excellent is Jamie Lee Curtis's ability to exude tension, fright, concern, happiness and horror all within the same scene. She really spreads her wings in this movie and exhibits those traits we've now come to expect from her.Also I must comment on the story line\/plot. I wasn't going to, but I simply must. I typically dislike slasher flicks...mindless killing, puerile acting, hollow and empty plots...but the Halloween movies aren't like that. They definitely give us something besides mindless entertainment.As you may know, the endings of these movies are never really endings. They always come back. The ending of Halloween 1 is a classic in the field of Horror. Jamie is so natural here. I love this movie. It's one of my favorite horror flix.It gets a solid 9.2\/10 from...the Fiend .

This horrid piece of cinematic garbage is the absolute worst pile of crap ever caught on camera.  Every aspect of this worthless piece of filth is awful beyond all description.

Not only that, but he is miscasted and underplayed.How could anyone get this story so wrong?!?  The acting is wretched.  The cinematography is bland and uninteresting.  The special effects are cheesy, thrown together, and annoying.  Whoever made the soundtrack was obviously trying to put the audience to sleep.  The lighting is dull and the costumes and makeup are stupid.  There is not a single thing that is good about this movie.  I got up in the middle of it and went to watch my little brother play computer games because it interested me more than watching this pathetic excuse of a movie.

First, it's not the typical linear beginning to end film.  And the plot cannot be picked up in the first five minutes.  It sheds light on a society that we see everyday but tend to stray away from, or possibly even overlook.  It deals with a dysfunctional family and the encounters of a brave Julien, played by Ewen Bremner (Snatch, Trainspotting).  He portrays a young man dealing with schizophrenia in an upbeat urban town, pretty much based on Harmony's real life uncle Eddy.  You experience and discover what it is like existing in a world that might not totally make much sense.  You meet his loving and caring sister, played by Chloe Sevigny, starring yet again in another Korine story.  She is forced to play the role of sister and mother to a fragile Julien.    You hit the streets with Julien and encounter a very powerful cast of strangers.  Of them are a very talented armless man, an African American albino, and quite a few more people with minor physical and mental handicaps.  As most people would feel sorry for these individuals, I tend to go another route.  You see the strength and ability of all these characters.  Juleins favorite places to frequent are a local bowling alley, a southern pentecostal church, and the skating rink.  He goes to these places to appear normal and fit in with society.  But his family life is quite a different story.  You see the environment in this household that is filled with many points of culture, but very distorted and unorthodox.  A household that is filled with music, morals, fashion, but mostly the absence of a mother\/wife figure.  The whole of the family is forced to cut their losses and move on with life the only way they know how.  Depending on each other to fill the void.  The camera work is very non-traditional and covers many different formats.  Yet again, another element that would shake the average viewer.  I give this film 4\/5 for its honesty, artistic value, and how much you really identify with the characters.  If you are into cinema that doesn't take you from point A to point B, I highly recommend this film.  Full of wonderful performances and true to life characters.  Favorite parts for me armless man's drum solo, the skating rink scenes, and all the solo Julien scenes.  This film taught me that there is two sides to everything and a curse for one might be a blessing for another.  But mostly how we all survive obstacles in life, despite the hand we have been dealt.  This film is closer to a documentary than that of a fictional story.  I have never seen a Harmony Korine production that I didn't like.

I've done some research considering its status in the rest of the world and it seems that the series didn't broke through anywhere. Then came the movie in 1990 which was a pleasant surprise. I really hope the status of the TV-series didn't spoil the (possible) success of the movie.Tales from the Dark Side The movie illuminates 3 very interesting horror icons. We've got a mummy, a black cat and a Gargoyle...you can never go wrong with those 3. Heck, throw in a werewolf and we've got ourself a horror party !!!  This film follows the old-fashioned way of combining short stories. This means through a wraparound story. True, this thing is very dumb and childish but try to consider it to be a modern version of the fairy-tale in which a wicked witch eats a boy. I rather hear Blondie singing her classic 80's songs like Atomic then seeing her act, but that's just me. Then there are the stories. The first one, Lot 249, is awesome !!! It's got STEVE BUSCEMI and a freakin' MUMMY !! What else could you possibly wish for??... Several familiar faces in this story by the way. Christian Slater and Julliane Moore star as well.
