It was the film that made me realise that I was a fan of Cameron's work, however I was deeply surprised to find that the film is not regarded as the classic it so rightly is.What Cameron has done is to create a science fiction thriller that is epic on every level. The story, especially in the director's cut, is one that goes beyond being a bottom of the ocean\/alien film, it becomes a deep message for why we should try to live in peace and how we should respect each other as a race (maybe George W Bush should be made to watch the film, maybe he might learn something), but amazingly, amongst all the superb visual effects (the birth of CGI) and fantastic underwater cinematography, Cameron creates characters that we come to care deeply about. He doesn't forget that for something epic to be truly moving, he needs to have three dimensional characters that we want to see alive at the very end and here he has more than succeeded. Giving us a love story (of sorts) before Titanic was even a possibility, he creates an estranged relationship in Bud and Lindsey's faltering marriage and makes us hope for a Hollywood happy ending, one we thankfully get.The supporting cast and characters are also fantastic here. Hippy, Jammer, Catfish, One Night and Coffey also get a chance to be fleshed out and all have their moments and even though he is, essentially, the villain of the film, Cameron even makes one feel sympathy for Coffey is that nightmarish final moment he has as he faces death.I love the film and I make no apologies for it. There are many who have problems with the film, I know, but I just have a soft spot for any film that Cameron makes. His mixture of fantastic and ground breaking visual effects and his talent as one of the best storytellers in the movie business today always combine to give us a journey we never forget and with The Abyss all those abilities come to the surface (pun unintended, I swear). Even better is the Director's Cut of the film that gives Cameron a chance to flesh his story even more making the film one that is epic and which gives us a message that, while some may find preachy, in today's day and age is highly relevant.Fantastic in every regard.

And it slyly slips in ideas and images from other sources, to good effect Krank himself is as much of the mad-doctor stereotype as is the character in The Nightmare Before Christmas; his outlandish electro-headgear is similar to that used in Disney's Merlin Jones; a nightmare on the loose swoops low along the ground through streets and alleys as a trail of green mist, improving on a similar image from Bram Stoker's Dracula; there's a confrontation in dreamland a la the Elm Street series; and while the idea of a brain in a tank isn't a new one, this is the first benign one I've ever seen.  Familiar or not--and I'm thinking also of The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T--City of Lost Children is still engaging, enjoyably weird, fantastic and funny, helped greatly by the fact that One and Miette are so endearing.

Despite some extra gadgets and gook, it was simply your classic `it was all a dream&#133; or was it' twist. It is a smart surprise and answers a few questions, but giving that the entire film was leading up to this moment is a bit disappointing. At only 97 minutes it could have went on a bit longer too.

The result is good in parts, bad in parts, and just plain weird in others. But one thing the film has is undeniable originality. Despite the excessive use of&#133; weirdness it does prove a point- virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people. In the movie, a character shoots someone dead claiming that he was `annoying' (assuming that she was still in the game). But it leaves the question as to whether that really happened or if it was an occurrence in this stunningly life-like game. `eXistenZ' leads to a conclusion that can be responded to in several ways. Despite some extra gadgets and gook, it was simply your classic `it was all a dream&#133; or was it' twist. It is a smart surprise and answers a few questions, but giving that the entire film was leading up to this moment is a bit disappointing. At only 97 minutes it could have went on a bit longer too. In a peculiar way the film raises moral issues but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way. Jennifer Jason Leigh appears here in her first big role in quite a while. But her character doesn't have enough qualities to make her jump off the screen or even give her a likeable character. Jude Law on the other hand (equipped with a curious American accent) is good as your average Joe sucked into this abnormal world. We see the film through his perspective.`eXistenZ' is far from flawless but it certainly is a movie experience to remember. There's tonnes of weird characteristics to match the similar styles of David Lynch (what next? - being consumed by a question mark?!?!?!). It definitely isn't for all tastes but it is rewarding enough to recommend. My IMDb rating 6.2\/10.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"16 May 2003","score":"30 out of 37 people found the following review useful","review":" This one, unlike many of Woody's pieces over the past decade or so, is neither a failed comedy nor a dullish drama. It's pretty funny all the way through and lacks any pretense of being otherwise. I won't go into the story except to repeat that Woody is a film director here, given a last chance, trying to direct a remake of a 1940s film. He suddenly suffers from hysterical blindness and must make the movie without seeing any of the performances, the rushes, the production design, the promotional material, or anything else. His agent is the only one in on the secret. They enlist the help of a Chinese translator to act as Woody's guide around the set and the rest of the world, but the translator is fired by the Chinese cameraman. So the agent must spill the beans to Woody's separated wife who then acts as her husband's eyes. It all ends happily. This is a consistently amusing movie. There is even the occasional pratfall that hasn't been seen in a Woody movie for a long time. There are, to be sure, serious undertones that surface from time to time, but they lie lightly on the narrative line. One of these is the still-fuzzy relationship between Woody and his separated wife, Tia Leoni, who is engaged now to Treat Williams, grown bulky and authoritative. The other theme deals with Woody's relationship with his son, Tony. Tony has joined a rock band, if that's the term. His hair is a sickly dark green piled up in an improbable sculpture atop his head, like a Yurok Indian's. He eat rats on stage and has changed his name from Tony Waxman to ScumbagX. Tony once threw his father down a flight of stairs. But, That was then, says Tony, easily forgiving himself, and it was stupid. Tony doesn't have the funniest lines in the movie but in one way he gives the most interesting performance in the movie, because he's just about the only actor (not including the two Chinese) who doesn't speak the way Woody does. The nervous mannerisms we've come to recognize are all here in everyone else, and they're funny too, because they fit the characters so well. (They were appropriate to his character in Broadway Danny Rose, too. And as they weren't when Branaugh used them in Celebrity.) Here, just about everybody's got them. Hardly a sentence is completed with someone else interrupting or the sentence itself wandering off into space, lost, having forgotten its own beginning. I didn't bother to do a content analysis of the dialog but if y'know? isn't the most common utterance I'd be kind of surprised. Stuttering is endemic to the cast. People ask, Whaddaya mean? And somebody replies, Whaddaya mean, whaddo I mean? Hands flutter as if with lives of their own. The blind Woody praises a promotional poster for the film while admiring its blank back. He himself is older here, noticeably, but not depressingly. His hair is now gray and his bald patch more pronounced. But he's in good shape and his wit is keen. He plays the blind man in a hilariously exaggerated fashion -- never looking directly at the person he's conversing with, constantly holding his open palms up in front of his chest as if carrying an invisible pumpkin. A writer from Esquire tells him fawningly how much she's enjoyed his work while taking notes for a tell-all scandalous hatchet-job about everyone involved in the production, kind of like the number Lillian Ross did on Hemingway for the New Yorker profile or on Huston's Red Badge of Courage. Unluckily, she wears the same perfume as his wife and, thinking he's talking with Leoni, Allen tells her everything. And it isn't as if the whole film depends on the odd one-liner, although those one-liners are there too. (After regaining his sight, Woody views for the first time the footage he's shot, and he looks stricken. Call Doctor Kavorkian, he says slowly.) The premise is absurd, of course. No one could pass himself off as sighted under these conditions. But joke follows joke unerringly, sometimes building on one another. Before an important meeting with the film's producer, his wife takes him to the guy's apartment to familiarize him with the layout. This way, you see, he will know where the chair is located, the desk, and the other items of furniture. She tries to be as helpful as possible. While he's wringing his hands in the doorway, she paces off distances in the apartment, telling him, Okay, now you enter through the door and walk four steps. Then the chair is on your right. But, okay, if Hal is sitting there, you'll take two more steps. Now you turn to the left because that's where the sofa is, but watch out for the lamp. Woody anxiously repeats her instructions -- watch out for the lamp, and the sofa is, two more paces, no four -- okay -- and then turn left. The instructions become impossibly complicated and confusing and Woody is gripping his head trying to remember them, until everything begins to break down, including the editing, and we get sequences that might have come out of that movie in which Danny Kaye has to remember that the poison is in the pellet of the picture of the peacock and the flagon with the dragon has the brew that is true. Meanwhile Woody is stumbling around with those forearms stretched before him and a blank gaze, one of Baron von Frankenstein's rejects. During the actual interview he manages to sit on the lamp. You really ought to see this one if you are in the mood for laughs because it's a thoroughly successful comedy.

Of course one of the main problems that effects these blockbuster hits is that it may overload on special effects and be very poor in the script and dialogue. `Minority Report' avoids this problem with delightful relish. Of course the visuals are mesmerising as expected, but the plot holds your attention and the dialogue is never clunky, wooden or unconvincing. Another thing that the film has in spades is imagination. It tries to show a well-detailed portrait of a gloomy utopian future. You can see that a lot of work went into the script and the imagination is simply oozing out of its sides. But it has a minor deficiency of one thing- heart. While there is plenty of genuine grievances with Tom Cruise's character and his wife, the rest of the cast doesn't seem to have that many emotional reactions. However, there's still more heart present than in similarly themed big-budget outings. Besides, the body is big enough to carry the brains around. `Minority Report' is divided into three different parts, each a different branch of the sci-fi genre. It starts off as a futuristic noir with a cool plot, in which cops must race against time to prevent crimes. The second part is rather like `The Fugitive' with the classic man-on-the-run scenario. But there's the extra-added twist that keeps us on the edge of the seat- he kills someone in 48 hours who he's never heard of&#133; or does he?

It managed to do something that few 'horror' films do - audiences were enraptured and critics applauded. Well done. The film was original in its approach and atmosphere was quickly projected. Unfortunately this seems to be all the film has going for it.Spoilers herein.Centering on three young people making a documentary about a local myth in order, it seems, to find out whether there is any truth in it, the film follows the protagonists into woods around which the 'Blair Witch' myth centres. They hear noises in the night, see some blobs of light and get lost in the woods. Soon, they begin to become agitated with one another sporadically, and tensions rise within the group. One of them disappears and leaves his teeth behind. The pair left behind worry for their friend and follow his voice to an empty house where they get killed. Boo-hoo.My summary may be only skeletal, and biased by my distaste for the film, but it gives one an idea of how inherently awful the plot is. Of course, plot is not everything, as so many have proved before, but unfortunately the film also suffers from a terrible script. The characters, while not suffering from one-dimensionalism, fail to convince because they seem so utterly motiveless in everything they do or say. There is some improvisation, which utterly fails to convince due to the chronically opaque acting during the second half of the movie. Development seems totally absent. The closest thing is the repetitive structure of increasingly emotionally tense days followed by increasingly noise-filled nights. Unfortunately this is all that happens. The emotion merely increases and the noises merely get louder.Much of the 'footage' at night is punctuated by long moments in which the viewer merely sees a blank screen and listens to some heavy breathing (and wonders why they were foolish enough to PAY for the privilege). When finally, the plot moves along somewhat, it is exceptionally dull. The characters supposedly begin to 'lose it' and become feral enough to begin running around screaming, jerking around their camcorder just a little bit more than necessary. They enter a house, scream some more and lose sight of each other before dying.But, alas, I have explained why the bad constituents are so awful far enough, I hope. Now I should perhaps state why the good parts don't work. Firstly, the film's original approach. The pretense that the film is 'footage' left behind serves to allow the camera to be extremely subjective. One would surmise that this would draw the viewer in to the picture, but it in fact alienates the viewer due to the camera's own self-consciousness. Presumably this is because the actor's apparently filmed much of the footage themselves (or so I am told). Whether the directors wished to alienate the viewer intentionally I don't know, but it does not work with the hyper-personal nature of the film.Secondly, the films evocation of atmosphere. This is the one thing that the film does very well. Very quickly the viewer's mind is filled with ideas of witchcraft, the supernatural etc. The power of the horror genre lies in its ability to take one's fears and twist them into something worse inside your head. This film doesn't do that. It merely continues those fears' natural proliferation in a boring manner.I will not recommend another film, but rather suggest that you think about the supernatural, or demons, or whatever, and then go and sit in the living room late at night with the lights off. It will be a wholly more interesting experience.2 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 May 2003","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  'The Blair Witch Project' was one of THE film phenomena of 1999.

Probably the best movie he was featured in was Bonnie and Clyde, but his incredible filmography includes The French Connection, Superman, The Quick and the Dead, and dozens of other highly entertaining films. While he has earned a lot of recognition in recent years for The Royal Tennenbaums and Unforgiven, I would actually argue that his two greatest acting performances, and his two greatest star vehicles, are in movies that are laregly unknown or underrated. The first of these films is French Connection II (which, thanks to the Cold Turkey segment, and the wonderful fish-out-of-water storyline, I would consider superior to the original) and this film, Under Suspicion.Like 12 Angry Men, Under Suspicion is largely confined to one location - an interrogation room - and, because of the confined setting, it could arguably be called a filmed play rather than a movie. And yet, the film has a lot of flashback segments and bridge segments that take the action out of the interrogation room, so it is actually a less claustrophobic film than 12 Angry Men, if not *quite* as good a film. (12 Angry Men is probably one of the top 5 movies I've ever seen.)While the subject matter is very, very unpleasant (Hackman is accused of raping and murdering young girls on the cusp of adolescence), the film is gripping, and one finds oneself really involved trying to determine Hackman's guilt or innocence.  Since there are so few characters interacting in a confined space, we get to know a lot about the personalities and histories of the interrogators and the witnesses, and Hackman and Freeman do some of their best acting work.  Monica Bellucci is gorgeous and compelling, and I am glad she is at long last catipulting to fame thanks to the Matrix films. Thomas Jane gives a solid performance that works as an audition for his upcoming role as the Punisher.Without offering any spoilers, I must complain about the other reviews posted on imdb and amazon.com about this movie.  Despite the stellar cast, I almost did not rent the film because a number of reviewers called the ending confusing, inappropriate, or just plain bad.  Not only are these reviews false ... they are VERY false. The ending is shocking and marvelous, and really challenged me to re-examine my view of the criminal justice system. It is a tremendous ending, if you take the time to think it through.I'm glad that this film has started popping up in $9 bins at Best Buy. I'm hoping that this means that the film will get greater exposure and garner some of the attention it so richly deserves. And I hope that the same thing happens for The Edge, which I also spotted in the $9 bin at Best Buy last week, too.

It is a tremendous ending, if you take the time to think it through.I'm glad that this film has started popping up in $9 bins at Best Buy. I'm hoping that this means that the film will get greater exposure and garner some of the attention it so richly deserves. And I hope that the same thing happens for The Edge, which I also spotted in the $9 bin at Best Buy last week, too. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"16 May 2003","score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  Gene Hackman has been in a number of really superb films, many of which are regarded as classics. Probably the best movie he was featured in was Bonnie and Clyde, but his incredible filmography includes The French Connection, Superman, The Quick and the Dead, and dozens of other highly entertaining films. While he has earned a lot of recognition in recent years for The Royal Tennenbaums and Unforgiven, I would actually argue that his two greatest acting performances, and his two greatest star vehicles, are in movies that are laregly unknown or underrated. The first of these films is French Connection II (which, thanks to the Cold Turkey segment, and the wonderful fish-out-of-water storyline, I would consider superior to the original) and this film, Under Suspicion.Like 12 Angry Men, Under Suspicion is largely confined to one location - an interrogation room - and, because of the confined setting, it could arguably be called a filmed play rather than a movie. And yet, the film has a lot of flashback segments and bridge segments that take the action out of the interrogation room, so it is actually a less claustrophobic film than 12 Angry Men, if not *quite* as good a film. (12 Angry Men is probably one of the top 5 movies I've ever seen.)While the subject matter is very, very unpleasant (Hackman is accused of raping and murdering young girls on the cusp of adolescence), the film is gripping, and one finds oneself really involved trying to determine Hackman's guilt or innocence.  Since there are so few characters interacting in a confined space, we get to know a lot about the personalities and histories of the interrogators and the witnesses, and Hackman and Freeman do some of their best acting work.  Monica Bellucci is gorgeous and compelling, and I am glad she is at long last catipulting to fame thanks to the Matrix films. Thomas Jane gives a solid performance that works as an audition for his upcoming role as the Punisher.Without offering any spoilers, I must complain about the other reviews posted on imdb and amazon.com about this movie.

But when you take away all of these layers of corny dialogue, you're left with your average cliché drenched `boy meets girl' fable. And `City of Angels' doesn't go far beyond that to make it anything spectacular. Either way, the film isn't much to recommend. While there are a few neat touches, there's also an unsettling sadistic edge to the movie. It seems more determined to go for heavy tragedy instead of pure entertainment.Perhaps it would have been better had it taken itself less seriously. The plot isn't something that you could easily believe, and maybe some light-heartiness or genuine wit would have livened things up a bit. On its own level of indecisive drama it is so-so at best. The constant reliance on a soundtrack of songs for emotional power is a turn-off. There's also plenty of plot holes that it doesn't even attempt to avoid. For example, if angels can't be seen, how come Seth (the angel) is noticed by almost every character he comes in contact with.As film couples go, Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan have that rare `easy on the eye' quality that make them a believable pair. Cage is quite good as the sympathetic angel, but doesn't have good dialogue to work with. On the other hand, Meg Ryan's performance is flawed. A performance of this calibre requires more oomph to persuade us that this is a character worth sympathising for. She looks the part but works better with lighter material. We don't get much of a chance to care for the characters though, as the plot's self-destructive motion takes over (big mistake).While it ends on a (kind of) happy note, what went before was not worth the two-hour wait. With A grade Hollywood Stars in the leading roles, the finished product should have been much better than this drivel. `City of Angels' is for fans only. My IMDb rating 4.5\/10.
