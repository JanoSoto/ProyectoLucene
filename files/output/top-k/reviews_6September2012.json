","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"6 September 2012","score":"","review":" First of all, when I was a kid I wasn't a fan of westerns mostly because they were old movies and I was skeptical of them. With age I realized that the films made in the past are way better then today's. So a couple of days ago I watched The good, the bad and the ugly for the first time and a bit of skepticism was still present but this movie blew it away.This is a great western movie even if it has been made by an non- American director. Sergio Leone did an amazing job leaving me breathless after a 3-hour adventure. In the focus of the movie are three bandits, lone-wolfs during the civil war in search of a hidden 200 000 dollar treasure. The good is Blondie played by Clint Eastwood who is a cool, intelligent and reasonable man and has a sense of justice and kindness in him which makes him good against the other two main characters. This is visible in the way he treats his friend Tuco, he gives him a hard time but hesitates to kill him (in the final scene) although Tuco was trying to kill him and tortured him in the desert; as well in the scene when he gives his jacket and a cigar to a dying soldier. The bad is a bandit called Angel Eyes played by Lee Van Cleef. He is ruthless and cold-blooded, he knows what he wants and does everything needed to reach his goals. We can see it clearly in the opening scenes of the movie when he is trying to get information from a ordinary man in his house. The man is terrified and reveals the information and gives Angel Eyes his money and Angel Eyes kills him like he has a rock for a heart. The ugly is Tuco played by Eli Wallach, the third bandit and the most complex character in the movie. He has a twisted personality, he's a cheater, a liar, a hypocrite. At first he's was Blondie's enemy and wanted to kill him and the next moment he was his friend because he had interest from him. He has a temper and is quick-minded which gets him often into trouble. But he has this special characteristic - he gets under your skin and is very likable to the audience as well to Blondie.The movie is very interesting, there isn't a wasted scene in the 3-hour play. Scenes are a bit long but gives the viewer enough time to get in it, to fully feel the scene. It is also very tense, many times you know or assume what's going to happen but the length of the scene and the tension blows you away when the scene reaches it's peak. Music in the movie is amazing and I just love the work Ennio Morricone did. I especially loved the music in the scenes in the soldier camp when Wallace was beating Tuco and in the final scene. The Final scene is breath-taking and intense. The three main characters meet at the Cemetery and there is a gun fight going on to see who will collect the money. Blondie assumed Tuco was going to go for Angel Eyes for revenge but sill he wasn't sure because of his nature so he unloaded his pistol some time before, so his only concern was Angel Eyes and Blondie killed him. One of my favorite scenes was the bridge fight with the Alcoholic Union and their captain. That scene has a symbolic meaning i liked. The two opposing armies are fighting over a bridge that must not be destroyed. Every day they meet on the bridge and kill each other for nothing. I think Sergio Leone was trying to say how war is stupid and makes no sense. They wouldn't be fighting there if there weren't a bridge but the bridge mustn't be destroyed. It's is an endless circle. The captain also sees no point but keeps on going because it's bigger then him. The idea of war is terrifying and he uses alcohol to get himself and his soldiers drunk in order to turn their minds of it and give them courage to continue going despite the horror and terror of what lies in front of them. Union Captain at the Bridge Whoever has the most liquor to get the soldiers drunk and send them to be slaughtered... he's the winner. Leone's main characters don't care about the war and are only interested in money, they are surrounded by it and get involved in it a couple of times but only not to raise suspicion and to settle down until they can go forward. He simply divided them and the war which I like. He also acts through them and has impact on the war part of the story and that is when Blondie and Tuco blow up the bridge in order to prevent the fights and get across unnoticed, they did it because they needed to pass to not because they wanted to stop the fighting and useless dying on the bridge, but Leone wanted and he did it through his characters. It also has symbolic meaning.Overall, this is a great film. I don't know much about the movie elements and can't comment on that, but I did Anallise the story and some events as I saw them. Anyway, the movie is great and is defiantly on the top 10 all time best movies list.
