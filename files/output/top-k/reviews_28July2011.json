Cain's novel, the film stars Jack Nicholson as Frank Chambers, the drifter who fell in love with Cora Papadakis (Jessica Lange), a simple housewife who helps her husband Nick (John Colicos) to manage a roadside diner in the East Coast. But they have a plan to kill Nick and live together forever but the destiny has some tricks, up's and down's, twists and turns to make their lives complicated each time their plot fail again and again. The difference between the seductive and classic version of this same story is the approach given by writer David Mamet, who made the love story between these two characters something sexy, animalistic, a full exploration of the senses with a lustful couple ripping each other's clothes, having sex on a kitchen table (one of the most iconic moments of the 1980's), something almost gratuitous but very effective for most audiences nowadays. While Tay Garnett's version was a provocation that could never go too far in its sensuality, only showing short kisses but very effective tender moments, this update is more of a visual film made to present something exciting, thrilling. And Nicholson and Lange have the chemistry and quality in their wild performances here.To me, comparing back to back both films they're equally great just as the novel. They have their differences, specially concerning about the characters characterization and performances of actors, the way they were written. Examples Nicholson is more believable as a hobo than John Garfield, in the way he's dressed, the way he talks and moves; the Cora played by Lange was something new, more passive and quite joyful which is nothing similar than the one of the book and 1946 film materials, who is very smart, dominating in the relationship with Frank; but the most striking difference was the friendly Nick, played here as an rude and irritating man, therefore, the script is basically giving a reason for us not like this guy and cheer that the horrible plans of Frank and Cora become successful. The George C. Scott rule of not giving awards to actors unless the play the same parts is useful here to see in which films the acting worked better. If only we could team Jack Nicholson and Lana Turner together....we would have something explosive and very interesting. On a minor look to the film, I really enjoyed the ending with a devastating moment, without the trial and that whole depressive conclusion (although it ended sad the same way, but this time the viewers will make their own conclusions instead of having the title explained at the final and moralistic scene as MGM's version). Also enjoyed Sven Nykivst colorful cinematography with a right use of darkness in the most tense moments. The melodramatic soundtrack works one time or the other but for the most of the film is just silly. The importance of this version of The Postman Always Rings Twice is the fact that it brought back the film noir with a new style, new faces (ok, Nicholson was in Chinatown in 1974, so it doesn't count) and more baldness.

It's here things get tricker; Danny's ending up unnoticed in the boot of his new step-father's automobile has him witness the murder of one of Rick's old business cohorts, whose true reasons for being in the sleepy town are more broadly linked to Rick's real persona.

It's also one of the most difficult movies to define with a few words. For one thing, the trailer is misleading as it gives the interpretation that this is going to be some underwater adventurous horror flick which this movie definitely isn't. It's also one of the hardest movies to categorize because what is it really? A love story? Yes but certainly not the typical boy meets girl kind. The love story here is between a man and a woman who gave up everything for the sake of love, between two friends, between a man and his only family whose picture he carries in his wallet, between man and the sea and it continues. Is it a thriller? It has elements of a thriller but not the kind with jumps and silly twists. The viewer is so engaged and involved in the characters' lives that you simply are left with little choice but to follow them. Is it an adventure movie? Yes, definitely but it's not another James Bond or Indiana Jones, you'll see why. It has a few elements of science fiction. I could go on and on but as my time is limited at the moment, I'll continue with the technical aspects.'Le Grand Bleu' is a character driven, story driven and atmospheric piece. Besson's direction and writing are exceptionally remarkable.I saw the extended version which is about a good two hours and forty minutes but not for a single moment was I bored. It just flows beautifully. The visuals are mesmerizing (thanks to the superb cinematography, art direction, locations and lighting), the atmosphere is captivating and the score is wonderful.The characters are excellently defined. The title role is stunningly portrayed as being seductive, mysterious, alluring, limitless and above all, free. All the actors do a commendable job. Every actor who is given a speaking part (including the dolphins) does full justice to their character.

Yes, definitely but it's not another James Bond or Indiana Jones, you'll see why. It has a few elements of science fiction. I could go on and on but as my time is limited at the moment, I'll continue with the technical aspects.'Le Grand Bleu' is a character driven, story driven and atmospheric piece.

Bambi goes into the thicket and meets more deer friends along the way.At one point in the movie Bambi and his mother are starting to enjoy the first signs of spring.

While we don't see it we know what happened and Bambi's father tells him that he can't be with his mother anymore. The scene after this is more jubilant and seems to quickly go over the sadness of the last part. Here we see animals start to fall in love during the spring season. Bambi has now become an adolescent deer and he meets up with his childhood companions. The Owl that lives with them in the forest warns them about spring infatuation. Flower, Thumper and Bambi all agree that it will never happen to them; or so they say.In the last few minutes of the movie a fire breaks out after some hunters carelessly leave it. Bambi has to leave and he barely escapes in time along with his father.

All the songs are decent and don't border on anything that might make your head pound. Bambi is a great film. However there are some things that I don't like. The background animation was not the best and that may be in part due to the fact that the war was still going on during that time and the studio may have suffered some financial problems.

Clay Pigeons is just what we're looking for. It's an offbeat film about Clay Bidwell, played by Joaquin Phoenix, whose life takes a dark turn after his best friend commits suicide after finding out Clay has been sleeping with his wife, Amanda. Clay, not wanting anybody to find out about him and Amanda, disposes of the body. This leads to a bundle of lies that pile on one another and are further complicated by the arrival of a mysterious cowboy named Lester Long. Clay quickly learns some very dark secrets about Lester and is forced into helping him keep those secrets. It's a twisted and backwards ride that at times doesn't even feel real it is so bizarre. This film is loads of fun and is a thrilling joy to watch.Clay Pigeons is a film that seems to take itself seriously, but also has a very dark, very grim, sense of humor that pokes its head out in all the wrong places. It comes out in the form of sickening irony and strange satire that plays up the film's dark quirkiness. But these nuances never feel forced and they always seem appropriate for the kind of atmosphere Clay Pigeons tries to capture. The film stays consistent with its dark mood. It gets intense but there's always a hint of sadistic humor hidden in the seriousness of the film.It achieves this balance of two tones through a variety of things. One such element would be the ironically twangy score. There are scenes of murder and violence set to the dueling banjos we're all so familiar with. The film is consistently driven by a very country score that feels so odd and out of place that it makes the film feel just right in all its offbeat finesse. David Dobkin, the film's director, shoots Clay Pigeons with a quirky camera eye with certain shots that are set up very well and capture an ironic intensity that makes the film feel even stranger.And there's no way to talk about this film without mentioning the fantastic performances from the two leads, Joaquin Phoenix and Vince Vaughn. Phoenix is the unfortunate sucker who gets dragged into the events of the film, constantly wanting out but never being able to find a way to escape. Vaughn is the villain of the film who is entertaining yet disturbing. He is an incredibly fun character but also incredibly creepy.

Clay, not wanting anybody to find out about him and Amanda, disposes of the body. This leads to a bundle of lies that pile on one another and are further complicated by the arrival of a mysterious cowboy named Lester Long.

This film is loads of fun and is a thrilling joy to watch.Clay Pigeons is a film that seems to take itself seriously, but also has a very dark, very grim, sense of humor that pokes its head out in all the wrong places. It comes out in the form of sickening irony and strange satire that plays up the film's dark quirkiness. But these nuances never feel forced and they always seem appropriate for the kind of atmosphere Clay Pigeons tries to capture. The film stays consistent with its dark mood. It gets intense but there's always a hint of sadistic humor hidden in the seriousness of the film.It achieves this balance of two tones through a variety of things.

In brief, this is the story of the inner world of an exceptional pianist and piano teacher who lives with her mother in a 'marriage arrangement' that appears to satisfy both with its accompanying fights, jealousies, cheatings, and clingings. This cold pianist (incomparably portrayed by the fine Isabelle Huppert) is absorbed by Schubert and Schumann and shares many of those composers' tendencies towards madness and melancholy. Her private acting out of her sexual life includes forays into pornography video booths, drive-in movies for voyeurism, and other sadomasochistic practices that leave her frustrated in her drive to be humiliated and beaten. Into this sad woman's life enters a sensuously handsome student (again, played with complete credibility and finesse by Benoit Magimel) and much of the film is a hard driving match between lust\/desire and need\/repulsion, the true approach\/avoidance conflict. The pace of the film is so correct for a story about the extended periods of ennui between moments of exhilaration that mirror the life inside a music academy. We are treated to some wonderful Schubert, Schumann, Schonberg, and Bach that serves as the 'dialogue' during extended scenes where the piano teacher listens with her eyes and ears and distorted mind, reacting to the music in equal parts with the performing students. Yes, this is a disturbing film, but it is not a grotesque film. Director Michael Haneke manages to place this surreal sexual tragedy for us to understand just how wide the bell curve of human sexuality stretches. An astonishingly fine film - if you are open to explore the dark interstices of the human mind without prejudice. An added feature of an interview on the DVD with Isabelle Huppert about the character she portrays is exceptionally apropos and well filmed.

Her private acting out of her sexual life includes forays into pornography video booths, drive-in movies for voyeurism, and other sadomasochistic practices that leave her frustrated in her drive to be humiliated and beaten. Into this sad woman's life enters a sensuously handsome student (again, played with complete credibility and finesse by Benoit Magimel) and much of the film is a hard driving match between lust\/desire and need\/repulsion, the true approach\/avoidance conflict. The pace of the film is so correct for a story about the extended periods of ennui between moments of exhilaration that mirror the life inside a music academy. We are treated to some wonderful Schubert, Schumann, Schonberg, and Bach that serves as the 'dialogue' during extended scenes where the piano teacher listens with her eyes and ears and distorted mind, reacting to the music in equal parts with the performing students. Yes, this is a disturbing film, but it is not a grotesque film. Director Michael Haneke manages to place this surreal sexual tragedy for us to understand just how wide the bell curve of human sexuality stretches. An astonishingly fine film - if you are open to explore the dark interstices of the human mind without prejudice. An added feature of an interview on the DVD with Isabelle Huppert about the character she portrays is exceptionally apropos and well filmed.

Grady Harp ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"28 July 2011","score":"","review":" The subject matter is fascinating. Nell (Jodie Foster) is a young woman raised by her mother in a setting completely cut off from civilization. She knows nothing of the outside world and has had little if any interaction with other people throughout her life, to the point at which she's developed her own language. Discovered by a grocery store delivery boy when her mother died, she comes under the care and tutelage of Drs. Lovell and Olson (Liam Neesom and Natasha Richardson) who have to decide whether or not she should be taken from her isolated environment and introduced to the real world.The dilemma is very powerful. What right does anyone else have to decide for Nell how her life should be lived, especially when she's clearly capable of living on her own in the environment to which she's accustomed? Why should she be subject to court orders about her fate or to living in psychiatric hospitals when there's obviously nothing really wrong with her except that she's living a life that no one in the outside world can understand? Those are tough questions. The movie does a great job of developing the relationship between Nell and Lovell (and then also Olson) in a sensitive way, as both begin to care for Nell and want to be protective of her and her rights to choose. Jodie Foster was - I thought - surprisingly good in this role. She usually plays a stronger type, and - at least as the movie opens - Nell was a very vulnerable figure. I didn't know if Foster would work in such a role, but she pulled it off perfectly.I would criticize this film only for the overly happy ending. Beginning with Nell appearing in court, this took on a too syrupy fell in my opinion; everything in the end was far too happy to be believable - in my opinion anyway. But aside from that I thought this was a very well done movie and a very interesting story. (7\/10) ","genre":null},{"date":"28 July 2011","score":"","review":" The subject matter is fascinating.
