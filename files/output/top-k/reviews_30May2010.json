Alexander Payne is one of the best directors alive. Why is it that the best directors take so long to do a movie. Payne's last film, Sideways, came out 6 years ago. Payne's best film is About Schmidt, though Sideways was a great movie too. But, one of his that you should never forget, is Election.Election is such a funny movie. Reese Witherspoon is what makes this realistic comedy hilarious. Especially in the scene when she tears down all of the posters. Her character in this movie, is so realistic. Because you can see people doing what she does. Or at least somebody in a school election.Witherspoon stars as Tracy Flick, a teenager really wanting to win the school election. She's insane when it comes to this stuff. Matthew Broderick plays a high school teacher who hates her. He wants a jock(played by Chris Klein) to win. And this election starts to ruin his life.Payne's dialogue is hilarious. This is a man with a true talent. I really wish he would do more films. Because every movie that he does is awesome. Election, to me, isn't as good as Sideways or About Schmidt. But, like all of his films, it's still awesome,hilarious, and terrific.Election A+ ","genre":null},{"date":"30 May 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Matthew Borderick and Reese Witherspoon star in Election.
