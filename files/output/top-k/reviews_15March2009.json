For example, most movies by the Coen Brothers are like that. Also, Terry Gilliam's work is a little hard to get at the first time. Ed Wood by His Royale Weirdness Tim Burton is another example. When I watched it the first time I thought Nice movie, now it's one of my all time favorite movies. And I will tell you my reasons Johnny Depp seems to have lost himself completely in his character. His performance is simply adorable. He maximizes the fun of the screenplay in every scene. Just remember when the baptists tell him that they find the title Grave robbers from outer space blasphemies, and they'd rather call it Plan 9 from outer space. Ed Wood's answer is just That's ridiculous. The way Depp says this one liner makes me give myself away every time I watch it.Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi is a blast. It's a miracle how he looks just like him, his accent is amazing and his mimic completes his perfect performance.Sarah Jessica Parker is also great (her best role till today). Still she couldn't even closely play Dolores Fullers roles in Glen or Glenda or Bride of the monster as badly as the original Dolores (believe me, I saw her).Bill Murray's performance is a little hard to describe. He actually manages to overact using his usual minimalism, which is kind of weird but still he's fun to watch.The story itself couldn't be better. Ed Wood is a very likable character. He's so positive and dedicated to everything he does (like directing, writing, acting AND producing) even though his career is one big failure. His movies are considered to be the worst of all time, but in spite of his total lack of talent he somehow manages to raise up enough money to do his next film, of course not exactly without having problems on the way down the road.If you watch an actual Ed Wood movie you can't deny that there's a certain production value in most cases. It's just the little details (besides the plot, of course) that make us laugh. Just like in Ed Wood. So if you didn't like, give it one more chance or maybe two.

For No's adversary is a fellow named Bond, James Bond. Bond is about to make life very brutish and short for No, not to mention a generation-plus of other evil geniuses to come.When I first saw Dr. No, it was the early 1980s and I had a decidedly negative reaction to the backwards-feeling of this inaugural piece. Sean Connery wore blue pants, his adversaries wore Glad bags, the pace was slow, the explosions few, the Bond quips less ready, and the girls wore too much clothing.There are still things about the movie that don't work too well, or have aged badly. Bond's final escape and confrontation with No is all-too-easy. A scene involving a tarantula is as fake-looking as anything in Die Another Day. Yet time has been kind to this film in other ways. Now I see the classical brilliance of it, in the way it takes its time to establish the formula other Bond films would take for granted. Dr. No utilizes only two global locations. England was Bond's homeland, and Jamaica the place where Ian Fleming wrote his Bond novels, so it works wonderfully to see them here; especially Jamaica, at a time when Fleming was still living there writing Bond novels.It's worth noting and celebrating how much of this film would go on and become definitive beyond the character of Bond himself. The theme music, really by Monty Norman though I read for years that was a miscredit, remains a fixture of the series. Despite 40 years of amazing competition, Ursula Andress was recently named the Best Bond Girl of all time, and four reasons for that judgment are on ample display here (referring of course to her eyes and cheek, eh, bones). There's also M and Moneypenny and Felix Leiter, who like Bond has been played by half-a-dozen different actors over time. Here its Jack Lord, whose femmy sunglasses rival Bond's blue pants for the film's most grievous fashion faux-pas.Director Terence Young and editor Peter Hunt work wonderfully well in tandem setting up a tension that is the cinematic equivalent of what Bond readers know as the Fleming Sweep. The script hews closely to the source novel, and when it departs, presents a distinct improvement. No's cover operation is a bauxite plant, not a guano farm. A pair of villains, Professor Dent (Anthony Dawson) and Miss Taro (Zena Marshall), are welcome additions to the story and help keep No comfortably offstage until the final half-hour.The script does most right, and is done right in turn, by the way it serves Connery, an actor of immeasurable presence who makes Bond believable in his chosen, deadly occupation. Connery was not my favorite Bond actor, but he was absolutely the right man for launching the role, giving Bond both a sullenness and a sense of humor that would define the role long after he left the series.Noting how No's convex undersea window magnifies fish swimming outside, Bond remarks Minnows pretending to be whales.

Wit, a friend the Marquis de Bellegarde (Jean Rochefort) tells young Ponceludon, opens all doors and can win King Louis XVI's favor; and once you have the king's favor, he will give you whatever you want. Indeed, one comes away with the impression that the king's generosity towards the witty is so boundless that he seems oblivious to the reality that he is spending money that the state does not have. Only the finance minister knows how bad things are and he grumbles to Ponceludon that perhaps he could convince the king to stop spending so much money on his courtiers for the dignity of France. Well, as far as Louis XVI (Urbain Cancelier) is concerned, dignity can go to hell.Like all high schools, the French court is artificial, cruel, witty and a haven for endless sex. The courtiers subjected to ridicule are weak, insecure and tend articulate themselves rather badly. They could be popular courtiers who have misspoken, thereby providing an ambitious courtier with the opportunity to ridicule them. The women don't believe in love. They will have sex with any man who happens to be the most popular at any given time. When Abbe de Vilecourt (Bernard Giraudeau) falls into disfavor, Madame de Blayac (Fanny Ardant) turns to Ponceludon. She then finds another lover, when Ponceludon inadvertently ridicules her.Now all of this may seem very predictable, unless you were home schooled during your high school years, but it is entertaining most of the time in wicked sort of way. We enjoy hearing the witticism; we enjoy even more seeing people insulted, especially when it is the vile de Vilecourt. But this film also has a serious and a profound side as well. On being ridiculed, Ponceludon condemns the world of the courtier as a farce. It is not a witty remark. But Madame de Blayac realizes he is right. She realizes that she has been duped, because all her life was wasted on an endless struggle trying to be popular, pretty and charming. A life without love and indeed without meaning. It was not too late for Ponceludon, because he was still young and had only stayed in court for a few months. But it was too late for Madame de Blayac, because she had nothing else apart from that pointless life. Perhaps that explains her tears, when in her moment of victory Ponceludon leaves the court for good and the dancing resumes.I could go on about the film. At times it is boring, but on the whole director Patrice LeConte does an excellent job in maintaining our interest. The performances are good too, especially the one given by Fanny Ardant. Finally, the film has a brilliant baroque score which creates the atmosphere of a ruthless and uncompromising court. The sets and costumes are beautiful too, but what is decisive in films like these is excellent direction, a good screenplay and brilliant performances this film has all three.

Well, as far as Louis XVI (Urbain Cancelier) is concerned, dignity can go to hell.Like all high schools, the French court is artificial, cruel, witty and a haven for endless sex. The courtiers subjected to ridicule are weak, insecure and tend articulate themselves rather badly. They could be popular courtiers who have misspoken, thereby providing an ambitious courtier with the opportunity to ridicule them. The women don't believe in love. They will have sex with any man who happens to be the most popular at any given time. When Abbe de Vilecourt (Bernard Giraudeau) falls into disfavor, Madame de Blayac (Fanny Ardant) turns to Ponceludon. She then finds another lover, when Ponceludon inadvertently ridicules her.Now all of this may seem very predictable, unless you were home schooled during your high school years, but it is entertaining most of the time in wicked sort of way. We enjoy hearing the witticism; we enjoy even more seeing people insulted, especially when it is the vile de Vilecourt. But this film also has a serious and a profound side as well. On being ridiculed, Ponceludon condemns the world of the courtier as a farce. It is not a witty remark. But Madame de Blayac realizes he is right. She realizes that she has been duped, because all her life was wasted on an endless struggle trying to be popular, pretty and charming. A life without love and indeed without meaning. It was not too late for Ponceludon, because he was still young and had only stayed in court for a few months. But it was too late for Madame de Blayac, because she had nothing else apart from that pointless life. Perhaps that explains her tears, when in her moment of victory Ponceludon leaves the court for good and the dancing resumes.I could go on about the film. At times it is boring, but on the whole director Patrice LeConte does an excellent job in maintaining our interest. The performances are good too, especially the one given by Fanny Ardant.

Wit, a friend the Marquis de Bellegarde (Jean Rochefort) tells young Ponceludon, opens all doors and can win King Louis XVI's favor; and once you have the king's favor, he will give you whatever you want.

Could we say it was shot dead? Or is that too Jewish a piece of humor? The plot is absurd and that is why it is funny, but not a deep intellectual funny, nor a deep artistic and esthetic funny, nor even a deep emotional funny. Just funny for war time, funny for when everyone is crying, weeping or plain dying. We think of the other Jewish actor who did a similar impersonation of Hitler, Charlie Chaplin. But Charlie Chaplin played the real Hitler, whereas here it is always a false Hitler, tricking the real one in his back. That is funny for sure but that is also kind of vain, except if you take it is as a plain entertainment for an audience that wants to laugh at their arch enemy. So they play the Mickey out of him. But what's left after sixty or more years? Not much except the scene about to be or not to be, played three times on a stage in the context of Hamlet in the film. The force of this sequence is in the fact that an actor plays Hamlet in front of an audience and a member of that audience stands up and walks out on him when he says that sentence, and the scene is of course in front of another audience, us. The second level of that distantiation is what makes it funny because we can see the varying surprise and anger of the actor who takes it as an insult before he learns it was coded language. And it is true Ehrard has it right when he says that what this Tura actor did to Shakespeare, they, the Nazis, are doing it to Poland. But then the third time, and that is only true for us, though also for one person in the audience in the theater in the film, it becomes absurd because there is no explanation for that total stranger to stand up and walk out. But apart from that the film has aged tremendously and even the acting has aged and seems so unnatural, though we can accept that from most of the main actors who are supposed to be actors and hence to play a role, even in real life. The only important thing is that in 1942 the film is heavily speaking of concentration camps. If Lubitsch knew about it, why didn't the allies know about it and why didn't they do something to stop the massacre? At least they had no excuse and they cannot pretend they were less informed than Lubitsch.

When Lucas first proposed Star Wars the board at 20th Century Fox probably thought he was mad, especially since special effects were primitive at best. Who could have envisioned what he had in mind when he first made the original? Who could have imagined what a light saber was? As many have stated, this is much better than the original, and I wholeheartedly agree. After watching a film so many times, people become immune to the amazing innovations shown. A good example is Citizen Kane which included memorable imagery including deep focus, low angle shots that showed ceilings, overlapping dialogue, and camera trickery. Many people see Kane for the first time and proclaim Big deal! In The Empire Strikes Back, some of original innovations are the Imperial Walkers, the ice planet of Hoth and the Zen-like Yoda who philosophizes with phrases like Try not. Do. Or Do not. There is no try. I won't re-hash the plot since everyone knows it by now, so I will review the intricacies that make this film work so well. I think the humor in this film works tremendously for one, the interplay between Han Solo and C3PO cracks me up (Sir if I may venture an opinion-- I'm not really interested in your opinions 3PO.). Another thing that works is another character not listed in the credits--the Millennium Falcon. The lovable piece of junk that is forever under repair but always comes through in the clutch, like when Han et al were trying to escape from Hoth. There was a pretty tense moment when the Falcon wouldn't start while the Empire's stormtroopers entered the docking bay (Would it help if I got out and pushed? It might!). And yet, the Falcon came through as always when the laser machine gun appeared. Further, the non-functioning light speed on the Falcon is a great sub-plot of the film.Darth Vader is at his very best (or worst?) in the way he kills off his own men who fail him. The scene when he kills off Admiral Ozzle is priceless not only for Vader's vengeance but for Admiral Piett's trying not to look at his dead former commander on the deck. Another great scene is Vader killing off Captain Needa (Apology accepted Captain Needa.) I will even overlook the borrowing from Casablanca in that film, the Nazis first won't let Victor Lazlow leave Casablanca and then change their minds when they won't let him stay. In this film, Princess Leia was supposed to stay and then Vader altered the plans.Some of the greatest films are great in part to the score. How John Williams didn't win an Oscar is another infamous slight by the Academy (He did win a BAFTA).

Whilst many may argue it is obviously sceptical, you cannot help but wonder what happens behind closed doors.The pace is consistently active with an investigation into the murder of a congressman turning into a thriller and drama once Independence Day actor Will Smith enters. The plot revolves around a man who finds a tape of the murder in his possession and then turning it over to Dean with his awareness. The NSA then track Dean into finding this tape that will unravel their organisation if ever exposed. The chase scenes at the beginning are well handed, maintaining enough realism without diving too far into exaggerated stunts or technical superiority. Dean's story adds drama to the mix with his business dealings with an ex-girlfriend and a struggling home life because of it.Smith's charm isn't fully active but he gains enough good will and drama to maintain the clueless act of a man who really does not know what is going on. Gene Hackman's Brill is one of the closed off intelligent guys that you have to love. That hard hit business like style with an own agenda and the little cheek the Unforgiven star brings is exquisite.There are lapses and unrealistic moments.

This polished Universal Pictures' release uses an autistic child as it gimmick. A compassionate but rebellious FBI agent (Bruce Willis) is the only character who stands between the youngster and inevitable death after his parents are murdered. Essentially, Mercury Rising combines familiar elements from the Harrison Ford thriller Witness and the Dustin Hoffman movie Rain Man with a touch of the Robert Redford espionage tingler Three Days of the Condor thrown in for good measure. This pallid suspense melodrama generates only marginal thrills and chills. A cliffhanger conclusion is about as pulsating as this dreary thriller gets. Mercury Rising is incredibly predictable. No way is the FBI going to kill a handicapped child. Nothing is more manipulative than plunging a defenseless adolescent in jeopardy. Further, Mercury Rising is tedious because the autistic boy is either annoying or too much of a zombie. The filmmakers tug without a qualm at your heartstrings to evoke feelings of sympathy for this orphaned urchin. Mercury Rising starts falling down from the get-go and doesn't let up until its lackluster shoot-out finale atop a skyscraper helipad.As veteran FBI agent Art Jeffries, Willis sports a Pulp Fiction haircut and wears basically the same outfit. When the movie opens, Jeffries is working undercover with a gang of bank robbers besieged by the police. Although the criminals don't know it, Jeffries plans to surprise them until an overzealous FBI superior sends a phalanx of heavily armed agents into the bank. The Feds mow down anybody in sight. Two of the casualties are teenage boys, forced by their larcenous father to participate in the hold-up. A frustrated Jeffries assaults the FBI chief, and then finds himself reassigned to marginal stake-out jobs. In other words, a cliché of a cop character. No dog. No girlfriend. Just a bottle of downers and an attitude. Why Bruce Willis squandered his time with either this standard issue character or this jaded thriller is puzzling.Meanwhile, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholas Kudrow (Alec Baldwin of The Departed), a slippery patriotic NSA official, is soaking up the limelight. He has masterminded the creation of a quantum-leap communications spy code dubbed 'Mercury Rising.' Mercury is an undecipherable, sophisticated spy code that enables undercover government operatives to pass along information undetected by friend or foe. Two nerdy computer nerds working on the project have proved that the code is unbreakable. As a redundant back-up, they hide the code in a harmless puzzle magazine. The child, Simon (Miko Hughes of Apollo 13), gets a copy of the magazine, spots the cipher and gives them a call. The NSA freaks out and Kudrow wants to kill everybody involved and leave behind no traces. Kudrow is justifiably furious when he learns that the programmers concealed the code in the magazine without his approval. Paranoia haunts Kudrow. He fears the worst and dispatches a fish-eyed hit-man to kill, kill, kill! Under Harold Becker's laidback, low-key direction, Mercury Rising merely simmers. Becker appears determined to play down as much of the action as possible. Nothing in the pedestrian Lawrence Rosenthal script comes as a surprise. Sometimes, the action seems unintentionally funny. During a life-and-death struggle between Kudrow and Jeffries, a gun is lost. The autistic child spots the pistol and walks almost too casually out onto the ledge. Wind ruffling his hair, he retrieves the gun with no thought to the high altitude and takes it back to Jeffries. While Jeffries and Kudrow swap blows, Simon hands the gun Jeffries the firearm. No suspense whatsoever is evoked by Simon's perilous ledge walking stunt. The autistic child gimmick backfires because the child is blind to his own welfare. When the filmmakers want to goose you , they let Simon wander off and into either an on-rushing train or car. These sudden, abrupt shock periodically punch up the film's lethargic pace. Indeed, Miko Hughes is splendid as Simon. He wears a faraway stare and displays convincing body language. Simon, however, is a leaden role. Rarely in jeopardy, he divides his time between screaming when strangers touch him and solving dangerous puzzles. Bullets are whining through the air and his sudden rescues from trains and cars are just too spontaneous to qualify as suspenseful. By the time you figure out that Simon could have been killed, Simon is safe.Baldwin does an exceptional job as the antagonist when he appears on screen as an urbane, darkly-lit, menacing figure. He doesn't cross swords with Willis until almost an hour or more into the action. Good thrillers pit hero against villain as early as possible, and the earlier the better. This mantra helps stoke the emotional factor. They meet only twice, but both times Willis holds the best cards. The shallow script undermines their adversarial chemistry. Baldwin's baddie is far to neutral despite his bloodthirsty attitude to hate with a passion. Nobody will be copy-catting any of the antics in this flick. Mercury Rising is almost comatose because the villains lag so far behind Jeffries that he has time to catch forty winks. When the hero of an actioneer isn't leaping through flaming hoops or scrambling into a siren's bed, he is having it far too easy. Translation zero excitement. The action never takes off like a roller-coaster. About the only inspirational aspect of Mercury Rising is John Barry's moody musical score that underlines each scene. If some of the music sounds different, Carter Burwell substituted for a couple of scenes. Lenser Michael Seresin's widescreen photography and Peter Honess' editing endow Mercury Rising with a sleek, seamless gloss. Mercury Rising has a considerably less than quicksilver pace. Only die-hard Bruce Willis fans need apply. Everybody else will be disappointed.

Pierre and his stepmother have a rather...curious relationship.Pierre, Lucie, and Thibault seem to have a triangular relationship, and the actual points to the triangle are not quite certain...Lucie's brother is a bit of a eunuch, or is he ? And Isabelle, who is she really ?? Overall, I think it was worth my time. An interesting film, and one that makes me want to read Melville.

They are befriended by an Aborigine boy who is on a walkabout, his quest for adulthood in the wilds of nature. Can they get back home ?This is probably my favourite of Roeg's many fine films (a toss-up with The Witches) and like so much of his work is visually dazzling, thematically fascinating and a completely unique movie. The story is so sparse as to be almost non-existent; what matters is the landscape and the unusual relationships between the white kids and the native, who can't speak each other's languages and don't understand each other's cultures. Although they are separated by these immense barriers, they become friends through the simplest and most basic requirements of life; food, shelter, leisure, purpose. The film alternately shows their happiness together and reinforces the differences of their backgrounds - all the white people we encounter are either living meaningless rat race lives, exploiting others or killing animals for no reason. Like a few other films (Badlands, Southern Comfort, much of Werner Herzog's work), the setting is really the fourth character in the movie, full of amazing vistas of sand, rocky canyons and lush groves filled with plants and animals - echidnas, cockatoos, wallabies, scorpions, frill-necked lizards, a wombat which snuffles at the children while they are sleeping. The landscapes are hypnotic and dazzling, giving the movie an unreal, dreamy quality which somehow makes is seem more naturalistic, almost a documentary. The three actors - although what they're doing almost transcends acting - are all terrific; Agutter is hauntingly beautiful, perhaps the best representation of repressed sexual awakening in cinema, whilst Gulpilil is charismatic and iconic (and is in several other great films). Whilst credited as Lucien John, the boy is really Roeg's son, and oddly it's him who really bridges the characters and holds the story together - in what other big studio movie does one eight-year-old boy speak two-thirds of the dialogue ? Featuring a rich John Barry score, this is extremely well directed and photographed by Roeg (his first solo effort) - a rich, moving and beautiful film. Based on a book by James Vance Marshall and shot in amazing locations all over the magical land of Oz.

I thought that it would be very slow and boring, but I was wrong. 3 well spent hours. The movie has a good story and great characters. It also has good jokes. You could actually call this a comedy. Kikuchiyo is probably the best character. His really funny, he raises the villages and our morale, but he is also a brave warrior. The movie also has drama and adventure and these parts are also great. I already talked about Kikuchiyo, but the other six samurais are also great characters. We have a very serious guy who only wants to perfect his fighting skills, we have an older and very smart samurai, a youngster, who is still more a kid then a warrior, etc.A movie well worth watching! 10PS. This is for the younger generation. I am 18 years old, still I sat down to watch a 3 hours long black and white movie. It doesn't have to be in color to be good. And its much better then the sh*** Hollywood has to offer. Old movies are not as spectacular as new ones, they don't have pyrotechnics, but at least they have a meaning!They make you think.
