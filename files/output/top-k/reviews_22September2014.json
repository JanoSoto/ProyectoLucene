Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both won Oscars for their screenplay of this movie back when it released and believe me when I say that this movie's script is one of the best in film in my opinion.I know that's a stretch but every character conversation,no matter what the mood of the scene,is filled with interesting and important dialog.I literally won't watch this movie with out subtitles just because I don't wanna risk missing an important piece of info or some character development.There are scenes in this movie that can bring me tears with either sadness or hilarity,this is definitely a layered movie.All this makes the story that much more believable and that of course makes for extremely likable and developed characters.Seriously even minor characters have their moments throughout. With these great characters,you definitely get great performances.Matt Damon is as good as I've ever seen him,he has these one takes where he goes on and on spewing out all this mind numbing but intriguing dialog.Ben Affleck is in this one,however he really plays the secondary character here.That doesn't mean he doesn't get a few good scenes here and there,I actually liked his character as well.Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard both give really good supporting performances as well.As for Mr.Williams,I really don't have to say anything.What more need be said by now,you know? His performance in this movie puts you through so many different emotions as does his character and it works SO effectively,he's perfect! The music by Danny Elfman is subtle but really kicks when it has to and the cinematography is also actually very good after I rewatched this on Blu-ray.Gus Van Sant may not be a houshold name but he really has this way of making the movie seem almost like a documentary sometimes,he brings realism to his films and a lot of welcomed depth to his characters. With this review I'd like to say one last goodbye to my childhood hero,Robin Williams and praise his performance as well as this film that still gets me Every time!You can call it a sympathy rating but I cant help but give this movie a perfect 10\/10 because its MY review and despite the circumstances,this is really a GREAT film and I love it.Of course I give GOOD WILL HUNTING MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.

This movie has a few powerful messages, like one Timon and Pumba's song Hakuna Matatata, a message about no worries which helps Simba forget about what he had just faced earlier. It's really nice to hear messages about not worrying as songs like that help us forget some of our own worries. The other message this film leaves us with is responsibility. Simba gets used to an easy life and no longer considers being king, like he was looking forward to earlier in the movie as his responsibility. Can Simba be persuaded to go back to Pride Rock, or should he just continue living his easy worry free life with Timon and Pumba? So, yeah it leaves us with a positive message and it is in all a beautiful film. A film with just animals, there are no people in it. We get to see very beautiful scenery, especially in the beginning of the movie and lots of animals. The songs are really nice songs you'd want to listen to, and there is a great story involved. It's also great how this movie isn't computer animated like almost all the animated movies that come out nowadays are. It's nice to just see really great drawings of Africa and wildlife. It's been a huge success as it's one of the highest grossing movies ever and it even has more home video copies sold than any other film.

And the BIG question #1 I've asked myself about this movie was how come George Lucas who used to be such a wonderful director back in the past with his first Star Wars film (that doesn't mean I liked it at all, but I still have no doubt that at THE TIME it was a very good movie) in the past, started disappointing us with his very first Star Wars Episode which explores the past of the original trilogy? What on earth happened to him? Was it a financial problem that lead the unsuccess of the first Episode, did he just somewhat stupidly forgot about the mistakes he did in his directing, or was it something else? Whatever it is, I'm sure Lucas didn't mean to disappoint fans around the world. It's not in his nature. But whatever happened that lead to the unsuccess of the movie, I would advice George Lucas to be more careful next time and to think harder when he makes a movie, to avoid any possible future misleads. The one most important thing people should know about this movie is that even if it is highly flawed, it is still a Star Wars film, which means that it still keeps you entertained! Despite its flaws, I liked Star Wars and gladly enough it offers a few of the best scenes in the entire Star Wars saga, like the wonderful technical construction of the underwater Gungan city (that includes the Gungan transport as well.), the astonishing and intense light saber battle against the villainous Darth Maul (along with equally astonishing stunts) near the end of the film and the exhilarating Pod Race on planet Tatooine, during the middle of the movie. These were few improvements, so a big hand of applause to George Lucas for not driving away from the original and exciting stuff! The special effects were very good also! I also became a huge fan of Darth Maul, because of his very good makeup. The first time I saw his face in the movie, I looked at his face for the first time, in awe! His face was so unbelievably devilish looking and that frightened me! Some people complained that there was not enough Darth Maul, but that's a complain I strongly disagree with because in my opinion, not seeing him enough during the entire movie made it feel more mysterious in terms of the Sith's mysterious return, the Sith that were thought to be extinct a millennium ago, and I think it is better this way for that very purpose. Another BIG question I've been asking myself about this movie was the following what was Lucas' thoughts behind the Jar Jar Bink character? I've learned that this character was met with generally or mostly extreme negative criticism and that I'm not surprised. Fortunately, I found out why George Lucas added this frankly not funny Gungan plague. It was for comic relief, but that of course we all know it's obvious, but here is a more precise reason as to why this character was added. From what I've read, he wanted to added Jar Jar Binks as a comic relief for people 12 years old or younger, so that might mean that it was never meant to apply to us teenagers and adults. What do you think? I felt Jar Jar was alright from time to time, but at times like almost everyone else my age I found him unfunny and annoying. When you hear 'Star Wars EPISODE I' you hear EPISODE I which makes you feel and think that because it is the very first Episode of an entire legendary saga trilogy and that it connects with the amazing original trilogy, then it should really be a very good movie. That's exactly how I feel and think when thinking about this first episode and when I think of this sentence I feel very angry with George Lucas and disappointed that Phantom Menace was ruined. It could have been a blockbuster, but it's now miles away and a pity that you can't turn back the past and make this movie again. Have any of you guys reading this exactly felt and thought this way? Overall, Phantom Menace delivered on the friendly thrills we all want, but it lacks a full thematic richness and a narrative complexity. Despite the flaws, I spare Phantom Menace as an overall movie for all the other good things it managed to offer.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"22 September 2014","score":"","review":" The thought of prison terrifies him, give him some television it'll calm him down.This brilliant film took me by surprise in many ways. First and foremost is John Travolta's excellent against-type performance as Sam, a simple, impulsive security guard who makes the stupid mistake of trying to get his job back with a shotgun. What is his plan? God knows. But he quickly becomes part of the plan of a disgraced reporter (Dustin Hoffman; excellent) to get back on top with a great story. Unfortunately for Sam there's a school trip arranged for the day he decides to wave a shotgun around to get his job back, and he accidentally shoots his fellow security guard Cliff when he jerks the gun to the side, creating a hostage situation. This man could not possibly be more unfortunate, and that gives Max Brackett a window of opportunity to play to the public and tell the story to make his career. So he manipulates Sam into playing for the public and gaining sympathy, and Sam becomes a symbol of the everyman in the eyes of the public. This film is both blackly funny and deeply disturbing, not least in it's portrayal of the intrusiveness of news people and widespread effect of the media and how it sways and is swayed by public opinion. As the film progresses it all starts to look like some vicious gamble that can backfire on it's players and leave people destroyed. It becomes nothing more than a hopeless situation, and the final crane shot at the end of Max Brackett bloodied and being swarmed by reporters almost reminds of that shot in The Wild Bunch of the red ants swarming the scorpions.So I was really impressed with this film. The message is obvious but it never gets annoying. The ensemble cast is excellent all round, Hoffman goes from cunning and arrogant to disillusioned and finally helpless, Alan Alda, that guy from M.A.S.H. is excellent and convincing as a popular news anchor, and Mia Kirshner turns quickly from being a naive intern reporter to a parasite.

First and foremost is John Travolta's excellent against-type performance as Sam, a simple, impulsive security guard who makes the stupid mistake of trying to get his job back with a shotgun. What is his plan? God knows. But he quickly becomes part of the plan of a disgraced reporter (Dustin Hoffman; excellent) to get back on top with a great story. Unfortunately for Sam there's a school trip arranged for the day he decides to wave a shotgun around to get his job back, and he accidentally shoots his fellow security guard Cliff when he jerks the gun to the side, creating a hostage situation. This man could not possibly be more unfortunate, and that gives Max Brackett a window of opportunity to play to the public and tell the story to make his career. So he manipulates Sam into playing for the public and gaining sympathy, and Sam becomes a symbol of the everyman in the eyes of the public. This film is both blackly funny and deeply disturbing, not least in it's portrayal of the intrusiveness of news people and widespread effect of the media and how it sways and is swayed by public opinion. As the film progresses it all starts to look like some vicious gamble that can backfire on it's players and leave people destroyed. It becomes nothing more than a hopeless situation, and the final crane shot at the end of Max Brackett bloodied and being swarmed by reporters almost reminds of that shot in The Wild Bunch of the red ants swarming the scorpions.So I was really impressed with this film. The message is obvious but it never gets annoying. The ensemble cast is excellent all round, Hoffman goes from cunning and arrogant to disillusioned and finally helpless, Alan Alda, that guy from M.A.S.H. is excellent and convincing as a popular news anchor, and Mia Kirshner turns quickly from being a naive intern reporter to a parasite.

Although it is directed by Tony Scott, Tarantino wrote the script and so you can see his handwriting in the film. And what about the movie? The main actors are C. Slater and P.

I must admit that I only recently heard of this movie, and there are so many faces who are acting it's just unbelievable.

Almost every scene in the film is superbly made\u200B\u200B, the acting and dialog are priceless to me.

That would be fine if that were indeed the story that the movie wanted to tell.Instead 'Backbeat' puts George, Paul, Ringo and Pete Best (the band's first drummer) in minor supporting roles in order to tell the story of Stuart Sutcliff (Stephen Dorff) who's only footnote in history is that he died just shortly before the band took the world by storm.Sutcliff isn't interested in music and that's just as well because we aren't really much interested in him. The other members of the band aren't too crazy about Sutcliff. He was briefly in the band and was a friend of John Lennon and the movie flirts with the idea that they may have been in love with Stuart's girlfriend and with Stuart.The film's sole merit is the brilliant, almost eerie performance of Ian Hart as the young John Lennon. His face, his voice and his mannerisms are dead on. He has played Lennon before in a movie called 'The Hours and Times' which speculated on his affair with Brian Epstein while on holiday in Spain in 1963.The problem is that the movie never tells us what it finds so fascinating about Sutcliff. How different would the success of The Beatles have been without his contribution? Basically if you take him out of this story you don't have much left. It would simply be a dull movie about a guy living in England during the 60s who paints, has a girlfriend and dies of a hemorrhage at a very young age.How did The Beatles hit it big? When did they realize that they had made it? What happened to Pete Best? How did the foursome originally get together? How did they get along initially? The answers aren't to be found here.

I expect for little Republic, stars like Trevor and Pidgeon were more expensive than usual. However, the romantic triangle (Wayne-Trevor-Pidgeon) gets a lot of dialog time, too much for a title that promises lots of action. Still, Wayne is little short of terrific. It's before he became frozen into the tough-guy icon that didn't demand much besides a growl and a hard-eyed stare. But here, catch his first cozy talk with Trevor. His subtle reactions are perfectly calibrated, proving he could deliver sensitivity when called upon.Pidgeon too, is excellent as the commanding Cantrell, along with Gabby Hayes providing his usual comic relief and with teeth, no less. Except, I don't think I'll be making an appointment with him anytime soon. And, of course, there's a young Roy Rogers, making an apt impression in a role that's almost a lead, along with the severe Marjorie Main in an odd and inessential role. Anyway, Republic popped for a lot of extras, especially for the last battle scenes. So if the big action's a long time coming, it's worth waiting for. Then too, note how the script avoids denigrating either the Union or the Confederacy in the lead up to the big war. This was very much a feature of many 40's and 50's westerns. After all, a movie's going to be shown in Atlanta as well as New York.All in all, the film's as much an actor's showcase as it is an epic western, a movie of parts rather than well-blended whole. Nonetheless, in my book, it's John Wayne at his physical and histrionic best, totally convincing as the virile and unaffected young Seton. And if the 94- minutes is somewhat uneven, Wayne certainly is not.

In Sweden, dying of cancer Agnes is visited in her home by her sisters Karin and Maria. As Agnes' condition gets worse and the pain becomes more difficult, many feelings and emotions such fear and hatred inhabit the sisters, who are incapable of sympathy, and Agnes' only company and peace comes from her maid Anna. As death approaches closer, long repressed feelings of hatred, resentment and dishonesty cause jealousy, selfishness, and bitterness between the sisters that bubbles to the surface. Roger Ebert said that, To see it is to touch the extremes of human feeling. It is so personal, so penetrating of privacy; we almost want to look away. Cries and Whispers can be difficult at times to watch but it is accurate in portraying the many repressed feelings that siblings might have. The movie is profoundly deep and disturbing at the same time and in my opinion is Bergman's most powerful work. I like the theme of each sisters memories being brought up, maybe this shows the viewer that when someone else's life is going awry we immediately think of our own troubles, maybe the movie shows us that we are all capable of our own selfishness from time to time.
