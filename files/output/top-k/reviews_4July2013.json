It is certainly a lovely movie, with great performances &#x96; mainly those of Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman &#x96; and an interesting, modern remake of the original Mary Shelley novel. I particularly liked the fact that it's black and white &#x96; this helps greatly in creating the creepy and old-movie-like atmosphere. It's also quite funny, but I suggest you don't see it more than once because it might disappoint you after more viewings.The respectable doctor Frederik Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has tried for many years to cut the ties with his family, as his grandfather, the baron, had become famous for trying to reanimate dead bodies and in his opinion, his grandfather's work was crap. But after he arrives to the Transylvanian castle that belonged to his late grandfather, Frederik discovers his diary and decides to try and reanimate someone dead himself, as it appears his grandfather had succeeded. In this task, he is aided by Igor (Marty Feldman) and Inga (Teri Garr).As I said, the atmosphere in this movie is great it's all black and white, and it features mostly night scenes in the creepy Transylvanian environment, with howling wolves and fog all around. This characteristic is also very well used in some jokes. Marty Feldman is amazing as Igor, and the character himself is so funny and strange, it's delightful to watch him. Gene Wilder does an incredible job in portraying Dr. Frankenstein, especially in his madness. Peter Boyle, even though he doesn't speak most of the time since he's the monster, is very good nonetheless.This movie is also a nice homage to the old Universal movies. Unfortunately, Young Frankenstein fails as a comedy. Not horribly, but still. Some of the jokes are repetitive and not very funny, although there are some truly amusing scenes. Also, some parts are slow and boring. But considering how horrible modern spoofs are, this movie really shouldn't be bashed. I would definitely recommend watching it, especially since the first time you might just find it hilarious.Read more at http\/\/passpopcorn.wordpress.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"4 July 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Young Frankenstein is praised by many as one of the funniest movies in history.

In some of the most chilling and awe-inspiring footage, the 15-mile-wide flying saucers destroy the White House, Los Angeles, and New York City (just a few of many), with massive waves of fire washing over the streets. This is quickly followed by retaliation, with squadrons of jet fighters taking on the extraterrestrial vessels.This film crams in a lot within its two-and-a-half hour timeframe the first act takes its time to establish all the key characters as the UFOs gradually take position. When the attack begins, the action remains pretty constant, leading up to a grand final battle. Special effects were really inspiring at its time, and remain iconic to this day. Even when firestorms, alien ships, and jet fighters aren't filling up the screen, the movie runs pretty fast, with frequent comedy to keep things light and fun. Overall, it's the perfect blockbuster picture, finding a fine balance between action, spectacle, humor, and drama.The story is pretty much more of the same as any other alien invasion story you see. In fact, it bears much in common with the classic War of the Worlds. What makes ID4 more compelling, however, is that it juggles multiple characters and multiple points of views, and eventually brings them together for the central fight. All these characters are pretty fun to watch and root for, and show just enough development to make them work. The plot is pretty well-structured, using three distinct acts to portray this larger-than-life situation. It's also most noteworthy for portraying relatively realistic politics and military protocols, thanks largely to the consultation the filmmakers received from the Air Force during filming. The film also ties in a few ufology aspects to capitalize off of the popular concepts of alien life. It makes for a grand and entertaining story, even if it isn't all that deep or original.This film has very solid photography and editing. Acting is generally fun from the whole cast Bill Pullman is probably the only one who takes his role seriously, and actually comes off as a little cheesy with the way he tries so hard to sound cool and tough. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum steal the show the whole way with their lighthearted performances. Writing is pretty decent, although many lines are silly and goofy. This production spares no expense on sets, props, costumes, and special effects, although they are showing their age. David Arnold's music score is appropriately boisterous.At the time of its release, Independence Day was one of the most exciting and awe-inspiring features I had seen.

Yes, I agree that 'Deep Impact' does have its moments and emotions, but honestly, it comes nowhere near 'Armageddon'. The CGI graphics (at the end of the movie) are mediocre, very clear to see it's fake.

Nothing is mentioned about the rest of the world. Well OK, at the very end they graciously mention Europe and Africa, and that's it (Oh gee, thank you very much for thinking about us too for two seconds). Apart from that, it's America all the way.

The film is loosely based on the biographical account of Lt Col John Henry Patterson, played by Val Kilmer in the movie. Though the original story is decently written and very exciting to read, it is also clearly a work of its time, and some of the more racist undertones of the original short story has wisely been omitted from the film.Halfway through the story something very strange happens. Being at least reasonably true to Patterson's account until then, the movie transforms into a carbon copy of Jaws! Suddenly throwing aside Patterson's story and all ties to reality, fictitious character Remington is introduced, horribly portrayed by Michael Douglas. This legendary huntsman is clearly the equivalent of Jaws's Quint, but unfortunately Douglas OTT-acting doesn't even come close to matching Robert Shaw's performance.Despite the movie's obvious ambition to be a Jaws set in Africa (even down to the POV shots of the lions stalking their prey), I think lots of things work well. The ambition to emulate Jaws is at least partly successful, and the movie has some great suspenseful scenes. The extensive use of real lions Caesar and Bongo and very little animatronics means that the predator scenes look great, and I think the film benefits from being made in the mid-nineties with basically no CGI. The scenery (South Africa substituting for Kenya) looks stunning and the film is wonderfully shot, and together with the realistic animal this makes the movie look really good. The acting, apart from Douglas, is also solid with Kilmer being backed up by a strong supporting cast of Tom Wilkinson, Bernard Hill and Emily Mortimer to name a few.Overall, I have a soft spot for monster movies and even though this has many flaws I think it is really entertaining and well worth watching!

Yes , I like Wilder's Private life of Sherlock Holmes  . Yes , Levinson's Young Sherlock Holmes  was fun . Without the clue in my opinion easily beats them all . The idea here is simple , but brilliant (like the most of ideas) &#x96; what if Watson was the smart one and Holmes was an idiot ? This little movie is a great character comedy.The movie actually really feels like a SERIOUS Sherlock Holmes movie . The music , the mood , the costumes and the art-direction &#x96; everything that is needed to bring the world of Holmes from the books on the screen alive is top-notch . Look at the beginning of the movie . Until the moment when Watson begins to shout at Holmes you could be easily fooled that this is just another adaptation of Conan Doyle's books. Hell , the whole plot is done well . If they would keep the original characterizations of the characters this would be a really good normal Holmes movie . This is something I feel that was lost by both Wilder and Levinson &#x96; the soul of Sherlock Holmes world .The jokes here are simple , sometimes predictable . There are some more subtle jokes that you might miss , if you're not watching closely ( joke with the disappearing watch , joke with the violin ) . The true strength of this movie lies in the performances of Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley . I was especially surprised by Kingsley . I've never seen him in comedy before . He usually plays a rather evil and menacing characters . I've seen Caine in comedy before , so I knew he was perfectly capable to give a fine performance.Kingsley and Caine have a wonderful chemistry together that is rarely seen on screen . They can make even the simplest line of dialogue hilarious and the interaction between them is a pleasure to watch . I seriously think that without them , the whole movie wouldn't have work . The other actors give them a good support , especially Jeffrey Jones . He's perfect for the role of Lestrade . He's got one hilarious scene when he's trying to figure out what Holmes said to him &#x96; he's facial expression is worth Academy Award . Great performance. As I mentioned earlier the movie is very attractive visually and the orchestral music by Henry Mancini (famous for Pink panther theme ) fits the story very well .Overlooked and unappreciated , even now . Too bad . I give it 8\/10.

Try as I may, I cannot find reason to disagree. Every positive I find is matched by a drawback. Thunderball has no exceptional aspects to hide those flaws, and that makes them really hurt. I have pondered and analyzed this Bond movie more than any other over the years. All of those thoughts cannot be placed in one review, so I am going to stick to some of my main thoughts on the fourth James Bond movie.James Bond (Sean Connery) spends the first section of the movie at an inpatient health rehab clinic. Officers of SPECTRE, returning as the enemy after a one-movie absence, are using the same clinic to set up their next project. First, Bond discovers a murder. Then he is recalled to work when the English Prime Minister and the American President receive an extortion demand from the now nuclear armed SPECTRE. James recognizes the murdered man from a photograph in his briefing file, and embarks for Nassau to find the victim's sister (Claudine Auger). Bond soon discovers that in order to have access to her, he must deal with Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), who is also SPECTRE'S second-in-command.1) Sean Connery gives his final good performance as Bond. He carries an innate toughness and confidence along with charm and likability. Even down to his smallest mannerisms and inflections, Sean took complete ownership of the part. Bias is not the only reason he is still considered the best in the role; he earned that respect.2) The early Bond movies boasted a lineup of great villains. First came the calm genius Dr. No; second, the demanding authoritarian Rosa Klebb; and third, the ever creative Goldfinger. Largo is an acceptable villain, but falls far short of the prior three. He has his moments, such when he murders an employee for failing a mission that never had any chance of success. Overall, Largo never makes the audience feel the great authority he wields; he just comes off as smug. Part of the problem comes from the next item.3) Luciana Paluzzi plays beautiful villainess Fiona Volpe. Paluzzi's predator-in-disguise acting makes Volpe far more fearsome than Largo. Regrettably, the script tarnishes the strength of the character by making her look good through the stupidity of the male villains. Count Lippe (Guy Doleman), the lead bad guy during the clinic portion of the movie, is incompetent. Volpe is a good enough character to be taken seriously without displaying her next to Lippe's carelessness.That flaw repeats itself when Volpe turns up in Nassau. She openly rebukes Largo at one point, and then speaks to him as if she is in charge. If Largo holds the second highest rank in SPECTRE, who is she to give him orders? Largo is supposed to be more powerful than any of Bond's opponents so far.4) Felix Leiter has made nine appearances so far. In Thunderball, Leiter is his best. Goldfinger portrays Felix Leiter like a surrogate uncle to Bond. Rik Van Nutter takes over the role here. Of the six others to play Leiter, only the underused David Hedison has matched Van Nutter's sincerity. He shares an unforced chemistry with Connery. Bond and Leiter are best friends and make the perfect team, so much so that Bond reminds Leiter that he knows him better than that. It is too bad that Van Nutter only had three English speaking roles, because many movies, Bond or otherwise, would have benefited from his presence. My favorite moments in Thunderball are ones with Felix on screen.5) Approximately half of the action occurs underwater, where the photography is remarkably clear and colorful. The climax is set down there, but at over eight minutes far outstays its welcome. It soon becomes repetitive shots of two men floating in circles trying to best each other along with a few wide shots where rising air bubbles are potentially distracting. Contrast that with the Wavekrest scene in Licence to Kill, which worked perfectly because of its variety and brevity.6) The rest of the action is fine. The pre-title scene contains one of the series' most rousing and creative brawls followed by one its most delightful surprises. It is the highlight of the movie. Bond has a lot of gadgets here, and their use is dispersed well throughout. That is always a plus.7) Terence Young, an excellent director, tries to manufacture tension during times the script fails to provide it. One embarrassing scene stars a traction machine with settings ranging from Therapeutic to Homicide. As with too many other scenes, the music is more menacing than what happens on the screen. These scenes are awkward.8) Finally, the movie runs too long because it moves too slowly. No major cuts would be needed to fix that. Thunderball spends far too much time displaying the mundane. Removing ten seconds here and 15 seconds there in a dozen or so scenes would have made a giant difference without removing a single scene.Overall, Thunderball is not a bad movie. I think the term Thunderbore is unfair. Compared to From Russia with Love or Skyfall it is boring, but I never felt like I was going to lose interest. Thunderball receives a passing grade on the strength of Connery and Van Nutter, and on Young's stalwart direction. It could have been better. It also could have been much worse. I say a five out of ten is a fair number.

I know it's a little strange on 4th of July to watch this film about the corruption of the government, but this is a must see for any generation.This is absolutely a legit film, it's 3 hours long, but I never can get my eyes off of it. It's so well-directed, from the intro to the finale, just perfect. It starts with introducing John F Kennedy and the events that has happened up to the day he's getting shot, like Argo that gives a summary of the Persian history, then killing of the president and its investigation by Jim Garrison and his team, which it all leads up to revealing big controversy theories about the president's death . Oliver Stone has done such a wonderful job here; it's so obvious how much efforts he has put to tell this story accurately and truthfully. The chaos among the people, the chaos at the shooting scene, recreating the shooting scene, the flashbacks, all these are being shown so perfectly and the evidence of his hard work - I was reading that they spent $70,000 at that time just to recreate the JFK's office precisely, which only has 8seconds in the whole movie. Another great aspect of the film is whenever there's flashbacks to the shooting day, the flashbacks aren't repetitive footages, and flashbacks of the other characters are believable, in my opinion it comes from the great cast who all bring great performances, the cinematography, the editing, and even the dark dramatic soundtrack, when these flashback come on the screen, you feel being there. The screenplay has great, strong dialogues, in fact this film is filled with a lot of dialogues and narration, but these are interesting dialogues that you don't want to miss, a lot of information and materials are being exchanged among characters, and I mean a lot.

The second I hear the name Happy Gilmore (Adam Sander), I immediately think of the hockey player turned professional golfer Happy Gilmore. The screenplay in each scene describes every part extremely. The dialog is hilarious you'll be remembering these quotes for days. Every time I see him in his movie I think why I can't hit a golf ball 400 feet. That's something I could never do. Happy Gilmore finds away to hit the golf ball that far.The reason I say that is because Happy Gilmore finds out that his grandmother's house is being repossessed and finds a new hobby, golf. Happy's grandma hasn't paid her taxes in over fifty years so the government has the right to take all of her possessions. While at local golf course Chubs Peterson, an old golf pro, somehow finds Happy just to drag him into the world of golf. A classic quote that Happy says during when Chubs first meets happy while he's in a batting cage, Three hundred and sixty-four more days until next year's hockey tryouts, gotta toughen up! Then Chubs says, By god son, you're making me sick! One of the best quote's in the entire movie. He wanted this for his grandma. His grandma meant the world to him. He thought that each tournament he was in would give him money to put towards buying the house. Happy won the invitational tournament, but a lot of it was just on pure luck. He'll have to rely on luck through the entire pro tour.Throughout this, Happy Gilmore learns that as he enters into this pro tour that he's going to be introduced to his new reason to play golf. That was to beat his new rival Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Shooter McGavin was the leader in tournaments won and money earnings. People began to notice that Happy Gilmore is a character of his own. Tournaments began to be sold out every time and he started attracting people that you normal wouldn't see at a professional golfer's tour. They just want to see Happy Gilmore perform and do well along with his bizarre behavior. A long time former employer, Mr. Larson appears in one of the tournaments. He's there to cheer for Happy not Shooter. Throughout the rest of the tour Shooter is tormented by him. A quote that'll keep coming back to was what Mr. Larson says at two tournaments of which he was at and he takes Shooter McGavin's nine iron and bends it saying, Shooter haven't you forgotten your nine iron???? HAHAHAHA! At tour championship Mr. Larson shows up again but when appears there, Shooter McGavin hits the ball into the crowd. The ball all of a sudden lands on Mr. Larson's foot, he shouts, Is this your ball?! It struck my foot! Shooter asks the tour director if he can get a drop, but the tour director says that he has to play it as it lies. So Shooter hits the ball of Mr. Larson's foot, Mr. Larson says after that, That's too thus far Shooter! Shooter answers back, Oh you count? Then Mr. Larson fires back, And you can count on me waiting for you in the parking lot! The crowd goes, OOOOOOOOOO! Better run Shooter! Best part of the movie by far! Shooter McGavin decides he needs to get even with Happy Gilmore by hiring the Jackass Man to get Happy Gilmore off the tour when Happy is playing with famous television game show host, Bob Barker. Happy just needs to develop his short game to be able to beat Shooter McGavin. He realizes that he needs Chubs, so he goes back to him to work on his short game and pleads that he knows everything. The one thing he points out is he needs to find his own Happy place. His grandma is included with what he's thinking about in his happy place because she makes her grandson very happy. There's one more tournament and that's the Tour Championship, but I can't let any details about how this ends. I'll let you find out for yourself.This movie really is a movie for the ages. You'll be remembering this movie probably the rest of your life. Adam Sandler really is a character to watch for in this movie alone.

No film I have seen in the last year or so, excluding perhaps The Deer Hunter, emanates so strong a whiff of palpable, nerve-straining shock. It is, in fact, an audience reaction picture par excellence. Which explains, perhaps better than the colossal build-up, why everyone wants to see it. The public now seems to be sitting back in its seats and saying Amaze me. Alien, above all others recently, can be relied upon to do just that.AlienProduction year 1979Countries UK, USACert (UK) 18Runtime 127 minsDirectors Ridley ScottCast Ian Holm, John Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Tom SkerrittMore on this filmYet it does so, oddly enough, with a story that is basically just a mixture of The Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Thing from Outer Space. A dozen other 50s-sounding titles spring to mind &#x96; well, 60s at any rate. The point is the added 70s proficiency. You won't see anything very original anywhere in the film, other than in the actual making of it. There, no holds are barred. Scott, a recruit from advertising, where instant atmospherics has to be the order of the day, manipulates his audience in a far stronger fashion than he managed with The Duellists. His combination of space fiction and horror story is no great shakes as a work of art. Artifice, however, it has in profusion.The basics of the plot are simple. Seven astronauts, working on a battered space tug that is apparently commercially owned, touch down on another planet, find something odd for the boffins back home, bring it back into the ship and are faced with an ever-growing monster. It comes back aboard slapped across the face of poor John Hurt and ends up grinding its way through his stomach. From there on in, everyone is faced with imminent catastrophe.Scott, aided by his special effects team, headed by Brian Johnson and Nick Allder, and many others who deserve to be mentioned but can't be, creates in the confined space of his main set a sweaty little world on its own that responds ideally to his obsessive close-ups and restless, magnifying style. Hurt has said that it was more a matter of reacting than acting, and one can well understand what he means. His own performance makes one miss it when it's gone. And that of Sigourney Weaver, as one of the two women astronauts, is also consistently watchable (with a bigger slice of the cake).The others &#x96; Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright and Yaphet Kotto &#x96; do what they can faced by the swirling, well-drilled logistics of the piece. There's not enough writing for proper characterisation, not enough plot development for the mind as well as the senses to bite on. But for sheer theatricality, if one can apply that word to the cinema without insulting it, Alien is difficult to beat &#x96; even without that substance which might just have put it up there with the great movies of the genre.Some people call it a cruel, heartless and essentially exploitative opus. Something to gibber at, in fact. But Alien is not in the business of old-style family entertainment (which was, after all, often as warm and gooey as hot treacle, and about as nourishing). It bases its appeal on a different set of values. Not very enlightening ones, no doubt. But exactly in tune with much more cynical times. It deserves its success for gauging, and gorging, its audience so thoroughly. Technically a British film, it certainly shows how much talent we have in this country if only we had the courage to develop it ourselves. But that's another story, and a much less exciting one.

A dozen other 50s-sounding titles spring to mind &#x96; well, 60s at any rate. The point is the added 70s proficiency. You won't see anything very original anywhere in the film, other than in the actual making of it. There, no holds are barred. Scott, a recruit from advertising, where instant atmospherics has to be the order of the day, manipulates his audience in a far stronger fashion than he managed with The Duellists. His combination of space fiction and horror story is no great shakes as a work of art. Artifice, however, it has in profusion.The basics of the plot are simple. Seven astronauts, working on a battered space tug that is apparently commercially owned, touch down on another planet, find something odd for the boffins back home, bring it back into the ship and are faced with an ever-growing monster. It comes back aboard slapped across the face of poor John Hurt and ends up grinding its way through his stomach. From there on in, everyone is faced with imminent catastrophe.Scott, aided by his special effects team, headed by Brian Johnson and Nick Allder, and many others who deserve to be mentioned but can't be, creates in the confined space of his main set a sweaty little world on its own that responds ideally to his obsessive close-ups and restless, magnifying style. Hurt has said that it was more a matter of reacting than acting, and one can well understand what he means. His own performance makes one miss it when it's gone. And that of Sigourney Weaver, as one of the two women astronauts, is also consistently watchable (with a bigger slice of the cake).The others &#x96; Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright and Yaphet Kotto &#x96; do what they can faced by the swirling, well-drilled logistics of the piece. There's not enough writing for proper characterisation, not enough plot development for the mind as well as the senses to bite on. But for sheer theatricality, if one can apply that word to the cinema without insulting it, Alien is difficult to beat &#x96; even without that substance which might just have put it up there with the great movies of the genre.Some people call it a cruel, heartless and essentially exploitative opus. Something to gibber at, in fact. But Alien is not in the business of old-style family entertainment (which was, after all, often as warm and gooey as hot treacle, and about as nourishing). It bases its appeal on a different set of values. Not very enlightening ones, no doubt. But exactly in tune with much more cynical times. It deserves its success for gauging, and gorging, its audience so thoroughly. Technically a British film, it certainly shows how much talent we have in this country if only we had the courage to develop it ourselves. But that's another story, and a much less exciting one.

No film I have seen in the last year or so, excluding perhaps The Deer Hunter, emanates so strong a whiff of palpable, nerve-straining shock. It is, in fact, an audience reaction picture par excellence. Which explains, perhaps better than the colossal build-up, why everyone wants to see it.

And, yes, I've always looked upon Exorcist Steps and been shaken without ever knowing the specifics. So now I know this movie goes beyond spinning heads, bloody crucifixes and projectile pea soup.Now the film opens flat (and in Iraq of all places) and the mythology which should have been teased, was more hinted and poorly executed. In the Omen,. that is the core of the movie. How can you have a movie about demonic possession without knowing the who, what, when, where and why scenarios? We meet a Mother and Daughter who slowly become to realize that something is seriously wrong. Along with the troubled past and present of our Priest psychiatrist, two-thirds of our story seems to be on track.We morph into a terrifying movie that shows our medical gods as unknowing witch doctors practicing medicine as if they were willing gamblers who know no odds. The brain scan scenes were absolutely horrifying! As we approach the exorcism, the scariest part is not knowing what well find every time we open the 12 year odds bedroom door.That's great storytelling!The actual 9 minute exorcism is our reward and final fireworks creep show at which end I was relieved the demon was gone as it had found a place in my home (in my fearful mind) ever since little Regan started mouthing off and cursing at the doctors.That was no coincidence that the possession took place as a girl was becoming a teenager. What's going on with my kid? is a typical parental thought leading to more horrific ones at times. Overall, I will wonder why I waited so long, where will those previously mentioned thoughts re-occur in my life, when will I see this again, who will watch with me and how did such an eerie tune as Tubular Bells no be more prominent in the movie itself? 60 seconds at best... That song is more mythology inducing than the first 20 minutes, but the rest froze me on the couch in absolute terror f what was coming next.
