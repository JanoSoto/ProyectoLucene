[{"date":"24 June 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Wachowski brothers Andy and Lana create this mesmerizing sci-fi action film with awesome up the ass visual effects, solid editing, and an excellent cast. Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishbourne make a great team as two righteous individuals who go on a journey into another world, as they travel to the extent of visuals unimaginable.Keanu Reeves stars as a computer hacker named Neo who goes through a weird series of incidents, and wines up in a different dimensional world with a mysterious man named Morpheus, along with a group of other people, as he learns the truth about mankind, and is shown a whole other world beyond the eyes.Entertains you from beginning to end in a very bad ass way. Acting performances aren't the best, along with the slanted story due to the visuals, but doesn't bother you the least bit, if not just for a little bit. Your too concentrated on the stunning visuals, and the terrific editing, which is probably where this movie does best.Although it takes awhile for the action to start, its all worth it when it finally kicks off, with insane action scenes that will get you all pumped up. Clever choreography, with fighting techniques, as well as shooting scenes included. Sound effects are awesome, and go great with the action.I could go on forever, but in short, the visuals, action scenes, and editing are the three best things to look for in this film.
