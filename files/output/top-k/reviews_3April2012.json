[{"date":"3 April 2012","score":"","review":" After the release of Toy Story in 1995, 3-D animation took over, and 2-D animation slowly began to fade...which is a shame, because one of the 2-D films that got over shadowed was the 1999 film, The Iron Giant. Not only is it an animated masterpiece, it is one of my favorite films of all time. Whenever I bring it up in a conversation (even to this day), people have no idea what I'm talking about; which is unacceptable. So what do I love about this film? Well....everything. I love the 1950's setting, I love how it pays homage to the atomic age of cinema, I love the characters, I love the emotion, I love adult tone to it, I love the music, the animation, the message, and...I love that it's not Disney. This movie has such a natural and balanced build to it, that I don't think most Disney films at the time could achieve. Everything about this movie just feels very natural, and the characters act\/react in a way that feels real, and not so cartoon like. The emotions this film conveys are also very natural, and doesn't seem to go overboard. Most Disney films of the 90's had moments where the film was telling you Feel sad here, or laugh now. The Iron Giant has sad moments and funny moments, but they're not shoved in your face. The Iron Giant didn't have any musical numbers, cute little animals, or an over the top comic relief, but so what? To me, those kinds of things dumb down the film (not always) and weakens it in the long run. The Iron Giant didn't need any of those kid movie gimmicks; and the result is a kids movie that gets better with age. It's a shame that this movie didn't get the same attention as films like The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast, because to me, it really is one of the best 2-D animated films of all time. it is highly underrated, i highly recommend it, check it out.

Stanley Kubrick admitted The Godfather may very well be the greatest movie ever made and without a doubt has the best cast. If two of the greatest directors of all time had claimed such statement, what more needs to be said about this masterpiece, really? By now, it's already a stuff of legend. Countless lists and people have rated this as the finest motion picture to ever grace the silver screen. The genre and cinema itself have been heavily influenced by the contents in the movie, and even real-life mafias mimicked how Don Vito Corleone, portrayed by Marlon Brando in what I consider to be the most splendid acting job done by any actor or actress in any movie ever, carried himself. When did you ever hear something like that happened? If there was ever any? I doubt Francis Ford Coppola himself would have thought his first big directorial job would have given birth to an enduring legacy THIS big. Sure, he had Marlon Brando in his pocket, complete with Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, James Caan, and Robert Duvall as future stars just to name a few, which must have been exciting for a young director for that time. But I still doubt Coppola would have known he was directing the greatest motion picture of the 20th century even once during the entire 62 days of shooting, even when he, the entire casts, and the entire crews gave it their all for those 62 days. But that magic was there. And it is now known throughout the world as The Godfather.I think the story is rather famous now, but I'll say it anyway. It tells the story of an organized crime family after the World War II was over. Spanning over 10 years, the movie was a journey of the youngest son (played brilliantly by the legendary Al Pacino) transformed from a war hero not wanting to have anything to do with his family's business to become the next head of an organized crime dynasty.It featured brilliant performances from every single person involved, especially the mythical Marlon Brando. Every scene he was in, no way you didn't have your eyes on him. Even when he wasn't around, you would still feel his presence and power. His character, to me at least, made this movie. No one could play him as grand as Marlon Brando did.On technical aspect, this movie is flawless. Coppola's directing really captured the quintessence of every character in the movie. The dark photography added to the whole mystique of every scene in this movie. And the last but definitely not the least, the score is magical.What else is there need to be said about this masterpiece? Only a few movie can be called perfection, The Godfather is a prime example of it. Everything in this movie is so unbelievably perfect it is almost unreal. How come something became this great is hard to decipher. This timeless classic is a definite must see for anyone. And among many movies made in the 20th century I have seen, this is the best of the best. The finest of the finest. Maybe several movies can come close, but I don't think anything can top this. I firmly believe The Godfather is without a doubt the most brilliant motion picture of the 20th century.

For someone very familiar with the hero's journey (I used to read a lot of fantasy novels as a kid), this movie had little new to offer. I don't have a problem with this tried-and-true story structure, but the movie just didn't do a particularly good job of executing it.While the basic motivation for the plot (a wish gone awry, more or less) has good potential for a story, the goblin king seems a little too wooden for the setup to really be convincing. Does he actually want to keep the child, or is his real intention to give the heroine a test of character? It seems like the answer is neither. He repeatedly professes dismay at Sarah's progress, yet does little to stop her and seems to be strangely uninterested in what's happening. Bowie certainly looked the part but I think his uninflected portrayal failed to be compelling overall.Another thing I thought was problematic was the lack of real threat in the story. Throughout the movie, the heroine encounters trials such as getting lost, falling in a hole, and having to cross a bad-smelling swamp. I understand the movie was geared towards children, but I think the level of menace and dramatic tension could have been increased without making the movie too family-unfriendly. After all, kids already know fear. There are certainly things I fear as an adult, but nothing can equal my childhood terror at the thought of raccoons (don't laugh), terrible creatures of the darkness that invaded our yard to shatter our illusions of suburban security and raid our trash cans. But I digress. My point is, the challenges faced by the heroine seem pretty tame even by kids' movie standards.The final abyss was especially weak. Rather than a climactic scene in which the heroine has to confront her own inner demons, she instead has to overcome... Escherian staircases? Then she struggles to remember a monologue (as the main antagonist waits patiently) and finally triumphs when she utters the last line You have no power over me. Well, that's all well and good, but it really could have been a lot better. (Even Bartholomew and the Oobleck had a more exciting climax, and in that story the main antagonist was inclement weather!)Still, the movie had some good messages about responsibility and growing up, the power of friendship and kindness, and so on.

She made her name in a series of popular comedies centred around Squibs, a Piccadilly flower seller. Soon she was the most popular screen star in Britain, popular enough to be given the lead in Champagne directed by up and coming director Alfred Hitchcock. He attempted this as a change of pace from his more recent, somber films (The Lodger (1927) and The Ring (1927)) but Hitchcock didn't like it. Obviously with Miss Balfour as the star, the film was tailored to her light hearted talent and Hitchcock was out of his element and refused to mold a film around a particular personality ever again.

It is honestly creepy, bluntly engrossing and steam powered by a great character and an equally accomplished performance. This is one of those movies where you're waiting for it to suck and instead, it keeps getting better.If I told you this film was about a tabloid reporter chasing after a vampire who wears a full-on Dracula outfit, complete with cape, and pilots a tiny, prop-engine plane from small town airport to small town airport, feasting on the middle-aged and elderly&#x85;admit it. That sounds like the premise of a horror parody, doesn't it? I mean, a real vampire who dresses like a Bela Lugosi impersonator? And he doesn't fly by turning into a bat, but by strapping himself into the cockpit of something that looks like a pair of wings got slapped onto a VW hippie van? And he sucks the blood, not from nubile lasses but from members of AARP? Does that sound scary to you?And yet, The Night Flier is one of the more genuinely entertaining horror films I've ever seen. Largely, that's due to the central character of Richard Dees and the snarling integrity Miguel Ferrer gives him. Dees is a veteran reporter for the sort of tabloid rag that wallows in blood, scandal and outrage of all kind. He is also one of the most unrelenting pricks in the history of cinema and Ferrer fills Dees to bursting with insolent, impotent distemper. He has nothing but contempt for all the other people of the world and their delicate sensitivities. Dees is such a thorough-going bastard and Ferrer is so unflinching in his portrayal that the character blasts through any viewer enmity and becomes an admirable figure. You wouldn't want to be sitting next to a son of a bitch like Dees in a bar, but he's exactly the sort of man you want trying to uncover difficult and ugly truths. And whether Dees is jousting with his wickedly jaded editor (Dan Monahan) and a perky female reporter (Julie Entwisle) or slowing unraveling the mystery of The Night Flier, you can't take your eyes off him.If you're looking for non-stop gore, flesh being shredded and disgusting perversion, you'll not find it here. The language is R-rated but the violence is no worse than what can be seen on most network TV cop procedural shows. The emphasis is on suspense and the smoldering anger of Richard Dees. The plot is also pretty simple, with Dees following in the footsteps of The Night Flier until he finally catches up to him.

It is honestly creepy, bluntly engrossing and steam powered by a great character and an equally accomplished performance. This is one of those movies where you're waiting for it to suck and instead, it keeps getting better.If I told you this film was about a tabloid reporter chasing after a vampire who wears a full-on Dracula outfit, complete with cape, and pilots a tiny, prop-engine plane from small town airport to small town airport, feasting on the middle-aged and elderly&#x85;admit it. That sounds like the premise of a horror parody, doesn't it? I mean, a real vampire who dresses like a Bela Lugosi impersonator? And he doesn't fly by turning into a bat, but by strapping himself into the cockpit of something that looks like a pair of wings got slapped onto a VW hippie van? And he sucks the blood, not from nubile lasses but from members of AARP? Does that sound scary to you?And yet, The Night Flier is one of the more genuinely entertaining horror films I've ever seen. Largely, that's due to the central character of Richard Dees and the snarling integrity Miguel Ferrer gives him. Dees is a veteran reporter for the sort of tabloid rag that wallows in blood, scandal and outrage of all kind. He is also one of the most unrelenting pricks in the history of cinema and Ferrer fills Dees to bursting with insolent, impotent distemper. He has nothing but contempt for all the other people of the world and their delicate sensitivities. Dees is such a thorough-going bastard and Ferrer is so unflinching in his portrayal that the character blasts through any viewer enmity and becomes an admirable figure. You wouldn't want to be sitting next to a son of a bitch like Dees in a bar, but he's exactly the sort of man you want trying to uncover difficult and ugly truths. And whether Dees is jousting with his wickedly jaded editor (Dan Monahan) and a perky female reporter (Julie Entwisle) or slowing unraveling the mystery of The Night Flier, you can't take your eyes off him.If you're looking for non-stop gore, flesh being shredded and disgusting perversion, you'll not find it here. The language is R-rated but the violence is no worse than what can be seen on most network TV cop procedural shows. The emphasis is on suspense and the smoldering anger of Richard Dees. The plot is also pretty simple, with Dees following in the footsteps of The Night Flier until he finally catches up to him.

I could use so many superlatives to describe it but watching Milestone's war\/epic left me cold with all the self- glorification and enthusiasm that only serves as a desire to hide the awareness of our own mediocrity. I will only say that All Quiet on the Western Front is a masterpiece because it's the first movie to make a political statement, and a courageous one, not pacifist but humanistic. If only for that, Milestone's film is a milestone on the field of cinematic intelligence.This story is neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped shells, were destroyed by the war.If not an accusation, it does admit that a generation was destroyed. If not a confession, the film demonstrates that it takes war to realize life's value just as it takes jail to value freedom. And if not an adventure, it still conveys the strange exhilarating feeling of an escape from the world's lies and politicians' vanity, to reach a point where people can become fully themselves, as said Louis-Ferdinand Celine, a French WWI veteran and author Our youth has gone to the ends of the earth to die in the silence of the truth in 'Journey to the End of the Night'.More than an accusation, confession or adventure, the story is a tribute to a lost generation, the year of the release is even more significant because those who survived the War were not only alive, but young enough to have kept intact memories. All Quiet on the Western Front is a tribute to a youth sacrificed by greed, profit and patriotic glory in the altar of trenches, where every mile cost thousands of bodies. The film starts with boys whose eyes harangued by the patriotic speech of their school professor, burn with the intensely proud flame to fight in the name of Germany and desire of victory... and eventually to leave school. The first bombing will shatter all these beliefs, as they'll understand that whether you fight for French Motherland of German Fatherland, Mother Earth is the ultimate destination.Most of the actors were not professional except for the extraordinary performance of Louis Wolheim as Kat, a mentor for the boys and for us. The actors were as inexperienced and youthful, as the boys who were listed and criticizing the acting on that level is like stamping on an ant when you can admire its strength the cast embodies the tragedy of a War that dug a big hole in a whole generation. The last shot of the boys walking and turning their faces at us, juxtaposed with the sight of a mortuary, is like a warning for the years to come. But history taught us war is indeed a fever that just strikes everybody, nobody wants it until it happens and everybody wants it until they make it.It's only at war that the soldiers can question its meaning, its origin, and only at war that the ranks, medals and protocols make no difference whatsoever. The most zealous drill sergeant starts sobbing at the first shell wheezing, highlighting one of war's few consolations to reveal the true value of people in life and make everyone equal in death. In a powerful scene, Paul, the central character stabs for the first time a French soldier, and as he spends some time hidden with the body, he talks to him and realizes that they're both comrades, brothers, victims of the same political vanity and full of the same desire to live. All that separates them is a uniform, and to Death, even uniforms don't make a damn difference. The merit of All Quiet on the Western Front is to be told from German perspective, from the enemy, the other, and what better lesson for empathy than inviting an audience to comprehend that the other side, like in Das Boot for WWII, shared the same trauma? And Milestone's film renders the most horrific aspects of war without any other special effects than an extraordinary editing and directing. 68 years before Saving Private Ryan's iconic opening, Milestone showed soldiers hit by a volley of machine-gun fire, falling but with such a fast-paced directing that we never see them hitting the ground. Some shot show shadowy soldiers jumping from below as to suggest a human submersion, the atrocities and pointlessness of War never seemed so raw and real as in All Quiet on the Western Front, because it showed what a slaughter World War I was, whether Spielberg's point was only to show that the second one was a good war.When the few survivors came back to their hometown, they realize that the attitude and the enthusiasm toward the war were unchanged. Civilians and military, Family, the teacher, the boys in the classroom didn't learn anything. And our bodies are earth, and our thoughts are clay, and we sleep and eat with death! says Paul but he only receives insults and incomprehension. But he knows, and we know from his experience that he's the one who owns the truth, because in his mind are all his friends dead in the trenches, in the battlefield, in a lousy hospital. But the tragedy of life is that as usual, it's not the dead but the living that need to be awakened.

It is perhaps less flashy compared to other Bond flicks but it's certainly not lacking in coolness. There are the larger than life action sequences, cool gadgets and hot babes. However, unlike much of the other Bond flicks, especially those of the 80s, where the characters were caricatures, the women were mere sex objects who succumbed to Bond's charm and Bond himself was the typical action hero and the stories were thin on plot, 'Licence to Kill' is a lot more layered. 'License To Kill' is more story driven. Here the story is more about revenge than the typical spy mission.To start with, the characters are truer to Ian Fleming's creation. There are several references to Bond's pass. Timothy Dalton's Bond shows a lot more depth than Roger Moore's. I'm not criticizing Moore here but merely pointing out how differently their roles were written. I wouldn't have thought of Dalton as the ideal choice for James but after seeing this, I can say that the actor easily carries the role. Luminous Carey Lowell's Pam, the bond heroine, is far from the bimbo whose task is either to seduce or be seduced. She makes for a very good Bond counterpart. Talisa Soto is supersexy but she too is given more to do than show skin (even though she does offer a modest dose). Then there's Robert Davi who makes for a fine villain and Benicio Del Toro is hilarious (mostly unintentionally).'License to Kill' is quite a well made film. The execution is subtle compared to other Bond films. There's some wonderful cinematography, action scenes, editing and light. The exotic locations are stunning to look at and the energetic score flows exceptionally well.This is perhaps the most under-appreciated Bond film.

In such a lengthy pretitle sequence, the film tricks us into thinking that she will be the focus of this film, before pulling the rug out from underneath the viewers' feet and brutally killing off her character 20 minutes into the film. The real heroine is not introduced until about 30 minutes into the film, when we are taken back to the shores of Crystal Lake, where another group of people are attempting to open another summer camp on the opposite shores of the lake, five years after the events of the first film. A lull in action while we're introduced to the current group of victims-to-be is quickly forgotten when the carnage begins again. But who is to blame this time? Jason's mother again? Or did the little goofball grow up and follow in his demented mother's footsteps? Its unusual structure is uneven it has a 20-minutes long pretitle sequence; followed by a joke sequence involving a two truck; but then a lengthy lull in action while we're introduced to the characters, before kicking back into gear for the second half- but then a letdown with a pointless, nonsensical ending (jumping through a window, possibly stolen from Phantasm?) marring an otherwise great horror flick. The film should have ended just as Ginny and Paul walked out of the shack Jason lived in.But the good outweighs the bad in this film, and I think it manages to top the first film. The writers tried to get a bit psychological here, with the heroine hypothesizing about what made Jason's mother kill, and what Jason would be like if he had lived- it was an interesting twist. The seemingly higher budget also helps, as does better photography, and more attempts at suspense in between the bloodletting. The characters are not as obnoxious as in a lot of other slashers, which is also works in the film's favour. My favourite scene has a boneheaded cop chasing Jason into the woods, and stumbling onto, and into, Jason's house.

Or did the little goofball grow up and follow in his demented mother's footsteps? Its unusual structure is uneven it has a 20-minutes long pretitle sequence; followed by a joke sequence involving a two truck; but then a lengthy lull in action while we're introduced to the characters, before kicking back into gear for the second half- but then a letdown with a pointless, nonsensical ending (jumping through a window, possibly stolen from Phantasm?) marring an otherwise great horror flick. The film should have ended just as Ginny and Paul walked out of the shack Jason lived in.But the good outweighs the bad in this film, and I think it manages to top the first film. The writers tried to get a bit psychological here, with the heroine hypothesizing about what made Jason's mother kill, and what Jason would be like if he had lived- it was an interesting twist. The seemingly higher budget also helps, as does better photography, and more attempts at suspense in between the bloodletting. The characters are not as obnoxious as in a lot of other slashers, which is also works in the film's favour. My favourite scene has a boneheaded cop chasing Jason into the woods, and stumbling onto, and into, Jason's house.

However, in this movie he moves away from those themes and instead offers a plot that is not only humorous but deals with themes that can resonate with any audience. The story shows what how people can make a lot of half-baked decisions when their thinking is muddled. These decisions can cause a lot of damage and destroy friendships. For instance, Allen lauds the island of Manhattan while at the same time including scene after scene of a city that is grimy, dark, foreboding, and unfriendly, evidence of the kind of conflictual perceptions that mark the thinking of all of the characters. Filming the movie in black and white adds to the sense of emotional disconnection; there is simply nothing beautiful or charming about the city. The panoramic vistas are impressive but cold and foreboding, yet this is the venue where all the characters function. This movie contains what is probably Diane Keaton's greatest performance. She is clearly the star of the movie. If anyone has any doubt as to her talent as an actress, this movie will dispel those doubts. In this movie, Woody Allen is attempting to make a statement about the human condition and succeeds. This movie shows that people can hurt one another without meaning to do so and that the quest for personal happiness is a difficult road.

There's precious little in ways of scares, originality or surprises, but it does have a couple of decent deaths that don't seem to suffer given Tom Savini's absence. The most memorable being someone being hacked clean in half whilst hand-standing. The third entry into the long franchise is better remembered for being the film that introduced Jason's hockey mask, which is now a well-recognised piece of pop culture. I was never expecting anything great here, and while it is formulaic, predictable, and often very dull, it's still an easy 90 minutes of slasher entertainment.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"3 April 2012","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Carrying on the Friday the 13th tradition, Part III is yet another re- run of the events of the first film, only using different actors and character names.
