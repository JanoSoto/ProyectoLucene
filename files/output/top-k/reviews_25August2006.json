[{"date":"25 August 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Will Patton, and Ving Rhames star in one of the best movies I've seen all year. Sean Connery is Robert MacDougal a jewel thief; Catherine Zeta-Jones is Virginia Gin Baker, an insurance investigator sent to capture him. As Entrapment evolved, it became apparent that not everything is what it seems.Entrapment is a movie that people will enjoy as it will keep them on the edge of their seats and keep them guessing whether or not certain characters are on the level. The plot includes trying to capture Robert MacDougal while he tries his hand at a theft of mask. The movie doesn't end there, not only does it have one robbery but there a two; the second is an offer by a mystery person who can only be revealed when it is seen.I was kept guessing throughout to who might be on the level, wondering who might be the real thief. Along with the suspense, Entrapment includes underlying but clear sexual tension and incredible chemistry between Connery and Zeta-Jones.Also, Entrapment was enjoyable due to the many high-tech gadgets, which were used by Connery and Zeta-Jones. One scene in particular was very enjoyable as it involved Zeta-Jones in sensual positions. It seems like Connery's character was a father figure for Zeta-Jones and was proved in several scenes throughout the film.Entrapment also includes great support from its co-stars Will Patton and Ving Rhames. Patton and Rhames are so good it is difficult to tell whether or not they are part of a conspiracy to steal the mask or they are really tracking Connery and Zeta-Jones.This is a movie for people who like a good suspenseful thriller that will make them think and doesn't have a resolution until the end. Furthermore, it contained a surprise ending that will the audience will enjoy.

As Darby O'Gill and the Little People is a Disney movie set in Ireland, we have to admit that it basically makes a series of stereotypes about the Emerald Isle - namely all the leprechaun stuff - and can probably only appeal to little children. My favorite parts were actually the scenes of the Banshee; Darby really could have used the Ghostbusters there.So, if we can understand what the movie's portraying, maybe we can appreciate it. But given the ever-present situation in Northern Ireland, it just seems inappropriate to happily depict that island as a bunch of jolly leprechauns. As for the wee people themselves, my two favorite representations of them were the Porky Pig cartoon Wearing of the Grin and the horror movie Leprechaun (starring Jennifer Aniston).I know, you probably find it a little weird that I reviewed a Disney movie and mentioned stereotypes, the Ghostbusters, England's continued occupation of Northern Ireland, Porky Pig and Jennifer Aniston. Sorry folks, but the 21st century judges all previous history. Therefore, I judge DOATLP based on what I know about, and based on what has happened since the movie's release.Yeah, when this movie came out, who would have guessed that the young man would go on to play a hunky British agent who goes around bedding the world's hottest babes? And what if someone extended the last name to O'Gilligan? Now that would make some three-hour tour!
