Lee makes other inspired casting choices in this film with then named Larry Fishburn, Bill Nunn, Ginocarlo Espasito, Tisia Cambell, and an early, early appearance by Sam L.

Then, when they decided to make the rest of the movies, everyone was drooling and losing their minds over it. I just never felt the urge to go see any. So, anyway, a few weekends ago, I borrowed all six from my friend and watched them over a period of a week, or so. Now that I'm finished, I must say that I am a little bit disappointed. Maybe I missed the boat (or train, or bus, or wagon or whatever means of transport that Star Wars buffs take), but I just wasn't as engrossed in the characters as I hoped I would.I do realize that this movie has a cult following, and I will no doubt be bashed by a lot of the weaker minds here at IMDb; but, my original point still stands I think the Star Wars series is good, but a bit overrated.I loved the last (or first) three movies that were put out. No, not because of superior special effects, but, I think the story was easier to digest and the acting was far superior (some scenes in the earlier movies were actually quite comical in their clumsiness). I think maybe the characters in the early movies threw me off the series (Luke's character wasn't really lovable as the hero).Overall, the idea of two trilogies was genius and both sets of movies could stand on their own.

The second two-thirds definitely falter in terms of losing the tension of the first part and having to try and explain some of the proceedings in less than convincing fashion - but overall this film rises above(slightly) the other films of its ilk with a bit more something.

Watch for Eileen Brennan as the cat lady in a small but memorable role. The story is - to be real honest - ridiculous. It has to do with some creature that feeds on fear and uses...well, can't go into too much detail without giving away some major information about the end. The creature is real creepy, especially in the early scenes as he pushes his truck, for apparently no reason, into the back end of the car of the two young kids. Later, the kids see him throwing what looks like bodies in body bags down a drain pipe in an old country churchyard. They see him leave and do what nobody in his\/her right mind would do - investigate. What they find is a cavernous room filled with bloodied bodies adorning the walls and floor like some chapel of evil. Things then get dicey when the creepy man comes back. This part of the film is the major strength of this film. It has style, a meteoric pace of tension and surprise and is ever so chilling. Little explanation is needed. As the film builds and explanation IS needed, the film falters and begins to tumult to a lack of credibility. But it does manage to retain some of the style and pace earlier exhibited.

No.Silence has been used well, the silence in the eyes of Forrest Gump. There's something rather powerful about his expressionless face. It can emote comedy, unconventional charisma but above all, a deep sense of sadness. I know this a rather bold statement that would raise a lot of argument but just for the sake of Forrest Gump and my love for this film, I can safely be abrasive and say Tom Hanks gave the best performance for a male ever in a lead role. I do not know whether I should commend the direction, or the screenplay, or the background music and screenplay because all I remember of when I think of this film, is Tom Hanks and that look on his face.Forrest Gump is special. In a weird way,I would like to think every movie watcher relates to this story. It also manages to nail all emotions. When I watched this film for the first time, I thought about it for a week. With every new person, I meet in my daily life, or date, there always is a conversation about forrest gump. And I like mentioning to them how I lock my doors while watching this film because I wouldn't want anybody rushing to see me.The awkwardness in his actions, is similar to that of the character Edward (played by Depp) in a film called Edward Scissorhands.

There are just too many fine actors and top notch performances contained in this film for it to be anything but outstanding. Howard Hawks knows just how to harness this story and give each actor room enough to strut his stuff.John Wayne plays a hired gun who comes to the aid of a drunken sheriff played to perfection by Robert Mitchum. By Wayne's side is a young man (James Caan) packing a nasty scatter-gun, and also at their disposal is a grizzled Indian fighter deputy (Arthur Hunnicutt). The four do battle with an evil land owner (Ed Asner), his hired gun (Christopher George), and several other gunslingers looking for trouble. A rival family of landowners named the MacDonalds are being pressured by Asner and his cronies. Wayne and Co. take their side, and all hell breaks loose in El Dorado.The film is crisply paced, well-written, and the acting as good as you might expect. Even actors like Caan and Asner who might seem out of their element fit right in and hold their own. Wayne is as watchable as ever. It's a treat just to hear him say the word Mississippi every time he refers to Caan. Mitchum has the more demanding of the two lead roles, and it's no wonder Wayne wanted that role for himself. The toughest thing our heroes are faced with is sobering him up as he has become the laughing stock of the town he is supposed to protect. Arthur Hunnicutt, as Mitchum's deputy, seems to get a lot of the good lines and more than proves his worth when things get tough. Another person who stands out is Michele Carey who portrays one of the MacDonald clan. I'd never really heard of her before, but the woman is stunningly beautiful. She plays a resourceful woman out to kick some Asner butt.Between the numerous shootouts, there are wonderful scenes where you can tell the stars are just happy to stand together in front of the camera. There are a few scenes that really weren't beaten to death by the genre and actually look original. A shootout involving church bells was something I hadn't seen before, though I'm hardly an expert in western lore. I wouldn't be surprised to find that someone had done it before, but it really worked in this film. Also, it was neat to see Caan blow some of the bad guys to shreds with his shotgun. That was an under-utilized weapon in old western films. His brief impersonation of a Chinaman is bound to offend some, but it's actually quite entertaining.If you love a good western, you must not miss El Dorado. Even if you don't normally watch them, you might also find it more than worth your time.9 of 10 stars.The Hound.

Arthur Hunnicutt, as Mitchum's deputy, seems to get a lot of the good lines and more than proves his worth when things get tough. Another person who stands out is Michele Carey who portrays one of the MacDonald clan. I'd never really heard of her before, but the woman is stunningly beautiful. She plays a resourceful woman out to kick some Asner butt.Between the numerous shootouts, there are wonderful scenes where you can tell the stars are just happy to stand together in front of the camera. There are a few scenes that really weren't beaten to death by the genre and actually look original. A shootout involving church bells was something I hadn't seen before, though I'm hardly an expert in western lore. I wouldn't be surprised to find that someone had done it before, but it really worked in this film. Also, it was neat to see Caan blow some of the bad guys to shreds with his shotgun. That was an under-utilized weapon in old western films. His brief impersonation of a Chinaman is bound to offend some, but it's actually quite entertaining.If you love a good western, you must not miss El Dorado.

There are just too many fine actors and top notch performances contained in this film for it to be anything but outstanding. Howard Hawks knows just how to harness this story and give each actor room enough to strut his stuff.John Wayne plays a hired gun who comes to the aid of a drunken sheriff played to perfection by Robert Mitchum. By Wayne's side is a young man (James Caan) packing a nasty scatter-gun, and also at their disposal is a grizzled Indian fighter deputy (Arthur Hunnicutt). The four do battle with an evil land owner (Ed Asner), his hired gun (Christopher George), and several other gunslingers looking for trouble. A rival family of landowners named the MacDonalds are being pressured by Asner and his cronies. Wayne and Co. take their side, and all hell breaks loose in El Dorado.The film is crisply paced, well-written, and the acting as good as you might expect. Even actors like Caan and Asner who might seem out of their element fit right in and hold their own. Wayne is as watchable as ever. It's a treat just to hear him say the word Mississippi every time he refers to Caan. Mitchum has the more demanding of the two lead roles, and it's no wonder Wayne wanted that role for himself.

Masterfully directed by Danny Steinmann, it is a supremely entertaining exploitation slasher film. The most common reasons given seem to be (a) there's not enough gore (b) the story is stupid\/the acting isn't very good (c) Jason isn't in the movie. Of course, none of these explanations is valid. First of all, if gore alone is your litmus test to determine whether or not a film is enjoyable, you should probably steer clear of the entire Friday The 13th series, as well as any movie that has been subjected to the wacky ratings system and experienced a wide theatrical release. Go watch&#133; I don't know&#133; a Guinea Pig film. A New Beginning has as much gore as any of the Friday films. If a strong plot and acting of the highest caliber is important to you&#133; well, let's be honest, criticizing A New Beginning for its silly plot is like dismissing Van Gogh because you don't like the color yellow. You're missing the point. Yes, I sort of understand the complaint that Jason isn't in the movie, as he is my favorite of the classic maniacs. (Cropsy, Marty, Michael Meyers, and Angela round out the top five.) But his absence alone shouldn't ruin the whole movie for you. I'd rather watch an entertaining movie that alludes to, yet doesn't feature the actual Jason, as opposed to a boring movie that completely screws up his mythology. (Here's a clue. It comes after VIII and before X.)Friday The 13th Part V A New Beginning works because it takes the elements that make a good slasher film and completely exaggerates them. All irony aside, A New Beginning is a trashy, sleazy, exploitative masterpiece. The very premise of having Jason hack up a group of mentally-ill teens, which includes two nymphomaniacs, an angry sociopath, a chocolate loving man child, a new-wave goth who likes to dance, and a stutterer, is indicative of the sick-minded, oozy greatness of this movie. Jesus, I haven't even touched upon the mother-son hillbilly biker duo or Demon! This movie has more great characters than the entire Halloween series combined! Are you not entertained by Demon in his sh*tbox singing Oooh, Oooh, Baby&#133;. Oooh, Oooh, Baby to his sexy girlfriend before being impaled? How could this be? Are you made of stone? Are you? Do you not enjoy watching Violet, who is the most uniquely attractive female in the entire Friday series, do the robot to Pseudo Echo before being killed? I love her with all my heart. What about Ethel and Junior, the most vile, hate-filled, loony hating hicks to ever interact with a stained voyeur-drifter? Junior's decapitation, after being pummeled by Tommy following a prank which consisted of shining a light in his eyes, is a fitting end for the angry dullard. Oh, and Vic? The greatest red herring in slasher history. He violently kills Joey after the overweight stereotype accuses him of being out of line. Harsh words from a strange man! The number of kills in this movie dwarf the previous Friday record. (Subsequent sequels had more, but, with the exception of Jason X&#133; another unjustly maligned classic&#133; not by much.) The fact that most of these kills are peripheral to the story, unnecessary, and hilarious only adds to their quality. Case in point, the hideously obnoxious, cocaine-addicted mental health worker Billy who picks up Lana the waitress at the diner. She who proceeds to get naked while saying It's showtime! to herself in the mirror. You don't see the entertainment value in that, my friends? Following this odd display, a cat bafflingly drops from above and bounces clumsily and hard off a booth. It was a cheap shock and laugh at the same time! Shortly thereafter, Billy and Lana are both killed with enough blood to make it all worthwhile. That entire scene is mesmerizing. And let's not forget the two jerks with the broken down car who appear earlier in the film. They're greasers! Greasers! I watch slasher films not for genuine scares or insightful twists, but to be entertained. And I am usually entertained by their exploitative depths, bloody action, nudity, uniquely stupid characters, and the basest nihilism of it all. I simply cannot see how anyone could argue A New Beginning doesn't contain every single one of these qualities in excess. It's a sleazy, vicious, offensive slasher that epitomizes everything that makes the genre popular. The time has come to re-evaluate this amazing film and give Steinmann the credit he deserves.

It mostly just consisted of Clint trying avoid capture by bounty hunters and Union soldiers after the war ended. This didn't seem particularly inspiring or interesting. However, it did pick up when the incredibly odd character played by Chief Dan George entered the movie. While this character was ridiculous and pretty anachronistic, he was so funny and weird that I really found myself ignoring how ridiculous the character was and was thrilled to see him breathe life into the film.In addition to George, the story itself improved drastically when Eastwood no longer just ran from the law and killed bounty hunters but actually found some settlers to care about and care for. Their plight gave the movie some much needed tension and humanity. The only negative about this section of the film is when Sandra Locke is nearly raped by a band of Comancheros. The rape scene and subsequent nudity should have earned the film an R rating, but oddly despite all this it received a PG. This is really odd, as UNFORGIVEN was rated R, yet is much less explicit than this film. All I know is that this is NOT a film for your kids, though without this brief scene the film would be fine for your teens.Pluses were the characters introduced into the last half of the film (not just George), the excellent conclusion and the fact that the film does dare to be different.

The second is the way it is structured around memories. The entire movie hinges on how Stone imagines his Garrison imagining the recollections of all his 'witnesses' (really just an amalgam of all the conspiracy buffs' theories). At key points, the stock footage and the cinematic 'memories' are sequenced together, producing a Citizen Kane effect. And so I rank this on the 'watchable' end of my rating scale.Stone stated in interviews that his goal was to assemble all of the major conspiracy theories into one movie -- and the result is this elephantine mess, as corpulent as Candy's hipster lawyer. The smart thing to do would have been to focus on one character - Oswald, for example. Oldman handled him especially well - and use the visual storytelling described above to flesh that out...too bad.It didn't take long for this to be relegated to mere entertainment. Only the most hardened conspiracy nut takes this at face value. I won't go through a list of points that I can refute (yawn). But I can advise you to watch Unsolved History JFK - Beyond The Magic Bullet. You may find this useful as an empirical debunking of the 'magic bullet' business that props up this movie and the theories that surround the most studied assassination in history.So what else 'keeps this story from going away'? Mostly, I think it's the war baby and boomer generations' wounded pride -- they can't accept that the Kennedy lion could have been killed by a gnat. I know this is one of Stone's motivating factors.Unfortunately, this is the same guy who slobbers all over that murderous despot Castro. Stone's narrative is the same in every movie -- 'regular' Americans love their country, but it's been hijacked by business greedheads and fascists. It's sad. Sad because so many people take this seriously, in order to fill their emptiness. I had the bilious displeasure of watching Loose Change 2nd Ed., a sign of yet another brewing cultural war.

My 10\/10 rating for LAST ACTION HERO signals that this is mine. But before you laugh me out of IMDb, allow me to explain why I think this notorious bomb is in actuality an unappreciated gem.The central highlight of LAST ACTION HERO is the plot. I've seen this film three times, and in each instance I've been completely drawn into the notion that there exists a magical Movieland where we too could travel if only we had a magic ticket. It's sort of every film buff's fantasy, one that we get to enjoy through young Danny Madigan(Austin O'Brien) as he meets up with clichéd action hero Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger, of course). It's priceless to see the real-world youth interact with the silver screen community and its cartoon cats, 555 phone numbers, and impossibly perfect women. It's equally entertaining when Slater comes into our world, discovering that he can't effortlessly smash his fist through a vehicle window or blow up his enemies with ease. Love it or hate it, you have to admit the story gets high marks for originality.The writing is another highpoint, convincingly mixing so many great elements. Those behind the script nicely exploited the vast potential within the storyline. LAST ACTION HERO is on the one hand a satire of so many action films in which the likes of Schwarzenegger have straightfacedly starred. The oft-sequelized Slater chomps a cigar and wields bullets like confetti at a wedding, effortlessly taking out the bad guys and spewing witty quips. At another angle, the movie is a lighthearted romp, with one-liners and plenty of pokes at Hollywood. From another viewpoint, it's a dramatic piece, with Danny struggling to make it through an awkward age and Slater coming to grips with his unreeled existence -- and that in the real world, the bad guys can and do win. Nowhere along the line is it Oscar-caliber stuff, but it is entertaining.There are other things to like about LAST ACTION HERO. The action is well-paced and well-placed. The acting is more than up to par, with O'Brien and Schwarzenegger great individually and as a tandem. The humor is sharp and effective, with Arnie often hilarious in his self-deprecating ways.Perhaps much of the negative criticism directed LAST ACTION HERO came from those who didn't understand what it was trying to do. This was never meant to be another one of Arnie's shoot-'em-ups, lame attempts at comedy or even a family film. It was just meant to be fun to watch. And that's what matters most in any film. There are things about the film that don't work, but there are things about THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE that don't work, either. All that really matters is, Are we entertained? On that note, LAST ACTION HERO delivers.

Nowhere along the line is it Oscar-caliber stuff, but it is entertaining.There are other things to like about LAST ACTION HERO. The action is well-paced and well-placed. The acting is more than up to par, with O'Brien and Schwarzenegger great individually and as a tandem. The humor is sharp and effective, with Arnie often hilarious in his self-deprecating ways.Perhaps much of the negative criticism directed LAST ACTION HERO came from those who didn't understand what it was trying to do. This was never meant to be another one of Arnie's shoot-'em-ups, lame attempts at comedy or even a family film. It was just meant to be fun to watch. And that's what matters most in any film. There are things about the film that don't work, but there are things about THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE that don't work, either. All that really matters is, Are we entertained? On that note, LAST ACTION HERO delivers.

My 10\/10 rating for LAST ACTION HERO signals that this is mine. But before you laugh me out of IMDb, allow me to explain why I think this notorious bomb is in actuality an unappreciated gem.The central highlight of LAST ACTION HERO is the plot. I've seen this film three times, and in each instance I've been completely drawn into the notion that there exists a magical Movieland where we too could travel if only we had a magic ticket. It's sort of every film buff's fantasy, one that we get to enjoy through young Danny Madigan(Austin O'Brien) as he meets up with clichéd action hero Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger, of course). It's priceless to see the real-world youth interact with the silver screen community and its cartoon cats, 555 phone numbers, and impossibly perfect women. It's equally entertaining when Slater comes into our world, discovering that he can't effortlessly smash his fist through a vehicle window or blow up his enemies with ease. Love it or hate it, you have to admit the story gets high marks for originality.The writing is another highpoint, convincingly mixing so many great elements. Those behind the script nicely exploited the vast potential within the storyline. LAST ACTION HERO is on the one hand a satire of so many action films in which the likes of Schwarzenegger have straightfacedly starred. The oft-sequelized Slater chomps a cigar and wields bullets like confetti at a wedding, effortlessly taking out the bad guys and spewing witty quips. At another angle, the movie is a lighthearted romp, with one-liners and plenty of pokes at Hollywood. From another viewpoint, it's a dramatic piece, with Danny struggling to make it through an awkward age and Slater coming to grips with his unreeled existence -- and that in the real world, the bad guys can and do win.

But it is a great movie for actors. The film lets the actors act and takes a slow pace about. The only good effects in the film do not occur until the last ten minutes and the rest is just story. Kirk Douglas is a great actor and this film does nothing to take his dignity away from him but I believe he would be better served if he just stayed in biblical epics and left the horror to new young actors our at least one's who had a concept of how they should be acted. Douglas tries to make all of his actions seem as if he is in an action film rather then a horror picture which is what this is a big budget version of. It should be added the William Finnley does a great cameo in this and it is the last collaboration between him and De Palma until this years Black Dahlia is released. (I can't wait). This is of course, unless you don't count the fact that Finnley does the voice acting of the killer on the phone in dressed to kill a year later which I don't. In Douglas quest to find his missing son he comes across somewhat De Palma regular Amy Irving and we are left to deal with inability to act for a further hour and a half. I hate her in this film. She was decent in Carrie but stinks in this. They should have given the part to Nacy Allen. The ending effect that I mentioned in post is that of the explosion of the main bad guy at the end. This is the only reason I give this film six stars for it's cool ending. They show this guy blow up from like twenty angles and then the film cuts. Loved it. If you seek this out watch only if you are a De Palma fan. If not a fan just fast forward to the end as it is the only thing worth merit.
