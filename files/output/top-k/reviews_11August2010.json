If you are the brainy type who is interested in quibbling, though, or are simply curious, then read on.Before I start ranting, I just want to say that I enjoy this film enormously, unrealistic dialogue and not very deep characterization notwithstanding. Great fx\/action sequences, good acting, exciting plot, and it's a the best vehicle for introducing philosophy ideas and themes to the uninitiated that Hollywood has ever produced (Malick's 'Thin Red Line' that came out at about this time is also very philosophical, but not at such an overt level). That said, there is a hopeless hodgepodge of schools of thought here that either just don't necessarily mix well or are blatantly conflicting. I was also a bit disappointed with the audio commentary track (on the blu-ray edition) by philosophers Cornel West and Ken Wilbur &#x96; though, again, the uninitiated would benefit enormously from it. West and Wilbur (but especially West) spend way too much time talking about(and revisiting) certain themes and not even mentioning certain other things that I thought were central. As an example of the former, West overly discusses the theme that is the most obvious and really does not need the amount of commentary that it gets that of multicultural\/racial\/gender-equality; since he is primarily known for his writings on race, this is perhaps forgivable since this is what he knows and is interested in, but in some cases he reads his own interpretation into the film that almost certainly was not the Wachowski brothers' intent. To paraphrase a case in point at one point he says that (echoing feminist schools of thought that are popular in Academia these days) since Neo, the One, needs help from Trinity in order to fully realize his potential, and thus he is not completely 'one' without her, this film is really about the breakdown of gender identity. West's point about Neo and Trinity being 'one' is credible, as in Christian theology the father, son and holy spirit are all one and the same being; but in line with the allegorical Christian parallels in the film, its far more likely a unity based in the romantic connection at the end, like a man and a woman becoming one through marriage, rather than any notions of gender breakdown (while it is true that, for survival purposes, the women fight and aren't particularly feminine, the reverse is not true &#x96; the males are never unmasculine, and there are no Lady Macbeth types). As far as skipping over material, in the very beginning there is a direct allusion to the contemporary social theorist Baudrillard (when Neo is making the exchange at his apartment, he is shown to be hiding his discs in a book entitled 'Simulacra and Simulation') . Neither West nor Wilbur even mentions this point, which I think is a significant one, as it is the only direct reference to any philosophical figure, past or present, in the trilogy. Moreover, it is an allusion that comes into conflict with the clear-cut reality vs. illusion dichotomy that (West and Wilbur DO mention) runs throughout the film (the inconsistency is that Baudrillard thinks that modern technology has created a simulation of reality in which we are all living, but there is no deeper reality behind it &#x96; the illusion is all there is). Another problem with the film itself is the lack of resolution between the main theme of the film (good, real humans vs. evil, illusion-producing machines) and Agent Smith's monologue about humans being parasites and machines being the more efficient 'cure' to which good and evil don't apply &#x96; evolution is not only an amoral process, but morality itself is a human social construction of which machines have no concept, and no need. Smith makes a good point that not only isn't satisfactorily answered, but it's the last bit of extended speech in the movie (save Trinity's confession of love and Neo's closing proclamation, neither of which is relevant to Smith's view), and is then dismissed to make way for a final half-hour of continuous, nearly wordless (though thrilling) action sequences.Wilbur mentions one specific inaccuracy the famous 'there is no spoon'line; it was inspired by a Zen Koan (a sort of logically paradoxical parable) in which three monks are observing a flag waving in the wind. The first says the flag is moving; the second says it is not the flag that is moving, but the wind; the third says that neither the flag nor the wind is moving, but only your mind. It's not exactly right to say the spoon does not exist, merely that the spoon is not separable from the mind.This is typical of the film throwing a lot of not-well-understood ideas together in a sloppy fashion. Wilbur himself is all about synthesizing ideas, but here it is done very haphazardly. That's not to say that a clever enough person can't spot holes in any argument, but here it's like glancing up at a clear night sky. In a good story (whether character-driven or action-driven) there's only enough time to suggest ideas if it isn't to lag (as opposed to developing them), but that doesn't mean those ideas should be on-the-surface inconsistent.Having gotten this off my chest, I realize that I am being overly critical. This is a (very good) Hollywood film, a classic of its genre, so to get as much as we did was a blessing.

I'll be Vin! I'll be Chris! I'll be the guy Charles Bronson plays! You weren't quick, and you'd be stuck with Harry Luck.So speaking as the Harry Luck guy, I can't see what the fuss was about.The film introduces us to a Mexican village being robbed of its corn by the cruel bandito Calvera (Eli Wallach). A trio of villagers reach out out to gunslinger Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) for help. He assembles six like-minded killers for hire, and the seven put themselves on the line to protect the village.I promise you we'll all teach him something about the price of corn, Chris vows.Because The Magnificent Seven joins Brynner with such 1960s luminaries as Steve McQueen (Vin), Charles Bronson (Bernardo), James Coburn (Britt), and Robert Vaughn (Lee), I think The Magnificent Seven is given more credit than it deserves. For one thing, director John Sturges ignores all of them in favor of Horst Buchholz as an impetuous Mexican who overplays every scene he's in. For another, the film never realistically offers reasons for why its characters lay their lives on the line.The idea of these gunmen joining forces to protect a village is a good set-up. I never saw The Seven Samurai and can't complain about a rip-off like other user reviews here. Star Wars and A Fistful Of Dollars are great movies that took their plots from the same Japanese director, so the idea isn't wrong on its own. I just wish The Magnificent Seven did more with the material.Spatial reality goes by the boards every time there's a gunfight, people shooting and being killed completely independent of one another. Sturges in combat scenes played to what his audience wanted (stars shooting guns and bad guys falling, until the end when it's the other way around) regardless of what made sense.McQueen sticks out for his laconic dialogue and his willingness to wear a pink shirt. He and Coburn are big film heroes of mine, and both are well presented. You lose, Coburn says at one point, his lean frame all the authority he needs to sell the idea that it really does make sense bringing a knife to a gunfight. Bronson likewise shines in a more challenging role, having to nursemaid three badly-dubbed Mexican boys.Sturges needed more time than he used to develop Vaughn's less steady character, as well as Brad Dexter's role of Harry Luck, a golddigger who never fits into the narrative. Like Glenn Erickson, a.k.a. DVD Savant, said in his otherwise admiring review of the film, it's like he plays a 1940s character in a 1960 film. Most fatally, too much time is spent on Buchholz's Chico character, annoying not because of Buchholz's weakness as an actor but because of the way the character is written. When he confronts Chris and the gang in a bar, you just know he's going to knock over a row of whiskey jiggers before he does, because of the obvious way the scene is set up.SPOILERS - Why Calvera lets the Magnificent Seven ride off with their guns is one of those questions that makes clear this is a film focused on star-making over common sense. Also, as Damarates noted in his March 2007 review, why do Chris and the rest of the Seven put themselves out for a village that obviously betrayed them? When you think of it, Calvera is the only halfway decent character in the movie, giving his opponents the (unmerited) benefit of the doubt - SPOILERS ENDNot a good movie, except for those with memories of how it was when you were kids, this movie was fresh in your hearts, and you weren't stuck playing Harry Luck.

The DVD I saw of this movie had bonus features...one of which goes into why Saltzman fell from being a producer.As for the movie, Moore continues on his way to become the best Bond that he can be. It's not his fault than in his first outing as James Bond he came across as a fop and a dandy...gosh...those dressing robes and powder blue suits of his back then! In his 3rd movie as Bond, he delivers another good performance like he gave in his 2nd outing.Exotic locations - Austria, Egypt etc.Plot -U.S. and Soviet submarines go missing. 007 is revealed to be the pre-eminent 00 agent and he is tasked with finding out what happened to the submarines. In the U.S.S.R. the top Soviet secret agent Triple X (!) is also tasked with finding out what happened to the missing Soviet submarine...and they have to do it together...but can they trust each other? Does one of them have another agenda?Bond movie clichés Pre-title sequence - This movie is the first GREAT opening sequence in the Bond franchise. From this point on - especially with Moore's films - they become an event in themselves. In this movie the scene features some great action on the snow. You can hear a funkified Bond theme here too...Bond '77?The Bond theme - The first classic song of the Moore era...by Carly Simon. Still stacks up well today as a song in it's own right. Carole Bayer Sager wrote the lyrics.Q - Q is revealed to be called Major Boothroyd in this movie. Q Section's contribution in this movie will no doubt excite many...boys especially...it's a white Lotus car that...M - M's name is Miles, I think...he's referred to as that by General Gogol.Points of interest * General Gogol...I think that this is his first appearance in a Bond movie. He'll appear in at least two others, from memory. He is the Soviet Union's equivalent to M. Hmm...he sounds a bit like Sean Connery times at times...maybe that's just me! M calls him Alexis in this movie.* Is there no language that Bond can't speak? He speaks some Arabic in this movie. Connery's Bond spoke Japanese in You only live twice. Hmm.* After Connery's last film in the role (to that point) pretty much pretended that On her majesty's secret service never happened, it's nice to have this chapter in Bond's life finally recognised in this movie. Triple X brings up the topic.* It's a nice twist on expectation to find out that Triple X is actually...* Note to self...Bond says to Triple X na zdorovye...this isn't translated in the subtitles though.* Arguably the greatest henchman of all time is introduced in this series. The bonus features mention some interesting facts about the make up trials for the person playing them.* There is a particularly good dynamic between 007 and Triple X, after 007 meets Agent Borzov in the pre-title sequence.* I like the music in the underwater sequence to this movie...it's a pity that such incidental music hasn't found its way onto Bond soundtrack compilations.* In polls I've run on the franchise, Major Anya Amasova is quite popular as a Bond love interest...one of the most popular, behind Tracy and Vesper.The 2nd in a string of entertaining outings by Roger Moore in the role...he's had more good Bond movies than anyone else, in my opinion...yes, even Sean Connery!

I'm a huge Nine fan, so I'm over-familiar with the plot. I understand that the Broadway version was based on 8 1\/2, but it's not fair to judge Nine as a 8 1\/2 remake. It's like judging a Halloween remake to John Carpenter's classic. Since it was an adaptation on the Broadway show, judge it to that. Enough about Nine, now.Fellini's work here has left me speechless. There is no words to describe this picture. Since it's a cinematic autobiography, obviously, he was going to hit it hard, but no way did I ever expect what I just saw. He uses present reality, past reality, and fantasy. It's hard to tell when he is switching from reality to fantasy. And at times, fantasy intertwines with reality making that confusing as well. But the more you see it, the more you take away from it. Fellini has so much control of the picture, it's uncanny what he did here. It's a shame he doesn't have the Directing Oscar for '64.The story is madness. Pure madness. Like I said before everything it balances, fantasy, reality, his past. It's brilliant, it accurately shows what artists go though. It explores many themes and makes you sit up and think. The acting here is also very good. Marcello Mastroianni gives one of the best performance in the history of the cinema. Aimee is wonderful as the suffering wife.

James Stewart (as Scotty) starts out playing one of his average-guy hero characters, who falls into depression and then into a troubling obsession because of his misplaced romantic love. Most films seem to glorify romance & love. Hitchcock seems to have wanted to point out that though this emotion can be at the center of our lives it is often based upon superficialities. Many films present love as something that is destine to happen between two people. I think that Hitchcock was having fun with this idea, flipping it on its head and twisting it with all sorts of irony... e.g. The person who Scotty fell so deeply in love with did not really exist, she was simply an 'act' (i.e. It's Judy pretending to be Madeleine, who were two very different types of women).Scotty fell completely for the con-job that was Judy pretending to be Madeleine. Then to complicate things Judy in turn also falls in love with him. As part of a murder scheme, Scotty is lead to believe 'his' Madeleine has died, in part, due to his negligence. Later when he is wandering the streets of San Francisco he stumbles upon Judy whom he thinks only looks like his lost love. He then strikes up a romantic relationship with her... But Scotty does not appear to be capable of loving Judy for who she really is. e.g. He had become morbidly obsessed with Judy's fake version of Madeleine and he pressures Judy into looking & acting like her (once again), which she does out of love for him. Because of Judy's love for Scotty she decides that her tastes, preferences and even her personality didn't really matter anymore... e.g. Judy gives-in to Scotty's desires and takes on the personality of someone very different from herself.In one sense Scotty is the archetypal romantic hero, who against all odds finds his lost love. But in another sense he is a 'sucker' and someone who has been rendered mentally unstable by his love for a woman who never really existed. Contrast this with Scotty's best friend (Midge), a fairly attractive woman who adores him. Compared to Judy, Midge seems like a woman much more suited to Scotty's tastes. But he is just too romantically fixated on Judy's 'faux' Madeleine for Midge to have a real shot at him. This movie is great for a lot of reasons, many of which have already been mentioned here in other reviews, including 1.) Novak skillfully playing two very different personalities. 2.) The view it gives us of San Francisco circa the 1950's. 3.) The movie's plot goes through very interesting thematic changes (Starting as a supernatural love story\/drama then changing mid-stream into a psychological drama heavily laden with irony.). 4.) It has a wonderful musical score. 5.) And there is a VERY dark ending to the story (Something almost unheard of in American movies prior to the mid-1960's) There are some slight glitches to this film's storyline, None of which I feel are too distracting with the possible exception of the somewhat convoluted wife-murder-scheme, which might seem too far-fetched for some people to accept. But then again, this murder scheme seems just as believable as those portrayed in many of Agatha Christie's famous stories. If I remember correctly Hitchcock said that he felt that such background details were not that important when trying to get an audience immersed into a story. Hey the story works for me!

It is about Henry's battle in Harfleur and Agincourt as well as the immediate aftermath, namely Henry marrying Katherine of France. Shakespeare took some creative licensee when writing his play, and Kenneth Branagh stuck to Shakespeare's original work the best he could, and didn't leave anything out of the original script.The characters in Kenneth Branagh's version of Henry V are very believable, especially Kenneth Branagh's portrayal as King Henry V. The performances of the actors as the big name English characters were so good they made me feel something for them. When Henry found the boy dead, I felt sorry for him and his loss. When Henry rejects Falstaff, I felt something for Falstaff because of how well the actor portrayed him.The list goes on and on in terms of what emotions were going on when different things happened to different characters. I also didn't feel sorry for any of the French people for getting killed because they odds were stacked heavily in their favour and they weren't shown in much of a positive light.The actors fit their roles very well. The best actor of the bunch is Kenneth Branagh, and there is a slew of other good actors to go along with him. Kenneth Branagh made the character of Henry V come to life and be more than just words on pages. His supporting cast helps bring the play to life even more so because of how well the actors portrayed their characters. The character of Pistol was done to near perfection and the actors playing the Frenchmen brought life to their characters.The film isn't just a tour de force but a solid film about a historical event. It does have a sense of art about it, but that's because all films are art. It expresses a vision about a historic battle, albeit from only the English side, and stayed true to the source.Kenneth Branagh brought some of his directorial flavour to the film. He orchestrated an engaging battle scene about the Battle of Agincourt, and he used the film medium well. The best scene of the film is when Henry V (Kenneth Branagh) is carrying Boy (Christian Bale) through the battle field after the fighting stopped. The music accompanying the scene and the long take make it wonderful to behold.The themes of the film are both obvious and subtle. Without prior knowledge, someone watching might not realize why the church people are encouraging Henry V to go to war, but with prior knowledge that they wanted to keep their lands safe, it makes sense. After it's been established that Henry V wants to invade France, it's easy to follow and know what's going on. The Chorus helps the audience understand the plot by explaining what is going on with the characters.The setting is both England and France and both are depicted rather well. The cinematography for both locals is great and adds to the flavour of the film. The way each country is shown is amazing and really well done. The wonderful cinematography adds to the realism and makes me want to visit the locales depicted in the film.Kenneth Branagh's filming style was to use still cameras for most shots and occasional panning shots. This is very effective because it lets the viewer know what's going on and the action is depicted very well. The angles used to show different soldiers being killed was masterfully done and deserves an amount of praise. We never actually see anyone get impaled with an arrow, but Branagh effectively showed us people impaled by such in such a way that it didn't matter we didn't see the arrow actually find its place in someone's flesh.The soundtrack for this film fits it very well, especially the song sung over Henry V walking across the battlefield at Agincourt carrying the boy. The rest of the soundtrack fits the mood of the scenes they accompany very well. It's not light music, which is a good thing because of the style of writing it follows, and it's not too depressing, either.The camera angles are good, but nothing too special. Kenneth Branagh made sure to show what he needed to in each scene, but the camera angles were mostly flat. The focus of the shots was good, though, and he used close ups extremely well. I'm a bit of a sucker for close ups, especially the really close ones, so that plays into it somewhat, but they have to be good close ups for me to love them.There isn't really gratuitous violence and there's no sexual content. The battle scene could have been bloodier, but the way it was shot is still sublime. The violence and gore wasn't over the top and extreme but fit the story very well because there was an important battle fought between the English and French, and it was the focal point of the play and film.All in all, this film is very well crafted from pretty much every stand point. The ending is a bit long, but that's my only gripe towards it. It's a very good film with superb acting and direction by Kenneth Branagh. I would like to see more of his Shakespeare films because of how well he handled this one.

We never actually see anyone get impaled with an arrow, but Branagh effectively showed us people impaled by such in such a way that it didn't matter we didn't see the arrow actually find its place in someone's flesh.The soundtrack for this film fits it very well, especially the song sung over Henry V walking across the battlefield at Agincourt carrying the boy. The rest of the soundtrack fits the mood of the scenes they accompany very well. It's not light music, which is a good thing because of the style of writing it follows, and it's not too depressing, either.The camera angles are good, but nothing too special. Kenneth Branagh made sure to show what he needed to in each scene, but the camera angles were mostly flat. The focus of the shots was good, though, and he used close ups extremely well. I'm a bit of a sucker for close ups, especially the really close ones, so that plays into it somewhat, but they have to be good close ups for me to love them.There isn't really gratuitous violence and there's no sexual content. The battle scene could have been bloodier, but the way it was shot is still sublime. The violence and gore wasn't over the top and extreme but fit the story very well because there was an important battle fought between the English and French, and it was the focal point of the play and film.All in all, this film is very well crafted from pretty much every stand point. The ending is a bit long, but that's my only gripe towards it. It's a very good film with superb acting and direction by Kenneth Branagh. I would like to see more of his Shakespeare films because of how well he handled this one.

'Texas Chainsaw; was darker, scarier, and grittier than anything seen before it. It is a classic that is still effective and capable of scaring people after nearly forty years. Why? Tobe Hooper realized the true nature of fear. Horror films often are merely freak shows full of grotesques. 'Texas Chainsaw' takes a group of people and drags them ever closer to a place they would never want to go to. Hooper doesn't think his audience is stupid. Suspense is key.'Texas Chainsaw' feels real. It has sensationalist tendencies but there are pieces when we almost ignore them. The film looks like somebody brought out a home video camera and shot away. The feel of the film is blunt, to the point, and in many ways brilliant. Much is made of the documentary style filmmaking and it really is the highlight of the film. In someways it isn't what Hooper adds to his film but rather the horror clichés he omits. There isn't an overbearing soundtrack telling us how to feel. Our first introduction to the psychopath Leatherface is so abrupt we barely have time to collect our senses. It doesn't go for cheap jumpy scares. It heightens the tension but also strengthens our bound with the characters. I for one felt I was brought with into the Sawyer household and snuck into the rooms with our characters. It isn't because these characters are really all that well written, besides for Sally and Franklin, none of them have any sort of personality. The reason we care for them is because the distance is lessened. Real empathy is generated when we view these characters as human beings and not stereotypes. There isn't a glaring horror soundtrack or a character archetype spouting clichés. We forget we are in a horror film. The grimness of the situation speaks for it's self. The bones, the hideous man child, and the cannibalism need no more accenting lest they become over the top.People seem to forget that Chainsaw is a well acted picture too. Jim Siedow, Gunner Hansen, and Ed O'Neil all create fully fleshed out villains. We've seen various characters like Leatherface in countless horror films but Hansen adds depth to it. He isn't merely a mute with a chainsaw. Acting mute doesn't mean throwing a performance away. Hansen' performance is fully dimensional despite us never seeing his face. There is a brilliant scene in the film which really highlights both Hansen and Hooper's work. It is the first scene where we get to get a really close look at Leatherface, his face is accented by the dim sunlight coming through the slits of the shudders. Horror doesn't advertise that it's horror, we take a good look at Leatherface the only sound being his childlike groans. Leatherface looks somewhat pathetic in this scene, sad and unaware of the evil he is doing. That is really the strength of all the actors of the Sawyer family. In a twisted way they don't believe what they are doing is wrong. In someways the absurdness of the scenes where Siedow gathers his family for a meal both give us a break from the terror while intensifying it at the same time. We find ourselves with a little smirk but we soon realize the horror behind it. The Swayer family gives brilliant performances which bring out the best of the script.All in all 'Texas Chainsaw' is a well shot and well acted film which won't be forgotten any time soon. It's a blueprint every horror film actor should look at.

After obsessing about his dead mother for so long, he psychologically turned into her persona at times. The women Norman Bates kills, were killed when his mother's persona was in charge.The main characters are Norman Bates, and Marion Crane, portrayed by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, respectively.The overall theme of this movie seems to deal with the uncertainty of unfamiliar people. When Marion, the main character, happens to meet the socially-awkward Norman Bates, she probably couldn't have imagined getting murdered by him. The message seems to be that you can never really know if the next person you meet is truly crazy.A movie with a similar theme is Hitchhiker, in which a person driving across the country picks up a hitchhiker, who ultimately does many sadistic things to the driver. In that movie, it was also clear that you just don't know which strangers to trust.Perhaps the most famous scene in Psycho is the one in which Marion is stabbed to death in the shower, frequently referred to as the shower scene, in pop culture. This scene is shot and pieced together with many short clips, all shot at different angles. The constant views at different angles make the scene more suspenseful and frightening, in my opinion. Although the attacker in the scene remains obscure, it appears to be that of a woman. Ultimately, it is revealed that Norman also dresses as Mother, whenever he thinks he is Mother.Another scene that best exemplifies how crazy Norman is, is the final scene, in which he's locked up in a prison cell. Mother is thinking that everyone has it wrong &#x96; he wouldn't even hurt a fly! The camera closes in upon him as Mother's thoughts are narrated. And in the close-up of Norman, an eerie feeling is truly conveyed.When this film was first released, I think it was a first of its kind in some aspects. I think that never before, a murder had been so graphic in a movie.

Turns out it's not a horror movie, in fact I'm not even sure what genre of film it is, but one thing for sure is that it's twisted and suspenseful. Shadow of the Vampire is based on the premise that Max Schrek, who played Count Orlock in real-life movie Nosferatu, actually WAS a vampire. Shadow of the Vampie is sort of a fictional documentary related to horror I guess.Max is one of the most genuine characters you'll ever come across. He's strange and mysterious and almost comedic. His character is very believable - when you see him on the screen you'll feel his pain and loneliness and be intrigued by him, despite the fact that he's a bloodsucking vampire and doesn't look like he smells too pleasant.The rest of the characters are also genuine, in particular the director.. you truly believe how obsessed and out of touch with reality this man gets with making the movie. The acting in this movie was phenomenal. There wasn't a single part where the cynic in me went yeah right, which admittedly happens in a lot of movies. The plot is suspenseful and goes along smoothly, nothing too ridiculous even though the whole premise itself is pretty unlikely. The plot is fairly easy to grasp but intriguing. A lot of the lines are simple but will have you thinking (especially Max's - he is a rather insightful creature).The quality of the movie itself is also phenomenal. This was definitely not a low budget movie, nor was it too over the top with effects and whatnot. I like some of the effects like when the filming INSIDE the movie starts, the camera turns into a black-and-white, no sound picture like the original movie. The rest of the scenery is generally dark and romantic and makes a perfect background for the story (rather than being a modern-day version). The nd is predicable but it's suspenseful all the same.

Since I actually wrote a 20th Anniversary review that was published elsewhere in 2006, I decided to polish that one a little. Also, I noticed something that tells *a lot* about the timelessness of this classic. In 2006, I noted down that ALIENS was at #71 in the IMDb Top 250. What a delight it is to see it (almost) four years later at #54. Now how many movies do go up in the Top 250? Not many. Curiously, it just happens that of those that do, many are also some of my personal favorites for example, in *just* the last 15 months, Terminator 2 has risen from #61 to #42. And in the last three years, Terminator has managed an astonishing rise from #201 to #158. That's *43* notches! Both are James Cameron movies. Does Avatar have something to do with this? Probably, but I just suspect it made a new generation discover these timeless classics. These movies just don't age.But I digress. Not only is ALIENS a universally recognized classic and arguably the best sequel of all time (with the possible exceptions of The Godfather Part II, Star Wars Episode V &#x96; The Empire Strikes back and The Dark Knight), its influence has been more widely spread than most may realize. Yes, this is probably mentioned in every other review, but it is such an important entry in the annals of Hollywood that *not* mentioning it would risk spreading ignorance. And ignorance of the chain of events in cinema history leads to the youth holding such drivel as The Twilight Saga (more like a toxic stream) above gems such as ALIENS.In Alien, Ripley became the sole survivor, but it was not until ALIENS that she'd become *a warrior*. The commercial success of ALIENS meant not only countless copy-cat movies, but also that the decision-makers realized that females could be heroes as well. This paved way to Xena (1995), Buffy (1997), Alias (2001) and many others.It is also notable how well ALIENS has aged it is still as effective as when it premiered, mostly thanks to James Camerons perfectionism and innovativeness if the technology for something he wanted did not exist, he'd invent it. Avatar proved he's also still *the best* director of heart-pounding action in the world the way Aliens nails you to your seat when it gets going is matched only by Cameron's work in the Terminator movies.

I admittedly don't watch many films from the 40s, because of bad experiences with great films such as this). Citizen Kane is a monumental achievement because of some of the technical aspects. I have no reason to watch Citizen Kane ever again though. I don't particularly like any of the acting, and the story is just dull to me. I don't watch movies for editing, camera work, lighting or technical achievements. Those aspects of filmmaking certainly can greatly help or hurt a film, but without a good script, and without good acting, you just have a good-looking movie. That's the case with Citizen Kane. Supremely directed and extremely well crafted for its time, but I just didn't care for the man or the exposition of most scenes. A lot of directors can make a good-looking film, and a lot have. The remake of All the King's Men is wonderfully shot, but the movie is a complete mess that is just butchered by the director (most noticeably the atrocious casting and the shampoo commercial-esque editing). All the King's Men does have a good performance from Penn, but that's about it. Other than that? It is a terrible movie. Citizen Kane is not that bad and Welles' direction is far better, but I think it's a similar case were two movies look a lot better than anything that's happening between the characters, or within the story. The characters might be exquisitely framed, but I just didn't care what they had to say. It is masterfully made for its time and it is a greatly influential film. That's what it is remembered for and what it was always be remembered for. Rosebud comes second. If you rate a movie purely on direction, then you probably give it a high score.

It isn't easy to find a good rom-com in this day and age but stumbling upon When Harry Met Sally was quite the treat. It's the story of two friends, Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and Sally Albright (Meg Ryan). They are best friends, trying their hardest to keep sex out of the relationship so as not to complicate things. It's a charming story with fun characters and witty dialouge. The film is funny in its own subtle way without the use of stupid humor or sight gags. I had a great time watching this film and it kept me amused and interested the whole way through.I'm a huge Rob Reiner (The Princess Bride, Stand by Me) fan. His style of subtle and intelligent humor is something that you just don't see anymore. When Harry Met Sally is a great example of his comedic style and it never loses its touch throughout the entire film. And while the wit and intelligence of the film remains the same all the way through, it changes its tone and pacing multiple times, making for an intriguing and diversified watch. The creative way in which the story progresses breaks away from the way thousands of other romantic comedies play out, and that makes for something so fresh and original that you can't help but love it.Major kudos also go out to the limited cast of this film. When Harry Met Sally really only comprises of two main characters (Crystal and Ryan) and two supporting characters (Kirby and Fisher). Bruno Kirby (Donnie Brasco, The Basketball Diaries) plays Harry's best guy friend and Carrie Fisher (Star Wars) plays Sally's best girl friend. The interactions between these four characters make some of the most memorable scenes in the film. With such a small group of central characters, each must serve a legitimate and relevant purpose, and they all four go above and beyond in this respect.When Harry Met Sally is a fantastic film that defines what all romantic comedies should be. Its intelligence and wit is something you don't see much anymore, making it a film that stands out among the thousands of others like it. It's a wonderfully directed, intelligently written, and superbly acted film. Definitely check this one out.

So you try closing your eyes to capture and further cherish the images, the music and the overall experience.I watched the film again to find many many jewels that I've missed.

All subtle and well employed by the director. The acting is nothing less than superbly amazing by namely Wes Bently (Rick), also by Chris Cooper (Colonel Frank), Thora Birch (Jane), Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. Added th that, Allan Ball's clever script & Sam Mendez's artistic direction, earn this film in my opinion a 9\/10.Lester Burnham, a typical suburbia male in his forties (played by Kevin Spacey) dreams on from the start on.. He gives you many reasons to disgust him.. but not for long .. soon you'll find your self understanding and liking him a lot.His wife (played by Annette Bening) invokes a laugh or two about how silly our suburban life can be, and she manages to maintain your dislike for the irritating persona much longer towards the end. Only then you discover you like her too.Their teenage daughter Jane (a lovable freak) is so enjoyably genuine and vivid that you'd wish she is your daughter.There comes the freaky neighbors Frank, a US Army colonel, who constantly freaking out his son and neighbors. His wife, or what he left of her, is long worn out by him, but still finds love in her heart to inject in their son.The film gives you every thinkable reason of hating the colonel, but amazingly giving him so much credibility and depth that you, even knowing what he's capable of, start sympathizing with this wreck of a human being towards the end of the movie.The real admirable role in the film is their son Rick (played by Wes Bently). Although he's so f...d up, he sees a lot of life and love in everything. He earns the love of the girl at school, her father, and, believe me, yours too.Don't miss this dream of a film. As Lester says of his dream in the beginning of the film SPECTACULAR!!!!

Added th that, Allan Ball's clever script & Sam Mendez's artistic direction, earn this film in my opinion a 9\/10.Lester Burnham, a typical suburbia male in his forties (played by Kevin Spacey) dreams on from the start on.. He gives you many reasons to disgust him.. but not for long .. soon you'll find your self understanding and liking him a lot.His wife (played by Annette Bening) invokes a laugh or two about how silly our suburban life can be, and she manages to maintain your dislike for the irritating persona much longer towards the end. Only then you discover you like her too.Their teenage daughter Jane (a lovable freak) is so enjoyably genuine and vivid that you'd wish she is your daughter.There comes the freaky neighbors Frank, a US Army colonel, who constantly freaking out his son and neighbors. His wife, or what he left of her, is long worn out by him, but still finds love in her heart to inject in their son.The film gives you every thinkable reason of hating the colonel, but amazingly giving him so much credibility and depth that you, even knowing what he's capable of, start sympathizing with this wreck of a human being towards the end of the movie.The real admirable role in the film is their son Rick (played by Wes Bently). Although he's so f...d up, he sees a lot of life and love in everything. He earns the love of the girl at school, her father, and, believe me, yours too.Don't miss this dream of a film. As Lester says of his dream in the beginning of the film SPECTACULAR!!!! ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"11 August 2010","score":"","review":" A simple What goes on.. beyond the facade.. in American suburbia. This though is so cleverly written and superbly employed as just an element in a fantastic dream.When the film is over, you'll find your self, as if you been suddenly awaken from a dream, that you want so much to continue. So you try closing your eyes to capture and further cherish the images, the music and the overall experience.I watched the film again to find many many jewels that I've missed. Then I soon found my self watching the film a third time to fathom, absorb, and enjoy the dream as a whole.Enjoy the many genius strokes of cinematography by Conrad Hall, chillingly cozy musical impressions by Thomas Newman.. All subtle and well employed by the director.

All we knew at the beginning of the first was that is was set a few years in the future, in the Australian desert. This time we are told that it is a post apocalyptic future, overrun by biker gangs, and a drop of fuel is worth more than gold.The ending of Mad Max was disappointing but there was the promise of something epic to come. this is it. Now that we have gotten to know Mad Max, it's time for him to become a hero, and while he only has half as much to say in this one, he has five times as much to do. Max helps an isolated oil community fight back against an invading biker gang led by a goon in a Gladiator's helmet. He must help them to get to a paradise two thousand miles away, driving their precious oil tanker, while a battery of fire power and arrows comes after them.With so many wheels on the desert road, it's no wonder than Mad Max 2 kicks up more dust than any action film around, The climax is reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Duel, only far more epic. For a b-movie, it gets quite intense, and even though the ending comes a bit quickly, there is a sense of closure to this one, but we are still left excited for more.

Yes, Officer Rawlins died some time after being shot by Morgan\/Martin (Richard Basehart), and there was that hit on Detective Chuck Jones (James Cardwell), but he lived, and it didn't seem to me that murder was the focus of the story. It had more to do it seems, with the cunning displayed by Basehart's character in pulling off small time burglaries, then graduating to armed robbery, all the while leaving no clues and eluding authority's attempt to track him down.Nor does the film completely fill the noir definition with it's lack of a slick and dangerous femme-fatale. What it does have though for fans of these Forties era flicks, is Jack Webb in a nice warm-up for his radio and TV 'Dragnet' series, filling the role of a forensics cop who provides the first lead to Roy Martin's real identity. The neatest twist of the whole story, for me at least, was watching Martin maneuver his way around the underground LA sewer system, and pull a rifle out of a carefully selected hiding spot! Now there was a guy who did his homework.He Walked by Night is one of those ubiquitous public domain titles you'll find packaged by itself or in compilations of a hundred pictures or more. It's a bit slow in spots but generally manages to hold interest and entertain in a satisfactory way. Scott Brady fans will get a kick seeing him here at the tender age of twenty four but looking considerably older. A year later, he would travel cross country as a customs agent to go up against Yul Brynner in 1949's Port of New York.
