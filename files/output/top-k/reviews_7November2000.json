It is usually on target and works well, but it isn't as perfect as the majority thinks.The story follows a weird kid (played by Jason Schwartzman of the Coppola family and son of Talia Shire in a fine debut) who is content in being a academically bad student, but then finds the apple of his eye, a teacher (Olivia Williams) who changes his perspective.  But, he is contending against a millionaire (Bill Murray in one of his finest roles) who wants her just as much.  Some very wise moments and looks on school life and love, however, the lulls lower the standards just a tad.  Still, worth seeing for the performances alone, especially Murray.
