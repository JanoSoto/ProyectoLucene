The Limey, I thought. I also thought never heard of it. Well, it's got Terence Stamp in it, and he's usually good, and it's directed by Steven Soderbergh, and that's great because I thoroughly enjoyed Out Of Sight. On the other hand, it looked distinctly like the opening credits were setting up a distinctly art-house film which I really wasn't in the mood for. I mean, let's face it - this is part of an all-night movie marathon, it's three o'clock in the morning, and it follows Starship Troopers, Go and South Park Bigger, Longer and Uncut. Nope, not the right time for such a film.Usually I'm all for this type of film, but I just ended up comparing it to too many other things. Michael Winterbottom's superb I Want You, for example - there are many similarities in the cinematography, visual style and narrative structure of both films. Secondly, it is obvious to compare it to Out Of Sight - dangerous, because they are two very different films - but nevertheless the similarities are there. The Limey tries to fill an art-house cinema role, and just seems to end up floundering around the nearly, but naff area of moviemaking. Perhaps Soderbergh let the excellence of Out Of Sight go to his head - after all, it was an exceedingly hard act to follow. The thing is, if you compare it to pretty much anything similar, it'll come off looking second best.Reading the other reviews on this website, I am curious to know why so many people were attracted to it. It is perhaps because the majority of comments are from the US, and France - with only one comment from England, and one from Ireland.  So, perhaps the audience reaction is one of enthusiasm for the tough-hardened-criminal with a quick with and a chip on his shoulder that we Brits have in abundance (of _course_ we do - surely you've seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Trainspotting, Shallow Grave blah blah blah...).  Of course such people exist, but that many of them?  Nah.  Terence Stamp was almost convincing as Wilson (leaving aside the obligatory cockney rhyming slang at every irritating interval), but every other character in the movie was criminally neglected - even Peter Fonda's character, the other principle part, was hazy at best. These are characters we do not feel for, I felt no connection with, and by the end of the movie, I really didn't care what happened. As it so happens, I have forgotten what the ending of the movie is. It only finished a couple of hours ago.All this is highly disappointing stuff. We know Soderbergh can do better, and we know Stamp can do better.

Sydney Prescott is a teenager who goes to school with her many friends.  She seems normal but she is not.  Her mother have been murdered and raped one year ago and a killer tries to kill her.  The phones rings and people screams and everybody's a suspect.This movie allows us to discover a new genius Kevin Williamson.  His script is totally wise and original.  The character are not cliché and stupid, they seems to me realistic and they are great, all of them.  The story itself is extremely good and original.  The ending petrified me with the revelation of the killer.  I thought that all the scenes are extremely good and breath taking.  And a thing that is wonderful is all the movies references in the movie.  I am a horror movies fan since my childhood and I grow up with Nightmare on elm street, Friday the !3 and Halloween and it was a pleasure for me to see that the characters in the film also saw those films.  It was a big fun also to find all the references.  This movie does not take us for dumb teenagers.The interpretations are very good.  Neve Campbell is wonderful and great. Her character is not a dumb girl.  I think that she is one of the best actresses of her generation.  David Arquette is very funny and he is perfect in his role.  When I saw that Courteney Cox was in the film, I was worried because of her last films but she impressed me a lot.  She is one of my favorite actresses.  For the others, they are great too, especially Billy and Stu.  For those who saw the film know why.Wes Craven made most of the film that I watched when I was a little kid. This one is his best I think.  The actors are pretty well directed and everything is good.  I can't wait to see Scream 3.There are a lot of people who blame the film for violence in our society because of his realistic violence.  I think that it doesn't influence badly the teenagers or adults or whatever.  The violent scenes are not funny or light.  The first scene is totally terrible and it does not make me wanted to kill blind girls.  The rest of the film is like that.  Murders are terrible and I think it's a movie that takes it seriously.

They dissed the dreamy, chilling VERTIGO, and spurned THE SEARCHERS for failing to present the usual Simon-pure hero.  In one case, though, I think the '50's generation was right and today's movie fans are wrong.  TOUCH OF EVIL should have remained in the oblivion to which its contemporaries consigned it.The storyline follows Mexican policeman Mike Vargas (played by Charlton Heston!!??) and his wife Susan (the ravishing Janet Leigh) as he investigates a car bombing and she gets threatened a lot by some gangsters against whom her husband is going to testify.  The story ends up dividing into two very tenuously connected plots, as Susan is isolated at a motel with an idiotic night man (shades of PSYCHO) while Mike at first tries to help, and then tries to thwart bigoted detective Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles).Welles wrote, directed and starred in this movie.  Yes, I said starred; Vargas may be the clean-cut hero, but everybody's eyes are on Quinlan.  Welles makes a great heavy, in the literal as well as figurative sense, and he is scary as hell.  In the starring department, he's great; in the directing department he's madly inconsistent; and in the writing department, he stinks.Now I am sure to be burned at the stake for heresy in questioning Welles' direction in this movie.  Certainly, his use of the camera is extremely imaginative, as in the stupendously long opening shot; he cuts back and forth with superb timing in the suspenseful conclusion; he has some neat continuous shots in an apartment and an elevator; and he does a truly ghastly murder scene by flashing lights.  But there's more to directing than just camera work.  You have to handle your cast, and Welles doesn't.  Allowing Heston to be cast as the lead was insane; even though Welles owed the directing job to Heston, he could have given him the role of Peter Menzies.  And where was Welles when Akim Tamiroff and Dennis Weaver were over-acting like the sky was about to fall?  Even if their absurd approaches to their roles were their own idea and not Welles' responsibility, Welles should at least have demanded re-takes of all their scenes, and told them to calm down or else he'd find some better actors.However, what really sinks the movie is the sheer absurdity of the script, which Welles himself adapted from a cheap novel.  A tiny explosive barely the size of a hand grenade, dropped in a trunk, blasts a car off the ground like the eruption of Mount Saint Helens.  A woman is then called in to identify the charred, burned and dismembered corpses.  Displeased with Vargas' investigation, a punk throws dark, sticky Movie Acid at him that sticks to a wall and burns through it like a hot knife through warm butter.  Then Janet Leigh is driven by a friendly policeman to the Amazing Coincidence Motel, which just happens to be owned by the gangsters who've been threatening her.  They don't need to threaten her any more, since they have an incriminating photo to blackmail her with, but they do it anyway, and the photo is never mentioned again.  A dopehead whispers through her wall about the joys of mainlining (injecting) marijuana.  Then, as she shivers and cowers, unarmed goons slowly stalk into her apartment and she lets them assault her, even though she has a loaded gun in easy reach (this despite earlier scenes that established her as a fiery, combative woman). In sum, TOUCH OF EVIL pays no more attention to detail and character consistency than any direct-to-video thriller of the present day.  This is bad in any movie, but worst in a mystery thriller, where even the most casual audience members are keeping an eye out for the little details that will catch the killers and unmask the frauds later on.If you thought that SNAKE EYES was genius, you should love TOUCH OF EVIL.  But if you refuse to let slam-bang camera antics distract you from the absence of characterization, poor plotting (both depend heavily on deus ex machina devices), and uneven acting, you'd best avoid both of them.

He'd cleaned up the city and made it safe.  He'd sent the badmen packing or to prison.  He'd just hung up his star and married beautiful young Amy Fowler, surrounded by his loving and loyal friends, and he looked forward to a peaceful life with her as a storekeeper.  And Then It Happened.A telegram reaches him to let him know that Frank Miller, an outlaw killer whom Kane thought was to be hanged, has been pardoned and will arrive at the Hadleyville train station at high noon.  Three of his old time bandit companions are waiting for Miller there, and they will surely come to kill Kane when Miller arrives.At first, Kane prepares to run.  But he realizes that the killers will come after him and Amy; they have to be faced, and it might as well be here and now with a posse at his back.  So Kane pins his badge back on and goes to his friends and neighbors for help in facing the badmen, but most of them turn their backs on Kane.This movie gives a brilliant examination of the cowardice of Kane's fellow townspeople.  The person who remains most mysterious is Kane himself.  Courage, as I understand it, is the ability to ignore one's fear in order to do what must be done.  Kane is afraid, and he is able to ignore his fear, but why does he think that he must fight?  Does he feel a duty to protect Hadleyville, even though it has spurned him?  Is he convinced that, no matter where he runs, he will still have to fight the four killers alone?  Does he believe that running from any situation, no matter how impossible, is unmanly and dishonorable?  Would he have fought ten men?  A hundred?  A million?  Kane himself doesn't seem to be entirely sure.  He clearly has very strong morals, but lacks the ability to explain them.  Even when a man asks him to cheat the new sheriff out of a job, Kane refuses, but can't explain why, merely saying, If you don't know, there's no use in me telling you.  When someone asks him why he says I've got to fight the killers now, he frankly admits that he doesn't know.Lloyd Bridges is excellent as Harvey Pell, Kane's former deputy and the first man Kane approaches for help.  When Pell cravenly abandons Kane to his fate, Bridges is wonderful at showing his guilt.  One of the best parts of the movie is where Pell tries to allay his guilt by trying to get Kane to run away; if Kane won't fight, Pell thinks his own cowardice will feel more excusable.Grace Kelly, in her first major role, is quite good as a woman whose Quaker religion compels her to pacifism, and cannot understand her husband's need to meet violence with violence.  Even better is Katy Jurado as the beautiful, tempestuous Helen Ramirez, who understands Kane far better than Amy does.  Harry Morgan portrays Sam Fuller, a deputy so gutless that he not only won't face Frank Miller, but won't even face Kane to tell him so.  And Thomas Mitchell is great as the town leader who subordinates Kane's life to the economic future of the town.As an allegory for the Hollywood blacklist, HIGH NOON is pretty weak.  Kane is not falsely accused of subverting the town's welfare; the whole emotional power of the plot is based on the fact that the townsmen refuse to help him even though everybody recognizes that he has done nothing but good for Hadleyville.  The killers, on the other hand, are openly lawless and evil, not poseurs pretending to protect the townsmen by their persecution of others.  Still, whatever its flaws as an allegory, HIGH NOON is one heck of a great western and a great story.Fred Zinneman did a very good job on directing the movie, with one exception.  Throwing out the usual Western orchestra for Dimitri Tiomkin's lonely guitar music was a good idea, but it is used far too much.  It doesn't take long to get tired of Tex Ritter's sing-song drawl.  But the use of clocks for suspense, particularly in the climactic montage, is a masterstroke.HIGH NOON ranks as one of the top ten westerns I have ever seen.  It is worthwhile renting for just about anyone, regardless of whether they are fans of the genre.Rating *** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"12 November 1999","score":"11 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":"  Life was going well for Will Kane, Hadleyville's town marshal.

The dialogue in this movie mirrors the conversations that several level-headed, reverent Catholics and Christians have shared around and with me. No pentagrams on our family dinner table; there is honest, open discussion and topics in this movie are not picketed outside our house.Beyond the controversy stirred up outside the theater lies a roaringly funny movie inside. Smith is able to put together an interesting story line full of humorous lines as well as some developmental dialogue to keep the story moving along. On a couple of occasions the feel got a bit preachy (particularly during the train scene) and a few minutes probably could have been shaved off the final running time, but all in all, it's a good ride.Fiorentino gives a fine performance as a woman confused by her faith and even further confused by the mission her faith sends her on. Damon and Affleck did a bang-up job as the renegade angels; they were a welcome presence on the screen. Jason Mewes takes the cake for inducing humor, mainly because his toilet talk is a real contrast to much of what is spoken here. Silent Bob is nearly as funny with his facial expressions.It was nice to see Jeff Anderson back on the big screen, but he barely opened his mouth -- a travesty for Randal Graves' fans. Jason Lee also (surprisingly) suffered from an underwritten part, but he did well with the little time he had. George Carlin and Bud Cort also took advantage of their small roles. And Alanis wasn't bad.Nothing spectacular about the filming of this one, but as always, it's the characters that make Kevin Smith's movies sing. Fearing letdown on my way in, I left the theater thinking that a.) what in the world was there to protest?; b.) the movie only dragged twice, which wasn't bad for a movie running 125 minutes; c.) Smith did a great job piecing together a complex story line while (here's the key part) keeping the shock value limited to Jason Mewes' mouth. And how surprising is it to hear Jay talk about getting' with the women?Shame on Miramax for cowering away from such a great film. I hope Lions Gate sees a decent return on this, and I hope the Weinsteins continue to wimp out on good films so we no longer have to endure their Oscar campaigning. A 7\/10, losing some points for the two slow moments and preachy dialogue by Chris Rock at one point.

Salma Hayek is better than her usual roles. In this movie she plays a smart muse, while in Wild Wild West, she was a dumb muse (by the way, in WWW her talent was completely wasted). Jason Lee (Azriel-the devil), George Carlin (Cardinal Glick), Jason Mewes (non-stop talking Jay) and Chris Rock (Rufus-the 13th apostle) are doing great jobs and contribute enormously to the movie. Linda Fiorentino is perfect as the world's saviour and Alan Rickman (Metatron) gives a marvelous performance as a cynical angel (his scene concerning tequila drinking-and then spewing it back, and the extremely funny pants-down scene are very original). Ben Affleck and Matt Damon have lots of chemistry (that's not a surprise, we know how well they got along in Good Will Hunting) and are competent as outcast angels Bartleby and Loki. But the real gem of this movie is Alanis Morissette. Though she does not say anything, her screen presence is overwhelming.

Seth Green reprises his role as Scott,Evils wonderfully dysfunctional son,and while the scenes with his dad lack some of the bite they did in the original,Green(and his hair)is still very good.

He also had quite a good body of completely original comedies.So what happened?We had Blazing Saddles, which borrowed from every western ever made and knocked down the wall between the audience and the film. We had Young Frankenstein, which successfully lampooned the Frankenstein films, yet had an original story line and a fantastic slew of performers who, well, performed -- brilliantly. Even the off-kilter and uneven History of the World Part I was hilarious in parts, and was original throughout.But Robin Hood Men in Tights suffers from the same maladies as another recent Brooks film, Dracula Dead and Loving It. Its plot is lifted entirely from another movie; in this case, the other movie is Robin Hood Prince of Thieves. Brooks changes nary a plot line, lifts practically the whole set of characters, and adds maybe 50 jokes. 4 of those are funny.With the exception of Cary Elwes and Brooks himself, the acting is horrible, especially by Amy Yasbeck, who plays Maid Marian. This is no surprise, since she was equally disastrous in Dracula Dead and Loving It.Brooks' humor doesn't seem pointed or hip any more, even though his older films stand up to the test of time quite well. He just hasn't got that edge that he had then. In fact, he hasn't had it since before Spaceballs, which was the beginning of the end as far as I can tell.
