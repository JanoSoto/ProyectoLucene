All pretensions aside, this is a haunted house movie, and as a basic idea it's not too bad.  Unfortunately the director falls down by following few or no rules of any ghost story - suspense is rare, tension is low, and to be honest, some of the adverts I saw before the trailers had better technique.  Instead (apart from some pretty heavy gore) the only scare-factor used is that of the fast cut (i.e. a heck of a lot of quick shots in sequence, showing a ghost going 'Boo' or something from different angles).  Terrifying. Obviously, the film isn't so bad in isolation, it's just that the whole thing has been done far better before.  The make up is excellent, the special effects are pretty nifty, and the set is superb.  The acting is so-so, at its worst in the sickly sweet opening titles, but there are some good moments.  Even the plot has a convincing twist or two.  The ghosts are pretty well handled, only some are pretty unconvincing, which doesn't help matters.  It's at least nice to see some depth being added to the characters...if only the film was just more interesting.

See hilarious comedy... should not be missed!This film was great in many ways but always there is a bad point in which you must loose a mark out of 10 for, this is the acting, but in lots of comedys you cant act you must be funny so no comedy would be likely to get 10\/10. All because there are either people voting who have no taste in pure hilarious comedy. Or because of the acting in which has to be poor to make it funny.Leslie Nielsen also made a laugh echo over britain and the US as he played a characteristic comic character in Airoplane!

Bad puns about the name aside, Sexy Beast successfully fuses elements of several different types of movies together with some brilliant performances and interesting direction.\tEven the crew and actors behind the film are unsure of how to classify Sexy Beast, and the film's spreading over multiple genres does make it a tad difficult.  At its heart it's a simple crime story, of an ex-con gone clean having to go back for one more job.  Though this basic theme is simple, built off of it are elements of romance (the love of an ex-con for his wife, who doesn't want him to do the job), suspense (ex-con doesn't want to do the job, other con has to convince him, through any means necessary), and even a few lines of comedy.  Unlike other films that try to blend multiple genres, Sexy Beast doesn't seem unbalanced at all; the comedy is so slight that it never overwhelms the serious aspects, and all else is built evenly off the main story.  The fact that the film is 90 minutes may seem worrisome on paper, but the film isn't too short and never feels rushed (a definite problem amongst good movies that are less than two hours).\tBesides proper balancing, the film's multiple elements are able to work because of excellent leading performances.  Although his accent occasionally becomes so thick as to require closed captioning, Ray Winstone has great romantic chemistry with Amanda Redman and general chemistry with Ben Kingsley and other co-stars.  He comes off as a genuine good guy, who genuinely loves his life and wife and would never leave them.  When Kingsley's Don Logan gets into an angry confrontation, the atmosphere quickly becomes chilling, as his imposing nature overshadows his character's simple dialogue (such duality being the reason some have labeled the film a black comedy).  He also comes off as genuinely crazy, with enough screws loose that it's surprising when he becomes even more furious over the course of the film.  Yet even underneath such a hard shell, there are traces of a lacking self-confidence, which perhaps is what fuels his fire.  Kingsley brings such power and emotion to a character that essentially does nothing more than cuss throughout the entire movie.\tThe direction is also classy, leading to some interesting shots.  The most interesting of these is during a crashing one-boulder rockslide; as the boulder begins to roll, it is shot from the boulder's position, only to switch back to an oblivious Winstone, where the rock barely misses him and crashes into his swimming pool.  More excellent direction occurs in an underwater sequence later.  The only sequences that lack a true sense of belonging are those involving the film's titular beast; it is obvious the beast is a metaphor for something, but it's never made clear exactly what.  Such sequences come off as rather curious and unnecessary.\tSexy Beast includes many different film aspects, compelling characters, and excellent direction.  Although occasionally the accents or foul language become too much, it is still one of the more interesting and better done films of the past couple years.

The fact that the film is 90 minutes may seem worrisome on paper, but the film isn't too short and never feels rushed (a definite problem amongst good movies that are less than two hours).\tBesides proper balancing, the film's multiple elements are able to work because of excellent leading performances.  Although his accent occasionally becomes so thick as to require closed captioning, Ray Winstone has great romantic chemistry with Amanda Redman and general chemistry with Ben Kingsley and other co-stars.  He comes off as a genuine good guy, who genuinely loves his life and wife and would never leave them.  When Kingsley's Don Logan gets into an angry confrontation, the atmosphere quickly becomes chilling, as his imposing nature overshadows his character's simple dialogue (such duality being the reason some have labeled the film a black comedy).  He also comes off as genuinely crazy, with enough screws loose that it's surprising when he becomes even more furious over the course of the film.  Yet even underneath such a hard shell, there are traces of a lacking self-confidence, which perhaps is what fuels his fire.  Kingsley brings such power and emotion to a character that essentially does nothing more than cuss throughout the entire movie.\tThe direction is also classy, leading to some interesting shots.  The most interesting of these is during a crashing one-boulder rockslide; as the boulder begins to roll, it is shot from the boulder's position, only to switch back to an oblivious Winstone, where the rock barely misses him and crashes into his swimming pool.  More excellent direction occurs in an underwater sequence later.  The only sequences that lack a true sense of belonging are those involving the film's titular beast; it is obvious the beast is a metaphor for something, but it's never made clear exactly what.  Such sequences come off as rather curious and unnecessary.\tSexy Beast includes many different film aspects, compelling characters, and excellent direction.

Bad puns about the name aside, Sexy Beast successfully fuses elements of several different types of movies together with some brilliant performances and interesting direction.\tEven the crew and actors behind the film are unsure of how to classify Sexy Beast, and the film's spreading over multiple genres does make it a tad difficult.  At its heart it's a simple crime story, of an ex-con gone clean having to go back for one more job.  Though this basic theme is simple, built off of it are elements of romance (the love of an ex-con for his wife, who doesn't want him to do the job), suspense (ex-con doesn't want to do the job, other con has to convince him, through any means necessary), and even a few lines of comedy.

When I first saw it I was blown away with many aspects of the film, notably the special effects, cinematography and the philosophical message contained within. I went out and bought it on VHS and have just gotten around to buying it on DVD along with the recently released companion DVD 'The Matrix Revisited.' As such, this review is a retrospective - it assumes you've seen the movie, although it does not contain spoilers.As I said, The Matrix was truly ground breaking. As a fan of comic books in my youth, I immediately recognised the stylized characters and settings - it was a blast from start to finish. The Special effects were mind boggling - the slow motion scenes using the 'bullet time' effect were innovative and hadn't been seen before.After repeated viewings, my opinions have changed slightly. No longer do the effects totally amaze me - we can see the bullet time effect on everything now from TV ads to comedy movies (e.g. Scary Movie.) This doesn't take anything away from the movie in itself, it just lessens the impact.The cinematography looks as good as it did the first time I saw it and is truly the greatest thing about The Matrix. It's like the directors decided to ignore the rules of what you can do with a camera and just dreamed up angles and shots straight from a comic book where imagination is the only limit. Each time I watch it, I'm truly stunned by the sheer inventiveness of these guys - there are few films that come close.As for the plot and messages within the movie - I'm sot so sure. The idea that we live in a construct and are slaves to the system isn't new - films such as 'They Live' or 'Solyent Green' (and many others) covered this ground a long time ago, although admittedly without the eye candy. The quasi religious message within the movie is interesting but ultimately feels gimmicky, as if it was put there in order that fanboys like myself can endlessly discuss it on usenet. Don't get me wrong - better we have hidden messages and philosophies than a straight 'kill everything in sight' action flick - but at times it felt like it was being self consciously clever.And am I the only person who noticed the similarities between the plot and that of several 'Star Trek The Next Generation' episodes? You know, the ones where Picard and the crew leave the holodeck and return to the Enterprise, only to find that they are in fact still in the holodeck and they've been fooled? Sure, a Star Trek episode doesn't compare in it's depth or scope, but still, it takes something away from the idea that The Matrix plot is innovative and new.To finish, I must reiterate that this is a superb movie. However, my experiences with The Matrix tell me that special effects are seductive and can make the viewer feel as if a movie is better than it really is. There were times when I was enjoying them so much that I half believed Keanu Reeves could act, but after repeated viewings I took the red pill and woke up. Sure - the Matrix is excellent, but when the dust has settled and the effects aren't so stimulating - what do we have left? Stripped bare of eye candy - all we have is actors and plot. It should stand up on these merits alone, but does it? It's certainly a great film but an all time classic? I'm not sure, but I do know that I can't wait for the sequel - roll on The Matrix 2!!!

Mr. Cypher is trying to track down a lost contract, and hires private detective Harold Angel (Rourke).The film is brilliantly shot, darkness and light contrasted to excellent effect.  Fans, stairs and lifts keep appearing for no apparent reason, 'pinging' our senses for attention - symbols of a yet  darker and nastier turn ahead in the plot. Stifling heat add to the overall discomfort of the backdrop as Angel is thrown into a web of brutal murders and sinister connections. The casting is excellent, everyone is in the right place.  The cinematography is wonderful and the overall attention to detail is superb. Both Mickey Rourke and DeNiro are on top form, trying to 'out-do' each other.Lisa Bonet is every bit as effective in her lesser role.  Having grown up with her as the sweet, innocent, young actress from the Cosby Show I was more than a little surprised.Rourke carries the film along cleverly and sincerely against a backdrop of dysfunctional characters and locations. As we watch Angel's life go to pieces he is thrown from one situation to another in the quest for the lost contract.This is a superb combination of detective\/horror story.
