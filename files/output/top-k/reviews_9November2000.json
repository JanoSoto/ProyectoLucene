So when I heard about this film I was interested in seeing it.  A few days ago I rented Velvet Goldmine and watched it.  I thought it was quite good and entertaining and was very impressed by the performances of McGregor and Bale. Although the use of new songs in glam style annoyed me a bit, I loved that they did use many originals from the 70s by people like Brian Eno, Roxy Music, Mick Ronson and Lou Reed. I found myself thinking of the film over and over later that day and eventually looking it up here and then on other places online. I woke up the next morning thinking about it, which is extremely unusual for me.  Images from the film kept coming back to me all day and then I thought I'd look at those scenes again for a few minutes the next day..something I've never done before.  So I put the tape in meaning to fast forward it, but I got caught up in those fabulous opening credits.  Fast paced editing and action, colorful clothes on kids having fun and Eno's song really catch you up into the film (after that short but odd 'Wilde is from outer space' stuff).  From there I found myself standing beside the TV watching the whole film again.  And the second time I saw it I REALLY loved it!  It was even better viewing it again.  Although I found Rhys-Meyers quite cold and uninvolving, many of the other actors turned in great work.  McGregor just threw himself into this part and electrified the screen.  And Bale was believable as a 17 year old innocent boy and a jaded 27 year old man...which is a very difficult act to pull off credibly.My favorite parts of the film were 1) the sequence from when Curt and Brian drink a toast in a fantasy press conference to when Brian's ex-wife Mandy tells the Arthur who she found in bed together. and 2) when Arthur meets Curt in a flashback at the 70s concert till the end of the film.  I found that second part very emotionally moving to see when I watched the film a second time.  And it was so sad to see the bright and hopeful world of the 70s become the bleak and drab world of the 80s when they showed the 'present time' vs the flashbacks throughout the movie.I can't wait to see Velvet Goldmine again! Rarely do I ever buy videotapes, but this one I gotta own so I can watch it repeatedly.

One is to be entertained and the other is to be informed.  Sometimes being entertained is all we ask, as is the case of most summer movies.  Then at times we are lucky enough to be entertained and informed.  Films like Malcolm X, American History X, Saving Private Ryan are a few that come to mind.  Films like that dealt with important historical and social issues.  They opened my eyes to injustices of the past and the present and they did an excellent job of keeping me entertained in the process.  The Legend Of Bagger Vance on the other hand informed me in a different way.  It taught me a great deal about golf and some of it's history.  And it entertained me a great deal.  You see, for me, golf is now a great interest to me just as it is for a great many new fans.  Since Tiger Woods has transcended the sport and became iconoclastic, my interest in golf has multiplied exponentially.  Toss in a good Canadian prodigy named Mike Weir and I am now hooked on the sport.  I was even fortunate enough to see Tiger and Mike play at Glen Abbey this year where Mike had a difficult weekend and all Tiger did was win the triple crown for only the second time in the history of golf.  It was quite an event.Golf is different than any sport, and that is because it is a gentleman's game.  There is a level of integrity and honesty to it.  You are responsible for keeping your own score and you are expected to uphold the rules of the game even when no one is there to govern you.  Could you imagine in hockey if you hooked a man from behind and the ref didn't see it, you then went up to him and said,  look, I just took down Joe and I deserve two minutes in the box for that?  Or if in football, you told the ref that you didn't really make the catch, that the ball touched the ground first?  It is unheard of.  But not in golf.  Not only is it your responsibility, it is your oath to do so, because if one wins the game of golf without integrity, then one is not a real man.  I realize how surreal that sounds, but it is so true.  Your victory would be tarnished and that would stay etched in your mind forever.  That is one of ( but certainly not the only ) the beauties of golf.  Such is one of the themes of this film.  Golf is the back drop and it deals with issues such as these but it is a film about much more.Critics have criticized the film for being too shallow and not containing enough substance, but I vehemently disagree.  You have to look for what this is about at times, but believe me it is there.  Will Smith plays Bagger Vance in by far his most in depth performance.  Smith is known more for his comedic roles and his propensity for box office success where as Matt Damon has had success box office wise as well, but not nearly the kind that Will has.  Yet he is known more for his great layered performances in films like Good Will Hunting and The Talented Mr. Ripley.  However, in Bagger Vance, Smith steals every scene he is in with Damon.  This is a performance that is worthy of an Oscar nod as best supporting actor thus far.  He is that good.Bagger Vance is a character that comes into Rannulph Junnah's ( Damon ) life just as he's entered into a golf tournament against the two best golfers of their era, Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones.  Junnah was once a revered golfer but then went to WWII and came back a scarred man.  He never regained his swing and now he flounders in a sea of confusion and drinks his life away.  He is given this one chance at greatness again because of a young boy's belief in him.  The town is sponsoring a $10,000 dollar golf tournament in the middle of the Great Depression but it will only back it if one of their home grown talents will compete.  Hardy Greaves is a young boy of maybe 12, and he remembers when Junnah was the best golfer the south had ever known.  He tells the mayor and all the other town folk that he can get Junnah to play.  He doesn't disappoint.  He convinces Junnah that he can get his swing back again, with a little practise.  One night as Junnah is attempting in vain to regain his stroke, Bagger Vance comes walking into his life out what seems to be nowhere.  Somehow a conversation is started and Bagger Vance ends up being Junnah's caddy for the big match.  Now where did this man come from?  How did he get here and why is here?  These questions are never answered but most people that I know and have talked to about the film think he is a guardian angel of sorts.  Was he sent here just so Junnah could regain his stroke?  Perhaps.  Maybe God really does love golf that much.  But maybe he was sent here not only to help Junnah with his game, but to help him with his life.  Golf is like the art of Zen to some people and in here it is spoken of in the same reverence.  If Junnah is to regain all that he once was, he is going to have to get rid of all his inner demons.  And sometimes inner demons are a bitch to ostracize.Bagger Vance is very laconic in his approach to things.  He only says what needs to be said and the rest has to be learned.  In all of the teachings about golf that are preached about in this film, the same can be said for life in general.  This film captured me and filled me with a sense of....life.  It did to me what American Beauty did in some ways.  It is one of the best films to come out this year and it is steeped with rich and wonderful performances.  This should go down in the annals of film as one of the best sports films ever made.  And of course Will Smith is wonderful.  I really think he will be looked upon differently in some circles after people see what he is capable of.But more importantly, this film taught me something about sport, golf in particular, but sports in general.  Even though Tiger has changed golf and there is a bit of swagger to it now with 5 million dollar purses and such, just take a minute sometime to take it all in.  Golf really is different than anything else.  In days when soccer fans are rabid enough to kill each other, hockey has people like Marty McSorley and one of the Niedermeyer boys head hunting with their sticks, football players celebrating voraciously and classlessly by slicing their throats with an imaginary knife, basketball players trash talking each other to the point of verboseness and the list can go on and on.  Fans of these sports can become rabid with their cataclysmic fanaticism and yet you watch the gallery in golf and you get a perspective of what it is all about.  When a golfer is about to take a shot, there is utter silence.  No one wants to disrespect any player, whether his name is Tiger Woods or a guy that is just hoping to qualify for Q-school.  You have fans that will not touch a golfer's ball when it goes out of bounds, they all understand the integrity of the sport.  Then there are the players.  They play side by side and wish each other well.  They want to play the game to the best of their ability but not at the expense of someone's integrity.  Player's respect one another, that can not be said in any other sport, not on the same level as golf.  As Bagger Vance says in the film, Golf is a game that can never be won, only played.  Words to live by. 9 out of 10.  This is one of the films to see this year.  Look for it to get some well deserved notirity in March.

Somehow a conversation is started and Bagger Vance ends up being Junnah's caddy for the big match.  Now where did this man come from?  How did he get here and why is here?  These questions are never answered but most people that I know and have talked to about the film think he is a guardian angel of sorts.  Was he sent here just so Junnah could regain his stroke?  Perhaps.  Maybe God really does love golf that much.  But maybe he was sent here not only to help Junnah with his game, but to help him with his life.  Golf is like the art of Zen to some people and in here it is spoken of in the same reverence.  If Junnah is to regain all that he once was, he is going to have to get rid of all his inner demons.  And sometimes inner demons are a bitch to ostracize.Bagger Vance is very laconic in his approach to things.  He only says what needs to be said and the rest has to be learned.  In all of the teachings about golf that are preached about in this film, the same can be said for life in general.  This film captured me and filled me with a sense of....life.  It did to me what American Beauty did in some ways.  It is one of the best films to come out this year and it is steeped with rich and wonderful performances.  This should go down in the annals of film as one of the best sports films ever made.  And of course Will Smith is wonderful.  I really think he will be looked upon differently in some circles after people see what he is capable of.But more importantly, this film taught me something about sport, golf in particular, but sports in general.  Even though Tiger has changed golf and there is a bit of swagger to it now with 5 million dollar purses and such, just take a minute sometime to take it all in.  Golf really is different than anything else.  In days when soccer fans are rabid enough to kill each other, hockey has people like Marty McSorley and one of the Niedermeyer boys head hunting with their sticks, football players celebrating voraciously and classlessly by slicing their throats with an imaginary knife, basketball players trash talking each other to the point of verboseness and the list can go on and on.  Fans of these sports can become rabid with their cataclysmic fanaticism and yet you watch the gallery in golf and you get a perspective of what it is all about.  When a golfer is about to take a shot, there is utter silence.  No one wants to disrespect any player, whether his name is Tiger Woods or a guy that is just hoping to qualify for Q-school.  You have fans that will not touch a golfer's ball when it goes out of bounds, they all understand the integrity of the sport.  Then there are the players.  They play side by side and wish each other well.  They want to play the game to the best of their ability but not at the expense of someone's integrity.  Player's respect one another, that can not be said in any other sport, not on the same level as golf.  As Bagger Vance says in the film, Golf is a game that can never be won, only played.  Words to live by. 9 out of 10.  This is one of the films to see this year.  Look for it to get some well deserved notirity in March.

The movie manages to keep both newcomers and old readers satisfied.Perhaps some may argue about acting, for usually there is not enough space left to act in science fiction movies (which by the way is not what I think at all. Just the usual comment I keep hearing now and then.) I really liked certain mimics of characters, most especially Wolverine's.

Freddy represented the challenges that lie in wait for a kid who either chooses or inadvertently becomes a parent. Freddys desire to develop an attachment to Jacob is similar in the way that many people who, back in the late 80's when this was a major news story, were trying to take away the babies of these teens and treating them as though they were common street trash, lowlives who should be publicly punished for committing such an act.Alice has to overcome these obstacles created by human ignorance (something that helped create Freddy in the first place) and prove what her father, her friends, and herself already know that she will be a good parent and ,quite honestly, will be a better one than most of the parents in Springwood. She has already dealt with the problem the previous generation had created (Freddy) and, in turn, will benefit from that by using it deal with his return and any other negative occurances that may pop up over the coming years. Her knowledge becomes her power.Aside from the subtext, this chapter goes back to the dark aspect of the 1st and 3rd chapters as I said before, trying to make Freddy the evil creature he was in the first few and albeit somewhat less powerful since all of his souls had escaped in Part 4. The acting is very good, particularly from Lisa Wilcox, a great actress who unfortunately never received the big acting career she deserved.

Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic Sea on April 15, 1912.  The movie jumps from present day, to the day of that ill-fated voyage, then returns to the present day.  That unfortunate day begins with Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) winning a ticket to ride the Titanic back to America where he is from.  While on board, he meets Rose DeWitt Bukater (Winslet), a woman being forced to marry a man she does not love.  While on board, Jack and Rose develop a loving relationship, and spend all their time together hiding their feelings from all those who oppose.  Titanic follows the two as they fall in love, evade the jealous ex-fiancé, Cal Hockley (Zane), and eventually watch as their very short time begins to come to an end due to the sinking of the great Titanic. \tOf the many characters that went through changes in Titanic, I chose to discuss Rose DeWitt Bukater, and why she represents a three-dimensional character.  When we first are introduced to Rose, we get the impression that she is a little `rich bitch.'  She pulls up on the boarding dock in a caravan of new cars, welding a barrage of luggage.  When she first lays eyes upon Jack, who is on the lower deck with the rest of the `commoners', she has already formed her inferior opinion of him.  It is not until Jack stumbles onto Rose attempting to leap from the aft of the Titanic, and saves her, does she begin to realize that he is not inferior, and instead an interesting man.  Rose soon begins to fall in love with Jack, and this is where we see her change from that `rich bitch' to a caring, lovable woman.  We later find out that even though she let go of Jack by the end of the film, she carried the memory of him her entire life through the beautiful necklace she wore as Jack sketched her portrait.  \t Titanic is filled with irony, symbolism, and conflict.  The fact the Jack Dawson won his ticket to ride on Titanic, only to perish on it's very first voyage, is the first taste of irony that we experience.  Also, how heartbreaking is it that just after finding true love, they are split by the death of Jack?  Tragic.   \tThe greatest use of symbolism in Titanic occurs within the scene where Jack attends the dinner with Rose, Cal, and others.  This represents the life that Rose is bound to, and desperately seeking to escape.  The opposite happens when Jack takes Rose down to the lower deck, and we witness Rose expressing her most comfortable, newfound personality.  We also cannot forget the use of the diamond necklace.  The necklace ultimately represents Roses' undying love for Jack, which she has held onto all her life.  Only after she visits the wreckage of the Titanic is she finally ready to let go, and subsequently releases the necklace to the sea, and passes on in her sleep.   \tAs with many of James Cameron's films, Titanic uses numerous close up shots to convey intimacy.  A perfect example of this occurs in the scene when Jack is drawing the nude form of Rose.  Another technique that I feel James Cameron has mastered is the use of sound and\/or music in his films.  A right sound effect, or musical score as in Titanic, helps to complete that scary slasher scene, or that sad death scene, or even that scene where words just cannot express the right feeling as in that beautiful scene in Titanic when the lifeboat is being lowered with Rose inside.   \tThe film Titanic is such that in my opinion could be considered as having both a realistic and romantic ending.  The fact that Jack Dawson died at the end makes it a realistic ending; while having Rose walking to the rear of the ship to toss the ever symbolic diamond necklace into the night darkened sea creates the feeling of a romantic ending.   \tTitanic proves to not only push the envelope, but break it wide open with the masterful direction by James Cameron.  While Titanic's photography would reason to be realistic, it is by all accounts formalist.   The use of distorted camera angles, wide-angle shots, and camera movements make it such.   \tAs I earlier stated, the use of a great musical score in any film will make, or break that particular feeling the director wishes to convey.  It is said that realists films employ minimal musical scores, while formalist films come with big scores that are hard to ignore.  Titanic not only has the critically acclaimed `My Heart Will Go On' theme song, but many beautiful scores such as `Rose' and `Southampton' which, in this reviewers opinion, is the main reason this movie was as beautiful as it really was. \tCostuming for Titanic was definitely elaborate and by itself is another reason this film is considered a formalist film. \tLastly, the way the story and characters unfold is widely considered formalistic.  Formalist films are ones with courageous heroes (Jack) and beautiful women (Rose).  The story in Titanic took place on the biggest and most prestigious ocean liner ever built, which coincides with the fact that formalist films take place in exotic settings.  The only inconsistency that I have encountered with James Cameron's Titanic being measured a formalist film is the fact that it could be said that the film contains two different endings.  The first, by definition, could be considered realist because Jack Dawson ultimately died after the sinking.  Since the older Rose was shown tossing the necklace into the sea, achieving a final internal peace and showing that she is ready to let go and join Jack in the afterlife, it is my opinion this proves that it has a happy ending and hence should be referred to as formalist.

I'll grant that the acting was mediocre and the plot questionable at times, but this film had an enormous impact. I was reminded of the Greek tragedies and their inexorable element of Fate. As Oedipus was fated to do the unthinkable, these young students were fated to die in a plane crash. But Fate did not account for the psychic impulses of Alex, nor their effect on Clear or his compatriots.    I absolutely loved all of the conceptual elements of foreshadowing; the word Terminal flipping, the words Final Destination on the tag, the announcement of the Departure. Even moments in the dialogue which mentioned having the rest of one's life ahead of them simply pointed the finger towards an unfortunate end. Notice the subject of Clear's book at the airport, with its photos of Diana in the car crash...or Miss L's record...or all of the instances where Alex feels the presence of death. This film is incredible when it comes to suspense. I was literally holding my breath as I watched. It took me a good half hour to calm down afterward. And sleep? Ha. I couldn't fall asleep for hours.

Frankie and Annette are barely together even in the film--Frankie is more of a cameo than a major character in the plot.Intriguingly, this musical is filled with book numbers--where the characters sing when they should be talking.  Usually, the beach party movies just had people asking Frankie or Annette to sing at a party or at a nightclub.  So, that's a change.  The problem is that the songs aren't anything to write home about.Further, the film betrays why the beach movies were losing their popularity the surfing fad was being supplanted by a renewed interest in motorcycle culture.  Only a year or two later, American-International would be making films like The Wild Angels.  This is a problem for a series where the stock antagonist, Eric Von Zipper, is a parody of Marlon Brando's biker hood in The Wild One (1954).  The film shows a renewed interest in cycles--Annette's romantic interest, Harvey Lembeck, is an avid motorcyclist.  The film tries to deal with this by transforming Von Zipper from a biker into the stereotypical 60s junior executive (a la How to Succeed in Business).  But, you can see the structure starting to fall apart here.There are fun moments though--particularly the opening credits (clay animation done by Art Cloakey, the creator of Gumby), and the wacky motorcycle race at the end of the film.  Lastly, there's a fun cameo at the very end of the film by producer William Asher's wife...

For a historical reenactment, I suggest that you look elsewhere, for Braveheart is not one of those films, but for a romance\/action flick without any other value, I would wholeheartedly recommend it. It can be slow and even dragging at times, being that it was originally over 2 1\/2 hrs long, but the almost realistic battle scenes do make up for it.The one thing I didn't like was the one-dimensional characters; setting Wallace as ultimately good and Longshanks as ultimately villainous, etc. Sometimes during the film, Gibson's performance reminds me of a mechanical war-machine, rather than a human who can grow weary of fighting til the untimely end. It doesn't really give any dignity to the English royalty; making them out to be a bunch of spineless cowards, who would rather send their ladies to deal with their enemies, rather than facing them mono-e-mono. The story doesn't really explain why the queen's as fascinated with Wallace as she winds up being; it's almost like she's desperate for some well you know, after being married to a homosexual husband for so long, and dives in at the first moment. Oh and speaking thereof, since Longshanks' son is getting married, wouldn't he have seen the relationship between him and his in-the-closet lover severed before the marriage, instead of letting it go on, until suddenly he gets irritated with him, and flings him out the Castle's window? I think it would only be moral, but then again, what do I know?Anyhow, in the long run, for entertainment, it's really pretty good. It does flaws; most films do, but I'd make room on my shelf for this one.
