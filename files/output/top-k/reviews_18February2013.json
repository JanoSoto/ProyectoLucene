We then cut to our lead character, nicknamed The Lone Prospector, (or The Tramp) played by Chaplin himself, who is dapper, determined, but lonely as he attempts to hike towards riches in California from his homestate of Alaska. Along the way, trouble ensues from fellow gold-seekers, love blossoms with a local saloon girl (Georgia Hale), who may not feel as strongly as the prospector does, and many classic silent-era magic is created.Chaplin, who directed, wrote, produced, edited, and starred in this film said this would be his opus; the film he wanted to be remembered for and it would appear he got his wish. This is one of the quintessential Chaplin films, and it also serves as the first one I've ever seen. There is a delicate approach to the material, and even at the original ninety-six minutes, it's pretty short considering all the macro-material that was crammed into this film. Love, tragedy, persistency, determination, and finally, something resembling success.One of the things I've heard from Chaplin enthusiasts is that it's difficult to analyze his films as a whole; you're best bet is to take the funny scenes and go into what makes them funny said one of my closest friends, so I think I'll do that. Take for example, the iconic scene where Chaplin and his pal feast on his own shoe and laces. The scene was so spontaneous, unexpected, and downright absurd that it seemed the only proper thing to do was laugh at it all. Another scene would be the dance of the dinner rolls, where Chaplin takes two of his forks, stabs two dinner rolls, and allows them to sashay on the table at his control. It's the act and the approach that make these scenes funny. The question is simply 'why?' and if there were ever to be two perfect examples of functioning slapstick, these two would be it, not just for their absurdity, but their ability to stand alone as two great comic scenes.It's also apparent that this is a film that can merge slapstick and sentimentality to a functioning, non-manipulative formula that doesn't come crashing down on the audience. There's genuine emotion in this story; true feelings that come out and realism when the prospector realizes his love may be doomed, which is even sadder than not striking any gold. The way this part of the story is handled is sublime and commendable, fore it knows when to abandon slapstick in favor of a more serious approach.And who can forget the end, where the prospector and Big Jim, a fellow gold-seeker (Mack Swain) are trapped in the isolated cabin amidst high winds and merciless blizzard conditions that are sending the shack right off a cliff. This is one of the several scenes of the silent era in cinema that should be treasured and awed for its terrific effects work and brilliant execution. To be fair, the whole film should as well. It holds up, in its eighty-eight year, where all the jokes are still relevant, the only thing that has become dated is the style, and Chaplin's tour-de-force performance still shines if anything. How many films made today can you say that about in one hundred years? Starring Charlie Chaplin, Mack Swain, and Georgia Hale. Directed by Charlie Chaplin.

So with that that in mind those who have short attention spans, it's never too late to turn away now, but if those who can sit through the slow, progressive pace with patience and perseverance, this is truly a treasured movie for the ages. Back in the late 1970's there have been an influx of epic movies that went past the three hour mark. Even though the movie caters to a general audience, it's really not custom-made for everyone to enjoy. It has a cornucopia of genres thrown into the story like romance, drama, mystery, horror and most of all the triumphs and turmoil of the Vietnam War that was still haunting the United States even though the war ended three years before The Deer Hunter was released. Sure the facets of the film was centred around the concept of friendship, it also gave an insight of the Vietnam War and the physical and mental harm it affected the soldiers who fought in this war.The images captured in The Deer Hunter was extremely believable. There is no Hollywood concocting or glorifying the dreadful events of the Vietnam War and it doesn't have any artistic merit to the movie though the cinematography is quite sublime. The story often balances of congruency and at the same time it's off its kilter. The characters' development are not entirely coherent as there's little background provided for them and the psychological aspects are not very fulfilling either. What it does have is strong connections to the relationship of the characters which is based on friendship as each deserve our sympathy after what they've experienced during the Vietnam War. There's a lot of shock-value in the story and of course the one that sticks out is the infamous Russian Roulette scenario which was real and quite memorable in a not so good way.Robert DeNiro plays the leading role as Michael Vronsky, an introverted individual who only speaks if there's something that needs to be said and is smitten by a young lady named Linda (played by a young Meryl Streep). Linda plans on marrying Nick (Christopher Walken), who's friends with Mike while their other friend Steven (John Savage) and his new wife Angela (Rutanya Alda). The triad celebrate their enlisting into the Vietnam War. Meanwhile three other friends named Axel (Chuck Aspegren), Stanley (John Cazale) and John (George Dzundza) request to stay behind in the semi-condemned small town of Clairton, Pennsylvania as they anticipate their return. The alliance have quite a few similarities to one another. They all work in steel factory, they enjoy the sport of deer hunting and they all love a harmonious drink of beer. Again director Michael Cimino focuses on the realism of the settings and the characters. There are times when the movie has a few scenes where little action happens and are not in sync with the plot, but as long as they keep it real, is what makes it all the more settling.And just like you would expect on the effects of people who fought during the Vietnam War, psychological scarring takes place and the bonding of friendship begins to falter. The good moments are lost in the carnage as the friends try to rectify what was once the balance that brought them together. Michael is the balance of the scale as he tries to piece together the foundation of the three friends, but he could only do so much even though he deserves an A for effort. And the more he tries to be the peacemaker of the triad, the more frustrated he becomes as he can find no way to mend this once strong friendship that has now crumbled. Nick has become a shell of his former self as he's now become a prisoner of war for all to see. Steven is now a cripple and is now institutionalized by his wife.

One day, they all find a 500-foot crop circle in the middle of their corn field. All of this causes a media frenzy happening on nearly every single TV station as the family is about to encounter the extraterrestrial.'Signs' was the first Shyamalan movie that I've seen. Ever since I've watched it for the first time, it has been my favorite movie from Shyamalan. Right until I re-watched 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable'. After stating that 'Unbreakable' is now my favorite film from Shyamalan, does it mean that I disliked 'Signs' more than the first few times I've watched it? No; of course not. But I still do love this movie very much.Mel Gibson delivers a terrific performance as Graham Hess, the reverend that lost his faith after his wife died in a car accident.

You would get Army Of Darkness,a classic film that is an absolute blast from beginning to end. What I love about Th Evil Dead Trilogy is that while all three films are connected with one another,they're different in terms of tone. If Evil Dead was pure Horror and Evil Dead II was a Horror-Comedy,then Army Of Darkness is in the Action\/Comedy\/Fantasy category with a little bit of Horror thrown in. The Comedy and laughs in the film are hilarious and ingenious and over the top with Sam Raimi using Three Stooges-style Comedy and slapstick in the film and with the character Ash being apart of the joke going through many bizarre and crazy things on his adventure. Ash's journey of trying to get the book of the dead is definitely one of the film's many great and funny highlights,seeing Ash's many reactions to the evil forces around him trying to stop him from getting the book of the dead and the things Ash goes through is over the top and funny. What is also funny is that Ash not only has to deal with evil spirits but also has to deal with the leader of medieval swordsmen to battle the army of the dead and it is hilarious how he teaches and leads the swordsmen how to battle and not act like cowards. Watching Ash being a leader is funny but you as a viewer are rooting for him all the way. AOD is also an homage and parody of films like Jason And The Argonauts and the original Clash Of The Titans in terms of cinematic style and influence,it's an homage to those films but a parody as well especially with the dead skeleton army which is an homage to special effects artist Ray Harryhausen. The skeleton army in the film and the way they're used is absurd and funny and having the army talk and react makes them even funnier. If you love Ray Harryhausen you will AOD. The Action and fight scenes in the film are well-done and fun and add to the film,because the Action isn't always serious to the point when you have to laugh at the wild energy and insanity during the Action scenes and throughout the film. Despite being a sequel to the first two Evil Dead films,some fans maybe a little disappointed to find out that AOD is the lightest film in the Evil Dead trilogy,meaning this film is less of a Horror film and more of Action\/Comedy\/Fantasy. Where the first two films were Horror films and had blood and gore,AOD was more of an adventure that didn't really need blood or gore because if AOD had that the film would've had a different tone to it and like I said before one of the things I love about the Evil Dead trilogy is that they're all different in tone,if you keep an open mind you'll love all the Evil Dead films including this one because like the first two film AOD has the same crazy and insane energy that the first two had. The ending of the film is a great,Action-packed and very exciting conclusion that will have viewers clapping and cheering at the screen and is one of the reasons that the Evil Dead films,Bruce Campbell and Ash are so legendary and iconic and in the immortal words of Ash it's...groovy.The cast does a great job. Bruce Campbell is excellent once again as Ash,bringing laughs,Action,toughness and great one-liners. Embeth Davidtz is wonderful and beautiful as Shelia,Ash's love interest. Marcus Gilbert gives a good performance as Lord Arthur and plays it straight. Ian Abercrombie is great as the Wiseman. Richard Grove is wonderful in his small role as Duke Henry The Red. Also lookout for cameos from Bridget Fonda(Linda)and Ted Raimi(S-Mart Store Clerk).The direction by Sam Raimi is excellent with Raimi with Raimi going nuts with the camera especially with the POV shots of the demons,the tilted angles and Raimi also does well with the Action scenes. Great job,Raimi.The score by Joseph LoDuca is wonderful and great sounding and fits in with the tone of the film. Great score. Also,lookout for a score cameo from Danny Elfman.The special make-up effects by K.N.B are well-done,memorable and very realistic.

Bruce Greenwood is utterly believable as President Kennedy and was a bit of inspired casting, and Steven Culp makes an excellent Bobby Kennedy. The latter's performance deserves special mention, I feel, as Culp is otherwise a relative unknown, someone who has a long list of walk on parts in numerous TV series from The Cosby Show to Grey's Anatomy, yet is not exactly a familiar name or face.As a drama it is enjoyable to follow and achieves real dramatic tension during critical moments, which is a tricky act to pull off in any story when one already knows the end (if not, Google 'Cuban Missile Crisis'!)I was not left with an impression of having watched a high end movie, it left more of an impression of a high quality TV drama-documentary. In short I liked it!

Personally I actually think it is a good thing that the James Bond franchise was forced to dump SPECTRE because by this time the whole SPECTRE plot was starting to get a little thin (Blofeld has another plan to take over the world, but Bond stops him, though Blofeld manages to escape by the skin of his teeth).. Now they are forced to resort of other things, and I guess by doing this has made James Bond the success that it is.The beginning of the film has three agents murdered, one in New Orleans, one in New York, and one in a small Caribbean island. As such James Bond (who is in bed with an Italian Agent that has gone missing, though Miss Moneypenny is nice enough not to reveal her existence to M) is called in to solve the problem. One must feel sorry for Bond though because he is home alone was a lovely Italian secret agent when M and Miss Moneypenny burst in and give him his new orders and tells him that he has to leave immediately (though he seems to always have enough time for a quick roll in the hay).This used to be one of my favourite Bond movies, namely because of the extended speedboat chase that they had near the end of the film, however these days I find myself simply drifting through the movie waiting for this scene. Also, it seemed to me that it involved some scenes that were simply tacked together. The whole New Orleans\/Louisianna episode simply seemed to be placed in there to make the movie longer than it would have been (though the speed boat chase, as well as the chase with the airplanes at the airport do add spice to the film).The other thing I found a bit odd, and it sort of killed my suspension of disbelief, was when Bond stumbled upon the heroin plantation. I actually did not realise that it was Heroin until they mentioned that it was Heroin because, honestly, when they first showed it, it looked like Cocaine. I even wonder if they grow Opium Poppies in the Caribbean because I always thought that it was grown mostly in Thailand and the Middle East.

Hold on a minute, there was a library in Cluedo, wasn't there? There's no library in the Gosford Park house. At least, I didn't see one... Whatever, the point being that there is a murder at the core of this lavish, period piece from 2001 and a handful of people of varying genders; backgrounds; nationalities and classes all caught up in this stately locale facing down the barrel of a charge. Alas, I wanted to like the film more than I did; eventually finding myself to be worn down by the film's run time and its excessive amount of characters depicted therein, where in the past I have often taken to Altman projects feeding off such things. And yet it doesn't have any right to often be as engaging as it sometimes is - unlike a game of Cluedo, the death at the heart of Gosford Park is inconsequential; it is ultimately about the people and the talking, the dialogue driven scenes depicting a bygone British class system nattering away about not much in particular but doing well to side us with the perspective of a young female maid engaging with her infirm, snobbish elderly boss. I wanted a film about them. In a sense, we get one; in another sense, it isn't anything to do with them. The imbalance is cause for frustration.Dignitaries of all sorts and of differing ilks are gathering at a huge country estate in 1930's England; they're there for a weekend of hunting and whatnot at the behest of their host, Michael Gambon. Like most of Gambon's characters, the host is brash and loud and swans around the place coming across as being in control without necessarily having to do much. He likes to shoot birds for sport; enjoys the presence of the young female maids at his home (especially when they're wearing what they wear) and isn't generally much in the way of a bang-up guy. The ship that is the manor house is run so tightly under his watch, that should certain maids be caught on the incorrect storey, severe ramifications would unfold.All is not well away from the host and his friends either. Within certain couples staying at the lodge for the duration, arguments are arising and there is a general sense of both distrust and unease amongst everyone as this disparate congealed unit consisting of this body of personnel gear up for exquisite dinners; rich company and the pleasures that apparently come with being able to go out on a hunt and shoot stuff the sort of things that need to run smoothly so as to even have a hope of working. A good deal of it does consist of people both sitting and standing around; talking, eating, arguing and switching between their public personas and private personas faces and attitudes their friends know them for, as well as such things for which their closer peers know them. When the time comes for Gambon's character to die at the bereft of one of those present, there is room for most to be a suspect; in spite of Altman's guile to cut to a specific few people looking shifty and suspicious as they re-enter the lounge wherein everybody congregated away from the crime scene.For most, the idea of a film wherein a lone murder doesn't have to, or need to, constitute as the focal point around which the entire film must hinge will sound like a masterstroke of film-making; pacing, et al. I found it engaging without being riveting, a matter of style over substance for a great deal of its time. The film is more a snapshot of what a smattering of folks, typical to 1930's Great Britain, at a manor retreat for a weekend of hunting and fine dining might resemble. The rummaging around for a narrative; an event anything gives way to something as jarring as a death that's not even the focal point of the piece in the first place. We don't mind this, of course, but apart from Kelly Macdonald's scenes with her elderly employer, played by Maggie Smith, we are scrapping around for scant consolation in terms of plot and character, with these specific sequences becoming beacons upon which we grasp for any kind of interest. Macdonald is better than what her job says she is someone curious where curiosity in a young woman is frowned upon; someone outgoing and looking to engage, someone working for Smith's character not out of respect or because Smith can boss her around with consummate ease (although she does), but because she comes cheap. There is an amusing self-aware, sub-The Player skit nearer the beginning of the film, arriving in the form of an American character pitching an idea for a detective story which eerily begins to sync up with what's transpiring before everyone something with a similarly subversive idea to that of The Player, but not unfolding in a film quite as good.

Every teenager dreams of skipping school and Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) does just that. In this 1986 teenage comedy, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, a not so innocent teenager nearing the end of his high school career, ditches school and, with best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara), embark on an adventure to the Windy City of Chicago. With the upcoming obstacles of college, Bueller plans a day of shenanigans in hopes of saving Cameron. Little does Bueller know that his sister, Jeanie Bueller (Jennifer Grey), and principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) would do everything in their power to make sure that the so called perfect child would be caught red-handed.Jeanie Bueller and Principal Ed Rooney didn't expect that catching the famous Ferris Bueller was going to be easier said than done. Along the way, they themselves dig into deeper trouble, even with the law! Running through neighbor's yards, encountering a gruesome rottweiler, and maybe even a little romance with a young, troubled teen (Charlie Sheen). What else could possibly go wrong? Throughout this movie, it is hard for anyone to despise Ferris. His young, seemingly childish attitude that never gets him in trouble appeals to everyone. He never ceases to address the audience with a sarcastic, funny side note as if we are apart of his scheme. By the end of this movie, the audience will see Ferris develop on so many levels. He even goes as far as taking the blame for something he didn't do, even if that means being caught. Matthew Broderick comes through with his best performance to date.Although Cameron, much more reserved than Bueller, is a bit skeptical of Bueller's mischief, he slowly warms up to the idea of fun and even does the unexpected. Yet throughout this movie he never seems to wear more than three expressions. It's not until the end that the audience sees the true Cameron that has been bottled up. Will his father ever open his heart to his son? Sloane Peterson plays the perfect girl for the wild and unpredictable Ferris Bueller. She's able to keep Ferris in check and temporarily out of trouble, yet she still plays along with his shenanigans. Together they balance out to the perfect high school relationship.John Hughes, director of the famous 16 Candles and The Breakfast Club, adds another memorable and comedic piece to his repertoire. Through the cultivation of every teenager's dream and the development of these characters, John Hughes certainly delivers. Anyone looking for countless laughs should indulge in this one of a kind teenage comedy.

Little does Bueller know that his sister, Jeanie Bueller (Jennifer Grey), and principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) would do everything in their power to make sure that the so called perfect child would be caught red-handed.Jeanie Bueller and Principal Ed Rooney didn't expect that catching the famous Ferris Bueller was going to be easier said than done. Along the way, they themselves dig into deeper trouble, even with the law! Running through neighbor's yards, encountering a gruesome rottweiler, and maybe even a little romance with a young, troubled teen (Charlie Sheen). What else could possibly go wrong? Throughout this movie, it is hard for anyone to despise Ferris. His young, seemingly childish attitude that never gets him in trouble appeals to everyone. He never ceases to address the audience with a sarcastic, funny side note as if we are apart of his scheme. By the end of this movie, the audience will see Ferris develop on so many levels. He even goes as far as taking the blame for something he didn't do, even if that means being caught. Matthew Broderick comes through with his best performance to date.Although Cameron, much more reserved than Bueller, is a bit skeptical of Bueller's mischief, he slowly warms up to the idea of fun and even does the unexpected. Yet throughout this movie he never seems to wear more than three expressions. It's not until the end that the audience sees the true Cameron that has been bottled up. Will his father ever open his heart to his son? Sloane Peterson plays the perfect girl for the wild and unpredictable Ferris Bueller. She's able to keep Ferris in check and temporarily out of trouble, yet she still plays along with his shenanigans. Together they balance out to the perfect high school relationship.John Hughes, director of the famous 16 Candles and The Breakfast Club, adds another memorable and comedic piece to his repertoire. Through the cultivation of every teenager's dream and the development of these characters, John Hughes certainly delivers. Anyone looking for countless laughs should indulge in this one of a kind teenage comedy.

In the other vehicle, a ute, in the back, stands our bloodthirsty madman, operating the chainsaw. So when the cars draw level, we have quite a hairy scene. The radio lass teams up with Hopper to take down these freaks. We do have some quite genuinely terrifying scenes, that take place in an underground lair of Leatherface's. A sort of trophy room, but not as much gore as you'd think, but when presented, it's genuinely grisly. I just feel somehow I got short changed here.

However, if you are looking for something that is primarily action (ie Black Hawk Down) you won't find it in Pearl Harbor. Though this movie mainly focuses on the relationships of Danny, Rafe and Evelyn, I think something more in depth is being examined. Since the story of Pearl Harbor is told through the relationships of the main characters, the movie really becomes personal. As you watch and observe how the war affects those who are participants, and those who are loved ones of the participants, you begin to better understand and gain an appreciation for the difficulty that those who fought and still do fight for our country went\/go through. Pearl Harbor reveals the hardships and horror of war and the toll it takes on those directly involved. Most war movies I have watched are mostly focused on the fighting, bombing, etc. While those movies may be interesting to watch one time on a weekend movie night, they have not stuck in my mind. Pearl Harbor is an emotional film that goes deeper than the action and really leaves an impact on the watcher. Don't let the 3 hours deter you from watching this film either! Its one of those movies that you want to continue on for a good length of time. Plus, this amount of time is needed in the movie to fully develop the plot. I honestly cannot praise this movie enough!

His courageous and famous lawyer want's to save him because he thinks that the boy didn't kill anyone.The only thing left is mental illness so a shrink is there to diagnose him. The shrink discovers his problem split personalities. IF THIS IS TRUE THAN THE BOY DOESN'T END UP IN JAIL BUT IN A MENTAL INSTITUTE , JUST GET A COUPLE OF OTHER DOCTORS TO PROVE THIS AND CASE CLOSED.Here is our plot hole together with the twist  twist- split personalities (good twist but raises questions afterwards)plot hole - can't prove the split personalities (not true because all the lawyer should do is ask the judge and a couple of doctors can come and give a final decision about the kid )Instead of asking other doctors Veil thinks he should prove that in the courtroom like it a show of some kind. Here we are in the courtroom the kid is being asked by the prosecution lawyer where he gets up punches his own lawyer and threaten that he will break the prosecution lawyers neck. Now everybody is convinced because of that little show that the kid is actually sick NO REAL PROOF NO DOCTORS.In the final scene the kid appears to be normal and everything was a show for him to escape the punishment.So this is the second twist and plot hole twist - no split personalities hole - no doctor actually proved anything of this kind being or not being split personalities, and the jury doesn't need any more evidence because they are all doctors and they know what they are doing.So in conclusion this movie tries to be smart but it falls in it's own thinking. Actors are really good but they look bad from the writers.I understood who was the murder in the moment where the boy talked about his mental illness or when he gave that hateful look to the shrink. At that moment I started hating the movie not because I knew that but because of the twist that were major plot holes that made those good actors look stupid.

Restrained, serious and at times quite dark, this is a film for people who want depth in their films.Three sister, all who have problems of their own are suddenly having to deal with their parents divorce.

Renata is a successful writer married to a one hit writer, Sam Waterston as Mike.Joey is trying to find a creative outlet but she is not as talented as her older sister and Flyn is an actress in second rate TV shows and movies.Joey is the one who ends up having to care for her mentally ill mother and is filled with frustration and resentment.

These people are not always likable, except for Pearl. But there are times when the viewer can feel sympathy for them.I don't understand why this film garnered so many negative reviews.

That being said, The Lost World  Jurassic Park (1997), the second movie in the Jurassic Park series is a complete step back for the franchise.I did enjoy the first movie, Jurassic Park (1993) - rated a 7 \/10.Disappointing movie which should be avoided by most movie lovers.PLOT Like watching a teen slasher movie, you sit and wonder why the characters are so god-damn stupid in this movie. Too many plot holes to count, utter garbage.DIALOG Seemed very unnatural for the situations encountered. The dry, dead pan delivery of Goldblum quips is terrible.- I was bothered by the total unrealistic way the characters behaved, and impossibility of character actions. (Sure, Julianne Moore's character can run carrying a 150 pound baby dinosaur in her arms like a bread loaf)- The suspension of disbelief is broken by sloppy directing and poor writing. WORST SCENE < 80 lb. pre-teen girl gymnast swing kicks a Raptor through a second story window to be impaled below.BEST SCENE Jeff Goldblum, running from a raptor, opens a door and runs into a small building, raptor jumps through a window into the building, Goldblum hastily opens door again and exits the building. Goldblum was PERFECT in this scene. His expressions were fantastic, it was very funny.- One of the protagonists (played by Vince Vaughn) is a conservationist\/ eco-terrorist whose deliberate actions causes the deaths of most of the characters in the movie. It bothered me that he was NOT portrayed as a villain or at the least a misguided fool. He is not held accountable for his actions.- I wish overt political messages could be kept out of more movies.If you are a PETA lover then maybe you think it is just that a hunter who shocks a small dinosaur to get the animal to leave deserves to be painfully killed by a large pack of the same dinosaurs later. It bothers me that the movie masses are supposed to feel his death is vindication. The movie can provide simple escapist action to young viewers and others who do not like to think while watching movies.ACTORSI thought the acting fine.Jeff Goldblum continues to seem out of place and unnatural in an action role. (Independence Day (1996) is another huge stinker that he helped bury.) He should stick to Wes Anderson type films. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"}]
