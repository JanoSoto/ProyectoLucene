In my opinion, Lazenby turned out to be disappointing as Bond in the one film he was in, and sadly, after that, Connery didn't have a very good film to finish with. So, I didn't care much for those two films, but Live and Let Die, introducing Roger Moore (who would continue in the role for quite a while afterwards), showed some improvement.Three British agents are killed within 24 hours of each other, all in different places, but all while investigating the actions of Dr. Kananga, the mysterious dictator of the Caribbean island of San Monique! One is killed in New York, another in New Orleans, and the third in San Monique! James Bond is informed of these mysterious killings and sent to New York City to investigate. His mission takes him to an American crime boss named Mr. Big, who seems to be linked with the dictator of San Monique! After Agent 007 is caught by Mr. Big but manages to escape, he finds himself in various places on the west side of the Atlantic during his mission to try and foil Kananga's evil plan, which involves self-produced heroin, and often finds that Kananga and henchmen of his are after him! This eighth official James Bond movie is quite long, perhaps a bit TOO long, but at least it's not as tedious as On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Diamonds Are Forever. I'm not sure how to describe any other problems with the film. Sure, it has some rather silly moments, but that can obviously be expected. Despite shortcomings, Moore's first Bond film has a number of memorably thrilling sequences, especially later on in the film, with the likes of the double-decker bus chase, Bond with a bunch of hungry crocodiles, the boat chase, etc. There's also some humour in the film, such as Bond in a plane with a pilot in training as his foes chase him. I also found Sheriff J.W. Pepper a humorous character, with lines like What are you? Some kinda doomsday machine boy? Yes, I know he is a very stereotypical American Southerner, but the last movie I watched before this was The Adventures of Bob & Doug McKenzie Strange Brew, a comedy in which the main characters are two stereotypical Canadian dimwits, and I got a lot of laughs from them. As a Canuck, if I'm willing to laugh at fictional stereotypical idiots from my country, then I don't see why I should feel guilty for laughing at other stereotypes that are used for comic effect.At approximately two hours, this adaptation of Ian Fleming's novel (which, like the rest of them, I haven't read) isn't exactly super long, and I've been blown away by longer films (ones approximately three hours long), but still, it seems like it could have been at least just a tad shorter, and may seem a bit longer than it is. Nonetheless, it is a reasonable romp for the most part, and while it must have been difficult replacing Connery in the famous role, Roger Moore managed to pull it off, even if he's not QUITE as good in the role. The movie's theme song by Wings (which I've been familiar with for many years), is another highlight, as it is one of the memorable Bond themes. While inferior to some of its predecessors starring Connery, Live and Let Die could definitely give viewers some good thrills, if that's what they're looking for.

I remember that the first time I saw this movie I was taping it and eventually that VHS became one of my favourites but it's been a long time since I haven't watch this movie and also I stop watching regularly the show after Season 6 (released in my country in 2003 I think) and since then I have just bought the Greatest Hits Vol.1 DVD and I have seen just some episodes on MTV but not long time ago I knew about the fact that now all the episodes are available on the official website for free! So recently I saw a couple of the new episodes and I found them hilarious so I have been listening, for the very first time, some of the mini commentaries of Trey and Matt from the DVDs, in short re-discovering South Park. Now it was time to finally watch again SP Bigger, Longer & Uncut after so many years and right now I'm glad I have just did it but I'm more than glad that it is still that film that I loved!!!It begins in the classic way of making references to Cinema itself, not only with the boys (Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny) going to watch the first feature film of their favourite TV show (Terrance & Phillip), which is R-Rated, but also and quickly putting Cinema as where we learn everything that we know so what does the boys will learn by watching, lots of times, the 180 minutes Canadian masterwork of comedy 'Asses of Fire'? Well everything that was previously censored!It is a clever film and until now they have made similar things, for example in that episode with Family Guy, and in this case we are watching in the film a not surreal reaction of the parents if we think in the reaction of the parents if their kids starts talking like Cartman but it is the South Park movie and they make more bizarre stuff than those pair of Canadians. And later it plays as a great satire of war but they just don't care that and that's why it gets better.As for the boys, basically the four are together (yet Kenny in hell) fighting for the same cause but of course not for the same reasons (Stan must find the clitoris also!) but that doesn't really matters since these kids are clever enough to know that they are living a f*cked up situation. As for secondary characters, there aren't many difficulties in order to remember a memorable moment for most of the regulars support characters of the show and since South Park is the place where problem with T & P and the apocalypse began and since it's a quiet town everybody has a part.

Michael Caine is Alfie, a working-class Londoner who weaves his way in and out of episodes with various birds, referred to using the neutral it, as in it's all in love and ghosty now, and the consequences grow more dramatic.Alfie waltzes through all these sequential affairs with aplomb. Nothing bothers him. He's on the hedonic treadmill. He interrupts the goings on from time to time in order to deliver a wisecrack to the camera or sometimes a soliloquy with philosophical content such as a man and a woman talking' about things is intimate. You know what? Sometimes I think it's more intimate than the other. Those consequences, though, rather accumulate and begin to distress him. Not for very long. He's incapable of being genuinely depressed, taking advantage, as he does, of Kierkegaard's unfolding moment. What I mean is -- the guy is pretty shallow.His first problem comes when one of his girl friends gets pregnant. Quite an inconvenience when she insists on having the baby. She names the boy Malcolm Alfred and Alfie manages to stick around, without marrying her, for two years or so.

However, Sheen was very good.There was too much sex and nudity and this ruined the movie. That kind of stuff is better off in a playboy magazine. I think any movie that uses sex and nudity is not a classic, because it relies on this to get people interested. Romantic movies could have good intimate scenes, but the directors NEVER manage to show true love between two actors. Most actors don't know what love is, so when they are told to do scenes of this nature, they always act bordering on pride, which is not love. the only film that ever did show real intimacy and beauty was Titanic i think. 9 songs was a disgusting joke.

Thompson's offbeat cult novel gets rid of the pain of being a man. Words spoken from experience, perhaps, but what to make of this? Well- judged ideology? Homespun philosophy? Complete and utter boll**ks? Call it what you want.

Canted camera angles, out of sync dialogue, dreamlike imagery, senseless plot development, fast-cutting and slow-moing to the max'- the film, like the novel, is outrageously droll and wildly entertaining in its take on jangled reality and western capitalism.The acidic verve and eccentricity kicking in from the off a monochrome montage of anti-Vietnam war protests followed by an abrupt wipe cut of a red convertible hurtling along a desert highway to the sound of Big Brother and the Holding Company's Combination of the Two.

Sin city, though, is no place for psychedelic drugs and what started out as a business trip put up by headquarters, descends into in a perilous frenzy and delegation to shed light on the dark side of the acid culture and the crumbling American dream. Fear and Loathing is a jittery, unpredictable film that shifts between sublimely executed set-plays and bizarre imagery. Like Thompson's original tale, the film portrays the seventies as the failure of the sixties and achieves a balance between the two main adjectives all directors and authors care about unique and brilliant. Here, Gilliam has a freehold on both of them.

Depp, who spent considerable time with Thompson in preparation for the role, succeeds in bringing the raw charisma, peculiarities and estranged physical and vocal gestures of the renegade writer to life.Del Toro's performance as the odd Samoan counteracts that of Depp's well. The chemistry between the two makes for some compulsive, Withnail and I-esque viewing. Where Thompson gets lyrical in his trips, the Samoan gets paranoid and violent.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"1 August 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The British film critic Barry Norman once described Steven Spielberg as the man who makes B-movies on an A-movie budget. That sounds like a devastating put-down, but I don't think Norman meant it as such. What he meant was that Spielberg borrowed themes from the cheap and cheerful science-fiction and adventure stories he had known in his youth and then gave those themes the full, glossy A-movie treatment. Jaws is a case in point. If a film on this subject had been made twenty (or even ten) years earlier it would probably have had some lurid title such as The Giant Killer Shark Horror and have been made on a very low budget with comically bad special effects. It would doubtless have disappeared from view almost completely, only surfacing for occasional late-night showings on specialist movie channels, probably on a double bill with something like The Blood Beast Terror or Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. (I am not making that last one up; there really was a film with that title). Jaws is set on the island of Amity, somewhere off the north-east coast of the USA. (The film was actually shot on Martha's Vineyard). The film is a mixture of disaster movie and hunting epic. It is something of a convention in disaster films that the disaster should be either caused or exacerbated by human stupidity, negligence or greed, and Jaws is no exception. After a young woman is killed by a shark while out swimming, the local police chief Martin Brody wants to close the beaches, but allows himself to be overruled by the town's mayor and councillors who argue that the girl's death could in fact have been the result of her being struck by a propeller. They are motivated by the fact that the island is a popular holiday resort, dependent upon the income it receives from tourists, and any hint of a man-eating shark in the area would be economically disastrous. (There was a very similar plot line in the 1990s disaster film, Dante's Peak, although that concerned a volcano rather than a shark). Of course, Brody is proved right and the shark strikes again, causing panic on the beach and killing a young boy. Soon afterwards a shark is caught, and the relieved local politicians announce that this is the one that was responsible for the two deaths. One man, however, is not convinced. Matt Hooper, an ichthyologist, believes from the wounds on the two bodies that the shark that has been caught was too small to have carried out the attacks. Hooper and Brody, who is suffering from feelings of guilt over the boy's death, charter a boat, skippered by a local fisherman named Quint, to hunt down the true culprit. Although the film was made more than thirty years ago, it has dated well, despite the many advances in cinema technology that have occurred since then. Today the shark would probably be conjured up by CGI, but in 1975 Spielberg had to rely upon a mechanical model. As this model frequently malfunctioned, we do not, in fact, see the shark all that often, although this probably adds to the film's effectiveness by making the scenes in which it does appear all the more frightening. Also very effective is John Williams's simple but eerie theme tune; like Bernard Herrman's score for Psycho this demonstrates that the most effective film music is not always that which would sound best in the concert hall. Roy Scheider as Brody and Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper play their parts well, but I have never really liked Robert Shaw's eccentric Quint. Although Quint does not actually have a wooden leg, a gold earring or a parrot squawking Pieces of Eight, Shaw seems to have fallen victim to the curse of overacting which frequently afflicts film stars called upon to portray members of the seafaring profession. (He was much better in A Man for All Seasons and The Sting). The film has other weaknesses; at times it appears improbable (could a shark really batter its way into an iron cage so easily?) and at others, particularly in the first half, overlong. Overall, however, Jaws is a reasonably good film, and in the second half, when the great shark hunt is under way, manages to be both thrilling and, at times, genuinely frightening. Nevertheless, I certainly would not agree with all those who have voted it into your top 100 films (it is currently at #97). It was only Spielberg's second feature film, and his first major success, and I suspect that its continuing popularity owes as much to its place in the Spielberg canon as it does to its intrinsic merits. I have never been an adherent of the quasi-religious Cult of the Great Director which has grown up around Spielberg; he has made some excellent films, notably the brilliant Schindler's List, but these have normally been when he has tried to produce something of greater significance than the popcorn blockbusters which have constituted much of his output. Jaws is a well-made and exciting adventure film, but at the end of the day it is still only a B-movie made on an A-movie budget. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 August 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The British film critic Barry Norman once described Steven Spielberg as the man who makes B-movies on an A-movie budget.

If a film on this subject had been made twenty (or even ten) years earlier it would probably have had some lurid title such as The Giant Killer Shark Horror and have been made on a very low budget with comically bad special effects. It would doubtless have disappeared from view almost completely, only surfacing for occasional late-night showings on specialist movie channels, probably on a double bill with something like The Blood Beast Terror or Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. (I am not making that last one up; there really was a film with that title). Jaws is set on the island of Amity, somewhere off the north-east coast of the USA. (The film was actually shot on Martha's Vineyard). The film is a mixture of disaster movie and hunting epic. It is something of a convention in disaster films that the disaster should be either caused or exacerbated by human stupidity, negligence or greed, and Jaws is no exception. After a young woman is killed by a shark while out swimming, the local police chief Martin Brody wants to close the beaches, but allows himself to be overruled by the town's mayor and councillors who argue that the girl's death could in fact have been the result of her being struck by a propeller. They are motivated by the fact that the island is a popular holiday resort, dependent upon the income it receives from tourists, and any hint of a man-eating shark in the area would be economically disastrous. (There was a very similar plot line in the 1990s disaster film, Dante's Peak, although that concerned a volcano rather than a shark). Of course, Brody is proved right and the shark strikes again, causing panic on the beach and killing a young boy. Soon afterwards a shark is caught, and the relieved local politicians announce that this is the one that was responsible for the two deaths. One man, however, is not convinced. Matt Hooper, an ichthyologist, believes from the wounds on the two bodies that the shark that has been caught was too small to have carried out the attacks. Hooper and Brody, who is suffering from feelings of guilt over the boy's death, charter a boat, skippered by a local fisherman named Quint, to hunt down the true culprit. Although the film was made more than thirty years ago, it has dated well, despite the many advances in cinema technology that have occurred since then. Today the shark would probably be conjured up by CGI, but in 1975 Spielberg had to rely upon a mechanical model. As this model frequently malfunctioned, we do not, in fact, see the shark all that often, although this probably adds to the film's effectiveness by making the scenes in which it does appear all the more frightening. Also very effective is John Williams's simple but eerie theme tune; like Bernard Herrman's score for Psycho this demonstrates that the most effective film music is not always that which would sound best in the concert hall. Roy Scheider as Brody and Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper play their parts well, but I have never really liked Robert Shaw's eccentric Quint. Although Quint does not actually have a wooden leg, a gold earring or a parrot squawking Pieces of Eight, Shaw seems to have fallen victim to the curse of overacting which frequently afflicts film stars called upon to portray members of the seafaring profession. (He was much better in A Man for All Seasons and The Sting). The film has other weaknesses; at times it appears improbable (could a shark really batter its way into an iron cage so easily?) and at others, particularly in the first half, overlong.

Nevertheless, I certainly would not agree with all those who have voted it into your top 100 films (it is currently at #97). It was only Spielberg's second feature film, and his first major success, and I suspect that its continuing popularity owes as much to its place in the Spielberg canon as it does to its intrinsic merits. I have never been an adherent of the quasi-religious Cult of the Great Director which has grown up around Spielberg; he has made some excellent films, notably the brilliant Schindler's List, but these have normally been when he has tried to produce something of greater significance than the popcorn blockbusters which have constituted much of his output.

If I gave the rating based on simply by how I felt and how much I was entertained by the film, I'd give it an 8. I really liked the characters and the conflicts between them, as well as many surprising notes on where Jewish people are mistreated. Unfortunately, the film has quite a lot of faults in it.I should mention that in Finland, you can't find too many Jews. At least I can't say I personally know anyone. Also, I haven't read the novel. Plus English is not my native language. These things in mind, I try to give as perfect a review as I can.First off, my favorite character in the film was the Jewish scientist and I wanted to see more of him. Unfortunately, he's in a one scene only.Luckily, there are more great characters. The main character, Phil Green, for instance. He's high values and a little naive straightforwardness make him a respectful person. His son, Tom, seems similar to his father, but without all the knowledge. Phil's mother's the same breed, but quite a bit more subtle. So what's nice here is that the Greens almost fit the same mold, but still have enough characteristics of their own.There's, of course, Phil's co-workers. His boss seems a little like a father to Phil, having the same ideals and all. Anne is the same. She's the cheeriest person around, but she's not a dizzy blond. Phil secretary is Jewish, but due to her experiences considers herself to be of lower breed than the catholic Christians. Very different from Phil's all-time friend Dave, whose Jewish also.Then, there's Kathy. She's Phil's love interest. Their chemistry works right away and all seems well with them. However, soon we realize what and unlikable person she is. My mother, with whom I was watching the film, said that she'd began loathing her. What's interesting, after the movie she said she'd probably be just like her. When she said the first comment, I realized that Kathy was what you could call a normal person. She's the one that most of the people should relate to, but she gets the opposite response. She's the mirror placed in front of the viewers.Having said that much about the characters, it's time for the acting. It was bad. First I figured it was because of the script that stated out everything they thought, which was quite unnatural. This could've been what made it difficult for the actors to breath life into the lines. Soon I noticed that the actors couldn't even get it right with the lines that had no problem in them.

When delivering their lines they take these strange pauses. The dialogue goes this I'm saying this now. This sentence ends now. I'm changing a subject. Now I'm saying a new sentence. I don't know whether it's the actors' or the director's fault, but for some reason the acting is rarely natural.The visuals are basic stuff, not bad, but nothing special. The writing varies from bad to good. Sometimes the characters say too much of what they're thinking which isn't natural, as I stated before. This is a problem with a lot of films made in the US.

After the 5th time it got very very annoying. The score was decent except for the single piano playing during suspenseful moments. A single piano note playing over and over again. Also very annoying.The plot of the film had great aspirations but after the midway point I thought the suspense was built up in perfect Kubrick style but there was never any conclusion. Also Tom Cruises character had the most random thing happen to him that it seemed unrealistic and more or less unrelated to the plot of the movie. Some of the scenes I felt went on for way too long like Nichole Kidmans crying scene when her husband came back form the party.I have tried very hard to like this movie and was among the excited fans waiting to see this movie when it first came out.

He's on a mission to confront Anne Bancroft who's given him a 'let's call it a day' letter. Anne works as a singer in a posh New York nightclub attached to one of the fancier hotels. After a nasty scene with Bancroft, Widmark's left with an itch to scratch.The answer might be Marilyn Monroe across the courtyard looking real provocative and arousing Widmark's interest. He gives her a call and things might be going good. Then the little girl, Donna Corcoran, wakes up from the next room and Marilyn starts to act very weird indeed.This one was one of Marilyn's first roles which exploited a little more than her beauty. She plays a troubled young lady who's just spent some time in a mental institution. Her uncle Elisha Cook, Jr., got her that job as a babysitter for Corcoran whose parents Jim Backus and Jeanne Cagney are at a banquet in the hotel. Truth be told the role was no stretch for Marilyn given her own sad history.Widmark's not a particularly noble character here, but he's a decent enough man. He's just like millions of other men who when they lose their love, cure it with trying to love what's available. Anne Bancroft makes a nice screen debut here although I can't believe she sung those songs herself. If so, why didn't she do any more singing on screen?Though the film gets melodramatic and the characters don't give you any real rooting interest, Don't Bother To Knock remains a landmark film for the careers of both Marilyn Monroe and Anne Bancroft.

This is unmistakably and indelibly a Sergio Leone vision. One could imagine that Clint Eastwood was first offered the role of Harmonica, the avenger, and then it went to Charles Bronson. Perhaps he wasn't, as Bronson was superb as the Everyman hero\/possible avenging angel character; he projected a subtle sorrow in his piercing eyes, even his body language, that made him perfect for the role.The plot is multilayered, revolving around a lovely widow (Claudia Cardinale) of a shrewd man named Brett McBain, who is brutally murdered along with his family by the railroad's hired guns while she is enroute to join them at their home in Sweetwater. Her property is what is coveted and it becomes Harmonica's bait to settle an old score with the railroad's chief hired gun, Frank, who is shockingly revealed to be played by wholesome Henry Fonda. His clear blue eyes, so apparently innocent-looking, become frightening in their lack of human emotions. Frank kills without remorse whatever it befalls him to kill as casually as flicking a leaf off his sleeve. Human life is meaningless to him, even more so than to his tubercular cancer-ridden boss Morton. At least he has a motive (greed) to explain his hubris; Frank evidently needs no such excuse and kills because it's what he was born to do.Another character is brought into the tense mix, a bountied outlaw named Cheyenne, appealingly played by Jason Robards. He is also a killer, but one with a sense of humor and a kind streak, as well as a soft spot in his heart for pretty women. He and Harmonica form a strange alliance against Frank and the railroad, which Cheyenne sees as a threat to his way of outlaw life. At the same time, he becomes friendly with the widow Jill, who in turn is oddly drawn to Harmonica. When Cheyenne realizes this, he utters his famous line There's something inside a man like that... something about death. It is discovered that McBain bought a substantial amount of property and had planned to build a railroad station. He had everything legally in place to build the station but if it isn't finished by the time the railroad reaches Sweetwater, his heir forfeits the right to build it and even to keep the land. Harmonica uncovers the motive for McBain's murder and finds the means to prevent McBain's dream from failing by making Cheyenne's gang build it.Frank, who is usually so icily carefree about death and those who stalk him, grows more obsessed with finding out who Harmonica is, since every time he asks him, the enigmatic drifter keeps answering by naming off men that Frank has killed. Everything comes apart for Morton and Frank as the killer begins to slowly but relentlessly unravel, with vague flashbacks rising as to who Harmonica might be. They, however, keep his past shrouded sufficiently so that Frank cannot quite close this maddening chapter in his life by just gunning down Harmonica and being done with him.At last, Frank is mortally wounded in the climatic gun duel by Harmonica, who mysteriously is less fazed by what should also be a mortal wound, leading to the speculation that Harmonica is more than he appears to be. Placing his harmonica to Frank's dying lips where his weakening breath wheezes out a few ragged discordant notes, Harmonica watches as recognition dawns and his past is finally realized by Frank. He had sadistically stood a man upon his younger brother's shoulders with a noose around his victim's neck, then shoved a harmonica into the boy's lips. Easing back to watch for the moment when the younger man's legs would finally give out and his brother would hang, Frank is smiling with cold pleasure at his handiwork. It is at that point that the older brother cursed his killer and kicked the boy out from under him, thus alleviating the responsibility placed on Harmonica to keep him alive.But this sequence, though gratifying from a vengeance point, does not answer the question about Harmonica's mysterious knowledge about Frank's victims or his apparent ability to shake off a serious wound with little effect. That combined with Harmonica's penchant to be in the right place at the right time, to stand outside of events while at times controlling them, gives his character a dimension that disconnects him from temporal events. He becomes at those moments like a mysterious angel of death.Every actor was wonderful in his role, from Claudia Cardinale to Jason Robards, but the two principals were outstanding. Fonda, renowned for playing good guys, turned his reputation as an actor completely around with his flawless portrayal of the vicious and heartless killer, Frank. His foil, played to understated perfection by Charles Bronson, was the reluctant vigilante, the man consumed with revenge for his brother's murder, and yet not merely that. Bronson projected from Harmonica a deep and inexplicable sadness that permeated his words, appearance and actions.This was not Leone's choice for a movie. He had abandoned the spaghetti Western concept after the Clint Eastwood films, but was persuaded to take on this project. It did not fare well at the box office, which is no surprise considering its length of almost three hours. A great pity, as it is often overlooked by fans of the spaghetti Western genre for both its lack of commercial success, and for committing the unforgivable sin of not having Eastwood in the lead. It is a great film and works on many levels; in some ways, it is the distillation and the perfection of the SW genre even as it closed it out for good.
