And that's how this film begins and upon that we are going to watch the gory situations that the Rat-Monkey will bring to the people of Wellington. Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Balme) is a young man from a very rich family. Paquita (Diana Peñalver) is a young woman who works at a local shop and whose entire family believes in what the cards may say. This two will start a relationship but for their misfortune Lionel's mother (Elizabeth Moody) is an old racist woman will try to avoid that Lionel spend time with Paquita. This part of the film is just the introduction to the characters that will be part of the problems that the Rat-Monkey will bring and certainly is when this unique, bizarre and amazing creature finally appears ( yes the Rat-Monkey looks very cool) when this film really begins and upon that, the fun, the gore, the creativity and the zombies will never abandon the screen. The character of Lionel is just great (a great performance of the unknown Balme) and the fact that his mother is the first infected will just confirms the excellent son that Lionel is and the love between a mother and a son. So we are going to see how Lionel will take care of his mother after she begin to turns into a living dead and is so funny how in order to protect his mother, Lionel hides her and tries to continue with his regular life but of course he can't control a zombie so eventually there are going to be more and more infected persons. Is hilarious to see Lionel hiding every zombie and all together looking as a true family, yes a rare family. The film is full of gore and there is a gory moment everywhere, with really cool visuals with a lot of creativity, just like hilarious moments but of course there are the moments and also the zombies that are more memorable than the rest. To list and remember some, there is a really cool father who has another interest apart of being a pederast. Yes the father is also a really good fighter and his fighting scene is nothing but memorable. Later as a zombie, he becomes a dad and his baby is probably the most memorable zombie of the film. The final party is the greatest sequence of the film, of course, and definitely a very gory reunion so in order to end with the zombies, including his mother, Lionel and Paquita must cover their entire bodies with some blood, well actually with tons of blood. Conclusion What a gory, funny and memorable zombie picture with wonderful special effects. When you see for the very first time the Sumatran Rat-Money is just really cool but actually you will almost forget that great scene, of course after a really bloody final massacre. Anyway, I still don't think that all the fans of Peter Jackson's Rings will enjoy this film as I did (for example my sister) but definitely all the people who claim that are true Cinema lovers and believe that Rings will be the only films for what Jackson will be remember, well you better check this cult gem first. DVD The only extra is the theatrical trailer but to have this film in my collection is the cool thing. I recommend you that if you want to see for the first time Dead-Alive (the USA title) you get this DVD with the uncut version because is a film to see more than once. PS If you have the DVD of Jackson's Kong you better check the scene when the cage of the Sumatran Rat-Monkey is in the ship. Appears when the pianist (Brody) is at the animal storage hold inside the ship.

The word 'masterpiece' might incite criticism from other reviewers, but I think this film deserves it. Road to Perdition pivots on its truly spectacular cinematography (which, in my opinion, is the best of any film) and its beautiful score by Thomas Newman; although the acting and script are also fantastic. The director Sam Mendes, cinematographer Conrad L. Hall and composer Thomas Newman reunited for this picture after 1999's American Beauty, and the result is a film which works in many respects. You may have heard of Road to Perdition as a gangster film. Yes, the main characters are 1930s Chicago-linked gangsters. But this film is far deeper than any mob film i have seen, and certainly the only gangster film in which i have cried throughout the final 20 minutes. It is about the love of paternal relationships (between Mike Sullivan Snr. & Jnr, between Sullivan Snr and the man who fills the role of his father, John Rooney, and also between Rooney and his son Connor), but also the futility of violence and mob power, and how it can lead to the betrayal by and of those we love most, and the loss of childhood innocence. Although the film avoids dragging on 1hr45mins long, Mendes leaves us with an overwhelming sense of completion. The film has said what it set out to say, and delivered its messages exquisitely. This is also due to elements of Conrad L. Hall's cinematography (e.g. the ring composition of the shots of Michael Sullivan Jnr. on the beach in Perdition facing the sea and the pure sounds of the waves both of which begin and end the film). Mendes and Hall's signature cinematography of the reflection of rainwater is employed to great effect, symbolising the upcoming event of a death, as is the contrast of dark blood against light walls, which in turn contrasts with the general grey hue of the sets and costumes throughout. (The sets and costumes are accurate and effective.) The changing relationship between Sullivan Snr and Jnr is underlined by cinematography (e.g. in the first half, the son's view of his father is shot distantly, whereas there are more close-ups in the second half, and when the two are sitting in the car in the garage, their faces are separated by the frame of the car), and the rain scene is an iconic cinematographic triumph, my favourite elements of which are Hanks entering and leaving like a ghost, emerging from and disappearing into the rain, and the omission of sound effects until Newman speaks, lending greater impetus to heart-rending music of Thomas Newman. The fact that the masterful cinematography and script enhance the acting doesn't detract from the sheer talent of the cast. Hanks gives a top-notch performance, as usual, as Michael Sullivan Snr, a handyman for Irish-American mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman). Sullivan is betrayed and forced to go on the run with his son Michael Sullivan Jnr after his son witnesses a murder. Hanks skilfully draws in the viewer to empathise with his guilt, grief and determination, and Newman shines as the mob boss faced with a terrible choice. Daniel Craig delivers, making us love to hate him as the spoilt, corrupt son of John Rooney, and Jude Law gives an unforgettable turn as the twisted crime scene photographer - slash - hit-man sent after the Sullivans. Law is extremely unsettling to watch, with his revolting hair, creepily long fingernails and rodent-like countenance. Tyler Hoechlin, as Michael Sullivan Jnr, exhibits remarkable talent. We as viewers can deduce his confusion, despair and love from his face alone, and he steers way clear of being included in my list of infuriating child actors. Al Capone's famous right-hand man Frank Nitti is authoritatively played by Stanley Tucci, whilst Capone himself is left ominously off-screen (his scene was shot, but omitted from the final cut, and can be seen on the DVD deleted scenes). Hanks is not a glamorous hero, he is ruthless and a multiple murderer, but hates the lifestyle from which he cannot escape as his and his family's welfare, as well as his relationship with Paul Newman, depend on it. This makes him all the more appealing as the film's protagonist. Unbeatable with respect to cinematography; a tall order in other respects. Fantastic.
