Unfortunately Kim Hunter probably heard about it & got sick to her stomach.What in the name of God??????? All the Ape faces brings to mind Halloween masks with the backs out. Shoulda recycle Nightmare before Christmas & Corpse Bride puppets or told it in CGI\/animation. & again the low-lighted sets? Memo 2 all involved in film financing & distribution movie keep his man away from remakes of any type especially musicals &, except for Mars Attacks, this genre. & and talk of too many humans. The original two Apes films kept the human numbers to less than 20 to my recollection.I thought I'd never say this--The role of Captain Leo Davidson SHOULD HAVE WENT TO JOHNNY DEPP! He's got more versatility; will at least try to stretch his acting (Although for my taste he's being more and more horribly miscast in Timmy films). He was excellent in Astronaunt's Wife--Pretty Boy Wooden on Kazoo Wahlberg? Oh please! Or how about this casting Michael Keaton if not Depp??? Timmy B don't know how to cast a male lead to save his life! In terms of female leads he does better with HB-C but her in this???? IMO she should have been skipped over for casting in this flick at any & all levels. Elegant &\/or down the down to every woman, whatever the character type or past & present, is her forte. As much as I hate her squat screen time role in Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, it wasn't a SCI-FI Film! Get Veronica Cartwright, Robin Curtis, Terry Ferrell any experienced sci-fi actress who could rise above the level of unbelievable.The reasons I believe Timmy B had Chalty Heston doing his little bit here are 2 fold 1) thought it would wow fans of the 1st movie ergo they'll come in droves trying to find what scene he's in; & 2) promised he'd pad Heston's bankroll. In case of reason #1, next time he wants to draw in fans of a media icon to a cinema adaptions, especially in the area of sci-fi, talk to Michael Bay regarding his casting of a main robot character 2007 movie adaption, for crying out loud!Oh wait a sec, just remembered--The Astronaunt's Wife wasn't directed by Timmy.
