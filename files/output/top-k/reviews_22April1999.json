Remnants of the human population battle a desperate war against SkyNet's army of sophisticated war machines, under the leadership of John Connor.

John Connor is able to send a protector for his mother, Kyle Reese, but can he stop the evil cyborg before it's too late?Although The Terminator is not as much action-packed as T2 or Aliens, and the action sequences are not the best I have seen, it doesn't damages the movie at all. On the contrary time is devoted to character and story development and I quickly realized that its primary purpose is not just to entertain, but also to warn to warn against the power that we possess and how it can be misused to destroy its creator humans. Attention to detail, that would become the director's signature, is amazing. And also there is romance; although I admit one sexual scene lasting for one and a half minute does not make a romantic film, it was never intended for that purpose. Rather, it serves as an enrichment of already brilliant story and characters. Acting is superb, I think this is Shwarzenegger's most convincing performance.

Studio executives were very protective of image and star-making. In essence, everything seemed perfect. Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, and D.M. Marshman, Jr. created a stunning work of art that splits the Hollywood sign in two and exposed a dream factory for what it really is a struggle to both gain and keep notoriety in the limelight. Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis are at opposite ends of this warped Hollywood mindset, with Gillis, played by that most cynical of actors, William Holden trying to pay the rent and Norma (Gloria Swanson) living a lie as a silent queen whose star burned 10,000 midnights ago. How a picture with such a snide look at the industry could come out in 1950 is simply mind-boggling, considering some of the light fodder that came out of Hollywood at the time. It has inspired many modern day disciples such as Altman's THE PLAYER, and Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY, both of which took their vicious, hilarious parodies to the jugular of the movie capital of the world.

In fact, I am pleased that Cameron decided to put the romance between Rose and Jack in the forefront. Yes, it is unlikely that a romance would develop between a homeless boy and an ultra-rich girl in 1912, but that makes the story very exciting and challenges our imagination. Acting is excellent, I think, as it is in all Cameron's movies. DiCaprio may not look like Schwarzenegger, but his boyish looks make him kinda fragile and thus more emotional. Kate Winslet was a perfect pick by Cameron; her acting was incredible. Music, albeit repetitive, was magnificent and it is not surprising that the soundtrack was so successful. But what is most remarkable about Titanic is its emotional impact; you know that the ship will sink, but characters don't know it before Titanic hits the iceberg. You watch them enjoy life, love each other. This is already very emotional because you know there would a quick end to all of that.From the negative reviews that I've read so far I have a feeling that people who wrote them are disappointed because they had expected something different. If you want to see a documentary-type film, don't watch Titanic. You will be gravely disappointed. This is not a film for you. But if you want to enter the beautiful and imaginative world that Cameron has created, then watch Titanic. And you will understand why this film won 11 Oscars.What to say for the conclusion.

Horrible acting and horrible plot earns this movie a nice 1\/10.  I hate to disappoint those who like this movie, but obviously you have not watched the original Halloween and have been fooled into believing that Michael Myers is some cult devil worshiper who really has enough intelligence to think about what he's doing.  He's mental!  He's scary!  He's a psycho! He's a killer!  He's Michael Myers damn it!  I have to admit that H20 revives Myers from the pansy the sequels made him into.

Pretty soon I was hooked. Although I found the fight scenes a little too graphic for my liking, generally the special effects were not so overwhelming as to be mind numbing (as they are so often in movies of this genre).  For me the real appeal was watching Kurt convey his suffering at his alienation from humanity, as well as his slow awareness of how much had been stolen from him by his barbaric upbringing.  I also felt his revenge\/defence of the settlers at the end of the movie was fitting and justified.  The director resisted the urge to have him do a complete turnaround and overcome the many years of conditioning. He still was unable to connect with other adults, but you could tell by his relationship with Nathan (the little boy) that the potential was there waiting to be developed.  All in all I liked the movie and will recommend it to others..

I still question Criterion's poor lack of judgment in releasing the DVD at all, though, since there are so many quality movies that would more greatly benefit from a Special Edition Criterion treatment. As usual, though, the Criterion DVD is technically over-rated. The sound on the entire Extras DVD is extremely poor, and is just very hard to listen to at all.More interesting, though, is that on a second viewing it becomes kind of obvious what a Republican manifesto the whole movie is. Michael Bay's gag reel on the Extras DVD largely consists of Billy Bob Thornton's stereotypical and offensive gay impressions. Greenpeace is portrayed unsympathetically early on in the movie protesting the oil drilling (is that even a real cause of theirs? Save the oil?). Bruce Willis, the hero, shoots his gun all over the oil well, like a crazed NRA member. Maybe I am way off-base, but some of these images (especially Billy Bob's meanness) made me upset. This definitely is not a liberal movie.  ","genre":null},{"date":"22 April 1999","score":"","review":"  The Criterion Armageddon DVD is very good, some decent extras.

The acting is excellent. The direction is interesting... I could write a book, but what I kept thinking was how much the audience worships not just the violence, but the power. How much they love the fascist criminal, the mob boss who must be obeyed and shown loyalty to.Uma Thurman is just decadently sexy. John Travolta is amazingly lovable as a low-rent hood and Bruce Willis is believable as a prize fighter who turns the tables and wins the fight instead of throwing it (and, in an up-to-date spin, bets on himself-seems right! How come they never did that before they probably did, I just missed it.). Samuel Jackson is interesting as the Bible-quoting black hit man.Naturally they make us root for the bad guys; indeed the bad guys are almost always the heroes in the modern Hollywood. We can really explore ourselves only as bad guys. The pro-mo's for cigarettes, heroin, cocaine, booze and decadence are getting a little thin, however. A Hollywood movie, a commercial flick, is always a cliché. The art part comes from doing spins on the cliché, in putting a new twist on the old bull****, on the old standards. Ironically interesting was the sensuous indulgence of dinner for Travolta and Thurman. He's shot heroin, she's done a few lines, they smoke some pot, they smoke some cigarettes, but they really get off on milk shakes and vanilla cokes, steaks and hamburgers. Poor Hollywood. They've done it all and now must find real indulgence in fat, salt, sugar and meat, which for the stars really is an indulgence. If your life span is only sixteen to about thirty-five, then the forbidden things really are fat, salt, meat and anything else that puts on the weight. Cocaine and cigarettes can't hurt you because by the time the ill effects kick in, your career is over anyway.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Non-whites, to the Neo-Nazi, aren't deserving of time and patience (or politeness).American History X really struck a chord, a very painful chord, in the way that it explained the behavior and beliefs of the average Neo-Nazi.

It didn't display all Neo-Nazi's as ignorant and it didn't display all African-American's as violent, drug-abusing gang-bangers. This movie brilliantly captured reality. The cinematography wasn't perfect, neither was the plot. But that doesn't matter. What matters is that it made its point effectively. The point wasn't that racism is there and that racists are bad.
