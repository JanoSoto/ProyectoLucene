She is aided in her adventures by a comical dragon named Mushu, a lucky (or is it unlucky?) cricket, and three wise-cracking compatriots at arms.The Disney formula works remarkably well here (though the love story angle is a bit of a stretch).  Mulan is a likable and gutsy representation of grrrrrl power in a predominately male society. Her outspoken nature and penchant to think and take action when necessary are in direct contrast to the normal feminine roles in the ancient world. Voluminous supporting players require more-than-average attention span by the viewer, but then this is an epic war story!  And each of these characters is given their moment to shine, while never fully taking the reins from the true heroine.The lessons of tolerance and empowerment for young girls are blatantly obvious, but they do not detract from what is a terrific and moving story.  As in any good Disney animated adventure, the music plays a big part, and some of the songs stick with you long after the end credits run. The animation is incredibly fluid and evocative of the oriental setting, and some of the special effects are a wonder to behold. The training sequences and mountain battle scenes are brilliant examples of the craft.The vocal cast is an international potpourri of talent, including Pat Morita, Harvey Fierstein (as a REAL man's man!  Go figure!), June Foray, George Takei, and Eddie Murphy (hilarious as fast-talking dragon, Mushu).  The dialog is rapid-fire and intelligent for adults, but easy enough for older children to grasp.  Donny Osmond's song for the training sequence (I'll Make a Man Out of You) is a thunderous and inspirational war ballad that still rings in my ears - particularly when I am working out or have a heavy job to accomplish.  Also, listen carefully to the music for the closing of the film No less talent than 98 Degrees, Stevie Wonder, and Christina Aguilera (before her genie ever came out of its bottle)!There are a few small flaws in logic (i.e., The rescue of Mulan and her horse during the avalanche - While Mulan may be a fierce and powerful warrior, I don't think even HER legs could hold up that horse!), and some of the humor may sail past younger viewers (cross-dressing gags, suggested nudity and jokes about the hygenic habits of men, to name a few...). Still, the multitude of characters, snappy dialog, and various levels of action and adventure make this film as much fun on the twentieth viewing as on the first.Mulan is highly entertaining kids and adults equally (My 3-year-old son requests this one regularly!).

DVD was, BTW, well-done and included several deleted scenes plus nine episodes of the fictional soap opera Reason to Love. But the DD 5.1 sound has very little in the LFE or the rear channels. Renee Zellweger plays a simple, trusting housewife with a lousy, thieving, cheating car salesman of a husband, Morgan Freeman is a professional about to retire, and is training his son, played by Chris Rock. Greg Kinnear plays the actor who is a doctor on the soap opera, and Crispin Glover plays a reporter in their small Kansas town. Betty, works as a waitress, is thoroughly enchanted by the TV soap, A Reason to Love, and thinks of the characters as real people.Husband has somehow come into possession of a trunkful of drugs, and the two professionals show up to get it back for their client. They are in his house, don't know Betty is in the next room watching her favorite TV show, things get out of hand, son scalps husband, who goes beserk, so the dad is forced to shoot and kill him.

She in this temporary insanity really believes he is a real person and that she was engaged to him 6 years ago, and she wants to find him and reconcile.

As often happens, an author with a great idea for a story doesn't quite know how to pull it all together and end it, and that is how I feel about this one. Still, it is good etertainment and I rate it 7 of 10, and could easily have been an 8 or 9 with a bit tighter scripting.Also, this movie contains something which has become a personal gripe of mine.  Chris Rock is a good actor, but his character is too much like his R-rated comedic persona. Sure, he is a bad guy, but after a while I become very tired of constant use of the F-word. In contrast, it was used sparingly and to enhance the story in Billy Elliot, but in Nurse Betty, which really is a dark comedy, I think it becomes a serious detraction for serious viewers.Also, the director and film editor felt srongly that the violence perpetrated by the two professionals had to be shown to properly set the mood of this film. I disagree. The casual way film-makers show shootings, scalpings, and the such just add another straw to the wagon of devaluation of life.  They could have done this in a much more tasteful manner.

Empire was and still is, so far, the best Star Wars installment to grace our big screens. The plot line was superb and really made for a hell of a ride for us to enjoy. The character development in this movie, from Han to Leia, Luke to Vader, Lando to Han, etc. was perfect. The special effects were taken to a all new level of intensity (the Hoth battle is still one of the best battle sequences ever--real or not). And John Williams' score is phenomenal.It is very rare for any movie to make this claim, but Empire is one of the few sequels that out shines its predecessor. I think one of the reasons I also like Empire so much is the fact that it gave the Star Wars universe a much more grittier and darker tone. Darth Vader really became one of cinemas greatest bad guys in this. And Boba Fett was quite the bad ass mercenary\/bounty hunter.Another reason I believe Empire is so much more popular and better than the rest of the trilogy is due to the fact it has a very emotional side to it. This gives the viewer a chance to become more closely involved with all the characters. I strongly recommend Empire for anyone that enjoys movies that make you cheer for the good guys, jeer for the bad guys (or cheer, I still love Vader!!) and gives you an overall great movie experience. Empire is definitely a classic of our time.

My grandmother gave me a copy of the book when I was eighteen. I had never heard of the masterpiece, but it is Lolita, the novel, which ignited my passion for brilliant prose and Lolita remains my favorite book.Why can't the book be filmed? Let's see. In the Kubrick version from 1962, Lolita is sixteen; in Lyne's (this) version, she is fourteen. In the novel, she is twelve. 1997 and Lolita is still two years older than she was in the novel. The real-life difference between twelve and fourteen is enormous. About the last thing I want to see is a twelve year-old girl and a middle aged man making out on screen. I don't suggest that a fourteen year-old girl and a middle aged man is acceptable. Nor sixteen and middle aged. The point is that this literary masterpiece simply needs to be read to be appreciated; if a faithful rendition of the novel is to be made, it would be kiddie porn. It would also have to be ten or twelve hours long. And really, the sickness of Humbert, his blighted lust and love for small girls, isn't even what the book is about. The book was written with venom, yet venom so rich and esoteric that it only makes us hate Humbert more than we already do, yet a measure of sympathy does emerge, and more so in the two films than the novel. Nabokov wrote the book, knew it was a gamble, knew it would be censored and above all, knew it would be talked about by EVERYBODY. He wrote the book in order to achieve financial independence and to say that he succeeded is a masterpiece of understatement. The anger I refer to is Nabokov's contempt for cruelty (yes, contempt) in any form. Dolores Haze is ruined by a depraved animal; America is roasted slowly over fire on a spit. And never has America been ravaged so exquisitely! Okay, I needed to mention all that. The actual film is wonderfully photographed and Frank Languella, as Quilty, deserved a Best Supporting Oscar. Jeremy Iron's narration is hypnotic and outstanding; Domonique Swain is quite good given the circumstances. Sue Lyon had far more censorship problems in 1962 than did Swain in 1997, and Swain is thoroughly believable. However, the pedophile aspect can never be overcome, neither can the richness of Nabokov's prose be transmitted visually to the screen with consistency--and THIS, even more than the kiddie angle, is the primary reason why a GREAT Lolita will never appear on a silver screen. I can think of two brief exceptions to this, no more. In my favorite scene, where Quilty uses word-play to terrorize Humbert, the zapping of the insect killer, the purple sparks, the tone of Quilty's voice, his expressions (sleep is a rose, the Persians say) are pure Nabokov, and this scene is superb. The other Lolita book-like part of the film, and a close second to the above scene, is Humbert's murder of Quilty. Quilty eats cigarettes, he spouts richly literate nonsense, a piano covered with blood keeps playing--it is also superb, this scene.But the rest of it, and honestly the film is about as good as one could make of the novel, is hit or miss. In the Kubrick version, Shelly Winters, of whom I tend to be no fan, is impeccable. Melanie Griffith, in this one, is flat-out AWFUL! I wanted her dispatched long before she had been. Of course she is supposed to be vapid, but shrieking literally half of her dialogue isn't necessary to achieve this end.Lyne did a good job and I would recommend this film.

If you hear too much about the plot, it will ruin the experience.Now, this movie is one of the most beautifully crafted films ever made, the way it is shoot, the music and especially the directing by Christopher Nolan. The performances of Guy Pearce (Leonard) and Joe Pantoliano (Teddy) are absolutely brilliant. Carrie-Ann Moss (Natalie) is also good, but not brilliant.

So go out there and see this film, you won't be disappointed I promise.

It's probably the smartest teen comedy in the last ten years.There are some people bashing this movie and I just can't have it.  If you don't enjoy this movie the first time, it's YOUR FAULT.  Watch it again. It works on many, many levels, and it gets funnier every time you watch it.A few clues to some of the idiots who have slammed this movie.  Matthew Broderick's character isn't SUPPOSED to be sympathetic.  It's called an everyman.  He's not plastic and heroic, he's HUMAN.  We identify with him because he reminds us of ourselves  we all have noble intentions, we all try hard, but we also screw up and we're hypocrites sometimes and sometimes our so-called noble intentions lead us to do rotten things, things we never dreamed we would stoop to.This movie doesn't let any of its characters off the hook.  No one is blameless, and no one is unredeemable.  It's human comedy.  If you like cookie-cutter characters and simplistic plotlines, go elsewhere.  The fact that Scary Movie made twenty times as much money as this movie did makes me cry for America's Youth.  America's Youth also made Alanis Morrisette's song Isn't It Ironic? a hit when there wasn't one ironic thing in the song.THIS MOVIE, on the other hand, is full of irony.  Sweet, hilarious irony. I mean, you're talking about a high school ethics teacher who engages in blatantly UN-ethical behavior.  Why?  The levels go very deep  1) He believes in democracy  2)  Reese's character slept with his best friend and got him fired  3)  He's secretly attracted to Reese and he's scared that she'll seduce him too  4)  He can't get his wife pregnant and he hates himself for it  5)  He's stuck in a thankless, dead-end teaching job and all he has to comfort him are his lofty principles (return to #1 and repeat endlessly).A lot of people have slammed Matthew Broderick's acting on this comments page.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Rent a few of his best movies  Brighton Beach Memoirs, Wargames, Name of the Rose.  This guy is a broadway-trained actor who chooses offbeat, solid roles and he takes the risk of not looking like a hero all the time.  When he did play a hero, Ferris Bueller, he created an icon.  So shut up about him being a bad actor.It's okay to not understand something the first time you watch it.  But don't slam it because you don't understand it.  Try going deeper.
