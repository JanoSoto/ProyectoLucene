The script for Black Rain is actually pretty clichéd & amounts to nothing more than a revenge thriller as some hard nosed cop sets out to take down some bad guy after things get personal, the partner is killed, there are fights, near misses & I suppose the thing that Black Rain has going for it to set it apart from the crowd is the setting where a lot of it takes place in Japan as Nick is teamed up with a Japanese cop & the whole clichéd 'fish out of water' scenario takes place. Just think Rush Hour 2 (2001) without as much action or personality or humour & your almost there. Black Rain takes itself extremely seriously which is at odds with action films of the period, if Black Rain had been a Stallone or Schwarzenegger film there would most likely have been one-liners all over the place & a lot more action. Despite it's overlong two hour duration not that much actually happens in Black Rain, it's a fairly basic revenge thriller with a simple plot although exposition scenes can drag on & there are loads of long establishing shots which get boring after a while & slow things down even more. There's the expected attempts to highlight the differences in culture & the way they are between America & Japan (honour, loyalty, etc) but it doesn't amount to much other than a token gesture to a country that provides a pretty backdrop.It is said that Howard Atherton was cinematographer on the majority of Black Rain but resigned & Jan de Bont (who gets final credit) was brought in & he finished it & one thing that Black Rain definitely does have going for it is some very nice cinematography be it Atherton's or de Bont's, the use of colour & movement is great & it seems every shot is grandiose in scale & packed with things to see & little details & I am sure a lot of time went into the look & feel of the film from the streets of New York to the clubs of Japan to the vineyard where the unsatisfying climax takes place. The makers should have spent a bit more time on the script rather than the look of Black Rain & maybe it would have been a better film. The violence is tame with a couple of slit throats, a severed finger & a stabbed hand. There is no sex or nudity although there is some profanity. Apparently Dutch director Paul Verhoeven signed up to make this but dropped out & Scott stepped in.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 this looks great but doesn't have that much action it it apart from an OK shoot-out at the end, Black Rain was actually nominated for two Oscars for Best Sound & Sound Effects although won neither.

The concept of a game coming to life is made even more exciting by encoding prospects of deadly animals such as lions, mysterious mosquitoes and violent talented monkeys. Everything is thought of and what a treat we have in our hands.There is now a new definition of family entertainment, known as Pixar. Since releasing Toy Story after this was released they have been dominating the box office with wonderful family tales about sentimental robots, cooking rats and racing cars. And to rewind the clock back 14 years this picture is to be hailed as the beginning of the end.A truly new concept with very little explanation required and a marvellous array of hormonal characters with breathtaking action and enough humour to make you smile, this was and still is marvellous.Family entertainment now either involves a boy with a wand, Harry something, or sitting in your living room watching Simon Cowell make fun of ordinary folk.The reprisal if you want to call it that of non-animated picture was in 2005 where Jon Favreau attempted a step up from this picture, by using the same concept of a board game coming to life and applied it with a sci-fi edge, set in space. Whilst there were moments of good action it boiled down to being a repetitive ideology of this 1995 classic with not enough quick wit and mistimed action sequences with an egregious sentimental intention of brotherly love.This has none of that. There are no overly soppy sentimental parts as the required drama is justified early on. The action continues consistently with first initial deadly elements before the stakes are raised. Van Pelt adds a sharp intake of breath threw his evidently evil hunter, which actually is never properly explained, but that is the point. Nothing is explained, events just happen and we can sit back and enjoy the fun spilling out from every angle.Johnston is the man in the know as the adventure flows with exquisite timing. The scene with the house flood is a perfect example whilst the monkey motorbike stage shows his ability to do comedy.This truly is a remarkable film and is worth watching again and again for its wondrous story, its lovable collection of characters and easy sharp mind.

That most glorious of popular divas Miss Barbra Streisand plays Katie,a New York smart impecunious Jewish college girl with a passion for lost causes from communism to nuclear disarmament,Mr Robert Redford plays Hubbel,impossibly good - looking,a jock with the soul of an artist. In real life of course they would have loathed each other,but thank God The way we were is not real life,it's Hollywood at its absolute peak with wonderful star performances,a fine supporting cast,first - class production values,a good literate script and a most wonderful title song......misty,water - colour memories...God I wish I could have written that.Sung with heart - breaking intensity by Miss Streisand it has an almost symbiotic relationship with the movie. After establishing a rather prickly relationship at College,the pair meet up again after America has entered the second world war,he a naval officer,she working in radio.He is drunk in a bar and she takes him to her apartment and has remarkably one - sided sex with him in a scene which is redeemed from extreme tackiness by the sensitivity of Miss Streisand's acting. He leaves quickly the next morning not even stopping for a cup of post - coital coffee,but this ill - matched pair are fated to be together and they meet up again and eventually marry when Hubbel's novel is bought by Hollywood. Contemptuous of his friends' smug certainties,Kate rails against the machine once too often and the pair go their separate ways. The last scene,played against a swelling version of the title song is a masterpiece of audience manipulation as Hubbel and Kate meet by chance on the streets of New York,she still hoping she can turn him into what she wants him to be,he knowing he can never live up to her misty,water - coloured romantic ideal.

As he loftily told reporters, X-rated films... are a force that has to be dealt with (and made) part of the establishment. Italian sexploitation king Tinto Brass was hired to direct a screenplay by Gore Vidal. RSC heavyweights Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud and Helen Mirren were cast as those murderous Romans, along with droog-of-the-moment Malcolm McDowell in the title role. This would be a truly groundbreaking picture, a (heavy) breathing Aubrey Beardsley illustration, combining high-art, high-drama and Penthouse Pets placing their ankles behind their ears.It all went terribly wrong. With a trio of emperor-sized egos in bed, the Vidal-Brass-Guccione threesome collapsed under the weight of those old artistic differences. I want to screw theeez Penthouse! the anarchic Tinto informed McDowell, who envisaged Caligula as less an insane tyrant than an anarchic revolutionary, hastening the Senate's downfall from the top. Vidal was barred from the set; lawsuits pinged between Italy and the States; and the 'Penthouse' boss, tired of being dry-humped by Brass, finished the film off himself, inserting extra hardcore, willy-nilly, into the edit. I just tried to survive it McDowell explained later.The result is utterly unique. One's enjoyment (the word used advisedly) may also depend on which version you're exposed to. The theatrical cut is a badly-dubbed, silly old mess, a third-rate Ken Russell. The uncut version, on the other hand, is a fascinating mess, made strange and mad through sheer licentiousness.McDowell, who's on screen for pretty much the whole picture, is, well, very McDowell whether coquettishly swiveling in his boots like a doe-eyed Biggus Dickus, quipping like Lurkio in Up Pompeii (I thought you didn't like virgins, he's chided. I've never known any, comes the reply) or simply shrieking like a bat.Among other outrages, he has sex with his sister (dead or alive); marries the most promiscuous woman in Rome (Mirren); sleeps with his horse; turns the senators wives into prostitutes for an imperial brothel (A logical way to balance the state budget); and rapes a virgin bride on her wedding day. And then fists the groom. The fistee is later charged with being an honest man and therefore a bad Roman, and therefore a traitor. His penis is cut off and fed to the hounds while cackling hags hoist up their togas and urinate on his corpse.You can sort of see what they were trying to do. But it doesn't work. Caligula hiccups from one sorry sequence to the next, seemingly without connective tissue; the whole enlivened, if that's the right word, by repetitive and bewilderingly gratuitous money shots. If you want a picture of the future two hours and 36 minutes, imagine a scrotal sac slapping on a human face forever.Wherever you look, men and women, often in jarringly different film stock, are performing every permutation of straight or gay sex, or vigorously masturbating to issue like glassy-eyed clockwork monkeys. The effect is exactly like watching distinguished thespians politely attempting to ignore a stage invasion at the Old Vic by furiously copulating naturists, right in the middle of a pivotal soliloquy. As if embarrassed, O'Toole bails out early, as does Gielgud. At least for the latter it was a warm-up for Prospero's Books.I had to take my destiny with my own hands, cries Caligula, as everywhere, everyone is taking their own, and other people's, into their hands too. And yet the film - graphic and coy all at once - doesn't work as pornography either. Aside from the interminable zooms, hardcore is generally characterised by static shots, gentle pans and dissolves. Here, an elongated fellatio scene is continually intercut with an extremely camp sequence of soldiers mincing off to war.Elsewhere, some sisters of Sappho have it off for what seems like an eternity, but the jump-cuts and addition of an ethereal chorus with strident orchestration should frustrate even the most determined onanist. During one early tableau, the film - already the cultural equivalent of PT Barnum's Fejee Mermaid - becomes a literal freakshow, featuring a lusty three-eyed woman and a four-handed man. It's about as erotic as a Francis Bacon retrospective.Vidal's defence (pre-Guccione's meddling) was that regardless of whether the events portrayed in the movie were strictly accurate, they were representative of the kind of debauchery the ancient Romans indulged in.

Yet there's probably more historical veracity in Monty Python's Life Of Brian. Roman traitors were almost certainly not buried up to their necks and decapitated by a gigantic moving wall with swirling lawnmower blades, however impressive it looks.Because visually, Caligula is undeniably fabulous Derek Jarman meets Peter Greenaway and Federico Fellini - the alternative name for the film could well be '8½ Inches'.

","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"3 November 2009","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Although its opening ten minutes are melodramatic and a little ludicrous, the remainder of the running time of James Whale's science-fiction classic Bride of Frankenstein proves to not only be superior to its predecessor, but also a surprisingly moving and imaginative motion picture which explores Frankenstein's monster the way that Mary Shelley had originally intended when she conceived of the creature for her novel long before.The original 1931 film also starring Boris Karloff as the monster and Colin Clive as Dr. Frankenstein, sparred and still spars controversy because there's very little resemblance between it and Mary Shelley's Gothic novel. The original film was based more on a stage production of the same name. So for the sequel, now that Whale had further backing from the studio, he decided to more or less take the material from the book that was left out for the original film and incorporate it with a new story to make a worthy sequel. And he did.The film picks up almost immediately where the first one ended. Dr. Frankenstein turns out to be alive after being thrown from the burning windmill by his own creation, who then later turns out to have survived the collapse of the mill and is on a new rampage throughout the country. The movie focuses on two stories. The monster and its excursions and Dr. Frankenstein's acquaintance with another discovery-hungry scientist (Ernest Thesiger), who has also stumbled upon a way to instill life into the dead.I personally am not the biggest fan of the original 1931 Frankenstein, so I had not so high hopes for Bride of Frankenstein.

Rosalind Russell is the sharp-tongued Sylvia Fowler and these three women as well as their friends all go through some of the most incredible relationship trouble I have ever seen for a few people.What makes this movie a classic has to be the cast, but also the sharp and witty dialog that is written. Based on Claire Booth Luce's play, director George Cukor certainly stays faithful to the material, treating it as if it were a stage production, only with film he has the freedom to open up and express the full-blown experience of living in high-society New York in the 1930s. Certainly life was quite stunning back then, but their lifestyle makes their relationships all the more prominent as it is mostly due to their husbands that they live that way. In terms of plot, it does go a little too long, especially a fashion show sequence (done in color) that seemed to take forever. There is also a subplot involving Reno that seemed tacky and the ending is too conventional.

While according to Isiah (34, 8-11), on the day of the Lord's scorched-earth policy, our feathered pals will fill their blackened bellies with the crispy flesh of the damned. So it's appropriate this much maligned bird, intelligent and music-loving, should feature so heavily in Damien Omen II as a demonic fixer for teenage Antichrist Damien Thorn (Scott-Taylor).With hell boy still largely unaware of his destiny, it's the raven who's responsible for much of the murdering, usually by just perching up and belching along to an undulating Jerry Goldsmith choir. That's something those Old Testament prophets neglected to mention; the 'Father of Omens' has a habit of introducing itself with a loud, beak-smacking gut-honk. Not only will it pop your eyes like fried eggs, it'll burp in your face for an aperitif.Set some 7 years after the events of The Omen, the troubled sequel finds the little devil living the high life with uncle Richard (Holden), Richard's second wife Ann (Grant), and gormless cousin Mark (Donat). Damien's turned out marvellously considering his first adopted father was gunned down while trying to turn him into a colander. Charming, cheeky, insouciant and savvy, he's Holden Caulfield with a helmet haircut. And like most boys on the verge of their thirteenth birthday (considered by many cultures to have initiation rites), Damien's going through some startling changes. If only pubic hair and frenzied masturbation were the extent of it.Shorn of Satanic nannies and hell-hounds, but with the burping raven on constant call, facilitating his rise to badness are a bunch of well-appointed acolytes and corporate thugs, smoothing his entry into the obscenely rich and powerful Thorn Industries, which plans to control - or withhold - food distribution in famine-afflicted territories (good business say some, 'unethical' think others - and horribly familiar we say, from the vantage point of the 21st century). Meanwhile, anybody who gets in Damien's way is slaughtered, and which teen hasn't fantasised about that? Following the trajectory of many future captains of industry, Damien is packed off to military school, where brooding academy sergeant Daniel Neff (Henriksen) informs him of his true nature. Why? he howls despairingly. Why me? A playful riff on the traumas of puberty, it's the one truly affecting scene because it's so honest. The remainder can be fed to the flames.If The Omen had a certain vaudevillian grandeur, the sequel feels like a cheap, made-for-TV slasher. More reliable than buses, you can set your watch by the slayings, including a damn good pecking, a deadly plunge under the ice (the most effective set-piece) and death by lift cable, featuring a technician chopped in half width-ways; if the film was aiming to trounce the original's straightforward decapitation, it's just not half as effective in its execution.It makes one wonder what original director Mike Hodges could have done with it, before fleeing production three weeks into the shoot. As Hodges told the 'Guardian' in 2003, during a row about the design budget the apoplectic producer placed a handgun on the table. I said, 'Is that loaded?' And he said, 'Yes.' And then we just looked at each other for a bit. Hodges retains a credit (unlike Leo McKern and Ian Hendry, drowned by sand in the first 10 minutes), but the script might have been so different 'You're a big man, but in you're in bad shape. Now sit down and behave yourself before I summon Baal and Lilith to play conkers with your b****cks. With the exception of Henriksen, and the beguiling Scott-Taylor, the acting is uniformly stilted, and a quick buck for Holden who was originally pencilled in to play Robert Thorn, but passed as he didn't want to star in a film about the devil. Having seen The Omen clean up, he wasted no time hopping on board for the sequel. More pertinently, the original film was shot with an alternative ending in which Damien died but Alan Ladd Jnr, sniffing bucks, nixed the idea. All of which proves once and for all that the love of sequels is actually the root of all evil.

While according to Isiah (34, 8-11), on the day of the Lord's scorched-earth policy, our feathered pals will fill their blackened bellies with the crispy flesh of the damned. So it's appropriate this much maligned bird, intelligent and music-loving, should feature so heavily in Damien Omen II as a demonic fixer for teenage Antichrist Damien Thorn (Scott-Taylor).With hell boy still largely unaware of his destiny, it's the raven who's responsible for much of the murdering, usually by just perching up and belching along to an undulating Jerry Goldsmith choir. That's something those Old Testament prophets neglected to mention; the 'Father of Omens' has a habit of introducing itself with a loud, beak-smacking gut-honk. Not only will it pop your eyes like fried eggs, it'll burp in your face for an aperitif.Set some 7 years after the events of The Omen, the troubled sequel finds the little devil living the high life with uncle Richard (Holden), Richard's second wife Ann (Grant), and gormless cousin Mark (Donat). Damien's turned out marvellously considering his first adopted father was gunned down while trying to turn him into a colander. Charming, cheeky, insouciant and savvy, he's Holden Caulfield with a helmet haircut. And like most boys on the verge of their thirteenth birthday (considered by many cultures to have initiation rites), Damien's going through some startling changes. If only pubic hair and frenzied masturbation were the extent of it.Shorn of Satanic nannies and hell-hounds, but with the burping raven on constant call, facilitating his rise to badness are a bunch of well-appointed acolytes and corporate thugs, smoothing his entry into the obscenely rich and powerful Thorn Industries, which plans to control - or withhold - food distribution in famine-afflicted territories (good business say some, 'unethical' think others - and horribly familiar we say, from the vantage point of the 21st century). Meanwhile, anybody who gets in Damien's way is slaughtered, and which teen hasn't fantasised about that? Following the trajectory of many future captains of industry, Damien is packed off to military school, where brooding academy sergeant Daniel Neff (Henriksen) informs him of his true nature. Why? he howls despairingly. Why me? A playful riff on the traumas of puberty, it's the one truly affecting scene because it's so honest.

The amazing thing, however, is that this didn't kill his career once and for all! Why is this film so bad? Well, the biggest problem is that it's supposed to be a comedy but it's amazingly unfunny. The story is about a guy who wants to be a stand-up comedian and features a supposedly professional comic in the film as well--yet there wasn't a single funny line in the film. It was as if they'd asked Mr. Spock or a robot to write the jokes. Additionally, the rest of the film is written so very poorly that there really isn't anything to recommend the story...nothing.The film is set on a somewhat dilapidated cruise ship. Adam Sandler is a lowly waiter and puts up with lots of abuse from everyone. Frankly, no one is this mistreated on any job and it's hard to find anyone who is a bigger loser than this character. He's just so pathetic that it makes you cringe. At the same time, he looks up to a comic on board the ship that has less charisma and charm than any undertaker! The guy is so obnoxious and untalented that you are left wondering if this guy could get a real job on this planet or only in bad films like this. The answer is actually pretty obvious. I was surprised at this character, actually, as I don't think I've ever heard a character from the 1980s that curses and much or as colorfully as this guy...and yet we are expected to believe he actually gets paid to talk?! As for the rest of the cast, it's mostly a bunch of beauty pageant contestants, though you wonder WHAT sort of pageant this is. That's because some sport sashes that have the names of states or cities and some have sashes with names of countries--but often the women have no accent and look like they can't even spell the names of the countries, let alone having come from there. The best example is the blonde lady who has a typical American accent...and she's Miss Jamaica!? Additionally, the ladies have no charisma or personalities--they are just eye candy--just bodies to jiggle past the screen.So, we have semi-sexy beauty queens and comedians who are about as funny as hemorrhoids--this is NOT a recipe for a good film! About the only thing even halfway likable is Sandler. He's unfunny but seems like a nice young man...a horribly stereotypically Jewish young man saddled with the awful name Shecky Moskowitz. Wow, that was subtle!! The only other positive thing I can say about this film is that it makes you forget some of Sandler's other bombs, such as LITTLE NICKY. Oh, and if you are wondering, I did really enjoy many of his films (such as REIGN ON ME, WATERBOY and THE WEDDING SINGER). I just marvel, however, at how indiscriminate he is in his choices of film projects.Giving a film a 1, for me, is reserved for films such as those of Hershell Gordon Lewis, Ed Wood, Al Adamson, Ted Mikels and the like. I don't give this score out routinely but I do think this film also deserves this score, as it is unlikable, cheap and stupid from start to finish and it's obvious why this film is currently ranked within the 100 worst films of all time on IMDb.
