The film's soulful, powerful, amazing and energetic musical numbers equally compliment its bold, crazy SNL-inspired comedic strokes. Has any movie ever reached the heights of pure lunacy and divine, get-up-and-dance musical performances like this one? I love this movie like possibly no other. It reaffirms a joy in the shared experience of music, it captures that crazy 70's comedic aesthetic, and it's a hell of a lot of fun. Period.Crafted on the wispiest of premises, THE BLUES BROTHERS is a journey that begins as a mere traffic infraction and ends as a tribute to the (at the time) forgotten musical inspirations of James Brown, Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, John Lee Hooker and even Sam and Dave - scored to the destruction of downtown Chicago. This movie truly is a revelation. Why? It loves and breathes the music of the Windy City blues and Memphis soul, and wears its influences, tributes and loves on its rather cigarette-burned and motor oil-stained sleeves. Written by SNL's Dan Aykroyd and director John Landis, the film follows the Blues Brothers John Belushi and Aykroyd through a magical quest to save the orphanage that the two grew up in - by paying up the $5000 back taxes on the place. The film breezes thru it's 133 minutes (longer if you enjoy the new Pickwick Preview DVD Special Edition) with such sweet, happy insanity as it follows Aykroyd & Belushi as they try to reassemble their old, misplaced band (featuring kings of the 60's Stax movement, Steve Cropper & Donald 'Duck' Dunn, as well as studio primos Tom Malone, Lou Marini, Alan Rubin and Murphy (The Big Bus) Dunne) to play a special benefit concert.Landis's penchant for anti-establishment Animal House style laughs are here in full force. The film's anarchic DNA finds an amazing 20+ minute car chase through the streets and boroughs of Chicago coupled with a crazy, smart thumbed-nose screenplay. It has as much fun with the straight outside city limits regulars who frequent country-hick bars as with the blues-drenched 78rpm vinyl fantasyland that is fuelled by never-say-die spirit and determination where the underdogs hold all the cards and sing a pretty great song or two.Stocked full of cameos including Henry Laugh In Gibson, Carrie Fisher, John Candy and even director Steven Spielberg (!) it's the music and goodwill of the endeavour that completely reminds us of the healing power of music, the energy of free-spiritedness, and the beauty of off-the-wall, collision-course comedy. 1980's THE BLUES BROTHERS is an absolutely perfect film.

John Carpenter and Debra Hill created the most suspenseful, creepy, and terrifying movie of all time with this classic chiller.  Michael Myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired scores of imitators, such as Jason Vorhees (Friday the 13th), The Miner (My Bloody Valentine), and Charlie Puckett (The Night Brings Charlie). Okay, so I got a little obscure there, but it just goes to show you the impact that this movie had on the entire horror genre.  No longer did a monster have to come from King Tut's tomb or from Dr. Frankenstein's lab. He could be created in the cozy little neighborhoods of suburbia.  And on The Night He Came Home...Haddonfield, Illinois and the viewers would never be the same.  There are many aspects of this movie that make it the crowning jewel of horror movies.  First is the setting...it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood.  Many of us who grew up in an area such as this can easily identify with the characters.  This is the type of neighborhood where you feel safe, but if trouble starts to brew, nobody wants to lift a finger to get involved (especially when a heavy-breathing madman is trying to skewer our young heroine.)  Along with the setting, the movie takes place on Halloween!!  The scariest night of the year!  While most people are carving jack-o-lanterns, Michael Myers is looking to carve up some teenie-boppers.  Besides the setting, there is some great acting. Jamie Lee Curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine, Laurie Strode, a goody-two-shoes high-schooler who can never seem to find a date.  However, it is Donald Pleasance, as Dr. Sam Loomis, who really steals the show. His portrayal of the good doctor, who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of Michael Myers and feels compelled to send him to Hell once and for all, is the stuff of horror legend.  However, it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film.  Once you hear it, you will never forget it.  I also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture.  Nowadays, they seem to sharpen up the image of every movie, giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of.  In Halloween, John Carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at Michael Myers.  He always seems like he is a part of the shadows, and, I think that is what makes him so terrifying.  There are many scenes where Michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens (unbeknownst to them), which adds to his creepiness.  If you think about, some wacko could be watching you right now and you wouldn't even know it. Unfortunately for our teenagers (and fortunately for us horror fans), when they find Michael, he's not looking for candy on this Halloween night..he's looking for blood.  Finally, Michael Myers, himself, is a key element to this movie's effectiveness.  His relentless pursuit of Laurie Strode makes him seem like the killer who will never stop.  He is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life.  So,if you have not seen this movie (if there are still some of you out there who haven't, or even if you have), grab some popcorn, turn off every light, pop this into the old DVD and watch in fright.

Along with the setting, the movie takes place on Halloween!!  The scariest night of the year!  While most people are carving jack-o-lanterns, Michael Myers is looking to carve up some teenie-boppers.  Besides the setting, there is some great acting. Jamie Lee Curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine, Laurie Strode, a goody-two-shoes high-schooler who can never seem to find a date.  However, it is Donald Pleasance, as Dr. Sam Loomis, who really steals the show. His portrayal of the good doctor, who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of Michael Myers and feels compelled to send him to Hell once and for all, is the stuff of horror legend.  However, it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film.  Once you hear it, you will never forget it.  I also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture.  Nowadays, they seem to sharpen up the image of every movie, giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of.  In Halloween, John Carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at Michael Myers.  He always seems like he is a part of the shadows, and, I think that is what makes him so terrifying.  There are many scenes where Michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens (unbeknownst to them), which adds to his creepiness.  If you think about, some wacko could be watching you right now and you wouldn't even know it. Unfortunately for our teenagers (and fortunately for us horror fans), when they find Michael, he's not looking for candy on this Halloween night..he's looking for blood.  Finally, Michael Myers, himself, is a key element to this movie's effectiveness.  His relentless pursuit of Laurie Strode makes him seem like the killer who will never stop.  He is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life.  So,if you have not seen this movie (if there are still some of you out there who haven't, or even if you have), grab some popcorn, turn off every light, pop this into the old DVD and watch in fright.  Trick or Treat!

Now THAT'S a tragedy which the 20th and 21st centuries should be able to relate to, and it gives ROMEO AND JULIET a contemporary relevance which this film brought out beautifully.Far too much is made of the fact that the director gave the play a modern setting. Shakespeare modernized his settings, and there's no reason we can't do the same Shakespeare gives HAMLET, for example, an Elizabethan setting even though the original Hamlet is supposed to have lived in pre-Viking and pagan times. Modern settings are entirely appropriate to Shakespeare.I think Danes and DiCaprio are perfectly cast, and I think the Bard would approve. Romeo is suitably impulsive, unintellectual but very plain and honest about his love, just the right combination of punky and sensitive, while Juliet is---well, Juliet. This film has by far the best Tybalt I've ever seen, while Father Laurence all but steals the show. The cast is uniformly fine (except Romeo's sidekick Mercutio wasn't there at all; Zeferelli did much better to make him into an aging stud).Nothing's perfect.

He is still split from his (ex)-wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) has since passed to the other side, though rumors have it his character was originally in Ford and Mario Puzo's script, only to be dumped when Duvall turned down the script because he believed Pacino was getting too much attention.

He's been trying to turn his business into legit dealings for a while now, and he realizes that the sins of his past will never completely go away.

He is bent on becoming an opera singer, to turn from his family's past and ignore his father's pleads. Michael is left with some difficult choices, and we see that all the power in the world can't control the inevitable.The Godfather Part III has its flaws. One of them is the casting of Michael's daughter with Coppola's daughter - she has, one might say, no acting ability whatsoever. Garcia is bright and talented, and fits the part he is playing. Pacino isn't quite as energetic and powerful as he was in the first two films, in fact he looks pretty tired here, but I believe that's the point.Some people really hate this film. I thought it was quite good. It's a good continuation, though I do not hesitate to admit it could have been much better. The film seems a bit corny at times, and there are some bad casting choices, one of which I have already mentioned above. But it is an entertaining film, one that no Godfather fan should go without seeing. It's a worthy (hopefully) last installment, one that gives more of the same but still manages to hold the audience's interest.There are rumors flying everywhere of yet another Godfather entry, but quite honestly I think it's a bad decision. They should leave the series as it is and move on to other projects. Puzo is dead. Coppola hasn't made a good film in years - heck, he hasn't even produced a good film in years. Al Pacino's character would be hard to bring back, and if you've seen this film you know what I'm talking about. A prequel would just be messy and unexplained, not to mention confusing.

Which, looking back at twenty years from now, probably won't amount to a hill of beans. But it's a start.4.5\/5 stars -John Ulmer ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"15 September 2003","score":"102 out of 150 people found the following review useful","review":"  The Godfather Part III isn't really a necessary sequel, and to be truthful it's not really one of the best sequels in recent memory, but is it a bad film? No. In fact, had it not been for the extraordinary first two films, I firmly believe this movie would have been hailed as an epic; but due to such a broad expanse of years from the second film (1974) to this one (1990), audiences were given too much time to work up extreme expectations, especially with the major success of the first sequel. Many people just expected another equal sequel. It's just a good sequel.Al Pacino returns to his role of Don Michael Corleone, much older since we last saw him and with a daughter (Sofia Coppola, Francis' daughter). He is still split from his (ex)-wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) has since passed to the other side, though rumors have it his character was originally in Ford and Mario Puzo's script, only to be dumped when Duvall turned down the script because he believed Pacino was getting too much attention. (Though I have my doubts over the accuracy of that rumor.)Michael wants out of the Mafia. He wants to work legitimate. He's been trying to turn his business into legit dealings for a while now, and he realizes that the sins of his past will never completely go away. He decides to hand the reigns of power over to his ex-brother Fredo's son (Andy Garcia), a young, eager soul with energy and excitement. But things do not go so well. Michael tries to be a mentor to his trainee but it is a difficult task. Michael goes through turbulent times, not to mention that he must deal with his daughter falling in love with the future head of the family (they're cousins, which, when you think about it, is just plain nasty).Michael tries to get his son interested in becoming the head of the family, but he will have no part of it. He is bent on becoming an opera singer, to turn from his family's past and ignore his father's pleads. Michael is left with some difficult choices, and we see that all the power in the world can't control the inevitable.The Godfather Part III has its flaws. One of them is the casting of Michael's daughter with Coppola's daughter - she has, one might say, no acting ability whatsoever. Garcia is bright and talented, and fits the part he is playing. Pacino isn't quite as energetic and powerful as he was in the first two films, in fact he looks pretty tired here, but I believe that's the point.Some people really hate this film. I thought it was quite good. It's a good continuation, though I do not hesitate to admit it could have been much better. The film seems a bit corny at times, and there are some bad casting choices, one of which I have already mentioned above. But it is an entertaining film, one that no Godfather fan should go without seeing. It's a worthy (hopefully) last installment, one that gives more of the same but still manages to hold the audience's interest.There are rumors flying everywhere of yet another Godfather entry, but quite honestly I think it's a bad decision. They should leave the series as it is and move on to other projects. Puzo is dead. Coppola hasn't made a good film in years - heck, he hasn't even produced a good film in years. Al Pacino's character would be hard to bring back, and if you've seen this film you know what I'm talking about. A prequel would just be messy and unexplained, not to mention confusing. To follow Andy Garcia's character would seem pointless - some things should be left to our imagination. I doubt as to the importance of another sequel, as it would, at this point, just be a cash-in.The script by Coppola and Puzo is interesting, but it seems too try a bit too hard to be an epic at times. It just serves as a reminder that this film was not needed as an intallment in the series. The Godfather Part was great, The Godfather Part II was superb, The Godfather Part III is probably the best film of 1990. Which, looking back at twenty years from now, probably won't amount to a hill of beans.

We are left wondering, if there really was a Blair Witch, or if the missing student, Josh, was the Blair Witch.  Perhaps a clever little whodunnit, but not even close to scary.  Not to mention, I prefer a score to my horror movies. It adds so much atmosphere (take Halloween for instance).  I also prefer to see at least a glimpse of the killer or the evil or whatever it is that makes this a horror movie.  Perhaps the two clowns who did this film couldn't afford to have a monster.  Well, now they can after taking all of us suckers to the cleaners.  And for all those nincompoops who thought that this movie was for real, the short bus will be around shortly to pick you up.  Well, I hope this review shows you that this movie is a total waste of time, money, and anticipation for horror fans.  What seemed like an original idea turned into a total sham?  When I finish watching a horror movie, I want the fright to stay with me, such as when I go into the woods, I think Jason Vorhees, or if I go to a cemetery, I think Tall Man.  When I think of Blair Witch, I think of...hmmm...what was I supposed to be scared of?  The wind?

Cohen at first; it annoyed the heck out of me. but then after a second time watching the music almost became my favorite part. it's more of a narration than a soundtrack. & julie christie is very good, a subtle performance as, basically, the first and only thing mccabe has any feelings for - besides himself. and also shelley duvall, keith carradine (in a very brutal scene here), and rene alberques  added great performances. everything in this movie was like paint falling perfectly into place onto the screen. the whore's were gross and realistic and not like most prostitutes in movies, that is, they were bottom of the barrell gals for a bottom of the barrel town. but anyhow this is a materpiece and i have a feeling that, like THE LONG GOODBYE, i am going to watch this flick over and over, and over and over again...
