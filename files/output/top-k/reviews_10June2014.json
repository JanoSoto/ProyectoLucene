This movie is purely dependent on the person watching the movie, what he\/she takes from it.The film was made in 1971, some 43 years before I'm writing this review. I have more pros then cons about this movie, but let's start with the cons. I felt the movie did not shock me as some other movies have, perhaps this is because in nearly half a century we have wised up to the deep, dark underbelly of this world or quite simply I have been exposed to it. Further to this, the film was a bit long to watch in one sitting. Finally, the actual lingo was a bit to hard to understand, and I've lived in England for 11 years now!The positives were I thought the actual cinematography and filming of this was pretty good, and the main protagonists acting was second-to- none. More to the point, I really adore how this movie depicts that as a criminal, he continued to get away with multiple crimes but it was only once he became good (by force, may I add) that he was well and truly eaten up by the world. Whilst harsh, it shows that the world we live in now may not have much space left for the pure of heart anymore. To follow from this, I like how the main character shows that each human is different, and how when it comes to someone's mental state, anything can trigger a reaction unexpected. The best example of this is his reaction to Beethoven's 9th symphony. I especially like how the film portrays the underhanded dealings of a government, summed up in the scene at the end with the main character sitting with the Minister, whom speaks so politically in a way that basically depicts the sneaky way in which politicians go about their business.Whilst I only gave this film a 7, I would say it is a much watch as there is something oddly fascinating about this film, and kudos to the director for filming it in such a way that everyone has a different opinion and focal point on the movie.

Rambo First Blood Part II is certainly still a vivid portrayal of the Rambo character and still filled with moments that make clear unadulterated statements about war and those left behind to die. It is however much more an action film than First Blood.This movie centers on Rambo, freed from prison by the US government to re-enter Vietnam and locate prisoners of war. Unbeknownst to him, he's not intended to find anything and is expected to return empty handed. When he actually does find POW's alive and still being held by the Vietnamese, he refuses to leave them behind and engages in a one man war to save his former comrades.Like all of the Rambo films, this movie is beautifully made and nearly flawless in its production. Stallone plays Rambo just as he did in First Blood. When you see him in character, it's so clear that the role to him means much more than it would for most. Richard Crenna returns as Colonel Trautmen and once again plays his role perfectly as well. A really nice surprise in this movie though are a couple of other familiar Hollywood faces.There's Charles Napier playing a corrupt to the bone CIA agent and playing it extremely well. Napier is known amongst hardcore film fans for often playing a hard ass with a load of jerk sprinkled on top. His role here is no exception. Obviously Napier himself isn't like that but somehow or another it just became a running thing for him in movies. Probably because he's so dam good at it. We also see Steven Berkoff, a very well known actor from such titles as A Clockwork Orange and Octopussy. But most notably to my mind, we see Martin Kove.While Kove has played many roles in his career, I love him best as the ruthless leader of the Cobra Kai Dojo in 1985's Karate Kid. That character has stuck in my mind for years and will probably never leave. Kove played it so ridiculously well that it almost made the character enviable even though he was one of the bad guys. If I were in a bad situation and I saw him in his Cobra Kai uniform, I'd be hiding behind him in a heartbeat...but back to First Blood II. Here he plays a mercenary, hired to get Rambo in and out of Vietnam and to back him up if Rambo runs into trouble. Kove's character however being a mercenary is only in it for the money. When the time comes to choose between saving Rambo and a rescued POW or following orders and abandoning them, he simply fly's away in his helicopter and leaves them to be captured by the enemy never even looking back. Fear not, he gets his later on in a most satisfying way and Kove even manages to play that moment out hilariously well.When I say this is more a pure action film than First Blood, don't get me wrong. It's a great movie and it has it's moments that are poignant and do bring back memories of the previous film. It's simply that there is a lot more action here. It makes sense however when you consider the situation or rather, the story of the film. There has to be more action when the main character is trapped behind enemy lines and facing off against countless Vietnamese soldiers backed by Russian military. If there wasn't more action, if it wasn't a tougher battle for Rambo, the movie would lose all credibility. As I've said though, First Blood II is still very well written, directed and edited. The location filming is excellent and the acting is spot on all around.If your looking for the poignancy of First Blood, I will say this. A few lines spoken by Rambo at the end of the film bring that rushing back and really hit you hard. Also, as with the first film this movie is well scored and has an excellent theme song called Peace In Our Life sung by none other than Frank Stallone, Sylvester Stallone's brother. It's not quite Dan Hill's It's a Long Road the theme from First Blood but Peace In Our Life is dam close to it in the way that both songs tug at your heart and your mind. Do yourself a favor, listen to the last few lines Rambo speaks in this movie and then just sit and let the credits roll while Peace In Our Life plays.

All the seven murders are committed very sadistically as the victims are badly mutilated. The mutilations have the purpose of symbolizing the seven deadly sins described in the Bible. David Mills is the new homicide detective and he is aided by the soon to retire William Sommerset. The difference between old 'veteran' Sommerset and 'rookie' Mills brings quite some conflicts in the beginning, but eventually the both of them agree that if they want to catch the killer, they will have to work together and make use of each other's strengths. The movie takes some major twists and turns at the end, and this does contribute to giving the movie a satisfying ending. We think Se7en is a good movie. The story behind the murders with the seven sins connected to it makes you think, whether or not the murders were really that bad, or did the victims (sort of) deserve it? Asking yourself this question is the result of the strong movie, as you would normally not even consider if a murder was right or not. As mentioned before, the movie builds up to the end, which does live up to the expectations created by the rest of the film, as the ending is just as dramatic and well done as the other parts of the film, which leaves you with a satisfied feeling. Editing plays a very big and important role in the production of movies, and this movie is no exception. Basically, everything that is even slightly altered from the recorded parts is included in the category editing. Editing therefore is making changes in filmed fragments, and putting these changed fragments together to form a fluent and pleasant to watch movie. An editor therefore has to make a lot of decisions. What parts should he choose to put together to create the right feeling and to satisfy the producer? why should he choose these? Etc. Editing, however, is not just used to make the movie look good or catchy, it's also used to give the audience a certain feeling, imprinted in their minds by the director. In this way, the director can set the experience of the movie to his hand. Using things such as different lighting, camera height, music and shot length, the movie directors can give the audience certain opinions about the characters without even having the character say a single word. Characters with power are often filmed from a low perspective, as this symbolizes them being greater than you. Meanwhile, meaner or evil characters often have a darker glow around them and different background music, because this creates tension. Difference in Shot length shows a difference in the amount of energy used. The shorter the shots, the more energy is in the actions. For example, in a shooter, shots constantly change from one to the other, whereas in a love-story, the shot length is way longer, to make it more romantic and lovable. This movie includes a lot of dramatic and painful scenes, wherein the director made use of a range of different shot transitions, to highlight the different amounts of tension in the scenes. In order to make sure that the message is communicated to the audience, they use longer shots and they pause between the monologues. In this way, the audience is forced to think about what's being said and what the message of the movie is. When energetic and active scenes are concerned, the director chose for short shot length, and fast shot transitions, in order to give the scenes more speed. The film was shot in a way that is uncommon in popular films. It was shot in a special way using special lighting, making lots of shadows and silhouettes. The film was then edited with a process called C.C.E, which enhances the quality of the lights, making the dark parts darker and the light parts whiter. This alteration from the original is permanent. Most of the colors used are shades of black and grey, so that parts of the images with primary colors (red, yellow and blue) stand out in contrast. In this way, red is often used, because this reminds the people of blood. The colors of this movie have a fakish look. This way, the viewer gets the impression that they watch a coloured-in black and white movie. This sequence is called neo-Gothic, and in my opinion fits well with the story and the rest of the movie, wherein mainly darker colors are used which corresponds with the dark murder theme. Although this is a pretty rad movie, sometimes scenes can get a bit too slow for our taste. This made us lose track of the story a bit, halfway through, and as a result we had to rewind some parts, to understand them. I have given this movie some thought and can conclude that the directors and producers made an excellent decision regarding the choosing of the actors starring this movie. Morgan Freeman is perfectly able to capture dramatic moments, making the viewers feel sympathy for the actor, and thus making them follow the story better. Likewise we think Brad Pitt is well chosen too, because he is highly experienced with action and shooting scenes. Furthermore, the storyline isn't as linear as one would expect from a crime thriller. On the one hand it's a straightforward murder mystery, but on the other hand there are loads of plot twists to make the movie more interesting and challenging to understand. We think it's a highly interesting movie. We would definitely recommend this movie, because it is an highly enjoyable and interesting story, and the way they made use of the different kinds of filming editing gives this story even more tension when needed.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"10 June 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The movie Se7en tells the story of two homicide detectives, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and William Sommerset (Morgan Freeman), who try to solve seven mysterious murders. All the seven murders are committed very sadistically as the victims are badly mutilated. The mutilations have the purpose of symbolizing the seven deadly sins described in the Bible. David Mills is the new homicide detective and he is aided by the soon to retire William Sommerset. The difference between old 'veteran' Sommerset and 'rookie' Mills brings quite some conflicts in the beginning, but eventually the both of them agree that if they want to catch the killer, they will have to work together and make use of each other's strengths. The movie takes some major twists and turns at the end, and this does contribute to giving the movie a satisfying ending. We think Se7en is a good movie. The story behind the murders with the seven sins connected to it makes you think, whether or not the murders were really that bad, or did the victims (sort of) deserve it? Asking yourself this question is the result of the strong movie, as you would normally not even consider if a murder was right or not. As mentioned before, the movie builds up to the end, which does live up to the expectations created by the rest of the film, as the ending is just as dramatic and well done as the other parts of the film, which leaves you with a satisfied feeling. Editing plays a very big and important role in the production of movies, and this movie is no exception. Basically, everything that is even slightly altered from the recorded parts is included in the category editing. Editing therefore is making changes in filmed fragments, and putting these changed fragments together to form a fluent and pleasant to watch movie. An editor therefore has to make a lot of decisions. What parts should he choose to put together to create the right feeling and to satisfy the producer? why should he choose these? Etc. Editing, however, is not just used to make the movie look good or catchy, it's also used to give the audience a certain feeling, imprinted in their minds by the director. In this way, the director can set the experience of the movie to his hand. Using things such as different lighting, camera height, music and shot length, the movie directors can give the audience certain opinions about the characters without even having the character say a single word. Characters with power are often filmed from a low perspective, as this symbolizes them being greater than you. Meanwhile, meaner or evil characters often have a darker glow around them and different background music, because this creates tension. Difference in Shot length shows a difference in the amount of energy used. The shorter the shots, the more energy is in the actions. For example, in a shooter, shots constantly change from one to the other, whereas in a love-story, the shot length is way longer, to make it more romantic and lovable. This movie includes a lot of dramatic and painful scenes, wherein the director made use of a range of different shot transitions, to highlight the different amounts of tension in the scenes. In order to make sure that the message is communicated to the audience, they use longer shots and they pause between the monologues. In this way, the audience is forced to think about what's being said and what the message of the movie is. When energetic and active scenes are concerned, the director chose for short shot length, and fast shot transitions, in order to give the scenes more speed. The film was shot in a way that is uncommon in popular films. It was shot in a special way using special lighting, making lots of shadows and silhouettes. The film was then edited with a process called C.C.E, which enhances the quality of the lights, making the dark parts darker and the light parts whiter. This alteration from the original is permanent. Most of the colors used are shades of black and grey, so that parts of the images with primary colors (red, yellow and blue) stand out in contrast. In this way, red is often used, because this reminds the people of blood. The colors of this movie have a fakish look. This way, the viewer gets the impression that they watch a coloured-in black and white movie. This sequence is called neo-Gothic, and in my opinion fits well with the story and the rest of the movie, wherein mainly darker colors are used which corresponds with the dark murder theme. Although this is a pretty rad movie, sometimes scenes can get a bit too slow for our taste. This made us lose track of the story a bit, halfway through, and as a result we had to rewind some parts, to understand them. I have given this movie some thought and can conclude that the directors and producers made an excellent decision regarding the choosing of the actors starring this movie. Morgan Freeman is perfectly able to capture dramatic moments, making the viewers feel sympathy for the actor, and thus making them follow the story better. Likewise we think Brad Pitt is well chosen too, because he is highly experienced with action and shooting scenes. Furthermore, the storyline isn't as linear as one would expect from a crime thriller. On the one hand it's a straightforward murder mystery, but on the other hand there are loads of plot twists to make the movie more interesting and challenging to understand. We think it's a highly interesting movie. We would definitely recommend this movie, because it is an highly enjoyable and interesting story, and the way they made use of the different kinds of filming editing gives this story even more tension when needed.

In the midst of all this, there came, this wonderful and provocative film. A true classic. It's a great movie to watch, but it's such a downer. Directed by Jack Arnold, the film is based off, Richard Matheson's novel, 'The Shrinking Man'. Richard Matheson came up with the idea, while watching an apparently incidental during the 1953's musical, Let's Do it Again', in which an actor puts on hat, belonging to someone else whom is has a much bigger head. This became the basis for one of the best sci-fi novels of the 1950s. The book was able to capture the nuclear war fears of the shifting Cold-war era and the different politics of each party. While, its premise might seem like B-Movie material, Richard Matheson wrote the story with such detail, tragedy and drama that makes it watchable, from start to finish. The movie follows that same direction. The movie is about Scott Carey (Grant Williams) a happy marriage businessman while on vacation, off the coast of California got exposes to a large, strange poisonous cloud. The radioactive material from the cloud start to have a weird react to Scott's body, forcing him to get smaller and smaller by the day. Scott Carey's life become a living hell as he's force to cope with his every changing standards. The movie depth with the psychological toll of the man whom afraid of what's happening to him, and hates how other people are reacting to him. The movie has no idea of dwarfism looks like, but you really get a taste of how life is like, for people that go through dwarfism. While, you don't see him suffer, the physical genetic maleffects of dwarfism, like malformed bones or bowleg or knock knee deformities. You see him go through somewhat of a castration anxiety in his masculinity. A good example of this, is how bitter and angry, he got with his wife, Louise Carey (Randy Stuart), as she began to tower over him, accusing her of treating him like a child. You really see his lost-love life. While the movie never focus on the sexual tension between the two, due to 1950's censorship, you get hints of it, through the crafty words, they were able to use to show their tense relationship. It's get harder and harder for him to find his libido. Estranged from his wife, you feel for him as he tries to find, any sense of connection. Great use of symbolism, when Carey's wedding ring slides off his finger. I'm glad, they at less, took the way too disturbing behavior of him turning into a sexual predator, trying to get with the babysitter. That would had ruin the film for me. The movie really digs deeper, as Carey's life get more limited. Each day become more of a day to day survival when Carey shrink to the size of a bug, forcing him to fight against house cats, and terrifying tarantula. This is where the best of special effects play in. For a 50s low-budget film, while the special effects are dated, the effects are impressive. The use of rear projection, split screen and model effects all help convey Carey's dwindling size. The best sci-fi is the kind that focuses on the people, rather than the technology. Take a premise, speculate how it will affect human behavior and interaction, and you get profound movies like this. The acting in this movie are great from Grant Williams as the lead, to its supporting cast. There are some different between the book and the movie, such as Carey's daughter being absent. The structure, too has been significantly altered, as the film has no flashbacks to his happier days. The film has this linear dogmatic narrative. The result is a film is a doom-laden tone. No wonder, why the director felt it necessary to add a somewhat optimism tone to the bittersweet ending. This is actually a unique way to end a movie, and in a way inspiration and very easy to relate to. We all sometimes have to try to find that kind of closure in real life. The movie really become haunting as it pluck at our fears about illness, loss of control, and death. All handle a pulpy concept with intelligence and integrity. The film won the first Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation presented in 1958 by the World Science Fiction Convention. In 2009 it was named to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being culturally, historically or aesthetically significant and will be preserved for all time. Matheson made a number of novel sequel to the film, such as 2006's Fantastic Little Girl (alternately titled The Fantastic Shrinking Girl), but a film version was never produced as of this writing. Indeed, a 1981's The Incredible Shrinking Woman movie was made, but it little to do with the original source material, and play off as a comedy. 1989's Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is by far the best movie since this movie to use the shrinking Sci-Fiction concept. Overall A great philosophical film worth watching. If a remake movie was to be made, let's hope, it's keep the emotional depth needed.

Hobbes of course feels that the crimes don't make sense, and his encounter with Davidtz's character, who studies angels and spirits, is a turning point.There are of course hundreds of horror films with similar kinds of plots, and what makes this one rise above most of them is how well made it is. Credit here goes beyond Washington, though he's clearly key. The cinematographer, Newton Thomas Sigel, is excellent (he also shot Three Kings and Drive) and the coherence of the complex movie is partly because of a consistent visual flow.Director Gregory Hoblit is mostly a TV guy, but around the time of this movie he made a few others with similar success, including Fracture which is quite good in the same solid way and Primal Fear which has a terrific performance by Edward Norton.Fallen does come out of a familiar mold, and that is one reason why it is satisfying (many of us know we like this kind of film) and also limited ultimately (it isn't completely fresh, after all). I suspect nearly everyone will like aspects of this, even if the most demanding viewer will groan at some of the clichés. The acting alone rises up in so many cases, the rest is easy to really like.

It's genre is both science fiction and horror and it takes about two hours. The movie Alien stars, Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm and Yaphet Kotto.The story takes place in 2122. A spaceship travels to planet Earth, loaded with ore. There are seven people present on the spaceship which are Dallas, Ash, Kane, Parker Brett and two women. The film starts with a signal being sent out by another planet to the spaceship. The spaceship has an advanced computer on board which they call the Mother. The Mother reacts to the signal of the unknown planet after which the spaceship changes course towards the planet. The members of the spaceship land on the planet and start investigating. They find an old crashed spaceship and enter it. Firstly they find a pilot's dead body. After that, they find eggs of which one cracks. A strange organism comes out and attacks one of the spaceship members, Kane. Kane is unconscious and the other spaceship members bring him back to their own spaceship. The strange organism sucked itself to the face of Kane. The others try to get it off and the organism started to produce a certain fluid which creates holes in the spaceship. They leave the room to look at how bad the damage is, and when they come back the organism has strangely disappeared. Kane came back to conscious and cannot remember anything. They start looking for the organism and find it dead on the ground. In the evening when the group members are having dinner, Kane becomes ill and another strange organism, with a tail this time, comes out of his chest. The organism flees and the spaceship members start looking for the organism. They find its skin and it looked like it had melted. Brett finds the organism which had changed since the last time they saw it coming out of Kane's chest. It became bigger, the tail became sharp, and got very large teeth and a stabbing tongue. The creature kills Brett immediately. Dallas comes up with the idea to use a flame thrower to drive away the creature back in to space. While Dallas is on his mission, the others hear him scream, Dallas seems to have been disappeared.The transport company of the spaceship orders the members of the spaceship not to kill the creature but to catch it for investigation. Ash starts attacking Ripley when he hears about this dangerous request. Parker then attacks Ash to protect Ripley after which Ash turns out to be a robot. The rest of the spaceship members destroy him\/it, and want to leave the spaceship with the backup capsule. Before they leave, they first have to search for coolant for the shuttle and the cat they lost in the beginning. When Ripley and Jones start searching for the cat and the rest for the coolant, Ripley hears the others scream. When Ripley and Jones run towards the screaming but the others are already killed. Ripley and Jones decide to leave to the backup capsule and blow up the spaceship. When the spaceship is blown up and Jones and Ripley are in the backup capsule, they find out the creature is inside the backup capsule. Ripley succeeds in getting it out. Finally they can start the cryosleep, and they start waiting for another spaceship to find them&#x85;General opinion We share the opinion that the movie 'Alien' is a bit old-fashioned and outdated. Nowadays we are able to create spectacular effects in movies which make horror\/science-fiction movies very realistic and frightening. Since this movie is produced in 1979, the techniques and special effects used to create drama are not very impressive to us. We do understand that people would find it impressive at that time because they weren't used to other techniques yet. What is positive about the movie is that right from the beginning there is a suspicion of something scary to happen. The tension is built up slowly, so the scary moments do not come all out of nowhere. The camera-work of the movie helps the tension being built up. By filming from certain angles, certain objects look bigger and more scary. By very fast camera movements the tension also increases. The dark setting of the movie also adds to a scary atmosphere of the horror movie. Analysis and detailed opinion The first part of the movie where they enter the spaceship and travel was quite boring and extensive. However the part where an unknown creature appeared was very shocking and unexpected, but we did like the fact that something finally happened. The scene in the movie where the creature came out of Kane's chest was one of the scariest parts of the movie because it was unpleasant to look at. A very unexpected twist to the story is when it turns out that Ash is a robot, nobody saw this coming. For us, it was a bit unnecessary because it does not add anything to the story besides drama. The part where the spaceship members are being killed is shocking and a bit disgusting. The end where Ripley and Jones succeed in leaving the spaceship without the creature is a quite ''happy'' ending and gives us a good closure. Although not everyone has survived, it is a good ending.Conclusion and opinion Alien is an intense movie with lots of suspense. Most people refer to the movie as being one of the classiest movies in its genre. We do not quite agree with that opinion because of the information above about the old-fashioned atmosphere of the movie. Not everyone would like this movie because of the dark setting, which is another factor why we disliked this movie. When watching the movie, you should take into account that it may contain scary en frightening images, which not everyone can handle.

Finally they can start the cryosleep, and they start waiting for another spaceship to find them&#x85;General opinion We share the opinion that the movie 'Alien' is a bit old-fashioned and outdated. Nowadays we are able to create spectacular effects in movies which make horror\/science-fiction movies very realistic and frightening. Since this movie is produced in 1979, the techniques and special effects used to create drama are not very impressive to us. We do understand that people would find it impressive at that time because they weren't used to other techniques yet. What is positive about the movie is that right from the beginning there is a suspicion of something scary to happen. The tension is built up slowly, so the scary moments do not come all out of nowhere. The camera-work of the movie helps the tension being built up. By filming from certain angles, certain objects look bigger and more scary. By very fast camera movements the tension also increases. The dark setting of the movie also adds to a scary atmosphere of the horror movie. Analysis and detailed opinion The first part of the movie where they enter the spaceship and travel was quite boring and extensive. However the part where an unknown creature appeared was very shocking and unexpected, but we did like the fact that something finally happened. The scene in the movie where the creature came out of Kane's chest was one of the scariest parts of the movie because it was unpleasant to look at. A very unexpected twist to the story is when it turns out that Ash is a robot, nobody saw this coming. For us, it was a bit unnecessary because it does not add anything to the story besides drama. The part where the spaceship members are being killed is shocking and a bit disgusting. The end where Ripley and Jones succeed in leaving the spaceship without the creature is a quite ''happy'' ending and gives us a good closure. Although not everyone has survived, it is a good ending.Conclusion and opinion Alien is an intense movie with lots of suspense. Most people refer to the movie as being one of the classiest movies in its genre. We do not quite agree with that opinion because of the information above about the old-fashioned atmosphere of the movie. Not everyone would like this movie because of the dark setting, which is another factor why we disliked this movie. When watching the movie, you should take into account that it may contain scary en frightening images, which not everyone can handle.

It's genre is both science fiction and horror and it takes about two hours. The movie Alien stars, Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm and Yaphet Kotto.The story takes place in 2122. A spaceship travels to planet Earth, loaded with ore. There are seven people present on the spaceship which are Dallas, Ash, Kane, Parker Brett and two women. The film starts with a signal being sent out by another planet to the spaceship. The spaceship has an advanced computer on board which they call the Mother. The Mother reacts to the signal of the unknown planet after which the spaceship changes course towards the planet. The members of the spaceship land on the planet and start investigating. They find an old crashed spaceship and enter it. Firstly they find a pilot's dead body. After that, they find eggs of which one cracks. A strange organism comes out and attacks one of the spaceship members, Kane. Kane is unconscious and the other spaceship members bring him back to their own spaceship. The strange organism sucked itself to the face of Kane. The others try to get it off and the organism started to produce a certain fluid which creates holes in the spaceship. They leave the room to look at how bad the damage is, and when they come back the organism has strangely disappeared. Kane came back to conscious and cannot remember anything. They start looking for the organism and find it dead on the ground. In the evening when the group members are having dinner, Kane becomes ill and another strange organism, with a tail this time, comes out of his chest. The organism flees and the spaceship members start looking for the organism. They find its skin and it looked like it had melted. Brett finds the organism which had changed since the last time they saw it coming out of Kane's chest. It became bigger, the tail became sharp, and got very large teeth and a stabbing tongue. The creature kills Brett immediately. Dallas comes up with the idea to use a flame thrower to drive away the creature back in to space. While Dallas is on his mission, the others hear him scream, Dallas seems to have been disappeared.The transport company of the spaceship orders the members of the spaceship not to kill the creature but to catch it for investigation. Ash starts attacking Ripley when he hears about this dangerous request. Parker then attacks Ash to protect Ripley after which Ash turns out to be a robot. The rest of the spaceship members destroy him\/it, and want to leave the spaceship with the backup capsule. Before they leave, they first have to search for coolant for the shuttle and the cat they lost in the beginning. When Ripley and Jones start searching for the cat and the rest for the coolant, Ripley hears the others scream. When Ripley and Jones run towards the screaming but the others are already killed. Ripley and Jones decide to leave to the backup capsule and blow up the spaceship. When the spaceship is blown up and Jones and Ripley are in the backup capsule, they find out the creature is inside the backup capsule. Ripley succeeds in getting it out.

Eventually, after the usual round of heroic stunts, Bond finds himself squaring off against the assassin in a remote island paradise. Tom Moore's cinematography is flawless.

The elaborate car stunt with a car leaping across a gap between two bridges is spectacular. The film is bookended with scenes of 007 dueling in a carnival setting.

What a despicable premise for a movie-plot.HOOK could have only come out of the self-satisfied head of Steven Spielberg, one of America's most idiotic and over-rated directors, ever.The children portrayed in this flick actually made my skin crawl. Yes, they were that insufferable and obnoxious.According to this flick - Steven Spielberg is the self-appointed expert on rearing children. And, this joker says that mothers need only to be themselves. Yeah. That's OK. Mothers aren't required to do anything else, but, just that - Be mothers.But, on the other hand - Fathers must transcend beyond just being mere fathers. They must do cartwheels and, literally, turn into Peter Pan (just like Robin Williams did) before they can be allowed to gain acceptance from their snooty, little brats.It's the truth.

Perhaps it failed because it dared to carry the American Ninja name instead of trying to be a stand alone film. Then again maybe people only watched it because of the name!In any case, American Ninja 3 is my favourite of the series, mainly because it drops the military fetish of the previous films in favour of pure martial arts action. The acting is neither above nor below the first two films and shouldn't be a factor in this genre anyway. Where American Ninja 3 excels is the action. The fight scenes are so much better choreographed than the clumsy action of the first two films. David Bradley is obviously a real martial artist and this casting makes a tremendous difference to the choreography. Gone are the simple throws and tight camera work tailored to mask Dudikoff's lack of martial skill and now we have lots of fast wide angle fights with flashy kicks and some meaty sound effects. The 80's style and fashions of the film only help to make me smile and of course the fantastic Steve James (the real star of the show) makes a welcome return.I guess it's all down to taste. I was brought up on Eastern Martial arts films with fine choreography from an early ages so when the American market started their attempts in the 80's the fights just weren't up to scratch for me and the first two films were a disappointment in that area as well as being more A-Team than Ninja. American Ninja 3 addresses these points and gets the focus of the film (the fights) right and that's all anyone can ask for in this genre, because if you are looking for moving acting or tremendous plots you are looking in the wrong genre.Not a patch on Hong Kong films but s solid martial arts film in it's own right!
