The label read EVIL DEAD II in a faded red typeface. Being English, I had no clue what to expect, I'd never heard of the original EVIL DEAD as it had been swept up in the BBFC's roundup of so-called Video Nasties(movies deemed likely by a short-sighted and infantile board of censors to deprave & corrupt). Either way, the weekend arrived, my house filled up with friends, the tape went in&#133; and we were changed forever.EVIL DEAD II a sequel to the original EVIL DEAD &#150; the tragic tale of a group of teenagers assaulted by demonic forces while stranded in a remote cabin in the wilderness. EVIL DEAD II replayed the entirety of the first film (with several differences) in ten minutes, then brought more young folk out to the cabin to get generally mistreated by the demonic powers circling their cabin refuge like sharks at a shipwreck. Our hero is Ash, an average, slightly dumb guy who's out at the cabin with his girlfriend Linda. They find a tape recorder left by the previous tenant (a history professor working on the translation of an artefact he has discovered), and upon playing the tape release a demonic force into the woods around them. Linda gets possessed, Ash decapitates her with a shovel and then gets possessed himself (albeit temporarily). Plagued by demon-induced visions and a Linda that wont stay in buried, Ash descends into madness. Meanwhile four more victims arrive in the shape of the prof's daughter, a fellow colleague and a couple of local hicks out to make a quick buck. The circle is drawn, the demon's attacks build up in pace, and you just know it's all going to end in tears.EVIL DEAD II is like a ride on the best ghost train imaginable. It does not let up until the very end. Even the most ADHD-gripped teen can appreciate how balls-to-the-wall this movie is. Each gag is rapidly followed by another. I use the term gag as this movie, despite being filled with gore and violence, is funny. I mean fall on you ass laughing funny. Even when people are dying you have a malicious smile on your face. People get drenched in blood and goo, accidentally swallow eyeballs, get possessed and generally go mental, corpses are reanimated, trees come to life and attack and disembodied hands run amok. All the while the movie's tongue moves not an inch from its cheek. If you don't at least crack a smile at this film, you're probably dead already.Without a doubt though, this is Bruce Campbell's movie. As Ash he steals the show with bouts of world-class lunacy, crass cowardice, hammy scenery-chewing, physical comedy and occasional heroism. Ash is indeed a superhero in the making in this movie, soon after to become one of the greatest horror heroes ever. When he finally gets his act together to become the hero and dons his hero's armour I defy anyone not to think they're watching one of the coolest scenes in cinema history. Ash might be an idiot, but you'd want him at your six if demons were attacking your neighbourhood.The script is at times a bit limited and clunky, and some of the other performances are minimal. Also the effects sometimes look seriously bargain-basement. It doesn't matter in the slightest though. This is a film made with real passion, a sense of humour, and no desire to do anything that scare and delight the viewer. It's horror from a simpler age; one not afraid to be silly or gross in equal parts. It's classics like this that have cemented Sam Rami's career as a director to watch long before SPIDERMAN.

While Godard's brand of realism creates a sense of ambiguity along with a sense of discomfort in his audience (Bande a part - Band of Outsiders), Kiarostami achieves the same sense of ambiguity while taking his viewer to an uncommonly tranquil if not peaceful place! It's astonishing that this movie is ultimately about suicide and after wards one feels exhilarated! Kiarostami never even shares with us why Mr. Badii is trying to kill himself and we as the audience never feel that we need to know! I suppose that underscores Kiarostami's mastery of narrative.Kiarostami is obviously a very heavy intellectual deeply rooted in the Iranian literary tradition of the 1930-1980 period. The literature of this period produced the likes of Hedayat, Chubak and Alavi as great examples of writers who explored realism as a genre. I feel we see quite a bit of those writers in Kiarostami's movies. The hallmark of the genre is its attempt to withhold moral judgment on its characters at the expense of leaving the reader\/viewer with a deep sense of ambiguity, and Kiarostami is extremely successful at this task in his recent movies. It's all the more remarkable when we realize that Kiarostami started out as a children's film maker and in his early movies he had to communicate very clear and unambiguous messages. Even some of his well known earlier works (Traveler, 1974) were done in that tradition. But in his recent movies, while he maintains the simple, easy style of a children's movie, he has achieved the mastery of realism by leaving out any attempt to judge his characters and in so doing has achieved a state of purity that is extremely rare among his peers.If you're looking for a movie to offer a very complicated plot or one to move you to the edge of your seat, this isn't it! If you're looking for a movie that will linger in your mind and make you wonder, then this may well be it!

Faking his way through his medical he is soon back in action, charged to protect a windtalker one of the Navajo Marines who are used as code talkers to keep radio signals secret from the enemy; protect him that is, unless capture is imminent in which case Joe is to kill his charge. Put together with Private Ben Yahzee, Joe struggles to keep it together in battles where his rage drives him on, but his growing friendship with Joe threatens his entire mission.Despite the names involved with this project, nothing else about it really grabbed me when it came out at the cinema; the action just looked noisy and the story looked like it would be lost in all that. Never let it be said that you can tell nothing from the trailers because it turns out that this is exactly what the film is like. The story is interesting in terms of a very basic piece of history but, beyond the one-sentence summary, there isn't really anything to learn.

The rest of it he spends looking soft and wounded as he stops worrying and learns to love his Indian. Beach is pretty and he does make for an attractive character but the lack of depth leaves him pulling faces and jumping around just like everyone else. Considering his high-billing, Slater appeared to just walk in and out of the film as if he was required somewhere else. Stomare does nothing much but then nor do Emmerich, Ruffalo, Issacs and others who you would expect of at least being interesting.Overall this is not a poor film, it is just a very average and unmemorable one. The lack of a good character-based story (or story full stop) means that the noisy action dominates and, without any unique style, flair or real excitement to that, it does become rather tiresome after a while. Of course if this is all you are after then it is probably noisy and violent enough but you should bare in mind three things 1) there are more exciting action movies out there, 2) there are more meaningful war movies out there and, 3) there are much better John Woo films out there.

Mankind now exists within several key groups slavers, smokers, small communities and lone sailors who trade their way as they go. One such trader is the Mariner, a tough, lone man who mistrusts everyone &#150; a mistrust that is proved correct when a community spots he is also a mutant and sentences him to death. Before it can be carried out though, the Smokers attack and the Mariner is able to escape thanks to a woman and a little girl. However the little girl also happens to be the only existing map to dry land and the Mariner finds himself pursued by the Smokers.Everyone knows that the critics had buried this one before it even reached a single screen. It is rare for critics to see horrible movies &#150; few of these make it to the cinema &#150; so whenever they get the chance to write a scathing review, they tend to take it and run with it. However as the critics moved onto the bandwagons of other years, Waterworld has been left to stand for itself and be judged on its own merits. When you look at it as it actually is, the film just sits as an OK blockbuster, nothing more but certainly nothing less either. The plot is a cross between Mad Max on water and the standard tough guy coming to love little kid things that provides a plot driver and supposedly an emotional way in.

Too many lazy reviewers (professional and amateur alike) have jumped on the all at sea line when talking about the performances and, although few are that great, lazy joking is rather a critique. Costner goes for a dark hero but misses a bit and ends up just being a bit unrelatable until his predictable sea change (sorry) at the end. He is still OK but didn't help me get into the characters. Tripplehorn is basic and her character could have easily been played by anyone. Majorino is annoying of course but then she is a typical cute kid role and nothing more. Hopper at least has fun and he does add a bit of enjoyment to the film where the others are forced to treat the material a bit more seriously; the film's high points generally come when he is on screen. The rest of the cast fill the space but don't do a great deal else but then, like many blockbusters, this is not an actor's film.Overall then, critically mauled and great fun for critics of the time but in essence it is just another in a long line of average blockbuster movies. The cast aren't great, the story is so-so, the action is enjoyable and the design of it looks good (albeit a bit too much indebted to Mad Max).

Take for instance the French movie Code inconnu Récit incomplet de divers voyages. What happened there is that the writer had added so many different story lines that the entire movie just started to look messy and almost impossible to understand. Knowing that Magnolia has been written in the same way, made me doubt about the fact whether I would like it or not.Magnolia studies the lives of nine individuals, but when you look closer, you will see that the entire movie is in fact divided into two parallel stories. One story evolves around the life of game show host Jimmy Gator. He has cancer, is married and has one daughter who no longer wants to have anything to do with him, but who constantly uses cocaine. The other man is Earl Partridge, he too is dying, he's married to a much younger woman and has lost all contact with his son who has become some kind of guru who teaches men how to get as much sex as they want. Besides these two families you'll also get an insight into the live of the current and past whiz kids on Jimmy's show, the male nurse who takes care of Earl, a nice cop,... And all the time it is raining cats and dogs (and in the end more things than that). All these people have a lot more in common than they ever expected, the only question that remains is is this a coincidence or not?If I had to give a more detailed description of the story, than I would be writing for hours on this review. Does that mean that it is so complicated? No, not really, although you have to stay focused if you don't want to lose an important part of course, but complicated it is not. I would even say that Paul Thomas Anderson has avoided THE big trap he could have stepped in and which others didn't seem to see he hasn't made a mess out of it by adding too many different story lines. It's all still manageable and stays interesting thanks to the way the entire story has been merged. Even though it seems like an impossible task to start watching a movie about the lives of 9 different people, this really isn't the case. It has been written so well that you'll automatically be drawn into it (at least I was) and you'll almost certainly be touched by it. And all the surreality in the beginning and at the end, you'll just have to keep an open mind towards it I guess.Of course you can also expect a lot of good acting. People like Julianne Moore, William Macy, Jason Robards, Melora Walters all do a wonderful job in this movie, but if I have to pick one actor out of the entire cast that really astonished me, then I'll not have to think twice. Tom Cruise was absolutely brilliant as the sex guru \/ lost son. I'm sure that the role had a lot to do with his performance, but I'm also convinced that there wouldn't have been that many actors who could have done better and who would have been able to get more out of that character. This was the Tom Cruise like I would like to see him more often.Overall this is a wonderful and touching movie that has been excellently written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. I admit that I had never seen any other of his movies, but I'll definitely try to change that. I just hope I'll not be disappointed by them after seeing this masterpiece since I might start to expect too much of those movies.

I know bad movie reviews are much more fun to read, but I just can't think of any thing bad to say about it. Well, except maybe the special effects, (the elevator-on-a-string) but they did OK considering it was before CGI. It could've been worse. And everything else in it kicks ass!!! Gene Wilder rocks as Willy Wonka, constantly coming out with odd quotes\/comments\/songs at totally random moments and just generally freaking everyone out.

The original Vacation is the best, although Christmas Vacation gave it a good run for its money. Both films are incredibly dated, but it is the savage lack of restraint or political correctness in the original that makes it worth repeat viewings. 1983 was a great year for comedies that were unafraid of being labelled as being in bad taste, and director Harold Ramis had already proved his mettle on Caddyshack, one of the finest films ever made about golf. Paired with such fine actors as Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid, there was precious little that could go wrong here. When it does go wrong, the audience is too busy laughing at the other ninety nine instances where the cast and crew get it right to care. Unlike many other comedies where jokes are deleted because they didn't test well, Vacation simply leaves the failures behind and moves on to the next.The plot concerns itself with one Clark Griswold, a designer of food additives who wishes people would take him more seriously. He takes his family on a road trip across the USA, with the final destination being a theme park known as Wallyworld. Wallyworld being a cheap knock-off of Disneyland, naturally. None of the film is really rooted in reality, as the moment when the old Griswold family car is ceremoniously towed off to be crushed at the car dealership. Maybe it is meant to demonstrate how spineless a man Clark is, but even the most timid man would file complaints or sue if the vehicle he ordered turned out to not be there on the delivery date, and his old car was written off. Clark's spinelessness is a two-edged sword. It drives the comedy very effectively in some scenes, but it grates in others. As I have more or less indicated, it only works when there is no good reason for him to be more aggressive.The plot thread with Clark lusting after a babe in a Ferarri (that is more or less how she is billed) is incredibly dated nowadays. Christie Brinkley puts in a great performance as the piece of tail that this spineless wimp keeps chasing in spite of the fact that he should know this woman is so out of his league. Dana Barron and Anthony Michael Hall are great as the long-suffering Griswold children, who alternate between being amused at the misadventures on the road and reflecting on what a big wuss their father is. Observant viewers will noticed that Anthony Michael Hall grows a foot or two between the introductory sequences and the arrival at the Griswolds' destination. John Candy gets a great cameo as a security guard who seems as spineless as Clark. But it is Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Jane Krakowski, John Navin, and Imogene Coca as Ellen's relatives who make the film as funny as people remember. One almost wishes there could be a film entirely devoted to these idiots.For sure, Vacation is incredibly dated, and some of the humour in it has been lost to time. It has also spawned more sequels than any franchise this ordinary deserves. Then again, you could not have Christmas Vacation without European Vacation, so I guess we should take the good with the bad. Anthony Michael Hall has defied expectations and had a decent career since, while Dana Barron and most of the rest of the cast have seemingly dropped off the face of the Earth. Chevy Chase has basically been reduced to the B-list, making the kind of films that rarely get released on video outside of America, if at all. Fortunately, director Harold Ramis has gone onto much bigger and better things, as an actor, director, and a writer. Unfortunately, this kind of B-level comedy that used to fill the rental shelves has been phased out in favour of politically correct drivel. I guess some you win, some you lose.I gave Vacation a six out of ten. Unlike some other comedies that have this is a product of the 1980s stamped all over them, it has not aged well. It is, in fact, quite a step down from Caddyshack, Chevy Chase's previous collaboration with Harold Ramis. Still, if you are bored and could do with some nostalgia, Vacation might be worth a try.

It is this story of life growing up in a neighborhood run by a crime boss and how a mans son is almost dragged too deep into it.A Bronx Tale features Chazz Palminteri as the crime boss known as Sonny. Sonny makes Calogero (Lillo Brancato), or as he calls him 'C', his new apprentice. 's father is Lorenzo played by De Niro who doesn't like Sonny and how he runs things. He especially doesn't want his own son being involved in that kind of life. 'C' has been around Sonny since he was nine years old, shooting craps in Sonny's basement. Sonny is now 17 and learning a few tips here and there on how things work in the neighborhood. It's fear that gives Sonny respect and gives him control over the area. 'C' is also forced into some uncomfortable situations with his nitwit friends who want nothing more than to be like Sonny no matter what the cost. When a skirmish between the the nearby black community and these guys, it makes a turn for the worse when 'C' watches his friends beat up some black teenagers. To make matters worse, 'C' has a little crush on a girl at school who happens to be black. He sees nothing wrong with that, other than the fact that no one would accept them in his group.

The story told through his eyes is one that is gripping and keeps you enthralled. Palmintiri is wonderful as Sonny who at times is as kind hearted as a lamb, but then will pounce on you in a second.

I begin with my #5 choice, Secrets and Lies, a Mike Leigh drama\/comedy about the secrets and lies (shock) that tear apart a dysfunctional British family. Brenda Blethyn plays Cynthia Purley, the very dramatic and always crying single mother who is one day contacted by the daughter she gave up for adoption&#133;who happens to be black. The look on Blethyn's face is priceless as she flashes back to a one night stand she had as a young lady.Most would think Leigh's story would revolve around race relations, which is not the case at all (race is never an issue). Instead he revolves his story around the Purley family, a unit so torn apart from over the years that a simple family cook out turns into a soap opera. Secrets and lies! We're all in pain! Why can't we share our pain? I've spent my entire life trying to make people happy, and the three people I love the most in the world hate each other's guts, and I'm in the middle! I can't take it anymore! This memorable quote comes from Maurice Purley, brother to Cynthia and talented photographer. Maurice is your classic good guy, the passive patriarch who always tries to hold the family together. (The irony around his character is that he cannot conceive a child with his wife, Monica). You almost feel sorry for the successful Hortense, as if she would be better off not knowing her birth mother at all.The actors are so talented in this film that Leigh, at times, uses no cuts during a scene. The camera stays in one spot as the actors' play out scenes that can last 10-15 minutes. After you get past the difficult British dialect (you may want to use captions while watching), you will feel as if you are that nosey neighbor who can't help but listen and enjoy the problems this family confronts&#133;and that's no lie.

The look on Blethyn's face is priceless as she flashes back to a one night stand she had as a young lady.Most would think Leigh's story would revolve around race relations, which is not the case at all (race is never an issue). Instead he revolves his story around the Purley family, a unit so torn apart from over the years that a simple family cook out turns into a soap opera. Secrets and lies! We're all in pain! Why can't we share our pain? I've spent my entire life trying to make people happy, and the three people I love the most in the world hate each other's guts, and I'm in the middle! I can't take it anymore! This memorable quote comes from Maurice Purley, brother to Cynthia and talented photographer. Maurice is your classic good guy, the passive patriarch who always tries to hold the family together. (The irony around his character is that he cannot conceive a child with his wife, Monica). You almost feel sorry for the successful Hortense, as if she would be better off not knowing her birth mother at all.The actors are so talented in this film that Leigh, at times, uses no cuts during a scene. The camera stays in one spot as the actors' play out scenes that can last 10-15 minutes. After you get past the difficult British dialect (you may want to use captions while watching), you will feel as if you are that nosey neighbor who can't help but listen and enjoy the problems this family confronts&#133;and that's no lie.

Of course, in Godzilla 1985 (which is 1984 in Japan time), Godzilla returns to his old stomping grounds of Tokyo. He first attacks a fishing boat and kills everyone on-board except one, then a Soviet submarine, a nuclear reactor (which is where we see the glorious Big Guy for the first time), and finally has his eyes set on Tokyo. What hinders this film big time, especially in the American version, are the ugly Cold War-era politics that played into many of the film's changes in order to accommodate polarized audiences in the United States. Russians are portrayed as being inherently evil and the Japanese are shown as being weak and totally dependent on America. But by making America the hero in this picture, Americans are shown as being quite pigheaded and arrogant and stupid, with the exception of Raymond Burr, who also appeared in the American version of the original Godzilla (1954). (So it looks like the American producers really screwed themselves big time with this transition.) This seriously makes the movie dated and draws attention away from the stronger, more relevant issues the original Japanese screenwriters had envisioned. On the plus side, Toho created a rather terrifying and truly menacing Godzilla, whose presence is made all the more frightening by those blood-red eyes and thunderous roar of his. This Godzilla is the embodiment of true screen menace, in a return-to-form from the previous incarnation in the '70s. Even though he is the villain in this picture, one could shed a tear at the film's ending (which you wouldn't need to do if you care to watch the superior 1989 sequel Godzilla vs. Biollante). The special effects are magnificent, though dated; one of my particular favorite sequences is Godzilla's showdown with the Super X attack fighter and his attack on the nuclear reactor.I'd recommend this entry only if you're a die-hard kaiju-eiga fan; if not, you should probably skip this one and go straight to Godzilla vs. Biollante, which is my personal favorite Godzilla film from the second generation.
