Some thoughts and lots of spoilers Have you noticed that when we go to sleep we sometimes carry some of the residue of the day into our dreams with us? Just bits and pieces, usually. A little bit of everyday `reality' swept in that gets skewed and twisted in the fugue of sleep. Add to that a healthy dose of despair, and guilt and you could be on one hell of a trip. That, I think, is what we have here in the film Mulholland Drive. We start with the perspective of one climbing into bed and falling into a pillow&#133; here the dream, and the skewed reality begins. Diane, now Betty, hits L.A. straight off the jitterbug circuit where she's just won a dance contest which has prompted her to try her hand at acting (makes since, right? Jitterbug contest winner = great actress pre-req). Sounds like something straight out of a silly old fifties movie right? Coincidentally, as you find out later in the film, Diane in an extra on the set of a movie set in the fifties.  In Diane's dream, Betty hasn't got a care in the world. Everyone is so nice to her and her situation couldn't be more perfect; Her aunt is conveniently away and has left Betty her fantastic apartment. The aunt has also got Hollywood connections and has arranged for Betty to go in for an audition, her first ever, and of course, they love her (with all her jitterbug experience how could she fail?). She's just perfect for the part. She's not had to suffer the pain of rejection. Rejection and failure, those elements seem to me major players in this picture and missing thus far in the film. It seems it's at this point that reality first tries to creep into her dream. The pain of not getting a part in reality is glossed over in the dream by some strange characters making the director cast some unwanted for the part. We are also now taken on some side venues that, to me, are just remnants of the real world that Diane has drug into her dream but are, in the end, inconsequential. Now comes the unavoidable part&#133; Rita (Camilla in the real world), Diane's love interest. There's no way around casting her in the dream. She's been Diane's focus for far too long for that.  In this role, Rita is the beautiful, sole survivor of a horrible car accident who conveniently has amnesia so she can be anyone Betty's mind needs her to be, except for the person she really is, of course. Here, Rita is dependent on Betty, she needs Betty. Just the way Diane would love to have been needed by Rita.   In the real world Diane is all messed up. She wants to live the Hollywood dream but, the reality is that she's not a star and probably never will be. She's infatuated with a woman, Camilla,  who is a star but is no longer interested in Diane. Her obsession's new romance with the director of the film that both women are working on is rubbed in Diane's face and she snaps. Have you ever noticed how that when something bad is going to happen, something you were dreading but powerless to stop, it seems to occur with agonizing slowness when it does finally happen? The point where the director announces the impending nuptials between himself and Diane's intended, plays just like the eponymous scenario. During this scene we see the cowboy walk by who will be pulled into the dreams later simply because of his presence during this powerful turn\/crack in Diane's mind. Diane goes off the deep end and hires someone to kill Camilla. The agony of loosing Camilla and the guilt of having her killed is too much for Diane. She sleeps all day, trying to escape the reality. For the brief time we do see her in the real world is when she is awakened by her neighbor, collecting some things left behind after the two swapped apartments. Diane is in her robe, hair a mess looking like she's been in bed for days. (Anyone who has been or knows someone that's been depressed, knows this is probably the case). The neighbor informs Diane that some detectives came looking for her again. Undoubtedly investigating Rita's disappearance\/death. One of the last times we see Diane, is her standing in her kitchen thinking back on the things that led to this point. To the point where guilt and despair cause her to take her own life. The next time we see her in reality is when the demons have come home and she has to shut them out for good&#133;      As far as the homeless guy in the back of Winkie's goes (note the name denotes sleep catch a few winks &#150; Winkie's, Ok maybe not) to me he could represent the dirty little secret in the back of Diane's mind. She did, after all, hire someone to kill Rita. The blue box might represent Diane's life; she has the key but never opens it herself. Once it is opened by Rita, we see that it is empty. Rita is the one that holds it in her hands and opens it up. In the end though, it's dropped by Rita and we see them no more. As far as the old couple&#133; that could be the finger of accusation. The innocent and honest seem to magnify guilt and shame just by their very existence. To me the strangest thing in this movie is the aunt walking into the room after Rita drops the box&#133; as though she heard it drop. Did she feel a disturbance in the force? Did she somehow feel Diane's life pass. We don't even know if she really is Diane's aunt or just another inane character having been dragged into Diane's dream. Whatever the case, this movie will keep you guessing and asking questions long after it's viewed. In my opinion this is one of Lynch's best.

A famous Hollywood actress (Harring) is about to be killed by two thugs when the car they're in is smashed to smithereens in a freak accident.  Everyone is killed, except her, and she walks off dazed into the night.  Suffering from amnesia, she winds up taking refuge in a house, only to be discovered by a hopeful young actress (Watts) who's housesitting the place for her aunt.  Together they attempt to find out who she is, and their journey takes them through the dream-like underworld of LA.  A subplot involving a director (Theroux) getting into trouble with some gangsters over the lead actress in his latest movie is brilliantly wound into the narrative.  It all leads up to an emotionally shattering and cerebral finale, reminiscent of Lynch's debut feature, Eraserhead. Lush, dreamy photography, tricky editing and an unbelievably complex and multi-layered script (by Lynch) come together to create a unique cinematic experience.  Performances are top notch, though Naomi Watts is a standout; Dan Hedaya and Robert Forster, though prominently featured in the opening credits, have less than five minutes of screen time between them, which has become an odd Lynch trademark  (e.g. Crispin Glover in Wild at Heart; Jurgen Prochnow and David Bowie in Twin Peaks--Fire Walk With Me).  Lynch himself supposedly appears somewhere in the film; sharp eyed viewers theorize he is the unrecognizable homeless man behind Winkies.  Many viewers found this movie frustrating (I trust they are the same ones who are under the delusion that LOST HIGHWAY and ERASERHEAD don't make sense).  The key to reading Lynch's more non-linear movies is to first realize that they're central theme is simple (though, I'm well aware how open to interpretation his movies are, so someone else may take a whole other spin on them).  ERASERHEAD is about society's irrational, repressed fear of sex and sexuality.  TWIN PEAKS FIRE WALK WITH ME is about the destructive trait of child abuse.  LOST HIGHWAY is about a person's inability to escape paying for the consequences of their actions.MULHOLLAND DR. is about a soul who's dismal, heart-breaking reality is escaped only by dreaming about what could have been, and the crushing return to real life which brings about her ultimate suicide.  Look at it this way.  The first three quarters of the movie are a dream.  The last quarter is reality, remembered in quick bursts, and not necessarily in chronological order.

The same goes for Hollywood, a town full of broken dreams, shattered lives, betrayal and desertion.  That is what MULHOLLAND DR. is about.MULHOLLAND DR. is a brilliant movie.  I'm sure it would have made a fine series, but I'm glad the plug was pulled, because it led to Lynch creating his masterpiece.  Just watch it, don't fight it.  Don't try to figure it out at the expense of experiencing the movie.   Most movies are allegorical to a certain extent.  Lynch's movies are simply more so than most.  He doesn't spoon feed his audiences.  He hands you a puzzle, and gives you all the information needed to solve it, but leaves it to you to put the pieces together.  In other words, he assumes you're intelligent, patient and imaginative, and will come up with an interpretation of the movie.  It may not be his, but it IS yours.  THAT's the point.

I haven't seen much of his other stuff, however (I've seen *The Fly* and *Crash*, but I was unable to give either of them my full attention at the time, and one or two of his acting gigs, if these count), and thus came into this with relatively few expectations or preconceptions.The verdict I was entirely unimpressed with eXistenZ. It came across as uninspired, tedious, unremarkable. I remember it as a generic, monotonous little B-grade sci-fi picture with nothing much to recommend it.Now I like to think I have more than a little affinity for odd little films meant to make you think.

Whilst their are certainly fans of the book who have complaints about the movie, their are at least an equal number who loved it. And for this the film deserves every best picture award going.The movie is breathtaking. I am not one for mindless action flicks, but I can appreciate the power of sheer cinematic spectacle, and Jackson manages to tread a fine line and displays talent for making the spectacular significant. The stunning landscapes and meticulous attention to detail create a beautiful depiction of Middle Earth. It is notoriously difficult to portray the characters of a well loved book in a visual art form, and there will certainly be some quibbles over the appearance of certain characters. I felt however that the film succeeded where all the drawings I have seen failed - it brought to life Gandalf, Aragorn, Frodo and the rest just as I imagined them. The performances were brilliant. McKellen's Gandalf is the perfect balance between a gruff yet caring old man, and a powerful and noble wizard. Indeed, the delicate balance of the double natures which are so much a part of the novel were well handled by all. The elves, sorrowful and joyful, majestic yet kind, at once old and young, were uniformly well portrayed, with particular mention deserved by Blanchett and Weaving. I have heard comments that Mortenson was wooden, but I felt that his quiet and subtle portrayal perfectly suited the character of a man of noble birth under the guise of a ranger. Mortenson's measured, thoughtful portrayal added depth to a character who in the novel, due to Tolkien's use of the mythological genre, is almost underdeveloped.The changes mad to the original text may cause concern for some, but in my opinion they were all in the true spirit of the book, and the fact that so much of the material was sourced from the Appendix is testament to the dedication to the text felt by all involved. Kudos to the screenwriters for being brave enough to write a true adaptation, rather than attempt to put Tolkien's long sections of narrative exposition on screen, which would not have made for an interesting movie. Tolkien wrote as if he were really translating ancient texts, giving extensive notes on translation of the languages, and the power of his work is such that he has created a whole mythology, one which we can believe has an independant existence. Thus, as with the King Arthur stories, it seems acceptable to consider the movie plot not a miss representation of a book, but of a slightly different version of a legend.

When I finished watching the film I sat in a blank stare for at least 20 minutes. It was one of the most unique movies I have ever seen.  It was so real.  I don't know why it got the rating it did.  I mean it's people are afraid to have a little dose of reality smacked in their face, like they don't want to even think about facing the truth.  The script was excellent, but what impressed me most was the acting.  The performances of Paul Franklin Dano and Brian Cox took my breath away.  Some of Paul's best acting in the film was when he didn't speak.  By just looking into his eyes you could tell there was hurt and pain that he was very afraid to let out.  I  often forgot that I am watching a movie when I watched Paul.  I want to give him a pat on the back for choosing such a difficult, challenging and powerful role.  He did an absolutely breath-taking job!  Brian was very convincing in his role as Big John, he made scenes creepy when they weren't meant to be.  I enjoyed how this movie didn't sugar-coat anything, and gave you the honest truth. The only complaint I have about this film is the editing, it's very choppy. For example, you can tell they used 5 different takes to create scene. ( it's not choppy all the way through though ) This movie truly does take you straight into the mind of a teenager.  Your eyes will be glued to the screen from beginning to end.  There are a couple of uncomfortable scenes where you find your hand slowly rising, to cover your dropped jaw.  If you are a bit squeamish or are offended by a bit of cursing then this film isn't strongly recommended.  But over all I think it would a good film for teens my age and up to few, because most teen who do view this amazing film would probably feel as though they're watching themselves on screen.  This film is utterly moving and memorable.  All though it isn't necessarily a fell-good film, it will impress you beyond belief.  A Must See!!!

I don`t know if I`m reading too much into the script here but there`s something very sleazy about this sister\/brother relationship , it almost has incestious overtones . Slightly disgusting and it`s not heped by the fact that Gina Philips and Justin Long play their roles in much he same manner as Christina Applegate and David Faustino played Kelly and BudHappily however this is all forgotten as the script descends into grade Z territory . Normally this would have ruined a potentially good story but if it keeps my mind away from the creepy relationship between Trish and Darry then this is possibly a good thing . Sorry I`m lying because this script insults its audience like no other movie I`ve ever seen . Let`s see now1 ) A monster demon drives around in a truck . Think about that for a moment. A big bloody monster demon drives around in a truck and no one notices . Did the monster order it through the mail ? I thought perhaps a salesman would have noticed he`s sold a truck to a monster at the showroom . And wouldn`t someone with a truck - monster or otherwise -have to stop at a gas station to get it serviced and filled with gas ?

How come the police haven`t had any reports of missing persons ?5 ) The monster is after Darry so come the monster waits until the end of the film to snatch him when he`s had plenty of opportunity to do so before ?So you see this is a really poor script ( The directing isn`t much better by the way ) lacking in internal continuity , logic and intelligence . There are one or two scenes with potential but they have been totally ripped off from DUEL , THE TERMINATOR and the works of Clive Barker .

The camera-work and Steve Poster's cinematography are absolutely first rate and I loved the use of the slow-motion and fast forward sequences.

Donnie Darko is surely one of the most intriguing central characters in recent years. All the cast are first rate, and relative newcomer Jena Malone is beautiful as Donnie's girlfriend.

But the movie is more than two hours long, and I used SP speed to tape it...so right after Kreese says, sweep the leg, and Daniel's knee is apparently crushed, the tape ends, with Daniel crumpled on the floor in a heap, gasping for life.  It's GREAT. ","genre":"Action, Drama, Family"},{"date":"9 June 2003","score":"","review":"  SOME SPOILERS AS WELLBefore I delve into my opinion, here's a little background... I've never read any of Tolkien's books. Heck, when I first saw the preview for LOTR in the theatre, I remember thinking, Well, that movie's gonna bomb, what the hell is that about?! I didn't even know the book existed. And no, I'm not a moron. I'm a 22-year old college graduate who read all the mandatory books in advanced English in high school and so on. I didn't see the first 2 movies in the theatre, and over the past 2 years, have picked up on the story on Tolkien's vision and the scope of the films and knew I owed them and myself to try them as a movie buff.That being said, I can not and will not compare them to the book(s) (Is it just 1 big book split into a trilogy, or 3 separate books?). I can only critique the 1st LOTR as a stand-alone movie.I got to say, after watching the movie, seeing the extra documentaries on the accompanying DVD, reading many reviews and seeing what some of the hard core experts have to say on here, I can't see why this movie is rated The #4 Movie Of All-Time on this great website.The scope of the film is phenomenal. I love the fact they filmed all 3 right in a row. The detail of the costumes, the sets, the actors -- the word amazing doens't do it enough justice.But I don't know anything about these books, or other books Tolkien wrote so people know backgrounds and histories of people. I'm talking about watching The Fellowship of the Ring as a stand alone work of art, as it should be. Therefore, I believe it is a flawed movie, simple as that.Consider me a case study becasue I knew NOTHING heading into the movie about the trilogy or the past stories of the characters. So, saying that again, I'll tell you what I got out of this movie.1. Awe-inspiring detail\/imagery\/cinemetography. It would make George Lucas soil his shorts. No doubt he's working hard right now trying to raise the bar for his Star Wars Episode 3.2. Flimsy characters. Again, before the die-hards flip out on me. I can only go with what's shown on the screen. And in 3 hours of what is basically an extended chase-movie, I can sum up the main characters in quick phrases. Frodo; troubled Hobbit who bears a great burden. 2 other token Hobbits to add comedic breaks in the film. Viggo Mortenson's character had some depth because you could tell he was flawed (being a human) but his power\/bravery\/values etc showed. Then the other human = a caricature of how humans can go wrong (power-hungry). The Dwarf who's a stubborn fighter.3. How can the writers expect anyone to feel any pull towards the romantic part of the movie (the 2 minutes with Liv Tyler and Viggo) when we see no back story, no nothing? They hold hands a minute and she says she wants to marry him and not live eternally, that's what we got to go on? I felt nothing there.4. Gandolf was played awesomely. He deserved that Best Actor nod.5. I'm not saying the movie is cliche'd. I know that it's a trilogy so I'm not complaining about the lack of an ending. But somethings are just too much. The movie is like an extended get-away. I was left thinking at the introduction of every setting, What are they going to dodge next? And Gandolf is hanging by a thread on the stone bridge... Earlier in the film we see him throwing a fellow Wizard scross the room... dude, just float up! Am I wrong? These people of Middle Earth have access to fireworks that would make any 4th of July celebration on your block look ridiculous, and the best weapons they can come up with are axes, swords and bow and arrows?The people of Mordor have access to some kind of power which allowed the Original Bad Dude (sorry, I forgot his name) to create this all powerful Ring to rule all others, am I right? What do they do? They make these Super-Orcs. Viggo was taking them down 3 at a time, and he's supposed to be the fallable human?!6. The bad guys on the black horses can sense instantly when Frodo puts on the ring.. So in the 50 years Biffo or the 111-year-old Hobbit had it, he NEVER put it on? If they were so hell bent on getting it back, what took them so long once it was taken from Gollum?Somebody else mentioned that they felt like a spectator of the events on screen, kind of disconnected, and I really agree. That may be because I never read the books, but it shouldn't be that way. The film should be able to stand on its own.I know this post may bother some of the hardcore fans who grew up with the book and love the films. But it's how I feel and I think it's obvious. I may be missing the boat here. I know of people who just don't get Star Wars and I really enjoy those movies. Don't get me wrong, this is more than a movie - it's an achievement of film. I have the utmost respect for Tolkien's vision (as a child, I drew up maps and things, dreaming of unknown worlds, but this guy is amazing... inventing 14 languages?!) and the actors and P.Jackson's dedication.But I just don't believe that this movie can contend for the title as one of the best movies of all-time, I'm sorry.
