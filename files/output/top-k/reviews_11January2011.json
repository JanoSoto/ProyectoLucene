The history of this country can be compared to a deep wound that still can't be healed up. The land has been tortured, invaded, raped in her soul by the circumstances of History, it's still bleeding yet people never stopped to sing, to dance, to love, to believe in a brighter future. Such a personal story, so deeply rooted in Kusturica's heart, could have been told in a sad, dark and quite depressing tone, but a sad movie, Underground is not. And a hilarious imaginative poignant comedy, it sure is. Emir Kusturica's Golden Palm Winner is a masterpiece of flamboyance, of decadence and non-stop dance ... a never-ending party that revisits the tragedy of History and translates it into an epic, romantic and frenetic comedy, so damn entertaining these isn't a single moment I didn't want to get up on the table and start to dance with a glass on my hand, to Goran Bergovic's incredible soundtrack. Indeed, this film is full of music, of energy, of emotions and transports us into a fantastic journey in the tragic History of Yugoslavia, following a chronological road  World War II, the Cold War and of course, the Modern War. This final act is depicted in a darker tone, to highlight the loss of every thing that made Yugoslavia, a land of hope, of optimism and fraternity. But, never letting war and death pushing our mood down, Kusturica ends the film in an apotheosis. A great finale for a great movie about life and hope, to keep a great smile in your face until the end ... which the film doesn't have, because there's less optimism with an ending than with the belief of a rebirth after the mutilation of a never-ending war.But Underground isn't a documentary about this war, or about Yugoslavia. Basically, it's the story of a love triangle and an evil scheme. It starts with two men, two friends  Marko, the sympathetic opportunistic intellectual and his best friend Blacky who's just joined the Party, Blacky is an electrician, a lovable naive buffoon with a warm heart and a head made of stone. Marko and Blacky are both members of the Communist Party and resistant fighters after the partial destruction of the country by the German invasion. Those men love to drink, to dance, and more than that, they love the same woman  the actress Natalja. Natalja is a young, pretty, ambitious woman with many lovers, a Nazi officer, Blacky, her future husband and Marko her future lover. They're all flawed, exuberant, yet always sympathetic. But the lyric soul of the film is Yvan, Marko's brother, an innocent zoo guardian with a stammer and who developed a strange relationship with a monkey, Soni. He loves his brother, he's sweet and tender, and maybe he believes in animals more than men whose cruelty touched him deep in the heart. He seems to be the only who cares for what happens and carries the tragedy in his pure heart.After liberating Blacky from the Germans, Marko hides him in the cave, underground, until the war stops ... Then Marko, who's been previously struck by Natalja's beauty will elaborate one of the most evil schemes ever plotted in film, just to keep her. He'll make all the population who lived, who were born and grew up in the cave, participate to the War Effort by making weapons for the Resistance ... even after the Liberation when the Allies achieved to destroy what the Germans left. Ivan, hidden in the cave, doesn't know the War is over. Blacky doesn't know the Iron Curtrain is drawn now and he's a dead legend above the ground. He doesn't even know that his best friend, is very close to Tito, and a respectable member of the Party, married to Natalja, an acclaimed actress.Natalja drowns her guilt and her loss of innocence in alcohol, she's weak but she's already been ... Natalja is a beautiful girl flirting with the enemy, married to a man, and having a love affair with another. She and Marko are both opportunistic, they understand each other. She can't hate him because he lies so well. It's not her fault, she can't control her seductive power. Natalja is like an allegory of a beautiful country invaded numerous times during history, a country that doesn't know where her heart belongs anymore. Blacky and the poor victims of Comrade Marko lived in a cave during the Communism years, did they really miss more than those who lived above the ground ? The scheme is so evil Marko has an accomplice who found a trick to make time go slower, like life in an oppressive time make it seem slower. A diabolical absurd scheme, but no more or no less than the reality ... what better alibi for absurdity than war? Hot or Cold? War is ABSURD enough to inspire such acts ... The story is simply a fascinating metaphor of the more serious tragic fate of Kusturica's bruised motherland.But despite this sadness, the movie is about hope, joy and optimism ... these are the happiest and most cheerful people you'll see in a film, even during War, even when they fight, even in a cave, living years and years without seeing the sunlight, don't prevent them from amusement, dances, laughs, plays and everything that makes life worth to live ... the movie is a big Prison you never want to escape from. It's thrilling to watch, it's an optimistic tale for a tragic story ... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh and laugh and shout and fight and dance and have an extraordinary cinematic experience ....So, comrades, just have a glass and join the party ...

The local festive parade gets some national media coverage & Samantha is featured on telly, while driving home one night Samantha hits a Deer & crashes her car knocking herself out. When Samantha comes round in hospital something is different, her personality is different from the mild mannered school teacher that she had been for the previous eight years after waking up pregnant on a beach with total amnesia. Having hired many private detectives to try & find out about her previous life Samantha has all but given up but former Atlanta cop Mitch Henessy (Samuel L. Jackson) has a solid lead on Samantha's forgotten past which turns deadly when Samatha discovers she was a elite assassin for the US Government named Charly Baltimore who a lot of people now want dead...Produced & directed by Renny Harlin & starring his then Oscar winning wife Geena Davis & I remember at the time it was released theatrically that The Long Kiss Goodnight was largely panned & I can distinctly remember someone I knew going to the cinema to see it & then simply saying it was 'crap' after, while not crap I didn't think The Long Kiss Goodnight was anything special but it does pass the time & does entertain in a mindless action sort of way. While watching The Long Kiss Goodnight it was very apparent that the script tries a role reversal & switches things over from your typical macho action film in that it has the main female character as the strong almost invincible lead & the main male character the weak one who needs rescuing, in simpler terms The Long Kiss Goodnight felt like a violent James Bond film with the Bond & his love interest roles reversed. Samantha turns out to be a spy as well, another little James Bond parallel if you like. At an hour & fifty minutes long The Long Kiss Goodnight lasts a while & I suppose there's enough action to keep one entertained & stop the boredom creeping in, from numerous shoot-outs to fights to large explosions. Having said that there's plenty of silly scripting, the brakes on the big truck at the end just happen to fail, bad guy's guns just happen to run out of ammo, huge explosions not injuring Samantha despite going off right next to her, everything Samantha needs to make a daring escape from life threatening situations are conveniently at hand & the action film cliché where Samatha comes up against several bad guy's with guns all shooting at her yet never hit her & she manages to kill each one with a single bullet, yawn. The Long Kiss Goodnight feels like the ultimate female empowerment film, from a sedate school teaching baking cakes to an unstoppable super assassin Samantha undergoes quite a transformation although the script is ambiguous & a bit muddled as to which it wants to sympathise with. The motivation for the bad guy's is also a little underwhelming, so this guy wants to kill thousands of people so he can get funding of the US Government & hires an entire army of (seemingly useless) men to carry out his plan?The action scenes felt a little routine to me, the usual shoot-outs where the bad guy's can't shoot straight & are taken out far too easily but there are one or two good moments including a brilliant & spectacular exploding bridge at the end. The stunts are very good but some of the early CGI computer effects work is a little poor & looks out of place. Like most action films from the late 80's & early 90's there's a strong buddy buddy element here with the two mismatched leads slowly growing a definite friendship as the film progresses, the banter & chemistry between Geena Davis & Samuel L. Jackson is alright & some of the dialogue & one-liners are OK but nothing that special & nothing particularly quotable. One other notable aspect is that The Long Kiss Goodnight is very violent with a high body count as bad guy's are stabbed, shot, burned & blown up left, right & center. Another aspect that reminded of the James Bond films were the scenes in which the bad guy's have ample opportunity to just kill Samantha but decide to dispose of her by means of an elaborate trap & not stick around to see the outcome. Sloppy.With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 it flopped at the box-office taking less than $10,000,000 during it's opening weekend. Filmed mainly in Ontario in Canada & featuring the impressive Niagra Falls where the final explosive set-piece takes place. Very well made with nice cinematography The Long Kiss Goodnight has a festive feel with all the snow everywhere. The acting is pretty good, Davis & Jackson are good while the rest of the cast do decent enough jobs.The Long Kiss Goodnight is a decent enough action thriller, I suppose it was quite revolutionary in having the female as the strong hero & the male in a lesser role but that still doesn't mean it's brilliant, it passes a couple of hours painlessly enough & there are some good action scenes including a spectacular explosion at the end. Worth watching for sure but just lacks that little something that lifts an average film into a great one.

Another aspect that reminded of the James Bond films were the scenes in which the bad guy's have ample opportunity to just kill Samantha but decide to dispose of her by means of an elaborate trap & not stick around to see the outcome. Sloppy.With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 it flopped at the box-office taking less than $10,000,000 during it's opening weekend. Filmed mainly in Ontario in Canada & featuring the impressive Niagra Falls where the final explosive set-piece takes place. Very well made with nice cinematography The Long Kiss Goodnight has a festive feel with all the snow everywhere. The acting is pretty good, Davis & Jackson are good while the rest of the cast do decent enough jobs.The Long Kiss Goodnight is a decent enough action thriller, I suppose it was quite revolutionary in having the female as the strong hero & the male in a lesser role but that still doesn't mean it's brilliant, it passes a couple of hours painlessly enough & there are some good action scenes including a spectacular explosion at the end. Worth watching for sure but just lacks that little something that lifts an average film into a great one.

I snuck a viewing of it fairly young, too young to fully understand the traps and pleasures sex could bring to someone inexperienced, yet inquisitive and vulnerable enough(as teenagers often are). Tom Cruise was the epitome of cool to me as a kid. I wanted to have that presence, that look, to wear Ray bans and carry myself with that kind of confidence. I wanted to have that kind of charisma, star wattage, to appear on screen and smile with all the charm to melt the hearts of practically any girl. The film itself, rises beyond just Cruise's star power, his young man really has a lot of pressure put on him. He wants so desperately to appease his wealthy parents who trust him but demand much out of him. He's given the keys to the castle so to speak, the parents leaving him all alone while they go on a momentary vacation at his aunt's. The Tangerine Dream score equates the already striking allure of the film's subject matter. Rebecca DeMornay was a vision of the perfect fantasy danger girl, a sultry, seductive prostitute who enters into Cruise's life and turns it upside down and inside out. He is just a boy before meeting her and after their two days together, he becomes a man. I think many will consider the results of the various crises which accompany his time with DeMornay rather preposterous or unrealistic, the way he somehow manages to escape certain doom(maybe this is a bit over the top, if anything his parents would've grounded him or punished him in some unsevere way). But from the perspective of a teenager, to let your parents down through nefarious behavior would be the ultimate horror..we build these terrifying scenarios of what they will do to us, but it's never as awful as we would be led to believe. Anyway, getting involved with a prostitute and finding yourself caught between her and a pimp, Cruise finds himself knee-deep in a situation he shouldn't have been in to start with. It really starts with a phone call, not being able to pay the girl after she provides you with great service, a stolen diamond egg that belongs to Cruise's mother, becoming a for-one-night-only pimp, accidentally sinking your dad's porche in the river, missing an important test, allowing your Princeton representative to see your nightly activity as a businessman, and losing all of your parents' personal belongings and furniture because you took girls away from Guido(an excellent Joe Pantoliano, rather intimidating despite his size and receding hairline). It's casting that makes this film purr--DeMornay as quite the sex kitten, Masur as Rutherford, the man who can make or break Cruise(he is a friend of Cruise's father and agrees to meet with the young man over going to Princeton), Bronson Pinchot and Curtis Armstrong as Cruise's buds(Pinchot is Cruise's partner in a business project for class and Armstrong is the one who gets Cruise in the whole mess by calling a transvestite hooker from a sex ad), and Nicholas Pryor and Janet Carroll as Cruise's suburban parents who expect much from their son regarding his future. The love on the train scene still smokes and the first sex scene between Cruise and DeMornay is really steamy(they just have that chemistry because both are beautiful people). It's that aspect about this woman who represents everything a teenage boy of 18 considers attractive and hard to resist, she looks at you with her eyes and moves across a room with little effort and it's instant and immediate awe. It's a tightrope you are willing to walk across because she casts her wicked spell and there's no turning back--you are hooked, line and sinker. DeMornay was the epitome of what I desired and longed for as a teenager..perhaps she wasn't the one you'd marry or have a long term relationship with, but she is the woman you can't get off your mind, staring at the ceiling imagining what it'd be like to grope every part of her body, ever so slowly.

It is an excellent classic film that became the first X rated film to ever win best picture at the Academy Awards. And deservedly so. It follows the story of Joe Buck, a man from Texas who moves to New York to sell himself as a male prostitute. He slowly befriends the sickly and feeble Ratso who, for a time, acts as his manager if that's what you want to call it. It's a harrowing struggle for survival on the fast moving urban streets of New York, and Joe and Ratso learn this the hard way as they struggle to make money and find themselves in all sorts of tight spots, some profane and others euphoric. Whatever preconceptions you have about a film called Midnight Cowboy are probably wrong and you really just have to see this film for yourself to understand what its all about.Midnight Cowboy can be an uncomfortable film to watch but, to me at least, that makes it all the more memorable. It takes a lot of risks with its sexual content, especially for a film made in 1969. But it is all in good taste and all used to artistic effect. The film utilizes a great combination of aesthetics and storyline. I was very surprised at the visual quality of this film and all the aesthetic nuances it uses throughout. The film is very surreal at times and will take you on a very strange and enigmatic mind trip. Scenes will, practically without warning, morph into surreal acid trips that will stun and mystify. John Schlesinger really put forth a lot of effort to piece together meticulous scenes of surreal beauty and keep them appropriate within the context of the film. A lot of these bizarre scenes caught me off guard but made for some of the most visually fascinating moments of the whole film.The film isn't all aesthetic glam however. It is fueled primarily by a very strong story with two captivating main characters. The film will mislead you into thinking it will be a straightforward archetypal western, but then becomes a harrowing urban drama. It tells a dark but unique story that doesn't unfold like you would expect. And the story is powered by two very different but very well constructed characters. They are both multi-layered and well rounded. Both have their flaws but both elicit empathy, from me at least. And of course Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman do a great job in their roles as well. Jon Voight warps the perception of the cowboy hero in the most unorthodox and unconventional ways. He isn't necessarily set up as an anti-hero but instead just misguided. His moral compass is very off, and yet you can only really feel sorry for him and his naivety. Dustin Hoffman's performance as Ratso is alright, but it is undoubtedly dedicated and sincere. The ability of his acting may not be top notch in this film, but it is very apparent that he put his heart and soul into this performance and was, for the most part, believable.Midnight Cowboy isn't your average film, and that is what makes it such a classic. It intricately combines visual flare and a three dimensional storyline to make it a unique experience that encompasses what good filmmaking is all about. It's bizarre transitions from real to surreal make it an enticing watch. It is a very high quality film that can't easily be forgotten.

I never saw the ending coming, but maybe I should have, because even before reaching the half mark past I had already noticed something odd about it. And I had come to the conclusion that for the first time maybe I was able to resume a film in one simple word disconnection; that TSS was a faintly veiled parable on the paradox that, as humans become more and more communicated by Internet, I-pods, cellulars, etc, they become more disconnected from each other. Of course I noticed that nothing was being shown or detailed about the drifting away of Malcolm & Anna and also the unusual thing that, up to that point there had been no verbal exchange whatsoever between Crowe & Lynn, even when their lives had come to revolve around the same person; but I assumed that such a thing was being done precisely to emphasize the point. And as I didn't know a single thing about TSS beforehand--nobody warned me about the twist--I was caught pants down. But it was better that way at the end, as I got in the chin the whole emotional effect of the final revelation and for that I thank Mr. Shyamalan.But he cheated. What really threw me off was what Lynn says when Cole arrives home--You got one hour--which I assumed was being said to Crowe, as she even glances in his direction&#x97;as Anna does in the resto, after signing the check! Anyway, it found the film greatly entertaining. Superb acting work from the leads--I never imagined Die Hard Willis capable of displaying such subtlety and such wide range of emotions and that he could be able to do it in such understated, low key fashion. As for Collete, she made me remember once again her Muriel--and forget her participation in that LMS crap fest. And Williams is sublimely somber as the lonely, grieving wife. But the true star here is HJO. Superb cinematography also and a musical score up to task, conveying all the sadness and melancholy of the story in its notes, as if telling us the outcome in advance, drop by drop.With all that out of the way I'll refer now to a criticism I see in many reviews, on how unlikely is that Malcolm could have gone months without realizing he was dead. A true story Years ago I was studying Autocad in some institute in which I came to live something like an episode out of Ghost Whisperer with noises coming from nowhere, sudden changes in Temp., the whole package. Just by coincidence(!) I came to make friends then with a female classmate who told me that she could see the dead and that the one doing the racket was a poor guy who had been shot dead in the place years before. Now, you may believe this or not--I don't care--as all I want is to explain how TSS is right on the money concerning the way ghosts behave--according to people supposedly on the loop, as this woman said she was.The initiate--let's call them that way--say that those who have sudden, traumatic deaths, fall in a state of great confusion; they feel lost and disconnected. But most of all, they stay utterly convinced they are still alive and this is a situation that may last decades for them. They're able to see people ignoring them, also that they cannot hold, push, material objects but for some strange reason that is not enough to make them realize the truth. In that regard Malcolm's behaviour is typical, a textbook ex. of how the ghost of someone who was shot dead could act&#x97;Shyamalan knew exactly what was he talking about when writing the script; which is logical after all, considering his cultural and spiritual background. They also say that these ghosts don't keep a regular, flat line degree of materiality, but one that fluctuates; they may go from thin air physicality--so to speak--to almost being material human beings, i.e. with bodies (those who saw King's The Shinning could see this happening at the film's climax). It's only when they achieve extreme body consistency that they may actually do physical things--to knock on walls, open doors or throw rocks at windows, as Malcolm does. They don't feel physical needs but that doesn't seem to give them any clue. They also fade away from time to time, which makes even possible that the only conscious moments Malcolm experiences are those we see him on screen (!).Back to TSS After a first viewing I concluded that once the shock of it wears off the movie will be easily forgotten. But watching it for a second time I realized that, even knowing the ending it still makes for a superb film, that there's a lot more to it. I realized that I may have been right in my first appraisal, that this could become a classic as a parable of human isolation and alienation overcome by moral strength and solidarity (see how Cole is crowned king after he starts helping people!). 9\/10.

I never saw the ending coming, but maybe I should have, because even before reaching the half mark past I had already noticed something odd about it. And I had come to the conclusion that for the first time maybe I was able to resume a film in one simple word disconnection; that TSS was a faintly veiled parable on the paradox that, as humans become more and more communicated by Internet, I-pods, cellulars, etc, they become more disconnected from each other. Of course I noticed that nothing was being shown or detailed about the drifting away of Malcolm & Anna and also the unusual thing that, up to that point there had been no verbal exchange whatsoever between Crowe & Lynn, even when their lives had come to revolve around the same person; but I assumed that such a thing was being done precisely to emphasize the point. And as I didn't know a single thing about TSS beforehand--nobody warned me about the twist--I was caught pants down. But it was better that way at the end, as I got in the chin the whole emotional effect of the final revelation and for that I thank Mr. Shyamalan.But he cheated. What really threw me off was what Lynn says when Cole arrives home--You got one hour--which I assumed was being said to Crowe, as she even glances in his direction&#x97;as Anna does in the resto, after signing the check!

Director Roman Polanski and screen writer Robert Towne give audiences a masterpiece of both drama and suspense from the wondering viewpoint of Nicholson's character Gittes, a man who's profession is to find the truth, although the truth might be more than what he'd hoped to discover. Having a dark history in La's Chinatown, Gittie makes his honest living by exploiting the dark secrets few people want out. The secrets usually are born from either rumors or suspicions of affairs. A mysterious women claiming to be Hollis Mularay's wife, Evelyn hires Jake to scoop out the truth and find out if there really is someone else. Jake would've probably thought of old Hollis to be the most fascinating tail he's ever tracked in years, following him to public meetings, beaches, and even a mistress that finishes it all. Hollis is no ordinary guy, being the partner of Noah Cross (Houston), Evelyn's crafty and suspicious father, in the LA water and power department. It doesn't really matter to Jake, all that matters is his objective, and the sweet payday received for his work. His work results in more than just a simple check, but the consequences of widespread publicity, attracting the attention of the real, and truly more sophisticated Evelyn Mulray (Dunaway), who feels both insulted and obliged for the matter to be taken care of courtroom style. It's to Jakes luck and Evelyn's misfortune that he never sees the sight of judge, at the cost of Hollis's life though. The very sight of his body being dragged from a water reservoir, with salt water in his lungs is enough for the cops to call it an accidental death. Jake on the other hand, saw it as murder, believing the pieces in this puzzle all fit. The first piece started with the fake Evelyn looking to bust Mulray with a mysteriously significant mistress, thus reaching the second piece as the real Evelyn sues, then quickly draws back on the lawsuit, ending with the final piece of Mulray's murder. The plot escalates from secrets into answers stemming to the very dark and puzzled world Gittes use to live in. If non of you readers get what I'm talking about, I mean Chinatown, a place where the cops were meant to do as little as possible, never knowing whether they were helping the good or the bad. Chinatown, a place riddled with corruption, drugs, and dark aspiring mystery. Thus, Jakes suspicions place him on a quest to find the whole point of this elaborate plot to bury the truth, following up all kinds of leads that'll make viewers ask more and more questions on the very little, but defining significance they represent. Take for instance the missing mistress of Hollis Mulray. Why is it so important to Noah Cross that she be found? According to Evelyn and several people at Water and Power, Mulray and Cross had a falling out on where the water in LA should go. Either to the City or the People of LA. Many were suffering from the drought, particularly those in the south, raising live stock, with little water, and poisoned wells. It all seems detrimental. More though to the mystery of Hollis's murder, the truth behind it goes to the nature of secrecy that Plagues Chinatown. A little bird (Fake Eveyln) sings a little, giving Jake a few names to look up, only to see their names as the already deceased, leaving him with the conclusion that Hollis knew to much. Jake himself puts himself in the same shoes, as he learns far more about his employer Evelyn than he should know. After a quick, but in the moment and straight to the bedroom romance with Evelyn, Jake's sense to spy leads to the discovery of Hollis's missing mistress, and forcing Evelyn to tell more than she's been saying half the film. Baring the child of your own father, while calling yourself her sister must no doubt be one of the toughest burdens ever, especially when it come to protecting that secret from a man who wants to have the child as his own. Noah Cross, the master mind behind all, reveals not only his place of being Katherine's father, but also the intention of incorporating LA's Northwest valley, and thus irrigating it. As we viewers draw to a close, the films ends in its title of focus, Chinatown. When struggling for the truth, Jake fails to save those he loves at the very remark of Forget it Jake its Chinatown. A magnificent ending to film, that incorporates the elements of historical corruption, love, mystery, thrill, suspense, and furthermore the realistic notion of it's title Chinatown. Chinatown, like general life is what it is, sometimes good triumphs over evil, and the other times, evil triumphs over good to our personal distaste. I honestly see this as one of Nicholson's most trademarked characters, using both his dark and even haunting history, as well as his slick wit to further move himself forward in the films mystery of a story, while collaborating with Dunaway's portrayal of an even more tortured figure. Mulray has gone through the unholy touch of her father at the bedside, hiding his child, and doing all she can to conceal her truth, expressing her partial dishonesty in the very doubt of her voice. Despite his short screen time, John Houston's performance is both as haunting, and yet the least tortured of the film's characters, feeling little regret for his sins, while pursuing his power hungry goals with an almost terrifying form of expressing his want for them. Chinatown itself, using it's musical romance theme can haunt a fan, almost as much as it's done to the hero J.J. Gittes.

According to Evelyn and several people at Water and Power, Mulray and Cross had a falling out on where the water in LA should go. Either to the City or the People of LA.

Jake himself puts himself in the same shoes, as he learns far more about his employer Evelyn than he should know. After a quick, but in the moment and straight to the bedroom romance with Evelyn, Jake's sense to spy leads to the discovery of Hollis's missing mistress, and forcing Evelyn to tell more than she's been saying half the film. Baring the child of your own father, while calling yourself her sister must no doubt be one of the toughest burdens ever, especially when it come to protecting that secret from a man who wants to have the child as his own. Noah Cross, the master mind behind all, reveals not only his place of being Katherine's father, but also the intention of incorporating LA's Northwest valley, and thus irrigating it. As we viewers draw to a close, the films ends in its title of focus, Chinatown. When struggling for the truth, Jake fails to save those he loves at the very remark of Forget it Jake its Chinatown. A magnificent ending to film, that incorporates the elements of historical corruption, love, mystery, thrill, suspense, and furthermore the realistic notion of it's title Chinatown. Chinatown, like general life is what it is, sometimes good triumphs over evil, and the other times, evil triumphs over good to our personal distaste. I honestly see this as one of Nicholson's most trademarked characters, using both his dark and even haunting history, as well as his slick wit to further move himself forward in the films mystery of a story, while collaborating with Dunaway's portrayal of an even more tortured figure. Mulray has gone through the unholy touch of her father at the bedside, hiding his child, and doing all she can to conceal her truth, expressing her partial dishonesty in the very doubt of her voice. Despite his short screen time, John Houston's performance is both as haunting, and yet the least tortured of the film's characters, feeling little regret for his sins, while pursuing his power hungry goals with an almost terrifying form of expressing his want for them. Chinatown itself, using it's musical romance theme can haunt a fan, almost as much as it's done to the hero J.J. Gittes. ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"11 January 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" A long time favorite of mine and a classic that I believe Jack Nicholson can truly be remembered for as his greatest work of cinematic art. Director Roman Polanski and screen writer Robert Towne give audiences a masterpiece of both drama and suspense from the wondering viewpoint of Nicholson's character Gittes, a man who's profession is to find the truth, although the truth might be more than what he'd hoped to discover. Having a dark history in La's Chinatown, Gittie makes his honest living by exploiting the dark secrets few people want out. The secrets usually are born from either rumors or suspicions of affairs. A mysterious women claiming to be Hollis Mularay's wife, Evelyn hires Jake to scoop out the truth and find out if there really is someone else. Jake would've probably thought of old Hollis to be the most fascinating tail he's ever tracked in years, following him to public meetings, beaches, and even a mistress that finishes it all. Hollis is no ordinary guy, being the partner of Noah Cross (Houston), Evelyn's crafty and suspicious father, in the LA water and power department. It doesn't really matter to Jake, all that matters is his objective, and the sweet payday received for his work. His work results in more than just a simple check, but the consequences of widespread publicity, attracting the attention of the real, and truly more sophisticated Evelyn Mulray (Dunaway), who feels both insulted and obliged for the matter to be taken care of courtroom style. It's to Jakes luck and Evelyn's misfortune that he never sees the sight of judge, at the cost of Hollis's life though. The very sight of his body being dragged from a water reservoir, with salt water in his lungs is enough for the cops to call it an accidental death. Jake on the other hand, saw it as murder, believing the pieces in this puzzle all fit. The first piece started with the fake Evelyn looking to bust Mulray with a mysteriously significant mistress, thus reaching the second piece as the real Evelyn sues, then quickly draws back on the lawsuit, ending with the final piece of Mulray's murder. The plot escalates from secrets into answers stemming to the very dark and puzzled world Gittes use to live in. If non of you readers get what I'm talking about, I mean Chinatown, a place where the cops were meant to do as little as possible, never knowing whether they were helping the good or the bad. Chinatown, a place riddled with corruption, drugs, and dark aspiring mystery.

Occasionally though, the breakneck camera work and unconventional angles get in the way of the storytelling and the action, so while Fincher succeeded in trying to impress, occasionally he tried too hard. The plot is also rather formulaic, the script is sometimes lacking and the film loses its way in the pacing towards the end.However, I loved the suspenseful atmosphere, there were occasions throughout the course of the film where it was claustrophobic, and the scenery and dark colour palette were well judged. When the dialogue was good, it was good, while Panic Room does start off wonderfully with a very innovative title sequence. Although it does lose its way, the pace is efficient enough to keep the plot afloat, and the acting is fine. Jodie Foster is very good as the gutsy heroine, while Forrest Whittaker is quite poignant as one of the intruders.

The visuals, music, stunt work and acting are what really impress though. The film looks gorgeous, all Ang Lee's films look beautiful but this gets my vote as his most visually stunning. The cinematography is beautiful, and the scenery and costumes are exquisite. The stunt work is brilliantly choreographed and the special effects actually enhance rather than distract. The music is just gorgeous, there were a few scenes where I was reduced to tears. And there are many memorable scenes especially the jaw-dropping rooftop pursuit and tree top battle. As for the acting, Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh both excel, and I was surprised in a very good way by Zhang Ziyi who is electrifying as the teenage thief.In conclusion, this is a breathtaking film and a must see for anyone who loves martial arts or visually stunning movies especially. 10\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":"Action, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"11 January 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is in my opinion the greatest of all the gangster movies and certainly the most underrated. I love the way the film slips seamlessly between their childhood to De Niro leaving prison as an adult. James Woods can not have had a finer performance in his career. The score is fantastic and fits like a glove to the action. The ending is as thought provoking as you can get and leaves you asking several questions. The rape scene is undoubtedly shocking but epitomises their relationship and De Niro's frustration and his descent in to madness. For me this is far better than the Godfather movies and slightly more enjoyable than the more modern Goodfellas.

By the time the movie was over, The Rescuers had easily found it's way to the top of my list of favorite Disney movies.This movie isn't one of those kids' movies where it's a pain to sit through. The whole movie has a charm to it that hasn't been around in Disney films for quite a while - there is a certain atmosphere in it apart.The plot is about two mice, Bernard and Miss Bianca, who set out to rescue a girl, Penny, from an evil old jewel-hunting wench named Medusa. Many parts of the film are very creative - for example, the mice have miniature versions of the human world scattered about. Humans have the UN, the mice have the RAS (Rescue Aid Society). Humans take airplanes, mice take the albatross. There aren't any of those long boring parts that kids may complain about in earlier Disney movies, either. You know, characters bursting into long song, soppy love montages, etc.The characters are especially unique and lovable, and you may find yourself having a hard time picking a favorite. I don't see how you couldn't like this movie, unless you're in that phase where everything not rated PG-13 is babyish and lame.For an hour and fifteen minutes, the movie is a tad on the short side compared to today's five-hour-epic-saga films, but there is nothing missing.Bottom line Great movie, classy, charming, won't forget it - definitely worth watching.
