Now, the film is about Stanley Marokitzadana or something and him trying to become a famous comedian on a cruise. The movie is particularly funny every noun and then and the jokes that are not hilarious are just funny and sadly some were not funny at all but it does not matter cause their funny jokes are more often. I think Adam Sandler did a very good job as the waiter and the bit where the plot gets so out of hand is just so damn funny ( last 5 minutes) and the bit where he is explaining how the earthquake cost them no money was also in the good jokes section. Also the terrorists are funny as well but sadly do not play a huge part in this funny, funny film. Overall fans of Adam Sandler will enjoy this film as it is first movie and you can really see how he became as funny as he is. I rate this film 54% for keeping me amused while being pretty hit and miss. So grab some mates and grab some beers and just watch a good movie starring Adam Sandler as his good old self. GO ADAM SANDLER AND THE WHOLE CREW IN THIS GREAT FILM YOU GUYS ROCK. Also to those out there who do not like this movie I think it is because you were expecting too much out of Adam Sandler's first movie cause in my opinion it is not as good as his other stuff but is definitely better then a lot of other comedy's out there and I even think it is funnier then Click ( not really but probably 3 quarters there. Thats my 2 cents from LacTheBod. I do not know maybe one day this will be respected as it is meant to be, as a comedy just made to introduce Adam Sandler to it's expecting audience. If you did not like this you have to high a standards as it is better then some new movies out there.

Ask yourself the question, why did he want to commit suicide in the first place. The reason is that throughout the first half of the film\/story, all you see is everyone doing what they want, including his brother.

Where were the 'friends and family' when things got bad, why didn't anyone see what was going on. The main reason was cause they were more concerned with themselves. The outcome of all this is the famous bridge seen.

There are a number of scenes where the two of them are conversing, and I had no idea what either of them were saying.

Still, now that I've seen it all, I wish I hadn't. Seeing a respected athlete and star like Jim Brown with that ridiculous skunk hairdo made a painful experience agonizing.

He represents the factors keeping the Maoris in this setting; low income, poor education and senseless violence. Where as Grace is his polar opposite, representing hope. Can hope help these people break out of the prison that is Jake's attributes. I think that is the main question behind the film. This film won't steadily lead you from a grim reality to a happy one or vise versa. It's a struggle for the characters throughout the film as they keep diving in and out of a dysfunctional and dangerous pool until finally the most pure of characters doesn't make it out.

Alien 3 had underdeveloped storyline. It had a few great elements (especially towards the end), but that's it. I never really got into that movie.The premise of this movie seemed intriguing scientists capture a bunch of aliens, doing various kinds of experiments on them. Wow! This will be a great movie - I thought.But I was wrong. AR failed to deliver on almost all levels of entertainment.Story-wise it was okay at best. Scientists, yes, but they don't show you too much experiments. Just one scene made it into the final cut, when the main bad guy, the evil scientist tortures an alien then it learns which switch does that and becomes afraid of it. Big deal! We already knew aliens are smarter than a dog, so even if it's memorable, it has no impact whatsoever.Effects-wise it has nice details and an unique feel for it, but again, nothing special. Aliens look slimier than ever and I didn't like that. Look at the original alien in the 1979 movie it was smooth and clean, huge and sinister. These new ones are smaller, slimier and don't look that frightening. Sure they're faster, but that's not the aliens' main strength. It is the fear they generate that matters, and it's minimal in this movie. Aliens on the other hand also featured smaller, faster and slimier aliens than the original one, but it had great story, great cast and brilliantly directed scenes. Although their charisma was downgraded a bit, the movie was equally good. Cameron created memorable scenes using the aliens, while Jeunet failed to come up anything that catches you off-guard. Even the swimming aliens were somewhat dull. You could see that from a mile and a half away...And we've now come to the most important aspect of this movie, which could've saved it completely. Characters. Having great characters in a movie is essential to the storytelling. It was Hudson, Hicks, Vasquez, Ripley, Burke, Ash, Lambert, Parker and the others who made the first two movie. In the third movie it was hard to find anyone who matched Ripley, but Clemens came close. Anyhow, that movie at least had decent ones. AR only has Ron Perlman as Johner, and that's it. And he isn't even playing a character, it's just that he has a certain screen presence which I happen to like. But I couldn't give the slightest damn about anyone in this movie. Not even Ripley.Well, that's a bit confusing. Ripley is dead, isn't she? Yep. She is. This Ripley we see in this movie is completely changed. She's an alien. Thus the Alien series lost their most important character, and it's a disaster when you cannot even like the main protagonist in a movie. Her mood, her tone of voice, her remarks, her view... all has changed to... well, alien. She even has acid blood for crying out loud! And no, the problem is not that she was cloned. The problem is that you can't root for a person like this. And in the end, there's no one else left. You don't care about the characters, the story or about the newborn alien, whose design is beyond ridiculous. Come on! Giger is spinning in his grave! Overall, it turns out to be a movie that you don't care about. It's not good, it's not bad, it's completely neutral. So it's right in the centre of your rating system.

Although their charisma was downgraded a bit, the movie was equally good. Cameron created memorable scenes using the aliens, while Jeunet failed to come up anything that catches you off-guard. Even the swimming aliens were somewhat dull. You could see that from a mile and a half away...And we've now come to the most important aspect of this movie, which could've saved it completely. Characters. Having great characters in a movie is essential to the storytelling. It was Hudson, Hicks, Vasquez, Ripley, Burke, Ash, Lambert, Parker and the others who made the first two movie. In the third movie it was hard to find anyone who matched Ripley, but Clemens came close. Anyhow, that movie at least had decent ones. AR only has Ron Perlman as Johner, and that's it. And he isn't even playing a character, it's just that he has a certain screen presence which I happen to like. But I couldn't give the slightest damn about anyone in this movie. Not even Ripley.Well, that's a bit confusing. Ripley is dead, isn't she? Yep. She is. This Ripley we see in this movie is completely changed. She's an alien. Thus the Alien series lost their most important character, and it's a disaster when you cannot even like the main protagonist in a movie. Her mood, her tone of voice, her remarks, her view... all has changed to... well, alien. She even has acid blood for crying out loud! And no, the problem is not that she was cloned. The problem is that you can't root for a person like this. And in the end, there's no one else left. You don't care about the characters, the story or about the newborn alien, whose design is beyond ridiculous. Come on! Giger is spinning in his grave! Overall, it turns out to be a movie that you don't care about. It's not good, it's not bad, it's completely neutral. So it's right in the centre of your rating system. One viewing is enough, because you can think about what went wrong, and how it could've been better, but that's it.

To me, the previous three films had a good balance of action and comedy. The fourth installment is a good example of what happens when too much improvisation is allowed on set. There are times when the script seems virtually non-existent, as the actors play out these lame gags that go on way too long and truly take away from the story. Surely, the addition of Chris Rock to the cast helped ruin the film. I enjoy Rock as a comedian. His stand-up is incredible.

I didn't find him even partially convincing as a police detective, and found him to be much more annoying than funny. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover still had the great chemistry, but they seemed more concerned with being an Abbott-and-Costello-type comedy team than being Riggs and Murtaugh.

Unlike Eraserhead, which before also puzzled audiences, Lost Highway has a ratio of meaning that is just right. It desires to be analyzed. It is also his most frightening film. It is perhaps a film that you do not want to invite into your living room. My strategy to describe this movie is as before, to decide first of all what is real, and then what is not real. Lynch told audiences that this movie is about the OJ Simpson case. He was puzzled with the notion that a person can walk away from a crime, seemingly capable of forgetting that he did it. The way I see it, the central character in Lost Highway has a split identity, triggered by murdering his girlfriend. As a grown up this character has the identity Fred Madison (someone who likes to remember things his own way, not necessarily how it happened), a saxophone player, played by Bill Pullman. Fred murders his girlfriend Renee Madison, played by Patricia Arquette, and ends up in jail. (But, for all that you know he was already in jail, for murdering her the first time. I don't know.) The 24 year old younger Fred is Peter Dayton, a mechanic, played by Balthazar Getty. Pete falls in love with one of the shop's main customer's (Mister Eddy, also known as Dick Laurent) girlfriend. The girlfriend is Alice, again played by Patricia Arquette. Mister Eddy is smooth as 'sh*t from a duck's ass' and on the wrong side of the law, with an abhorrence of tailgating. He and Andy are making porn\/snuff films, with Alice as one of the actresses. My assumption is that Pete ends up killing Alice. The truth grid of the story is thus the following The main character, Pete Dayton, kills his girl friend because he can never fully have her, and keeps re imagining himself and her in fragments of the truth. He keeps re inventing the situation. Everything that does not stick to the grid is fabrications of Pete in his attempt to forget and re invent, and part of the process Lynch follows. I'm going to highlight some important aspects of the film. Pete gets very likely jealous of Alice at one point. She asks him Do you still want me Pete? and tells him then But, you can never have me. One never actually sees Pete murder Alice. My point is that what is happening, is kind off similar to what we have in Solaris. The beloved personality returns. No matter how many times Pete\/Fred murders her, she always returns. In his mind, she might appear like twin sisters in a portrait. She doubles up like Dolly. If this movie would have continued, it could have opened with another manifestation of Fred, now middle age, and Patricia Arquette returning as his fixation. It is the obsession of a man that can never 'have her'. Fred meets a freaky looking mystery man played by Robert Blake at a party of Renee. The mystery man told Fred that they have met before, at Fred's house, and that he was invited into Fred's house by Fred himself, It is not my custom to go where I am not invited. This is likely because Fred has murdered before, as the younger man, Pete. However, the mystery man said the same thing to Pete We have met before, haven't we. We all know Lynch use mantra like phrases that reappear thru out his films. But I think this could reflect on the relativity theory and on the nature of time; on the configuration of Lost Highway, and likely of evil in itself. Pete invites evil into his house when he ends up murdering Alice, with the result that he is also then introduced to it at an earlier stage, to 'back up' the present. That is why he has met the mystery man before he even murdered Alice. The past is altered, and his parents, having watched parts of it, are 'lost for words'. It is kind off interesting that Fred decides to leave himself a message on his house intercom Dick Laurent is dead. I think the mystery man whispered that in his ear, after Mister Eddy is killed. Linearly that is a tough part to explain, because the cops show up at that point. It might just fall thru the truth grid. It could be fabrication.I'd like to add some references to Transendental Meditation (a process Lynch follows) here. The mantra needs to be repeated as easily as thoughts; as easily as thoughts manifest in your mind. It needs to float thru one's mind as effortlessly as clouds. I like to think here of the density of Patricia Arquette's words. Her voice has an ethereal quality. It must have appeared to Pete like utter magic on the phone. (Floating like smoke thru the holes in the receiver) It must have been an invitation that was inescapable. Meet me at the Starlight Hotel at Sycamore, in 20 minutes But her tease proved to be ultimately too much for him. Miaaw miaaw. It's me. I can't see you tonight The film has spectacular moments. One of them is when Mister Eddy had Alice at his house the first time. This is one of my all time favourite scenes. Marilyn Manson's I've put a spell on you in the background. A fire blazing in the fireplace and Alice in her black underwear, sensually, and uncertainly awaiting Mister Eddy's orders. Mister Eddy's small nod for Alice, to approach him. The gun against her head. And, Pete asking her, So, why didn't you just leave? You've must have liked it.

Just recently an article in New Scientist magazine reported that an essentially empty area of our universe has been discovered nearly a billion light years across, implying the presence of a second universe beyond our own. Coming just a few weeks after other scientists drew the conclusion that parallel universes, which exist in the same area as our own but in overlapping space, may be real. This new discovery amounts to a shift in our understanding of reality.I was thinking about this while watching Akira, the breakthrough Japanese anime doomsday fantasy by Katsuhiro Otomo from 1988 in which the old order has broken down and strange and powerful forces are working to propel the planet into a new universe. A masterpiece of technical animation, Akira is also a complex and challenging work of art that baffled Western audiences when it first appeared in 1990 but who appreciated its exciting animated style. At that time, animation was considered in the same vein as a children's cartoon, without artistic or intellectual substance but Akira changed that perception to the degree that anime in the 90s became one of Japan's chief cultural exports.The film opens in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo in 2019, 31 years after World War III. Adapted from Katsuhiro Otomo's long running manga comic book (originally published in a teen magazine), Akira complements its non-stop action and explosive violence with recognizable human beings who can express complex emotions. While the film also contains a political thread in which young people rebel against authority and seek freedom from oppression, the plot is not as significant as the magnificent colors and the quality of the animation.The main character is Tetsuo, a member of a teenage biker gang (bosozoku) led by his friend Kaneda Shotaro. The film revolves around Tetsuo's relationship with Kaneda. Growing up together, Kaneda has always comes to his aid, but the situation has fostered both Tetsuo's dependence and resentment. During a motorcycle ride, Tetsuo encounters a strange psychic child whom he later learns has been frozen into an unnatural aged childhood as a result of group experiments with telekinesis. Tetsuo's encounter with the child unleashes his own telekinetic energies and the story becomes one of his growing powers developing against a background of civil riots, terrorism, and government crackdowns.Taken captive by government scientists who experiment on him, Tetsuo is transformed into an unrecognizable creature that can unleash super powers, capable of doing considerable harm to himself and others. Escaping across the city in search of Akira, the entity rumored to be the most powerful of the group of child mutants, Tetsuo becomes a lonely outcast cut off from his friends, then disappears. As the screen is filled with silence, a radiant white dot comes down from the sky and we hear in voice-over the words It's begun. What has ended and what has begun may not be fully understood until five years from now.
