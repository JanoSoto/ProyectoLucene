Most of us have never seen a game on the TV or in a stadium and I'm sure that most of us don't know anything about it. This is of course a great problem for a movie that has a baseball player and the events in his life as its main storyline. Many Americans will love this movie anyway, but it is a lot harder to get it sold to the Europeans if the story and the acting aren't excellent.The good thing about this movie is that it isn't just based on the sport itself, but that it also has a romance to offer for those who don't know anything about baseball. Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is at the end of his career and he has to decide whether he will keep playing, but for another team, and risking to loose the woman he loves or stop his career and save his love life. What should he do? Choose the game that influenced his entire life or the woman he loves? In the meantime he recollects all the memories of how he once met her, their first date, the happy times, the miscommunication and all other things that once happened between them. The movie on itself is OK, without really excelling and the same could be said about the performances of the different actors. They didn't do something wrong, but I've seen some better acting before. All in all this is a decent movie with a decent story and good acting, but without a very good character study. Nevertheless this is still a movie that is worth a watch and that's why I give it a 7\/10.

And to make things worse, it's controversial as well because the story isn't exactly about a family living together happy with more money than there is water in the sea. And they weren't afraid to put a lot of racism in it, which was necessary to make this movie believable, but for some politically correct people, already reasons enough to say they didn't like it.The movie tells us the story of Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), a racist white prison guard who works on Death Row and Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry), a black woman whose husband is about to be executed. Hank lives with his father and his son, who he really hates, under the same roof. But when a tragedy takes his son away, he starts thinking about his ideas. In the mean while he has met Leticia, not knowing who she really is and soon they fall in love with each other. This is the start of a relationship based rather on desperation than on love.Monster's ball doesn't use cheap Hollywood sentiment like you might expect from this kind of movies, but is sincere and very compelling. This is of course also thanks to excellent performances. Halle Berry got an Oscar for it, but what I don't understand is why Billy Bob Thornton wasn't even nominated. His character may not be as likable and no he isn't as good looking as Berry, but his performance certainly wasn't any less. In fact, the entire movie was more than just worth a watch. It's very nice to see that there still are unknown directors who can make good movies with a good story, some fine actors and a small budget. I really enjoyed it and that's why I give it an 8\/10.

It starts off promising, everyone is excited about the journey that lies ahead, and the train's grace and splendor is so inviting (a.k.a the witty dialogue and Norton's narration has set us up for quite a ride). Then with out warning the engineer (a.k.a the writer) picks up the train's speed and it continues to accelerate down the track until a marvelous crash, which leaves us wondering as to what happened?

Edward Norton is a down and out guy so upset with his life that his only perk (and only way to sleep) is to go to different support groups (i.e. Smoker's Anonymous, Men With Testicular Cancer, etc.) and wallow in other people's misery. Unfortunately for Ed's character, a very strange woman, Marla, comes along and ruins his fun, for she is doing the same exact thing he is. In an amusing scene, Ed's character and Marla decide to split up the support groups so that they do not have to cross each other's paths. Well, after this bit all seems well for Ed until he meets a very strange, machoistic, and aggressive guy named Tyler (Brad Pitt). Eventually Ed's character befriends Tyler and the two of them start a fight club to get there aggression out on each other and anyone else who would like to join. This is where the movie begins to deteriorate. Ed's character and Tyler start the club so that they can get their lives back on track (or at least this is true for Ed's character), and it works--everything seems a-OK after a few brawls with the locals. Now what does this tell us? That violence will make everything alright? It seems to me that the latter is the message, and I have a problem with that because violence never solves anything.

You see, the problem is that this movie becomes a bit of a paradox; it tells us to not buy into materialism because it is superficial and unneeded (which by the way I agree with), but at the same time it tells us to use fist fights and terrorism as a means to achieve our goals (which is just so much more logical then buying into materialism--our we honestly suppose to believe this junk?). It seems to me that the writer was just another crazed radical who so happened to have some good ideas for a movie.

But I've got to be honest, sometimes I'm wrong. The movie isn't actually that bad at all.It tells the story of a family that has been ripped apart after a feud many years ago. One sister, who now has leukemia, has stayed with her bedridden father since his first stroke 17 years earlier. The other one moved to another state and has never visited her family ever again, partly because she already had enough problems of her own, but also because she's a bit egoistic.

Then a few days ago I saw it on TV, and I have to say, it's definitely better than I remember it now.It starts out in a slightly surreal style as we get to follow the employees of the Umbrella Corp., and the events leading to the disaster in the underground laboratory. Then in the same style we get to follow an agent waking up and how she meet the SWAT-like squad she's to work together with to set things straight again.The overall feeling of the movie is hard to describe but I like it. No nonsense, just straight forward action. No second wasted. I am sure there were clichés in this film but certainly not many and apparently they didn't bother me anyway. Usually when you watch a B action you can get bored simply because it's like every other B action. Not so with Resident Evil, which was not B in my opinion.Visually, it's also great. At times it was almost a dream-like feeling, from the intro laboratory scenes to the scenes from Alice's home; and most that happened thereafter.As for storytelling, it told us what we needed to know, nothing more. If there's anything from the introduction scenes that leaves us wondering what in the world happened, who did it and why, we will get the answers as the story moves on.Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriquez both make their parts really well in my opinion. I have not seen Milla in many other movies but what I've seen so far, I definitely like. Michelle was entirely new to me as far as I know, but I liked her performance.My complaint could possibly be that some devices in the laboratory seemed a bit of a stretch, especially one particular security defense mechanism that they encountered early on.All in all, a good action that is somewhat unusual in its style.

Her father Mr. Leonard D' Onofrio a cop played by James Wood and, her mother Mrs. Teresa D' Onofrio a housewife played by Lorraine Barrco . Drew Barrymore's character in the movie Bev is a smart, beautiful young woman who can't wait to grow up and accomplish her dream of moving to New York to become a writer. Her life takes its first detour when she becomes pregnant at 15 with her son Jason D' Onofrio played by Adam Garcia. In which, his character struggles with a complex relationship with his mother Bev throughout the film. Bev still desires to finish high school and attend college but, she is forced to put those goals aside. She reluctantly marries her son's father, Raymond Hasek played by Steve Zahn. Ray a dropout, heroin junkie messes up her life from the time she meets him until the time she lets him go. This movie is a perfect real life illustration showing just because your life takes a detour does not mean you can not accomplish your dream.Throughout the movie Drew Barrymore's life takes numerous detours. She gets pregnant at a young age. She forces herself to marry someone she did not love because of her parents. And she had to learn how to love and care for a child that she did not want. In the end, she was able to take the detours and arrive at destination point, she was able to achieve her dream of becoming a writer. She used her life of love, loss, and heartache which she incorporated into an inspiring auto- biography about the trails and triumph of taking an unbeaten path and still arriving at her dream.Ms. Drew Barrymore does a wonderful job in this film. Her acting is brilliant. Her performance seemed as if she once lived this life. Steve Zahn also gives a solid performance as Ray Hasek, Beverly's junkie husband. This movie has a great cast Brittany Murphy, Adam Garcia, Rosie Perez, James Woods, Lorraine Bracco, Pete Facinelli, and Maggie Gyllenhad. Together they all brought the movie alive, the actors\/actresses really drew a vibrant and interesting picture of the characters they depicted.After viewing Riding in Cars with Boys I thought about another movie I really enjoyed similar to it called Rudy.

I admit that his latest work is really very good, not to say excellent, but movies like this one show that he had to go a long way before getting there.Heartbreak Ridge is situated in 1983, when Gunnery Sergeant Tom 'Gunny' Highway (Clint Eastwood) rejoins his old recon unit in the Marines. He's a battle hardened and decorated veteran from the Korean and Vietnam war who will have to train his new unit. But that unit isn't exactly what you expect from a platoon of Marines. They are all lazy and more interested in style, music, drinking and in chasing women, than in training for combat missions, let alone in fighting the enemy. But Highway isn't just the average drill sergeant either and he'll teach them what it is to be a real marine, something that will be very useful when they have to go to Grenada, where they will have to rescue the American citizens and fight the Cubans. In the meantime he also tries to reconnect with his ex-wife, who still sees him as a gun-ho, who has always been more interested in the army than in her...What you'll see is the typical Clint Eastwood like we know from the Dirty Harry-movies. He's a grumpy macho who doesn't speak much, except with his fists. I'm sure that many people will love that, but I don't like him all that much in this kind of roles. In fact, I didn't like this entire movie... It felt a bit too much like an advertisement campaign from the Marine Corps and not all that much like a movie.

I know that many men prefer this kind of war movies, but I certainly don't.Nevertheless, I have to admit that not everything about this movie is bad. I sometimes had a good laugh with it too, especially when he tried to make up with his wife and therefor started reading women's magazines.

The men are guilty of dirty, lustful thoughts (and some of more than just thoughts), the women are guilty of gossip, violence and probably more than a little envy, and Malena is guilty of being a homewrecker. But in looking back at the movie it seems that what caused the problems were two things &#150; gossip and something like insecurity.Roger Ebert wrote probably the most idiotic review I've ever seen him come out with about this movie. He missed the point of this movie even more than he missed the point of Memento, and his review of that movie was like a blind man describing a shooting star. He describes Malena as a schoolteacher of at least average intelligence, who must be aware of her effect on the collective local male libido, but seems blissfully oblivious.Roger, seriously, are you joking? BLISSFULLY?? Did you sleep through this movie?She almost never speaks at all and never displays even the slightest hint of a smile. Given the extent of her depression and stifling sadness, it is astounding to me that anyone in their right mind could attach the word blissfully to any element of her character.I know what that's like though, because sometimes I completely miss something about a movie and I think that something else is the stupidest thing in the world because of it, at least until someone explains what I missed and then it all makes sense. Watch Malena, for example, walking through the central square in town at any point in the movie. If you think she keeps her eyes on the ground directly in front of her because she is in a state of pure, ignorant bliss, then trust me. You are missing something.I don't know if Malena was actually unaware of the effect that she had on the townspeople, but I find it nearly impossible to believe that she did. That thought actually never even occurred to me until I read Roger Ebert's gem of a review. Her behavior struck me much more like someone who had been dealing with such behavior from the men around for her whole life. I doubt very much that she doesn't understand the concepts of human physical attraction.Moving on. Set against the backdrop of World War II reminded me of Life is Beautiful, especially given the uncertain mix of comedy and tragedy. It wasn't as powerful on both sides here as in Life is Beautiful, but it was truly heartbreaking to see Malena suffering and trying to ignore the increasing tension that was being generated around her.It's hard to say that she was a victim of her own beauty, but it was really what drove all of the conflict in the story. The women at first seemed to be upset with their husbands because of their stares, and things got worse and worse because of the endless gossip which seemed to monopolize the talk of the entire town. If anyone was talking about anything, it had something to do with the latest sexual escapades of Malena.Women would not sell her good food at the town market, so she had to get it from men who expected things in return. There was a scene where an officer was at her home, but I don't think there was any indication that they had sex. It was clear that he was more interested than she was, and later it was her that wound up in court for having an amorous relationship with a married man in uniform. The courtroom performance of Malena's lawyer, by the way, is one of the highlights of the movie.I'm not really sure how to feel about the women involved in the climax of their collective hatred of Malena, because surely Malena did not sleep with the husband of every woman involved, and of those whose husbands committed no crime other than looking at a beautiful woman, what did they then think of their wives, who would do such a thing out of pure jealousy and envy? I'm a man myself; so I can't speak from a woman's point of view, but if your husband cheats on you, take it out on him. Don't go and beat up the subject of his affections, especially if it is nothing more than a beautiful woman that he looked at. Imagine all of the attractive women beaten up without knowing why.Weaving his way throughout all of this chaos is Renato, a 12-year-old boy who has conceptualized Malena as the ideal woman in all ways. He sees himself as her protector, desperate to save her from the tension that he sees growing around her, the unfair antagonism that is being leveled at her, for really no fault of her own. His identification of Malena as the subject of his developing sexuality reminded me of another great film, The Hairdresser's Husband. If you liked this, see that one, too. Oh and if you're Roger Ebert, maybe watch this one again.And stay awake this time.

If anyone was talking about anything, it had something to do with the latest sexual escapades of Malena.Women would not sell her good food at the town market, so she had to get it from men who expected things in return. There was a scene where an officer was at her home, but I don't think there was any indication that they had sex. It was clear that he was more interested than she was, and later it was her that wound up in court for having an amorous relationship with a married man in uniform. The courtroom performance of Malena's lawyer, by the way, is one of the highlights of the movie.I'm not really sure how to feel about the women involved in the climax of their collective hatred of Malena, because surely Malena did not sleep with the husband of every woman involved, and of those whose husbands committed no crime other than looking at a beautiful woman, what did they then think of their wives, who would do such a thing out of pure jealousy and envy? I'm a man myself; so I can't speak from a woman's point of view, but if your husband cheats on you, take it out on him. Don't go and beat up the subject of his affections, especially if it is nothing more than a beautiful woman that he looked at. Imagine all of the attractive women beaten up without knowing why.Weaving his way throughout all of this chaos is Renato, a 12-year-old boy who has conceptualized Malena as the ideal woman in all ways. He sees himself as her protector, desperate to save her from the tension that he sees growing around her, the unfair antagonism that is being leveled at her, for really no fault of her own. His identification of Malena as the subject of his developing sexuality reminded me of another great film, The Hairdresser's Husband. If you liked this, see that one, too.

The men are guilty of dirty, lustful thoughts (and some of more than just thoughts), the women are guilty of gossip, violence and probably more than a little envy, and Malena is guilty of being a homewrecker. But in looking back at the movie it seems that what caused the problems were two things &#150; gossip and something like insecurity.Roger Ebert wrote probably the most idiotic review I've ever seen him come out with about this movie. He missed the point of this movie even more than he missed the point of Memento, and his review of that movie was like a blind man describing a shooting star. He describes Malena as a schoolteacher of at least average intelligence, who must be aware of her effect on the collective local male libido, but seems blissfully oblivious.Roger, seriously, are you joking? BLISSFULLY?? Did you sleep through this movie?She almost never speaks at all and never displays even the slightest hint of a smile. Given the extent of her depression and stifling sadness, it is astounding to me that anyone in their right mind could attach the word blissfully to any element of her character.I know what that's like though, because sometimes I completely miss something about a movie and I think that something else is the stupidest thing in the world because of it, at least until someone explains what I missed and then it all makes sense. Watch Malena, for example, walking through the central square in town at any point in the movie. If you think she keeps her eyes on the ground directly in front of her because she is in a state of pure, ignorant bliss, then trust me. You are missing something.I don't know if Malena was actually unaware of the effect that she had on the townspeople, but I find it nearly impossible to believe that she did. That thought actually never even occurred to me until I read Roger Ebert's gem of a review. Her behavior struck me much more like someone who had been dealing with such behavior from the men around for her whole life. I doubt very much that she doesn't understand the concepts of human physical attraction.Moving on. Set against the backdrop of World War II reminded me of Life is Beautiful, especially given the uncertain mix of comedy and tragedy. It wasn't as powerful on both sides here as in Life is Beautiful, but it was truly heartbreaking to see Malena suffering and trying to ignore the increasing tension that was being generated around her.It's hard to say that she was a victim of her own beauty, but it was really what drove all of the conflict in the story.

Not much later, he was asked to write a third film of the franchise. He said it impacted his writing, as he was out of ideas after writing this one. Well, how many ideas did he have before, exactly? The first had a fairly good plot, but this has the unlucky fate of being the second film in a series of films that started with an idea that only really allowed for one film. The same could be said of Terminator 2, but James Cameron worked that out nicely, by directing a sequel that was almost a remake. But enough about that. Where this movie goes wrong plot-wise is by using a cheap ploy to put Andy, our main character, in basically the exact same situation that he was in the first film; knowing that the doll was alive but no one believing him. That worked well in the first film, partly because we weren't sure if Chucky was alive for a while. Here, it's just a cheap ploy to ensure that no one will help Andy. Of course, this installation also suffers under the curse of sequels to horror movies; everything needs to be bigger(because 'bigger is better'). More deaths, more gruesome death scenes and, for some reason, more obscenities. It might be because Chucky talks more for this one, but he seemed to swear more randomly as well. And why was he suddenly so bloody lighthearted? Early in the film, he seemed to laugh every five seconds. Anyway, the deaths are nicely done, and the fact that there are more of them doesn't bother me(I am a horror fan, after all). It's more how they are virtually ignored or written off by characters in the film. In the first film, the deaths were few and far between, and they looked like accidents. Here, the bodies pile up, and it's clear to anyone that these are intentional killings. Which leads me to a gaping plot hole; in the first, we were told that he was a psychopath and a killer. The killings weren't expanded upon. Here, we're told that he, being the voodoo aficionado that he is, killed them ritually. Now, if he did that when he was alive, why does he settle for just killing people now that he's dead? I mean, he does go out of his way to kill people, but now he doesn't care about the voodoo stuff anymore? What gives? Now, as the one line summary of my comment tells you, this has grotesque amounts of 'fake' scares. For anyone who doesn't know what that means, it's getting a cheap jump-scare out of the viewers through something that has nothing to do with the actual horror of the film. Cat jumping down from high point, friend appearing suddenly from behind character, etc. You know them, I know them, and we(by 'we' I mean us horror fans) all hate them. The plot is somewhat good, what little there is of it, though too much of it is just to set up new Chucky scenes, either involving him going after Andy or killing off one or more of the many characters that have the words 'I'm going to be killed off' printed on their foreheads from the moment we see them(...not literally, of course). Which brings me to the point of the characters. They are somewhat well-written and credible, but they are in no way interesting or likable(with the exception of Andy and Kyle), making them uninteresting victims(where's the fun in seeing you don't care about getting killed?) and they, like the plot, are written around how Chucky acts, to protect him and his 'mission' from interference. The acting is good enough, with Christine Elise and Alex Vincent, the kid who plays Andy being the only two who transcend the mediocre level of acting that everyone else seems to stay at. The special effects have clearly evolved quite a lot since the first, and it makes the Chucky scenes more pleasing to the eye. The end is about as overdone as the first one. All in all, probably only a film for the people who really liked the first. If you only 'kind of' enjoyed the first, you probably won't like this one... unless you thought what the first lacked was more death and less plot. I recommend this to fans of the first and of horror in general. I don't advise anyone to watch this if you haven't seen the first yet, though. Not only is the first a better film, it sets the tone for this pretty well and contains a lot of plot that this doesn't summarize for new viewers. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 March 2005","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Following the success of the first Child's Play Don Mancini was asked to write a sequel.

With echoes of his earlier film 'Knife in the Water', Bitter Moon is a story of lust, revenge, betrayal, dependency and most of all; love, wrapped tightly around a coil of taboos and sexual perversions. While not as good as some of Polanski's other works, Bitter Moon still stands out as a highlight of his filmography and is certainly a lot better than many people have reputed it to be. The film follows two very different couples on a cruise ship; An English couple, Nigel and Fiona and an American cripple, Oscar, who is married to the French seductress Mimi. After meeting Mimi in the ship's bar, Nigel becomes entranced by her and later meets her husband and proceeds to learn his and wife's story...and it's not exactly pretty. With this movie, Polanski has obliterated the barriers of decency, and sometimes even makes you, the viewer, uncomfortable due to the goings on. And that's the mark of someone that knows how to handle his audience! The acting in the movie really is first rate and there isn't a weak link there, especially not within the four leads. I'm no fan of Hugh Grant, in fact I hate the man, but he's exactly the right casting choice for this movie and it's almost a shame that he went on to make lots of rubbish movies after it. The two women, played by Kristin Scott Thomas and Emmanuelle Seigner are well done in terms of the characters and the acting, but it is Peter Coyote who steals the show as the abominable Oscar. His character in this film is the sort that actors can really get their teeth into, and Coyote bites down hard in this movie. Polanski's direction is excellent as usual and the gritty style mixed with the great director's edgy camera-work help to create a claustrophobic environment that allows Polanski to perfectly portray his characters' mindset. The themes on display are impressive, and in spite of the fact that it oversteps the mark on several occasions, Polanski's film always feels real and the lesson in the love that the film teaches is duly noted. Bitter Moon is a film that will get under your skin and stay there and not only that but there's enough happening to ensure that this is always a fun watch. Recommended viewing.

The themes on display are impressive, and in spite of the fact that it oversteps the mark on several occasions, Polanski's film always feels real and the lesson in the love that the film teaches is duly noted. Bitter Moon is a film that will get under your skin and stay there and not only that but there's enough happening to ensure that this is always a fun watch. Recommended viewing.

Not only does he bring forth an arsenal of brilliant directing (his classic car trunk shot), but he also makes a circular film (the beginning and the end are the same). This movie is great, just simply fantastic. And another lovely bonus is that Pulp Fiction never gets old, which is something hard to come by nowadays.

It is only because of the sheer vapidity of the 1990s and 2000s so far that we can look back upon the 1980s with any sense of longing or nostalgia, and the titular duo of this film give us a good understanding of why. The film begins with a great dialogue from George Carlin about this great and wonderful future that was inspired by two legendary musicians. Okay, so far, so good. It is a concept that, while not totally brilliant, can be made to work if exploited properly.The problem here is that the subjects of the film are so utterly vapid that they flatten their own story. They claim to be rebelling against a society that does us all wrong, and that part is true enough, but one fundamental law is that one should never kill a tyrant until one knows whether his successor is an improvement or not. Bill and Ted, as a model for society, definitely aren't. I have read some previous comments that note the fascistic undertone inherent in the film, and I can only agree. Anything that the heroes disagree with or don't like the appearance of is bogus, apparently. One can just sense the kilns being fired up for the autistic or phobic individuals in the San Diemas of the future.Another interesting point is the whitewashing of history that occurs in the process of retrieving the historical figures, all of whom present far more interesting characters than the titular heroes. Apparently, maidens from France of the Middle Ages look exactly like gunslingers of the New Mexico of colonial America, who in turn look exactly like modern Californians. Sure, the inclusion of Napoleon helped with the European element (not). After all, we all know that French military leaders are foul-tempered midgets with bad personal relationship skills. And it is probably best to say nothing at all about Genghis Khan, since he never gets to say anything at all during his performance. About the only opportunity with these characters that gets any exploration at all is Socrates, who provides an interesting insight into the idea of an ancient Greek philosopher being transported into modern times. Unfortunately, since Robert Heinlein had a lot of ideas that Socrates expressed thousands of years ago, such as people being made to make decisions of conscience before they vote in affairs that affect millions, I can honestly imagine Socrates would find Bill, Ted, and pretty much everyone at San Diemas High abhorrent.The film's strengths, which are few in number, include the aforementioned George Carlin. If Doctor Who had been an American show, but had the similar lengthy, sometimes controversial, history that the BBC gave it, it's a safe bet that Carlin would have at some point played the good Doctor. Carlin displays the cool that Bill, Ted, and every San Diemas citizen who gets the slightest screen time seems to want to have. Indeed, part of the fun of Bill And Ted is taking note of how much the so-called good guys act like the dickweeds that they are so fond of calling others. Dan Shor gives a very good performance as Billy The Kid in spite of physically being totally wrong for the part. Shor looks as if he is at least four inches too tall for the part, and is far too muscular. Not to mention that his front teeth are not prominent enough, but that gets back to the Orwellian rearranging of history recently talked about. In spite of these mismatches, Shor at least sells himself as someone you'd take seriously if you met him in the Wild West.Interestingly enough, the film sat on a shelf for two years before Orion bought the rights to it from the De Laurentiis Group and released it upon an unsuspecting world. They must have liked the teen market a lot, since a mere four years would pass before they retooled one of the biggest artistic triumphs they had ever financed for such a market, and as a happy result, went bankrupt. I understand how cutthroat the film business is, but you'd think that film studios would look back at history to see this correlation between disrespecting one's audience and a poor box-office return.One more positive of this film is that it doesn't give a lot of detail about the future that Carlin's character is trying to protect. This allows the audience to fill in some details for themselves, which in turn makes the vapidity of the folk we are told it is based on somewhat less objectionable. With people like Rufus in power, it is easier to believe the future is not dominated by complete morons like the present.Like the sequel, I gave Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure a five out of ten. If you're bored and have nothing better to do, it is an okay way to pass ninety minutes. But if you want something to watch that will do more than fill time, then there is nothing to see here.

Based on a stage play that opened six years earlier, Harvey, the 1950 film directed by Henry Koster, is a delight. If this Jimmy Stewart classic doesn't make you feel good, you must be related to Mr. Henry F. Potter of Bedford Falls. Harvey is a 6' 3'' Pooka who has befriended a certain Mr. Elwood P. Dowd and this causes all sorts of complications for those around him. In case you didn't know, in Celtic mythology a Pooka is a fearsome spirit that usually takes the form of a sleek dark horse that roams the countryside at night, creating harm and mischief. Well, Harvey is not like that at all.In fact, Harvey is a very gentle spirit who is always helping people out and can make everybody around him feel relaxed and in a good mood. Now Dowd needs all the help he can get. He likes to take a nip once in a while and is always talking to that danged rabbit to the chagrin of his sister Veta Louise (Josephine Hull) whose social life takes a nosedive when brother Elwood is around. Elwood's shenanigans also interfere with her plans to marry off her daughter Myrtle Mae (Victoria Home). When Veta decides that she has had enough and tries to commit Elwood to a psychiatric institution, the tables are turned and she ends up being committed in a hilarious case of mistaken identity. When Elwood leaves the hospital after being released, the medical staff in the hospital (a bit eccentric themselves) realize their mistake and all try to find him.The madcap beginning soon turns into a gentle and moving drama. Jimmy Stewart is flawless as the decent man who never loses his temper and always has a smile on his face, giving everyone his card and inviting strangers home for dinner. The supporting cast is top notch as well including the unpleasant Dr. Chumley (Cecil Kellaway), the egotistical psychiatrist Dr. Sanderson (Charles Drake), his love struck assistant Miss Kelley (Peggy Dow) and the overwrought orderly (Jesse White, later known as the Maytag repairman).Eventually some that ridiculed Elwood and his rabbit privately admit that they could see Harvey themselves and by the end we are gradually convinced that the so-called normal people may be stranger than Mr. Dowd. Harvey is considered a classic and with good reason. It works because of its good-natured humor and its gentle slap at those who automatically condemn ideas that are outside socially acceptable norms without thinking for themselves.

In case you didn't know, in Celtic mythology a Pooka is a fearsome spirit that usually takes the form of a sleek dark horse that roams the countryside at night, creating harm and mischief. Well, Harvey is not like that at all.In fact, Harvey is a very gentle spirit who is always helping people out and can make everybody around him feel relaxed and in a good mood. Now Dowd needs all the help he can get. He likes to take a nip once in a while and is always talking to that danged rabbit to the chagrin of his sister Veta Louise (Josephine Hull) whose social life takes a nosedive when brother Elwood is around. Elwood's shenanigans also interfere with her plans to marry off her daughter Myrtle Mae (Victoria Home). When Veta decides that she has had enough and tries to commit Elwood to a psychiatric institution, the tables are turned and she ends up being committed in a hilarious case of mistaken identity. When Elwood leaves the hospital after being released, the medical staff in the hospital (a bit eccentric themselves) realize their mistake and all try to find him.The madcap beginning soon turns into a gentle and moving drama. Jimmy Stewart is flawless as the decent man who never loses his temper and always has a smile on his face, giving everyone his card and inviting strangers home for dinner. The supporting cast is top notch as well including the unpleasant Dr. Chumley (Cecil Kellaway), the egotistical psychiatrist Dr. Sanderson (Charles Drake), his love struck assistant Miss Kelley (Peggy Dow) and the overwrought orderly (Jesse White, later known as the Maytag repairman).Eventually some that ridiculed Elwood and his rabbit privately admit that they could see Harvey themselves and by the end we are gradually convinced that the so-called normal people may be stranger than Mr. Dowd. Harvey is considered a classic and with good reason. It works because of its good-natured humor and its gentle slap at those who automatically condemn ideas that are outside socially acceptable norms without thinking for themselves.

I thought(well, used to think) It's a horror film about a murderous *doll* and it's an 80's flick with a bunch of actors in it that I've never heard of. This film proves quite well how wrong you can judge a book by its cover. Yes, it is a doll doing all the killing, but it's pretty damn creepy. It's also far more creative and smart than your average doll, uh, killer. See the trailer to get an idea of how unusual and creative the death scenes are. The plot is surprisingly good, though there are weak points. The whole voodoo\/magic thing concerning Chucky's birth is kind of... lame and far-fetched, honestly. It is, however, also quite original. And it's the only truly low point for me about the film. Then there's the whole 80's film complex that most, if not all, 80's films have been cursed with. The curse includes, but is not limited to hammy acting, bad dialog, soundtrack consisting of dreaded 80's music and predictability. Fortunately, this film suffers very little under this. The dialog is very obviously 80's at some points, and the acting could definitely improve, particularly with some of the minor characters, but the film manages to create a good deal of unpredictable scenes and the music is so neutral that you couldn't possibly tell from the soundtrack that it's an 80's film. The pacing is pretty good, there's really no point during the film where it's boring. The acting ranges, but the leads are mostly good. I thought the child actor who portrayed Andy did a pretty good job, considering he was 6-7 years old when he did the film. The special effects are so-so, but considering that this was the late 80's, they're sufficiently good, and they are used to great effect. There are plenty of genuine scares in the film. I enjoyed the cinematography, particularly the very good use of long takes and tracking shots. The ending was overdone, and came off as annoying rather than particularly scary. All in all, the film is definitely worth watching if you're into the genre. In the end, it's better than most other 80's flicks, and if you do see it available for rent, it'll probably be cheap, and hey, it's less than 90 minutes long, so it's easy enough to get through. I recommend this to fans of horror films and 80's flicks. If you belong to one of those groups, you'll most likely enjoy it, at least to some extent. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 March 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I finally pulled myself together and sat down to watch this film, after putting it off for a long time.
