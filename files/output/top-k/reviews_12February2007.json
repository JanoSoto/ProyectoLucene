That first viewing really affected me as a person because I realized what other people can do to me in the way of deceit and surprise. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that this ranks up there as one of the greatest endings of all time. It still packs a wallop fifty years later.The story revolves around a murder with the accused being Tyrone Power. Charles Laughton decides to take on the difficult case with a little help from his loving wife, Elsa Lanchester. The job of the defense becomes even harder when Power's only alibi is his wife, Marlene Dietrich. The thing is, Dietrich is a witness for the prosecution! The entire cast is wonderful in each role. Tyrone Power gives the best performance of his career, and it just happens to be his last one. In fact, this film may just be Lanchester's, Dietrich's, and even Laughton's best work. I don't want to take anything away from Billy Wilder though. His direction guides the film very easily to its climactic scene where all is revealed.We can't forget about those special assets that had to be filmed at a cost of $90,000. Of course, I'm talking about those famous legs of Marlene Dietrich and they figure prominently enough into the movie. Her fans will be lapping it up when they see them and I can definitely understand why. Once you see them, I think you'll agree. All that aside, this is a very excellent film. One that seems a bit underrated today because it isn't seen too often. I assure you, though, everyone I know who has viewed it has thoroughly enjoyed it. It's one of the best films of the 1950s and one of the best of the Golden Age of cinema.I'll end by saying that only Agatha Christie could come up with a plot like this. With twists and turns to lead even Sherlock Holmes to wonder what happened, she has you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you the experience.

In many ways the film plays on themes of voyeurism -- why are we interested in this story? Why do men go to Jane (Kinski) to talk about their issues? I think this film might mean something different to each person who sees it. The film is really sad in the sense in which it shows the consequences of some of our actions, how we destroy our own happiness. Jane tells Travis that she had to send Hunter away because she did not want to fill the void in her life with her son. Yet we know already that Travis cannot fill that void either. I think the film is not really saying anything -- it's more asking us to question the way we treat others and to realize that our relationships are the things that define us in many ways. I see this in Jane\/Travis' relationship and also in the emerging father\/son relationship between Travis and Hunter. For a few days Hunter is actually calling both Walt and Travis dad -- this awkward situation is something that work-a-day good guy Walt thinks is perfectly fine, but Travis I think realizes that the void cannot be filled with two dads.Wonderful film and I look forward to repeat viewings.

This is one of the dumbest dramas(?) of all time. The ultra-cliché premise of a wide-eyed bimbo - with a mysterious past - hitch-hiking her way to Vegas to become a showgirl is a premise that writers of pulp-fiction would shy away from on grounds that it is too cheap and dumb. Berkeley's awful over-acting is hard not to notice from the very start (though, in a way, it fits the movie), but I can't help but sympathize with her because she looks as though she believed that this role was her big breakthrough chance which made her try really, really hard, giving it her all to do it right. (It makes me cringe. I really pity that dumb woman.) But the harder she tried, the more she overacted, and the worse she got. Additionally, far from being her big break, this film will probably haunt her forever.Pitiful attempts to make statements or send messages, or just to philosophize, fall so very, very flat. The characterization is a combination of movie-cliché stereotypes and illogical, hence unpredictable behaviour. Ultra-cretinous dialog infests this strange, Verhoevenish Las Vegas showgirl world, and a multitude of dumb - sometimes mind-numbingly dumb - scenes abound kids in dressing-rooms, girl-fights in dressing rooms, ice being used as nipple-hardener, the rasta guy losing his job for the second time over Berkeley, the sabotage of a showgirl colleague by throwing marbles(?) on the stage - so that she may break a bone or two (very funny), rape by celebrity, revenge for rape of friend by means of karate chops, etc.Verhoeven would like to have us believe that the world of Las Vegas showgirls is no different than the Old Wild West if there is someone who displeases you or that you don't like you just spit in their face, or punch them, or throw marbles(?) on the floor while they're dancing, or push them down a flight of stairs, or fight them in the dressing-room, etc. And what's with Berkeley's sudden display of martial arts moves on the unsuspecting rock star? I mean, we know that she has her mysterious past and all that, but does this mean that she is a karate expert as well? There's plenty of t**s'n'a** here, but I must say that it's the dialogs that steal the show from the showgirls. Examples I liked you when you came... I liked your blue eyes...

(Gershon) Does that p*ss you off 'cause you're jealous, Chris, or because I beat you to the punch?

This is one of the dumbest dramas(?) of all time. The ultra-cliché premise of a wide-eyed bimbo - with a mysterious past - hitch-hiking her way to Vegas to become a showgirl is a premise that writers of pulp-fiction would shy away from on grounds that it is too cheap and dumb. Berkeley's awful over-acting is hard not to notice from the very start (though, in a way, it fits the movie), but I can't help but sympathize with her because she looks as though she believed that this role was her big breakthrough chance which made her try really, really hard, giving it her all to do it right. (It makes me cringe. I really pity that dumb woman.) But the harder she tried, the more she overacted, and the worse she got. Additionally, far from being her big break, this film will probably haunt her forever.Pitiful attempts to make statements or send messages, or just to philosophize, fall so very, very flat. The characterization is a combination of movie-cliché stereotypes and illogical, hence unpredictable behaviour. Ultra-cretinous dialog infests this strange, Verhoevenish Las Vegas showgirl world, and a multitude of dumb - sometimes mind-numbingly dumb - scenes abound kids in dressing-rooms, girl-fights in dressing rooms, ice being used as nipple-hardener, the rasta guy losing his job for the second time over Berkeley, the sabotage of a showgirl colleague by throwing marbles(?) on the stage - so that she may break a bone or two (very funny), rape by celebrity, revenge for rape of friend by means of karate chops, etc.Verhoeven would like to have us believe that the world of Las Vegas showgirls is no different than the Old Wild West if there is someone who displeases you or that you don't like you just spit in their face, or punch them, or throw marbles(?) on the floor while they're dancing, or push them down a flight of stairs, or fight them in the dressing-room, etc. And what's with Berkeley's sudden display of martial arts moves on the unsuspecting rock star? I mean, we know that she has her mysterious past and all that, but does this mean that she is a karate expert as well? There's plenty of t**s'n'a** here, but I must say that it's the dialogs that steal the show from the showgirls. Examples I liked you when you came... I liked your blue eyes... (Kyle) You have great t**s. They're really beautiful. (Gershon)Thank you... (Berkeley) You're a stripper! (Davi) No, I'm a dancer! (Berkeley) I have a problem with pussy. I always have and I'm always gonna, but I meant what I said to you (previously). (rasta guy) You know, it's not like I'm seein' any money from writin' that number (song). I may as well touch a little p**sy. (rasta guy) Must be weird not having anybody come on you... (Davi)You f***ed her, didn't you? (Gershon) Does that p*ss you off 'cause you're jealous, Chris, or because I beat you to the punch? (Kyle) There's also this strange fascination that everyone seems to have for Berkeley's character, as soon as she reaches Vegas the black girl offers her free lodging; Kyle - although constantly surrounded by naked girls - gets more horny than ever over Berkeley; Gershon, Kyle's woman and show-star, can't wait to get a lesbian thing going with Berkeley (who, as a true blond free-spirit with a shady past has - naturally - nothing against a little lesbianism on the side); the rasta guy loses two jobs for Berkeley, while being constantly rejected by her (even kicked in the groin at one point); Davi and the fat woman actually go to visit her when she makes it big as a showgirl, etc.The most unbelievable part is that Verhoeven didn't set out to create a camp classic - he actually was aiming to make a great drama (his interviews made this quite clear); he took this script SERIOUSLY.

I'm ready for my close-up now, Mr. DeMille. I can't think of any other picture about Hollywood - or the world of film in general - that has achieved this unique self-reflective look at the film community. Ironically, none probably could have dreamed of the magnificent performance Gloria Swanson turned in. At barely 5 feet tall, she commands the screen like no-one else and really towers above them all as Norma Desmond, the aging, completely delusional film star from the silent era. Hard to imagine Gloria Swanson wasn't first choice to play the part of Norma Desmond with Pola Negri (too much Polish accent), Mae Murray, Mary Pickford (too sweet) and even Mae West all considered for the part of Norma Desmond.The movie opens with the bullet-riddled body of a young man floating face down in the pool next to a mansion. Soon, the story is told with the brilliant device of a voice-over of a dead man, Joe Gilis (William Holden), recounting the events leading up to his death. A broke screenwriter, down on his luck and desperate to take on any job, he stumbles upon what looks like a deserted mansion, when he's hounded by some creditors. Soon, he's ordered into the house by a female voice that turns out to belong to legendary silent screen star Norma Desmond who retreated from the outside world, now living a lonely and isolated existence with her aging servant (Erich von Stroheim). After some lamenting the current state of the film industry, she offers Joe a job of doctoring her script for SALOME, which she plans as her comeback vehicle. Clearly this is never gonna happen, but Joe decides to take the job, and he money, but soon becomes a virtual prisoner of the actress's creepy past and increasingly delusional dreamworld.Almost every sentence, remark, Swanson's antiques and postures have become part of our cinematic heritage now, we sometimes forget how delightfully crisp and clever the dialog was at the time, and still is. After the death of Norma Desmond's chimpanzee, Holden acidly remarks; This must have been one important chimp. The grandson of King-Kong perhaps.

Of the three directors featured in the film, Cecil B. DeMille was still well respected and would make some of his greatest films in the years to come. Erich von Stroheim, now degraded to being Desmond's butler, was largely an outcast by then, just as the totally forgotten Buster Keaton who's allowed to play card games at Desmond's mansion once in a while.

Needless to say, he made a whole string of films now considered classics, but this is the pinnacle of his career and head and shoulders above any other self-reflective turn Hollywood embarked on in all the years to follow.

I think Jeff Bridges always gives a good performances and seems to choose those parts which allow him to give a good performance. Sam Elliot as the ultra-pragmatic foul-mouthed chief-of-staff is also hugely watchable, as is the quiet dignity of Joan Allen, the vice-presidential nominee with possible a dark secret. Our very own British Gary Oldman gives equal good value for money as the committee chairman in whom principle shades off into almost pure malice. Tension is also well-sustained to the end, with a plot that has sufficient twists and turns.

While I watched I searched all over for signs that could help reveal this to me. Hidden symbolism of a corrupt and immoral power, purposeful ignorance, even Michael Moore. I could find none of these things. Now I knew it would be difficult considering that the movie was made to pass the conservative censoring that was in place to prevent such criticism from being displayed. I was beginning to think that all the talk of criticism was fabricated by imaginative literature teachers and film critics to make the movie more interesting. After reading others reviews of the movie on the Internet I found that I was not the only one who had difficulty in finding any hidden agenda in the movie. While this made me feel slightly better I knew I had to keep trying to find this movie beneath the movie. It came to me after a second screening of the movie, the title itself is a glaring sarcastic criticism of Iran. Calling Ali and Zhara the Children of Heaven is like naming a movie about modern day Iraq Uneventful Peaceful and Stable Nation. The fact that this name passed censors means that the decision must have been in the hands of a prideful, and arrogant censor.The title was not the only thing that stuck out at me the second time around. Comparing attitudes between the children and adults in the film you could see that the children when faced with a problem took it upon themselves to solve it, while circumventing any adult inclusion. To include their parents in the problem at hand would mean getting beat, and among other things adding to mounting problems. What was interesting was that the parents, unaware of their children's predicament, cared less about rectifying their problems than the children did about rectifying theirs. It is thought to tell if the children recognize this, and are working to become less like their parents to improve their condition in life, or their motivation is purely not to get beaten. Either way this situation opens up some pretty interesting thoughts on how Iran deals with their problems. Are setbacks, and problems the will of god and something that is meant to be, or are they the will of Iran and dealt with only under threat of punishment? Could the younger generations understand that problems are there to fix and pursue rather than mark down as a way of life?Overall I thought the film was very entertaining without the social commentary, and became transformed into a very meaningful, and surprising piece with the commentary.

This time it's yet another dishing served up by the interracial crowd and targeted to poor defenseless teenagers. Julia Stile's character, after the untimely death of her mother is in a state of mourning and confusion of her life. Soon thereafter she is dogged by a black man looking to take advantage of her situation. The movie makers try to suggest he is heroic. His behaviour is nothing short of predatorial. Soon Julia Stiles is engaged in unprotected sex with one of America's greatest risk categories for HIV and other STDs. But this is to be ignored. Apparently if someone, anyone, shows interest in the docile Stiles, they are to be applauded. Or, more appropriately, if anyone is to push a distraught teenager into a interracial relationship they are heroic.The movie follows the pattern of previous interracial propaganda movies such as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and Sayonaro. Anyone that doesn't understand or fully support the relationship is evil and anyone who does is a good person. Tired second rate movie making to be sure. Please turn off your brain when going to this one and act like a cheerleader with an IQ of zero is what the directors require. A father who loves his daughter should never serve her up to a predator and encourage immoral behaviour. Yet, watch and see.Good movie making requires balance and full development of characters.

The editing and framing are done in compliance with Iranian rules about propriety. Men are never shot in the same scene with women that they are not married to or have a family orientation with, but children, as it is allowed by Iranian standards, are shown in any context with each other and any other adult. The pace of the movie is significantly slowed down from the Western motion picture custom and the scenes, as well as the people, are all real. This is to say, that there are no professional actors in the majority of the movie and the scenes are that of real Iranian cities, schools, and homes; there are no sets. The literary elements of the film are dealt with at a unique angle as well. The plot is based on the folly of Ali as it relates to his sister's cherished shoes, a ratty pair of children's shoes, and the pursuit, after they have been lost, of returning those shoes to Zahra Ali's sister. The development of the story is slow but charming, in my opinion, as the journey to the regain the shoes is drawn out over the entirety of the film but treated with specificity while using allegory to point out struggles between traditional and modern day Iran in relation to the government of Iran and its impinges on the citizens therein. The characters and conflict are uncomplicated and delightful, seeing that they are simply about common people dealing with common problems. The real impact of the film is shown in how these common people care for these common blunders that any of us are likely to make; dealing in courageous ways and in observance with honorable means to meet the objectives that each has set forth to accomplish. The social commentary is invisible to the untrained eye, but no less exists clearly within the context of the film to show how each sect of the Iranian society experiences the pleasures and obstacles that are present in modern Iranian life. One such example of this social commentary exists within the relationship of the school principal (symbolizing the government of Iran), Ali's teacher (symbolizing the educated middle class), and Ali himself (symbolizing the lower, working class citizens of Iran). Also, the use of water throughout the movie symbolizes the will of God and is done so with loving consideration, best represented at the end of the movie that closes with Ali's blistered feet resting in a pond (symbolizing that submission to God's will is the best place for anyone and their concern to be). I really enjoyed this film after I understood the context of which the story took place and of what purpose it set out to achieve. Children of Heaven gave me great insight into a society of which I was previously unfamiliar with. I highly recommend the film to anyone who wants to know more about Middle Eastern cultures, especially Iran. In the end, the film points out, rather nicely, the importance of an honorable journey to a principled end while explicating that coming in first, or having the most, are not the most essential pursuits in life. Children of Heaven is a charming story with a profound message that many of us fail to recognize and sometimes all it takes is a simple story about a simple pair of shoes to bring us back.

When anyone asks what it's about, I just say, The Dude.The plot is simple, but well-written. The characters are great, and the dialogue is really nothing short of perfect. This is coupled with star talent used to its fullest potential. There is no one else who could be The Dude, Jeff Bridges just is. John Goodman is hilarious as the short-fused Vietnam vet Walter, and Steve Buscemi plays a different role than usual, but he still is given great moments because the three main characters play off each other so well. The script is endlessly quotable.Now this is not to say that the dialogue and characters alone make the movie funny.

Yet we have the first president and vice-president who were actually arrested before they took office, and the first president who was ever known to have used cocaine. His political strength was gained mostly by calling the other party socialists and communists long enough and loud enough. This movie is about anti-communist insanity.

Reviewing Vincente Minnelli's 1945 masterpiece of impulsive romance, James Agee began, The Clock (MGM) at its best, is so good that it inspires ingratitude for not being great. Agee's lyrical profundity was as entertaining to read as it was astute. In an era before the endless abyss of PR shtick and kiss-ass reviews supplanted the loftier ethics of film-criticism, Agee was the high water mark. Writing for Time and The Nation only seven brief years in the nineteen-forties, he introduced the modern form of criticism still in use, and influenced generations of writers. By 1948, Agee was dividing his time between freelance journalism and screen writing. His 1949 Life magazine cover story, Comedy's Greatest Era, remains among the finest essays ever written on silent film. Agee's genuine admiration of talent, and effusively positive means of expression, resulted in numerous, abiding friendships. Only recently discovered, Agee wrote The Tramp's New World, a post-apocalyptic fantasy, for Charles Chaplin, whom he fearlessly defended during the HUAC lunacy that eventually forced Chaplin from the country. Agee wrote screenplays for two of the most enduring films produced in the nineteen-fifties, The African Queen (1951), and The Night of the Hunter (1955). The latter was directed by Charles Laughton, who lived up to his onerous reputation, and Agee's participation ended in his acrimonious departure. Laughton claimed (after Agee's unfortunate death at 45) that little of the writer's work survived in the final version of the film. The Night of the Hunter would later be considered a groundbreaking film, through its use of minimalist production design, unforgettable performances (Lillian Gish, Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters), and resonating moral message. Agee was far more successful collaborating with director John Huston on The African Queen. The film garnered several Oscar nominations, including best screenplay, and won for best actor (Humphrey Bogart). Huston and Agee, who became great friends, shared screen writing duties in the adaptation of C. S. Forester's novel. What remains clear today is the brilliance and insight with which Agee presented film analysis in a thoughtful, entertaining and informative manner, and the magic of his words on the printed page. His aspirations as a screenwriter, while depriving readers of his film criticism, were understandable given his immense talent, though unfortunate, considering his abbreviated life. Directed by ... The son of an itinerate stage actor and a newspaper correspondent, John Huston was a sickly child, dividing his time between divorced parents, bouncing from boarding school to fleabag hotel room. He became amateur lightweight boxing champion of California in his teens, and by twenty-one a lieutenant in the Mexican Cavalry. While in Mexico Huston wrote a book, it was published, and he leveraged this early success into a Hollywood screen writing contract, which eventually led to directing. His origins explain Huston's affinity for great writers. Throughout his career he collaborated with Truman Capote, James Agee, Arthur Miller, and developed films based on the works of Kipling, Melville, Joyce, and many others. Huston made his directing debut in spectacular fashion with The Maltese Falcon (1941). During his World War II military service, Huston directed a documentary account of the Battle for San Pietro (1945), depicting the conflict with such jarring reality Army censors cut it to half its original length. Even then the film evoked such a strong anti-war sentiment it remained unseen until years later. Huston's greatest success brought him two Oscars and a plumb role for his aging father Walter, as the crotchety prospector in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948). Starring Huston's favorite actor, Humphrey Bogart, it was their fourth of eight films together. Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no stinking badges! Key Largo (1948) later that year was a tour-de-force for claustrophobic gangster Edward G. Robinson, with an all-star cast, again featuring Bogart, Laurel Bacall, and Lionel Barrymore. Claire Trevor won an Oscar for her portrayal of Gaye Dawn, a pathetic, over-the-hill, alcoholic gun moll. The Asphalt Jungle (1950), based on a novel by W. R.

Forester, The African Queen (1951) is the story of two irascible misfits, thrown together by adversity, forced to reconcile their considerable differences for the sake of justice and survival, who inexplicably end up falling in love. Set in Africa as the first World War begins, German troops destroy the missionary outpost of Reverend Samuel Sayer (Robert Morley) and his sister Rose (Katherine Hepburn). Their only contact with civilization is Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart), the seedy pilot of their supply boat. When Charlie finds Rose in the burnt out settlement after her brother has died, he takes her on board to avoid capture, and what begins as a plan to simply 'hide' becomes a mission of heroism. Charlie suffers Rose's starchy spinsterhood, while Rose comes to terms with Charlie's crude, slovenly behavior and drunkenness, as their humorous journey reaches its harrowing and memorable conclusion. Rarely do combinations of story, production and talent line up with results as wonderful as The African Queen. Two of Hollywood's finest actors, well into middle age, were perfectly cast as disparaged, alien opposites, with utterly hysterical and ultimately sweet results. Directed by an emerging Hollywood master, photographed by a stalwart of British Cinema (Jack Cardiff), adapted from the novel by a genius of film commentary and screen writing (James Agee), the enduring popularity of The African Queen fifty years on confirms why this film's place in American culture is as certain as water is wet.

Rather, Hitchcock set out with the soul intention of creating a film to muster American Pride, a certain call-to-arms, support-our-troops title which was a popular theme of the time. With that in mind, Hitchcock severely underplayed other important aspects of the film, including but not limited to a logical plot, characterization, believable dialog, and a fluent, running storyline. Typically Hitchcock does great with espionage films, only a few years earlier achieving cinematic greatness with The Foreign Corespondant and The 39 Steps, but seemingly lost his stride in creating Saboteur and merely recycled the same once-thrilling story lines both his previous excursions readily provided. Without going into any great depth here is a list of a few of this films major problems 1. Despite having his face plastered on every newspaper across America, the only person who recognizes Kane is blind.2. At the dinner party, Kane and Patricia don't want to run for the door because the bad guys might grab them and tell the party they were gate crashers. Logically, what prevents the spies from grabbing them and saying this at any point during the evening? Besides, does anyone need to be reminded Kane is a wanted terrorist?3. Since when can a fan belt cut through handcuffs? 4. Nobody recognizes him...his face is on EVERY NEWSPAPER!!! 5. The spies catch up with Kane in the ghost town and assume he's the man Freeman sent to work with them...shouldn't't he have some sort of credentials? I know spies don't run around with name tags and photo IDs but a secret handshake maybe? 6. Cop picks up Kane escaping from Freeman's house, still seems no one recognizes this guy.7. How exactly does the FBI come to believe Kane with no evidence? They don't even show Kane talking to the FBI, the scene simply fades in and we are forced to assume everything is now kosher.8. When the cops search the Carnival Caravan how do they know Kane is now with a woman? The blind man believed Kane's story thus logically would not have reported his daughter missing, kidnapped, or even more importantly running with Kane. Why does this movie not employ logic?This is a running list. The movie is not exciting, the plot makes no sense, and the world is full of people who willingly take wanted terrorists into their homes and cars everyday because its no big thing. Hitchcock fails miserably on this one.
