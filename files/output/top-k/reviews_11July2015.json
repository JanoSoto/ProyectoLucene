However, for a modern romantic comedy this one hits the spot. It alters the means of communication between the mismatched couple to email from letters. This film has Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) as the heir to a Borders-like bookstore empire whose family is opening a new store near his pen pal Kathleen Kelly's (Meg Ryan) small children's' bookstore. It is the same as its predecessor in that the pen pals actually know each other and do not like each other. It alters the basis of the disagreement to be that of Fox's big impersonal business delivering goods at a discount with the price being a largely anonymous and unknowledgeable retail staff versus Kelly's personal service and first editions that carries a large price tag for the paying customers. It turns out that, even in Manhattan, people prefer to buy discount with the result being the end of Kathleen's store. The movie keeps things interesting with several little side stories and unanswered questions. Did Joe's grandfather ever date Kathleen's mother? Did Kathleen's employee Birdie (Jean Stapleton) have an affair with Francisco Franco in her youth? Why and how did Birdie decide to buy all of that Intel stock? Then there is the whole issue of Joe's serially monogamous dad (Dabney Coleman) that plays out quite humorously and the fact that Joe has an aunt that is thirty years younger than he is. Considering Joe's mother had to be a victim of his father's philandering at some point, Joe seems to take his dad's personal habits quite casually. A very moving addition to this version of the story is Kathleen's identification of the store with her mother to the point that, when the store does finally close, she considers it to be much like her mother dying all over again.The only thing that really bothered me was the issue of Joe and Kathleen seeking other relationships while seriously involved with other people to the point of living with them and not letting on that there was anything amiss. This seemed a bit underhanded on both their parts and somewhat undermined their likability, at least to me.Now I wrote the paragraphs above several years ago. The technology was relevant to the year it was made -1997. Of course today, everybody would be texting one another, and Joe's bookstore would probably be just as extinct as Kathleen's since Amazon managed to put not just the independent bookstores out of business, but big brick and mortar chains like Border's. Of course, that is not the point of the film. The point is love finding two people who on the surface seem completely mismatched in every way, and who, on top of that, are competitors.

The sound effects were hokie, the graphics were poorly rendered, and all of the creatures were real men and women in rubber suits not CGI. But that was not the point. The point was that HERE was a force of pure evil - The Empire - that everybody could be completely against. The heroes were imperfect yet you could rally around them. You have a young boy of about 19 who is treated well by his farming aunt and uncle but wants a bigger destiny, you have an old man living in the hills like a hermit that wants that young boy to join the fight against the empire, and not until The Empire touches the boy personally does he make a rather hasty decision to do so. There is a girl, a princess, who is not waiting for somebody to come rescue her and helpless. She's tough, she can handle a weapon, and she can handle the fourth in their little band, Han Solo, who sticks his neck out for nobody a la Casablanca's Rick Blaine and seems completely mercenary, yet he gets involved. If you like science fiction and good old fashioned adventure you'll like it. If you are young and feel that your destiny is slipping through your fingers and are itching to make a difference, or if you are older and want a chance to right a wrong that you feel at least partially responsible for you'll love it.

Other than that its business as usual for a third time accept for the fact that the Bandit is no longer with us on this road trip. Yep for this third movie Reynolds has flown the coop leaving Gleason to hold the fort on his lonesome. The only other returning cast member is Reed as the old Snowman.The plot once again sees the ultra rich Enos duo offering a wager to (this time) Sheriff Buford T. Justice. The rather pointless aim this time is to transport a large stuffed fish on their car, from Florida to Texas, within the time limit. Why a stuffed fish? well it makes no difference really, its just a stupid visual gag. So Justice accepts the wager and drives off with his dim witted son played again by Mike Henry. The little twist or gimmick in this story is after the Enos duo fail to slow down Buford on his new quest, they attempt to hire the Bandit to help them. But as we know Reynolds isn't in this movie so instead they have to opt for the Snowman for assistance.This entire idea is somewhat tired really it must be said. The original movie was a great slice of hokey, Dixie bound tomfoolery with a cool car. The second was an utter shameless rehash of the first which literately didn't even bother to try and be remotely different, accept for the cargo it was virtually identical. Now with this they have turned the tables and tried a new angle by making Buford the mule, which I must give small kudos too. Alas they still can't escape the lure of the original flicks plot and simply have to make the movie into another big chase sequence. Unfortunately that small element of originality with Buford goes out the window, the reason being the Snowman manages to slow Buford down by stealing the large stuffed fish on his car. Buford needs this stuffed fish to win the wager. Thusly this once again sees Buford on the chase, after the Snowman and the large stuffed fish. The twist concept of Buford being chased doesn't last long I'm afraid. Heck even Cledus the Snowman manages to pick up a female sidekick in virtually the same fashion as the Bandit did way back in the first movie. It appears that these movie characters have requirements, Buford always chases and the protagonist always has a female sidekick...and drives a Trans Am.I don't actually know what Buford is in his police attire for this really, he is on the brink of retirement and once again is completely out of his jurisdiction the whole time. I understand being a police officer in a police car would have its advantages in high speed chases but he's out of his jurisdiction! In America you can tell that easily from the car model, colour, body wrap layout and of course the badge on the side. It doesn't matter of course because we all know its just for the movie, Buford has to be in his police garb, with his son, driving a wrecked police car, otherwise its not Buford T. justice.I think we all know what to expect with this movie by now. There isn't much time to blink without possibly missing something as the entire movie is literately one big chase and crash sequence after another. There is very little actual plot or character building going in between the chaos. We see one chase and crash, Buford suffering some kind of humiliation and his car getting more beat up as it goes, then move on the next chase and crash. The slapstick and pratfalls are on a grand scale with this one, perhaps even more so than before, where as the stunts are pretty predictable really, you can see what's gonna happen the second the scene starts. They even throw in some motorboat chases this time, just to mix it up a bit...a tiny bit.On the whole its more like watching banger\/stock car racing on the streets, the mayhem is through the roof with gravity defying, unrealistic nonsense that is impressive in an odd way (gotta admire the stunt work). Its not really funny though, more childish and insane than anything, kids might like it but geez...even 'The Dukes of Hazzard' and 'Knight Rider' are more realistic. Put simply, it kinda works better than the second movie because they try something different, but it still doesn't work entirely because there is no Reynolds as the Bandit and Reed is no leading man. The Snowman on his own just doesn't hit the mark even if he is driving the famous black Trans Am Firebird.Definitely only for people who like these specific late 70's\/80's madcap car chase genre movies. If you like to spot all the old cars, pickup trucks and big rigs, whilst seeing a good old crunch up with solid stunts etc...well you know already this is the movie for you. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 July 2015","score":"","review":" Why is this sequel called 'Part 3'? beats me, sounds strange really, like an old fashioned tale.

It doesn't matter of course because we all know its just for the movie, Buford has to be in his police garb, with his son, driving a wrecked police car, otherwise its not Buford T. justice.I think we all know what to expect with this movie by now. There isn't much time to blink without possibly missing something as the entire movie is literately one big chase and crash sequence after another. There is very little actual plot or character building going in between the chaos. We see one chase and crash, Buford suffering some kind of humiliation and his car getting more beat up as it goes, then move on the next chase and crash. The slapstick and pratfalls are on a grand scale with this one, perhaps even more so than before, where as the stunts are pretty predictable really, you can see what's gonna happen the second the scene starts. They even throw in some motorboat chases this time, just to mix it up a bit...a tiny bit.On the whole its more like watching banger\/stock car racing on the streets, the mayhem is through the roof with gravity defying, unrealistic nonsense that is impressive in an odd way (gotta admire the stunt work). Its not really funny though, more childish and insane than anything, kids might like it but geez...even 'The Dukes of Hazzard' and 'Knight Rider' are more realistic. Put simply, it kinda works better than the second movie because they try something different, but it still doesn't work entirely because there is no Reynolds as the Bandit and Reed is no leading man. The Snowman on his own just doesn't hit the mark even if he is driving the famous black Trans Am Firebird.Definitely only for people who like these specific late 70's\/80's madcap car chase genre movies. If you like to spot all the old cars, pickup trucks and big rigs, whilst seeing a good old crunch up with solid stunts etc...well you know already this is the movie for you. 5\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"11 July 2015","score":"","review":" Ill be honest, i didn't have much enthusiasm for this movie, not that i didn't like it, but just that i hadn't seen it, and the premise didn't really interest me. of course, that was 5 years ago, and ever since then, i decided to watch it. i acquired it, but kept putting it off for time. then my best friend strongly recommended it to me and i decided to give It a go. i had the exact same reaction as when i watched Frozen. i didn't mind it very much the first time. i fell i missed something so i watch it a 2nd time. i watch it about 4 more times and i adore it almost as much as Frozen.

Vertigo is no exception here and Hitchcock creates a movie full of suspense and a kind of eerie feel to it, with a plot that flows very nicely until the very end. Slow in parts and maybe not recommended for all, this is still acted very well and the technical aspects are spot on. Is it a masterpiece?, well I will say here why I don't think it is but though, why it is still a great film to view.The story is all about an ex detective, who finds out he has extreme fear of heights and has to track and old friends wife, unique right and done well too, brilliantly put out there onto the big screen. James Stewart stars and does very well, his calm composure and firm personality make him likable but at times very strange and importantly, mysterious. Kim Novak is also fine in this and her portrayal is also mysterious and she is really the kind of eerie but interesting plot point in this movie.Alfred Hitchcock directs this in a way which is very well done, a kind of slow feel that gradually builds up to the finer moments of the film and makes this movie what it is. It is written well, I didn't think it was fantastic but it is pretty good, it is of course actually an adaptation of The Living and the Dead and the writers(Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor) make this very interesting and done well too of course.Now is it the greatest movie of all time?, well for me no but I do highly rate it, just not as high as some others. The reason I can't claim this is the best is because it just isn't enjoyable enough, sure it is engaging but the plot gets kind of thin by the end. I think also it very slow, I mean it can have it's fast moments but some moments are just too slow moving, for me the last half starts to slightly drag but it holds itself together to finish off in it's own unique style.I think a reason many do like it so much, is the depth which I won't deny is there and makes this one heck of an interesting flick. It's the level of acting also coupled with that in depth storyline that make this great, not perfect but pretty excellent. I think Hitchcock knows what is best for this and goes straight for it, he seems to mix the elements finely and it feels as if he put a lot of personal style into this, making it more realistic and less like typical Hollywood made movies. I think the visuals and the camera work make this stand out even more in the history of film, and definitely in the era in which it was made. With finely used camera techniques this becomes a different level for the day, Robert Burks makes this just perfect homework for any budding cinematographer and how to manipulate the cameras view. The score is also a fine one, not great but well done, makes the suspense much more thrilling and the story just a little more engaging. So all in all this for me isn't the very best, but doesn't surprise me why some love it so much, just in this day is it really as important as before?, I'll leave that for anyone out there who wants to answer that. In any case this is a very good movie though and I would recommend it to anyone, and especially to those who call themselves film fans.

No, believe it or not, this features the best effects of any movie before 1970. The effects are so excellent that the people who did Robinson Crusoe on Mars stole these space ships. They show little beams that hold the ships in the air magnetically, very well done. Watch this cast convey fear versus the newer bad actors. It contains one of the scariest scenes in any movie. I will not spoil it for you just get ready to see popcorn go flying all around your living room. The remake, wisely, did not even try to mimic it. It will seem a little corny and phony with the square dance, and the community activities but it really was like that. When I was growing up, it was a world of parks, activities and communities, just like it is depicted here. They wiped it all out before I could really be a part of it. Watch, compared to Independence Day, how no time is spent trying to communicate with them. In Independence Day, even after they wipe out half the country, the president is still trying to cut a deal. Like all science fictions from the 50s, with the exception of the Space Children, we lock and load. Some people get offended at the priest getting burned up, hey, these are stand ins for the godless Commies. That scene was necessary to relay to the audience, that the enemy is always godless and ruthless. It will seem so odd, like Earth Versus The Flying Saucers, how we start firing with no attempt to negotiate. Find a movie of this genre in the 50s where we did. It has some really creepy parts in it. The movie is quite short which is a good thing. It gets going and never stops until the ending. There is a hiding out in the farmhouse scene but that is why the director put the scariest scene in there; you think it is boring then BAM!, he scares the crap out of you. Acting is important in horror or science fiction because the premise is so far fetched we need believability out of the actors. This cast will not let you down. I know, there is an intentionally funny part with the radio guy freaking everybody out about the invaders. Look, there are always parts like this in old movies, try not to notice. It is not as funny as Dr. Marvin putting that alien helmet on in Earth Versus The Flying Saucers. A Great Movie, the best the 50s had to offer with Forbidden Planet.

The movie is quite short which is a good thing. It gets going and never stops until the ending. There is a hiding out in the farmhouse scene but that is why the director put the scariest scene in there; you think it is boring then BAM!, he scares the crap out of you. Acting is important in horror or science fiction because the premise is so far fetched we need believability out of the actors. This cast will not let you down. I know, there is an intentionally funny part with the radio guy freaking everybody out about the invaders. Look, there are always parts like this in old movies, try not to notice.

Even Sylvia is a better actress than anyone in the remake. Many younger people may avoid this film because they are going to be afraid the effects will stink. No, believe it or not, this features the best effects of any movie before 1970. The effects are so excellent that the people who did Robinson Crusoe on Mars stole these space ships. They show little beams that hold the ships in the air magnetically, very well done. Watch this cast convey fear versus the newer bad actors. It contains one of the scariest scenes in any movie. I will not spoil it for you just get ready to see popcorn go flying all around your living room. The remake, wisely, did not even try to mimic it.

The plot as said is like a cat chasing a mouse, expect the mouse is a human in New Orleans and the cat or cats should I say are the very rich paying to chase them down. A unique take on an action movie but so unrefreshing that I can't give it credit for having uniqueness here.The director I mentioned is John Woo who's first ever American movie is actually well done, but only from him. With a poor script and acting and a plot that does hardly any favours, this is one movie where I feel kind of bad for Woo. He as I say does it nicely, he seems to know what he wants from the actors but they don't pay him back, the villains of the show are the real star actors with Lance Henriksen and Arnold Vosloo being the best, not great for the bad guys to outshine the good.I'll give the film credit where it's due, and it deserves it in terms of the stunts and choreography it has, Van Damme does excel with his high leg kicks and powerful head smashes, but don't worry, the violence isn't too crazy for those who dislike it.

It's the kind of movie that I have come to expect though I mean there aren't many action thrillers similar to this that actually turn out good, even the best of them are usually only average.

Supposedly a meteor lands in the Arizona desert near a small town, but in fact it is a space ship carrying an alien race quite repulsive to humans. With a smart script that questions our inability to wait before pulling out our guns and firing, and telling us that the aliens aren't always a threat to humankind, It Came from Outer Space tried to provoke our thoughts away from believing that those from outside our world land here to hurt us. Richard Carlson is kind of a B-movie icon for many of us, mainly due to his association with Creature from the Black Lagoon and this film. He is the lone scientist (a star gazer in this film, considered by the papers who mock his claim that it was a space ship that landed in the desert, not a meteor as suspected) who tries to speak for the aliens, hoping to convince the sheriff (Charles Drake) that using guns won't solve anything except perhaps hurt those taken captive by them in order to use their likenesses in town to secure hardware needed to fix their vessel (and produce a weapon to protect themselves). With Barbara Rush as Carlson's love interest (and eventually kidnapped herself, naturally), and Russell Johnson (of Gilligan's Island fame) as the employee of an electrician (Joe Sawyer) in the cast, this is actually a respected sci-fi film, not relegated to the cheesy conversation of many of its ilk. There are some imaginative first-person perspective shots seen through the eye of the alien as it descends upon and spy on humans. The special effects aren't the bright spot of this one its budget is obviously low as the alien is a rubbery monstrosity that could have been made by Paul Blaisdell, and the ship is basically a ball (probably inflatable). I always find myself engaged in the presentation, though, as it has that Invasion of Body Snatchers meets Day the Earth Stood Still feel to it. Carlson was always reliable and interesting, and he conveys the frustrations\/dismay of being dismissed for his claims of the spaceship\/alien presence, conflicted, agonizing anxiety at if he should believe in what the race of aliens are telling him regarding peaceful non-threatening motives on earth (just repairs and accidental crash on the planet, not willing to confront the earthlings due to our shoot first, ask later response to beings unlike us), and struggle to maintain a posse led by the sheriff when it appears the townsfolk are being kidnapped and possibly in harm's way. The setting in Arizona (actually shot in California) is quite refreshing (THEM also has that, as does Arnold's own Tarantula), and it is used expansively. One good scene I like has Joe's electrician listening to strange noise through the power lines with Carlson getting an ear of it, commenting on how the desert has its own voice. The Joshua tree even gets a good bit of ooga-booga use as Rush screams when it is shadowed in darkness, as she believes it is the alien. The zombie-like movements of alien clones of the human locals is quite pod-like, and the simple small town rural sense of place within the enveloping desert landscape does create a bit of perfect cover for aliens needing to get their ship in order&#x85;or else.

Alex Browning (played by Devon Sawa), a high school senior is on his way on a week-long field trip with his French class to Paris. Shortly upon boarding the plane, Alex has a horrifying vision of the plane exploding. Plagued with paranoia, Alex panics and rushes off the plane, with seven others removed off board. Much to everyone's shock, Alex's nightmare comes true when the plane unexpectedly explodes upon takeoff, killing everyone on board. The survivors off board include Alex's best friend Todd (Chad E. Donella), his arch-rival Carter (Kerr Smith), Carter's girlfriend Terri (Amanda Detmer), orphaned girl Clear (Ali Larter), tag-along student Billy (Seann William Scott), and their teacher Mrs. Lewton (Kristen Cloke). While many become grief- stricken by their losses, Alex discovers that death is still after them when the survivors who originally escaped their demise begin dying in freak accidents.Final Destination was definitely one of the most original horror films Hollywood has it offer. This isn't a typical horror movie. Instead of a blade-wielding killer in a mask, girls possessed by evil spirits, or people being attacked by monstrous creatures; this film deals with the killer being death itself. The concept involves teenagers who escape a deadly plane explosion and begin dying in really unusual accidents.

It tells the whole story from Uther Pendragon getting the sword from Merlin and faithfully tells the well-known tale through to the return of the sword from whence it came. It has lots of parallels with the Disney's Sword in the Stone including a Merlin and a fish scene (no songs like to and for, to and fro, that's what makes the world go round) but similar philosophies are mentioned and the morality of the story is not lost.The sets, design, wardrobe and scenery are perfect for the film - historians might disagree. Stunning and reminiscent of the old historical\/Biblical epics and I love the way that Wardrobe put a modern and beautiful slant on the clothes, especially the ladies (see Knights Tale for a more up to date version of similar clothing). Many of the stunts were very good, special effects fair for the time and for an early 80s film it tried to be as real as possible showing some quite graphic (for the time) sex scenes and nudity. The Direction was definitely mature and Boorman clearly had a very vivid image in his mind and this was clearly a labour of love but sadly much of what he tried to do looks naive now (2015)The major - but only - fault with this film, and it's a big one, is the acting. Everyone shouts, over-acts or is reading-from-script- wooden and Merlin can't decide whether he's a comedy schlock-fest of funny voices or a dark and foreboding apparition who's voice sends shivers down the spine. No-one acts sensibly and there's a glut of big names so you'd expect better; Helen Mirren, Gabriel Byrne, Clive Swift, Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, Cherie Lunghi to name a few. The acting is so bad it turns a dramatic, sinister, historical (sort of) narrative into laugh out loud comedy but for bad reasons not good ones. A few times during the film I felt I was watching a bad school production on stage and couldn't believe how amateur it seemed. Perhaps Merlin (Nicol Williamson) was supposed to be the plucky comic relief or perhaps it is just a very dated film, and hammy was what he was asked to do. It did very well for gongs and so clearly was well received at the time. Watching it forty years on, for the first time, however, it hasn't aged well but is still a terrific film in terms of spectacle and if you love untampered retelling of the legendary Arthurian tale you'll love it despite its flaws.

In a way, I feel bad that modern day viewers don't have the same perspective for having missed the experience.With my most recent viewing of the film, I was paying attention to things I'd just recently read in the Marshall Terrill biography, Steve McQueen, The Life and Legend of a Hollywood Icon. McQueen, who had been released from his Four Star TV contract filming the hit series Wanted Dead or Alive, was extremely competitive and did anything he could to draw viewer attention from the movie's principal star Yul Brynner. If you'll notice, he did things like shake his shotgun shells, flip a coin, fuss with his Stetson, tug his bandana and whistle through his teeth, all seemingly natural as part of his character, but manufactured on the set to upstage Brynner, who got very agitated over it. McQueen's goal, which he eventually achieved, was to become as big or even bigger movie star than Brynner or anyone else for that matter.The best part of the movie for me is in the early going when Chris (Brynner) and Vin (McQueen) are putting the band of seven together to go up against Mexican bandit Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his outlaw bunch. Especially cool was the knife challenge called by cowboy Wallace (Robert J. Wilke) against the laid back Britt (James Coburn). A classic example of someone pushing too hard and just too long before he gets his comeuppance.

This is a well-staged and intense opening that does well in presenting just how dangerous Scaramanga is. It gives us some tension and action straight away which is always a good way to open, just a shame we don't get any sign of Bond.Theme Song Lulu's title track is one of the worst in the series. The tune is totally lacklustre and the lyrics are terrible, with innuendos about guns and powerful weapons. Lulu's scratchy off-key vocals only succeed in making everything sound even worse than it already is.Plot Bond is informed that the world's most expensive assassin Scaramanga has made him his next target and Bond decides to hunt him down. During this Bond becomes embroiled in the hunt for a missing solar energy harnesser that Scaramanga has links to. The plot with Bond going off again someone as dangerous as himself is set-up solidly, but it is still a let-down. It should have been seen as an intense battle between the two and made to feel more important than it is here. The solar energy device is clearly just tagged on to give Bond more to do and feels completely unnecessary.James Bond Roger Moore goes against his usual portrayal for a more hard-edged approach and it doesn't really work. With such a foe a tougher turn makes sense, yet Moore isn't very convincing in the scenes where he acts tough and in other he acts so calm that you doubt he's even worried. He is still as debonair as ever, but he just isn't that much fun to watch.Bond Girls Britt Ekland makes great eye candy but she is truly woeful as Goodnight. She just plays the role like a stereotypical ditzy blonde and it's not remotely believable that she's an agent. She looks dumbfounded throughout and delivers some already bad lines horribly. Maud Adams is simply okay as Scaramanga's mistress Anders. She certainly shows the desperateness of the character, but she isn't given anything that interesting to say or do.Villains Christopher Lee pretty much saves the film as the confident Scaramanga. Lee brings his usual touch of class and dignity to the role, really selling the idea that Scaramanga is Bond's equal. Lee just has a magnetic screen presence and his scenes are easily the most interesting. Dwarf actor Herve V is charming and rather amusing as butler\/henchman Nick Nack. It is certainly a unique villain, but he simply isn't a convincing threat.Support Clifton James returns as sheriff Pepper and really isn't used well here. There is no need for him to feature, the jokes are painful and his mugging for the camera quickly wears thin. Soon-Tek Oh is pretty good as Bond's ally Hip and Bernard Lee is great again with more screen time than usual.Action The action scenes are pretty bland. Kung-Fu is featured which is fun and gives us something different, but then we get Hip's nieces beating up an entire dojo which makes a mockery of the area. We do a get a pretty cool fight scene over a gold bullet and a well shot car chase through Bangkok, but that's the only good stuff. The final confrontation is such a let-down and has none of the tension required, whilst watching Bond 'fight' Nick Nack is both awkward and ridiculous. We also get a truly incredible stunt with a car leaping a bridge, which is then totally ruined by having slide whistle sound effect over the top of it. Score John Barry's score is just decent here. To be fair there is nothing that good on screen for him to enhance, but the music feels a little rushed. There is nothing here that fits into the film or sounds catchy and it's by far Barry's weakest work on the series.Production Values Visually there is nothing special here, this is pretty much the most average looking Bond film you'll see. Hamilton has shown before he has a good eye for shots, but he clearly isn't on top form for this one and it shows. Bangkok is quite a good location and lends itself perfectly to the exotic adventures that Bond goes on, while the private island that Scaramanga uses does look beautiful. The production design is lacklustre with a lot of the sets looking like they are from the 1960's and most of them being bland, even if we do get a couple of good ones like the hidden headquarters in a ship. The pacing and editing is also very uneven, as at times things seem to be flying along and at others it feels like it's unnecessarily slow. The writing is again weak, apart from a couple of Scaramanga's lines I can't recall any of it and most of the humour feels very forced. Conclusion Golden Gun is one of the weakest films in the series. Almost nothing seems to work here and there are a lot of bad choices made. Christopher Lee is the only standout by making a classy and compelling villain. As said Moore is iffy at best here, Ekland is terrible, the action is weak and there just isn't anything interesting on screen most of the time. The writing is very poor, there is no need for such broad humour or numerous goofy moments in what really should be a very grounded film. Overall though this feels like a wasted opportunity, a lot of the ingredients were there for an exciting Bond film and what we get is one that has to drag itself to a finish.

During this Bond becomes embroiled in the hunt for a missing solar energy harnesser that Scaramanga has links to. The plot with Bond going off again someone as dangerous as himself is set-up solidly, but it is still a let-down. It should have been seen as an intense battle between the two and made to feel more important than it is here. The solar energy device is clearly just tagged on to give Bond more to do and feels completely unnecessary.James Bond Roger Moore goes against his usual portrayal for a more hard-edged approach and it doesn't really work. With such a foe a tougher turn makes sense, yet Moore isn't very convincing in the scenes where he acts tough and in other he acts so calm that you doubt he's even worried. He is still as debonair as ever, but he just isn't that much fun to watch.Bond Girls Britt Ekland makes great eye candy but she is truly woeful as Goodnight. She just plays the role like a stereotypical ditzy blonde and it's not remotely believable that she's an agent. She looks dumbfounded throughout and delivers some already bad lines horribly. Maud Adams is simply okay as Scaramanga's mistress Anders. She certainly shows the desperateness of the character, but she isn't given anything that interesting to say or do.Villains Christopher Lee pretty much saves the film as the confident Scaramanga. Lee brings his usual touch of class and dignity to the role, really selling the idea that Scaramanga is Bond's equal. Lee just has a magnetic screen presence and his scenes are easily the most interesting. Dwarf actor Herve V is charming and rather amusing as butler\/henchman Nick Nack. It is certainly a unique villain, but he simply isn't a convincing threat.Support Clifton James returns as sheriff Pepper and really isn't used well here. There is no need for him to feature, the jokes are painful and his mugging for the camera quickly wears thin. Soon-Tek Oh is pretty good as Bond's ally Hip and Bernard Lee is great again with more screen time than usual.Action The action scenes are pretty bland. Kung-Fu is featured which is fun and gives us something different, but then we get Hip's nieces beating up an entire dojo which makes a mockery of the area. We do a get a pretty cool fight scene over a gold bullet and a well shot car chase through Bangkok, but that's the only good stuff. The final confrontation is such a let-down and has none of the tension required, whilst watching Bond 'fight' Nick Nack is both awkward and ridiculous. We also get a truly incredible stunt with a car leaping a bridge, which is then totally ruined by having slide whistle sound effect over the top of it. Score John Barry's score is just decent here. To be fair there is nothing that good on screen for him to enhance, but the music feels a little rushed. There is nothing here that fits into the film or sounds catchy and it's by far Barry's weakest work on the series.Production Values Visually there is nothing special here, this is pretty much the most average looking Bond film you'll see. Hamilton has shown before he has a good eye for shots, but he clearly isn't on top form for this one and it shows. Bangkok is quite a good location and lends itself perfectly to the exotic adventures that Bond goes on, while the private island that Scaramanga uses does look beautiful. The production design is lacklustre with a lot of the sets looking like they are from the 1960's and most of them being bland, even if we do get a couple of good ones like the hidden headquarters in a ship. The pacing and editing is also very uneven, as at times things seem to be flying along and at others it feels like it's unnecessarily slow. The writing is again weak, apart from a couple of Scaramanga's lines I can't recall any of it and most of the humour feels very forced. Conclusion Golden Gun is one of the weakest films in the series. Almost nothing seems to work here and there are a lot of bad choices made. Christopher Lee is the only standout by making a classy and compelling villain. As said Moore is iffy at best here, Ekland is terrible, the action is weak and there just isn't anything interesting on screen most of the time. The writing is very poor, there is no need for such broad humour or numerous goofy moments in what really should be a very grounded film. Overall though this feels like a wasted opportunity, a lot of the ingredients were there for an exciting Bond film and what we get is one that has to drag itself to a finish.

Continuing the theme of France's national motto (liberty, equality, fraternity), Trois couleurs Blanc (Three Colors White in English) looks at equality, as a divorced man returns to his native Poland and eventually decides to get even with his ex-wife.As in the first installment, Kieślowski uses the title color to tell the story. This color that is a combination of all the other colors appears in almost every scene. White continues the first movie's theme of trying to break away from the past, while there remains an object serving as a link to the past. Blue had the blue beads, while this one has the two-franc coin. In the end, one might interpret the man's ethically questionable business practices as a warning about going overboard in reforming Poland's economy after the Soviet-backed regime collapsed.I actually didn't find White to be quite as good as Blue (I have yet to see Red). The previous one focused on the woman's attempts to make a new life for herself, while this one makes the man look like the victim. Not that these turn it into a bad movie.

They give Mike and Sullivan just the right touch of love-hate friendship, though I thought Mike went just a little overboard with his over-zealousness and frustration. And, the portrayal of the little girl was cute and innocent, but I thought was too annoying as the five year-old who runs into trouble all the time and displays just about every bad quality of a misbehaving child moaning, crying and being mischievous in every possible way.

Whenever I'm feeling down I watch it and will be laughing out loud fairly soon. It certainly bears repeat viewing. Thing is opinion is divided about this sort of comedy. On the face of it, this film is about a parasitic woman who prostitutes herself for gain and takes over the lives of all those who come anywhere near her, leaving chaos in her wake. How it manages to be comedy is the genius of the Writer Stan Seidel and Director Harald Zwart. Think Tarrantino's gem or a film True Romance and dial up the silly and you have One Night at McCool's.Liv Tyler and Matt Dillon are great - when aren't they? Paul Reiser and John Goodman are superb and play up the hammy really well. Perhaps poor reviews are by people who didn't get the jokes, realise it was deliberately silly or just don't appreciate that sort of humour. Not everyone does and that's fine. Every character is warped in some way... every character is shown as flawed but remarkably still likable. Cleverly shot from three points of view, telling three - or four - different stories is is a climactic hoot.Tyler is absolutely stunning in this. It's lovely to see a totally sexy woman who isn't a stick and it must have been so much fun to play Jewel with all the silly clothes, get-ups and fun scenes. No- one in this film takes themselves seriously and out of everyone I think Matt Dillon is the only one playing it straight amongst all the craziness. Saying anything about the plot will give too much away but I just have to say that if you don't LOL at the final scenes, I think you might need medical attention.
