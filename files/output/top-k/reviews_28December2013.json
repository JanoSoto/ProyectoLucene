[{"date":"28 December 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Ed Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey) is an everyday guy with a loser video clerk job. TV producer Cynthia Topping (Ellen DeGeneres) wants to do a 24\/7 reality show for a failing cable network. They choose to do the show with Ed. His brother Ray (Woody Harrelson) is a bit of a douche. Ray breaks his girlfriend Shari's (Jenna Elfman) heart, and she falls for Ed.If there isn't the gimmick of a TV show, this would be a simple rom-com between McConaughey and Elfman. However, the movie is too simplistic about what a camera following somebody all the time would actually mean. This feels like a Hollywood movie of a Hollywood TV show of a Hollywood reality.Director Ron Howard doesn't actually do edgy that well. It's definitely not his forte. And this movie needs to get down and dirty, but Howard's light touch fails him here. After an interesting start, it quickly gets boring. It's a speed bump in an otherwise great directing career. The sad thing is that it's so obvious that Howard is not up to this job.

Come on, Jeff Goldblum, Geena Davis (in her only good role), Joseph Bologna, Ed Begley Jr., the incomparable Carol Kane... how does it get any better? Oh, right, it does; the theme song. The fabulous Pennsylvania 6-5000 by Glenn Miller in 1940. Hey, that's my ringtone. And, by the way, that's a real phone number... it is the (translate to modern numbering) the Hotel Pennsylvania in NYC. So there. In any case, this is really classic slapstick, and it has so many references to other works you can watch it many times and still find new ones. Dang, I think I'll watch it again now.
