Later, visions of action figures on TV commercials dominated my Saturday mornings. This sure was a completely giant success story that even I couldn't understand way back in my pre-school years, but it was just happening. It took years of waiting experience to get a new VCR, and I finally took advantage of the Force. If you were like me, your early childhood days have been rough because you never got to see the STAR WARS trilogy. Fascinated by flying spaceships, bold warriors, and especially C-3PO and R2-D2, the days were a joy to behold. George Lucas' sci-fi epic that includes this first original movie is a timeless treasure, thanks to his establishment of a fantasy adventure that goes galactic. He's not just an ordinary director, but a director of technology. The excitement of its epic combat battles are worth infinite viewings, and was destined to blow away the audience with a rapid-fire force of impact. And this revolutionary piece led to numerous imitators!You can very well remember how George Lucas and the whole ILM gang made this trilogy through its history of complications. The original STAR WARS was a terrible undertaking for Lucas because he wanted a movie that feels true to realistic. When JAWS was playing in 1975, it showed off some new special effects technology of a great white shark, and managed to achieve in editing. That hit film was released at a time when production values remained tight, which they were often called B movies. STAR WARS has been the same thing, and it wasn't exactly clear that high-quality visuals would ever be possible. It would take more than the entire National Football League to create a 70s masterpiece. Lucas tried, and won by displaying a thrilling speed of action with a lightning fast pace. One example is the brief hyperwarp scene, where one blink of an eye ruins your day. When you have an incredible view of the fireworks, there's always a big plot to make more excitement. Like the movies themselves, one good story leads to another.Without characters, there wouldn't be a movie at all. Make them appealing and then everyone can enjoy the fun. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) lives the adventure; Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is always the bold type; Chewbacca The Wookiee adds to the chemistry with his furry appearance; likeable droids C-3PO and R2-D2 are loved by the kids. But there's always the villain, Darth Vader whose familiarity would still be hated through fun, but always recognizable. This first installment actually serves as an introductory platform for the characters and their potential of things to come. We know them well, but this is only the beginning (in Episode four!). Keep in mind, though, that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has always been the central hero of the series. Pretty fascinating!Always take notice of the 1997 Special Edition. This is a mandatory must for STAR WARS newcomers who still haven't taken advantage of the Force in all these years. The myth is that there aren't a whole lot of changes. The truth is that they're saying quite a lot because the editing of these enhancements is phenomenal, and hasn't been done before. It's a remarkable achievement in modern film technology, and the scene with Jabba The Hut explains why. Remember that some of original pieces of footage remain the same with a certainty of noticeable glitches, which is still a minor offense. Add to this some incredible restoration and we still have a sci-fi gem that will stick around longer while the new trilogy slowly builds on. Think of this, you're watching an entirely new movie!I hope this original movie and the whole trilogy in itself doesn't fall victim to a terrible amount of backlash when EPISODE ONE arrives. That one will do excellent business based on our cravings for special effects; they actually sell the movies! Should it happen, this would be a fatal blow to preserving a quality image to American cinema, past or present. We must take for granted that movies are essential as entertainment, and how the many possibilities can be discovered. Judging a movie's popularity against the odds is only going to hurt it. It is currently being demonstrated with E.T. (1982) and TITANIC (1997), two highly acclaimed films that are receiving tons of negative criticism and scrutiny from the public. They do this by pushing popularity off the wall. At least we know how to handle STAR WARS movies carefully, and while we enjoy science fiction as a make-believe cushion, it's important to know that it took a genius like George Lucas to create a universe where excitement exceeds the imaginable.

I love it. It ranks very high on my all-time best list.Pacino has (rightfully) received two-and-a-half decades of accolades for his role as Sonny, the loser bank robber without the wit to hold up a Dunkin' Donuts, let alone a bank. Pacino may have won his Oscar for Scent of a Woman, but this is the role he will be remembered for.But there are two key points to this film that often go overlooked. The first is John Cazale as Sal. Slow-witted and along for the ride, he is just as prepared to kill anyone who moves as he is to take a nap. Cazale was a gifted actor who only made five films before his untimely death - all five were best picture nominees and three of them won. This rivals his roles as Fredo for his best work.(Nods also go to Chris Sarandon and Charles Durning for their crucial supporting roles).The other fascinating point about this movie is its simplicity.

The selfish generations have these days shifted film way beyond the happily ever after plot lines our screen lovers often inhabited in previous generations.Now families and mortgages have given way to second or third marriages coupled enthusiastically with cynicism.The progressive destruction of the nuclear family has been well and truly reflected in popular entertainment.So could you expect Sandra Bullock (Speed, Time To Kill, The Net) and Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting, Shakespeare In Love) to be romantic clean skins in Forces Of Nature?Well actually Ben (Affleck) is giving it a go. He's on his way from New York to be married in Savannah to Bridget (Maura Tierney). On the way he encounters a series of natural and unnatural forces which throw him together with the effervescent and much more worldly Sarah (Sandra Bullock).Will Ben throw over Bridget for Sarah and how funny will the process be? These after all are the questions we attend these films to answer.Well Forces Of Nature is very funny once or twice but it's real value is its knowing observations on the institution of marriage. Ben is repeatedly confronted by the failure of the unions he observes while he's on the road to his own marriage.The message isn't savage but it is persuasive. He meets an deliriously happy elderly couple who he then finds out are having an affair after years of misery with their previous partners. His parents squabble and Sarah is hardly an advertisement for happy unions.But Forces Of Nature isn't maudlin, it's often very humourous and it's lifted by the relationship between Ben and Sarah which I found charming and believable even as the Forces Of Nature affecting their relationship become increasingly bizarre. (There's even a hurricane!)It's been a long wait for a fetching film from Sandra Bullock. Speed was a huge success but her career has been largely a mess since then. But her Sarah is amusing and multifaceted, as is the more dour Ben from Ben Affleck.Forces Of Nature mixed the improbable with the likeable in an intelligent way and is well worth a visit. And for once it would seem that we have one up on American viewers of an American film.Apparently a great deal of license has been taken with one or two geographical locations in the film, a bit akin for Australians to setting a film in Melbourne and then transplanting the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Port Phillip Bay.This upset some Americans but we Aussies couldn't give a damn, could we.

And although this movie has compressed numerous events of her life into a few short years, and some liberties have been taken, this film is more akin to The Godfather saga than an episode of Masterpiece Theater. Cate Blanchett-who should have won the Best Actress Oscar-is incredible as the woman I consider the Woman of the Millennium intelligent, brilliant, sometimes uncertain, and offering herself as sacrifice to her nation. Geoffrey Rush is outstanding as Francis Walsingham, one of her ministers, who will offer life and limb to protect his Queen.

The movie is a barely disguised Keystone Cops adventure which might have been slightly more interesting if it weren't for truly different and interesting films that have already been made like Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Fifth Element.I suspect the masses will enjoy this movie in large numbers because it seems most are programmed to like movies that have expensive trailers, computer-generated special effects and enormous budgets...the current defining principles of Hollywood.

A  just-for-fun type of movie that you will enjoy if you let yourself.
