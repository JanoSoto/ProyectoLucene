[{"date":"29 September 2006","score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" RUN LOLA RUN is one of those films that actually delivers what it promises. In this case, a heart-pumping, action-filled flick with an excellent soundtrack, and plenty of artistic weirdness to boot.Clocking in at a mere 80 minutes, this German-made film is infused with a quality normally seen in the cars this country produces. Tom Tykwer wrote the script and directs (as well as contributing his voice and music to several songs\/remixes), and gives us a movie that contains more than just artsy material. He takes the viewer on a journey of existentialism thanks to the unusual abilities of its main character, Lola. She's a dye-dipped redhead with a high-pitched, soprano voice that can shatter glass. And she has the ability to change her future. Problem is, though, every time she changes something, everything changes, not just the one thing she wants. So when her boyfriend, Manni, loses 100,000 Deutsche marks that are owed to a local mob boss, Lola has to save him. But she's only got 20 minutes, and everything doesn't go as planned ...the first time. Or the second. Or maybe even the third.Not being very familiar with German cinema, I'd rarely watched anything from this country. But I'd often heard people comment on Run Lola Run and how great it was, so I decided to check it out. And I'm glad I did! The film opens up with a bang and doesn't stop until the final scene. Franka Potente stars as the hair-color-enhanced Lola, and her portrayal is believable, beautiful, and bizarre. In short, a great combination. Her boyfriend, Manni, is played by Moritz Bleibtreu, and his ridiculous behavior is pulled off well, especially when he loses the money and calls Lola in a blubbering panic.I loved, too, the incorporation of overlapping animation, something I enjoyed in the movie THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS.Connections within connections is the main theme here, but one that is brought to life by a vivid script and excellent camera work (the dizzying slow-downs and speed-ups may drive some to distraction but are vital to the story).I mentioned earlier the great soundtrack and that the director contributed his own voice and songs to it. And so did Franka Potente. The European beats mixed with old American titles were laid down in topnotch fashion.This is another foreign film gem, and one that won't take up much of your time. But it's one you'll be glad you visited.

This is a funny and entertaining movie throughout. There is little not to find great. I think the best scene, however, may been the Red's Bar scene, where Grodin pretends to be an FBI agent. Grodin is very good as a Felix Ungerlike accountant, who is on the run from the mob. He is a very unlikely person to be doing so. He is very fussy and he clashes with Deniro (Jack Walsh), who is a former-cop bounty hunter whose only two emotions are silence and rage. There is a cross-country chase also involving a rival bounty hunter, two bails bondsmen, an FBI agent (Yaphet Kotto), Dennis Farina as a mob boss, and two of his henchmen. Both Grodin's and De Niro's characters end up learning a lot about each other. That is really what the movie is about. In the end, they end up helping each other out.

I knew of no previous films he had directed, or any films that he had been involved in. First warning sign.Secondly, to me, it just doesn't finish the trio of movies off very well. We all would expect a finale to be grand and epic, action-packed,final battle of good v evil, and Return of the Jedi just does not deliver for me. No to my liking anyway. Sure, it's got plenty of action, but by the end I don't really get a feeling of completeness, of resolution.The third little niggle; since when can Stormtroopers be knocked out with rocks and killed with wooden arrows? The armour they wear should be far more developed than that, and in my view of the Star Wars universe, it's just not realistic.And since when does a Stormtrooper run after someone who tapped them on the back? they'd simply pull out their blaster and shoot them. Again, unrealistic. And what purpose do the Ewoks serve, apart from standing there, looking 'cute'? Also, in one or two places, the quality of the acting could have been improved. I'm not trying to sound cynical, I'm just giving you my opinion. Trust me, if George Lucas would have directed this, it could have been a lot better.
