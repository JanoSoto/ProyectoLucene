Watching a movie this good makes us wonder why Hollywood puts out such crappy family movies that no one likes (for example, last fall's Old Dogs, which while unseen by me, was attacked by critics with viciousness unseen by anything other than a Uwe Boll movie). Whatever the reason, Shrek is a hysterical send-up of fairy tales (and just about everything else you could think of). And it's oddly touching.Shrek (Mike Meyers) is a grumpy ogre who lives alone, and that's the way he likes it. Unfortunately, one day a bunch of fairytale creatures move in...and they won't leave. After a series of hilarious plot conventions and send-ups involving a petite wanna-be king named Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), Shrek has to go and rescue a princess (Cameron Diaz) from a castle (in which, of course, a fire-breathing dragon has taken up residence) if he wants his swamp back.Shrek gave birth to the never ending series of movies where the sources of comedy where potshots at pop culture, famous movies, and what not (one could argue that Scary Movie, which came out a year before, opened the door, but this film was more successful). As tired as the spoof genre became, there's a reason why it became so successful this movie is flat-out funny! While Shrek is infamous for its jabs at Disney movies, they're not the only things in the film's cross-hairs. Everything from reality TV to theme parks is skewered mercilessly, and nothing escapes the film's grasp. What's especially funny is that it's entirely suitable for all members of the family (though some of the very young may not get a few of the jokes).The voice talents are perfectly chosen. Mike Meyers is perfect as the title character, mixing grumpiness with vulnerability, and with more than a shadow of self-doubt. Even though Meyers makes the role his own after taking it over from Chris Farley after Farley's death, Meyers still keeps a little bit of Farley's trademark energy. Eddie Murphy is hilarious as Donkey, who's mouth rarely stops moving. He may not be the brightest bulb in the bunch, but he sure is funny. Cameron Diaz is no stranger to comedy, and that suits her well here as the princes that is not what anyone thinks. She's a feisty loaded pistol who's read a few too many fairy tales. John Lithgow may be the least famous member of the cast, but he's still hilarious as the arrogant (and tiny) Faarquad.Directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson keep the tone light and fun, but with an air of mischief. They also take the time to create superlative visual effects. The animation is gorgeous and varied, realistic, but still cartoony. However, sometimes the lip movements noticeably don't match up to the words (like sometimes they start slightly before the words come out).Hilarious, but with a heart, Shrek is a movie for the whole family to enjoy again and again.

The film tells the rather unsettling story of an insomnia stricken man, played by Edward Norton. His life changed one day when he meets a mysterious soap maker named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and, after his apartment room is blown up along with all of his belongings and the little that remains of his personal life, they became inspired to co-create a seedy underground club in which men are invited to attend and to pummel on each other to their heart's content as a form of physical therapy as well as an advanced form of personal male-bonding. Things get complex when a female drifter named Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who inadvertently gets involved in the mentally deteriorated world that these two men share. Things only get worse when Tyler decides to take the club out onto the streets and then into their homes and into the lives of more political and respected people.As technically talented as Fincher is, what I admire most about the film is how he doesn't let the visuals tell the story. The sarcastic, bitter, angry narration of Edward Norton that plays over the events helps a lot in driving the atmosphere of the film into it's audience, but it also adds to the humor of the film. Is the film a satire? Yes. Then why the sly, cool tone, the clever dialogue, and the slick visuals? Well, to me it all seemed very forced and over-the-top. Nobody in the real world talks like these characters, and it seems pretty obvious that the film is self-aware. You can tell in the sarcastic narration. I think that people may likely forget that we're watching the story unfold from the perspective of someone who is obviously crazy. Every person in this film is crazy in one way or another. What makes the film so bizarre is the fact the thoughts of the main character make sense in the sense that they have rationale to them. The physical appearance of the main character slowly grows worse and worse while the characters around him grow more positive, more open-minded, and more like he was at the start. What makes this so funny is the fact that the methods these characters use to make themselves happier are so completely irrational and ridiculous. Not to ruin the plot, but when it comes to illegal acts of vandalism involving public property being destroyed, there comes a point where politics don't seem so important in retrospect since we live in such an interesting and advanced time in the world today.Looking at this film ten years later, it still has just as much power as it did in 1999 or 2000 or whenever it was when people decided to start watching it. As I said before, David Fincher is a technical talent. His films often hold an incredible amount of visual energy, and Fight Club is no different. The performances are excellent. Edward Norton's performance here is one of his best, as is Helena Bonham Carter. As for Brad Pitt, he does exactly what the role requires from him and kudos to his for being such a good sport for being in this film. The music in this film works equally as well. It's very dirty, industrial, and overbearing, much like the film itself. The film just has a tremendous spirit, though I can't say that I actually enjoy watching it. It's full of blood and guts from beginning to end, it's often very ugly to look at, and the film feels a little too dirty in that way that makes you want to shower. This is also a very very homo-erotic film, not just in the fight scenes but also in the way the male characters act around and toward each other. I can't say that I'm anywhere near as infatuated with it as I was when I was in high school, where any film that tried new things seemed revolutionary and brilliant, and just as well, this film makes it very difficult to take Brad Pitt seriously in most of his other films. The fight scenes in this film are also excellently choreographed and the gore effects in these scenes are wonderfully done. The final shot of the film may, at once, be considered by some to be an amazing and rebellious shot, but I laugh just thinking about it due to another very brief image in one frame of the shot that occurs just as the credits are appearing.So overall, Fight Club is still an entertaining film. It's funny, it's dark, and it provides a very honest depiction of mental illness that very few films have the balls to explore. The film has developed a strange cult following, reminiscent of the cult audience surrounding American Psycho. These people seem to feel that these two films contain deep philosophical messages about the nature of humanity, but they definitely don't. I don't think the characters in Fight Club should be taken completely seriously and I'm astounded that anyone even could take them seriously. It's like saying that Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon was right to rob the bank and that the police were all wrong. Both sides made mistakes and both sides learned things, but that doesn't change the finale of the film. If you're going to watch Fight Club, please don't try to watch it with an open-mind about the characters and the things that they say. Watch it knowing everything that you know now about politics, science, religion, and humanity. I'm sure that the film will have the desired effect on you.

If anyone can prove the auteur theory it is him, for every single film he makes is of his own, unique vision that separates him from the rest of Hollywood. With the Terminator films, Titanic and The Abyss, he shows his full-out talent as one of the premier entertaining directors of the last 30 years. Considered to be his most arduous and challenging shoot, The Abyss plays like a National Geographic documentary showing footage of divers underwater. The scope and scale of Cameron's vision here is tremendous; almost every shot begs the question, how did he do it? Yet, compelling as that footage is, it doesn't begin to scratch the surface of what a deeply involving experience this movie is. Though his dialogue comes off as corny or amateurish at times, his storytelling ability is unparalleled. He creates a complex plot-line, sometimes to the point of over-stuffing the amount of content the audience can take. He introduces one thread, than another, than another, than pushes them all together until we are overwhelmed, but not confused. It really is quite a head-trip, but it is so well-made that very few other films could succeed as this one does. As with most Cameron films, the director's cut is almost assuredly superior to the original. Certainly the extra footage is not totally necessary to the central plot, but it gives more evidence to account for the incredible scale and detail he puts in every single one of his productions. The acting also contributes the riveting action taking place; Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are quite good as exes forced together and the supporting cast also really helps bring the audience into this world. Not enough can be said of Cameron's incredible vision. For that reason alone, practically every film he's made is worth seeing. Unfortunately with this one, the ending suffers quite a bit. For the first 2 1\/2 hours, I cannot think of many other films more engrossing and riveting than The Abyss. However, the final scene seems almost forced and tacked on. Cameron essentially opened up for a number of different possibilities here and took the easy way. Had he created a more compelling finale, this might be his unsung masterpiece. Despite this quibble, there is no doubt this is a unique film by a unique director. You know you're in the hands of a master when all you can think about while watching the movie is how the heck did he do it.

A group of people are gathered some place for one reason or another, and are picked off one by one by some deadly foe. But there are a number of differences that separate this science fiction horror classic from your average slasher movie an unbearably intense atmosphere and what is easily the most frightening creature ever to grace the silver screen.A group of workers on a space mining ship Nostromo get a strange signal from a nearby planet. When they go out to investigate, something strange happens...Of course, after over thirty years, it's probably safe to assume that anyone who is on the Internet Movie Database and reading one of the thousands of reviews of this classic has seen this movie, but because I don't feel that I have to go into any more detail, I won't. That being said, if you are reading this and actually HAVEN'T seen this movie, go and see it...primarily because you're going to get a classic freakout that few, if any movies can give you, but also because it's almost a sin for any movie lover to live with the fact that they haven't seen this movie.This is more akin to movies like Halloween than Star Wars (two VERY different movies that came out within a year of each other), so like the John Carpenter classic, the acting rules that govern films like Star Wars or The Godfather do not apply. Nevertheless, it introduces us to the most famous action heroine, Ellen Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver. She's effective in the role, but there's no time or need for her to do anything else. Likewise, better known character actors Tom Skeritt, Ian Holm and John Hurt do the same. Lesser known actors Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright and Yaphet Kotto stay in their league. What's especially nice is that each individual is unique (though not three dimensional), which is something of a rarity in these kinds of movies.There are two names that are responsible for most of the film's successes H.R. Geiger and especially director Ridley Scott. Geiger, whose night terrors provided the inspiration for the Alien, deserves much credit. There is no other being that I can imagine that is more frightening than the Alien in this film. It's large, slimy, and extremely deadly.But while Geiger created the creature, it was up to director Ridley Scott to create the atmosphere in which its potential for terror could be reached.

But one of my favorite things they do is ask which movies I haven't seen and try to stump me, which my boyfriend did the other day with Stripes. I was a bit confused because I thought it was a movie I would have seen but never did. So he bought the movie and we watched it, from what he was describing, I was expecting one of the funniest comedies. After all it has Bill Murray, Harold Ramis and John Candy, some of the funniest actors of all time. But honestly I wasn't all that impressed, not to put the movie down, it does have some funny moments. Bill and Harold have excellent chemistry and make for great best friends on screen. John Candy is always a pleasure to watch and honestly I think that he stole the movie, he is just one of the most lovable actors in history and naturally you can't help but adore him. I watched his biography the other day and apparently the mud wrestling scene was very uncomfortable with him because of his weight, but he did it anyways just for the laughs and that's what makes him so wonderful, he is willing to do anything to put a smile on a person's face. But as wonderful as his presence is, Stripes is still over rated.John Winger is a slacker in his late 20s who experiences the worst day of his life as, in the span of just a few hours, he quits his job, his car is repossessed, he drops his pizza on the street, and his girlfriend dumps him. Realizing that his life is a failure, he decides he needs a new direction. At that moment, a recruiting ad for the U.S. Army plays on the television, and he decides that is just what he needs to get in shape. Talking his best friend Russell into joining, they quickly drive to the nearest recruiting office and are soon off to basic training. Moments after arriving, Winger has already offended their drill sergeant, Sergeant Hulka, and stands out as a misfit throughout basic training. So throughout training, Winger keeps messing up and continues to be a goof as others are punished for his actions. He starts to question if the army really was for him all along or if there is still a strong possibility to over come it all and be an adult.So did I hate the movie? No, I did like it. One of the scenes that I did really enjoy was when Murray finally gets his act together and pulls his troop in for the graduation and shows off. It was well put together and really excited me. I also loved how Murray makes some of the drills into a joke and as they're marching they start singing the do-a-diddee song. There are some memorable moments in the movie that definitely make it worth the watch. But over all I have to say that the script isn't one of those non stop laughs stories. It's one of those movies that I saw once and am more than happy with seeing the one time. So for nostalgic reasons, I would recommend it big time, plus it has an excellent cast that I'm sure you'll love. Though I admit, these were the good ol' days of dirty comedies and didn't apologize about it, I miss those and at least with Stripes I got a little of my traumatic childhood back.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 May 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" If you know me in real life, you'd test me constantly on movie trivia, pretty much all of my friends do.

They brought in a few events and characters from the book to help flesh out the relationships, but for the most part it resembled the book in so few ways I wish they just made the movie and called it something else. The reason that I did give it a 7 was because of James Dean. What an engaging performance. There are so few films of his and this is the only one of his I have seen and I have to say that I am extremely impressed. Just based on this one movie I have never seen anyone else attempt to act like this except maybe Brando in On the Waterfront. I have scene hints of it in Joseph Gordon Levitt in Brick, but there are very few instances where an actor just throws himself into the role with such physicality. The rest of the cast did not blow me away, but Julie Harris was pretty engaging. I respect Kazan for not attempting to put too much of the book in the movie and he actually did a pretty good job of only putting what was needed. The main problem is that this is one of my favorite books and I know all of the characters so well. Dean's Cal was the only character that lived up to expectations and he completely blew me away. I know this type of acting is dead, but I do enjoying seeing it done well. Not a great movie, but I enjoyed it. I think I was engaged with the movie so much because I was interested in seeing how Kazan (and the screenwriter) would approach the material and specific scenes. One thing I do want to mention that I liked was the scene when Cal tells Aaron about their mother. It is wonderfully directed scene and is actually a very long shot with some intense acting from everyone. It was well lit and the camera moved perfectly. The framing of the shot where all you can is Aaron's back and hear Cal talking was really nice I loved how the scene was executed overall.

I have scene hints of it in Joseph Gordon Levitt in Brick, but there are very few instances where an actor just throws himself into the role with such physicality. The rest of the cast did not blow me away, but Julie Harris was pretty engaging. I respect Kazan for not attempting to put too much of the book in the movie and he actually did a pretty good job of only putting what was needed. The main problem is that this is one of my favorite books and I know all of the characters so well. Dean's Cal was the only character that lived up to expectations and he completely blew me away. I know this type of acting is dead, but I do enjoying seeing it done well. Not a great movie, but I enjoyed it. I think I was engaged with the movie so much because I was interested in seeing how Kazan (and the screenwriter) would approach the material and specific scenes. One thing I do want to mention that I liked was the scene when Cal tells Aaron about their mother. It is wonderfully directed scene and is actually a very long shot with some intense acting from everyone. It was well lit and the camera moved perfectly. The framing of the shot where all you can is Aaron's back and hear Cal talking was really nice I loved how the scene was executed overall.

Not that there's anything particularly terrible about that; the trouble is, the problems don't end there.Which is a pity, since it had a good idea and a hell of a cast; just not the right one, unfortunately.Take Gwyneth Paltrow's accent For an American, she does a damn good job of English; the thing is, an English actress would have done so much better. We're also better at dowdy, and this film needed someone who could scrub up well. Ms. P is just too glamorous. Honeysuckle Weeks would have been my choice, but I'm biased.Next, there is the device Used waay too soon (about 3 minutes in, as I recall), so we get no chance to see what GP's life was like before the fateful split and introduce some of the other characters. It also seemed to me they could have used more techniques (split-screen, double exposure or simply quick cuts) to keep the two narratives in sync. There is really only one point where the two halves are brought together before the conclusion.Third The blokes. The script is definitely to blame here, because both Johns are very good actors. Unfortunately, Lynch seemed awfully wimpy for a chap juggling two gorgeous gals; and Hannah comes across as a bit forced. The exception is Douglas McFerran, who was spot on as Russell, and gave me my few genuine laughs of the movie.Fourth Oh dear, Hollywood does like its packages done up with nice pink ribbon doesn't it? Guess I should've been a scriptwriter, because I can think of at least 3 endings that would have been better than the one they chose.All that said, it's not a terrible movie; just not as good as I'd hoped. Look up the definition of a curate's egg and you'll probably find it mentioned -- and if you want to see a better film on a similar theme, check out The Man with Rain in his Shoes (on this side of the pond, it's called If only).6\/10.
