But what can you expect? It's very hard recapturing the magic of something you worked on 20+ years ago. But there was something about this film that seemed to skim some new magic, which the first one didn't.While all the Star Wars films have been relatively light, this film heads into some darker places. Shmi and Anakin, Anakin's scene with the Tusken raiders and about what he did to them all reach into our minds and soul, grab us there, and hold us, staring us straight in the face with a cold look, foreshadowing the inevitable fate of Anakin Skywalker, want-to-be Jedi.Hayden Christenen takes on the role of Anakin this time, and we are placed ten years ahead of the first one. The movie does start out better and the story actually has relevance to the series as a whole (which most of the first one did not, except for Palpatine taking over as Chancellor). Hayden is OK with Anakin; not terrible as most people make him out to be, but not so spectacular that you totally believed he would be Darth Vader only three years later.The script is handled much better this time, but does have its share of faults. The good things include a tight script with a great format and it has much more importance to the future events that will shape the fate of the galaxy. It's not as light and happy as Star Wars I but never crosses into serious adultness. Music once again improves the overall quality of the film and so do the special effects (there were too many special effects, but if they're good, who cares?)

The second one told the story very well, but it got boring at times. The whole mystery surrounding the Sith Lord controlling the Senate was way too much and took much time. Anakin's story was handled well (excpet for the corny and uncomfrotable love scenes), and Christopher Lee and Ewan McGregor were fantastic.This one made up all the mistakes in the first one, but made other mistakes in its place.

As loved as it may (deservedly) be, Clerks is remembered for the crude humor rather than the plot, while Mallrats, which was meant to be a smart, amusing teen movie, turned out to be little more than a vehicle for Jason Lee's comedic talent. Chasing Amy is radically different combining Smith's trademark superb dialogue, believable characters and a heartfelt story, it is one of the best, most insightful romantic comedies of the '90s, and the director's most satisfying picture aside from Clerks I and II.Whereas his first two movies kept referencing other films as soon as there was time to do so, Chasing Amy centers on Smith's second great passion comic-books. In fact, it all begins at a convention, where Banky Edwards (Jason Lee) and Holden MacNeil (Ben Affleck) are signing issues of their successful book Bluntman & Chronic. Afterwards, they hang out with fellow artists Hooper X (Dwight Ewell) and Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), and while Banky spends all of his time arguing with Hooper over the racism in Star Wars (one of the funniest things Smith has ever written) or the gay subtext in Archie comics, something clicks between Holden and Alyssa, and soon enough they start seeing each other almost every day. It is obvious something deeper than friendship is in the air, and they both know it, yet there's a catch Alyssa is a lesbian, or at least she used to be one before meeting Holden. Hence the big question can they have a meaningful relationship with her past being such a huge burden? What kind of sacrifices will have to be made?In another film, the boy-loves-lesbian premise would have been an excuse to deliver a 90-minute marathon of distasteful, gratuitously explicit jokes. Chasing Amy, on the other hand, is good because it really cares for its characters and whatever crudities there may be never feel excessive or out of place, but on the contrary they manage to convey the speaker's emotions more correctly (this is particularly true for Jason Lee's foolproof, energetic performance). The central love story is honest and touching, two characteristics that are evident in the realistic dialogue and acting Adams, who hasn't managed to find a decent role ever since, portrays Alyssa as a human being, not a stereotype, and that's what makes her scenes with Affleck, always at his best when working with Smith, compelling and almost painful to watch.Most of the time, Chasing Amy is a perfect balance between gross-out humor and tender romance, something the director kept toying with on the underrated Jersey Girl (where the jokes were less sweary than usual) and perfected with his masterpiece, Clerks II. There are, however, a few moments when Smith doesn't understand he has to stop and tells us everything about a certain character's personality, whereas he should simply have implied it. Overall, though, this feature remains one of the most hilarious, moving, revealing films of the '90s, with its best moment saved for the director himself halfway through the movie, the mandatory Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith) make their appearance. In all the other View Askew flicks, they are just incredibly funny.

As the Iggy Pop's 'Lust for Life' pounds through your ears it may be difficult to realise at first. Is it this iconic choice of soundtrack? Could it be the pain that you feel along with the actors, who gurn and gasp as they push their way through the streets of Edinburgh? Or could it in fact be the startlingly stirring voice-over provided by Ewan McGregor? Yeah, that would be it, though it is important that you remember something. This is the 1996 Ewan McGregor. Before Star Wars, or Moulin Rouge! and it was well before The Island. This is Ewan McGregor when he had to dive into toilets, and dig bodies. This is Ewan McGregor who didn't have the luxury of multi-million dollar deals or stunt doubles. This is Ewan McGregor who is only a stone's throw from the drug addled character he's playing, and above everything else that shows.One of the many initial criticisms of Trainspotting has been that it seems to be promoting drug use and it doesn't take long to see why. The film starts off startlingly realistically with Renton sneering that he wouldn't do drugs if he didn't enjoy it. With this, we learn at breakneck speed that the world of drug abuse that we've been taught about and steered away from is like any other addiction and that to an extent, we, the average viewer, are no better than these people. So light-hearted is the first quarter of the film, common sense seems to leave and it's not made entirely open why drugs are considered bad in society. But the enjoyable caper that you settle comfortably into doesn't last for long and soon it's apparent that director Danny Boyle is showing the good and the bad; the Heaven and the Hell. Whilst watching Trainspotting you're in junkie limbo.Among the themes of drugs, there are others relating to everyone. A core idea is the Choose Life movement, a phrase repeated throughout the film to perfectly nauseating effect. Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a f**king big television&#133; Both stark and hideously blunt, the truth about conformity in materialism soon sets in to make it apparent that 'choosing life' may well be exactly the opposite. On top of that, in case anybody is worried that they might not be able to relate to Renton's drug issues, addiction on other levels is explored thoroughly. A commentary on how prescription pill popping is just as damning but seen as much less crude by society is but one.Considering that Trainspotting isn't quite an ensemble cast film, it's surprising to what extent most of the main characters are explored. Before the end, qualities, problems, traits and secrets of just about all the major characters are exposed and examined. There is no character that could be accused of being a strict (or even slight) cliché. Naturally, because Renton is an addict, you wouldn't really trust him if he tried to tell you his life story in the pub and so frequently, he is played off as an unreliable narrator. There are numerous times that he exclaims that he will do something, usually get off the heroin, to no avail at all mostly because he simply hasn't the power to do this. At around the 65 minute mark, you really come into a full opinion of who he is and how much control he does (or doesn't) have over himself, his life and his addiction.One of the main reasons Trainspotting excels at being such a disturbing film is that it doesn't back down at the thought of having to push the envelope and employ some abstract ideas in order to truly get a message across. The most effective uses of these are without doubt when juxtaposition is used to take an innocent idea and put it in a horrifyingly grim environment. Not only does this create a spellbinding effect, but Boyle and his crew also raise the bar by taking advantage of these moments to create real suspense.From a technical standpoint, the camera-work and cinematography are fluid, inventive and original. The music is interestingly diverse and always fitting. The story itself is nothing new but is written and executed in such a wild fashion that everything seems fresh rather than recycled. However, you can only go so far on recycled material and as the stakes are raised, the film starts to lose focus of what has throughout, felt like the most core theme of the film. Not drugs, not addiction, but friends. Despite the advertising and the views of the film-makers and the controversy the key idea of friends always being there for one another is what feels like the blood pumping throughout the body of this film to keep it moving and invigorated. After all, with who else would you be able to ramble about the trivial knowledge you've garnered of James Bond over the years, shoot dogs with air rifles, recreate the legendary Beatles album walking across a road or refer to everything via your own personal favoured pop culture?Trainspotting is a film for anyone who wants to take a trip to the dark side but also see the light that keeps people there. It's a film for anyone who's not afraid to cross the line. It's a film for anyone who chooses life.4\/5 (8\/10) ","genre":null},{"date":"29 May 2007","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Chronicling the lives and trends of a group of addicts, Trainspotting is a raw, deep and honest look at the pros, cons and horrors of abusiveness to addiction.As Renton (Ewan McGregor) and Spud (Ewen Bremner) hurl down the street with the energy of a Duracell bunny it's apparent that there's something very powerful about Trainspotting.

Not only does this create a spellbinding effect, but Boyle and his crew also raise the bar by taking advantage of these moments to create real suspense.From a technical standpoint, the camera-work and cinematography are fluid, inventive and original. The music is interestingly diverse and always fitting. The story itself is nothing new but is written and executed in such a wild fashion that everything seems fresh rather than recycled. However, you can only go so far on recycled material and as the stakes are raised, the film starts to lose focus of what has throughout, felt like the most core theme of the film. Not drugs, not addiction, but friends. Despite the advertising and the views of the film-makers and the controversy the key idea of friends always being there for one another is what feels like the blood pumping throughout the body of this film to keep it moving and invigorated. After all, with who else would you be able to ramble about the trivial knowledge you've garnered of James Bond over the years, shoot dogs with air rifles, recreate the legendary Beatles album walking across a road or refer to everything via your own personal favoured pop culture?Trainspotting is a film for anyone who wants to take a trip to the dark side but also see the light that keeps people there.

As the Iggy Pop's 'Lust for Life' pounds through your ears it may be difficult to realise at first. Is it this iconic choice of soundtrack? Could it be the pain that you feel along with the actors, who gurn and gasp as they push their way through the streets of Edinburgh? Or could it in fact be the startlingly stirring voice-over provided by Ewan McGregor? Yeah, that would be it, though it is important that you remember something. This is the 1996 Ewan McGregor. Before Star Wars, or Moulin Rouge! and it was well before The Island. This is Ewan McGregor when he had to dive into toilets, and dig bodies. This is Ewan McGregor who didn't have the luxury of multi-million dollar deals or stunt doubles. This is Ewan McGregor who is only a stone's throw from the drug addled character he's playing, and above everything else that shows.One of the many initial criticisms of Trainspotting has been that it seems to be promoting drug use and it doesn't take long to see why. The film starts off startlingly realistically with Renton sneering that he wouldn't do drugs if he didn't enjoy it. With this, we learn at breakneck speed that the world of drug abuse that we've been taught about and steered away from is like any other addiction and that to an extent, we, the average viewer, are no better than these people. So light-hearted is the first quarter of the film, common sense seems to leave and it's not made entirely open why drugs are considered bad in society. But the enjoyable caper that you settle comfortably into doesn't last for long and soon it's apparent that director Danny Boyle is showing the good and the bad; the Heaven and the Hell. Whilst watching Trainspotting you're in junkie limbo.Among the themes of drugs, there are others relating to everyone. A core idea is the Choose Life movement, a phrase repeated throughout the film to perfectly nauseating effect. Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a f**king big television&#133; Both stark and hideously blunt, the truth about conformity in materialism soon sets in to make it apparent that 'choosing life' may well be exactly the opposite. On top of that, in case anybody is worried that they might not be able to relate to Renton's drug issues, addiction on other levels is explored thoroughly. A commentary on how prescription pill popping is just as damning but seen as much less crude by society is but one.Considering that Trainspotting isn't quite an ensemble cast film, it's surprising to what extent most of the main characters are explored. Before the end, qualities, problems, traits and secrets of just about all the major characters are exposed and examined. There is no character that could be accused of being a strict (or even slight) cliché. Naturally, because Renton is an addict, you wouldn't really trust him if he tried to tell you his life story in the pub and so frequently, he is played off as an unreliable narrator. There are numerous times that he exclaims that he will do something, usually get off the heroin, to no avail at all mostly because he simply hasn't the power to do this. At around the 65 minute mark, you really come into a full opinion of who he is and how much control he does (or doesn't) have over himself, his life and his addiction.One of the main reasons Trainspotting excels at being such a disturbing film is that it doesn't back down at the thought of having to push the envelope and employ some abstract ideas in order to truly get a message across.

Tarnell, Herb Vigran.....Director Richard Fleischer...Screenplay Earl Felton.Leave it to Walt Disney to be the first to make a film based on Jules Verne's 1ate 19th century classic fantasy adventure novel 20K Leagues under the Sea. It was produced by Buena Vista Studios, which was the studio owned by Disney where only his animated films had been made (Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia, Cinderella). This was Disney's first non-animated, live-action film, but he opted to stay behind the scenes and allowed Richard Fleischer to direct. Fleischer cast three well-known, A-list actors for the principal roles. James Mason stars as Captain Nemo, the reclusive idealist sea captain who commands the crew of the Nautilus, his powerful luxury-submarine. Kirk Douglas stars as the bold, self-centered and spirited sailor Ned Land, an older, fatter Peter Lorre stars as Conseil, the man-servant to French professor Arronax played by Paul Lukas. The Jules Verne novel is a lot more complex but this film attempts to provide this adventure film with a kind of prophetic vision of the future and sends a message about mankind's hopes and dreams for a better world. The character of Captain Nemo was Verne's favorite and appeared in other books such as The Mysterious Island. 20K Leagues recounts his final days. Captain Nemo has isolated himself from the rest of the world in order to live under the sea and make the blueprint for an ideal future society. He prefers the peaceful life under the boundless sea to the world above full of war, disease and violence. It's 1868 and America has just come out of the Civil War. Rumors of a deadly sea monster that has been destroying ships have fascinated the world and Professor Arronax who desires to seek the truth. Together with his man-servant and a group of sailors they head out to the South Seas. But soon Captain Nemo sinks the ship and takes up the survivors as his newest crew members. Here, the adventure begins. Before long, Ned becomes greedy for the treasures hidden by Nemo. Their journey takes them to various locations, including an island inhabited by cannibals. In the end, it becomes necessary to destroy the Nautilus and Captain Nemo himself, for fear that rather than helping humanity, he might endanger it. Disney may not have used animation but he did make great use of various special effects. The most famous of these is the animatronic squid which attacks the Nautilus. This scene is set underwater during a powerful storm and became so popular that Disney even made a Disneyland attraction ride out of it. Filmed in Cinemascope and with splendid cinematography by Franz Planer, the film is real winner. But if the actors don't do anything for you, then surely the look of the film will. Most of it is filmed under the sea, brimming with beautiful glowing fish and danger and this during the early 50's when audiences did not see much of it on film. The original music by Paul Smith is dramatic and gorgeous. Kirk Douglas was becoming a major Hollywood star at the time but in this film, he appears to be in it for publicity. He appears shirtless, plays a guitar, lusts for gold and women and is basically just doing his macho thing which he did for other roles at the time. Peter Lorre is wonderfully comedic as always, despite his age. The real strenght here is James Mason's portrayal of Nemo. For Disney, this film was purely experimental. He knew it would either make him or break him. It was a triumphant success of course but thanks not only to the lead actors but to the visual effects. After this, Disney felt confident enough to produce countless other live-action films. For so many reasons, this film was ahead of its time and is a film that can easily be appreciated and enjoyed by fans of Disney and the novel by Jules Verne.

The film contains some mild violence, namely in fight sequences among the sailors and crew members, explosions and some horror (the squid). The dialogue and the story was never meant for children bur rather for adults and that must have been obvious to film-goers familiar with Jules Verne. All in all, a great film.

Michael Douglas's career really took off in the 80's (Wall Street, Fatal Attraction) and there is genuine chemistry with Kathleen Turner in this film, the first of subsequent films they would do together (Jewel of the Nile, War Of The Roses). Set in New York City, Joan Wilder (Turner) is a romantic novelist looking to write the one big novel that will make her or break her. Pressured by her publisher and friend Gloria (Holland Taylor) she begins work on a new novel but she's interrupted by the shocking news of her sister's abduction in Columbia, where she is being held hostage for a ransom. Joan's apartment is broken into and a mysterious treasure map arrives via postal package. Before long, she goes to Columbia to save her sister and embarks on a dangerous adventure with a priceless emerald involved. She's joined by bad boy Jack Colton (Douglas) who dreams of buying a ship and sailing around the world. Danny DeVito, a well-known star by this point, appears for comic relief as Ralph and would again reprise the role for the film's sequel Jewel of the Nile. For some reason, his casting is a success for he is funny, smart-alecky and the kinda guy you don't want to hate because he is so much like someone we know. His chemistry with Douglas and Turner also lend itself to the success of the later film War of the Roses. The success of Romancing The Stone owes to its timing. In '84, adventure films were invading mainstream American film. By this time people were eating up the Indiana Jones films, and this film is similar in its adventure theme. The film differs from the Indiana Jones film in that this is also more of a romantic comedy. Though there are bad guys, the heroes are flawed and governed by personal passions. The original music is by Alan Silvestri, who would compose many other Hollywood film scores and the cinematography is glorious - excellent vistas of the jungle and high mountains of Columbia where the film was shot. The film is not based on any book or comic-book but rather was an original screenplay, the work of many writers. The sequel Jewel of the Nile is absolutely inferior to this great film and was made simply to cater to fans. If you love adventure, good comedy and romance, this film is for you. At the time, it was also a date film and can still be a date film. This is feel-good movie, a movie movie and to this date people still enjoy that kind of thing, especially because it's a type of film that is non-existent in our present day.

Danny DeVito, a well-known star by this point, appears for comic relief as Ralph and would again reprise the role for the film's sequel Jewel of the Nile. For some reason, his casting is a success for he is funny, smart-alecky and the kinda guy you don't want to hate because he is so much like someone we know. His chemistry with Douglas and Turner also lend itself to the success of the later film War of the Roses. The success of Romancing The Stone owes to its timing. In '84, adventure films were invading mainstream American film. By this time people were eating up the Indiana Jones films, and this film is similar in its adventure theme. The film differs from the Indiana Jones film in that this is also more of a romantic comedy. Though there are bad guys, the heroes are flawed and governed by personal passions. The original music is by Alan Silvestri, who would compose many other Hollywood film scores and the cinematography is glorious - excellent vistas of the jungle and high mountains of Columbia where the film was shot. The film is not based on any book or comic-book but rather was an original screenplay, the work of many writers. The sequel Jewel of the Nile is absolutely inferior to this great film and was made simply to cater to fans. If you love adventure, good comedy and romance, this film is for you. At the time, it was also a date film and can still be a date film. This is feel-good movie, a movie movie and to this date people still enjoy that kind of thing, especially because it's a type of film that is non-existent in our present day.

Michael Douglas's career really took off in the 80's (Wall Street, Fatal Attraction) and there is genuine chemistry with Kathleen Turner in this film, the first of subsequent films they would do together (Jewel of the Nile, War Of The Roses). Set in New York City, Joan Wilder (Turner) is a romantic novelist looking to write the one big novel that will make her or break her. Pressured by her publisher and friend Gloria (Holland Taylor) she begins work on a new novel but she's interrupted by the shocking news of her sister's abduction in Columbia, where she is being held hostage for a ransom. Joan's apartment is broken into and a mysterious treasure map arrives via postal package. Before long, she goes to Columbia to save her sister and embarks on a dangerous adventure with a priceless emerald involved. She's joined by bad boy Jack Colton (Douglas) who dreams of buying a ship and sailing around the world.

His life's motto is definitely love 'em and leave 'em and have fun in between. So, when he meets Charlotte (Winona Ryder), a beautiful young lady half his age, he is surprised at how smitten he is with her. Wanting to make a connection, he hires her to make a hat for his date to a charity function. When she shows up at his apartment on the evening of the affair, he informs her that his date is sick. Would she, Charlotte, take her place? She agrees and they have a lovely evening together, one that lasts all night. Love is in the air, all right. But, Charlotte confides in Will that she has a dire medical condition, one that is threatening her life. What will their future hold? This is really a nice film for those who like to sigh and cry over a set of star-crossed lovers. Gere is great as the aging lothario and Ryder positively enchanting as the spunky and lovely young lady in his life. The rest of the cast members, including Anthony LaPaglia, Sherry Stringfield, and Elaine Stritch, are great. Then, too, the film is replete with lovely costumes, sets and scenery, making for a very beautiful watch. If you have a hankering for romances, even and especially ones that elicit tears, you should get this film without delay. On an autumn evening, with a fire blazing and mugs of hot chocolate on hand, you will feel very satisfied when the story is spent.
