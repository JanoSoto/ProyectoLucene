When I read the description for it, I realized that this was a movie I simply had to watch to decide myself. But I didn't really go out on a great quest to find it. I just thought about it sometimes. Had I seen it in the stores I would have rented it, or bought it. But I never did. So one day, my sister came home with a bunch of horror movies she had rented, and one of them happened to be Ravenous. I decided to watch it, but I wasn't overly excited about it.When I started it up, however, it soon struck me This is one of the few movies that had ever kept me on the edge of my seat. All the time.The story follows an officer in the American-Mexican war. In 1847, Boyd is promoted to captain due to heroics in combat. However, a colonel realizes that it wasn't actually heroices, it was cowardice that opened up the opportunity that presented itself to Boyd. After Boyd's promotion, the Colonel sends Boyd as far away as possible To Fort Spencer somewhere in Califorina. A drop-by point for travelers on their way to Sierra Nevada. It is in the middle of the winter, and the landscape is covered with snow. Add to that, the fort has only eight inhabitants, including Boyd, and is almost completely isolated from the outside world.One dark night, a stranger finds his way to the fort. He is in very bad shape and they take him in to give him food and such. Once the stranger wakes up, he tells them that his name is Colqhoun, and is a servant of god. He then tells them his tale. It's a terrifying tale about how Colqhouns caravan was lost in the mountains, and forced to seek shelter in a cave. This is where the horror starts, as it appears one in Colqhouns company has an undying thirst for human flesh.I won't tell you anything else of the story, other than that it's fantastic. In fact, it was so bizarre, twisted, original and amazing that first I thought it must have been an adapted screenplay from some horror novel. I checked it out, and no; It was an original piece by Ted Griffin. Any man who could conceive a story like this is simply marvelous. But it's not all thanks to him, as the director Antonia Bird has finetuned the story with his own direction and such. The soundtrack is chilling and eerie. It's nothing like I've ever heard before. The atmosphere is among the best I've ever experienced. I dare to say, that this is in fact the best horror film I have ever seen. If you're a fan of movies, you owe it to yourself to immediately go and get a copy of this film. Don't make my mistake. Don't wait. Go see it now.10\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"23 May 2004","score":"","review":"  Many of my friends, both online and off, had spoken of this movie, Ravenous. Some liked it, while some hated it.

It's been several years since I saw it last time. I worried that I may not like it as much as I used to...I should not have worried - I love it even more now if that is at all possible. I've seen it at different times of my life - first, as a college student many years ago in Moscow; I keep returning to it all my life.When Tarkovsky's Zerkalo (The Mirror) was first released, it divided the audience completely. I remember how my friends were passionately discussing it. One girl was complaining that she did not understand anything; the movie was confusing for her, dark, disturbing, the children characters - sad, pale, poorly dressed. I remember her asking, Why did they show a boy in the opening scene that had an awful stutter, and they never showed that boy again? What did it mean when the dying man in bed was setting a bird free? How did he get the bird on the first place? Another friend of mine, a guy, tried to explain the things to her. He suggested that she thought about the times Zerkalo was showing, he tried to explain to her Tarkovsky's symbolism where the bird could be representing life and soul of the main character and the boy with the stutter could mean that it was most difficult for people to communicate and understand each other. I only listened to their argument and did not participate because I had not seen the film yet. When it finally happened, Andrei Arsenievich Tarkovsky was presented at the screening and he talked to the audience before the show. I remember him repeating over and over that there were no tricks, no puzzles, and no tongue-in-cheeks in the film; that every symbol, image, dialog, and sound was there because they belonged there. He asked us if we had questions. Someone from the audience suggested that we saw the film first, and then, asked questions. Tarkovsky replied that from his experience, not many viewers would sit through the film and who ever would, usually leave in silence, not asking anything. And then he told us a story. After Zerkalo was completed, it was first shown to the group of the famous critics. After watching it, critics started to argue about it, trying to find the hidden meaning and make sense of what they just saw. It went on and on until the cleaning lady who came to the screening room and had been waiting for the end of discussion to do her job, asked them for how long they would stay? Someone said to her that they were discussing a very complicated film, and they needed time to understand it. Cleaning lady asked, What is that you do not understand in this film? I saw it also, and I understood everything. Critics were silenced for a moment, and then, one of them asked the woman to share her thoughts on Zerkalo. She answered, It is about a man who had caused too much pain to the ones whom he loved and who loved him. Now he is dying and he is trying to ask them for forgiveness but he does not know how. After the pause Tarkovsky said that he had nothing else to add about his film to what the cleaning lady had to say.I never understood complains that Zerkalo is a very confusing, difficult, and dark film. No, it is clear and deep as a mirror. Tarkovsky said so himself, and I believe him. Every time you look at the mirror, it will show you new depth and reflections. Past, presence, future, memory, love, guilt, forgiveness, beauty, sadness, nostalgia, and sacrifice - the mirror reflects it all -just watch closely. This is the film about his family, his country, and his times. Childhood memory and the memory of the past generations glued together. The film is a look back in time and sad realization that children reflect destiny of fathers, as in a mirror. Destinies reflected one in another. Zerkalo is not just good cinema, it is pure cinema.

Many of the IMDb reviewers of Logan's Run hit the nail on the head when they say that this film is definitely a product of its time. Yes, the special effects are sort of laughable now (the teeny tiny maze cars zipping through the a model of the city that looks about six inches tall), but you have to judge those sorts of things in the context of the time they were made. As strange as it may seem to people who now expect Lord of the Rings-quality special effects, Logan's Run was cutting edge in its day. And a few of the special effects still stand up fairly well. The light envelope that comes down over the Carousel or the matte shots of Washington. Not great for twenty-first century film-making, but a minor miracle for 1976.The story has more holes than a piece of swiss cheese and the acting is a bit touch and go, but that doesn't get in the way of a fairly entertaining movie. Seeing the movie all these years later I suppose the few moments of bad acting hit me more than anything else. As a kid I thought that Peter Ustinov's old man was brilliant, but now it just seems like awkward overacting. Which isn't to say that his character isn't somewhat endearing.Michael York, a really wonderful actor, misses the mark a few times, but generally he and Jenny Agutter do a fine job.Listen, this isn't a brilliant movie, but it does have its moments. Most science fiction movies made in the 1970s haven't endured the test of time especially well. With the purple mascara, pastel-coloured costumes and hair feathered like a great phoenix.

Everybody deserves to have a bad movie once in a while, All The Pretty Horses was this movie for Matt Damon. I am huge fan of Matt Damon, but I didn't understand why he chose to make a movie with a stilted script. With the talent of Damon, Billy Bob Thornton, Penelope Cruz and Henry Thomas; I expected All The Pretty Horses to be competent in the presentation of the film. I spent most of the movie wandering why it was made and the purpose of the journey Damon and Thomas were taking. All The Pretty Horses has no charm and nearly put me to sleep with the uninteresting story it had and characters it introduced. I have never been a Billy Bob Thornton fan as an actor or director. His directorial effort of All The Pretty Horses has not changed my opinion. I had to force myself to stay awake throughout the movie and keep watching to see if it would get better, but it didn't. I kept asking myself what the true point of this movie was since it was unclear. There is more chemistry between Damon and Thomas than there is between Damon and Cruz. It was a mistake to classify this film as a romance because there is none.It was a bad decision to cut the running length of the film by two hours because it took away from the explanation of the whole movie. All The Pretty Horses takes too long to get the point across. When it finally gets to the point it is too late and 10 minutes later the film is over.Neither the beautiful scenery nor all the pretty horses can save this film from disaster. All The Pretty Horses is just one entry I would put in my book of movies to stay away from under all circumstances. I nominate this film to go in the category of failures alongside Battlefield Earth and The Cell.All The Pretty Horses was a complete waste of my time, their talent and creativity. I know this was only going to be an isolated incident because the cast is too talented to be associated with failures.

I had seen The Eye, and felt that while it had some excellent set pieces and scary moments, that it could have been better. Perhaps the American remake will be good, unlike The Ring. I had also seen Bangkok Haunted, a horror movie which had atmosphere, but few scare. So I came to this, knowing that the directors were stylish, but that they needed a superior, straighter story to tell if I was to appreciate them fully. This has it all. Great story, which will hold you until the end, fully drawn captivating characters, explosive and original action, strong performances, superb editing and dialogue, and packed with emotion. As I may have said, I'm a sucker for sentimentality, and real love stories, not the ones Hollywood tries to sell us 95% of the time, and this has both. But don't be put off if you hate that sort of thing, there is a lot of violence too, and the lovers are both very attractive. So, the story, not totally original, few are these days, but too much emphasis is placed on originality, and this adds many clever twists to an old story. A deaf-mute hitman seeks revenge on those who wronged him, while protecting his girlfriend, and proving he is not simply a killer. The climax is just as good, if not better than anything in The Matrix, and this has as many stand out scenes. But enough praise. It will probably be difficult to get hold of this film, but see it if you get the chance. Truly beautiful. Will probably climb my list as time goes on.

There is Mimi, pregnant and just left alone by the father of her child. And there is Kit, very slim, very beautiful and very popular but set under pressure by her mother who is obsessed with beauty. All three have just finished school and are about to decide what they want to do with their future or, in Lucy's and Kit's case, what they parents want them to do with their future. Now Mimi gets the idea to drive to a song contest in L.A. and invites the other girls to come with her. So the three of them go on a road trip, every one for her own reasons and their driver is Ben, a musician, who wants to work in L.A. As you can imagine, at the end of their trip each of them has changed, learned a lesson and more or less reached her\/his dream.It is obvious that the movie is nothing more but a glorification of Britney Spears and her talents. She looks great; she sings great, the Lucy star is shining above all. Everything circles around her, everyone always tries to cheer her up, she always has luck, she gets the boy and of course at the end it's she who gets the record deal her dreams. Watching the movie you really ask yourself why the other characters exist at all. The movie now and then tries to deal with them but then suddenly drops them to get back to Lucy. This happens many times. We get to know that Kit was chubby as a child but was violently pushed by her mother to lose weight. We also get to know that Mimi's pregnancy is the result of a rape and her only dream is to become a singer. But the script doesn't care. As soon as the story begins to concentrate on Mimi or Kit, something happens to Lucy and her friends immediately forget about her problems and concentrate on her. Ben also is nothing more but a toy boy whose role it is to cheer up Lucy, to make her happy and in the times he is not dealing with Lucy his role is to shut up and to look good. Also it is incredible how great those teenagers deal with the problems the script tortures them with and smile again ten seconds later.Concerning the way the movie is made I guess it aimed at teenagers and of course, fans of Britney. Yet I wouldn't recommend the movie to teenagers for many reasons. I would even forbid it to them. The movie pretends to be a light summer fairy tale but underneath it, it makes some really dangerous things looking very attractive. It implies for example that it's more than OK for a seventeen year old girl to cruise through the U.S. with a stranger, stay at every shabby motel, not to be afraid to go into bars for adults, participate in a song contest and dance like a stripper there and to have sex with whom she wants. Just to name some. Of course a road trip is an exciting thing but not for teenagers as they lack responsibility and sensibility and can quickly find themselves in dangerous situations they cannot deal with (yet).Don't get me wrong &#150; I think Britney is not too bad at acting and maybe a good singer. But I just wish that she made her debut in a better movie than this crap. It's a bad script, a really stupid plot where you don't know where it's aiming at and besides a waste of time for the actors having participated in it.

The Last Temptation of Christ points that out too, but this Jesus isn't so much afraid of the pain as he is afraid of not ever living his life. That is where the last temptation takes place. In the last half hour or so of the movie, Jesus is guided by a guardian angel and shown what his life would be like if he hadn't have sacrificed himself. It turns out that life isn't all it's cracked up to be, and things end up terrible because he never died for peoples' sins. It's basically It's a Wonderful Life except instead of George Bailey never being born, it's Jesus Christ never being crucified.I really loved this movie, the way it was presented was amazing. It was so vivid and dreamlike; you feel very up close and personal with Jesus, especially since you can actually hear his thoughts. The acting is just great. Willem Dafoe fills Jesus' sandals quite nicely and provides a believable different angle of a Jesus who has fear, weakness, self-doubt, and seems to be making things up as he goes along. There are many complaints about Harvey Keitel's performance as Judas (most notably the thick New York accent) and many say it's the one thing that brings down the movie, but I thought he was great. He's definitely the most interesting apostle since he actually betrayed his leader- the movie suggests that Jesus was closest to him and he requested that Judas should betray him so he could fulfill his destiny on the cross. Hey, ya never know.This is typical Scorsese mastery. It's a thought-provoking, emotional film that will stick with you for a long time. Just try to remember it's only a movie and it's just offering a different point of view of Jesus Christ. And most likely a more accurate one, too.My rating 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 May 2004","score":"18 out of 29 people found the following review useful","review":" Usually when a movie about Jesus wants to point out that he was just a human being they stress the pain factor- he feels pain like anyone else and is afraid to die, especially in such a horrifically painful way.

There are many complaints about Harvey Keitel's performance as Judas (most notably the thick New York accent) and many say it's the one thing that brings down the movie, but I thought he was great. He's definitely the most interesting apostle since he actually betrayed his leader- the movie suggests that Jesus was closest to him and he requested that Judas should betray him so he could fulfill his destiny on the cross. Hey, ya never know.This is typical Scorsese mastery. It's a thought-provoking, emotional film that will stick with you for a long time.

The Last Temptation of Christ points that out too, but this Jesus isn't so much afraid of the pain as he is afraid of not ever living his life. That is where the last temptation takes place. In the last half hour or so of the movie, Jesus is guided by a guardian angel and shown what his life would be like if he hadn't have sacrificed himself. It turns out that life isn't all it's cracked up to be, and things end up terrible because he never died for peoples' sins. It's basically It's a Wonderful Life except instead of George Bailey never being born, it's Jesus Christ never being crucified.I really loved this movie, the way it was presented was amazing.

PSYCHO is such a classic and influential movie in so many ways.PSYCHO is the story of a woman named Marion (Janet Leigh) who goes to stay at a hotel run by a sweet, lighthearted, yet still somewhat creepy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who lives in a house nearby with his mother. Little does Marion know, somebody in that house is a deranged freak. She ends up being killed that same night she checks in, in the infamous shower scene that will ALWAYS be a classic moment in film history. The rest of the movie is basically the murder scene being investigated, and everything is brought up to one of the most chilling and shocking conclusions you can imagine.What else can I say about PSYCHO? Great in every aspect. Acting, scripting, casting, directing (of course)... everything is so natural and subtle. The way that Hitchcock prepares everything for the viewer ultimately leads to total surprise when you least expect it.There's really not much else I can say about this movie, not much more praise I can give.

Sam's partner does the job and gets killed, by who, is unknown. While investigating the murder he finds himself getting involved with dangerous men, seeking the myth of a Maltese Falcon statue, so valueable, they're willing to do anything it takes to get it.This movie is most of the way a real original film-noir, where our head character and supposed good guy finds himself getting involved in something larger and more dangerous than he should be able to handle. Although whether Humprey Bogart is playing that good a guy in his character, Sam Spade, can be discussed, Sam Spade is portrayed as a sort of egocentric partly greedy man, who is obviously supposed to be our hero, but on his journey we see greedy and often cynic and egocentric sides of him. The strength of this movie is the constant curiousity we have for how the story will unfold, there is always a mysterious look for the story, and it feels interesting because it is this detective story where we are participating in slowly unfolding the mystery. However, the movie has quite a few plot holes, and the many fast paced match cuts doesn't give us much time to think deeper into what's happening, everything is really going too fast, something that also means the atmosphere in the movie feels pretty non existant and my interest were never gathered 100%. The acting in the movie is actually quite great, especially for this old a movie. In older movies I often think that the acting seems to many of the actors to be awkvard, but not in this movie, in this movie it's quite convincing, despite a few flaws, flaws though that is a part of giving this movie the charming oldies feel.To sum it all up a bit. The movie, despite having quite a number of flaws, is overall an interesting experience, that will leave you guessing and hold your interest for most of the time, even though it has its drop downs, it's still a pretty well done mystery story, following the classic film-noir model much of the way.

The feature has Bruce Wayne's alter ego being framed for grisly murders by another vigilante... this one called the Phantasm.  The Phantasm has targeted mob bosses around Gotham, and the mob has begun searching for the killer, including Batman's nemesis, the Joker, voiced brilliantly as usual by Mark Hamill.  Tying in with matters is Bruce encountering his lost love, Andrea, which causes him to reflect back on his events of his past with her, including his transformation into the guise of Batman.  This is a very good animated feature, featuring strong animation, a great soundtrack, and an excellent voice cast.  However, two of the reasons I enjoyed this film were things that the animated movie were able to get away with, things that Batman The Animated Series, or Fox to be specific, wouldn't allow1.  Characters die.  There was never any death in TAS.  Although this is also a good thing in ways, when one is discussing Batman, of all things, death is usually a common issue.  No death can be good to hide from the really little kids, but can also cause a series to become extremely unrealistic and laughable(Cough, G I Joe, cough).  Here, though, many of the mob bosses are killed by the Phantasm quite gruesomely, and the animated Joker is seen using his infamous, and quite lethal, Joker Venom effectively for the very first time.  The fights are also quite violent, unlike in the animated show, we actually get to see Batman bleed, something that surprised when I first saw the film back during its theatrical release.2.  Batman doesn't always win.  I'm sorry, but when I realized Batman The Animated Series ALWAYS had Batman come out on top and save Gotham from whatever crime boss or sadistic villain he faced, I grew out of it and stopped watching.  Here, however, he is humbled greatly.  I actually compared this to an early episode of the TV series, On Leather Wings, in which he is also framed and being chased by the police.  On the episode he avoided the cops and was able to get away from them quite easily.  Here, though, he had great difficulty trying to get away and almost wound up in police custody, even at one point being horribly wounded AND losing his mask.So this is at last the good animated version of Batman fans were looking for.  I suggest fans see this.  Don't worry, it's accessible, even if you've never seen an episode of Batman The Animated Series before in your life.

He keeps on going, as people want to use his mathematical abilities for their own selfish reasons. Max struggles with his various mental and physiological problems as he's working with this-so much that if you watch it once you can't distinguish between reality and Max's mind.Aronofsky makes this movie on parking meter money (less than $10,000), yet it's one of the most stylish movies of recent memory. Shot in black\/white (there is barely any grey) with a type of vision that leaves edges to the imagination, Pi works in its own little world. With a short runtime that's shorter than Dennis Miller on one of his longwinded analogies, it works.

With a short runtime that's shorter than Dennis Miller on one of his longwinded analogies, it works. The theories that the movie puts in your head are complete bull-honky, but they're presented in a way that you can't help believing (like many people think about Michael Moore).Well acted all around, especially by Guellette, Pi is not for everyone. There's many disturbing moments, involving brains and power tools. The second-to-last scene, just so you know, was actually done, no special effects. Overall, Pi is a very good, trippy movie that's not for everyone. But if you're game, go for it.My rating 8\/10Rated R for language and some disturbing images.

She thinks AIDS is contagious like the Common Cold so doesn't want her son going anywhere near Dexter.After many attempts at making their own cure with no success, the boys go on their way to New Orleans to find the cure after reading a pamphlet about it.  After getting their kicks from Playboy magazine, Dexter's health goes south shortly afterwards and as his health detoriates, there's still enough life in the boy alongside Erik for two pranks of pretending to stop breathing.

(Sample insight they agree that masturbation feels good.) A woman joins them, adding nothing to the mix. After two hours it ends. There is no story, no characterization, no relationships, not even a hint of writing or directing talent.It's not the actors' fault. They dutifully disrobe, simulate intercourse, and they look okay naked. But there is less meaning here than there is in the average porn vid.I guess some of these rave reviews are from kids who are excited to see nudity and hear dirty talk. I direct these children to their older brothers' socks drawer, where they'll find more intelligent handling of sexual and gender issues in any 4-Hour XXX video.Though the cast is attractive, even the sex scenes boring. There is not an interesting or original thought, shot, or line of dialogue in the whole film.The idea that this movie has anything to say about politics or sex roles or coming of age is ludicrous. The morons who compare this movie to masterpieces by Truffaut, Fellini, or Almodovar should be shot for sacrilege. It takes more than two actors and an actress on screen to make JULES ET JIM.To repeat ALL THAT HAPPENS in this movie is two boys and one woman ride in a car, get naked, sit around on the beach, have sex, and read page after page of pointless, clichéd dialogue. These aren't characters, they're voids with names.The filmmakers haven't the talent to even begin to suggest characterization or plot development. The political side, which some posters find so intriguing, amounts to the narrator telling us, near the end, that the PRI lost an election -- which has no connection to anything said or done by the characters. Faux meaning doesn't get any more faux than this.It would have been easy to append a phony political point to the film, maybe by having the leads murdered by the oppressed masses -- giving the film at least an illusion of meaning -- but the filmmakers aren't smart enough to figure this out.I've seen many films I've disliked, even hated, but there was always SOME talent involved in their making.

'Austin Powers in Goldmember' follows in the footsteps of the previous two incarnations and yet it still is appealing to the public. But I don't know whether the makers of the film are still mocking James Bond movies, or if they just saw that the series is a success and are trying to squeeze as much as they can out of it.-Humour There are some great jokes in this movie. Many of them are just updates from the previous films, but there are some new ones, too, and the new ones are the best, in my opinion. The lines are still racy, of course. Look for the line I chose as the title of this review. 21\/25-Physical Comedy Not too many moments of physical comedy can be seen, given that the Austin Powers movies have always been about funny expressions with double meaning, which is why they are surely not as popular among people who don't speak English. Mike Myers and Verne Troyer, who plays Mini-Me, provide basically all of the physical comedy. They still couldn't find a funny female character, even though Beyonce Knowles is a bit better than the totally unfunny Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Graham. 7\/20-Plot By the way they advertised the movie, the plot was supposed to be that Austin goes back in time to save his father. But that really is a small part of the whole film, the rest being a sequence of events quite hard to follow logically. 4\/15-Ending I liked the ending a lot. Of course, taste varies. 9\/10-Theme A spy who has everything tries to get a little more and to save the world, while he's at it.

There have been some signficant changes. Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) features very little in the movie and Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) doesn't feature at all. The storyline formula is virtually the same is the first two, but the film contains far too much of the sort of slapstick comedy that underscored, and nearly undermined, the previous efforts.The film opens with a ridiculous slapstick credits sequence that finishes with Superman (Christopher Reeve) rescuing a man who nearly drowns in his own car. Elsewhere, unemployed no-hoper Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) signs up to train as a computer programmer and finds himself to be something of a genius at it. Before too long, he comes to the attentions of magnate Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn) who intends to use Gorman's talents to help him amass a fortune from coffee and oil. Unfortunately, Superman scuppers their plans, prompting Webster and Gorman to try and put him out of action...The usual superheroics ensure. Superman comes to the aid of a burning chemical plant, an imperilled coffee crop, before a final showdown with a deadly Supercomputer. Away from all the flying around, in his secret identity of Clark Kent, Superman reacquaints himself with an old high school flame Lana Lang (an appealing Annette O'Toole), and her young son Ricky (Paul Kaethler).In an interesting twist, the villains acquire some Kryptonite, the only substance to which Superman is vulnerable. Exposed to it, our hero turns into a drunken lout before splitting himself into two personas, one good and one evil, who duel it out for dominance in a fantastic, scrapyard-bound fistfight.Superman III works best when it's being played straight, especially in the gentler moments between Clark and Lana Lang. However too much of the film depends on unfunny, overplayed comedy. The main culprit in this is Richard Pryor, as far too many scenes function as setups for his strained and over-the-top standup routines.Robert Vaughn gives a good performance as Webster, but (like Lex Luthor before him) is neither sufficiently threatening or imposing as the main villain. Annie Ross and Pamela Stephenson, as his sister and mistress respectively, are ineffectual and unappealing sidekicks.Keeping his head through all of this is Christopher Reeve as the eponymous superhero. He really enjoys going bad in this film, and otherwise maintains a consistent and credible performance.An enjoyable flick, but for the excessive comedy. The series would eventually be killed off with the anodyne Superman IV The Quest For Peace.

Superman comes to the aid of a burning chemical plant, an imperilled coffee crop, before a final showdown with a deadly Supercomputer. Away from all the flying around, in his secret identity of Clark Kent, Superman reacquaints himself with an old high school flame Lana Lang (an appealing Annette O'Toole), and her young son Ricky (Paul Kaethler).In an interesting twist, the villains acquire some Kryptonite, the only substance to which Superman is vulnerable. Exposed to it, our hero turns into a drunken lout before splitting himself into two personas, one good and one evil, who duel it out for dominance in a fantastic, scrapyard-bound fistfight.Superman III works best when it's being played straight, especially in the gentler moments between Clark and Lana Lang. However too much of the film depends on unfunny, overplayed comedy. The main culprit in this is Richard Pryor, as far too many scenes function as setups for his strained and over-the-top standup routines.Robert Vaughn gives a good performance as Webster, but (like Lex Luthor before him) is neither sufficiently threatening or imposing as the main villain. Annie Ross and Pamela Stephenson, as his sister and mistress respectively, are ineffectual and unappealing sidekicks.Keeping his head through all of this is Christopher Reeve as the eponymous superhero. He really enjoys going bad in this film, and otherwise maintains a consistent and credible performance.An enjoyable flick, but for the excessive comedy. The series would eventually be killed off with the anodyne Superman IV The Quest For Peace.  ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi"}]
