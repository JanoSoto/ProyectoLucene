However, I disagree with some  that the shaky cam during the Normandy sequence was jarring or headache -inducing. Completely drawn in, never once did I stop to think I was viewing  the gore and horror through a lens. I was there. And I didn't want to be. I  closed my eyes during some scenes, but I couldn't close my ears, I couldn't  escape - the bullets kept on flying.How could anyone survive something like that and go on to lead a semi-normal  life? I couldn't even watch White Christmas after seeing this movie; at  the first sight of a WWII jeep, I wanted to cry. What is it like for  someone who was really there?Good movies simultaneously make us think and feel, and this one did that for  me. I only wish Spielberg would have cast unknowns in all of the parts;  seeing Tom Hanks and Matt Damon in the midst of this ultra-realistic  violence reminded me it was still Hollywood pulling the strings. Most  people have commented that Hanks should win an Oscar, but I think that  would be unfair to the rest of the cast. The grueling process they had to  endure, the dark heart of humanity each actor had to face to make such a  film, makes them all deserving of recognition. Hanks played Captain Miller  with honesty and grace, but I don't think he necessarily outshone the  performances of Tom Sizemore, Ed Burns, or Jeremy Davies.Analyzing the plot or the characters is missing the point. If the Jew had  been the sniper from Tennesee or the Brooklynite had been the combat-shy  translator, most of you would still complain about stereotypes. People say  they didn't care about the characters because they weren't interesting.  Is everyone you meet on the street incredibly interesting? I doubt it.

Well, that's great for you, but if everyone knows war is bad,  death is bad, why is it still so rampant in our society? War is always  happening somewhere. This movie shows that not only is war hell, but the  death of one man is just as tragic. If everyone really did know this, we  wouldn't have gang wars, drive-by shootings, or terrorist bombings.  Everyone NEEDS to know this. And if a gut-wrenching movie will drive this  message home to those people, then I'm all for it.And though this is getting too long already, I have to say one more thing  many of you didn't care for the apparent sappiness of the bookend scenes  of the old man at the cemetery.
