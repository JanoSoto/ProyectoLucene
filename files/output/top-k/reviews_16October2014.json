Put it off as well, because obviously being a bloke, it was never 'cool' to like SuperGirl when you're a kid.And do you know what? Its actually a lot better than I remembered it to be.I'm not going into the story, I'd rather just state what I do and don't like about the movie.Firstly, Helen Slater. Decidedly toned down as a schoolgirl as shes supposed to be, but when she turns into SuperGirl.... Damn she still looks great.Without wanting to sound like a fashion designer, her costume has aged really well. Skirt isn't too short but short enough, her hair isn't worn in a style other than long and down and to be honest, if you could transport the Helen Slater SuperGirl complete look into a modern movie, she really wouldn't look out of place, shes the one part that didn't look dated.Jerry Goldsmiths theme.... I remembered it well, but there's nothing like hearing it properly again for the first time in decades. Obviously its not as iconic as Supermans theme, but its still a damn fine composition.Put it this way, whilst I enjoyed Man of Steel.... I really couldn't begin to remember what the theme was.Even the titles at the start seem very modern, even the use of the font still looks modern.For the most part, the VFX are as good as Superman 1 & 2, I would say that the flying sequences in SuperGirl were better, probably because Helen Slater moves easier in the flying harness in comparison to the much larger Christopher Reeve, and there appeared to make a real effort to get her to mimic the flying conditions of whatever is projected behind her so that for the most part her movement matches the film, whereas in Superman it wasn't always the case.There's one scene where shes flying above some horses, and there's a massive flare from the sun appears on film, so they matched the flare onto her as well to just try and make it more believable shes there.However, it was a lot easier to spot the wires holding her up than in Superman, i'm not entirely sure why, not sure if its crappier film quality thats shown it up, or simply that the film makers hoped the shots would be fast enough that you simply don't see them, but we do, and quite often which is a shame, because a couple of her flying sequences are done really well.Faye Dunaway was alright, her comedic friend was OK, Peter Cooke I really didn't like in the role, constantly scowling and sneering. OK, I get it that its supposed to be his character, he just seemed out of place in this movie.The one thing the movie suffered from was exposition..... not enough of it. Sure, today we bitch and moan about movies that have too much with characters having convenient conversations so we can get some important plot details, but the movie was clever enough to have a radio announcement that Superman was travelling millions of light years away to investigate something so that gave useful account of why he wasn't around (hey, why couldn't Iron Man 3 be that clever?), but then there was the whole Argo City conundrum.Kara (SuperGirl) is related to Clark Kent, yet Krypton was destroyed. Was Argo City a part of Krypton or was it a separate entity of its own? Did Zaltar save them? Why let him go so readily to the Phantom Zone if he was their saviour? A couple of other issues. Its clear that Kara likes the male love interest in the movie, and yes she has to save Argo City first, but there's no acknowledgement that shes going to come back, just that she has to go, and that everyone keep quiet about it, and when you consider Jimmy Olsen from the Superman movies is there as well, its inconceivable to believe he'd keep quiet about meeting a member of his family.Kara was almost like a young teenager on Argo City, but all of a sudden becomes worldly wise (a world shes not from incidentally) virtually right away when she lands on Earth.I'll state right now, SuperGirl *IS* a better movie than either Superman III or IV. Other than the conflict between Superman and Clark Kent in III, there wasn't much to redeem that movie, and the less said about IV the better.I understand that for the most part, Americans got short changed on SuperGirl MASSIVELY, they had over 20minutes chopped out of the movie for seemingly no good reason, which affects lots of scenes, and makes certain things kind of what?, probably why this movie is more regarded this side of the pond.The storyline for the most part was so, so, I didn't really care too much for the sorcery and witch angle, though I'm lead to believe both are staple adversaries for Superman in the comics.A real shame then that we'll never see Helen Slater don the cape again, she was stunning in the role and captured the innocence of the character, and for the most part you can thank Superman III's performance at the Box Office for this one failing, it seemed people had started to tire of anything to do with Superman and anything associated with the character.By all accounts SuperGirl wasn't a flop, it just didn't perform anywhere near expectations.A shame, I really didn't mind this one at all.

Strange too because it assembles an armada of talented actors and craftsmen in the service of what turns out to be a Z-grade slasher movie. Why would you want to cast two actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, hire Jerry Goldsmith to conduct a wonderful score and give the movie some incredible special effects and then put them in the service of a story that doesn't try anything new? Kevin Bacon stars as Sebastian Caine, a scientist on the verge of discovering how to make living beings invisible. An opening shot is quite astonishing, showing the visibility serum coursing through the veins of an invisible gorilla. It's veins filling up like twigs and moving to the vital organs until it looks like one of those 'Visible Gorilla' models you see in science class. Bacon grows tired of experimenting on lab animals and is ready to move on to phase three which is, you guessed it, a human experiment.Meanwhile, Bacon's ex-girlfriend (Elisabeth Shue) has been seeing someone new. We know who it is (he works in the lab) and we also know that Bacon will find out via invisibility but by the time we get there the movie is pretty much dead in the water. Why reveal her lover's identity? Why not at least leave something for the audience to think about? Just as fascinating as the gorilla we get to see Bacon go through the same test until his living skeleton disappears. What does the movie do then? Not much. Director Paul Verhoven stops all creativity and decides to have the newly invisible man grope females in their sleep then stalk the other scientists and try to kill them. The movie does have some fun in the climactic scenes as the supporting cast keeps coming up with new ways to make Bacon visible.Speaking of the supporting cast, they aren't much just the usual stock characters who run around behind the more known actors and are required to be killed in the ascending order that the fall in the closing credits. Even Bacon's final scene seems lifted out of a thousand of other movies climbing to catch Shue and her lover in an elevator shaft as fire rises under their feet.'Hollow Man' was directed by Paul Verhoven whose films I have not come to like very much. His only good film was 'RoboCop' because of its sardonic sense of humor and it's bleak vision of the future. His films such as 'Showgirls', 'Starship Troopers' and 'Basic Instinct' are always glossy and slick but never smart or intelligent. It reminded me in a way of 'The Fly' that great 1986 horror flick in which Jeff Goldblume was meshed with a common housefly and had a girlfriend trying to help him as his body degenerated. That movie worked because we cared about his character and we knew that there was chemistry between the two leads. 'Hollow Man' has the set up but no means for a payoff.

If we're not counting Halloween 3, which at least on some level works if you consider it a standalone movie, Halloween 5 was the worst of the series at the time, and the furthest we have been from the original. Michael Myers has gone from the clean simple kills of the first movie, to slicing people up with scythes and stabbing teenagers with pitchforks.Like with Halloween 2, this movie picks up right where it's prequel ended, with Myers falling down a well, that they subsequently blow up. Of course, he survives. Jamie is put in a children's hospital, and finds a friend in Billy, a boy her same age. Rachel is still around, as is Loomis and one of the cops from Halloween IV, but everyone else is gone. There's a new pair of friends to be slaughtered, some of which you're supposed to want dead. Loomis has finally gone completely insane, and I really did enjoy Pleasance's portrayal of the character, from beginning to end... if only this was the end.With regards to the cinematics of the movie, the long straight cuts are for the most part gone, though there are still some of those slow-moving shots where you'll see Myers' shadow or mask in the background, though I can't say I got the chills from any of them. The effects range from OK to down-right dumb, some of those gunshots look more like someone using a tinderbox than anything else, and I had some serious issues with how poorly some scenes were dubbed. The substantial cut in budget is very obvious. Why they decided to spend some of it on making a new mask for Don Shanks to wear.The plot is confusing, and has one of the weirdest endings you couldn't imagine. It's an obvious setup for a sequel that was put on ice for years because of the horrible reception this movie got. Jamie's somehow got some sort of a mental bond with Myers, and she's gone mute. Every time Myers kills, or is about to kill, she has a seizure of sorts where she sees what is happening. Loomis, who's completely obsessed by Myers at this point, is constantly pestering and pushing her for information, which she (at first) is unable or unwilling to share. I have no clue why they decided to have Rachel be the first kill, while trying to make us care about a couple of teenagers that we just met, before Myers gets around to killing them.You don't really care about any characters besides Jamie and Loomis. I mean, you might hate some of the new characters, like the kid who puts on a copy of Michael's mask, you know, like they already did in a Halloween movie. I'd like to believe that no kid would ever be stupid enough to do that, knowing Myers' history and that the police would be on edge about it. I'd like to believe. Anyway, Michael seems to be targeting Jamie, and anyone she loves, and it honestly seems like he's really thinking it through, killing Tina's boyfriend to get close to Tina, and later going after the Children's Hospital to get the cops away from the Myers House, where he knows Loomis and Jamie are waiting for him. It all seems very well planned, compared to the much more random killings he's done in the past.The most mind-numbing twist comes at the end. Throughout the movie you get shots of a man dressed in all black, coat included, and some iron-tipped cowboy boots. At the end, after Myers' capture, the same man shoots up a police station and breaks him out. Out of absolutely nowhere.

Of course, he survives. Jamie is put in a children's hospital, and finds a friend in Billy, a boy her same age. Rachel is still around, as is Loomis and one of the cops from Halloween IV, but everyone else is gone. There's a new pair of friends to be slaughtered, some of which you're supposed to want dead. Loomis has finally gone completely insane, and I really did enjoy Pleasance's portrayal of the character, from beginning to end... if only this was the end.With regards to the cinematics of the movie, the long straight cuts are for the most part gone, though there are still some of those slow-moving shots where you'll see Myers' shadow or mask in the background, though I can't say I got the chills from any of them. The effects range from OK to down-right dumb, some of those gunshots look more like someone using a tinderbox than anything else, and I had some serious issues with how poorly some scenes were dubbed. The substantial cut in budget is very obvious. Why they decided to spend some of it on making a new mask for Don Shanks to wear.The plot is confusing, and has one of the weirdest endings you couldn't imagine. It's an obvious setup for a sequel that was put on ice for years because of the horrible reception this movie got. Jamie's somehow got some sort of a mental bond with Myers, and she's gone mute. Every time Myers kills, or is about to kill, she has a seizure of sorts where she sees what is happening. Loomis, who's completely obsessed by Myers at this point, is constantly pestering and pushing her for information, which she (at first) is unable or unwilling to share. I have no clue why they decided to have Rachel be the first kill, while trying to make us care about a couple of teenagers that we just met, before Myers gets around to killing them.You don't really care about any characters besides Jamie and Loomis. I mean, you might hate some of the new characters, like the kid who puts on a copy of Michael's mask, you know, like they already did in a Halloween movie. I'd like to believe that no kid would ever be stupid enough to do that, knowing Myers' history and that the police would be on edge about it. I'd like to believe. Anyway, Michael seems to be targeting Jamie, and anyone she loves, and it honestly seems like he's really thinking it through, killing Tina's boyfriend to get close to Tina, and later going after the Children's Hospital to get the cops away from the Myers House, where he knows Loomis and Jamie are waiting for him. It all seems very well planned, compared to the much more random killings he's done in the past.The most mind-numbing twist comes at the end. Throughout the movie you get shots of a man dressed in all black, coat included, and some iron-tipped cowboy boots. At the end, after Myers' capture, the same man shoots up a police station and breaks him out. Out of absolutely nowhere. For no reason.The good thing about Halloween 3 was that you could judge it as an independent horror movie. You can't do that with this one. It's a Halloween movie. A terrible Halloween movie that really should have been the end to the series.

The series of course, is well known for its own sense of how an everyday item or circumstance can kill you at anytime in a freak accident and most of all, it made lots'o money. With such a really creative concept, does this movie work? Well&#x85; here's the story.Alex Browning, played by Devon Sawa, is about to board a plane along with his classmates on a field trip to Paris. Alex then has a vision that the plane is going to explode. He panics and gets off the plane, along with several other people. And as the plane departs, it really does explode. Everyone's traumatized and tries to move on from it, but it appears that they were all meant to die on the plane, so Death itself comes after the survivors one by one.While it's a first that a slasher like Freddy or Jason is chasing dumb teenagers, I will say it's an interesting concept. The teens, however, fall for the same things as they would in slasher flicks. The two main leads are the only ones who are aware of it while the others are either jerks or just don't care about it. But the fact that a supernatural force after them is interesting enough. Plus, I do like the creepy imagery they use which is to be used to be clues to how they'll die.So, does the movie entirely work? Ehhhnnnnot really. The biggest problem with the movie is that some of the deaths are too comedic. The more drawn out they are, the less believable it is. The most simplistic one is a bus hitting someone, but even then, that was a little too silly. What makes it funny is that it comes right the hell out of nowhere and just smashes into her like a slapstick Tom & Jerry joke. See, if there was buildup to that, like say she tried to get out of the way or someone yelled at her to get away, but ultimately gets hit, it would've worked better. Not a whole lot better, just less unintentionally funny. Even the first death is too much of a stretch. Water leaks in the bathroom, causing someone to trip and have the clothes wire to be wrapped around his neck and it tightens and tightens until he dies of asphyxiation. See, that's just too hard to believe, but say if the water caused him to trip and hit his head on the bathtub, that'd be more believable; you don't need to have anything to be wrapped around his neck. Also, I'm not an expert at trains at anything but they do have BRAKE SYSTEMS, DON'T THEY?!?So, yeah. The deaths are mediocre for the most part. How are the characters? As I mentioned before, they're your two-bit slasher teens. They're not that interesting because we've seen them before many times. The jock jerk that refuses to listen, the comic relief who cracks jokes just to create his own identity, the adults won't catch on. The main character is pretty likable though. I do like how desperate he is in trying to figure out the whole thing before it's too late. I think the only interesting character was the mortician, played by Tony Todd. He's just so mysterious and dark; you can pretty much imply that he is either Death or an associate of Death.So with all this, I don't think it's a terrible flick. I just think it could've been done a lot better. Like I said, it's a very well done concept. It's just too silly at times. It's sort of like watching a montage of Mortal Kombat Fatalities, just with an actual story. So if you're a fan of that sort of thing, than I say give it a view and you'll love it.

","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"16 October 2014","score":"","review":" Right, this review is a review of the film. Not the book. Not how true the film is to the book. Just a review, of the film. I have read the book but it was a very long time ago and I have seen this movie so many times I have forgotten what was in the book and what wasn't. This movie, for me, is fantastic. Let me start by saying that this film, or any of the Harry Potter films, is not a children's film. Of course they appeal to children and are marketed as such but they are certainly appreciated & enjoyed by adults.The story is well known and probably doesn't need overviewing again but I will do so anyway! As a toddler, Harry Potter is left on the doorstep of his Aunties & Uncles by Dumbledore. The story then skips forward 9 years or so and Harry is being treated as a Slave almost, an outcast by his family. He sleeps in a cupboard under the stairs, is bullied by his cousin & waits on his Auntie & Uncle hand and foot. As Harry nears his 11th Birthday, post with Harrys name on it starts arriving day after day until one day it arrives in its thousands. Scared by this his Auntie & Uncle take them away to a secluded cabin for a 'holiday'. Here, Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid meets them & informs Harry that he is a wizard and is to enrol at Hogwarts School. The rest of the story pans out with Harry at School, growing up fast, making friends & even enemies.This film is pure magic. It transports to viewer to a land which is in every way possible, very believable. The sets, the acting & the effects are all first rate. The Acting in particular (on the most part) is absolutely spot on. Rupert Grint (Ron), Emma Watson (Hermione), Robbie Coltrane (Hargrid) & Maggie Smith (McGonagall) are all outstanding. The late Richard Harris (Dumbledore) & the late Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon) also put in fantastic performances as well. My favourite character has to be Severus Snape, played by Alan Rickman. His performance as that character is faultless. My only gripe, is Harry Potter himself, played by Daniel Radcliffe. As far as acting is concerned, he is leagues behind the majority of other main actors. His acting may appear worse than it is as he is alongside some of the greatest British actors at this present time. Finding the lead actor poor should really bring the film down but with its fantastic array of other actors make up for it somewhat.Harry Potter & The Philosophers Stone is a fantastic film that appeals to all ages.

Not the book. Not how true the film is to the book. Just a review, of the film. I have read the book but it was a very long time ago and I have seen this movie so many times I have forgotten what was in the book and what wasn't. This movie, for me, is fantastic. Let me start by saying that this film, or any of the Harry Potter films, is not a children's film. Of course they appeal to children and are marketed as such but they are certainly appreciated & enjoyed by adults.The story is well known and probably doesn't need overviewing again but I will do so anyway! As a toddler, Harry Potter is left on the doorstep of his Aunties & Uncles by Dumbledore. The story then skips forward 9 years or so and Harry is being treated as a Slave almost, an outcast by his family. He sleeps in a cupboard under the stairs, is bullied by his cousin & waits on his Auntie & Uncle hand and foot. As Harry nears his 11th Birthday, post with Harrys name on it starts arriving day after day until one day it arrives in its thousands. Scared by this his Auntie & Uncle take them away to a secluded cabin for a 'holiday'. Here, Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid meets them & informs Harry that he is a wizard and is to enrol at Hogwarts School. The rest of the story pans out with Harry at School, growing up fast, making friends & even enemies.This film is pure magic. It transports to viewer to a land which is in every way possible, very believable. The sets, the acting & the effects are all first rate. The Acting in particular (on the most part) is absolutely spot on. Rupert Grint (Ron), Emma Watson (Hermione), Robbie Coltrane (Hargrid) & Maggie Smith (McGonagall) are all outstanding. The late Richard Harris (Dumbledore) & the late Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon) also put in fantastic performances as well. My favourite character has to be Severus Snape, played by Alan Rickman. His performance as that character is faultless. My only gripe, is Harry Potter himself, played by Daniel Radcliffe. As far as acting is concerned, he is leagues behind the majority of other main actors. His acting may appear worse than it is as he is alongside some of the greatest British actors at this present time. Finding the lead actor poor should really bring the film down but with its fantastic array of other actors make up for it somewhat.Harry Potter & The Philosophers Stone is a fantastic film that appeals to all ages.

Dwight Frye is also wonderful as Renfield, bringing chilling creepiness to every scene he inhabits. He also carries a sympathetic weight and tragedy throughout adding layers to the role.

Edward Van Sloan is the only other performance of note, filled with the authoritative dignity the man was renown for.

It can be appreciated for its story, lived intensely through its action scenes, emotionally experienced through the deeply established main characters, or soaked in. It is not a movie that leaves you smiling, but the action scenes can make it kind of fun if you don't care for any kind of stories. The story is very solid with good characters, but you don't need to follow the story to enjoy the fight scenes. The inverse can also be said in that the story can still be enjoyed by those who don't like the action. All three of the main elements of the movie, the execution, action, and story, are spiced up with diversity. The story has politics, emotional conflicts, character personalities, and practical issues introduced to it. This is exemplified by the political issues that arise from Commodus taking the place of his father instead of Maximus Lucilla being torn between her husband\/brother, Maximus, and her son Maximus keeping his dignity when becoming a slave; and his simple wish to return to his family and farm. The action visits multiple regions with epic battles, guerrilla style raids, one on one combat, and of course gladiator fighting. It is intense, but the shots are fairly quick so the gore does not have an overly painful effect on the audience (think high-speed sword fights over extended torture scenes). The execution has classic feels to it, but is rather ahead of its time for the most part. The cinematography is very good when it displays the battles, Maximus' fantasies of home, and the snake-like workings of Commodus. Plus, the visual quality and lighting is sharp throughout. The delivery of speech has a dramatic tone to it, but is also realistic at most points. The film score is kind of caught in the transition period from Hans Zimmer's current style and the John Williams style that it has in Crimson Tide. As to the characters, the main roles are well played and well developed. Maximus is not what you would call a round character. His main quality is that he is able to gain people's respect in his various roles. Whether he is leading a trained army or the scum of the kingdom, he is able to get people to obey, respect, and treat him with an almost child-like love, looking up to him as a role model. Russel Crowe's acting is good enough to not be criticized, but not good enough to be remarkable (though his delivery of the My name is Gladiator . . . and I will have my vengeance . . . quote is very striking). Commodus makes an excellent villain because at heart he is just a whiny little kid that has to have his way. His am I not merciful rant is a great summary of his personality. By the time he reaches his demise, he has acted so villainously that it is an indisputable fact that he had it coming to him. Joaquin Phoenix embodies his character quite convincingly, especially in the scene where he is forced to spare Maximus' life despite his own desires. Lucilla plays a strong female character who advocates justice despite its consequences. She kind of gets caught in the middle of everything that happens without a political escape route, but manages to sort of come out on top at the end. The other supporting roles like Juba and Marcus Aurelius add to the story without adding to the confusion of who is who and why did he or she do that. I think Juba's last line of Now we are free, is a great way to end the movie, because it kind of gives a tangible positive outcome of Maximus' death. The song by Lisa Gerrard that goes with the quote is an excellent piece of music to close out the movie. On a slight side note, I feel that the death of the main character at the end is sort of a sign that a movie is striving to become a classic. The same scenario comes up in Dead Poet's Society, and neither death is implausible or poorly portrayed, but it kind of forces you to take the movie up to that point more seriously. I'm not saying it is bad to include that element, but there are other ways to make a movie a classic and this movie will be one and would be even if Maximus' death had not been included. If you are considering whether Gladiator is worth a watch, I would say that is should satisfy as long as you're a fan of general action. There is more to the movie than the fight scenes, but there are enough of them that anyone who doesn't like action won't enjoy it. As for humorous elements, you'll get more laughs out of a blank sheet of paper (though if you've seen Nacho Libre, there are several moments where you can't resist pulling out a few quotes from the Jack Black wrestling comedy). As stated before the execution and story should satisfy most and is subject to very little criticism. So if you like action and a high-quality watch, set aside an evening or two for this movie.

The movie is one of the only character studies I have ever seen that Spielberg has made,in fact is is the study of a young black woman named Celie Johnson (played by Whoopi Goldberg in a groundbreaking film debut.) who gets tortured, abused, and loved at the same time by friends as well as family relatives. the abusive husband in this movie is played by Danny Glover who wants to marry Celie's sister but ends up marrying Celie instead, the saddest scene in this movie is when Celie's sister gets taken away from her because of the Glover character molesting her and throwing rocks at her for no apparent reason, while watching most of the movie people hate Glover's character but by the end of the film I learned that he wasn't much of a bad person after all. The movie also has a great supporting cast which consists of Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, Margaret Avery who is one of Celie's best friends and many more unknowns. This movie goes along with some of Spielberg's best films such as Schindler's List (1993), E.T.

The movie also has a great supporting cast which consists of Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, Margaret Avery who is one of Celie's best friends and many more unknowns.

But when the boy turns five, strange inexplicable events starts taking place & after the ominous warnings of a priest, Robert decides to uncover the true identity of his adopted child.Brilliantly directed by Richard Donner & deftly scripted by David Seltzer, the one thing I really like about this film is that it is very much aware of its strength & weaknesses and does a fascinating job in working on the former. Despite being a supernatural horror, it never explicitly depicts what's typical in those category of films which provides it a certain layer of realism & further amplifies the eerie mood it manages to sustain throughout its runtime.Also, it's not afraid to take its time for setting up the events, its characters & its ambiance and still manages to provide a smooth flow to everything. The camera-work is nicely carried out, editing is cleverly done & Jerry Goldsmith's score masterfully infuses a sense of uneasiness into the plot. Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner & others chip in with excellent performances and the final shot is one creepy image audience won't be forgetting soon.On an overall scale, The Omen may not have set any new standard in horror filmmaking although it does feature one of mainstream cinema's first on-screen decapitations but it still remains a spooky but entertaining cinematic ride that uses its resources pretty well. The unnecessary sequels & one remake it spawned might have dented its legacy a little but if you're looking for a finely crafted chiller that's neither too extreme nor too heavy, then look no further than The Omen.

And the bone-shattering scene dawning of man is for me the most iconic scene I have ever seen in film. The transition from bone to space-station is nearly as iconic. Both visualise human evolution, from vegetarian ape to tool-using meat-hunting human, from stone-age to space-faring modernity. It symbolises the rising abilities of mankind. And the final scenes even reach further than the current state of man-kind.Moreover, in this film the selection of music for each scene is just perfect for me. I love the chorus music for the black stone. The choice of the opening fanfare of Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Strauss is goosebumps-rising perfect for me. Or the waltz The Blue Danube for the rotating space station and the space voyage.Yes, there are some parts which need patience, but those just symbolise the slow life of earlier times and the vast land our few ancestors roamed. I'm reminded of Koyaanisqatsi (1982) there. ","genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi"}]
