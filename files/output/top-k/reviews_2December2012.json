Of course, a fourth outing of the British agent James Bond would not be as good as the three first. And it wasn't. Goldfinger marked the point where Bond movies would try to top the previous in any way possible! Not only would it hurt the movie, but it would't be very positively viewed by the fans. Thunderball was the first Bond movie trying to top the previous. And it just didn't work. Thunderball isn't a bad Bond film... it's just not that good! It doesn't has the same stylish feel as the others, and it isn't anyway near as entertaining or intense! It's also kind of forgettable! It went to become the second (and possibly last) Bond film to win an Oscar. It won for best effects, best visual effects.Surprisingly, Terence Young directed Thunderball. While he directed Dr. No and From Russia With Love flawlessly, it's like he doesn't know what to do with this movie. Is he going to make another serious Bond film which resembles a spy thriller, or a silly but still entertaining Bond flick as Goldfinger was! SPECTRE has stolen two atomic nuclear warheads, and are threatening to blow a city in USA or England up, unless ransom money are paid. As always it's Bond's job to prevent it all, find the warheads and disarm them. Not a bad plot. But the movie is just so bland! It lacks the suspense and intensity that made the the other three so great. But the movie isn't that bad! It's got some memorable action, some very beautiful women, good humor, etc. I suppose that it's because it precedes such good films as the previous. Had it been a later entry in the series it might have seemed better! But the movie could have been told better, and it could have been much more entertaining instead of much more bland!Sean Connery is James Bond for the fourth time, and he's good as usual. But I do think that he sometimes looks bored, and this is the first film where he begins to show his age. But Connery is Connery and he is awesome! But I do think he could have been better and more sophisticated in this film! Claudine Auger is the Bond girl, Domino Derval! She's incredibly sexy, but she is kinda boring at times, and her acing isn't that good. But she's OK. She is relevant to the story, and you can't say that about many Bond girls! Adolfo Celi plays the films villain, Emilio Largo! He's SPECTRE nr. 2 and that's kinda cool! But he's just a middle aged man with an eye patch. When you compare him to the other Bond villains he's kind of a let down. Whatever, his performance is solid and he's an OK villain. But just OK. We don't really have an indestructible henchman, but we do have the femme fatale in the form of Fiona Volpe, portrayed by Luciana Paluzzi! She is one of the sexiest Bond girls in the entire series and she's a good actress! Her character isn't given much depth, but she's very cool! Desmond Llewelyn is awesome as Q, and Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell reprises their roles as M and Moneypenny, respectively.

Being too much of a rehash of the film, being too violent and over-the- top and having a flawed plot. Personally, I love the film for exactly what it's trying to be, a fun action film that give fans more of what they loved from the original. It's Christmas eve and once again, Detective John McClane must wage war against a team of terrorists. This time they've taken over an airport and have complete control over the planes above, one of which has McClane's wife aboard. The film lacks the tension that was present in the original. McClane is never really all alone and he never gets as brutal injured as he does in the first film. Instead the film feels like a race against time with McClane desperately rushing around the airport, capping off baddies and doing whatever he can to get the planes to land. It's still great fun and it's always a blast to watch McClane fighting against the odds.Die Hard 2 also feels a lot more mechanical in it's story telling. Renny Harlin does a decent job but never reaches the excellent standards of McTiernan. The supporting cast doesn't feel as three dimensional as they did in the first film and the gritty realism is somewhat watered down this time. Even the writing isn't as tight this time round.But these are just minor flaws, in fact I consider it to be one of the best action films of the 90s. The film-makers made the film because of the originals success so they basically tried to give the fans more of what they wanted. The action and stunts are well shot and very fun to watch. The villains are colder than the original's and while not as memorable, are still a very believable threat. Bruce Willis is still in his prime and gives another charismatic performance. Also, while Harlin may have stumbled here and there, the overall feel of the film is superb. The airport is still a familiar and charming setting for the film and the inclusion of setting the film during a blizzard is great. The heavy snow is not only a major plot point but it also adds to the Christmasy feel of the film as well as being another obstacle that McClane and the terrorists have to deal with on throughout the film. The finale is one of the best ever filmed for an action movie and I know this is an overused phrase but they really don't make 'em like they used to.Most of all the film has heart, while some say it's just a cold cash-in sequel, I still find it just as warm and as charming as Die Hard 1 and 3. It's still follows the elements that make a Die Hard film, unlike Die Hard 4, that felt like just another Bruce Willis film.

Five years later, once again in a King adaptation, she gave arguably an even better and more multi-faceted performance in the title role of DOLORES CLAIBORNE, a non-horror story about a woman's past and the daughter she will do anything to protect. She is aided and abetted here by great performances by the ensemble Jennifer Jason Leigh as the adult Selena, Dolores's daughter, a pill-popping, hard drinking investigative reporter who dresses all in black and whose entire affect is one of leave me alone; Ellen Muth as Selena at thirteen (a particular coup; much of this movie is told in flashback and the resemblance between Muth and Leigh is astounding); Judy Parfitt as Dolores's imperious employer, Christopher Plummer as a detective with an axe to grind against Dolores for something in her past; and the great David Strathairn as Dolores's alcoholic husband Joe. Yet this move failed to garner a single Oscar nomination, something I shall never understand.The flashbacks in this movie are perhaps the most arresting thing in it the story is memory, and what makes this film special is that the now is filmed in unrelenting shades of grimy grey, while the flashbacks are in brilliant color, a stroke of genius for director Taylor Hackford, as it delivers a powerful message that the past shapes us more than we even realize.Running through this film is the leitmotif Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto. Spoken by the adult Serena, Dolores's employer Vera Donovan, and Dolores herself, this is in many ways the central theme of the story the ways in which women are mistreated, judged, and often abused by the men around them. It is probably the most feminist story King ever wrote, a gritty and realistic tale about women taking care of one another and bonding together in defense against the various cruelties inflicted on them by the men in their lives.Bates is sensational in the title role; in many ways this is an even better performance than that which she gave in MISERY; it requires her to play a great deal many more notes, age something like eighteen years, and create a woman who is has become her own person through blood, sweat, and tears. Dolores is cranky, has a bit of a temper, and is eccentric in that there's always one in every small town kind of way. But not crazy. She is as sane as you and I (assuming of course that we are sane, but eye digress), and when faced with an abomination, she takes matters in hand out of sheer desperation. Yet to call her simply a victim would not be correct; she's tough, and she fights back. Fights dirty, too, when the need arises.Judy Parfitt as the snooty Vera is terrific; she gives the film a few laughs at unexpected moments despite the fact that at the end of the day she turns out to be the most tragic figure in the film.Perhaps the only member of the cast who can truly be called a victim is Selena at thirteen; Ellen Muth, a brilliant young actress, delivers the goods with a powerful performance that dovetails seamlessly with Leigh's portrait of the same character grown up. The adult Serena is better termed a survivor; she may overdo the booze and the pills, but she's still standing. Leigh is virtually flawless here.Special mention must be made of Christopher Plummer as the detective, so certain that Dolores has committed a murder that he enters the film with his mind made up. Condescending in the extreme, his final showdown, when it comes, is not with Dolores, but with Selena.And last but by no means least, the marvelous David Strathairn as Joe. Joe is a hateful character; he abuses Dolores both verbally and physically, and gets meaner when he drinks. Yet Strathairn somehow manages to make him rather a pathetic character; you might hate him, but you'll also pity him.This is a truly great film that was completely overlooked by the Academy.

Joe is a hateful character; he abuses Dolores both verbally and physically, and gets meaner when he drinks.

Five years later, once again in a King adaptation, she gave arguably an even better and more multi-faceted performance in the title role of DOLORES CLAIBORNE, a non-horror story about a woman's past and the daughter she will do anything to protect. She is aided and abetted here by great performances by the ensemble Jennifer Jason Leigh as the adult Selena, Dolores's daughter, a pill-popping, hard drinking investigative reporter who dresses all in black and whose entire affect is one of leave me alone; Ellen Muth as Selena at thirteen (a particular coup; much of this movie is told in flashback and the resemblance between Muth and Leigh is astounding); Judy Parfitt as Dolores's imperious employer, Christopher Plummer as a detective with an axe to grind against Dolores for something in her past; and the great David Strathairn as Dolores's alcoholic husband Joe. Yet this move failed to garner a single Oscar nomination, something I shall never understand.The flashbacks in this movie are perhaps the most arresting thing in it the story is memory, and what makes this film special is that the now is filmed in unrelenting shades of grimy grey, while the flashbacks are in brilliant color, a stroke of genius for director Taylor Hackford, as it delivers a powerful message that the past shapes us more than we even realize.Running through this film is the leitmotif Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto. Spoken by the adult Serena, Dolores's employer Vera Donovan, and Dolores herself, this is in many ways the central theme of the story the ways in which women are mistreated, judged, and often abused by the men around them. It is probably the most feminist story King ever wrote, a gritty and realistic tale about women taking care of one another and bonding together in defense against the various cruelties inflicted on them by the men in their lives.Bates is sensational in the title role; in many ways this is an even better performance than that which she gave in MISERY; it requires her to play a great deal many more notes, age something like eighteen years, and create a woman who is has become her own person through blood, sweat, and tears. Dolores is cranky, has a bit of a temper, and is eccentric in that there's always one in every small town kind of way. But not crazy. She is as sane as you and I (assuming of course that we are sane, but eye digress), and when faced with an abomination, she takes matters in hand out of sheer desperation. Yet to call her simply a victim would not be correct; she's tough, and she fights back. Fights dirty, too, when the need arises.Judy Parfitt as the snooty Vera is terrific; she gives the film a few laughs at unexpected moments despite the fact that at the end of the day she turns out to be the most tragic figure in the film.Perhaps the only member of the cast who can truly be called a victim is Selena at thirteen; Ellen Muth, a brilliant young actress, delivers the goods with a powerful performance that dovetails seamlessly with Leigh's portrait of the same character grown up.

This is done with a sequence of still images young boys in an English prep school, boys in a choir singing Kyrie Eleison, boys playing cricket, missiles, bombers, evacuation notices to the London airport, an atom bomb, a plane in the water. These images are inter-cut with a drumbeat soundtrack. No further back-story needed.Many serious themes are broached, the overarching one being to consider what would ensue if the thin veneer of civilization were stripped away. The ninety minutes of the movie follow Golding's book fairly closely and we get his take on the theme by following what happens to some thirty-odd kids on an isolated Pacific island. One of the boys, Ralph (James Aubrey), recognizes the need for organization and the need for a leader. A vote is taken and Ralph is elected, but another boy, Jack, is a rival. Jack, having been chief chorister at the school, gets all of the votes from the choirboys, but none others. Any relevance to contemporary politics is not coincidental. Initially things go all right, with tasks being apportioned Jack will be in charge of hunting and keeping a fire going as a signal to any possible rescue ships. Ralph will oversee building huts and making executive decisions. Soon a power struggle develops between Ralph and Jack and Jack gets the upper hand, since he is the main provider of food.If you are so inclined, allegorical meanings abound, offering occasion for endless analysis and speculation. Segments of modern society are reflected in the personalities of the main characters Ralph the reasoned leader representing civilization; Piggy, the intellectual, Ralph's friend and moral adviser; Simon the gentle, dispassionate truth seeker; Jack the militarist; Sam and Eric, the common man. The conclusion that savagery triumphs over good is depressing, but at least there is a recognition that there can be noble impulses embedded in our DNA. Jack makes a comment early on, After all we're not savages. We're English and the English are best at everything. The irony of that statement is appreciated as the movie moves along.The origins of religion are shown to be rooted in fear, and used by the group in power to their advantage. The corpse of an airman is found and it is mistakenly taken to be a beast shrouded in mystery and feared. Jack, recognizing an opportunity, offers protection from the beast and sacrifices pig's heads to feed it to keep it at bay. Since young kids have the least exposure to civilizing influences (read restraints), the implication is that we are all part brute--unfettered ego and the will to power are what make most things go bad.If you are not inclined to allegory or deep meaning, then you can see this simply as an adventure showing what might happen to a bunch of school kids when set loose without authority. Their relationships become pretty much what they probably were in school Jack, a closet bully; Ralph, a straight-up kid; Piggy, a fat intellectual who was picked on; Simon, a quiet thinker; Sam and Eric, congenial get along guys. They become who they truly are, which is scary to think about. I thought the child actors were quite good, especially for kids with little or no acting experience. They did not speak with great eloquence, they spoke as kids in a believable manner. Hugh Edwards makes a perfect Piggy. Aubrey plays the final scene with such emotion that it had a powerful impact on me; he communicates a sorrow bordering on despair. In that final scene he is made to look much older, which would indicate the effect his experiences on the island have had on him.Black and white is the right medium for this story, since it puts the focus on the kids and their faces. In color the kids would be overshadowed by the lush tropical island setting. The scene near the end where Ralph encounters the sailor is stunning in black and white. Panning up from the sailor's feet along the length of his brilliant white uniform is inspired. The spotless uniform offers a great contrast to the shape the kids were in.The score by Raymond Leppard is gently supportive while being mostly unobtrusive after the opening credits. The choir singing Kyrie Eleison as they march along the beach in their black robes will likely stick in your mind. Fragments of this song are repeated on several occasions throughout the movie. Leppard's score lets the tense drama unfold naturally without having to hit you over the head by what emotion you should be having.

Jackie Chan in his greatest adventure ever ! Jackie Chan and his bumbling sidekick (Tam) are sent on a quest through Europe to find a mysterious treasure held by a shadowy organization of monks . Here Jackie is a ex-member or a musical band , in fact , the musical sequence with the band The Losers is a spoof of the Hong Kong rock band The Wynners (they include Alan Tam, Anthony Chan, and Kenny Bee, all three appear in the movie). This Raymond Chow-Golden Harvest production deals with an adventurer , Indiana Jones-alike , and his partner , as two friends attempt to save the damsel in distress (Rosamund Kwan) , meanwhile they face off an evil cult . The pair join forces with the millionaire's daughter (Lola Forner who formerly acted in ¨Wheels and meals¨ or ¨Supercamorristas¨) . Jackie Chan plays an ex-singer-turned-fortune-hunter, whose ex-sweetheart is abducted by a sinister organization . An old friend of Jackie's, turns to him for help to rescue his lover ; they along with a female companion in tow set out in pursuit the nasties . Entertainment , comedy and amusement abound , culminating with a spectacular attack in the hideout fortress of the nasty band led by a monk and his evil thugs along with various leather-clad women.Chinese action comedy full of over-the-top struggles , thrills , ingenious stunts , laughs , slapstick , tongue-in-cheek and excitement . Here Chan plays an Indian Jones-style explorer who must find legendary suit of armour to rescue his ex-fiancée from a sect . This bemusing movie is packed with adventure , car pursuits , intrigue , unstopped action , overwhelming stunt-work and lots of fights but with abundant humor . Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous villains and as always he makes his own stunts like is well showed , though also contains numerous obviously cheated stunts . While filming the stunt where he leaps from a wall onto a tree, the branch Jackie Chan grabbed a hold of broke and he hit his head on a rock, nearly killing him and leaving him with a permanent thimble-sized hole on the right side of his head , the fall also left him hard of hearing in one ear . Watch the outtakes at the final to see the mishap that nearly wounded Chan . Awesome , incredible stunts and brief comic touches , as usual ; the picture is better constructed than Chan's predecessors films , including an ending battle in a cave is a knockout . The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times , marred by extremely silly spots , but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include spectacular brawls , car chases including bounds and leaps , impressive and interminable fights , a breathtaking final struggle between Jackie Chan and several monks and warrior women ; in addition other fine action sequences in overwhelming style . This is an acceptable action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences , and contains agreeable sense of humor as well as previous entries . Jackie Chan usually forms couple to notorious actresses as Maggie Chung and Michelle Yeoh and this time to Rosamund Kwan .This is a passable action movie distinguished by fight sequences , noisy action and packs silly sense of humor as well as Jackie's subsequent entries . This was the first of the Operation Condor movies, but was entitled Operation Condor 2 because it was released in the U.S. after the second film . The second part titled ¨Armour of God  Operation Condor¨ in which sends Chan off to Europe and Africa in search of enormous Nazi gold cache . The picture achieved enough success in China and around the world . However , Jackie Chan's failed at Box-office in his American debut ,¨Battle creek brawl¨ . Chan is a hard-working actor and director throughout his long and varied career . Jackie usually teams up to prestigious Chinese actor Sammo Hung , a fine action star in their own right and also had an American career as successful ¨Martial Law¨ TV series . Both of them starred together several films as ¨Heart of Dragon (1985)¨ which was directed by Sammo . Chan pays overt homage to two of his greatest influences as Charles Chaplin and Harold Lloyd . Jackie went on playing ¨Cannoball¨ , ¨The protector¨ and Rumble in the Bronx, until getting all American success with ¨Shangai Knights¨ , ¨The tuxedo¨ , ¨Around the world in 80 days¨ and ¨Rush hour¨ trilogy , and the recent ¨Karate kid¨.

Jackie Chan in his greatest adventure ever ! Jackie Chan and his bumbling sidekick (Tam) are sent on a quest through Europe to find a mysterious treasure held by a shadowy organization of monks . Here Jackie is a ex-member or a musical band , in fact , the musical sequence with the band The Losers is a spoof of the Hong Kong rock band The Wynners (they include Alan Tam, Anthony Chan, and Kenny Bee, all three appear in the movie). This Raymond Chow-Golden Harvest production deals with an adventurer , Indiana Jones-alike , and his partner , as two friends attempt to save the damsel in distress (Rosamund Kwan) , meanwhile they face off an evil cult . The pair join forces with the millionaire's daughter (Lola Forner who formerly acted in ¨Wheels and meals¨ or ¨Supercamorristas¨) . Jackie Chan plays an ex-singer-turned-fortune-hunter, whose ex-sweetheart is abducted by a sinister organization . An old friend of Jackie's, turns to him for help to rescue his lover ; they along with a female companion in tow set out in pursuit the nasties . Entertainment , comedy and amusement abound , culminating with a spectacular attack in the hideout fortress of the nasty band led by a monk and his evil thugs along with various leather-clad women.Chinese action comedy full of over-the-top struggles , thrills , ingenious stunts , laughs , slapstick , tongue-in-cheek and excitement . Here Chan plays an Indian Jones-style explorer who must find legendary suit of armour to rescue his ex-fiancée from a sect . This bemusing movie is packed with adventure , car pursuits , intrigue , unstopped action , overwhelming stunt-work and lots of fights but with abundant humor . Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous villains and as always he makes his own stunts like is well showed , though also contains numerous obviously cheated stunts . While filming the stunt where he leaps from a wall onto a tree, the branch Jackie Chan grabbed a hold of broke and he hit his head on a rock, nearly killing him and leaving him with a permanent thimble-sized hole on the right side of his head , the fall also left him hard of hearing in one ear . Watch the outtakes at the final to see the mishap that nearly wounded Chan . Awesome , incredible stunts and brief comic touches , as usual ; the picture is better constructed than Chan's predecessors films , including an ending battle in a cave is a knockout . The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times , marred by extremely silly spots , but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include spectacular brawls , car chases including bounds and leaps , impressive and interminable fights , a breathtaking final struggle between Jackie Chan and several monks and warrior women ; in addition other fine action sequences in overwhelming style . This is an acceptable action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences , and contains agreeable sense of humor as well as previous entries . Jackie Chan usually forms couple to notorious actresses as Maggie Chung and Michelle Yeoh and this time to Rosamund Kwan .This is a passable action movie distinguished by fight sequences , noisy action and packs silly sense of humor as well as Jackie's subsequent entries . This was the first of the Operation Condor movies, but was entitled Operation Condor 2 because it was released in the U.S. after the second film . The second part titled ¨Armour of God  Operation Condor¨ in which sends Chan off to Europe and Africa in search of enormous Nazi gold cache . The picture achieved enough success in China and around the world . However , Jackie Chan's failed at Box-office in his American debut ,¨Battle creek brawl¨ . Chan is a hard-working actor and director throughout his long and varied career . Jackie usually teams up to prestigious Chinese actor Sammo Hung , a fine action star in their own right and also had an American career as successful ¨Martial Law¨ TV series . Both of them starred together several films as ¨Heart of Dragon (1985)¨ which was directed by Sammo . Chan pays overt homage to two of his greatest influences as Charles Chaplin and Harold Lloyd .

The process included watching the full series of Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and Children of the Corn, and it was only a matter of time before my travels took me to The Omen.While watching the film (as well as writing this review) I've made sure to bear in mind that this was a film from the late 70's, when several aspects of the Cinema field have not yet developed, or at least not yet fully matured. For instance, what I've found to be most blunt, has been the acting. Throughout the film I haven't been able to not notice that the actors appear to be acting for the sake of acting, rather than to try and appear realistic and assist suspense of disbelief (very much like actors in musicals and plays in the theatre, who act like actors in a play or musical rather than like real characters). Furthermore, the struggle scenes (weather with other characters or beasts) all appear very unrealistic. And lastly, little Harvey Stephens, while adorable and precious, simply failed to frighten me in any way...Much of that criticism is probably due to the time the film was screened, when the a woman hanging herself, a man having his head chopped of and the very thought of children being possessed by the devil were enough to startle, unnerve and even shock an audience. Add to that the fact that I happen to be Jewish and not Christian, and you might understand why The Omen didn't really leave such an impression on me.However, having said that, if I do take consideration of the time the film was screened, I can very well understand how groundbreaking and innovative it must have been, and how many spectators have probably been really frightened by it. The story and script were good, the poor lighting and visual effects were probably (yet again) fine for the 70's, and the ending probably had people on the edges of their seats.All in all, I'm afraid I've been born too late and am too young to be able to fully appreciate The Omen, one of the masterpieces of the genre.

A key plot point in the opening sequence is never addressed, and in turn what we're left with is a supernatural unresolved story, leaving this audience member scratching his head.The film revolves around a condemned man and his restitution to the public, if it could ever be characterized as that. We are made privy to the operations of condemned men in the South, and those who keep watch over them. As I sat there and watched the film, and as entertaining as I found if, I was still curious as to how the situation, the characters and audience find themselves in, came to being. But, as I say, it is never addressed by the film.Therefore the film is a kind of ambiguous setup and story, which is designed to leave you with a sense of wonder via your own imagination. And I guess that's why I found it entertaining, but dissatisfying all at once. It's not a film I'll ever wantonly see again.Technical points; it's a first class production. There are no faults here in execution. This is A-quality commercial film making at its finest. The one fault that prevents me from liking the film is the writing. The whole premise and setup upon which this film is based is left blank. And, if this is not addressed nor otherwise explained, then how on earth can the rest of the film hold together? Simply put, the writer asks you to believe in the supernatural based on the opening scenes and the fate of the main characters. But, even if we're asked to believe in things that cannot be proved, the whole setup, a real situation, is never addressed to begin with. And, if this is so, then how can we invest ourselves in the rest of the story? Again, the fault of the author.All in all an interesting film, but not one that really held my interest in any regard (I was forced to watch the thing three times while on vacation).

There's so many things we can relate with, whether puberty, disappointment, denial, rage, anger and we have a brilliant cast of a actors to demonstrate these feelings and emotions, the first one to spring to mind, is Philip Seymour Hoffman, an amazing actor, who's dull, apathetic voice fits his flawed, semi psychotic, lonely shell of a man, who stalks women by telephone, using smutty messages, and I'm not even gonna tell ya what he does with postcards. This is just one character. Most of them have issues, but with the rest, whose lives may seem picture perfect, they too aren't content. But what is Happiness anyhow. Is there such a thing? Basically this 140 minute movie I love, that never seems like 140 minutes, is set around the lives of three sisters, and people they associate with, whether family, new loves, stalkers, other sick puppies, dumped ugly guys, etc. The only person who's really all together, until a shocking revelation throws her world into a hundred and eighty degree spin, is the oldest of the sisters. Life's pretty peachy creamy for the second oldest too, but fame can come at a price, while the youngest, a lonely budding singer\/guitarist, in need of you know what... is quite a mess. While watching this movie it'll jangle some nerves, touch upon sensitive spots, in scenes that are all too real, some may be too real, where we keep relating with more of them as the movie progresses. It's as if reality keeps kicking back at us, like a drug. That's it's genius. One scene reminiscent of Port Arthur, and thank god this was just an imaginary scene, has disturbed psychiatrist (Dylan Baker), strolling through central park, gunning down people at random, with an A-47, where at the end of it all, he seems totally disaffected. Like this scene, a couple of other scenes go a bit too far, some of them involving pedophilia, but these recurring issues, we can't turn blinders too. Happiness is a sheer 1999 masterpiece, and deserves it's place among that year's top ten films. Though it's not for all tastes, or may'be even more accurately put, it may just be for acquired tastes, this movie will leave you shocked, sickened, where you may even feel the need to vomit, OR you may just find it inspirational and that itself is rewarding. I know the latter is a hard concept to grasp, but you have to read between the lines, and realize that out there in the big lonely world, there's always gonna be someone, who's far worse off than you.

I know the latter is a hard concept to grasp, but you have to read between the lines, and realize that out there in the big lonely world, there's always gonna be someone, who's far worse off than you.

It's sick, shocking, funny, sad, inspiring, provocative, controversial, evocative, disgusting, the list goes on, but like the emotions listed above, most are negative, some touching places you don't won't to go. There's so many things we can relate with, whether puberty, disappointment, denial, rage, anger and we have a brilliant cast of a actors to demonstrate these feelings and emotions, the first one to spring to mind, is Philip Seymour Hoffman, an amazing actor, who's dull, apathetic voice fits his flawed, semi psychotic, lonely shell of a man, who stalks women by telephone, using smutty messages, and I'm not even gonna tell ya what he does with postcards. This is just one character. Most of them have issues, but with the rest, whose lives may seem picture perfect, they too aren't content. But what is Happiness anyhow. Is there such a thing? Basically this 140 minute movie I love, that never seems like 140 minutes, is set around the lives of three sisters, and people they associate with, whether family, new loves, stalkers, other sick puppies, dumped ugly guys, etc. The only person who's really all together, until a shocking revelation throws her world into a hundred and eighty degree spin, is the oldest of the sisters. Life's pretty peachy creamy for the second oldest too, but fame can come at a price, while the youngest, a lonely budding singer\/guitarist, in need of you know what... is quite a mess. While watching this movie it'll jangle some nerves, touch upon sensitive spots, in scenes that are all too real, some may be too real, where we keep relating with more of them as the movie progresses. It's as if reality keeps kicking back at us, like a drug. That's it's genius. One scene reminiscent of Port Arthur, and thank god this was just an imaginary scene, has disturbed psychiatrist (Dylan Baker), strolling through central park, gunning down people at random, with an A-47, where at the end of it all, he seems totally disaffected. Like this scene, a couple of other scenes go a bit too far, some of them involving pedophilia, but these recurring issues, we can't turn blinders too. Happiness is a sheer 1999 masterpiece, and deserves it's place among that year's top ten films. Though it's not for all tastes, or may'be even more accurately put, it may just be for acquired tastes, this movie will leave you shocked, sickened, where you may even feel the need to vomit, OR you may just find it inspirational and that itself is rewarding.

I've finished watching The Omen not two hours ago, and I must say I haven't been entirely impressed (even when taking consideration of the facts it's over 30 years old). However, I must say The Omen II has been pleasantly surprising!Unlike most reviews I've seen, I've found The Omen II Damien to be far, far better than the first one on virtually all accounts (even if it has been made only two years after). The acting is better, more convincing and realistic (although the actors still seem too emotionless about all the deaths of their friends and relatives). The story and plot are better and less predictable. To top it off - there's even a twist towards the end, one that caught me completely off guard!Of course, the film isn't perfect. The greatest shortcoming is still the main character, Damien (this time played by Jonathan Scott-Taylor). While doing a much better job than Harvey Stephens in the first film, the character of Damien is still not as frightening and unnerving as it should be, in my opinion.What I might have neglected in my previous review is the music - which is one feature in which the first film is better than the sequel. However, in all other aspects - The Omen II is one of the best sequels I've seen, and a fine well done film. I'd recommend it to any Horror fan and\/or late 70's films fan, but do watch the first film first, as it will make you enjoy this one all the more.

I've never seen A Christmas Story on TV or in stores in the UK. I doubt many people outside of the US know who Jean Shepherd is, or of his popular Ralphie Parker character. In fact, most people in general won't know that this movie is actually the fourth of (currently) seven featuring Ralphie.Adapted from the book In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash, a collection of mostly Christmas-themed short stories, it remind me a lot of Christmas Vacation (adapted by John Hughes from his own Christmas '59 short story) in that it seems semi-autobiographic. But the adaptation of several stories gives the movie a sketchy feel, with a few that failed to resonate with me.The main story has little Ralphie Parker (brilliantly played by Peter Billingsly), a kid with imagination and cynicism beyond his years, beg his parents, and Santa, for a BB gun while dealing with a series of eccentric events in 1940s Indiana. It made me laugh quite a lot, but mainly in the second half. The cosy Xmas atmosphere is lovely, and there's not a shred of anything unwholesome. But I just can't see myself making this an annual tradition.I am sure many will disagree, but it does make me curious about checking out the other Ralphie Parker movies.
