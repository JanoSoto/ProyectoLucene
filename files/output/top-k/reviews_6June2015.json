For many that movie experience will come at a young age and in a dark theatre where the large screen envelops you in a whole new world you never thought possible. For me, like many of my generation, that film was Jurassic Park. Of course I liked many movies before that point but it opened my eyes to the potential of the medium like no other film, before or since. Scorsese talks about the religious-like experience cinema can create in its audience and watching Spielberg's classic for the first time I can fully appreciate what he means. It instilled a sense of reverential awe in me and whilst I had witnessed fantastical places like Oz and Tatooine I had never truly been transported to a foreign world as I had with Jurassic Park.It's a hard film for me to talk about rationally. It holds such a special place in my heart that I will never be able to find fault with the film, so instead I'm just going to gush about the movie's many positive attributes. Attributes like the groundbreaking special effects. The film is always assured of its place as one of the great technical achievements in cinema. CGI had been used in films for many years before but never quite to the point that you believed wholeheartedly in the events and creatures on screen. It is remarkable to think how far computer graphics have come since 1993 yet the film still looks utterly convincing, even more so than both of its inferior sequels. I can only put this down to the seamless blending of effects from the use of CGI, model work and animatronics. The film constantly tricks the audience into believing the dinosaurs were real by having creatures the cast could directly interact with. Because CGI has become so advanced now filmmakers rarely rely on the other types of effects work yet without them Jurassic Park's major moments would never have worked as well. Just imagine the T-Rex scene with the children trapped in the car, it is frighteningly believable because the creature is really there. Much of the critical attention is given to the computer wizardry but for me Stan Winston and his team are just as crucial to the film's success.Whilst the story is little more than a reworking of Westworld it is still so taut and full of genuinely magical moments that any familiarity in its conceit is immaterial. I can think of no other film with quite so many memorable sequences. The movie is packed with them, big or small, from the reverberating cup of water to the first dinosaur reveal, it is a film that has created more indelible memories than most filmmakers achieve in their entire careers. The cast are, with the possible exception of Laura Dern, perfect for their respective roles. When you compare it to a lot of modern blockbusters the film is surprisingly small in scale. Sure, you've got giant prehistoric creatures stomping around but the film doesn't have a sprawling cast of characters and it has no end-of-the-world climax. Yet it is the narrow focus that makes it all the more effective. Each character is given time to develop and whilst they may fulfil defined roles in the story they do at least feel like real and believable people. Jurassic Park may be a theme park but the film is more than just a thrill ride as you feel emotionally invested in the characters and events on screen.I've waffled on and not even mentioned the brilliant score by John Williams (a score so amazing it still sounds fantastic when slowed down by 1000%) or the film's perfect balance between comedy and scares. The film is a masterclass in blockbuster filmmaking and a bona fide classic.

This is the kind of movie we so often dislike but for me, this isn't dislikeable and is actually an OK piece of film, a kind of give it a go kind of movie. The whole show is pretty well made and no one can deny the stunts involved aren't fantastically done, and the plot is actually not half bad at all.Brian O'Conner(Paul Walker) is a cop racing in street races, trying to infiltrate racing gangs and the like, and to be fair Walker does it kind of nicely. I did feel out of the main cast that Walker feels the most uncomfortable, but he still manages to lead the movie out well enough. Vin Diesel as the gang leader Dominic is OK too, he actually outshines everybody here and his acting skill really comes through for me here, proves what he has in the locker.Rob Cohen directs this a bit OK, not great but he steadies it, the film could have been more on point at times but nevertheless he still catches the right feeling the script gives off. And on that note the film Is written much the same, missed opportunities here and there and massive cheesy lines can harm it, but I think by the end of the story, your hooked on the adrenaline junkie action, rather than the wording choices. The movie has a glitzy look about it, this is Hollywood through and through and yet that doesn't matter, it feels raw enough to be believable and the stars of the movie are not famous enough for this to be yet another big budget action thriller movie, that tries too hard to be cool. The cars are for me not that nice, the one thing that really gets annoying after a while is bright green cars etc with racing stripes of fire, the cars go fast and this is good for petrol heads, but the look of it is pretty awful.I said about the stunts and there is no denying the stunts are good, there not gravity defying like so many of the sequels(Fast and Furious 7 has just left cinemas at the time of this review), they are well done and basic, sure the effects used in the cars whilst racing is ridiculous, but the fast crashes and kind of crazy things that go on, make this exciting and personally I enjoyed it quite a little bit.You know I hear a lot of people claim this is only for the boys, but please disregard that, not only it being sexist but also that this actually contains depth in the story, not just mindless racing. I mean the depth is pretty high up, this only just scrapes the surface but it still has more than the cars. I felt the plot which I will not ruin for those who haven't seen, is good and it makes this kinda fun but at the same time thrilling, you honestly don't know what will happen, and although the story does play out rather basic, It still contains a fun story.Overall this is one fast paced movie I can recommend, now don't be won over by it like so many can, this honestly isn't a masterpiece of any kind, but still worth a view. I didn't feel bored at any times, all my focus was on the characters and how they develop and I think that you too can enjoy it, If you focus on one particular part, and not the cheese that this movie truly is.

Of course, in the history of cinema it probably won't be talked about in the same terms as other 'classics,' such as The Godfather and Empire Strikes Back. 'Wild Things' is a different type of film for a different type of audience.It's a twisty-turny thriller where you can't really say too much about the plot without giving away important information that is best left kept secret until you actually watch it. Basically, it involves plenty of glamorous (and murderous!) back-stabbing, by beautiful people in beautiful locations. If you've watched the trailer (and I suggest you don't, seeing as that too gives away more than you really need to know) then you'll see that there's a strong 'sexual element' to it. Therefore, critics can easily dismiss the film as just some (slightly classier) p0rn and leave it at that.Yes, sex is an important part of 'Wild Things,' but, like I say, it's so much more than that. Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon, Neve Campbell are all great, but, for me, the stand-out performances come from Denise Richards and Bill Murray. Murray normally turns in an excellent performance in whatever he does, so you'll probably expect it from him. However, since Wild Things, Denise Richards has taken more than her fair share of criticism concerning her acting abilities. I can tell you though she shines here (and I'm not just talking 'visually!') and even gets what I would say is the best line of the film &#x96; something about 'taking the car,' but you'll have to watch the film to see the context she uses it in.If you're not offended by plenty of sex in a film and you like your films with more plot twists in than a filmic corkscrew, then give Wild Things a go. Just be sure to sit through the credits for added scenes which explain a lot of what's happened (when I first saw this in the cinema, I noticed that some people actually left the moment the screen went black &#x96; they really missed out!). Also, don't watch the sequels &#x96; I mean it &#x96; just don't. They're basically the same film, only done worse and if you've seen the original you'll have seen it much better.

His view of the U.S. politics and his realist touch is present in any of his films (and screenplays, look up Scarface-1983). So, when talking about this director, it's either you love him or you're not interested in his message. But he has voice, he has the raw energy and the impulse to make a change, be it social, political or in the film industry. Platoon is a very personal movie. Simply put, it's a must watch. The reasons for me saying this are  I am very fond of war-movies placed in the 20th Century since all the major conflicts of the modern era created the world as it is today, and you will find this one to change your perception about the Vietnam-War that you thought you knew; if you want to see Charlie Sheen's best portrayal of his life you might want to check out this movie; there are a lot of young actors (at the time) in incredibly convincing roles; you have Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger as opposite archetypes; you have intense fight scenes with an outstanding cinematography; the movie is filled with likable characters and even some funny moments and, to top it all - there is compassion, realism and a true sense of revelation through insight present in the story! The fact that the director himself was a soldier in Vietnam (his first film - in 1971, is about his experience) provides a knowledgeable geometry of feelings about the subject - War in all its vast, vicious and vulgar splendor. The good guy Chris (Sheen's character) is transformed by the horrors he witnesses, by the people he meets and most of all, by the decisions his fate seems to have taken for him - to be a part of this infernal conflict that seems to consume the spirits of everyone involved. This is a movie best watched alone, for you to analyze it in detail and to allow it to leave its mark upon your perception, because that is what it does. I would compare it to The Deer Hunter or Full Metal Jacket in its nerve-shattering effect of how a man, noble in thought and kind in action, is a participant in an abominable, absurd yet absolute conflict that will forever change his universe. For a mature viewer, with plenty of time to digest and discuss it, Platoon is one of those rare films that show us the true extent of our violence, vanity and visceral impulses. Man cannot conquer the world if he can't even conquer himself. I give it a 9.8 out of 10. Enjoy!

Whereas the first film gave you a sense of wonder about the dinosaurs, this one here takes that and goes full steam ahead and pretty much delivers a horror film. I've often criticized the director for playing things too safe but that's certainly not the case here because this is a rather dark, mean and at times violent film. I still remember watching this on opening night and dozens of parents removing their crying children from the theater because it was simply too scary for them.It should go without saying but the real star here are the dinosaurs themselves, brought to life by Stan Winston and his wonderful creations. There's not a single second in the film where you feel as if you're not really watching dinosaurs and it's this authentic feel that makes the film work. If you didn't believe that there weren't dinosaurs around the actors then there really wouldn't be any suspense or drama. The CGI creations all look 100% real and they mix well with the human actors. The live action and CGI mix flawlessly together but this here has always been one of Spielberg's strongest points as a director.Another major plus is the fact that the final hour of this thing is pretty much one long non-stop action sequence. As I said earlier, this is pretty much a horror film from the middle point on and no one is safe. This includes children, dogs and anyone else that gets close to the dinosaurs. I really loved the fact that Spielberg went all out and really tried to scare the audience and show that these dinosaurs weren't any game and that they could be extremely dangerous. Whereas the first film showed their danger, there were several moments where you just knew everything was going to turn out okay and be safe. That's not the case here because everyone was at risk and the action sequences were directly perfectly.Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Attenborough, Vince Vaughn and Pete Postlethwaite are all good in their roles but, again, the real stars are the dinosaurs.

His review was the first that rang a bell with me and he presents the basic theme of the movie very perceptively and concisely.Let me throw in my sixpennyworth here If you know something of the history of the making of this film it helps to understand it.When the film company looked at what Hopper had they freaked and said that no one would understand it and they forced him to cut the film down to 90 minutes.Now, the worst part Hopper had shot A LOT more footage and this just got thrown in the garbage! Imagine, when the days of 'director's cut' came around Hopper could have restored footage and made a film of 100 or 110 minutes or whatever! Now, those people who moan that the film is 'slow-moving' and 'nothing happens' or that the cinematography is 'boring', well, they certainly wouldn't appreciate a longer movie! I guess they've been spoiled by the frenetic cutting of MTV and modern action films! But for us who love the way it's paced... it would be magic!

To stay in keeping with the title, they gave him a mad hairdo. Granted, you'd have to be mad to want to look like Tina Turner, so I guess it's legit. They also cast that very lady in the role of villain. Mad, isn't it? But wouldn't you believe it - at that particular point in history she was bigger than Mel Gibson. Somebody thought this combination would be bankable. However, there's too much Tina Turner in Aunty Entity (!) to fool you into buying into her character and she quite grabs the attention away from the titular character and the plot. Maybe it's for the better because Max didn't look like having much to do other than getting beaten up and saving some hippie kids, and there was barely a plot to speak of.The end result, expectedly, looks like an extended Tina Turner video.

Many of the haters of The Lost World wouldn't be able to answer that question. Meanwhile, I believe that Spielberg and Koepp found the right way to go about it, and created an delightfully ominous sequel with enough substance that it can proudly stand beside the original.The Lost World is noticeably different to the first, which Spielberg, Crichton and Koepp deserve credit for. They haven't just remade the first one all over again. They've brought back the stuff we loved - water vibrations, the wonderful score, Jeff Goldblum - and added plenty of new stuff so that this film can stand on its own.I love the feel of The Lost World. There is some terrific tension, some outstanding drama and I never once felt that I was watching a set - its a real place. Two of the greatest scenes in the film are Sarah on the glass, and the slow ruts carved in the grass as the raptors close in. Its so tense and yet beautiful in its simplicity. My absolute favourite scene are Eddie's attempts to rescue Nick, Sarah and Ian from the trailer. Everything that can go wrong does go wrong. And when the T-Rexes show up to attack Eddie, I groaned in sympathy, for what else could possibly go wrong? Even the jump scares in this movie were effective.What always set Jurassic Park aside from its popcorn thriller counterparts is its wonderful cast. The original had a beloved trio of characters and even beloved minor characters like Robert Muldoon. This film takes that formula and even manages to improve on it. Kelly isn't as good as Lex and Tim, but the writers made a wise choice in focusing on Ian Malcolm as the film's protagonist, wheras the previous film sidelined him for most of the movie. Of the new additions, I loved Julianne Moore as Sarah, Vince Vaughn was surprisingly believable as Nick, the ever-underrated Richard Schiff is terrific as sardonic Eddie Carr, and Arliss Howard strikes the perfect note as the villainous Peter Ludlow. He isn't diabolical, but rather snobbishly set in his ways, and he fits the film perfectly. But by far the best character in the film was Pete Postlethwaite's Roland Tembo. His opening monologue sold me on him before he even got halfway through it. He's fast-talking, knows what he wants and doesn't suffer fools. I would have loved to see more of him. The VISUALS of this movie! I never fully appreciated the animatronics of Jurassic Park until I saw this film as well. The highest compliment I can possibly offer is that the dinosaurs look real. I could touch them and I can tell what they'd feel like. A small dinosaur headbutting a car door, and a T-Rex chomping on a traffic light are the two highlights of just how seamlessly the visuals blend with the reality. These days, the dinosaurs would be 100% computer animated, and that is a dreadful shame, because present day films can't capture even a fraction of the wonder of this film.Yes there are a few flaws. The opening scene raised the stakes so high, until John Hammond reveals that the young girl survived. Not only is this completely unbelievable (when looking at Dieter's fate later in the film) but it makes the opening scene obsolete. They should've just told the story without showing us, because the appeal of Jurassic Park is its ominous tone.At times, the camera cuts away from crucial moments, but considering that they were limited to what they could create at the time I can forgive it. Dieter's death is the most obvious example - he runs behind a log and gives up the fight instantly so he can die off camera. Yes the gymnastics scene was a bit silly, but I didn't mind in the scheme of things. The T-Rex stomping through San Diego felt both tacked on and required a huge suspension of disbelief (no one hears it stomping around) and there are a few major plot holes (namely, if the T-Rex devoured the crew of the ship, why was it still trapped? A deleted scene was meant to show that raptors did it, but then where did they go?)But I won't end on a low.

We had Episode I, The Matrix, Wild Wild West, and this.Now, whilst the three other movies are remembered more for various reasons, this has since been a bit of a forgotten oddity, and seeing it nearly sixteen years later, its clear as to why.Not only did the film try to reboot the old Universal horrors of the early twentieth century, it also pseudo tried to be the new Indiana Jones, and this is the film gravest mistake. Fraser is great as O' Connell, but at times he just becomes too cocky for his own good and comes across as a bit of a moron. The comedy elements are there, Hannah is particularly hammy as the comedy sidekick, but a lot of the humour is very ethnically based, especially when Djalli is in the frame.The effects were pretty groundbreaking at the time, and the film was all about spectacle, rather than narrative, but alas, the effects have aged as badly as the titular creature, and you realise again that the actual movies narrative is based around the next special effect set piece Sommers has to give us.But it's still a lot of fun, the three leads have wonderful chemistry together, Vosloo is great as the villain, and despite it being fifteen minutes too long, it's a fun ride.

The idea behind this movie is amazing and everything just works perfectly. Much of the original cast is back and even Wes Craven himself is in it. I think the reason why a lot of people don't get this movie is because it kinda stays away from what the series became (cheesy, funny) and Craven created something a lot darker that many people didn't expect. So New Nightmare doesn't have any memorable Freddy kills. So what? The ideas of the movie are executed with amazing directorial precision and it is wildly entertaining. Also, this movie feels a lot more like a Scream movie than a Nightmare one, it could even be considered a prelude to Scream, one of my favorite horror movies, as both explore the idea of bringing horror movies to life. Also I found the many homages to the original fantastic, good job Wes Craven! You can also tell by many things in the movie and knowing what the director originally intended to do with the character of Freddy Krueger (before the studio made a few terrible cheesy sequels) that this was a passion project and Craven really gave this project his heart, and I respect that. The ending with the beautiful music, for example with Craven's note on the script thanking Heather for being Nancy one last time, nearly brought a tear to my eye. The last 20 minutes get a little out of hand and over the top, in my opinion, but in the end I will say Wes Craven's New Nightmare is an amazing piece of work and if you love the original and horror movies in general, please approach this with an open mind and I know you will enjoy it. I personally think it is the second best in the Nightmare series right after the original.

Well it does have a massive pie fight near the end.The film came out a few weeks after the similar themed Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines. Having watched both recently, the Magnificent Men has stood the test of time better.Director Blake Edwards is inspired by Laurel & Hardy which clearly shows in the comical scrapes that Jack Lemmon and his side kick Peter Falk get into.Lemmon and Curtis are daredevils although Lemmon is the dastardly kind and Curtis is the dashing heroic one. They compete in a New York to Paris car race which Lemmon is hell bent to disrupt by nobbling his rivals. Natalie Wood takes part as a suffragette reporter who competes as well as covering the race for a newspaper and is the romantic interest for Curtis.The film starts as a promising farce. There is a sequence involving Tony Curtis free falling before he opens a parachute which I swear was later borrowed by the James Bond producers. Its all very wacky races, there is even a Penelope Pitstop but it just goes on and on including a subplot involving a doppleganger that looks like Lemmon who is a crown Prince of a European principality.I think Blake Edwards decided to end it all in a giant pie fight but then remembered that he had a race to finish in Paris so on and on the film goes.Wood's Suffragette feminist character actually gets to be grating and holds the picture up. Curtis is a little too subdued, one of the reasons the film's release was delayed was because the production schedule overran. Too much partying by the cast and crew and its reflected in some of the acting. Lemmon gets to play two roles but his Professor Fate cackled too much for my liking but he and Falk blend wonderfully.The film would had been a classic if 40 minutes was shaved off the running time.
