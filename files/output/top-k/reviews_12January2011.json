Computer generated effects were not nearly as prevalent or as easy to pull off as they are today, and because of these facts, this movie is a really interesting piece of cinema history. And at the time, the effects were amazing, sort of like how many feel about Avatar today, but is this film really one of the best of all time? I'm going to say no, and in addition to that, the original Terminator which was done on a much smaller budget is a better film.So, it's been 13 years since the first Terminator, and Sarah Connor is now in an insane asylum after all of her nonsensical ramblings of Terminators got too much for people. Her son John Connor is living in a foster home and he's now a hoodlum. To top off all these wacky family dynamics, a reprogrammed Terminator is sent back in time to protect John, who, in the future, is the leader of the war against the machines. Sent to kill John is a T-1000 model shape shifter Terminator disguised cleverly as Robert Patrick in a cop uniform. After various plot developments, Sarah Connor decides she must assassinate the man who created the original Terminator so all of this could end. Chaos ensues.To start with the positives, this movie has some awesome action scenes. A motorcycle\/bus chase in a drainage ditch is a pretty cool way to kick start the action in this picture. The special effects for the time are amazing, and still today, they look good. The characters are likable enough to get the audience rooting for them. Even Arnie as a robot gained audience support in his programmed quest. The movie at times, is funny, and many one liners that might have come off as corny, come off as tongue and cheek amusing. The final 20 minutes or so of the film are really good, and make up mostly for the middle lag. And Robert Patrick plays an excellent villain. His uncaring stare is very menacing.The negatives...well, how about that John Connor? Edward Furlong gave a good performance, but, perhaps they could've given the kid less corny lines of dialogue. From time to time, the kid came off as irritating, completely due to the dialogue he had to work with. The first half of the movie is really good, and action packed, and interesting to see how Sarah copes with living in the nut house. When Sarah decides to go kill Terminator creator Miles Dyson, the film goes downhill. Why exactly? Hard to say. Sarah Connor is only doing what she can to save the world, but she becomes somewhat unlikable here, and after the long opening where she and John meet up for the first time in several years, she leaves again. And she didn't even seem that happy to see her son, the supposed savior of the human race to begin with. It almost seemed as though when the T-1000 went off for long periods of time, the movie became slightly less interesting. And I'm not one who wanted Mr. Patrick on screen all the time, it just wasn't as exciting, and the characters weren't well written enough for the amount of time they were given for development (except for Arnold). The only specific scene that really irritated me was when John called for help as the Terminator grabbed him. He's screaming for help, and then when two guys come up to help, John chews them out. What a little punk. This boy who cries wolf better watch out or he's going to get killed by people trying to help him.

But in fact they are rather different films, even though a few scenes are quite similar. The more loosely filmed, less elegant, and rather clumsier Purple Noon is admired for exactly those qualities. It is not the 1999 highly (highly!) polished, superbly acted Anthony Minghella movie by any stretch, and yet, in most views, it is the better movie.But not to me. It's worth avoiding too much of that which is better comparison by remembering that the early film is distinctive as it spends much of its time as a kind of elevated mind game between to very good looking young men. They spar, they taunt, they find a kind of liberty and discovery in the ways they push each other to be something unexpected, even dangerous. This is developed in quick snippets as we go, but you get the sense of it more fully in a couple of longer scenes, and then eventually on the beautiful yacht where the crisis from their derring do comes to a head. Once Tom Ripley takes full control of his destiny, and Mr. Greenleaf's, we see that he is not, actually, the brilliantly deceptive and disarming Mr. Ripley in Minghella's film. That is, he isn't the talented Mr. Ripley at all, but a young man who barely avoids catastrophe time after time in his plot to take over Greenleaf's identity. He does succeed, to a point, but the constant dodges and role playing of Matt Damon's character are less the point here. This is more the picture of someone in slightly over his head.Alain Delon is certainly a pretty boy actor, a kind of cleaner, and more French, James Dean (who was already 5 years dead by this point). I can see how people prefer his version of Tom Ripley, because it's more likable the way any pretty rebellious and slightly dangerous boy is likable. In a way, I admire Damon simply because he wasn't such a paradigm. His flaws showed. It's Jude Law in the later film who is the pretty boy, playing Mr. Greenleaf, and in the earlier French version we have Maurice Ronet, who at least has the advantage of looking a lot like Delon.There are some weird flaws in Purple Noon. One I couldn't accept at all was when Ripley calls Greenleaf's girlfriend, Marge, pretending to be Greenleaf, and Marge can't tell the difference. There are also touches in the later film that add to the complexity of it all--the addition of another woman, the greater presence of Freddy Miles (played in both movies by rather similar men), and the inner struggles of Ripley. Further, there is an authenticity to the American (later) film for the unavoidable reason that the characters are Americans in Europe, which they are (though Jude Law is British, a small point). In Purple Noon the characters are still American, with American names and histories and passports, but of course the look, act, and sound like they are French. Understandable, but odd in some larger view. There is also a wonderful sexual undercurrent in the later film missing in the first--the idea that Ripley is homosexual and doesn't know how to access those feelings, or how to come out to Greenleaf about it.Both films are beautifully filmed, this one far more simply, lacking the huge resources of Minghella's enterprise. That makes Purple Noon more gritty at times, and if it sometimes seems to cut corners (the market scene as the same woman in a blue dress in the background too many times), it is also more direct and less lofty, which is good in its own way. Jazz makes a brief appearance here, but nothing like in Minghella's version, where you might say the music takes over too much at times from the plot.

Was there any sort of outward message being presented in this sordid tale of greed, deception, backstabbing and violent behavior? And in the end, was this simply a spin off of Goodfellas? Many would disagree, claiming that Casino is an entirely different kind of Scorsese film, concerned more with the city of Vegas and its surroundings than anything else. Indeed, the first two hours fly by as Scorsese whisks us through the casino and its behind-the scenes facts. Long famous for the energy and spontaneity of his films, Scorsese's fluid camera snakes in and out of rooms, eavesdropping on the conversations of some of the highest and most powerful men in Las Vegas, some of which don't even live in Nevada. As in Goodfellas, there is innumerable amounts of information given. In fact, there are so many voice-over narrations going on one right after another, some may get dizzy trying to keep them all straight. All this, combined with fiercely intense performances from Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci make this a great two hour run. Unfortunately, this is a three-hour film.The last hour of the film, for me, bears many marks of Scorsese's labor of love for these settings and subject, yet it feels to drag on and on and on. Never have I seen one hour go by so slowly that was directed by such a great filmmaker. Indeed, the main reason for such slow pacing is the fact that practically the same thing happens in every single scene. For the first two hours, Scorsese sets up nearly ever character for some sort of payoff or consequence. Now, the payoffs must come. They do, one right after the other and it is not only boring to watch but also painful. As with any Scorsese film, the bleakness and desperation of the situation is not shied away from. It is difficult to watch the relationship between De Niro and Stone crumble, in effect mirroring the mob's relationship with Las Vegas fall apart. Nevertheless, by the end, I was left feeling somewhat unsatisfied and cold with all these characters. Not a single one can truly be empathized with, and in the end all get what they deserve.I know it is unfair to Scorsese to compare this film with Goodfellas, but there are so many parallels that it is hard not to.

Was there any sort of outward message being presented in this sordid tale of greed, deception, backstabbing and violent behavior? And in the end, was this simply a spin off of Goodfellas? Many would disagree, claiming that Casino is an entirely different kind of Scorsese film, concerned more with the city of Vegas and its surroundings than anything else. Indeed, the first two hours fly by as Scorsese whisks us through the casino and its behind-the scenes facts. Long famous for the energy and spontaneity of his films, Scorsese's fluid camera snakes in and out of rooms, eavesdropping on the conversations of some of the highest and most powerful men in Las Vegas, some of which don't even live in Nevada. As in Goodfellas, there is innumerable amounts of information given. In fact, there are so many voice-over narrations going on one right after another, some may get dizzy trying to keep them all straight. All this, combined with fiercely intense performances from Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci make this a great two hour run. Unfortunately, this is a three-hour film.The last hour of the film, for me, bears many marks of Scorsese's labor of love for these settings and subject, yet it feels to drag on and on and on. Never have I seen one hour go by so slowly that was directed by such a great filmmaker. Indeed, the main reason for such slow pacing is the fact that practically the same thing happens in every single scene. For the first two hours, Scorsese sets up nearly ever character for some sort of payoff or consequence. Now, the payoffs must come. They do, one right after the other and it is not only boring to watch but also painful. As with any Scorsese film, the bleakness and desperation of the situation is not shied away from. It is difficult to watch the relationship between De Niro and Stone crumble, in effect mirroring the mob's relationship with Las Vegas fall apart. Nevertheless, by the end, I was left feeling somewhat unsatisfied and cold with all these characters.

I remember being indifferent to it and remember me preferring the other popular horror of the year, The Ring. Having seen it again after 8 years, I can say it is a strong, effective, and emotionally resonant film.The writing in the film is superb. Shyamalan builds effective scenes with some great dialogue that only benefits the characters more. His direction is also impressive. He make the story itself be creepy and mysterious without showing too much, and that ultimately is what makes this a great film. At first I didn't think I would be able to say it was anything more than a good film, but it is great. The atmosphere and tension is first-class, and in that way it seems already as one of those old classic thrillers. The performances are also great, especially from the two youngsters. Abigail Breslin is of course an Oscar nominee now but still seeing her acting range at this age is marvelous. Rory Culkin also is very impressive, as is Phoenix. Mel Gibson I am mixed about and actually think was the weakest link here. Of course, knowing Gibson's reputation now does not help but I still say he was solid.Overall, it is a great film, and despite many saying it is not horror, it IS. It handled the subject of another alien existence in a very restrained and different way. The climax is done very well, but the visual effects and the fact that they somehow still did what we didn't really need them to do is probably a backtrack.

Sometimes (often?), those who love it will dismiss those who hate it as simply not getting it. This attitude is not only snobbish, it maybe even misses the point of the picture. 2001 A Space Odyssey is not really a picture that one must get. Its plot is not exactly labyrinthine, and while its meaning is obscure it is deliberately so, as Kubrick himself shied away from being philosophically explicit. In other words, if someone tells you they know what Kubrick was trying to say with the movie, they are wrong.So what exactly is the problem then? Contrary to what some might assume, it is not the slow pace of the picture that I find alienating. Certainly there are dozens of pictures with faster paces and shorter runtimes that I find far more boring because they are unconvincing, too wordy or just generally poorly executed. In fact it is the methodical pacing that gives Space Odyssey many of its best points. Take the early scenes with the apes - not a shot is wasted there. It is in fact an extremely efficient summary of the brutal and dangerous lives of these creatures, all told with an atmospheric quietness, building up to the eeriness of the monolith's appearance and the stylised bone-smashing scene. The following spaceship sequence, choreographed to the Blue Danube waltz is graceful, balletic and quite beautiful to behold. Later, the scenes with HAL and Keir Dullea become a kind of space horror, with the long shots and mechanical noises adding to the creepiness. There's also great tension built up by having the scenes of Dullea trying to get back on board through the airlock played out in painstaking real-time. And it is the achingly slow process of HAL being shut down that helps to make it such an intensely poignant sequence.So 2001 A Space Odyssey is, for the most part, an expertly rhythmic motion picture, and from its rhythm comes its power and its emotion. Where the problem comes, and I think the point where most of the audience is lost, is in the final act. When we are sitting through a ten minutes of lights zooming past, colour-filtered landscapes, and weird avant-jazz noises, the picture has lost its sense of aesthetic beauty, and gone into the realms of artistic pretension. No-one can really enjoy this sequence. Some might claim to appreciate it, and yet it is clearly a tonal piece with little actual meaning, so there is nothing really intellectually pleasing about it either.I have to admit though, a lot of my dislike for this picture is only relative to the adulation lavished upon it by its fans. It irks me that the match-cut with the bone and the spaceship is so widely applauded, when there is an almost identical (and far neater) cut in the Powell and Pressburger picture A Canterbury Tale, and besides there are better (but more subtle) match-cuts in Space Odyssey, such as the one from the monolith against the sky to the shadow on the plain. And I'm a little cynical about the fuss made over the scientific accuracy of the space flight stuff, when the picture is so unscientific about Darwinian evolution. Don't get me wrong; I'm not citing the match-cut or the scientific inconsistencies as problems in themselves, only pointing them out as examples of the sometimes misguided way in which this movie is seen as being exceptional. Perhaps then what 2001 A Space Odyssey suffers from is its own reputation. Considered in itself, the picture has a great deal to love about it and only a little to hate.

A rift eventually develops between the senior sergeant, Barnes (Tom Berenger), and the junior sergeant, Elias (Willem Dafoe); the former a veritable indestructible killing machine and the latter an expert soldier who refuses to allow the horrors of war to rob him of his humanity.Platoon is masterful movie-making in practically every way and towers over most other Vietnam war flicks, with the sole exception of Apocalypse Now (the original version). What works best is the ensemble cast and the numerous memorable characters who all smack of real life -- Taylor, Barnes, Elias, Lt. Wolfe, O'Neill, Bunny, Junior, King, Rhah, Crawford, Tex and Big Harold (amongst others). The idea that any filmmaker can effectively bring to life a dozen or more characters like this in a 2-hour film is uncanny to say the least.Memorable moments abound, including - After stumbling upon a just-abandoned Vietcong nest where a soldier comes up missing, the platoon finds his corpse staked-up down the river and the camera slowly pans across the visage of practically every platoon member culminating with Barnes, who mutters with seething vengeance. This is a potent scene spotlighting a band of American warriors, from very diverse racial\/ethnic\/socio-economic backgrounds, forced together halfway around the world in some God-forsaken jungle to face an enemy of jungle wraiths.- After the Barnes\/Elias fight at the village Barnes is informed by Captain Harris that there will be a full investigation. Barnes leaves the meeting and walks by his two disciples O'Niell and Bunny. O'Neill asks Barnes if there's going to be an investigation. The laconic Barnes stops but doesn't answer; he just looks away, as if in thought, smoking his cigarette. The camera stays on Barnes while Bunny responds O'Neill, man, you worry to much; the sergeant will take care of him. Looking at Barnes' countenance you just KNOW he's contemplating murder. The scene is filmmaking of the highest order.- In a dugout six of the soldiers who sided with Elias discuss what to do after it appears Elias had been shot by Barnes in combat. They all want to kill the scarred-face Barnes, but Rhah reveals Barnes' stature with the men is nigh mythological at this point; he's been hit seven times and still isn't dead. Barnes ain't meant to die! The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes. A shirtless Barnes suddenly appears, drinking a bottle of whiskey; apparently he heard the whole conversation. He boldly confronts all six with a fascinating rant (I am reality) and challenges them to kill him. None of them take the bait because they deem him a human tiger, except Taylor, who's no match for Barnes in man-to-man combat. Although Barnes is the villain in the film you can't help but admire his sheer boldness and killer skills; it's clear why the men respect and fear him.By contrast, Elias is the compassionate, loving and righteous Christ-figure. If there's any doubt to this it's bludgeoned into the viewer via the melodramatic and unrealistic death scene, which can be (slightly) excused on the grounds of its iconic imagery (the cover of the DVD) and obvious symbolism. This scene is the only reason I rate the film 9\/10 rather than 10\/10.Bunny (Kevin Dillon) is an interesting character. He's young, simple and likable but the war morphs him into a nigh-psychotic killer, so much so that he seriously creeps the other men out. But, again, he somehow maintains an amiable charm, unlike Tex who comes across wholly venomous.Some have criticized that it's impossible to make a war film that's anti-war on the grounds that war films by their nature make war seem fun in an adventurous way. Not so with Platoon. How did Stone accomplish this? Well, aside from skillfully showing the hard day-to-day life of infantry men in the jungle, the combat scenes are viewed from the grunt's disoriented perspective where, often, there are no clear battle lines of good guys\/bad guys (even within the platoon itself!); the enemy -- ghostly figures who are never clearly seen -- can come from any angle. Anything can and does happen, at anytime. Stone denies the viewer the feeling that this type of jungle combat makes sense. Needless to ask, how can anyone go through such without being inwardly scarred for life? Some criticize the flagrant cussing but Stone was shooting for realism; I know from experience that this is generally how grunts talk. I don't know about you but, if I'm going to see a war film, I want to see the awful truth, not some cleaned-up fantasy BS.The ending shows that Barnes & Elias are figurative of flesh & spirit, the conflicting forces within us all. (SPOILER) Taylor reflects, The war is over for me now, but it will always be there the rest of my days, as I'm sure Elias will be, fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called 'possession of my soul'. There are times since I've felt like a child, born of those two fathers. But, be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know, and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and a meaning to this life.

A rift eventually develops between the senior sergeant, Barnes (Tom Berenger), and the junior sergeant, Elias (Willem Dafoe); the former a veritable indestructible killing machine and the latter an expert soldier who refuses to allow the horrors of war to rob him of his humanity.Platoon is masterful movie-making in practically every way and towers over most other Vietnam war flicks, with the sole exception of Apocalypse Now (the original version). What works best is the ensemble cast and the numerous memorable characters who all smack of real life -- Taylor, Barnes, Elias, Lt. Wolfe, O'Neill, Bunny, Junior, King, Rhah, Crawford, Tex and Big Harold (amongst others). The idea that any filmmaker can effectively bring to life a dozen or more characters like this in a 2-hour film is uncanny to say the least.Memorable moments abound, including - After stumbling upon a just-abandoned Vietcong nest where a soldier comes up missing, the platoon finds his corpse staked-up down the river and the camera slowly pans across the visage of practically every platoon member culminating with Barnes, who mutters with seething vengeance. This is a potent scene spotlighting a band of American warriors, from very diverse racial\/ethnic\/socio-economic backgrounds, forced together halfway around the world in some God-forsaken jungle to face an enemy of jungle wraiths.- After the Barnes\/Elias fight at the village Barnes is informed by Captain Harris that there will be a full investigation. Barnes leaves the meeting and walks by his two disciples O'Niell and Bunny. O'Neill asks Barnes if there's going to be an investigation. The laconic Barnes stops but doesn't answer; he just looks away, as if in thought, smoking his cigarette. The camera stays on Barnes while Bunny responds O'Neill, man, you worry to much; the sergeant will take care of him. Looking at Barnes' countenance you just KNOW he's contemplating murder. The scene is filmmaking of the highest order.- In a dugout six of the soldiers who sided with Elias discuss what to do after it appears Elias had been shot by Barnes in combat. They all want to kill the scarred-face Barnes, but Rhah reveals Barnes' stature with the men is nigh mythological at this point; he's been hit seven times and still isn't dead. Barnes ain't meant to die! The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes. A shirtless Barnes suddenly appears, drinking a bottle of whiskey; apparently he heard the whole conversation. He boldly confronts all six with a fascinating rant (I am reality) and challenges them to kill him. None of them take the bait because they deem him a human tiger, except Taylor, who's no match for Barnes in man-to-man combat. Although Barnes is the villain in the film you can't help but admire his sheer boldness and killer skills; it's clear why the men respect and fear him.By contrast, Elias is the compassionate, loving and righteous Christ-figure. If there's any doubt to this it's bludgeoned into the viewer via the melodramatic and unrealistic death scene, which can be (slightly) excused on the grounds of its iconic imagery (the cover of the DVD) and obvious symbolism. This scene is the only reason I rate the film 9\/10 rather than 10\/10.Bunny (Kevin Dillon) is an interesting character. He's young, simple and likable but the war morphs him into a nigh-psychotic killer, so much so that he seriously creeps the other men out. But, again, he somehow maintains an amiable charm, unlike Tex who comes across wholly venomous.Some have criticized that it's impossible to make a war film that's anti-war on the grounds that war films by their nature make war seem fun in an adventurous way. Not so with Platoon. How did Stone accomplish this? Well, aside from skillfully showing the hard day-to-day life of infantry men in the jungle, the combat scenes are viewed from the grunt's disoriented perspective where, often, there are no clear battle lines of good guys\/bad guys (even within the platoon itself!); the enemy -- ghostly figures who are never clearly seen -- can come from any angle. Anything can and does happen, at anytime. Stone denies the viewer the feeling that this type of jungle combat makes sense. Needless to ask, how can anyone go through such without being inwardly scarred for life? Some criticize the flagrant cussing but Stone was shooting for realism; I know from experience that this is generally how grunts talk. I don't know about you but, if I'm going to see a war film, I want to see the awful truth, not some cleaned-up fantasy BS.The ending shows that Barnes & Elias are figurative of flesh & spirit, the conflicting forces within us all. (SPOILER) Taylor reflects, The war is over for me now, but it will always be there the rest of my days, as I'm sure Elias will be, fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called 'possession of my soul'. There are times since I've felt like a child, born of those two fathers. But, be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know, and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and a meaning to this life.

Scott. Eddie is a hustler who uses his talent in pool for money, and he's ambitious enough to challenge the living Gods of the green table during high-stakes matches. His boyish smile and way of talk creates the perfect harmony between arrogance and vulnerability, both inspiring fear and sympathy, anything but suspicion. Paul Newman makes his role so believable that in no way, one can guess he's a hustler, which makes him a pretty good one. So Eddie makes money to challenge the big ones and when it comes to play the game for real, he believes in one thing  winning, and winning big time. So does Bert, a businessman, who believes in one and only one sacred principle  whatever you do, never lose your money. And this is what the whole movie is about, winning and losing.Watching The Hustler is like an introspection into the whole concept of a game. What's the purpose of a game ? For the common majority, we play, we might lose or win, but we're entertaining ourselves and having fun. But for a small minority, there's no fun, no entertainment except if this leads to one thing  winning. Eddie belongs to this minority, and not only does he believe in winning, but it must follow the opponent's rules. It's over if the opponent says so. Winning doesn't count, it's the way you win. A winner has an attitude, he just doesn't win. For one thing, it's hard for us to disagree, since we don't know many lame winners, they all have this little something inspiring our fascination, our disdain but never our indifference. Eddie can't afford the attitude of the winner because as a potential winner he might be, he still carries the attitude of the loser, who's unconsciously always looking for an excuse. It's less the attitude of a loser than the attitude of the winner who wants to win so bad whatever he does, he loses. What Bert calls 'character' is attitude without efficiency. Eddie still has to learn from Minnesota Fats who plays and wins in a cool, detached elegance beautifully embodied by Jackie Gleason like a tailor-made tuxedo. There's indeed a gracious coolness in Fats's attitude  whatever Eddie lacks, Fats probably incarnates it. It must be the wisdom, the capability of knowing when to stop. The passion, the ferocious desire to win consumes Eddie's mind so much, he can't even realize when he's losing. Gordon notices that, and uses a provocative approach to tempt Eddie to work for him to get rid of this inner enemy, this 'character' in order to challenge Fats again, and win this time. But this character is something much deeper, transcending the context of the game. It's a blinding passion and egomania, making Eddie an eternally unsatisfied man, incapable of seeing happiness when it crosses his road. This is Eddie's tragedy.And this tragedy is incarnated by one character. Sarah Packard, played by Piper Laurie. Sarah is like a talentless Eddie's alter ego, a woman spending her life pretending to study, to be what she is not, filling the emptiness of her life as she fills a glass with alcohol. Alcohol fills her life, gives it a taste, makes her forget that she doesn't have anything else to do. Alcohol acts on her like pool on Eddie, with the same burning power, and that's why they understand each other, why their romance seem so realistic and natural. But I'm a bit unfair towards Sarah, she does have a talent that Eddie lacks  she knows what love is. She knows she loves Eddie who's too blinded by his ego to realize it, and when he does, it's too late. Seeing Eddie dealing with this relationship with the same ego than he does for pool, makes you realize how the old Bert was right. And the born loser statement sounds like the premise of a tragedy. Losing a game is one thing, losing the woman of your life is another.The love story between Eddie and Sarah is the soul of The Hustler and the tragedy in which Bert played a significant part, a heart-breaking conclusion. Bert believed in winning money, Eddie in winning a game, Sarah in winning by not losing the most precious things. And she's the one who got the true meaning of the word. If Eddie asked himself only once, what's the most valuable thing for him, and for Bert, maybe the tragedy could have been avoided. Sarah was like Eddie's therapy and so was he. When his thumbs were broken, they ironically became a perfect couple, and you could see Sarah's bitterness when she saw his hands healed. She declares her love but she needs the words but Eddie can't admit loving as much as losing, his character is too strong, and like I said, that's his tragedy.This is the tragedy of Fast Eddie Felson, probably one of the most fascinating character studies ever made with my favorite game as a backdrop.

I saw this a few days ago but I couldn't find my premise to begin to discuss something about it. Contempt is aware of itself as a movie, more so than Breathless, and it's aware of the meta-narrative that hovers outside the body of the movie in an effort to perceive the mechanics of it. The approach is dialectic, between Fritz Lang the poetically minded director and Jack Palance the crass controlling movie producer, inbetween the two a film about a film is struggling to be formed. The problem for me here is Godard's expression, is he poking fun or is he in earnest, or both at the same time? When he has Jack Palance say I like gods or everytime I hear about art, I take out my chequebook has he said too much already? And when he has Fritz Lang say that it's enough to feel god close to us or that we should return to an objective perception of the world as is does he similarly snicker? He may very well be but the film feels like it's more than just satire, that it's trying to be serious about something, not just that art can imitate life or the opposite, but perhaps that the two are only removed by the presence or absence of a camera.I like the intellectual qualities of the film, as an exercise on what cinema can be. I like the use of a film about a film device because it mirrors life, perhaps too expressly though, or more precisely not life as we know it but life as we know it from the camera. But if Godard glosses over in satire the appeal of power or art, if both are silly aspirations, what does that say about his own film, of his own story about a husband and wife falling out of love? The few dailies we see of the film Fritz Lang is preparing for Jack Palance are meant to look silly, to reveal the contrivance of art, but what about his own shots of ancient Greek statues, his long shots of people walking and talking? If art is a folly, what does that say about Godard pursuing it in the first place? This ultimate irony for me only comes back to bite Godard in the ass.Or the scene in the cinema where a young talentless singer gives an awful rendition of a popular Italian song for the benefit of Jack Palance. Like the dailies of Fritz Lang's film, Godard seems very keen to point out the bad art in others, to mock the effort. Powell and Pressburger held art as a mirror for life in The Red Shoes but they reveled in the art, Godard on the other hand condescends it. The troubling thing for me is that when the husband lets Brigitte Bardot ride on the fancy car with Jack Palance and she takes off with him, Godard gives us one of the ten best cuts in movie history.

There's a shot where Bardot is framed against a blue sky on the top of a Capri villa, she leaves the shot and her husband enters it.

I saw this a few days ago but I couldn't find my premise to begin to discuss something about it. Contempt is aware of itself as a movie, more so than Breathless, and it's aware of the meta-narrative that hovers outside the body of the movie in an effort to perceive the mechanics of it. The approach is dialectic, between Fritz Lang the poetically minded director and Jack Palance the crass controlling movie producer, inbetween the two a film about a film is struggling to be formed. The problem for me here is Godard's expression, is he poking fun or is he in earnest, or both at the same time? When he has Jack Palance say I like gods or everytime I hear about art, I take out my chequebook has he said too much already? And when he has Fritz Lang say that it's enough to feel god close to us or that we should return to an objective perception of the world as is does he similarly snicker? He may very well be but the film feels like it's more than just satire, that it's trying to be serious about something, not just that art can imitate life or the opposite, but perhaps that the two are only removed by the presence or absence of a camera.I like the intellectual qualities of the film, as an exercise on what cinema can be. I like the use of a film about a film device because it mirrors life, perhaps too expressly though, or more precisely not life as we know it but life as we know it from the camera. But if Godard glosses over in satire the appeal of power or art, if both are silly aspirations, what does that say about his own film, of his own story about a husband and wife falling out of love? The few dailies we see of the film Fritz Lang is preparing for Jack Palance are meant to look silly, to reveal the contrivance of art, but what about his own shots of ancient Greek statues, his long shots of people walking and talking? If art is a folly, what does that say about Godard pursuing it in the first place? This ultimate irony for me only comes back to bite Godard in the ass.Or the scene in the cinema where a young talentless singer gives an awful rendition of a popular Italian song for the benefit of Jack Palance. Like the dailies of Fritz Lang's film, Godard seems very keen to point out the bad art in others, to mock the effort. Powell and Pressburger held art as a mirror for life in The Red Shoes but they reveled in the art, Godard on the other hand condescends it.

He has pretty seedy friends too. They get together and plan to pull an armed robbery of one of the clubs. The robbery is to be one of those suspenseful, precisely timed jobs in which some little thing always goes wrong and holds up the plan. The cops, not unfriendly types, are vaguely aware that something is up and an Inspector even warns Bob to stay clean. (He's been in the pen before.) Two somethings go awry in this story. The first of them is Isabelle Corey, a blond dancer at a nightclub and sometime lady of the evening, or rather early morning, when the clubs are shutting their lights off and the streets are still filled with drunken sailors.Isabelle Corey is a friend of Bob le Flambeur. I called his friends seedy before, but it would be a mistake to call Isabelle Corey seedy. Not a bit. No seeds here. She's more like a red, red rose that's newly sprung in June. Her hair is long and invitingly tousled, her eyes often downcast, her expression shy, her arms and most of her chest usually bare, and she seems to shiver slightly when she moves. And she doesn't seem more than slightly put out when somebody slaps her for being naughty. My kind of woman! Lamentably, one of the gang of thieves is Paolo and Paolo has a big mouth. He tells Isabelle Corey and Isabelle mentions it to somebody who talks to the police. Hearing of this, Bob le Flambeur is aghast. But, ever the optimist, he figures maybe it didn't penetrate to the proper ears within the gendarmerie. No Frenchman should ever be so optimistic. They should be like Mexicans, fatalistic to a fault.The second thing that goes wrong is that Bob le Flambeur is supposed to be an inside man at one of the casinos. He's to meet the rest of the gang at just about the hour of closing and they will make a coordinated attack on the confused and befuddled casino staff.But Bob le Flambeur is, after all, a flambeur and hanging around for a couple of hours in a gambling house, doing nothing but watching, proves to be impossible for him. So, putting aside for the moment any thoughts about his rendezvous with the others, he places a small bet. Winning, he places a larger bet. Continuing to win, he moves from roulette to the bacarat table. The bills pile up to a considerable height in front of them and he never bats an eye as the money accumulates. Robbery? WHAT robbery? In most movies of this sort, especially during the 1950s, this is the point at which the hero loses all on a single bet, steps outside to meet his destiny, and is plugged by the other gang members, for whom some sins are unforgivable.Not here. Jean-Pierre Melville is not that kind of a director and not interested in such a tragic story. It suddenly occurs to Bob that he has a robbery to pull off but by the time he rushes outside, the gang have been stopped in their tracks by the cops. Knowing he was implicated, they put the cuffs on Bob too.But as Bob sits in the police car, the staff of the casino bring out all his winnings, enough to keep him in clover for a long time. With the right lawyer, muses one police officer, you could get only a few years. With a better lawyer, another thinks, you could get a suspended sentence and no time at all. Bob le Flambeur looks into the camera and says that with the best of lawyers he could sue for damages and walk away with still more loot.This sounds like a comedy but it's all played straight. A narrator somberly keeps us informed of Bob's actions and thoughts. Nobody laughs. Nobody even smiles. Melville was a neat guy, amiable and polite. He took his name from the author of Moby Dick. And he was a friend of Margaret Mead, about whom he made a delightful short documentary, when they were both old. In the last shot of that documentary, Melville is holding the camera and walking backward away from the Venerable Mead. Bye-bye, Margaret, he calls. Mead smiles and waves her hand, growing smaller in the distance, Bye-bye, Jean. More sweet and satisfying than Bob le Flambeur but both films reflect his engaging personality.

So if you haven't seen part one you can pick this up without a problem, but if you have seen part one then it's better that you fast forward until th e pre-credits. But again, Friday the 13th part two had his problems, a lot of the gore was cut out and was never seen afterwards. The two scenes where you can feel the cutting is the spear going through a couple. You see the spear going towards the bodies and you never see it going through the bodies. They had to cut that out. So the gory shot was left out! The ending should have been the decapitated head of Mrs Voorhees smiling but it looked ridiculous so the left that one out and didn't have a real ending, so again, they freezed on her head and edited it with the end credits. But it also takes over 40 minutes before things really starts. The first killing is after 30 minutes but again, nothing really happens, okay, a nude scene is given to keep you watching, but the killngs aren't gory, and Jason wasn't scary at all. You have to wait until part 3 to see the hockey mask. It was told that part two had a larger budget and more gore but due the problems it's just a bad entry into the franchise. But do catch the Deluxe for the gory story as an extra and the interview with the writer of Crystal Lake Memories The Complete History of Friday the 13th.

The fact that it's been forgotten is a probably a good thing seeing as how it is about the only film in its time that hasn't been remade or isn't currently being targeted by Michael Bay or anyone else who would do it harm. In a way, House is a cult classic that is destined to stay a cult classic forever, and there are many reasons why.The first reason lies in its plot structure. To say the film's biggest weakness lies in its sloppy story-telling would be an understatement; at times, the film flat-out makes no sense. There are no rules when it comes to the supernatural elements of the story; therefore, the film gets away with murder, so to speak.Another reason would be its quirky sense of humor, achieved by its assorted cast. William Katt plays the straight man against the nosy and over-bearing neighbor, played by George Wendt of TV's Cheers. On the other side of the coin, Richard Moll (he being of Night Court fame) plays the chief bad-guy, glorious special effects make-up job and all, disguising his usual persona all while adding to further amusement when he fails in harassing his former war buddy.Then, of course, we have the creepy yet amusing practical effects which define the film. The monsters or ghosts or whatever you'd like to refer to them as appear to be straight out of someone's nightmare, resembling nothing seen before and often achieved by something as simple as a latex mask. You'll giggle yourself silly as you watch Katt's character struggle with the skanky-looking goblin his ex-wife becomes. The laughs are derived partly because the scenario is so over-the-top and silly but also because the effects by which it is executed are just too good to be true and reminiscent of a time when horror movies had a certain authenticity to them, even when they didn't take themselves too seriously.Rather than go any further into analyzing the film and why it should remain an '80s relic, it must be said that House is simply a boat-load of good times. Director Steve Miner (Friday the 13th Part 2 and 3-D)) truly comes into his own with the film, which is both stylish and competently paced (too bad the director crapped out in the '90s). Meanwhile, William Katt carries the film on his shoulders, giving a performance that is both manic and sympathetic. Somewhere amidst the horror and the humor lies a story of redemption, and Katt somehow sells it. Although the film never quite settles on a specific tone or makes much sense throughout, it's still an enjoyable film that will deliver chuckles and jumps time and time again. It's certainly not a film for everyone, and that's the point. For those who prefer their horror off-beat and with a sense of humor, you'll found House to be worth entering.

So let's get the bad stuff out of the way before I tell u why I recommend watching this film at least once in your life&#x85; The aspect that I found the most surprisingly disappointing is the sound. Here I am only commenting on the English version of the film and maybe the German version is much better. The sound just does not flow and this partly because the ADR and Foley jar as the acoustics never match what we see on screen. The dialogue always sounds like it was recorded in a sound proof booth and never on location. The sound track has poorly executed fade outs and jump cuts. The quality and insistent hiss are difficult to forgive, even for 1979. Think 1960s Spaghetti Western recorded on VHS. And yet, just like the Spag Westerns there are some great sound moments &#x96; much of the music is very atmospheric and I felt it actively advances the audiences understanding of what is being shown on the screen. It just needs a major remixing to flow.The quality of the acting (with the exception of Klaus Kinski) was fairly mechanical. Maybe I was missing the point, but the way the reacted to the various events tended to be artificially late and over theatrical. Was this supposed to be reminiscent of the silent era or was it just poor &#x96; maybe you should decide for yourself. The English dialogue they had to work with was not well written and not well delivered. English would not have been the actor's mother tongue so maybe it works much better in the German version. And yet&#x85; and yet, all this odd acting &#x85; I cannot say it actually detracted as much as it should. In fact I found it gave the whole thing a strange atmosphere which may have even matched the mood of the film.There visual side of the film is better, if occasionally inconsistent. Always visually interesting and unconventionally shot, it never loses interest. The historical anachronisms are so grating that I chose to consider them as part of the surreal texture of the film.The way the film is edited did not really impress me. It gave me the impression of being assembled rather than cleverly edited. I generally like a occasional lingering shot of a beautifully \/ cleverly framed subject that give me time to ponder what the director is trying to communicate, but some shots lingered long, long, long after they had ceased to advance the plot or visually stimulate. For example, there is a shot of a wall where actors had exited stage left several seconds ago and a panning shot of a stage coach lasting 40 odd seconds before cutting to two more ponderous shot of the stage coach's stately procession. OK, I admit, it was a nice castle wall and beautifully framed stage coach set against stunning backgrounds&#x85; And yet despite what sounds like condemning criticisms, I did find the film compelling. I am not going to criticise the plot as although it is minimal, it is sufficient. Dracula films frequently avoid over elaborate plots as they don't seem to need to tell a long story to take us on a thrilling journey to the world of vampires. Despite the inconsistent editing, poor sound and unusual acting styles, for me it really did have a unique and compelling atmosphere.Then there is Klaus Kinski. Dracula has been played by countless actors, but I think Klaus Kinski really succeeded in getting as close as possible to showing us something truly original while still being recognisably Dracula. This is a really creepy Dracula and while I found the persona revolting I did catch myself feeling some sympathy. Klaus played Dracula more like an instinctive creature than an evil human and so it is very impressive I could still identify with this ghastly wretch. There was never even the remotest chance of someone stealing the scene while Klaus is in shot. Maybe the so-so acting of the supporting cast serves the film well in making Klaus' brilliance all the more impressive?

Taking place three years after the events of the first film, the sequel finds Charley Brewster a little older and a little wiser. Thanks to some therapy, Charley no longer believes in vampires and is trying his hardest to move on with his life, which includes his college studies, a new love interest (Traci Lind) clinging to his side and a gnarly mullet to boot. Unfortunately, just as things start getting back on track for our hero, a gang of vampires comes to town seeking food, a good time, and some good old fashioned vengeance. It's up to Charley and the down-on-his-luck Peter Vincent to once again put a stop to the madness.Directed by Tommy Lee Wallace (Halloween III Season of the Witch), Fright Night Part 2 is somewhat lacking in the charming spirit of the original. While Wallace (a John Carpenter protégé) puts on a good show with the aid of a fog machine and an excellent score by the great Brad Fiedel in tow, the film can't help but succumb to sequelitis. While the character of Charley may have moved on, his routine certainly hasn't. Even though the film makes an effort to not repeat the events of the first film, it can't help but slip into redundancy with a been there, done that vibe running throughout. It also doesn't help that this new gaggle of baddies lack the charisma of Chris Sarandon and come across as less of a threat than they do a cast of rejects from Michael Jackson's Thriller video.It's not all bad for this sequel, though. On the plus side, Wallace keeps the pace quick and easy. Reuniting with characters from the original film is a treat and it's nice to see their characters expanded upon as well. Both Ragsdale and McDowall are on their game and it shows in the final product as the two whole-heartedly carry the film. Traci Lind makes for a slightly less interesting love interest than Amanda Bearse in the original, but has a likable energy about her that makes one wonder why her career never took off. All in all, Fright Night Part 2 is an enjoyable if flawed re-entry into familiar territory.

THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE 8,3 or something. the script & dialogue is pure genius, Val Kilmer gets sucked by his character, you could swear hes not Val, amazing performance by all actors indeed, except for 2, watch it and see if you could figure them out ;) go watch it guys, you wont regret it.

This time around Bruce Willis is again the odd man out, the only survivor of a fatal train crash who begins to suspect he owes his life to something more than mere serendipity. Is he an accidental plaything of fate, or (believe it or not) an unsuspecting comic book superhero down on his luck? A little more ambiguity might have added some necessary tension to the far-fetched scenario, but from the first frame the issue is hardly in doubt, and as a result the obligatory surprise ending (around which the entire film revolves) is unfairly deflated, trading the compelling supernatural hook of its predecessor for an intriguing but esoteric Twilight Zone plot twist demanding a more laborious suspension of disbelief.Writer director M. Night Shyamalan maintains the same somber, self-conscious style that so effectively marked his earlier film, with long meaningful pauses separating every portentous line of dialogue, and a deliberate editing scheme favoring suspense over easy shock tactics. It's refreshing to find a moviemaker not enslaved to Hollywood's current hyper-kinetic visual fads, but it's also safe to say the pacing flags at more than one point Rod Serling could have told the same story just as well in less than 30 minutes. An economic, two-character cast (Willis, plus Samuel Jackson as his crackpot guide to reluctant enlightenment) makes the whole thing look not unlike a student screen writing exercise, pulled out of Shyamalan's old college trunk and hastily dusted off to help keep his suddenly hot career from losing any momentum.
