Well, Shanghai Noon has it all. The script is well written. The action scenes are worth the ticket alone. Owen Wilson was perfectly cast for this part... adding more comedy than Chris Tucker did in Rush Hour. I was happy to see that many of the odd moments incorporated into Chan's films were left out. Such as extremely stupid bad guys, those cartoonish faces the bad guys make when getting hit and just the plan bad stereotypes his enemies always seem to be modeled after. My only complaint of this movie is that some of the action scenes had too many cuts. The sheer fun of a Jackie Chan movie is watching him do his thing with a minimum of cuts during the scene. He moves too fast to fully appreciate his ability in a scene with too many cuts. However, this is made up with one spectacular scene in the end. I saw this movie at a sneak preview which was sold out. When the final credits rolled, the audience cheered and applauded. Odd as it is to say, I was quite proud of Jackie... he deserves this movie.

Look at me Greg Kinnear (of 'As good as it gets' fame) tries his best in this movie. He says his lines with such conviction, it's almost sad. Laurie Metcalf is as good as she always is as the neurotic lawyer-cum-postal worker Rebecca. Greg Kinnear's character, Tom Turner is...is...heck, I've run out of positive stuff.I'm sorry. It's just that this movie tries to tackle a subject matter far bigger than itself. And it does it, well, badly. Let me walk you through itTom Turner is some professional scam artist, who has a gambling debt. He is conning poor innocents out of their cash, until he gets busted by completely unbelievable undercover police officers more trigger-happy than Dirty Harry. He gets the completely unbelievable court order go to jail, or get a 9-5 job for a year. He gets a job through two completely unbelievable happenings, involving his cousin being the policeman dragging him out of a post office cue (presumably for noticing the deadly secret of the post office that even though there are huge lines in the post office, there is one register open with nobody using it, which Tom just walks up to).He gets a completely unbelievable job in the 'Dead Letters Office', which is a huge messy office, filled to the brim with letters, with 5-6 full-time workers. These work on the mail that has been adressed wrong so it can't be sent on. We're supposed to believe that there are so many sloppy letter senders? Oh, never mind. Tom discovers a place with a lot of left over jewellery, sent nowhere, and he pockets it ALL, even though he's been told he's watched. Sadly, he's rumbled, so he puts it ALL into a FedEx package and mails it. Not to himself, oh no, but to some random adress he found on a letter to God. You know, for a professional conman, he's pretty stupid. The only guy more stupid than him is the mail sorter that doesn't notice a fully grown man sliding down his mail chute one foot away from him. Watch the movie, you'll. No, on second thoughts, don't.So, inevetably, they start reading letters from God and want to help the people themselves. Tom totally forgets his character AND his gambling debts and starts acting...you guessed it...completely unbelievable. In one particularly completely unbelievable scene, they save an old man from walking into the ocean on a crowded beach. Ah yes. That's the most efficient way to kill yourself, isn't it. Anyway, they fish him out (he's completely dry), and he gripes a bit, and then that bit goes absolutely nowhere. They build to this moment for 20 minutes, and then it fizzles. Bah.It escalates, as it would do, and it ends with Tom being a bigger man, and we all learned a big lesson about helping others. No, wait. Sorry. It ends with a ludicrous, out-of-place courtroom sequence, where two dogs are interviewed for no reason. It's a roller-coaster. Avoid it like the plague.The short review This movie was boring.

Where is the plot?  These are hard to find because-THERE ARE NONE. and why why why, would the entire town be so afraid of them for 30 plus years, and then magically turn best buds when it come's time to do a spell\/ exorcism? (did any body else feel that way-at times I thought Kidman was trying to be Linda Blair!).  And What on earth is up with the Phone tree????? why would every body have to have a meeting about it?  Does that happen in your home town?  Are people REALLY that rude and narrow minded?  Did that town look suspiciously like the one Sandra was in Hope Floats???  Why did Sandra run towards her future husband and he was running towards her-with out saying one word to each other?  What was the point of her owning the store?  And why were there like 5 workers doing nothing, and no customers?  If you woke up, with some one playing with your face, and found your sister you have not seen in 7+ years, don't you thing you would be the least bid shocked, or happy?  I just don't understand.the characters  what can I say?  NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT HERE.  How can anyone watching this film have any feeling toward a character if they don't bring us one.  Sorry, none worth standing in this flick.  I did not care if Kidman (forgot her name in movie) stayed or went.  I did not care if Bullock feel in love or not.  I did not care if their aunt's came back, if they made margaritas or not (oh yeah-what a stupid scene, espically the direction, terrible.  Acting-non-convincing). CAN  WE SAY PREDICTABLE  everyone knows that Adian Quinn (don't know his name in movie-even used?) is going to have one blue  eye, one green, he can flip pancakes, and has a star.  WOW.  I never saw THAT ONE coming!  (oh, and the whole pancake scene, especially when he flips it up in the air-just cheesy.  I have not seen such bad direction with a camera since the late 80's).  By the way, why could he kill off Kidman's DEAD boyfriend with the star!?!?! Was he a vampire? I really don't mean to rip this apart (well, I guess I do, because I am doing it) but I just don't understand why any of the cast made this. How did it get past viewing audiences?  Why did Kidman take this?  (Sad to say that I expect this from Bullock).  This whole mess is COMPLETELY unlogical, predictable, and just laughable (the last scence practically had me on the ground).

Sorry, none worth standing in this flick.  I did not care if Kidman (forgot her name in movie) stayed or went.  I did not care if Bullock feel in love or not.  I did not care if their aunt's came back, if they made margaritas or not (oh yeah-what a stupid scene, espically the direction, terrible.  Acting-non-convincing).

I never saw THAT ONE coming!  (oh, and the whole pancake scene, especially when he flips it up in the air-just cheesy.  I have not seen such bad direction with a camera since the late 80's).  By the way, why could he kill off Kidman's DEAD boyfriend with the star!?!?! Was he a vampire? I really don't mean to rip this apart (well, I guess I do, because I am doing it) but I just don't understand why any of the cast made this. How did it get past viewing audiences?  Why did Kidman take this?  (Sad to say that I expect this from Bullock).  This whole mess is COMPLETELY unlogical, predictable, and just laughable (the last scence practically had me on the ground).  I can't get over this. 0.5\/10 stars.(the .5 because there was a song from BOOGIE NIGHTS in it-the only enjoyable part of the film).

Given the choice, I have to say that I am a hater. I wouldn't have put it so harshly, but I am led to believe that those were the options.The reason I don't loathe Chris Farley so much after seeing this film is that the movie in itself is to terrible, Chris Farley blends right in and is just as terrible as everything else in this idiotic flick. For fellow Farley-haters, this is something of an achievement.Let me run you through it. A white baby boy is washed up on a secluded coast of Japan, sealed in an water-and-airtight chest. Of course, the baby is in fine shape and not completely asphyxia-blue, as you may have expected. But, as the movie will show us, with Chris Farley around, no natural laws are certain.Anyway, the finders, who are your average ninjas, think this boy to be the Great White Ninja, and train him like that. Of course, the boy grows up to be Chris Farley, which is a very different thing.So we have established a very bad ninja, who falls down a lot, breaks or burns a lot of valuable stuff, and is generally incompetent. So when a beautiful young girl called Allison from Beverly Hills just happens to wander by the ninja's remote secret training grounds, who better to ask for help than Chris Farley, oh sorry, Haru. That's his name in the movie, but I could have sworn he was just Chris Farley in a jumpsuit. To totally convince the girl of his competence he trashes the joint by accident, but this doesn't bother her. In Chris Farley-Land, the mishaps of Chris Farley are invisible.So, Haru finds out quickly that Allison's husband is a counterfeiter and a big-time crook. He finds out about this, because the husband drops little hints like saying 'I am a crook'. In fact, all the characters have the convenient habit of describing themselves and their actions at convenient times. This is the hallmark of fine screenwriting. But I digress.Haru decides to try and find Allison in Beverly Hills. He takes a plane and sets off the metal detector. He courteously removes all his metal weapons, including two huge swords. Do the security guards cuff him immediately for trying to compromise airline security? Nope. Do they take the weapons from him? Nope, he still has the swords in the next scene, in America! What they do is just look at each other, probably thinking why are we in this stupid movie?In America, Haru gets in a car. He makes it obvious in his own, subtle little Farleyesque way that he has never seen a car before. Then he proceeds to drive away in it. 10 IQ points to anyone who can spot the error here.Another 10 IQ points is awarded to the person who can see, that Haru speaking american in a Hollywood accent from the very first scene is a little odd for a kid raised in Japan by ninjas, who at least speak american with appropriate comedy japanese accents.Tally up 10 IQ points for each of these you can see- Chris Rock plays a character, who works in a swanky, 5-star hotel, yet lives in the grubbiest ghetto you can imagine.- The real ninja, Gobei, knows what Allison looks like, despite never having seen her before.- Paying customers to an all-girl strip joint cheer and clap, when Haru blunders onto the catwalk and begins to take all his clothes off (as part of his 'walk-in-the-shadows' strategy)- Haru's reaction to placing his nose on an incredibly hot frying surface in a restaurant is to keep his nose on the surface, smoking and sizzling away, while saying 'aaahh-wooooo-aaaaah'. In a related incident, a boiling hot greasy shrimp is flicked straight from the cooking surface in between a young girl's breasts. Her reaction to the immense pain of a grease-burn on sensitive skin is saying 'ooh' coyly.- The cover operation of the bank note counterfieting business is called 'Beverly Hills Bank Note'- After Haru exposes the entire racket and knows all the crooks' secrets, they capture him. Once he escapes, the bag guys find out, but they don't care that he's gone free.- Horses overtake a sports car, presumably going as fast as it can.If you have 90 IQ points, then, well, you have more points than the producers of this stink-bomb of a movie. Everyone and everything is stupid. The characters are flat and pointless, and so is the abundant, obligatory Farley slapstick.I know it's supposed to be a silly movie, but the writing is just so terrible it could be on Mystery Science Theater. There are good zany comedies out there, a few of the Zuckerman movies spring to mind. They have stupid situations too, but they are on some plane believable.Oh, sorry I said 'plane'. The Collective Consciousness Plane in this movie takes the cake for being the stupidest sequences in the movie. Well, it would have taken the cake, had Chris Farley not eaten it.

Let me explain.A film like this cost about 8 million dollars and in North American receipts, it took in about 17 million dollars.  Now in order for a film to break even, it has to make twice as much as its budget, therefore, the film did make money.  You see, no matter how bad the script is, no matter how little star power there is in the film and no matter how poor an effort is put forth in all facets of the project, there will always be a market for this type of film.  Teens have lots of disposable income and they don't seem to mind spending it on garbage like this.  But analyse it just a little closer and you will realize that while it may be a moderate success, it has no idea how to be an American Pie or Road Trip of today or a Fast Times or Animal House of the past.  Those films are well done and make money for a reason, well many reasons really, but one can be that first of all they are funny and entertaining.  This is one element of Drive Me Crazy that happened to bypass the writers, producers, director and stars.  This is not a funny film and it is not at all enjoyable.  And it truly makes me sick when I read reviews by kids that say how well the film was put together or how it was  pretty cool.

I could go on and on and name a few from the 70's, many from the 80's and even a couple from the 90's.  But it doesn't matter because if a film like this can make money, then they will keep producing garbage like it.

There is no imagination, no ingenuity, no originality and nothing in here is not borrowed from every other teen film out there.  It isn't even important to go into details as to what is wrong with this film because that would just be a waste of time.  Everything is wrong with this film.  The only good thing is Ali Larter.  She is practically unrecognizable in this film but she is good.  That's about it.  All characters are one dimensional, the script is as surprising as a Scooby Doo episode and the actors are about as interesting as studying fungus on a paramesium, it is just bland.Drive Me Crazy is a bad film and not only that but it will inspire more bad films.  We do get lucky every once in a while and get good films released but more often than not we get stuck with waste like this.  If anyone has seen Jaws ( 1975 ) and then watched Jaws IV The Revenge, they can compare what Drive Me Crazy is like to a film like Fast Times and American Pie or even Porky's.

There is no imagination, no ingenuity, no originality and nothing in here is not borrowed from every other teen film out there.  It isn't even important to go into details as to what is wrong with this film because that would just be a waste of time.  Everything is wrong with this film.  The only good thing is Ali Larter.  She is practically unrecognizable in this film but she is good.  That's about it.  All characters are one dimensional, the script is as surprising as a Scooby Doo episode and the actors are about as interesting as studying fungus on a paramesium, it is just bland.Drive Me Crazy is a bad film and not only that but it will inspire more bad films.  We do get lucky every once in a while and get good films released but more often than not we get stuck with waste like this.  If anyone has seen Jaws ( 1975 ) and then watched Jaws IV The Revenge, they can compare what Drive Me Crazy is like to a film like Fast Times and American Pie or even Porky's.  This is about as low as you can get in film making.  1 out of 10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"22 May 2000","score":"","review":"  Maybe I would have enjoyed this film more if not for the media circus that surrounded it.

The premise itself was original at first, but after Cusack, Diaz and Keener kept landing on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike over and over again it got pretty silly. Cusack and especially Diaz (surprise!) played their roles well.  Keener has been good in other pictures but she basically played a one note character here and didn't impress me much.  The various gimmicks, such as the 7 1\/2 floor, the portal, the really dumb gag with Mary Kay Place mishearing everyone, were really nothing to rate this as some kind of film masterpiece. John Malkovich was self-deprecating and he really lifted this picture when he arrived on the scene.  His unintended conversion to a new profession and the way it was presented was the best part of the movie.  It was a case though, of the writer and director trying to be way too clever and the enduring value of this movie will not last very long.

Second, when watching this movie, I was surprised at how the characters always managed to find hidden power sources, secret stashes of explosives and magic fuel to power fighter jets. The funniest directing mistake had to be when the number of fingers on Terl's hand kept changing. Sometimes he had five, sometimes he had six! Then I was amazed at the complete lack of continuity in the film. Scenes randomly happened, and there was no connection to what just happened three seconds ago. Plus, the whole scene with the gold bars bothered me beyond belief. I felt no emotions for any of the characters and I couldn't believe how long two hours could get. I would have to disagree with one comment made about the movie- I do not believe this will end John Travolta's career. He is extremely talented and every great actor has made a rotten movie at least once. Please, please skip this movie and just read the book.

It is the story of two fallen angels, Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon) that have been cast out of heaven and banished to live in Wisconsin.  With the help of their friend, the devil Azrael (Jason Lee), they discover a loophole that allows them plenary absolution during a ceremony at a Church in New Jersey.  If they enter this church, they will be forgiven and be able to get back into heaven.  The trouble is that if they do this, God will be proven fallible and existence will come to an end.  So Metatron (Alan Rickman) recruits Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) who is the last scion of Christ to help stop them from entering the church.  The rest of the story is basically an action adventure\/comedy sendup culminating in a confrontation on the church steps.Kevin Smith's story starts out razor sharp, with biting intellectual humor that mocks some of the basic tenets of religious belief, while simultaneously broaching some pretty deep philosophical questions.  Unfortunately, as the film progresses, the edge is lost and it degenerates into a slapstick action flick with occasional returns to the religious allusions.  Overall, it was very entertaining, but the story could have been so much more if it stayed on point with wry intellectual forays, rather than degenerating into farce.The cast was delightful.  Matt Damon gets a chance to play a little less serious role and brings an enchanting comic naivete to Loki, the former angel of death and vengeance.  Affleck is the most intellectual and serious of the characters, and it is his ability to stay sincerely serious in absurd situations that makes him so funny.  Linda Fiorentino was terrific as the Catholic girl who had lost her faith.  She had a wonderful ability to broach disturbing thoughts that almost all of us have about God and religion, while maintaining a sense of mocking self doubt and comical despair. Chris Rock plays the spiritual guide; the unheralded 13th apostle of Christ.  He brings his usual ironic style and hilarious assortment of facial reactions and steals more than half the laughs in the film.  And then there were Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes, once again reprising their roles and Silent Bob and Jay (a trademark of Kevin Smith films, he finds a way to insert these two characters into almost every movie he does).  There were also bit parts for Salma Hayek, George Carlin and Alanis Morissette (as God).This is a entertaining film that missed its chance to be a classic religious parody by losing its soul and going off the deep end.  Still, if you have the ability to have a sense of humor about God, there is a lot of good comedy here.  I gave it a 7\/10.  Religious zealots steer clear.  This movie will either offend you or shake your faith.
