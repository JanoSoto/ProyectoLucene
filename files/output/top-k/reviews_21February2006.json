The Godmother? No -- hardly that.This is the most complex of the few movies I've seen that deal with the reign of Elizabeth I. John Ford's Mary of Scotland was really about Mary and its message was simple-minded the Catholics were good and the Calvinists bad. In The Sea Hawk, we learned that it was an almighty good thing for Flora Robson to have Errol Flynn on her side. Vanessa Redgrave, in Mary, Queen of Scots, taught us that the queen who leads with her head and not with her heart wins.Elizabeth doesn't have such an easily stated message. It's an expensive costume romantic drama that has dozens of characters and at least twice that many intrigues.As for the religious part of the conflict, the Catholics come off the worst, although the Protestants don't exactly shine either. A priest comes from France, murders people, and tries more than once to assassinate Elizabeth -- once by poisoning her dress. (How do you do that?) And it's amazing, really, how many of the people Elizabeth has known all her life turn out to be secret Catholic traitors, hiding in holes and whatnot. The headsman is kept busy and the climax contrasts the executions and the lopped-off heads with the ritual purity of Elizabeth's coronation, again vide The Godfather. Thinking it over, I'm not sure there is a moral behind this epic at all. Maybe, like The Godfather, it is meant to show us that it's powerful lonely at the top. It also twigs us to the fact that when Elizabeth is referred to as a virgin queen, the term is used figuratively. I think, if I had been her counselor, I'd have had the answer to all the religious troubles and the competition with France, Scotland, and Spain and all that dreary stuff.I'd have made sure she married the incestuous, foolish Duc d'Anjou. Okay, he was a cross-dressing pouf, but so what? Elizabeth already spoke French, so the language wouldn't have been a problem. The Duc could have handled the money, and he would know where the best restaurants were hidden. And besides, in addition to getting an amusing sometime-lover, she would have had access to a region that cultivates fine pears and produces a respectable rosé.Pshaw, you say. The marriage wouldn't have worked out. I reply how many marriages do you know that DO work out? And there is always divorce, isn't there? After all, Elizabeth's Old Man invented it. Oh -- and another thing. If we're all going to conspire against one another and go about chopping off heads because of religious differences, let's get rid of religions. We could all become serious Pantheists. That would satisfy everybody, from the rabid Evangelicals to the Green Party.Some advice After watching this movie, for a good tickle, go to some of the news boards and read all the venomous comments about how the Moslems keep fighting each other.But, all seriousness aside, the movie's worth seeing. The locations and production design are splendid. The music opulent. The acting just fine on everyone's part, including John Gielgud in a tiny unsympathetic role as the Pope. Cate Blanchett is luminously beautiful but not in a typical Hollywood way. She has a pale elongated face and an anole's eyes that are expressive slits. At its best, the film is an elaborate panorama and at it's least, an amuse-bouche.

I also liked AOTC a lot,none of the movies disappointed me. So now,I will get to what I thought about the Phantom Menace Firstly,I thought that all the performances of the main cast were especially good.I liked Natalie Portman as (Queen Padme Amidala)and I also liked Pernilla August as (Shme Skywalker,Anakin's Mother).I also want to comment on Liam Neeson's role as Qui-Gon Jinn he was very good as Obi-Wan's Jedi Master,I also liked Ewan McGregor's portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi,Qui-Gon Jinn's young headstrong Jedi apprentice,however he really didn't have that much to do in TPM but when he did it was big.Ewan McGregors role in the next two movies was a lot larger. He had a lot more to do and say,his action scenes were outstanding!!I also thought that the Supporting cast did very well.I liked the artistry of the planets such as Tatoonie,Naboo and Corusant. I really liked the underwater city that is on Naboo.On Naboo the character of Jar Jar Binks is introduced,I thought that he was funny and I don't understand why people hated him so much.Well they didn't have to worry about it because he wasn't really on the screen that much in AOTC&ROTS.You also see the creation of C-Threepio by a young Anakin played by newcomer Jake Lloyd.You also get to see how C-Threepio and R2-D2 got together. You also get to see Anakin the pilot start to emerge in this movie.The movie shows what it was like before the empire was formed and also how Senator Palpatine(Darth Sidious,Emperor)Ian McDiarmid came to power and also what kind of people Luke and Leia's parents were.(Padme and Anakin) Ian McDiarmid played the role of the evil emperor(Senator Palpatine)flawlessly.It is the introduction of the Republic,The JediThe Sith and other characters that will make up the Star Wars universe and it also introduces the Trade Federation.I just want to make a quick comment on the young actor that they got to play Anakin.Jake Lloyd was very good as Anakin Skywalker.After all(Darth Vader)had to start off as an innocent child like anyone else.I don't know why everyone was so critical of the actor,I mean give me a break he is a kid after all,give him a chance I am sure that as he gets older he will get better as an actor.I liked when it was time for Young Anakin to leave Tatoonie it really was bittersweet.He is upset that he is leaving his mother but he tells her that he will be back for her.However,as you will see when he does finally go back for her it is already to late.I thought those scenes were very powerful.You will see his anger start to emerge at what has happened to his mother but that scene is in the next movie(AOTC).You will see his anger and his conflicting emotions come to a head in the last movie(ROTS).You also see a little bit of the dark side start to emerge in Anakin in (AOTC).Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn meets the young Anakin Skywalker and he feels that he is destined for great things.I also liked the pod-race scenes,it was exciting and the effects were great.The special effects in this movie were very good and they are even better in the next two movies.The Phantom Menace is also the beginning of the love story between Anakin and Padme.It develops in to something really big in AOTC.The costumes in all of the movies were fantastic.Trisha Biggar is a great costume designer.The music in all of the Star Wars movies is great.John William's is a fantastic composer.George Lucas really did really well by getting him to do the musical scores for all of his movies.I liked the music in all of the movies especially the Duel of Fates and Anakin's theme,I also liked Anakin and Padme's love theme in the second movie it was beautiful. I also liked the revised version ofDuel of Fate which became the newer version theBattle of the Heroesin Revenge of the Sith,the climatic light saber duel between Anakin And Obi-Wan.The light saber duel between Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul was great, then you had the duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Maul which were both outstanding.I also feel that Darth Maul was the ultimate Sith Lord next to the Emperor and of course Darth Vader.Darth Maul really should have been on the screen more then he was.I was rooting for the Jedi to win every time of course.Finally,I think George Lucas did really well for this movie and he is under-appreciated.When are the critics going to wake up and give this Director,Producer the recognition that he so richly deserves.Good start for the lead in movie to the next two movies.Keep up the good work,George.THE FORCE IS INDEED VERY STRONG WITH THIS SERIES.I love all the movies,I will never get tired of watching them.

I'm sure you've read that already, on the back of the Criterion DVD box, on the synopsis written for it at any site where it's listed, in the many reviews, both critical and mundane, and everywhere that even mentions this movie.So I'm not going to go so much into the focus of the characters on Death, as it were, because you know it all already, even if you haven't seen it. Instead what I'll focus on is the idea of presenting Death or, roughly, imaging him. One of the key things that sets the events in this movie off is that the knight asks Death to play chess and, when Death asks him how he knows he likes chess, the knight answers, I saw it in a painting. Throughout this movie are shown many different artists, philosophers, and people trying to present what Death is and looks like via different media such as painting, theatre, prayer, actions, and discussions, and yet the main memorable image of this film is precisely the distinctive image of Death himself, the man with the thin lips and large forhead who holds his arm out to envelop on the front cover of the Criterion DVD. A film that invests its interest in Death needs a way of presenting him in a way that isn't completely stuck in the inspirations of other presentations, else focusing an entire work on Death becomes merely repetitious to what has all been said before. Thus we have a very original and thus very compelling image of Death that becomes the inspiration instead of just being an amalgamation of other's ideas.Thus this movie brilliantly shows Death personified and characterized without holding all the dialog towards Death as a person but Death as a force. By showing that other people draw Death in various forms and different symbolic ways, the subjective viewpoint of who Death is is reinforced without having to be stated, which can be condescending.Then we are so pleasantly allowed to sit back and watch the other characters all invest their energy into their ideas of Death, to mix them together and come up with a complete idea of how Death affects us profoundly and psychologically.--PolarisDiB ","genre":null},{"date":"21 February 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one of those movies, like Seven Samurai, where you watch it for the first time, following one character, and suddenly not-quite-midway through you realize that every character is important and intricately linked into the progression and exposition of the story and themes, so you know before you've even finished that you need to watch it again.One of the more blatantly philosophical films out there (which is a good thing in this case, by the way, don't think that I'm using the term blatant as a negative indicator), Ingred Bergman's The Seventh Seal basically is a contemplation on Death.

I actually am not a huge player of combat games all together, more of an occasional player. I do, how ever, like brainless action.

Sure, there hardly is character development in any of the genre films, but that wasn't my beef. It's the fact, that effects are poorly made, settings are bad and even the actors are more bad than usual.Actually Street Fighter looks like very typical late 80's small budget action film. Only problem is, that it was made mid 90's and it had a budget over 30 millions. With that money more capable director would have made very enjoyable action flick, but of that there are no worries in the Street Fighter.Jean-Claude Van Damme gives out a even bit more worse display of his actinic skills than usual. But then again not even Raul Julia can save this ship from sinking.Recommendation Not even for the more die hard Damme fans. Expect this film become a campy humor classic during 10 or more years, tough something tells me it already is.

MAYBE not. But if you think this as a comedy, as I did, and remember the former parts, it's actually funny, at least to some point. It is a light parody of the Death Wish movies. As an independent movie, apart from those, it's nothing. It doesn't even have a script.I'm sure the director has thought of this as a joke. For example there is an educational scene about drugs One guy has died after a drug pipe exploded on his face! And the corpses in the mortuary move their eyes quite visibly!

This is the kind of movie that you can make food, go to toilet, or talk in the telephone during watching, and don't have to press pause. Actually you don't have to even watch it.
