This is a well-written film with great actors, great casting, great laughs, and a lot of suspense and somehow a priceless film comes out of this.Eddie Valiant is a down and out Private Detective living in Los Angeles. He hates these walking cartoons that surround him.  Valiant is hired however to find out if the wife of famed cartoon Roger Rabbit is having an affair with Marvin Acme.  If I told you anymore I would be giving the plot away. Hoskins does a great job in this role, he really hold the film together.The movie is a live action cartoon.  Every part of this movie is overdone but somehow out of it all these characters are surprisingly believable. Steven Spielberg produced this movie and he has always had a penchant for making these off the wall films that have great acting too.  In fact a good part of the movie is characters and that if why it is so good.  A lot of movies do not have to rely on characters and can make it alone on special effects.  This movie uses them both and the result is close to a spectacle.The story is very good too.  Being the fact this is a cartoon movie and all you would think this might not be given the best writing or development, but just the opposite is true.  The story here is drawn out perfectly and will hold your attention throughout the movie.  Not only will your attention be held to the movie but also this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.This is not really a kid's movie.  There are some suggestive scenes and dialogue (I did not understand the bit about playing Patty Cake at the beginning when I first saw the movie.)  Part of the reason this movie was so wonderful in y estimation is that there are generations that watched cartoons and this is almost the culmination of all of these cartoons and they are all in one movie.SPOILER I loved the ending where all of the cartoon characters got together at the end when I was seven, and I guess I still do like it, there will be few times that all of those cartoon characters are together.  And if you think about it all of those cartoons are some of the most recognizable figures in the world, and they are all together.  It is amazing to me anyway.Christopher Lloyd is an excellent villain.  I have to admit as Judge Doom he has it together.  Lloyd has the look of a truly evil villain, but he has that cartoonish quality about him too.  With that smile, that walk, that facial expression it seems as though Christopher Lloyd was born to play Judge Doom, and he does it to the hilt, he is perfect in the part.  Lloyd has such a presence in this part.  He is just all around wonderful.  But that is not to take away from Hoskins, the two essentially do an equally high quality performance and they are perfect foils.Charles Fleischer does an excellent job as the voice of Roger Rabbit.  He is perfect, and is hysterical.  This is one of the last movies where Tony Anselmo, (Mickey mouse) Wayne Allwine, (Donald Duck) and Mel Blanc (almost every Looney Tune) did the voices of their characters.  This is a landmark picture as well.  This will probably be one of the only times that Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit are in the same movie.  It is amazing.There are a group of character actors that just make this movie so congruent and yes so believable, for a cartoon movie anyway.  They seem like real people.  Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis know what they are doing. With great character actors like Alan Tilvern, (who is British) Paul Springer, and Richard Ridings in small parts make every little detail of this movie that much better.Also two other big names in the movie, Stubby Kaye and Joanna Cassidy do well in their respective parts as well.  My favorite scenes are the showdown in the bar, and the finale. SPOILER  The finale is just unbelievable. With the Weasils, the dancing and the fighting straight out of a Bugs Bunny\/Elmer Fudd cartoon it is near perfect to me.  That to me is one of my favorite scenes in a movie.  It is just great.  The whole movie is great.  The references to Warner Brothers, Walt Disney, and the barrage of cartoon characters you see makes this movie amazing.  The only drawback was that there were no Hanna-Barbara cartoon characters and I wish there were. There was going to be a sequel, but Frank Marshall pulled out on funding, too bad. Still this one is good enough.  I have seen this movie a few times and I will probably watch it a few more.

The reality of it, however, is that we all live in glass houses built on foundations anchored in the shifting sands of happenstance, and a `reality check,' courtesy of the entertainment medium of film is not a thing to be taken lightly, discounted or dismissed out-of-hand.  `The Sum of All Fears,' directed by Phil Alden Robinson, is a cautionary tale that is thought provoking and all too valid, especially in the wake of 9\/11.  As a film, it may have some minor flaws and the story is certainly disconcerting, but in light of recent events in America, as well as around the world, it makes us aware of the importance of being ever vigilant, and it's important in that it reminds us of things that must not be forgotten lest they be repeated, just as a film like `Schindler's List' will forever be a kind of safeguard against another Holocaust.  A single film may on it's own be just another brick in the wall, but if filmmakers persist, eventually that wall will perhaps become a kind of fortress that may help prevent a repetition of the blunders and crimes perpetrated throughout the history of the world.  The screenplay was adapted by Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne from the novel by Tom Clancy; the story is a proposition of what could happen if a nuclear bomb fell into the wrong hands, how the preeminent governments of the world would respond and what the outcome would mean to the average citizen living in the Ukraine or in Podunk, U.S.A.  It's a hypothetical situation that, quite frankly, a few years ago would've been perceived by most as being as close to reality as `The Martian Chronicles.'  But not anymore.  Looking beyond the drama of the story and the way it's presented, the actual events depicted here are almost too close for comfort and will no doubt evoke a sense of denial in many viewers who still refuse to accept the state of the world as it is today.  The film itself is, of course, a big budget, Hollywood production-- which in not a BAD thing-- but as such the drama is a bit stiff and stilted at times, and the presentation by director Robinson lacks originality and imagination; too often we see exactly what we expect (when a member of the Russian cadre, for example, demurs to the cold reality of their plan and announces his withdrawal, we know that he's signed his own death warrant.  Seeing him garroted by the silent, hulking henchman before he reaches the door is anticlimactic; it would have been entirely more effective had Robinson taken a page from David Lean's Book and left it up to the viewer's imagination).  But the performances are to the last actor solid and convincing, and late in the film the story takes a decidedly unexpected turn that allows for a suspenseful climax; after a point you can speculate as to the final outcome, but you cannot know absolutely until the very end.  As Confucius (or was it Yogi?) once said, It ain't over till it's over.The real strength of the film, though, lies in the very honest depiction of the events and the way they play out, from the unimaginable success of the terrorists to the confusion, uncertainty and irresolution of those in power.  Initially, the ease with which much of what happens is seemingly effected may evoke a reaction of disbelief and incredulity; but in retrospect, in reality this is more than likely exactly the way such things would happen.  But we're conditioned by not only by what we've seen in other movies (James Bond ALWAYS saves the day, doesn't he?), but by what society tells us is so and by what we WANT to believe.  Al-Qaida, however, is real; 9\/11 is real.  It's just not something we want to acknowledge, just as we do not want to believe that a handful of people control the destiny of the entire world, including a leader like this film's President Fowler (James Cromwell), who excels at waving to fans at a football game, talking tough and telling the people what they want to hear, but just may be clueless, ineffective and governed by personal agenda behind closed doors.  Which is precisely what this film points out in terms that are at once subtle and overt.As Jack Ryan, Ben Affleck gives an acceptable performance, and though he's convincing he lacks the intensity of his predecessor in the role, Harrison Ford, or even that of Alec Baldwin, who first created the character in 1990's `The Hunt for Red October.'  Buy this is a younger Jack Ryan, new to the C.I.A. and not yet married, which may provoke some confusion in fans of this series, as on one hand this story predates `October,' and yet the events seem to reflect more recent incidents, subsequent to all that happened in the first three `Ryan' films.  But taken as a separate entity, this film is contextually intact and stands on it's own; just be prepared to view it as an independent entry in the series with a value that supersedes any sequential necessity.The most notable performances are turned in by Morgan Freeman (Cabot) Liev Schreiber (Clark), Philip Baker Hall (Defense Secretary Becker) and Ron Rifkin (Owens).This is the kind of film that many viewers will subconsciously attempt to distance themselves from emotionally, and will take great delight in concentrating on minor technical flaws as it will enable them to sleep a little easier at night.  But in the final analysis, `The Sum of All Fears' says something about who we are, `where' we are and the state of the world in which we live today; things we would probably rather not contemplate, but nevertheless, must.

I guess I just can't seem to place what this film has that other films of the same nature don't have.  But, like I said, don't get me wrong, I thought this was an excellent film.Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins were fantastic in their respect roles and really had some great chemistry between their characters.  The supporting cast members, Anthony Heald, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, and Frankie Faison were very good as well.  Also, the directing of Jonathan Demme was excellent.I thought the story was quite interesting and very well done.  The film is rarely boring and keeps a good pace throughout the film.

I thought Dawn of the Dead, Re-Animator or the Evil Dead films were the goriest movies prior to seeing this.  Boy was I wrong!Words cannot describe the violence contained in this movie.  It's directed by Peter Jackson, yes, the same guy who directed Lord of the Rings, and for an early 90's New Zealand filmed movie, this one sets the standard for gore in films.  It's as if Peter Jackson wanted to make a movie that far surpasses any gore-fest by 1000%.  What do I mean by gore?  I'm talking more than the simple decapitation or zombies munching on human remains...oh, it has that too, but add a severed head being diced in a blender, a human spine with intestines squirming that stalks and tries to choke the main character for the last 30 minutes of the film, a guy's face being ripped off of his head, a zombie thrusting its hand through the back of a screaming lady's head and then choking another victim with the same hand sprawling out of her mouth, a guy's entire chest (ribs and all) being ripped out of his body while he is screaming, DOZENS of corpses meeting untimely ends via a lawnmower and of course, the most disgusting pudding eating scene ever filmed.  Plus dozens of other shocking scenes and almost literally waterfalls full of gore splattering around the place.Okay, for such an over the top movie, and me being a horror buff I have to be completely honest on this one.  I am so surprised to say this, but it is really entertaining.  There are scenes that will totally gross you out, but Peter Jackson films everything as a black comedy.  Almost every 'gross out' scene is played for dark humor, which is very effective.  If you can take it, you'll be literally laughing out loud at the extreme violence and obsurdity of this one, not necessarily b\\c it's funny in a natural sense, but b\\c it is so obsurd.  There is basically no plot in this one, a man's mother gets bitten by this foreign rat-monkey thing and then she turns into a zombie.  Soon, she starts turning others into zombies as well, and then when about 50 swingers come to party at their mansion (the place where the main character keeps the growing number of zombie bodies, away from others) all freaking hell breaks loose.  I'm talking like 30 minutes of PURE GORE. I know this one will please gore fanatics, especially b\\c it is underrated and not as well known as the Evil Dead films.  If gore is your thing, DEFINITELY check this one out, however, a word of caution, this movie is so gory, that if you can't see the humor (and Peter Jackson amazingly provides humor in every single gore scene, and there are dozens of them) in the gore scenes, which are very bloody and rather disturbing then please, do not, I repeat do not rent this movie.  I could see how people with weak stomachs would throw up while watching this movie.  But, for those who like ultra dark comedy and ultra gore, by all means, rent this one.Okay, I've commented a lot on the gore which is ubiquitous in this film. The question remains, did I like it?  Honestly, yes I did.  And I'll tell you why.  First of all, the main love interest with the two main characters is very cute and I was rooting for them to end up together the entire time. Second, I have to be honest, the movie was directed very well and incredibly stylish.  I saw a lot of similarities in direction from this and LOTR. Okay, onto the gore.  Me, I like gore in films if it's played for CAMP, not SHOCK or GROSS OUT.  This one was played for all three, and there were times I was exclaiming profanities in response to the scenes I had just witnessed, but I must say, I did have fun watching this one.  However, I can take the gore, though I know most people could not.  I saw the unrated version of Dead Alive, though apparently there is a way toned down R-rated version out there too that I haven't seen.  But anyway, if you can stomach it, this is without a doubt the most unique and underrated 'horror' film I've ever seen (it's not really a horror film b\\c it is not that scary).  I have to give props to any director who directs an indie flick and goes to the extreme to create his vision WHILE doing a stylish and superb job at the task he was trying to accomplish.  That is why I love B-movies, it is b\\c there are no rules, the director does what he wants and we get movies that are over-the-top, or anti-Hollywood.  This one is as over-the-top as you can get, and that is saying a lot!!!I have to give this one 9\/10 stars b\\c it was very entertaining even though it was incredibly gory and at times made me have to think about running to the bathroom.  The director had a vision, and he more than accomplished it, which is rare in these days.  I'm glad I saw it, so I could make it a milestone over the other horror movies I thought to be too gory (haha, those films have nothing on this one!!), but will I ever see it again?  Probably not.

He (whatever faults he has as an actor) is multi-talented. He writes\/produces\/directs\/composes and coreographs most of his movies. He is well versed in many languages, and was the first white guy to open a dojo in japan. He also has a shadowy past with the CIA, and has been bodyguard to several heads of state....oh, and did i mention he was an aikido master? Since making his debut in 88's ABOVE THE LAW, SEAGAL was very popular. His career went into hyper-space with 92's UNDER SIEGE (not my favourite SEAGAL movie, by the way!) and with this clout, he had the power to direct his next movie ON DEADLY GROUND. It all went wrong with this movie...he injected (some might say, not me!) a preachy overtone concerning the enviroment. The movie flopped Although not a bad movie (it gets the same negative reviews as WILLIAM SHATNER'S star trek v) his next couple of movies had too much spirituality and not enough fighting.

I doubt the Salkinds (producers) really had as brilliant a vision for 'Superman the Movie' and took it more than anything as an opportunity to make themselves some guaranteed money out of what had become a comic book hero, I'm sure of that.  The fact that several re-writes were done to make the script into something more credible, less laughable and more what Donner envisioned this film could be justifies this. The film could have been very camp and most definitely hard to believe in.  for a start nobody had ever flown on screen in a credible fashion and from the start you're lumbered with that rather amusing Superman outfit you just had to believe in, or else.  There were many traps to fall into.   They could have got a huge superstar to play the part of Superman but that was just one of the traps Donner avoided.  the unknown they found, one Christopher Reeve is absolutely believable, loveable and brilliant in this dual role of the charming, confident and courageous Kal-El\/Superman and his disguise as the nervy, shy Clark Kent.  Maybe its unfair to say that he was born to play the role but you really get that impression.  He is totally believable and his unknown quality attributed to the fact that there really was no doubt in your mind, this WAS indeed Superman. The plot for the first hour or so really does and has to move at the speed of light, covering Superman's first thirty years, from the explosion of his home planet, to his growing up on Earth and his transformation into Superman.  And this is a little uncomfortable as a viewer, though it was probably paced as well as it could have been.   This leads to the real highlight of the movie which is the mid-section where Clark arrives in Metropolis and we discover Lex Luthor, Lois Lane and Superman making his first dramatic public appearances.  The direction, scripting and acting in these 30 minutes or so is delightful and really gets you drawn into this fantastical plot.  Luthor is played brilliantly by Gene Hackman and with his assistant Otis it is a villainous double act as good and enjoyable to watch as anyone could have imagined. The only real disappointment must be that the finale of the film is a slight let down by the rest of the film's high standards.  It is a almost too big a challenge - Superman chasing 2 Nuclear missiles and dealing with the mayhem that ensues.  It did feel like it was a slight anti-climax. But on the other hand the idea of killing Lois and then having Superman turn back the world to save her I thought was surprising and exciting But the most brilliant aspect of this movie is undoubtedly the wonderful John William's score.  To my mind he wrote the greatest piece of theme music to a film ever with this film.  The opening credits go on so long it almost feels as if they have done it just to give us more of the amazing Superman theme.  In this, he created a piece of music even grander than the entire Superman character and myth itself.

Only the unimaginative or uptight or those with no sense of humour or humanity would not enjoy this film.  and even thought it has indeed dated (the effects are not quite so believable anymore) it is a true classic of its time and a truly fun adventure. there really aren't enough films like this made anymore. 8\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"16 November 2002","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I think the real success of this film could be attributed equally as to what Richard Donner and the team of writers didn't do as much as what they did do in the finished product.

So here I go again.Jurassic Park was most definitely one of the greatest movies ever made.  It combined the enthralling special effects of Steven Spielberg, the creative genius of Stan Winston, the writing of the talented Michael Crichton, and the excellent themes of John Williams.  In other words, it was very near perfection.The Lost World was a flop.  And Jurassic Park III is obviously an attempt to get the series back into gear.When I first started watching the movie, I didn't feel the same excitement that the first one brought.  Quite possibly because of the new director.  Or maybe Don Davis' disgusting themes.  Or perhaps it was just because it tried to hard to look like the first one.  But somehow I felt that Jurassic Park III was separated from the other two, that Alan Grant was totally different.  We didn't even get to see Mr. Hammond.The special effects aren't as great as its predecessors.  The T-Rex is barely believable; something just looks wrong with it.  The spinosaurus is nothing compared to the sheer magnificence of the T-Rex in the first movie.  It just doesn't have the power to drop your jaw, most likely because it has a lame entrance and is not much different from the T-Rex anyway.The actors do really well, I think.  Sam Neill remains one of my favorites, and Alan Grant has also been a favorite character of mine for a long time.The concept of going back to Isla Sorna and finding something new (the spinosaurus) is kind of weird.  It doesn't even seem like the same island as it was on The Lost World.  The compound is not the same, and the raptors look different.  One thing I do like, however, is that this movie is a little brighter.  In The Lost World, it was almost always night, making it a very dark movie.  This one wasn't so nasty.  But the first one had the perfect balance, combining both day and night.  This one is too bright.The plot is obviously not one of Crichton's.  Unfortunately, this movie is not based on one of his books.  However, that may be a good thing, considering how badly The Lost World was ripped apart in the conversion from writing to screen.  But it's easily discerned as not Crichton's work.Don Davis' music is simply awful.  He attempts to re-use the main themes in the exact same spots they were used in Jurassic Park, which didn't fly well with me.  They needed John Williams in there.  I have never liked Don Davis since his performance in the Matrix, and he certainly didn't do well here.

But since then, the more successful it's gotten, the more I've grown to loathe it.  $200 million+!  Come on, no Julia Roberts movie has ever even made that much!  And I'm sure fans of this movie will say that it deserves to be more successful, because it is about a real woman.  Well for a movie that's supposed to speak to real people, this sure comes across as a silly banal fantasy.  I have to say that it's missing that special ingredient present in the best romantic comedies-romance.Help me out here, what exactly is so great about Toula?  That she works at a travel agency?  That she knows how to use a computer?  That she eats white bread sandwiches?  That she's confident?  Woe is me, if only I could find such a remarkable woman.  Many films are insulting to the audiences' intelligence in that they take a beautiful woman, change her hair and give her glasses, and claim she's ugly.  This movie is just as bad in a different way.  Nia Vardalos does make herself look quite gross at the beginning of the movie.  And after getting the contacs and perm, she's not ugly anymore.  However, she is certainly no Miss Universe and the film's expecting us to believe that John Corbett would take one look at her and instantly be infatuated is ridiculous.  I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder but here the attraction was based purely on outer beauty at first. And let's talk about inner beauty-when do we see that?  Toula seems reasonably nice, but nothing like Gwenyth Paltrow's character in Shallow Hal.  And she's not charming either.  I had a film class TA at school once who liked kinda like Toula, but I thought she was very attractive because of her lovely personality.  I think the only time Toula even shows a hint of personality is when she jokes with Ian about the old lady ass kicking.I found no memorable dialogue or chemistry whatsoever between the leads in this movie (I don't care how Julia Roberts looks, Notting Hill had those in spades) and the whole story line, what there was of one, was dumb.  OK so he sees her once after she's made over, and from then on out he kisses the ground she walks on, doing everything he can to make her happy without even asking for anything in return other than her love (Oh Ian, you came and you gave without taking...bleh).  I'm guessing the reason this movie has been such a colossal hit is because it appeals to the fantasies of all the unattractive middle aged women out there who daydream that if they got a makeover they could have a perfect man idolizing them instead of being stuck with their fat bald husbands who always forget their anniversaries and birthdays.Now maybe I'm kind of missing the point, and the most important thing about this movie is not the romance but the comedy.  Well okay, I thought that was decent.  I laughed at the Windex, and there were other lines and moments which I thought were clever.  But it's nothing special.  The whole movie was basically a sophomoric sitcom (maybe that's a reduntant phrase) with one dimensional stereotypcial characters and contrived silly situations.Not that that can't be entertaining.  I'll reiterate that I liked the movie in the theater.  My comments have been so negative just because I'm so sick of all the attention and praise it's getting.  I'd say that this movie is worth maybe a DVD rental, or better yet just watching on tv if you have nothing better do.  I agree with the person on the message board who said that, given all the challenging, mesmerizing independent fare out there, it's upsetting filmgoers have made My Big Fat Greek Wedding the most successful independent movie of all time by a huge margin.  I think in a fairer world, where effort and talent proportionately yielded box office, this movie would have made the one making $24 million (still a huge profit off of a $3 million budget) and Memento and Christopher Nolan would be reaping the benefits of a $200 million gross.

And I'm sure fans of this movie will say that it deserves to be more successful, because it is about a real woman.  Well for a movie that's supposed to speak to real people, this sure comes across as a silly banal fantasy.  I have to say that it's missing that special ingredient present in the best romantic comedies-romance.Help me out here, what exactly is so great about Toula?  That she works at a travel agency?  That she knows how to use a computer?  That she eats white bread sandwiches?  That she's confident?  Woe is me, if only I could find such a remarkable woman.  Many films are insulting to the audiences' intelligence in that they take a beautiful woman, change her hair and give her glasses, and claim she's ugly.  This movie is just as bad in a different way.  Nia Vardalos does make herself look quite gross at the beginning of the movie.  And after getting the contacs and perm, she's not ugly anymore.  However, she is certainly no Miss Universe and the film's expecting us to believe that John Corbett would take one look at her and instantly be infatuated is ridiculous.  I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder but here the attraction was based purely on outer beauty at first. And let's talk about inner beauty-when do we see that?  Toula seems reasonably nice, but nothing like Gwenyth Paltrow's character in Shallow Hal.  And she's not charming either.  I had a film class TA at school once who liked kinda like Toula, but I thought she was very attractive because of her lovely personality.  I think the only time Toula even shows a hint of personality is when she jokes with Ian about the old lady ass kicking.I found no memorable dialogue or chemistry whatsoever between the leads in this movie (I don't care how Julia Roberts looks, Notting Hill had those in spades) and the whole story line, what there was of one, was dumb.  OK so he sees her once after she's made over, and from then on out he kisses the ground she walks on, doing everything he can to make her happy without even asking for anything in return other than her love (Oh Ian, you came and you gave without taking...bleh).  I'm guessing the reason this movie has been such a colossal hit is because it appeals to the fantasies of all the unattractive middle aged women out there who daydream that if they got a makeover they could have a perfect man idolizing them instead of being stuck with their fat bald husbands who always forget their anniversaries and birthdays.Now maybe I'm kind of missing the point, and the most important thing about this movie is not the romance but the comedy.  Well okay, I thought that was decent.  I laughed at the Windex, and there were other lines and moments which I thought were clever.  But it's nothing special.  The whole movie was basically a sophomoric sitcom (maybe that's a reduntant phrase) with one dimensional stereotypcial characters and contrived silly situations.Not that that can't be entertaining.  I'll reiterate that I liked the movie in the theater.  My comments have been so negative just because I'm so sick of all the attention and praise it's getting.  I'd say that this movie is worth maybe a DVD rental, or better yet just watching on tv if you have nothing better do.  I agree with the person on the message board who said that, given all the challenging, mesmerizing independent fare out there, it's upsetting filmgoers have made My Big Fat Greek Wedding the most successful independent movie of all time by a huge margin.  I think in a fairer world, where effort and talent proportionately yielded box office, this movie would have made the one making $24 million (still a huge profit off of a $3 million budget) and Memento and Christopher Nolan would be reaping the benefits of a $200 million gross.
