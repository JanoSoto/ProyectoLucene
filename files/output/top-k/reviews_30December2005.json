Most of them are made with certain goals. Some aim at sheer entertainment; some at conveying morals; some are made in educational purposes; some are vehicles for stars; yet some of them attempt to spread art. There are, however, films that serve most of these goals. An example of the film which combines all prestigious aspects of cinema is, without any doubt, THE LAST LAUGH (1924) by a master F.W. Murnau. It is a film that a lot of people consider one of the most artistic films ever made. Although its content may seem sad and its silent form dated, there are very few people who do not find this movie worth seeing. Here, it seems significant to state that it is one of the few silents that have been watched and admired not only by silent movie fans but foremost by people who are not knowledgeable of silent cinema and who are not keen on it whatsoever. Is there some magical spell that Murnau and his cast put into this film more than 80 years ago that it does not seem to fade? Here are some of the factors that make the film highly recommended.First of all, THE LAST LAUGH is the film which could boast the very innovative movement of the camera, a great invention of Murnau and cameraman Karl Freund. It does not only move leftwards and rightwards but also forward and backwards. The best example is the famous final shot of the main character (Emil Jannings) leaving the hotel in which he has had such extreme experiences. As he gives money to the people in the row waving him goodbye, the camera beautifully moves together with the movement of Jannings. This was really something extraordinary for the 1920s, people were particularly astonished by the camera possibilities and the film was a smashing success. Therefore, even now, thanks to this aspect, the film does not seem as dated as other films from the early 1920s (we must keep in mind that this was 1924 and silents were less developed than the later ones with Garbo, for instance). Secondly, the film differs from most other silents in another aspect. While many films from 1910s and 1920s had subtitles as to what is being said by particular characters, THE LAST LAUGH does not have them. Everything is so beautifully conveyed by the players that it seems to be absolutely unnecessary to have it written what they say. Jannings gives a marvelous performance as a humiliated man, deprived of everything, even his dignity, who had to replace his honorable position of a luxurious hotel Porter with a guardian of its toilet. It is difficult to express it fully with words but when you look at Jannings, there is such a feeling that you can read his mind. I had this impression throughout the whole movie. Others also play very well but it is Jannings who is in the main role, who is given most time on screen and whose portrayal is the most memorable. I haven't seen THE LAST COMMAND (1928) but it is undeniable that his role in LAST LAUGH was a milestone of his career. Moreover, he is an absolute model of male silent performance.The whole content is also not much dated. The main idea of what happened to the Porter of the Atlantic Hotel is pretty universal. Who knows what the future will bring? Therefore, it was easy to feel empathy with the main character for the 1920s audiences and it is still possible for us. Perhaps, you may consider my opinion exaggerated, but I think that Murnau made his film everlasting partly thanks to this very content. How can a viewer skip the empathy with the poor old man when he reads a letter that fires him or when the gossip spreads to his district? The dreams that he has even more intensify the tragedy that takes place around him and in his mind. The additional final 15 minutes that show events which, unfortunately, never take place in life, appear to be the result of the author's compassion with the main character. They are, indeed, unreal but HIGHLY ENJOYABLE. That is the quintessential of the whole art that Murnau's is and its peak of entertainment. But it is caused by one more important advantage of the whole film, particularly these final 15 minutes.The film's perfect flaw is humor. Although the content is quite saddening, the film is full of very amusing moments. Who can forget the Porter's last visit to the toilet or his facial expression while sitting at the table in his new role? I also loved the whole sequence of his niece's (Maly Delschaft) wedding. It was the last chance for him to wear a uniform, which was so honorable in the eyes of people. WONDERFUL IN NO WAY DATED HUMOR that still serves its purpose.Finally, music by Giuseppe Becce! That is something that makes you thrilled throughout. I have to admit that when I saw THE LAST LAUGH for the first time, I was glad that it is a silent film. It was destined to be made in the 1920s since dialog would destroy its whole magic together with gorgeous music that provides a viewer with marvelous experience. Although there was a remake of the film in the 1950s, it never deserved the attention of the original.To sum up, THE LAST LAUGH (1924) is a marvelous innovation for its time and still an unforgettable experience for the present generation audience. Everyone, no matter if keen on old films or not, will find something great in it. Definitely a great masterpiece, a legend of early cinema, and a must on the list of 10 all - time best movies! 10\/10!

Its not a movie like Honey, where you turn off the volume and just stare at Jessica Alba.2) Its not really about the End of Disco (despite the title). The soon to be dead Disco era is a BACKDROP for the theme of the movie. Casablanca was not about WW II. It was a romance movie, and the War was a backdrop. No one bitches about the authenticity of the airplanes, uniforms, historical details of the politics or legal procedures, or portrayal of the Moroccan culture. Yes, I wish the filmmaker was a bit more zealous about period dress and music. Oh well. And while there are reminiscent touches, its not a movie who's focus is dedicated to capturing the Disco period. If what you want is an homage to Disco, then you won't like this movie.3) It IS a Coming of Age movie. It is about vapid, just-out-of-college Americans starting out in the real world. The movie mostly skewers them, but I can't help but feel a bit of nostalgia and loss for a period of life that will never come back to me (early twentysomething). I strongly suggest you avoid the movie if you're under 35. You do not need to have lived through the disco period to appreciate the movie, but you do need to be an old fogey. Definitely a movie for adults, in the non-NC17 way.4) The actors put on superlative performances. They were portraying vapid, witless, bland, soon to be full-blown yuppies. The time period is perfect for reflecting on the contrast of soon-to-be-over perceptions of life and the world from youth to early adulthood. You can almost see their worldview evolve within the one(?) year time period of the movie. There's nothing sucky about the acting. The characters are mostly sucky people; that's why they seem wooden, vapid, and lame. (And Kate Beckinsale does an AWESOME American accent; because she's British, and there isn't a hint of her native tongue.) Yes, their dancing seems lame, because the general public are generally lame dancers. People did not break out like John Travolta on the dance floor every night. Its not a movie about dancing.5) One should be appreciating the dialogue from a detached distance, and be struck by its wit and humor. Not living through these people in a first person perspective. This is for people who can appreciate reading James Joyce, Harold Pinter, or Evelyn Waugh, or any great novelist\/playwright who doesn't beat you over the head (usually with a voice-over) with the meaning of every aspect of a scene. (Apologies if these writers aren't good examples; I'm having a problem recalling an ideal choice.) If the movie seems to drift and be aimless, its because life is not a continuous series of epiphanies, and this is not a typical Hollywood feature. If you need something more obvious, you WON'T like this movie.Its actually a bit hard to like this movie, but I do. I have met people who have lived through the Disco era and waxed poetic like Josh towards the end of the movie. They're actually yearning for the illusions of their youth; which is kind of what the movie is about.

(And Kate Beckinsale does an AWESOME American accent; because she's British, and there isn't a hint of her native tongue.)

If you need *something*, then avoid this movie like the plague. And while one may think to themself, dayam, those actresses look fine, there are no gratuitous skin shots. Its not a movie like Honey, where you turn off the volume and just stare at Jessica Alba.2) Its not really about the End of Disco (despite the title). The soon to be dead Disco era is a BACKDROP for the theme of the movie. Casablanca was not about WW II. It was a romance movie, and the War was a backdrop. No one bitches about the authenticity of the airplanes, uniforms, historical details of the politics or legal procedures, or portrayal of the Moroccan culture. Yes, I wish the filmmaker was a bit more zealous about period dress and music. Oh well. And while there are reminiscent touches, its not a movie who's focus is dedicated to capturing the Disco period. If what you want is an homage to Disco, then you won't like this movie.3) It IS a Coming of Age movie. It is about vapid, just-out-of-college Americans starting out in the real world. The movie mostly skewers them, but I can't help but feel a bit of nostalgia and loss for a period of life that will never come back to me (early twentysomething). I strongly suggest you avoid the movie if you're under 35. You do not need to have lived through the disco period to appreciate the movie, but you do need to be an old fogey. Definitely a movie for adults, in the non-NC17 way.4) The actors put on superlative performances. They were portraying vapid, witless, bland, soon to be full-blown yuppies. The time period is perfect for reflecting on the contrast of soon-to-be-over perceptions of life and the world from youth to early adulthood.

First of all, I can honestly admit that I have never been a fan of this film, even when I saw it when I was younger I never really cared for it. The problem is that this film is just too long and really just too stupid to really enjoy. That is not to say there isn't anything worth praising here but the negative significantly outweigh the positive.First of all, I'll start with the film's good points. I like how they made Jessica Lange's character actually care about Kong instead of being disgusted by him. Honestly, I have never seen the original film (yet at least) but I heard the situation was just the opposite, Fay Wray's character hated Kong. So I will at least say that at the end when Kong dies, I did at least feel some sadness for him. Its interesting to note that in Peter Jackson's film he used this approach for the relationship between the Ape and the women, instead of the one in the original film. It's developed much more in Jackson's film than here but its always been one of the most interesting aspects of this film.Then there's Kong himself. In this film, he's brought to life by make-up artist Rick Baker in a monkey suit. For the most part, I think it works pretty well. He doesn't look 100 percent convincing, since you can tell that those are not the eyes of a giant ape. Plus, there are times when Kong looks at Dwan (Jessica Langes character) and you can't help but feel thats the facial expression of a horny teenager instead of a big ape. However, I think Kong still holds up reasonably well.What doesn't look convincing in the slightest is that big snake that Kong fights. How, even in 1976, would that look convincing? It looks so fake its funny and Kong actually struggles to beat it. Seriously, it is one of the most embarrassing effects I have ever seen in a film.The acting does not really help matters either. The best of the bunch is Jeff Bridges, who actually does quite well here. The rest of the cast doesn't fair so well. Charles Grodin is embarrassingly over the top and its safe to say Jessica Lange had a less than stellar debut.To be fair, there are moments near the end of the film when she is good,when she tells Kong not to put her down or he'll be killed.The script does not help either. It contains some of the most ridiculous lines I have ever heard in a film like when Dwan asks Kong, Im a Libra, what sign are you. Then there's when she calls Kong a Goddamn chauvinist pig ape. I guess you can't entirely blame Jessica Lange for the awfulness of her performances when she is given the worst lines of all the actors. What made the relationship in the new film special is that there were very few said at all, it was mostly all non-verbal. You could see the feelings in the facial expressions of the ape and the women.That said, this film still has some impressive cinematography. The scene with the fog around the island lends an eerie atmosphere. Plus, the score by John Barry is top notch. Finally, Kongs first appearance is nicely handled. But when it comes down to it, the film is just too damn dumb to take for 134 minutes. There are some good things about this King Kong but Jackson's remake makes this one look insignificant by comparison. So the film can be occasionally fun to watch but it ends up being too much.

And I know the books were best sellers. . .among believers, anyway. And I mean no disrespect to all that.But I have to say, they stuffed this movie into a sack and beat it with the Suck Stick.I'm sure the books are much better. Really.The plot needs no reprising. If you've watched this movie, chances are you read the book. I may be one of the only people on earth who actually watched this just for the sheer bad-moving-making experience, and I wasn't disappointed. Especially not by Kirk Cameron, the creepy little Growing Pains gremlin, who came of age on that show, found Christ, and decided that the SHOW should reflect his Christian values. Well, Kirk, your career has gone to the dogs, but now you can be happy that you're spreading the word of God in movies so bad, they never even make it to theatrical release. Well, that's not strictly true I guess this was the only movie ever made that went to DVD FIRST, with a voucher for a free viewing of the movie when it was briefly released in theaters! I still have the voucher! How many people do you suppose showed up? I don't know about you, but it never came to my town. Of course, I live in NYC, where we Godless liberals sit around tearing pages out of the bible and use them to roll joints. So there you go. In fact, I'll bet out of three million people on Manhattan Island, not one would be raptured.Check out the supplementary materials on the DVD, where you'll learn the creepy behind the scenes details of these movies. . .the CAST and CREW all must be of the same religious mindset. They don't come right out and say this, but listen closely to what the filmmakers say. It's like a bunch of Pod People got together to make a Pod movie. How creepazoid is that? Honestly, this stuff just preaches to the converted, doesn't it? Can you imagine anyone who DOESN'T subscribe to the whole apocalypse thing watching this, slapping his forehead and saying, HOLY HOOVER DAM! I better get saved PRONTO! Anyhow, I'm hooked. I gotta see the rest of these Christian fiasco movies, especially the one with Gary Busey, which I think is TRIBULATIONS. At least Busey has an excuse for taking the part.. . .he cracked his head on some pavement when he crashed his motorcycle.Oy.Oh, and one more thing. What's with all the shots of poor,innocent dogs whimpering, their leashes dragging uselessly along the ground, because their owners have been called to heaven? What's up with that? Are we supposed to feel badly for the dogs, and if we do, what are we to make of God? Doesn't it IRK people that there's no room in heaven for man's best friend?

It will forever go down in history as a shining example of two of films most brilliant comedians. Not only that but it was written and directed by John Hughes in the biggest time of his life. Planes, Trains and Automobiles is a holiday film of sorts about a man whose journey across country to get home to his family becomes a wild adventure of mishaps and horrible mistakes especially when he bumps into the rather unfortunate Del Griffith. Steve Martin plays the role he's best at...the family man, who is high strung, workaholic and frustrated. It's not the first time he's done it and it certainly wasn't the last but he's enjoyable to watch doing it. He's perfect and you know exactly what to expect when Martin does a film like this. Put him together with the incomparable John Candy who is also doing his usual role as the lovable but accident prone guy. On the surface Planes, Trains, and Automobiles seems like such a typical comedy that has been made so many times but yet that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.It really is all about the star power that Candy and Martin bring to the film. They are fun to watch and they are just having a good time and the story is good enough to keep you interested. It just has something that will forever make it a classic eighties film. One of the most memorable and hilarious moments is Steve Martin's complete breakdown\/rage at the car rental office to the always amusing Edie McClurg. Normally the over usage of profanity wouldn't be funny but in this case it's hilarious!! You absolutely have to see Planes, Trains and Automobiles because it's a classic of eighties cinema and features two comedy greats in their prime directed by a man who was also in his prime for film making.

Thinking that they could be rich by this discovery that's if there's nobody on board, but there's something strange happening on this ship. They come across a lone survivor who informs them that there's an alien life form on the ship and it feeds on electricity. Sure they don't believe the person at first but when they come across machinery that has human parts attached to it they find out that the alien sees humans as some type of virus that should be wiped out.I've always been curious about this little b-grade flick and when it popped on telly last night I didn't hesitate to tune in. To begin with it looked like I was going to thoroughly enjoy myself, keeping in mind that sure I wasn't expecting anything grand, though I was hopping for some mindless, entertaining fodder. Simple as that. Actually it did deliver that in the first hour but shortly the impact started to wore thin by virtually losing itself in its many ideas. I wasn't looking for anything original in it, but heck as I sat there blankly I couldn't keep my mind off trying to think off the films it basically ripped off. Like many users have mentioned it steals its thunder from the likes of 'Alien', 'Predator' and 'The Terminator'. But no way does it reach the thrills and cleverness of those mentioned. Although while they came to my head straight away, the designs of the robots mixed with human body parts totally baffled me, that's until finally towards the end when Borgs from 'Star Trek First Contact' popped into my mind, and I see I'm not the only one to notice amongst other comments by users on this flick.'Virus' is shamelessly cheesy nonsense, beyond belief, but at the same time highly forgettable. That could be said because it plays out like a roller coaster, but without the screams and surprises, which you would like. Remarkably not its predictable hokum and spreads out the clichés rather nicely, which you rather expect. With your obvious characters, people venturing off to scramble around unknown and poorly lit places on the ship and the usual heroics. The dead weight script is your basic dribble, which is plain bad and laced with shallow remarks for humour that you wonder how can they spit this trite out. What takes the cake is that script takes itself far too seriously and therefore the acting is rather waterlogged. God only knows why Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Sutherland penned their names to this clunker. Everyone is unconvincing in their parts and just seems to float by with little effort or purpose. What was the deal with Sutherland's dreadful accent? I don't want to flatter the film too much, but there's no denying it that is held top production values, which made sure it was well made and looked rather decent. The effects and designs looked okay and there are some nifty gadgets and toys on show. There's even a tad of gore, not that much but decent enough. It's just a shame it didn't last for too long. Sometimes it was just too dark to see what was happening and that also contributed by the frenetic camera-work. Where my experience really took a turn for the worst is when it limped and mopped about before it came to its drawn out climax. Phew, close one as the ending I thought oh no not a open ending for a sequel, but the outcome is a bleated take off another recent Sci-fi flick.Routine monster on the loose Sci-fi farce that looks fair enough and provides some moments to keep you oddly amused.

They come across a lone survivor who informs them that there's an alien life form on the ship and it feeds on electricity. Sure they don't believe the person at first but when they come across machinery that has human parts attached to it they find out that the alien sees humans as some type of virus that should be wiped out.I've always been curious about this little b-grade flick and when it popped on telly last night I didn't hesitate to tune in. To begin with it looked like I was going to thoroughly enjoy myself, keeping in mind that sure I wasn't expecting anything grand, though I was hopping for some mindless, entertaining fodder. Simple as that. Actually it did deliver that in the first hour but shortly the impact started to wore thin by virtually losing itself in its many ideas. I wasn't looking for anything original in it, but heck as I sat there blankly I couldn't keep my mind off trying to think off the films it basically ripped off. Like many users have mentioned it steals its thunder from the likes of 'Alien', 'Predator' and 'The Terminator'. But no way does it reach the thrills and cleverness of those mentioned. Although while they came to my head straight away, the designs of the robots mixed with human body parts totally baffled me, that's until finally towards the end when Borgs from 'Star Trek First Contact' popped into my mind, and I see I'm not the only one to notice amongst other comments by users on this flick.'Virus' is shamelessly cheesy nonsense, beyond belief, but at the same time highly forgettable. That could be said because it plays out like a roller coaster, but without the screams and surprises, which you would like. Remarkably not its predictable hokum and spreads out the clichés rather nicely, which you rather expect. With your obvious characters, people venturing off to scramble around unknown and poorly lit places on the ship and the usual heroics. The dead weight script is your basic dribble, which is plain bad and laced with shallow remarks for humour that you wonder how can they spit this trite out. What takes the cake is that script takes itself far too seriously and therefore the acting is rather waterlogged. God only knows why Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Sutherland penned their names to this clunker. Everyone is unconvincing in their parts and just seems to float by with little effort or purpose. What was the deal with Sutherland's dreadful accent? I don't want to flatter the film too much, but there's no denying it that is held top production values, which made sure it was well made and looked rather decent. The effects and designs looked okay and there are some nifty gadgets and toys on show. There's even a tad of gore, not that much but decent enough. It's just a shame it didn't last for too long. Sometimes it was just too dark to see what was happening and that also contributed by the frenetic camera-work. Where my experience really took a turn for the worst is when it limped and mopped about before it came to its drawn out climax. Phew, close one as the ending I thought oh no not a open ending for a sequel, but the outcome is a bleated take off another recent Sci-fi flick.Routine monster on the loose Sci-fi farce that looks fair enough and provides some moments to keep you oddly amused.

The moment the music now famous as the piece that plays when we first see the desert came on, I recognized it from several movies and TV-shows. Though I didn't realize it until I saw him wearing them, I've seen Lawrence's Arabian clothes many times, several of these before I knew of the movie at all. I think that's what defines a true classic; that you know of it... before you're told. That it's everywhere, in a sense. You can't really go anywhere without hearing about it at some point, because it was such an experience, it had such an impact on people. Everything that came later was in some way influenced by it, affected by it. The first thing that struck me about this film is how beautifully shot it is; at first, I couldn't quite muster up the effort to pay full attention, thinking about how long it would be(ADD victim = yours truly), but when I finally did, I couldn't take my eyes off it again. It was mesmerizing, captivating. I couldn't possibly express through mere words how amazing the visuals are... you have to see for yourself. Some say that the film is 'flashy', but every masterpiece has its critics. I'm certainly not one of this masterpiece's. The plot is well-written and develops nicely throughout the film. The pacing is very good, I was hardly bored at any point watching it(though it is quite a behemoth of a viewing experience... three hours and twenty minutes). The acting is top-notch, and Guinness, Sharif, Quinn and O'Toole are all magnificent. The characters are well-written and credible. The cinematography and editing are both state-of-the-art. Writing in general is excellent. The dialog is truly great, both as far as writing and delivery goes. This movie contains some highly memorable and impressive war scenes, as well, for anyone out there looking for that sort of thing. The film is a timeless classic that should be seen by just about anyone, regardless of their interest in fine film-making(which this is a prime example of) or historical accuracy(which this film seems to have more than its share of). I recommend this to anyone, but I suggest you make sure you have the patience for it. Put it on and watch it until the end. You won't regret it.

It provides a good and realistic view of the life of mid- '90's New York young teenagers. However the movie falls flat when it comes to shocking the audience. Some of all the things that are happening in this movie most probably happened to everyone once in their lifetime when they were a teenager, so everyone should be able to relate to some of the characters and events that are occurring in this movie, rather than be shocked by it. But the makers obviously tried to create more than just a realistic view on teenage life, it tried to shock the audience with its 'controversity' but due to the documentary style of movie making and the story that is almost non-present, it just falls flat as a 'shocker'.I would had preferred a movie with more story and consistency in it. It would had made the movie more interesting to watch and perhaps because of that it would had also worked better in terms of shocking the audience. Now the makers only try to be controversial without just having a real story. That simply didn't worked for me.Would this movie stop teenagers from having unprotected-sex, drinking alcohol and taking drugs? I don't think so...The movie doesn't make a powerful enough impression and the ending is too abrupt and leaves an unsatisfying impression. It would had so much more interesting to see what actually truly happened to all those character after the party at the ending. The ending only leaves us guessing. Sure we mostly know what possibly happens afterward but why not show it in the movie? Those could had been some really powerful and confronting scene's but it sadly now remains nothing more than a missed opportunity.Of course all of that doesn't automatically mean that this movie is a bad one. It still is good as a raw, honest and truthful portrayal of teenage-life. What makes Kids mostly a realistic movie is not only the documentary style of movie making, it's not only the 'acting', it are not only the events occurring in this movie but it is mostly the dialog that does this.This movie marks the debut for actresses Chloë Sevigny and Rosario Dawson who both were really excellent and believable in their roles. Both impressed me. The main character to be honest didn't exactly impressed me and to me it seemed an odd choice to cast Leo Fitzpatrick. He hasn't got the right look and talent for his role, so his character doesn't quite work and is not believable enough.In short, it works well as a view on the life of teenagers but when it comes to being powerful, controversial, making a statement and leaving a message it isn't good enough. I 'enjoyed' watching this movie and thought it was really good but it simply failed at what it really tried to achieve. It didn't really mattered to me though and I could still recommend this movie to everyone. It's not a movie that makes you start thinking but it is a movie that you'll remember.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"30 December 2005","score":"5 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" The movie has a realistic, almost documentary like feeling, thanks to the way the movie is shot and acted.

Some of all the things that are happening in this movie most probably happened to everyone once in their lifetime when they were a teenager, so everyone should be able to relate to some of the characters and events that are occurring in this movie, rather than be shocked by it. But the makers obviously tried to create more than just a realistic view on teenage life, it tried to shock the audience with its 'controversity' but due to the documentary style of movie making and the story that is almost non-present, it just falls flat as a 'shocker'.I would had preferred a movie with more story and consistency in it. It would had made the movie more interesting to watch and perhaps because of that it would had also worked better in terms of shocking the audience. Now the makers only try to be controversial without just having a real story. That simply didn't worked for me.Would this movie stop teenagers from having unprotected-sex, drinking alcohol and taking drugs? I don't think so...The movie doesn't make a powerful enough impression and the ending is too abrupt and leaves an unsatisfying impression. It would had so much more interesting to see what actually truly happened to all those character after the party at the ending. The ending only leaves us guessing. Sure we mostly know what possibly happens afterward but why not show it in the movie? Those could had been some really powerful and confronting scene's but it sadly now remains nothing more than a missed opportunity.Of course all of that doesn't automatically mean that this movie is a bad one. It still is good as a raw, honest and truthful portrayal of teenage-life. What makes Kids mostly a realistic movie is not only the documentary style of movie making, it's not only the 'acting', it are not only the events occurring in this movie but it is mostly the dialog that does this.This movie marks the debut for actresses Chloë Sevigny and Rosario Dawson who both were really excellent and believable in their roles. Both impressed me. The main character to be honest didn't exactly impressed me and to me it seemed an odd choice to cast Leo Fitzpatrick. He hasn't got the right look and talent for his role, so his character doesn't quite work and is not believable enough.In short, it works well as a view on the life of teenagers but when it comes to being powerful, controversial, making a statement and leaving a message it isn't good enough. I 'enjoyed' watching this movie and thought it was really good but it simply failed at what it really tried to achieve. It didn't really mattered to me though and I could still recommend this movie to everyone.
