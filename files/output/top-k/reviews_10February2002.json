The cast is chosen very well. Joseph Fiennes does an excellent job acting as Shakespeare. He has a good feeling of how Shakespeare might have been like in his daily life. Gwyneth Paltrow is charming playing Lady Viola as well as Thomas Kent. Acting out two different parts is a big challenge. Together, Fiennes and Paltrow, harmonize perfectly. The script uses a lot of Shakespearan quotes which make the movie especially exciting when you are able to recognize them. It also takes a cute bet on how the story of Romeo&Juliet might have developed. All in all, the plot has a lot of action. You won't get tired watching it. The main focus is on Shakespeare and Viola's love story which is adorable but has not future. I highly recommend this movie because it gives you a good insight in Shakespeare's life and his time. Even though there is a lot of interpretation of Shakespeare's life (destroys authenticity) you'll have fun watching this stunning movie.

A.I. is also visually stunning with excellent performances from the actors, especially Haley Joel Osment (who was so brilliant in the Sixth Sense) but also Jude Law are very good.  It is a movie for adults and it contains disturbing scenes. (I.e. the scenes were humans are making a show out of destroying humanoid robots reminded me of Romeros' Dawn of the Dead and Savinis' remake of Night of the Living Dead.) There are also some scenes that are absurdly humoristic (I was laughing at the teddybear). You will see New York like you have never seen it before (very impressive) and hopefully never will in real life.The plot is well made and thought provoking. I know that some reviewers on IMDB do not share my opinion on this (or pretend that they don't) but I think most of them are real snobs who are comparing A.I. with how they think the movie would have been if Stanley Kubrick would have made it, the kind of people who say that they don't like the excellent Saving Private Ryan and who thinks that The Duel is Spielbergs best movie (Because it was low budget, not so commercial etc. Sure it was good, but it was not logical as far as I can remember and it was not an important movie, just a good thriller). The sheer number of people who has written reviews of A.I. is also an indication of the importance of this movie, it has emotional impact, you will not forget this movie soon after you have seen it.The movie is very good from the beginning (the scenes involving William Hurt are impressive) and the pacing is good through most of the movie (but not towards the end). It is also possible to make a comparison between the humans treatment of the robots with the nazi Holocaust (and Spielberg is jewish I believe).Negative aspects   I felt it was about half an hour too long. The ending felt tucked on and was unnecessary. Sometimes Spielberg tends to be too sentimental and he has a weakness for the supernatural which shows during the ending of the movie (thankfully only in the ending).Final comment  The ending is the weakest point, but I felt that there are two earlier moments in the movie were it could have ended and if it had the movie would have been better so I just pretend that it did. I think the ending was tucked on as a crowd pleaser but it is not a total disaster since it is not without tragic. It could have been worse.

Fine performances from the whole cast, most notably Sissy Spacek and Marisa Tomei, and the whole thing seemed so believable.  It was difficult to watch the first half hour, 45 minutes because they were doing such a good job making the Poor Dead Boy so likable and you just knew he was going to be killed, so you didn't want to get attached.  And yes, it was uncomfortably slow for almost the entire movie, but I think it was supposed to be that way.  The movie starts out passing like long, slow days of summer, then it seems to lose all momentum and curl up into a fetal position for an hour or so, which does an excellent job of reflecting the desires of the main couple.  It really adds to the experience when you can hear people talking in the halls outside the theater -- they're living their lives while you're not, and you want to be, but not badly enough to actually get up and do something about it.  You are forced to be Sissy Spacek.  It's not a pleasant experience, but I think it is right that it happens the way it does.  The direction is excellent, lots of storytelling through casual details, like a shot with Marisa Tomei talking to her ex-husband, and it's clear in the frame that he still wears his ring while she doesn't even have a tan line anymore.  Subtle and effective.  Also, in the grieving scenes, all the characters do more communicating with facial expressions or simple tasks like mowing lawns or doing other chores, and it makes it painfully clear that they're trying to deny their grief.  You want them to stop piddling around with the stupid lawnmower and talk about any guilt feelings they might have, but they don't, and you can't make them, much like the situation would be in real life.  All of this, while uncomfortable, makes In The Bedroom a marvelous film.The end ruins everything, though.  What could have been a serious and thoughtful piece worthy of viewing as a mandatory component of grief counseling becomes a mind-bogglingly inappropriate revenge crime drama.  Because while we the audience had been thinking we were watching the story of how a couple deals with their son's death, we had instead been watching the story of his murder, which changes the situation significantly.  While the last half hour or so serves to provide the only action in the film (all the violence in the beginning is off-screen, and it works really well that way, forcing the viewer to admit that he is not the heroic elf having the romance with the beautiful and fragile woman, he is instead a helpless bystander, like the parents, and later their friends), it just feels tacky.  Why bother trying to learn to help those who are grieving if revenge is the only thing that works (not that it necessarily does, I think the very end is somewhat ambiguous)?  Why sit through a practically silent movie in a silent movie theater (and I found that the audience around me was respectful enough of the subject matter and the style to sit quietly for almost the entire time) if the end makes you feel like you stepped into the low-budget stepchild of the Arnold Schwarzenegger flick playing down the hall?  I would not recommend this film to anyone who lacks a specific need to properly grieve or assist someone else in the grieving process, and even for those people, I recommend walking out when the movie makes its abrupt change of tone.

I can't really put my finger on it but for some reason it never disappoints.  It's just one of those movies.Not that it doesn't have its faults.

Just understand that this is a movie for the general public and not a documentary on life in recruit training (of any branch, enlisted or officer) and you'll enjoy it a lot more.I can still remember distinctly Gene Shallatt reviewing this film on a morning show and saying how good Louis Gossett Jr. was as Drill Instructor Foley and that it made him homesick for his old Drill Sergeant.

This is a great scene and Winger proves herself a very capable and sexy actress.The ending is, of course, classic.

I actually watched this film before the original, and it really astounded me. I love the way the audience is taken on such a joy ride with this film. The main stars are back for a second time, as is the director, with some new faces that makes this film all the more enjoyable. It is the year 1995, John Connor, the earth's redeemer, is a healthy young rebellious 10-year-old. John's mother, Sarah, is being held captive in a mental institution, against her will. However, John's life is in danger when a new type of Terminator is sent to kill him. However, the same model Cyborg that was sent to kill Sarah over a decade ago is now on a new mission. He is to protect John at any cost. The world's future lies in a machine's hands; can he save the world and John Connor? This film is a standout for me, because of the special effects that it contains. It makes the Terminator films all the more fascinating for the audience. To see a creature being able to mould itself into almost any thing was unbelievable. The credit for this side of T2 must go to the special effects team, who were brilliant at making this all seem so real, when it really isn't. The way we see the evil Terminator just transforms himself into anything he pleases is quite amazing.The cast of Terminator 2 was again, pretty good in my view. I want to first of all talk about the new stars of the series. Firstly we get to see the acting debut of unknown talent Edward Furlong. He was excellent in the role of the world's new savior, John Connor. Edward was also brilliant in the controversial film, American history X, alongside Edward Norton. That film confronted racism, had an extreme amount of violence, but was a great film to watch. The second new face in Terminator 2 was the bad guy, Robert Patrick. He role mind-blowing, in the way that we get to see him run around and then change into any figure he likes. Patrick has had an interesting career, with a short stint in the popular TV series, X-files, with some of his other film credits including Die Hard 2, The Faculty and Striptease.The cast members that returned for a second time were all pretty good in their roles. Arnold Schwarzenegger kept his promise about being back, with an exceptional role as the protective Cyborg in T2. I love the way that both him and Edward Furlong's roles are so close, it actually makes the film a much better film, considering it is not an all out violent action film. Then you have Linda Hamilton, who returns as John Connor's mother, Sarah. In this movie though, Sarah is a different person altogether. She is a psycho, who cannot escape from mental institute. I read one person's opinion on her role, saying that it was almost over the top. I disagree, considering her character needed to change, it would not have suited the films if she were not the tough girl in the second film. Terminator 2, while it is a much better film, because of the time it was made and the budget it would have had, it does in some way resemble the first film. I guess it had to. I am not talking about the storyline, but some scenes that are included in it. The one scene that is similar would have to be the nitrogen truck scene, where the two Terminators do battle. I loved it, but I can understand some viewers not. There other scenes in this movie, which feels like a carbon of the first, but are more paced making them much better. I am talking about such scenes as the motorbike chase when the evil terminator is trying to kill John, not to similar to the first film when the evil terminator is trying to kill Sarah. Then again we do have the special effect scenes that are just amazing, where the evil Cyborg is able to make himself turn into almost anything he pleases. The scene are all outstanding, with the best scenes being the ones where we see him running around the mental hospital, with him in front everyone walking through a metal door. The doctor that did not believe any of Sarah's stories is left dumbfounded by what he sees. These scenes would have taken months of planning, but they were done to perfection.So with all that in mind, I can only praise this terrific sequel. James Cameron has out done himself. He has had a funny career and life for that matter. One of his biggest films was of course Titanic, which I can no longer bear to watch and he had been married five times, with one of his five wives being Terminator star, Linda Hamilton. All that aside he has had a winner with the terminator projects. We are in for a treat as there is to be a Terminator 3 in 2003, which hopefully can be as good as its predecessors.   The people I ask have constantly told me that Terminator 2 is the better of the two films. I cannot disagree with that. With its great special effects and cast nothing will change the public's mind about this movie. Sit back, relax and be blown away by T2 Judgment Day, Hasta la vista, baby!Rating 4.5 Stars or 9\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"10 February 2002","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Terminator 2 would have to be one of the world's greatest movie sequels.

The direction is obviously very good from a technical standpoint and it really catches your attention so you don't feel sleepy besides the long duration of the film.

I'm guessing that the? grand master has put some kind of Deux-ex-machina explanation in his script to make this all tie together (maybe some of the facts\/minor stories are explained by the fact that they were (?)

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"10 February 2002","score":"","review":"  I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, from about a year ago, when I first found out about it.  It started out promising enough, but as time went on, I started to doubt more and more.  There were too many inconsistencies in the plot, and certain minor details didn't add up.  (And, it had some of the worst editing I have ever seen.)  Here's a few examples*MAJOR SPOILERS*  1)  For instance, who the heck is Sergei?  They went to his apartment, they got ambushed, then there was a quick mention of him getting killed.  But, I still don't know who he was, or why I was supposed to care about him.  And why was there a riot?  No details are given, or if they are, they aren't given in English.2)  Why shoot the night-time chase scene in NightScope Vision?  It was probably supposed to be artistic or something, but GOD was it annoying!  And even with all the green lighting to distract you, you can't miss the fact that there's no way Jonathan could have gotten on the motorcycle from the driver's seat that quickly.  When it first happened, I thought he got left behind.  Then, they cut to a close-up, and he's riding on the back.  Plus, when they busted through the barbed-wire fence, and it made that cartoon boing sound, my friend and I laughed out loud.  It was so wrong!!3)  Why did it take four months for the first act of violence to occur after Jonathan arrives?  I say that, because after the first one, we are lead to believe it happens every single game.  Or, at least, every single game that has low ratings.  So, what, they didn't have low ratings before?  It just doesn't fit.I think the movie's biggest problem was trying to fit an ultra-violent storyline into a PG-13 rating.  It's like they changed their minds after they filmed it.  4)  Because when Jonathan and his boss are talking at the mines, Jean Reno's mouth clearly says the F word, but it was re-looped, so he says fooling, instead.  Like it was edited for television.5)  At the climax scene at the end, when they are trying to beat Jonathan to death, there is blood coming from cuts on his face, and coming from his mouth.  But, in the next shot, the blood and cuts are mostly gone, and there are black smudges on his face and clothes.  The rest of the players who were fighting suddenly look the same, also.  It appears as if there was some gory blood effects that were digitally altered to make them not so violent.  Jonathan's shirt also looks like he was just sweating or something, but you know it had to be covered in his own blood at one point.  How much did all the digital cleanup cost, I wonder?6)  The love scene suffers the same fate.  It has no tension, passion or anything worth caring about, not to mention that it lasted all of 5 seconds.  Why put it in the movie, then?  It didn't last long enough to establish Aurora and Jonathan as an item, so what good did it do?  Either make it longer and more interesting or take it out completely.  Again, it's the PG-13 curse.  I believe if they had made this movie with an 'R' rating in mind, it would have been MUCH more interesting, and it would have flowed a lot smoother.  They screwed it up by trying to patch it up.And, I just got home from the movie, and I can't remember how it ended.  I mean, I know he killed his oppressors, and he walks down a hallway with Aurora... people are now worshiping him.  But, I can't remember what happens between that and the credits rolling.  I hope that's not how it actually ended.  That's how bad it was.  There's no lasting memory, no parting shot that makes a difference.Oh, well... it was all worth it to see Slipknot.
