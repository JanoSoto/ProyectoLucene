There have been other attempts at bringing video games to the big screen that had miserable results.  Of course, we all remember the ill-fated Mario Brothers movie.  MORTAL KOMBAT was probably the biggest let down.  TOMB RAIDER was not as bad, but still failed to really wow audiences.  So far, I would say RESIDENT EVIL is the best video-game-gone-big-screen so far.  The plot outline is pretty simple  A team of commandos venture in to a secret corporate research base to discover what went wrong and why all the employees were killed off.  They find out that horrible experiments were taking place and a biological terror is released in the form of vicious, flesh-eating zombies.  They have to find the antidote and get out before they are sealed inside forever.  The film moves fast.  There are a lot of scares, some of which are set up with fast editing, but the film pulls it off effectively.  The gore abounds and is VERY well done.  Some of the disfigurements of the zombies was done with CGI to great effect.  There is one zombie that is missing a large portion of his head, which pretty much looks like swiss cheese, and that effect is both startling and grotesque.  I loved!  And if Zombies are not enough for you, there are also zombie dobermans.  And if that doesn't give you nightmares, there is a big, Frankenstien\/Alien-from-hell monster that breaks loose from its incubation chamber that probably will give you nightmares. Besides the great effects, there are a lot of cool scenes throughout the movie.  The highlight of which is probably the part where the commandos are sliced up with a laser beam.  Also, the gore effects here are fantastic.  (The end of the guy's knife getting sliced off and falling on the floor was a nice touch!)  In fact, this movie is a lot gorier than I anticipated it would be.  It is much more gore-infested than most movies that have been coming out in recent years.  So that is a breath of fresh air to a horror fan like me.  In some ways, the movie amounts to a very well done B horror flick.  If you are like me, you will love that kind of stuff.  Although this is not a perfect movie, the second act is long and well developed.  By this I refer to the characters getting further and further in to trouble.  The situation gets worse, and then, just when you think the situation could not get any worse, it gets WORSE still!  Which creates some good suspense and great action scenes which build up to a fantastic third act with an exciting final battle on the train.  Without giving anything away, I will just say that the conclusion was really well done.  I really liked the ending, not only because it was creepy and the final special effect was really grandiose, but because we get to see Milla Jovovich's muffin...who could ask for anything better?  She certainly doesn't seem to have a problem getting naked, which is a good thing.  Made me reminisce of the good old horror movies of the early 80's.  Only two minor complaints.  The part where Milla starts breaking everybody's neck, I didn't really buy that.  The human neck doesn't break so easily.  Although, dying with Milla's thighs wrapped around my neck sounds like a pretty nice way to go.  And sometimes the characters get in to deep trouble and then the movie doesn't really explain how they got out of that trouble.  This doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film, however. If you liked ALIENS and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (my all time favorite horror\/zombie movie) then you will like RESIDENT EVIL.

I had not yet read Tolkien's books. After seeing this film, I almost didn't want to.  The only reason I still DID was to find out if they were this bad.  (Thankfully, the books are excellent, and I'm very glad I read them.) I am not going to comment on the animation or drawing or colors (except in regards to how characters act or are portrayed), because generally I don't comment on those even if they're bad unless I don't have much else to talk about.  Special effects and the like do not alone a movie make, nor do they alone a movie destroy. ;-) Besides, this one has plenty of other stuff to destroy it. First, condensing the Fellowship of the Ring and half of The Two Towers into one film was a bad idea.  Even the recent live action version, doing only one book, had to cut a lot of stuff.  This cut a lot more, and in worse places.  The opening is blazed through with cuts from scene to scene so sudden I couldn't follow what was going on even after I'd read the books (Several times.  I love Tolkien.). Gandalf seems very...creepy, which is very strange, because I've always taken him as a somewhat friendly, if a bit mysterious, type.  He waves his arms at every single opportunity, which is...uh...odd.  (Not an animation problem, a portrayal problem.)  In the book, I cried at his fall.  In this...it's kind of an eh. Aragorn, as well, is far too mysterious...the first scene with him is alright as far as that goes, but the hobbits are supposed to be friends with him after a little while, and that never happens.  He's also the world's worst swordsman--and not because of bad animation, because better fighting is shown throughout the film.  He just screws up every time he draws his sword. Boromir.  Don't even get me started on Boromir.  How did they get the idea he was a Viking?  I think they were really trying to hammer home the point that he was going to do something bad, too, because he's consistently nasty and mean throughout the movie, while in the book he really seems like a nice enough guy up until he snaps, and right afterwards he pretty much goes back to being a decent guy.  In the book, I cried when he died (and still do, each time I read it).  In this...I just didn't really have any reaction. It wasn't that I hated him or anything, I just didn't really care. Legolas.  Legolas seems decent enough to me. Gimli.  Nothing too terribly wrong, really...but for the fact that he's as tall as everyone else.  Uh...does the word dwarf suggest anything to you? Hobbits.  Seem pretty much fine, except for Sam.  Sam is 1) Ugly, 2) Stupid, 3) Clumsy and 4) Homosexual.  None of these four are suggested by the books. Gollum.  Gollum is a noise he makes in his throat in his lines, guys, not a word.  Kind of a trouble swallowing sort of thing.  Listen to Tolkien reading The Hobbit if you're having trouble figuring that out. With most monsters, my only comments would be on the way they were drawn, so I'll restrain myself.  The Black Riders, however, should not have been limping like old horror movie zombies.  These guys are supposed to be frightening.  They seem almost comical. The acting is awful.  Just plain awful.  No emotion is shown at any point of the film, in any fashion.  Saruman is pronounced Aruman, which I wouldn't have a problem with...except that they only do it some of the time, like they couldn't decide.  Just flip a coin if you're having trouble, guys. With problems like these, it shouldn't really come as a surprise that the film simply doesn't involve the watcher in the plot at all.  I tried. Believe me, I tried to care about any of the characters, but I couldn't. In only one scene--the Helm's Deep battle--was I getting slightly pulled into things, and even then, it was broken up every time I saw Aragorn's awful swordsmanship. This movie is a terrible interpretation of Tolkien's works, and I'm very glad the crew was unable to complete the destruction with the second part of The Two Towers and The Return of the King.  If I'd seen those I'm pretty sure I would never have read Tolkien, and thus I would have missed out on quite possibly the best books I have ever read in my life.  Somehow, the makers of this film managed to take something that good and turn it into one of the most awful cinematic experiences of my life.

He's also the world's worst swordsman--and not because of bad animation, because better fighting is shown throughout the film.  He just screws up every time he draws his sword. Boromir.  Don't even get me started on Boromir.  How did they get the idea he was a Viking?  I think they were really trying to hammer home the point that he was going to do something bad, too, because he's consistently nasty and mean throughout the movie, while in the book he really seems like a nice enough guy up until he snaps, and right afterwards he pretty much goes back to being a decent guy.  In the book, I cried when he died (and still do, each time I read it).  In this...I just didn't really have any reaction. It wasn't that I hated him or anything, I just didn't really care. Legolas.  Legolas seems decent enough to me. Gimli.  Nothing too terribly wrong, really...but for the fact that he's as tall as everyone else.  Uh...does the word dwarf suggest anything to you? Hobbits.  Seem pretty much fine, except for Sam.  Sam is 1) Ugly, 2) Stupid, 3) Clumsy and 4) Homosexual.  None of these four are suggested by the books. Gollum.  Gollum is a noise he makes in his throat in his lines, guys, not a word.  Kind of a trouble swallowing sort of thing.  Listen to Tolkien reading The Hobbit if you're having trouble figuring that out. With most monsters, my only comments would be on the way they were drawn, so I'll restrain myself.  The Black Riders, however, should not have been limping like old horror movie zombies.  These guys are supposed to be frightening.  They seem almost comical. The acting is awful.  Just plain awful.  No emotion is shown at any point of the film, in any fashion.  Saruman is pronounced Aruman, which I wouldn't have a problem with...except that they only do it some of the time, like they couldn't decide.  Just flip a coin if you're having trouble, guys. With problems like these, it shouldn't really come as a surprise that the film simply doesn't involve the watcher in the plot at all.  I tried. Believe me, I tried to care about any of the characters, but I couldn't. In only one scene--the Helm's Deep battle--was I getting slightly pulled into things, and even then, it was broken up every time I saw Aragorn's awful swordsmanship. This movie is a terrible interpretation of Tolkien's works, and I'm very glad the crew was unable to complete the destruction with the second part of The Two Towers and The Return of the King.  If I'd seen those I'm pretty sure I would never have read Tolkien, and thus I would have missed out on quite possibly the best books I have ever read in my life.

I had not yet read Tolkien's books. After seeing this film, I almost didn't want to.  The only reason I still DID was to find out if they were this bad.  (Thankfully, the books are excellent, and I'm very glad I read them.) I am not going to comment on the animation or drawing or colors (except in regards to how characters act or are portrayed), because generally I don't comment on those even if they're bad unless I don't have much else to talk about.  Special effects and the like do not alone a movie make, nor do they alone a movie destroy. ;-) Besides, this one has plenty of other stuff to destroy it. First, condensing the Fellowship of the Ring and half of The Two Towers into one film was a bad idea.  Even the recent live action version, doing only one book, had to cut a lot of stuff.  This cut a lot more, and in worse places.  The opening is blazed through with cuts from scene to scene so sudden I couldn't follow what was going on even after I'd read the books (Several times.  I love Tolkien.). Gandalf seems very...creepy, which is very strange, because I've always taken him as a somewhat friendly, if a bit mysterious, type.  He waves his arms at every single opportunity, which is...uh...odd.  (Not an animation problem, a portrayal problem.)  In the book, I cried at his fall.  In this...it's kind of an eh.

I first thought it was confusing because I didn't really get what was happening until the very end.  But even when I saw the end I still wasn't sure of what really happened!  I think this was the point of the movie. The story was about a man dealing with denial because his wife was brutally raped.  He catches the two rapists in the act and he kills one of them. But the other one escapes.  This is where I think the self denial comes in because the man will never find his wife's other rapist and doesn't really want to believe that.  The man also developes short term memory loss due to the accident, meaning that he can't make any new memories.  This is a very big problem because other people see his weakness and use it to make him do things for them.  He believes that if he writes himself notes that he can rely on them, but he really can't.  I think that the movie leaves the viewer with a mystery for him\/her to make a conclusion from.  But I don't think that there is a real conclusion and that many people might be to quick to come up with one just to comfort themselves or make them feel more secure.

Ever since the first rumors of a Resident Evil movie had risen, I was hyped. One of my favorite gaming series was to be made into a major motion picture?So it only seems fitting that I saw Resident Evil the weekend it came out. I sat in the theater, popcorn and soda in hand, awaiting a movie that I hoped would impress me and make the wait worth it. What I got was a disjointed and poorly executed movie.I was miffed.Resident Evil the movie follows practically nothing the games contain, except for the Umbrella Corporation, The T-Virus, and a few familiar monsters popping up. However, I wasn't expecting the movie to follow the game too closely, so this wasn't necessarily the reason for my discontent.The reason for that rested in the fact that as a stand alone movie, Resident Evil was a pretty poor attempt. Aside from some cool scenes, the plot was horrible, it seemed at times the director wanted to make it deep but failed horribly. The other main problem with the movie was the fact that it seemed more like a slide show of sorts...there would be a plot part (weak as heck), then suddenly, we'd have a Zombie part, then another plot part, then a dog part, then a plot part...etc. It was very disjointed.

One of the monsters in the movie is a Licker from Resident Evil 2 (the game). They fail to see that and call it a Hunter which is a monster from RE1. That's a small fact but it's enough to turn off someone who likes the games. But forget about that. It's basically the fact that it's a weak movie no matter how you cut it. Mila Jovovich is the only reason to see it. She's hot. Simple as that. Otherwise, if you respect the games, dont sour your feelings. It's only a movie. Go and see it anyway, but beware, it really really isn't a good one. I'll take day of the dead over this any day. Resident Evil took itself way to seriously for it's poor content.

I don't consider myself one that abuses it although I do get irritated when watching phony sentimentality, I do not mind movies that aim for the heart. Honestly, I don't even mind movies that get a little manipulative in this respect, unless of course the manipulation is downright insulting (and sadly, it is not that rare).Now, are you a fan of plot twists? Because I am going to start with one in this review already forget about the word 'saccharine', because A Beautiful Mind, despite what a few people said, did manage not to insult the viewer's intelligence by inserting too many syrupy scenes. The bad news is, however, that this has brought a denouement about Howard's real capabilities. Quite frankly, he has not matured into the awesome director they want us to see.What's that? You're saying that the aforementioned plot twist was not very good? Well, you will not find much better in the film.A Beautiful Mind tells the fictionalized story of John Nash (Russell Crowe), Noble prize winner who struggled for most of his life with schizophrenia. In the beginning of the film, we meet Nash as a student in Princeton. He is a strange individual, apparently shy and volatile; he often speaks his mind out loud and ends up being ridiculed by students with better social skills. Apparently, Nash is also experiencing troubles with his studies, but he is constantly looking for a revolutionary idea that would permit him to be remembered as an innovator and good mathematician. One day, in a bar where he is putting into mathematics a method to pick up girls, he comes up with a theory so revolutionary that, in the future, the world of economics and beyond will literally be changed by it.Years later, following the success of his theory, Nash is working for a government agency and is a professor at the Massachuttes Institute of Technology; here, he meets Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) and falls in love with her. However, for Nash life is not as easy as it sounds, as soon he -- and the viewers -- will get to learn that part of his world is not quite what he thinks. He is suffering from schizophrenia, and with the progressive degeneration of it both his love life and his work as a mathematician are at risk of being destroyed forever. Will love and genius triumph over tragedy?OK, this last question sounds a little overdone and goofy, but it is not so dissimilar from level of depth that A Beautiful Mind maintains through the film. The problem with A Beautiful Mind is not so much that the film takes liberties with John Nash's story, but rather that these liberties are the result of poor presentation and weak ideas.I have never read in its entirety the book that tells the real (not fictionalized) story of John Nash, but I am aware that the nature of some of his hallucinations is not played the way it is played in the film; the clear boundaries between reality and delusions are suppressed in the film to surprise the viewer with a plot twist. Fine, I am a fan of plot twists when they add something in terms of significance, but here it is clearly done only for entertainment value. The same can be said about many events in Nash's real life that in the movie are skipped, distorted or changed. It is clear that the aim of A Beautiful Mind is not to change a true story in order to explore the mind of a troubled genius, but rather to present a product as clean and accessible to the public as possible. And while this has apparently guaranteed big cash and the Academy consideration, it didn't fool me. You see, Howard's Cocoon did not have ambitions to be much more than a fairy tale, and on that level it was perfectly enjoyable. A Beautiful Mind is not a fairy tale, and I think we should expect a little more than a story where everything is on the surface.I am not condemning the fact that A Beautiful Mind took a true story and fictionalized it, but rather the fact that it did not do so to add levels of depth to it; it did so to make it the most commercially palatable. Symbolism, psychical discourses, and mathematics are pretty much completely absent, and the glimpses of Nash's genius are put on screen through 'romanticized', computer-generated visual effects; anything that could have possibly disturbed the public has been removed. I am quite positive that even a documentary-like approach to John Nash's story would have given more insight about the human mind and more though-provoking material. A Beautiful Mind is not a terrible motion picture, it is a terribly average motion picture, one that would have satisfied me if it was a made-for-TV production.The acting is satisfying. Crowe, who inexplicably won last year for his mediocre portrayal of Maximus in Gladiator, is up for another Oscar this year. His work here is certainly good, but not great. Jennifer Connelly has been better before, but she is equally satisfying.Sadly, A Beautiful Mind cannot be recommended, and the fact that it was nominated for multiple Academy Awards probably puts a final word about the real meaning I give to the Oscars.6\/10 ","genre":"Biography, Drama"},{"date":"17 March 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" 'Saccharine' is one of those adjectives that moviegoers use and abuse. I don't consider myself one that abuses it although I do get irritated when watching phony sentimentality, I do not mind movies that aim for the heart. Honestly, I don't even mind movies that get a little manipulative in this respect, unless of course the manipulation is downright insulting (and sadly, it is not that rare).Now, are you a fan of plot twists? Because I am going to start with one in this review already forget about the word 'saccharine', because A Beautiful Mind, despite what a few people said, did manage not to insult the viewer's intelligence by inserting too many syrupy scenes. The bad news is, however, that this has brought a denouement about Howard's real capabilities. Quite frankly, he has not matured into the awesome director they want us to see.What's that? You're saying that the aforementioned plot twist was not very good? Well, you will not find much better in the film.A Beautiful Mind tells the fictionalized story of John Nash (Russell Crowe), Noble prize winner who struggled for most of his life with schizophrenia. In the beginning of the film, we meet Nash as a student in Princeton. He is a strange individual, apparently shy and volatile; he often speaks his mind out loud and ends up being ridiculed by students with better social skills. Apparently, Nash is also experiencing troubles with his studies, but he is constantly looking for a revolutionary idea that would permit him to be remembered as an innovator and good mathematician. One day, in a bar where he is putting into mathematics a method to pick up girls, he comes up with a theory so revolutionary that, in the future, the world of economics and beyond will literally be changed by it.Years later, following the success of his theory, Nash is working for a government agency and is a professor at the Massachuttes Institute of Technology; here, he meets Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) and falls in love with her. However, for Nash life is not as easy as it sounds, as soon he -- and the viewers -- will get to learn that part of his world is not quite what he thinks. He is suffering from schizophrenia, and with the progressive degeneration of it both his love life and his work as a mathematician are at risk of being destroyed forever. Will love and genius triumph over tragedy?OK, this last question sounds a little overdone and goofy, but it is not so dissimilar from level of depth that A Beautiful Mind maintains through the film. The problem with A Beautiful Mind is not so much that the film takes liberties with John Nash's story, but rather that these liberties are the result of poor presentation and weak ideas.I have never read in its entirety the book that tells the real (not fictionalized) story of John Nash, but I am aware that the nature of some of his hallucinations is not played the way it is played in the film; the clear boundaries between reality and delusions are suppressed in the film to surprise the viewer with a plot twist. Fine, I am a fan of plot twists when they add something in terms of significance, but here it is clearly done only for entertainment value. The same can be said about many events in Nash's real life that in the movie are skipped, distorted or changed. It is clear that the aim of A Beautiful Mind is not to change a true story in order to explore the mind of a troubled genius, but rather to present a product as clean and accessible to the public as possible.
