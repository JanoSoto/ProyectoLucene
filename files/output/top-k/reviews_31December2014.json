It's one of those flicks that really connect with anyone viewing. Bill Murray brings a stunning witty character on this film. Let's talk about the soundtrack. My favorite part in this picture is the scene where Max drops out of the public school he's forced into and I Am Waiting by the Rolling Stones plays over the montage.

As a whole, I had a decent time watching the film. It began to drag a little during the second half and they could have probably cut 15-20 minutes (for example the whole Mexico part) and it would have been equally good or even better with a runtime under 2 hours. At some point, I felt that the whole scheme scenario simply got a bit repetitive and at the end it was also one twist too many for my taste when he shot his brother. That brother is played by Sean Penn shortly after his very first Academy Award nomination. The female main character is played by Deborah Kara Unger in her probably most known role. She disappeared from the limelight quickly unlike Penn and Douglas. Other than that, the far-too-early-deceased James Rebhorn plays one of the bigger roles as well and I quite enjoyed watching him here.My favorite scene of the film is probably the White Rabbit-scene. The song is great and fit the tone and visuals of the return of the main character to his house just perfectly. The newscaster speaking to Douglas' character was a nice inclusion as well. I am a bit surprised this film did not get any awards attention at all. Fincher was very famous at that point already. However, I have to say that I had quite a few problems with the whole plot. There were a handful scenes that they could not have foreseen his actions entirely and yet it was supposed to look like they always had everything under control. And let's not forget the risk factor. If the Game was common for upper class, there must have been some kind of accident in the past if they risk the players having guns or almost drown in their car. People would have sued this company a hundred times already I guess. So, yeah, it is a truly unrealistic film for more reasons than one. But if you manage to look past that, you can still have a pretty good time. Nonetheless I have to say, I was slightly unimpressed with Douglas here. Given the fact we see the film completely from his perspective and he is in absolutely every scene from start to finish for 2 hours, his performances did not wow me the way I had hoped.As a whole, Brancato and Ferris did a solid job with the script (also the transformation of Douglas' character from being the grinch he is early on), especially looking at the fact that they are the ones behind Catwoman. It is by no means flawless, but certainly has its strengths. The movie itself can be described just like that. Recommended.

The color is nice and I certainly appreciate the production values but it's largely wasted on a plodding melodrama with too many opera numbers. Despite being part of Universal's horror stable, it really isn't a horror film. Claude Rains may play the title character but he takes a backseat (and third billing) to Nelson Eddy and Susanna Foster as two parts of an insufferably banal love triangle. The other part belongs to Edgar Barrier. Both Eddy and Barrier are considerably older than Foster, which doesn't help matters. For his part, Rains is good though miscast and not in the film nearly enough. Nelson Eddy, with risibly darkened hair and a pencil mustache, is flavorless and boring. Susanna Foster sings nicely (if you're into that sort of music) but gives a performance so forgettably bland you will likely have a hard time remembering what she looked like after the movie is over.In addition to being dull and lacking any real horror traits, the movie has a number of other flaws. Lame comic relief, for one thing. It's also plagued by plot gremlins and some ridiculous moments that fall into the category of unintentional comedy. Look no further than the scene where Rains' Phantom uses a small hacksaw to cut through a very thick chain holding up a chandelier in one big scene. It resembles something out of a cartoon and is impossible to take seriously. The big scene where the Phantom's mask is removed is marred by an underwhelming makeup job on Rains. Gone is the horrible visage of Lon Chaney's Phantom. Now we have a man with a disfiguring scar but hardly something monstrous. In an early draft of the script, Rains was to have been revealed to be Foster's father but they changed that. However, the original idea hangs over the film and gives it a weird vibe (Somehow I always felt drawn to him). The explanation we're given in the end for why Rains cared so much for Foster is that they were from the same town! This is one of my least favorite Universal horror films. I have watched most of the others repeatedly, some dozens of times. But this is one I have only seen a few times. I went into watching this today hoping my opinion would be changed after not having seen it for probably close to a decade. But my opinion is the same now as then. The movie is watchable, particularly for Universal completists, but there is no real horror and way too much romance, humor, and music. A little more Phantom and a little less opera, please. The sets, some of which were holdovers from the 1925 film, were reused for The Climax with Boris Karloff the following year. That movie was to have been a sequel to this but was reworked as a separate but similar film.

He does a solid job with the character. Raimi was mostly known at this point for another trilogy, namely the Evil Dead movies, which he started directing in his early 20s already. Apart from Maguire, the cast has many more famous names. Kirsten Dunst plays the love interest Mary Jane. I'm usually not too big on her as an actress, but she is okay here. Peter's uncle and aunt are played by Academy Award winner Cliff Robertson (who sadly died not too long ago just like his character here) and Golden Globe winner Rosemary Harris. The main antagonist, the Green Goblin, is played by Willem Dafoe and may very well be my favorite character and performance of the film. His son (and at the same time best friend to Parker) is played by the young rising star James Franco. J.K. Simmons has a small role here and he may very well win the Oscar this year. He certainly makes J. Jonah Jameson his own. And finally, Octavia Spencer, long before she became famous and won her Academy Award, plays a one-scene character as well.I wrote in the title that there is almost nothing wrong with this movie and you'd have to dig really deep to find something, maybe this could be the end. I found Mary Jane's love confession too cheesy somehow and Peter's reaction left a bitter taste too. It's the girl he loved all his life and he just says no to her. Cannot believe that even with the whole power-responsibility reference. But back to the more positive things. One of my favorite parts was how Parker and Osborn (Dafoe) had such similar paths to what they became. What Parker wanted most was MJ, what Osborn wanted most was the success of his company. First, both fight against outside influences (the enemy company, Flash), then against inside influences (the sale, Harry Osborn) in order to get what they want. Parker succeeds and fights for the good side. Osborn Sr. fails and becomes evil. Of course, apart from that, a large role was also played by the death of Parker's uncle and how it all happened. It basically showed Parker that negative actions happening to other people can also affect him if he does not intervene.The movie runs for roughly two hours. There is a very clean split for Parker. The first half is about him being a normal boy who discovers his superpowers and we find out how he becomes Spider Man (including a funny wrestling match), who the people in his life are and how they shape him. The second half is pretty much all about the battle between Spider Man and the Green Goblin. Here, I especially liked the scene when the Osborn realizes Spiderman's identity. That disguise scene in the burning house was great fun too. In the end, with the last comments from Franco's character, we get a bit of an appetizer for the sequel. On a random side-note, Raimi just recently reunited with Franco for Oz.You could probably discuss if Maguire is a better actor than Andrew Garfield, but I have to say I definitely prefer Maguire's Spiderman. It works so well, even if he is already in his 20s playing a teenager and there are many memorable scenes in this film, including the kiss between Mary Jane and Spiderman obviously. Thumbs up for writer David Koepp who has also shown his talent on Jurassic Park and Mission impossible before 2002. And lets not forget Steve Ditko and Stan Lee, the latter even has a little cameo here. And finally a shoutout to Kevin O'Connell and Greg P. Russell, who scored one of the film's two Academy Award nominations and it seems they just cannot get the win. They would have deserved it for this one. Such a shame. The first Spiderman movie was, by far, the most seen film from the year 2002. Crowd magnets like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars came short. And for good reason. This is one hell of a joyride. Very much recommended.

I think the very first time I watched this film, I found myself so overwhelmed; not just by the incredible message, but by the beautiful character development and bond the characters share during the film. I think everyone who watches this film can relate to the majority of the five main characters of the film. The first time I watched this movie I couldn't help but identify traits from all five stereotypes in the film in retrospect to my own high school self. The film takes place in a High School on a Saturday, where three very different students are acquainted with one other to undergo a weekend detention. The five are each individually categorised as certain stereotypes; Jock, Basketcase, Princess, Brain and Criminal. Each of these stereotypes are common in the vast majority of High Schools and I think the whole development of these character-types is genius for that specific reason. The five characters initially appear to hate one another (though some share unlikely bonds throughout the movie) and eventually open up to one another towards the end of the film. I love how the characters sympathise with one another and eventually gain empathy for one another, even though they are completely different and lead completely different lives. It is almost like their meeting changed each and every one of them for the better and they each take away a specific quality from each other by the end of the film. I especially love the many different messages relating to morality and individualism within the film, these include; Everybody is equal. Respect one another. Treat others how you would like to be treated, and most Importantly Everybody is different. This film has had a lasting effect on me since the day I put the DVD in my player. This film will almost certainly be in my heart due to the love I have for it. And, I think it is more than safe to say; I won't forget about this film. Ever!

Their initial Golden Age ended with the Jungle Book, followed by a revival during the 80s and 90s. More recently, they've come back to the top again with The Princess and the Frog, Tangled and Frozen.It's interesting that both the directors of Tarzan were involved with this latest renaissance Chris Buck co-directed Frozen (with Jennifer Lee), and Kevin Lima got it all started with Enchanted, which re-assessed the glittering Disney back-catalogue, and came away with an attitude that was affectionate, yes, but not actually reverential. Sadly, there is little evidence in Tarzan of that healthier relationship with the legacy.The setting is a problem, for me. I grew up with Disney films that each had a distinctive setting, be it Arabia or under the sea. However, The Jungle Book had already covered, erm, jungle, and The Lion King had done Africa. An adult perception says that the African jungle is distinct from both of these, but Disney are not about adult, subtle distinctions.Another problem with Tarzan is the soundtrack. I found Phil Collins' voice dull and detached throughout, and when I bothered to tune into the lyrics, they just explained what I could already see was going on on-screen, thus making them pointless. Okay, they got Elton John in to make good songs for The Lion King, and there are versions sung by him, but they are distinctly poorer in my book, and in the main film I am glad they stuck with the cast as singers.The animation is pretty good for the period, especially in the sequences where Tarzan is racing through the branches... although they are also suspiciously reminiscent of a roller-coaster ride, coming from the company that must always be on the lookout for new Disneyland attractions. The movements of Tarzan and his ape 'family' are also well-observed, I was pleased to note.Such a shame, then, that the character of Tarzan himself (as voiced by Tony Goldwyn) is so unengaging. I'm not sure why it is; he certainly has enough character drama, what with an identity crisis and overall coming-of-age in classic film style.

What I mean by realism is that this movie does not contain an impervious and immortal action hero, the main hero is very capable of taking damage, and as one who has seen this movie knows, he takes plenty of it. The movie is over 2 hours long, and it never stalls at all, everything is tense from start to finish. And even better, the action isn't mindless, it is all relevant to the plot of the movie (a problem with most of today's action pictures). And on top of all of that, we see some great performances from a very talented cast, and in the next couple of paragraphs, I will talk about it.Bruce Willis gives one of his best performances as John McClane, a New York cop visiting his wife at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve. John and Holly (his wife's name) haven't been seeing eye to eye lately, and they begin to have an argument but it ends when Holly is called up for something. Later, things turn sour when a group of terrorists arrive and seize everybody inside as hostages. John escapes, and has to reluctantly become a hero in order to save everyone. Thankfully, this movie didn't throw in an unnecessary romance plot, as that probably would have had bad effects on the movie as a whole. Simply put, John McClane hasn't been on good terms with his wife lately, and he suddenly has to save her when she and everyone else inside the building end up being held hostageThe terrorists are lead by Hans Gruber, played fabulously by Alan Rickman. Gruber is the perfect villain in my opinion. He is a suave and sophisticated, but at the same time, menacing villain. And also, he does not hesitate to follow up on the threats that he issues. The perfect example of that would be when he is interrogating Joseph Takagi about the codes to a vault containing 640 million. Takagi says I don't know it, I'm telling you. Get on a jet to Tokyo and ask the Chairman. I'm telling you, you're just going to have to kill me. Hans replies Okay. And then...well, not much to say, except that it cements Gruber's place as a threatening villain.On another side note, there are some more good performances from the cast. Another one in particular is Reginald VelJohnson, who plays Sgt. Al Powell. Powell is haunted by a particular episode which involved shooting a kid that he thought was carrying a gun, but turned out to be only a toy. However, near the end of the movie, he gets an act of redemption, but what is it? Watch the movie to see. William Atherton gives a somewhat comical performance as Richard Thornburg, a reporter who ends up getting on the wrong side of McClane's wife (and it shows in the sequel to this movie, by the way).And like I mentioned, John McClane is different from your usual action hero. McClane is depicted as being a hero that's not a glory seeker and invincible, but as being reluctant and vulnerable. There are several instances in this movie in which he takes a serious beating, such as there's a scene where some glass gets shot up, and he's not wearing any shoes, and his feet end up getting badly cut. It's not often that we get a vulnerable hero like that, but at the same time, it's very good, because not only is it different from the ones that we see so often, but it also adds some realism to it.John McTiernan helms the director's reins, and he does an absolutely superb job as far as his directing is concerned. McTiernan gives this movie an edge that contains skill and energy, which really helps escalate this movie to the level of a masterpiece. As a matter of fact, McTiernan would eventually be brought back to direct the third installment in the series, Die Hard With A Vengeance. McTiernan is a very good at directing when it comes to action movies, although he has made some bad ones (Rollerball is a prime example of that.

Die Hard is definitely a must see for your movie education, as you will be seeing an action movie like no other, an action movie that puts less emphasis on immortality and more emphasis on realism. And not to mention that this is also a movie that you are probably going to be finding yourself watching over and over again, as it's truly is that great.

William Atherton gives a somewhat comical performance as Richard Thornburg, a reporter who ends up getting on the wrong side of McClane's wife (and it shows in the sequel to this movie, by the way).And like I mentioned, John McClane is different from your usual action hero. McClane is depicted as being a hero that's not a glory seeker and invincible, but as being reluctant and vulnerable. There are several instances in this movie in which he takes a serious beating, such as there's a scene where some glass gets shot up, and he's not wearing any shoes, and his feet end up getting badly cut. It's not often that we get a vulnerable hero like that, but at the same time, it's very good, because not only is it different from the ones that we see so often, but it also adds some realism to it.John McTiernan helms the director's reins, and he does an absolutely superb job as far as his directing is concerned. McTiernan gives this movie an edge that contains skill and energy, which really helps escalate this movie to the level of a masterpiece. As a matter of fact, McTiernan would eventually be brought back to direct the third installment in the series, Die Hard With A Vengeance. McTiernan is a very good at directing when it comes to action movies, although he has made some bad ones (Rollerball is a prime example of that. Anyway, he did fabulous work on this film.The bottom line, is that Die Hard is without a doubt one of the greatest action movies of all time, and one of the most realistic ones as well. Die Hard is definitely a must see for your movie education, as you will be seeing an action movie like no other, an action movie that puts less emphasis on immortality and more emphasis on realism. And not to mention that this is also a movie that you are probably going to be finding yourself watching over and over again, as it's truly is that great. Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present to you a classic that is here to say for all time, Die Hard.10\/10 ","genre":"Action, Thriller"},{"date":"31 December 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Cinderella is among my wife's favorite Disney films and there is a lot to like about it.

Vacation is the latest one I've seen, featuring a parody of Disney World (Walley World) and a jerky but well-meaning man trying his best to drive his family across the country. Unfortunately they automatically fall into misfortune; their poor reliable old car is traded in to a sleazy dealership for a newer model and squashed flat, and the dealership sells them an inferior pea-green station wagon (not at all what they ordered). They make a pit stop at their redneck cousins' place, where a misfit family of hillbillies and farmers introduce Audrey Griswold to some rather disturbing lifestyles... Audrey is given a purse of weed and rolled joints from her cousin and learns about the family's inbreeding, and the Griswold family gets the surprise (and unwanted task) of driving their crabby old aunt Edna and her nasty dog with them in the backseat to be dropped off in Phoenix. As things usually go for the Griswold family, their bad luck can only get worse, providing a load of entertainment through the whole movie.My question is, what happened to movies like this? Vacation is a genuinely funny and entertaining movie. Most movies like this today are full of gross sex jokes and fart jokes (R.V. from 2006 for example). The families in movies today are silly, lazy and clones of everything trendy right now, leaving them hard to relate to, and the soundtrack for them is terrible. Vacation has very few sex jokes (the ones it does have are very subtle), no fart jokes, some swearing, but nothing that would take away from enjoying the movie the way movies today have become. The soundtrack to Vacation is so catchy and nostalgic (I wish music was as good today as t was back then), the family is just your average middle-class family, easy to relate to, and the acting was excellent (they even got John Candy to play a small role as the overweight security guard). Unlike most movies today, which rely on fart jokes to get laughs from their audiences, Vacation improvises with various antics that could happen to any family. If a time machine was invented right now, I'd gladly pack my bags and go straight to 1983 to avoid the stupidity of society today.Sometimes you just want a simple, hilarious, entertaining little movie to watch at any time of the year and Vacation definitely fits the profile. Watching it is like living through your old family home videos and Super-8 recordings (or camcorder videos if you grew up in a later time, although I was born in the Nineties my family always used older home video equipment).

When I was young I generally liked Bond movies for the action sequences but now I'm more likely to ask the question - who wouldn't want to be a secret agent stationed in Nassau? Even by my rather conservative tastes I have to admit that the Bahamas would be a pretty fine place to spend some time. Oh and save the world in the meantime. You see Bond gets to do all the fun touristy bits - scuba dive, make love to beautiful women, eat caviar, drink Don Peregnion '55 whilst saving thousands of lives at the same time and we love him for it! We don't start off in the Caribbean as we have an original pre-title sequence (bizarre in some ways but 100% Bond) and then a long first act at Shrublands, a health clinic where Bond is recuperating with the help of a pretty nurse, which just happens to be conveniently located near to an RAF base...... In this rather sanitized environment of all places Bond stumbles on something, but he's not entirely sure what, which is no surprise as this is about the most densely conceived plot of any Bond movie, implausible probably, but easily believable enough for a Bond movie thank you. It's also nice that the plot isn't over-explained too much as the movie flows, you may need to watch it more than once to get it all, which is fine. Connery clearly owned the role of Bond by this point, remember that Ian Fleming had initially been against him playing the character but by the time he died in 1964, he thought Connery was the consummate Bond. His concept of Bond as an upper class daredevil now seems quaint but Connery brought a convincing hard edge underneath the sophisticated manners and palette. Here he seems to be at the point of playing Bond like it's the most natural thing in the world without sleep-walking through the role as he would later. A Bond film needs more than the man himself though and preferably a good baddie. What's great here is that we actually have two. Emilio Largo oozes savagery - surely a shark loving, eye-patch wearing mastermind should choose a better disguise, but hey it's a Bond movie! - and Fiona Volpe might be the best female antagonist Bond has ever had (either her or Rosa Klebb, that would be a fight worth seeing). She is in some ways a female equivalent of Bond, cool, sexy and a very capable killer, she's just chosen the other side of the law to live on. And just as happy as Bond to use sex as she needs to. Ruthless and highly strung it's a mystery why she wasn't more of an inspiration for later female characters in the series, rather than the plastic dollies we ended up with. In all honesty she's more interesting that nominal 'Bond Girl' Domino, played by former Miss France Claudine Auger, who's perhaps a little bland but also beautiful and sympathetic. In quite a large supporting cast Bond's assistant Paula and Largo's curious henchman Vargas, who does not drink smoke or make love, are worth noting too. The film contains many of the series' most memorable set pieces, be it jet pack clad Bond, the tense Spectre meeting room complete with electric chairs, the impossibly grand, seemingly enormous MI6 conference room, the landing of a Tornado in the middle of the Sea, Bond's escape from Largo's shark tank and his cat and mouse games with Fiona, from a surprisingly tense 100 mph car ride through to the dance at the Kiss Kiss club during the Jamboree. Most memorable of all perhaps is the exquisite photography of the Bahamas, much of it shot underwater, quite a feat in 1965 as Q would have you know. Therein however is the film's main weakness and why it doesn't quite manage full marks. Whilst some of the underwater scenes are very good and in the case of Bond and Domino remarkably sexy, the ending fight sequence doesn't work perfectly, going on for too long and being rather ambiguous. Sharper editing and more clarity would have helped. Having worked so hard for the first two thirds of the film to create the most tense situation imaginable, the final act doesn't really deliver as you'd hope and is actually less suspenseful than many of the (much derided) ticking bomb climaxes of other Bonds. The increasing focus on high tech gadgetry at this point in the series, with each item by coincidence helping Bond escape from a particular situation pushes things a little as well though not as much as with later Bondage. So all in all it's not quite as flawless as the previous year's Goldfinger but Thunderball perhaps gets unfairly maligned as the point when the Bond series started going downhill.

You see Bond gets to do all the fun touristy bits - scuba dive, make love to beautiful women, eat caviar, drink Don Peregnion '55 whilst saving thousands of lives at the same time and we love him for it! We don't start off in the Caribbean as we have an original pre-title sequence (bizarre in some ways but 100% Bond) and then a long first act at Shrublands, a health clinic where Bond is recuperating with the help of a pretty nurse, which just happens to be conveniently located near to an RAF base...... In this rather sanitized environment of all places Bond stumbles on something, but he's not entirely sure what, which is no surprise as this is about the most densely conceived plot of any Bond movie, implausible probably, but easily believable enough for a Bond movie thank you. It's also nice that the plot isn't over-explained too much as the movie flows, you may need to watch it more than once to get it all, which is fine. Connery clearly owned the role of Bond by this point, remember that Ian Fleming had initially been against him playing the character but by the time he died in 1964, he thought Connery was the consummate Bond. His concept of Bond as an upper class daredevil now seems quaint but Connery brought a convincing hard edge underneath the sophisticated manners and palette. Here he seems to be at the point of playing Bond like it's the most natural thing in the world without sleep-walking through the role as he would later. A Bond film needs more than the man himself though and preferably a good baddie. What's great here is that we actually have two. Emilio Largo oozes savagery - surely a shark loving, eye-patch wearing mastermind should choose a better disguise, but hey it's a Bond movie! - and Fiona Volpe might be the best female antagonist Bond has ever had (either her or Rosa Klebb, that would be a fight worth seeing). She is in some ways a female equivalent of Bond, cool, sexy and a very capable killer, she's just chosen the other side of the law to live on. And just as happy as Bond to use sex as she needs to. Ruthless and highly strung it's a mystery why she wasn't more of an inspiration for later female characters in the series, rather than the plastic dollies we ended up with. In all honesty she's more interesting that nominal 'Bond Girl' Domino, played by former Miss France Claudine Auger, who's perhaps a little bland but also beautiful and sympathetic. In quite a large supporting cast Bond's assistant Paula and Largo's curious henchman Vargas, who does not drink smoke or make love, are worth noting too. The film contains many of the series' most memorable set pieces, be it jet pack clad Bond, the tense Spectre meeting room complete with electric chairs, the impossibly grand, seemingly enormous MI6 conference room, the landing of a Tornado in the middle of the Sea, Bond's escape from Largo's shark tank and his cat and mouse games with Fiona, from a surprisingly tense 100 mph car ride through to the dance at the Kiss Kiss club during the Jamboree. Most memorable of all perhaps is the exquisite photography of the Bahamas, much of it shot underwater, quite a feat in 1965 as Q would have you know. Therein however is the film's main weakness and why it doesn't quite manage full marks. Whilst some of the underwater scenes are very good and in the case of Bond and Domino remarkably sexy, the ending fight sequence doesn't work perfectly, going on for too long and being rather ambiguous. Sharper editing and more clarity would have helped. Having worked so hard for the first two thirds of the film to create the most tense situation imaginable, the final act doesn't really deliver as you'd hope and is actually less suspenseful than many of the (much derided) ticking bomb climaxes of other Bonds. The increasing focus on high tech gadgetry at this point in the series, with each item by coincidence helping Bond escape from a particular situation pushes things a little as well though not as much as with later Bondage. So all in all it's not quite as flawless as the previous year's Goldfinger but Thunderball perhaps gets unfairly maligned as the point when the Bond series started going downhill. In fairness it represents one last hurrah before Bond became generic.

The movie opens up with a young orphan girl named Penny who is kidnapped by an evil woman who owns a pawn shop called Madame Medusa(who looks like a cross between Bette Midler and Bernadette Peters for some strange reason)who wants Penny to get the devils eye(which is a diamond that is somewhere in a cave).So Penny writes a letter and puts it in a bottle and throws it in the swamp. Meanwhile a mouse finds the message in the bottle from Penny and the film starts. We are later introduced to two mice called Bernard(voiced by Bob Newman)and Bianca(voiced by Eva Gabor who also provides the voice for Duchess the cat in The Aristocrats)who are in the rescuers red society which is a group of mice who are like private eye detectives who rescue people that are in trouble. So Bernard and Bianca are set off to find Penny and bring her back home. They meet some interesting charcthers along the way of their journey to find the little girl.Overall I have never seen this film before and I saw it with a blind eye,so I din't know what to make of it first,but to be quite frank I actually thought it was entertaining and cute. Also here is some trivia for ya Don Bluth and of course Richard Rich(who directed one of my all time favourite animated movies that is not from Disney The Swan Princess) both worked on this movie together,before they left Disney and started THERE own business against Disney Animation which is NO MORE. The film is extremely underrated and it reminded me of Basil Mouse Detective as I saw bits and pieces of that film.Overall if you love animal movies then this one isn't all that bad its cute and suitable for 6 years up. 6.1\/10Out of 5 I give it a *** out of *****.

However, I liked the decision for Paramount to have some cameos from the likes of Florence Henderson and the late Ann B. Davis. The film is a bit campy at time, but it takes some getting used to. The jokes are really good, but the main joke is seeing how the Bradys react in the 1990's, and fortunately that joke did not disappoint.Betty Thomas's film has all the original characters from the television series, including my favorite Alice the housekeeper. A scheming neighbor of the Bradys plan to take their house unless they can raise twenty thousand dollars. They discover that participating in a musical may be their only bet to keep their property.The film was not badly acted. The new actors retained enough of the characters wit to be effective. Shelley Long and Gary Cole as the parents were very good. Christine Taylor as the eldest daughter, Marcia is also very good and beautiful! Michael McKean is effective as the scheming neighbor. Finally, Henriette Mantel as Alice actually reminded me of Ann B.

The movie often movies into slapstick territory and relies on physical comedy perhaps a bit too much, but that doesn't hurt the film too much. Nothing beats the original Brady family, but this Brady family was very good and quite funny. This is the story of how 1970 met 1995 to pretty funny results. I rate this film 9\/10.
