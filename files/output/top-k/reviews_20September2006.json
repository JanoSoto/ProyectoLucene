In the1970s, he admitted himself to the mental ward. There he realizes that the staff members and doctors are cold towards the patients. After helping his roommate, he wants to help people and really listen to them. Patch sees humor as the best medicine for the patients. After he left the mental ward, he attends the Virginia Medical University. While studying to be a doctor, he daily visits the patients in the hospital. He would stop at nothing to make the patients laugh, even if his career was at risk. Dean Walcott (Bob Guton) sticks to the rules when he forbids Patch to be anywhere near the patients until his third year. He continues to help people by founding the Gesundheit Clinic. There Patch and his friends, Truman (Daniel London) and Corrine (Monica Potter), helped people without insurance or payments. Unfortunately, Patch has to face the Medical Review Board because he was practicing medicine without a license. The movie is based on a true story of a man who wanted to help people by using his hilarious personality as the medicine.Patch Adams is a movie which shows the audience the doctors prospective of medical practice. It makes a good point that even though their jobs are stressful, they need to treat the patient, not just the diseases. For example, instead of referring to the patient as the cancer patient in room 306, Patch suggests that the doctors should refer to them by their name. While preventing death is a big part of the doctor's job, they also should improve the quality of life.This 1998 movie is an inspirational story and leaves the viewers with motivation to help others. While having comedy through out the movie, there is also drama. The director did a good job of connecting the beginning and the end together. Patch finally found what he was good at, patching things up.

Kevin Costner does a fine turn as Elliot Ness the man who would hunt down and take down Al Capone's empire. Kevin Costner does the role of his life in this and the only other thing by him that even comes close to this is The Postman. Sean Connery does good in this as an Irish cop who is trying to redeem himself. I believe that this is and was the turning point in Connery's career. Before this he was seen as a has been and had been type cast as James Bond, but this broke him out of that rut by showing that he had range. Charles Martin Smith is funny in this as he is in almost all of his movies. Can't wait to see him do something big again. Andy Garcia makes an early appearance in this as well and it helps the film as he is a good actor. But the real saving grace of this is Robert De Neiro. This is his forth collaboration with director Brian De Palma and it is probably their best effort together. Although I like Greetings a lot. Brian De Palma finally gets out of a tough patch that he was in and makes another masterpiece. This is easily one of my top five favorites from De Palma. Watch this.

Her bosses at the FBI aren't happy & decide to make her disappear by putting her back on the Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) case as he is still a wanted man. The FBI has recently received new information from Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), a child abuser & Lecter's 4th victim whom he cut the face off & fed to his dog. Now horribly disfigured Verger thinks of nothing but revenge & provides Clarice with information that leads to Florence where Italian police inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) has discovered that Dr. Fell an arts academic is in fact the notorious cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter. However instead of going to the FBI Pazzi decides to sell the information to Verger, Lecter soon finds himself on the run from Mason's men, the FBI & several large flesh eating pigs...This English American co-production was directed by Ridley Scott who, to some extent, had the almost impossible & thankless task of making a sequel to the multi Oscar winning hugely successful horror\/thriller The Silence of the Lambs (1991) which I myself thought was a great film. Persoanlly I actually think Hannibal is a better, more entertaining film that I would rather watch than the slightly overrated original. The script by David Mamet & Steven Zaillian was again based on a novel by Thomas Harris & is a different sort of film to the original with enough variation to stand on it's own, it moves along at a fair pace although there are a few slow patches here & there. While watching Hannibal I was thinking beauty & the beast, it uses elegant classical music & features the beautiful Italian city of Florence along with it's impressive architecture. While at the same time Hannibal also features plenty of nastiness, spilled guts, cannibalism, corruption, greed, murder & betrayal. I thought it made for an excellent & interesting contrast & I thought it worked extremely well. Most of the character's in Hannibal come across as bad guys although the central figure of Hannibal is as fascinating & alluring as ever, even though he's a ruthless cannibalistic killer you like him, I'm not sure why but it's true.Director Scott does a great job & that divide between the exquisite & the sleaze creates a good atmosphere, the film is fantastically shot & has lots of style. There are numerous great scenes here, from killer pigs to the infamous dinner at the end. The special effects are very good & I honestly didn't recognise Oldman under all that make-up. There's some decent gore here & it's maybe a little gory for the average viewer, there's slit throats, stabbings, shootings, cannibalism & 'that' scene at the end that freaks everyone I know out even if I mention it!With a supposed budget of about $87,000,000 Hannibal is extremely well made although I have to say I was very surprised to learn that it cost that much although it is suggested that there's at least another hour of footage that was cut from the final version so maybe some of those $'s ended up on the cutting room floor. The acting is great, Hopkins as Hannibal is class, Moore does OK as Starling & fills Jodie Foster's shoes well enough.Hannibal is a good film, no actually it's a very good film & I think it's a more entertaining film than the original. Despite it's slightly overlong running time & the odd dull patch I liked it, it's as simple & straight forward as that. A sequel Young Hannibal Behind the Mask (2007) is a prequel that features Hannibal Lecter as a teenager so no Anthony Hopkins...
