[{"date":"17 May 2011","score":"","review":" Let me say that if you're not in tune with this movie, you're going to hate it.It tells the story of a group of super-heroes (in a world where some individuals are blessed with super-powers) whose powers are, to put it generously, extraordinarily lame. Fortunately, even though they do their best to help by banding together, their help is not needed because their city has a resident super-hero. Less fortunately, due to a mishap at their hands, he dies, and they have to come into their own to fight a super-villain.This delightfully loopy movie is blessed with a first rate cast. They play the material absolutely straight, and the movie is all the better for that (insofar as you can play straight the idea of someone who can turn invisible, but only when no-one is looking).I don't like the expression to get something. Nonetheless, I think it fits here - if you get Mystery Men, then you'll love it and, if you don't, you won't.
