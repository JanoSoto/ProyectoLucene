Kubrick's 2001 was one such work, and the Spielberg\/Kubrick meld-piece A.I. Artificial Intelligence is another.Love it or hate it, one cannot simply consign this movie to insignificance. Personally, the movie blew me away.  I actually cried at the end of it, and I haven't cried at a movie in over ten years.  I wholeheartedly disagree with some of the comments I've read about this movie.  I did not think that the ending was simply a tack-on; I thought it was a poignant epilogue that drove home the film's points about the quest for meaning and validation in life.  The entire film, ending and all, had an epic feel much like that of 2001 or even Lawrence of Arabia.I also fail to see how one could accuse Spielberg of not being at all Kubrickian in his direction.  There were plenty of dark, disturbing, and claustrophobic moments that harken back to Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange or The Shining and plenty of visceral, violent moments that smacked of FullMetal Jacket or again A Clockwork Orange.Granted, Spielberg is guilty of some glossing and some manipulation, because of which I give this movie a 9 and not a 10, and he does blatantly steal from his own Close Encounters of the Third Kind at the end, but there was enough profundity and thought-provokingness to the movie that I was able to look past the mild flaws.  A good amount of the material would have raised my give me a break hackles if handled less skillfully, but darn it, I bought it.

Five guys (at least two of them are ex-cons) decide to rob a casino during the Elvis convention in Vegas.  Nothing too high-concept but what did you expect, its an action flick! The rest of the story deals with double-crosses, unwanted baggage, the obligatory police investigation, and many, many bullets.

Its not going to make any top ten lists or sweep the Academy off its collective feet,  but this film wasn't trying to do that.  It does its job, ENTERTAIN! Kurt Russell is great and likeable as our films (anti) hero. (I am a huge Kurt Russell fan though-Jack Burton...ME!)  But the real surprise is Kevin Costner's role as the film's bad guy.  I put that in quotes because although you hate his character, you gotta love the fact that he plays an excellent nut-job! A HUGE departure for him.  Besides Courtney Cox-Arquette and the young man who portays her son (with a potentially bright future I might add), the rest of the very cool supporting cast doesn't get much screen time. The soundtrack is SPECTACULAR! Bands like Filter( scorpion battle credit sequence), SpineShank, and hed(pe) (ending shootout) accompany the mandatory Elvis tunes as well as others.  Paced well and conveys the feel needed for each particular scene the songs are used in. (P.S  Closing credit sequence is very cool...you'll see) Which brings me to the Scorpion Battle.  I see a lot of people labeling it as unnecessary.  I have one thing to say to all of you  You're correct! But it is very cool, gets you pumped, and does have significance. Let us assume the black scorpion is Kurt and the silver Kevin.  Just notice how the silver scorpion is killed.  With his own stinger being used by the black one right?!  Okay, flash forward to the end where Mr. Costner is stung by the black scorpion.   He is stung on his scorpion tattoo, right? Notice where.  Right in the middle of its stinger.  Not exactly sure what it means, but the filmmakers made it obvious where the blood was coming from to a such a degree that it has some meaning. Perhaps killed by his own aggressive behavior...I don't know and I'm not going to ponder over it any deeper.This is a guy flick through and through (although my wife enjoyed it) and there are moments to be liked.

Unfortunately, it's not very funny, despite some big laughs in certain spots.  For the most part, this is a time waster, and while I've seen worse, it's not worth your hard-earned money unless you really, really hate Scream or just absolutely love sexual jokes.I don't think there's a real reason to go over the story, since it's essentially Scream added with individual scenes from other horror films. The movie starts out fairly well, actually.  Carmen Electra is the movie's opening victim, and she has a lot of fun playing the part.  I particularly enjoyed her response to what she thought was the scariest she'd ever seen. After this opening scene, there are some more laughs to be had, but it grows more tiresome as it moves along, which can't be a good thing when you consider the fact the film's only 88 minutes long.There are a lot of movies spoofed here, some work much better than others. The Wayan Brothers need to know what films to let well enough alone, such as The Matrix.  Seeing a normal teen kick ass like Carrie Ann-Moss might be funny to some, but not to me. I mean, for crying out loud, we have a movie that parodies parts of that film, it's called Battlefield Earth (and it was a lot funnier in that movie).  The only non-horror film that's parodied that works here is probably with Amistad, and it only worked because the filmmakers were African-American.But, I think, overall the real problem is the over-reliance on crude sexual jokes.

It's hard to believe these moments were sacrificed for so many jokes on penis size and gay-related humor, most of which almost completely fall flat.  In my opinion, I believe the main reason the Wayans brother included so many unbelievably graphic and crude sex jokes was to make it more memorable, even if its in a notorious manner.  After all, everybody I've spoken to about this film always bring up those jokes first.The movie stars a couple of the Wayans brothers, who are most definitely energetic but hardly consistently funny.  Jon Abrahams gets off a couple of good laughs and I must say I could not recognize Shannon Elizabeth from American Pie; she just looks so...goofy in this movie.  Anna Faris undeniably has the most fun, and while she's certainly not a great actress she fits in perfectly here.This was followed by the even moreso unimaginatively titled Scary Movie 2, which I have yet to see, but have heard that it makes the original look good in comparison.

Anna Faris undeniably has the most fun, and while she's certainly not a great actress she fits in perfectly here.This was followed by the even moreso unimaginatively titled Scary Movie 2, which I have yet to see, but have heard that it makes the original look good in comparison.  I don't know about you, but when it comes to movies, there's nothing more painful than watching a bad comedy that thinks it's so hilarious.  ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"9 August 2001","score":"","review":"  * 1\/2 out of ****Scary Movie is, of course, the parody to Wes Craven's immensely popular Scream.  I've never been a huge fan of Scream so I was actually looking forward to a film that would be poking fun at it, as well as countless other films in the genre.  Unfortunately, it's not very funny, despite some big laughs in certain spots.  For the most part, this is a time waster, and while I've seen worse, it's not worth your hard-earned money unless you really, really hate Scream or just absolutely love sexual jokes.I don't think there's a real reason to go over the story, since it's essentially Scream added with individual scenes from other horror films. The movie starts out fairly well, actually.  Carmen Electra is the movie's opening victim, and she has a lot of fun playing the part.  I particularly enjoyed her response to what she thought was the scariest she'd ever seen. After this opening scene, there are some more laughs to be had, but it grows more tiresome as it moves along, which can't be a good thing when you consider the fact the film's only 88 minutes long.There are a lot of movies spoofed here, some work much better than others. The Wayan Brothers need to know what films to let well enough alone, such as The Matrix.  Seeing a normal teen kick ass like Carrie Ann-Moss might be funny to some, but not to me. I mean, for crying out loud, we have a movie that parodies parts of that film, it's called Battlefield Earth (and it was a lot funnier in that movie).  The only non-horror film that's parodied that works here is probably with Amistad, and it only worked because the filmmakers were African-American.But, I think, overall the real problem is the over-reliance on crude sexual jokes.  I mean, it might just be me, but I paid to watch a movie that parodied the horror genre.  What I got was a movie that spent 65% of its time thinking that sex jokes are the most brilliant form of humor around. Hell, it even seems like the Wayans Brothers forgot they were parodying horror flicks up until the finale.  Do these guys really think it's funny to see a man get stabbed with a penis?Some of the funniest parts feature the killer running around, acting like an incompetent dolt.  It's hard to believe these moments were sacrificed for so many jokes on penis size and gay-related humor, most of which almost completely fall flat.  In my opinion, I believe the main reason the Wayans brother included so many unbelievably graphic and crude sex jokes was to make it more memorable, even if its in a notorious manner.
