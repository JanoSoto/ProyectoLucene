Needless to say, the first two times I viewed this movie, I was somewhat impressed with Eddie Murphy playing a total of seven characters in one movie.  After watching this movie a third time- this time alone- I've concluded that Eddie Murphy is not just an actor, but an excellent one.  This time I watched him BECOME the characters; interpret the characters; live the characters.  The voices, the behavior, the physical demeanor, the reactions and counter-reactions and the emotions were developed in each character as if each Klump, including Buddy Love and Lance Perkins were played by individual actors- not one single actor.  I now have a true admiration for Eddie Murphy the actor that I've never had before.  His characterization of Professor Klump was excellent.  Watch his facial expressions in each scene.  And, oddly enough, the one character that was a total turn off to me was Buddy Love.  I realize now that Buddy Love's obnoxious behavior was intended to be repulsive.   When you couple the characters portrayed by Eddie Murphy with the script and supporting actors- who all played admirably- you come away with a hit movie.  I think this is a flattering remake of the Jerry Lewis original and I encourage you to view Lewis' version also. For those who are reading this review, if you watched this movie once and didn't like it, watch it again and put yourself in the shoes of Eddie Murphy the actor.  It's similar to sliding a size eight into a size twenty shoe.

When I first saw this film in the theater, it was a bit of a let-down, coming on the heels of the brilliant _Fargo_ (one of the greatest American films of the last 20 years, and that's no understatement).  But when I first rented it on home video, I was sucked in by the charm and the atmosphere of the film. It has such a laid-back, easygoing style that I can see how it might not appeal to those looking for nonstop action.  But if you're willing to surrender to the peculiar charms of this film, you too might begin to see it for the work of genius it is.  I've since purchased the film on video and have watched it several more times--it really is a film that grows on you and it is hilarious to boot.  John Goodman has never been better than in the role of the insufferable Walter, who knows everything and will never admit he's wrong, even when he clearly is.  But he's a true friend to the Dude, played by Jeff Bridges, and Donny, played by Steve Buscemi.  The three of them are bowling buddies, and in the course of preparing for the big tournament, they get pulled into a weird little mixup involving a carpet, a wayward wife, and the Big Lebowski, who just happens to have the same name as Bridge's character.I've seen this described elsewhere as a sort of anti-mystery and that's one way of enjoying it.  Imagine Jeff Bridges as a sort of stoned, clueless Philip Marlowe, stumbling through his investigation.  The comedy though is just so relaxed and unforced, unlike that in the Coens' _Raising Arizona_, a film I've never been able to watch.  The acting in this film is amazing, with a cast of independent film allstars.  The more I think about it, the more I wonder if this film might not be just that much better than _Fargo_.  If not, it's a very close second.  If you rent the film and it doesn't appeal to you at first, give it a chance--you might find that it grows on you, too.

It has a very engaging story and it is very well acted and directed, but it was also heavily influenced by Hollywood. Normally, the effects of Hollywood are not inherently damaging to movies in general (although they rarely add to a film's cinematic value), but in the case of a period film like The Patriot, it is best to avoid the influences of Hollywood. The first problem that is presented is the fact that a Hollywood Movie is NEVER compatible with real life. The real world is just not the same as the world that is presented in the movies, and the Patriot attempted to tell a bit of real history, the same way that Braveheart did. Even though the film was historically accurate to a certain extent, many of the battles were either blended together or completely fabricated, and the events that took place in those battles are, in many cases, clearly manipulated. I believe one of the ending scenes, involving Benjamin Martin (Gibson) and Charles Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson), provides a good example. And Mel Gibson played EXACTLY the same role that he played in Braveheart!! He was the average guy who suffered an unimaginable loss to the sheer brutality of the 'enemy,' and decides to take it upon himself to take the enemy out. He is such a spectacular warrior that he is able to kill dozens of men single-handedly, and the enemy is so shocked that they think he is a ghost. Wasn't that exact line in Braveheart somewhere? I have to admit that it was a lot of fun to watch those battle scenes, but the lack of originality is something that I absolutely have to complain about.Besides that, the film also attempted to address certain issues in history, but these attempts were clearly very weak. They wanted to address the slavery issue, so they had a slave in the movie who is fighting in order to earn his freedom, but winds up fighting alongside the other white soldiers even though the necessary time to earn his freedom has passed. This is a very noble thing to do, and it was very inspiring to watch, but then you realize that this was the only black man in the entire film. That is a very small effort to put towards addressing such an enormous issue, especially in American history. Furthermore, the very end of the film (possible spoilers ahead), while uplifting and much easier to watch than the ending to Braveheart, was obviously meant to manipulate the audience's emotions. I don't like to have my emotions manipulated like that, even if it IS nice to see a happily ever after ending. Everything was finally coming together for everyone in the movie, including the solitary slave, who apparently found the perfect white man to spend his freedom working for. It's ironic that when everything works out perfectly in a movie, it ends up being more disappointing than a film that has a tragic ending, like Braveheart did. I think that this is a pattern that can be seen most in war films, because the target audience for war films likes to see what really happened. They don't want a nice flowery ending, they don't want anything sugar coated to make it easier to watch, they want the history books acted out on film. This led to the success of films like Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan, All Quiet on the Western Front, Full Metal Jacket, etc. When the facts are altered in any way, it immediately lessens the impact of the film. Despite all of my complaints, I do acknowledge that The Patriot was an amazing film, and it was extremely well made, with even a bit of good comic relief included (comic relief is almost required in war films, in my opinion). It is something that should be watched by anyone who even remotely enjoys war films or even just period films.

Stay away from this movie, it´s real bad !I never thought a big action blockbuster, coming out of  Hollywood, could be like this. This movie is BORING ! It was the worst action movie i ever saw. I wasn´t expecting much out of it, but i sure wasn´t expecting it to be BORING ! What´s wrong with this movie ?!It´s totaly uninteresting. The plot was already done a million times, and it seemed more like a rejected draft script from a James Bond movie than actualy a finished work. And the latest 007, was also a boring empty shell, but not as much as MI-2 is. This is almost unbelievable ! It begun pretty bad, with the usual classical car duel, between the hero and the movie babe. Everything was in place as usual, including the hanging above the abyss, race outcome, seen a million times in all the 007. And the initial seduction scenes, oh well... The villains are nothing more than a collection of clichés from James Bond, only this time, without any charisma or interest whatsoever, ruing all the threat. The bad guys are just there to loose, and that´s clear right from the begining. Even if it wasn´t, Tom Cruise´s character is so undestructible, that ruins any chance of suspence. There´s never a moment in this movie, where we feel Ethan Hunt is in danger. We already know that he´s going to make it out alive ,in a very cool and spectacular way. The audience just waits for the next spectacular scene to happen. And i loved the way, the bad guys waited for him to put his shades on, before they start shooting, after all, after MATRIX, what the public wants is to see coolness. New action heroes don´t even have to be brave, just be cool. And by the way, how come this movie looks like a fashion-world commercial most of the time ?! In some scenes i was even expecting to see a shampoo Logo right across the screen. It´s hilarious !The suspence scenes had no suspence. That one in the race track was already done everywhere else. The shooting action scenes were empty and impersonal, with lots of bullets flying through the air, with bad guys shooting security guards and Tom Cruise shooting anywhere. And all this filmed in such a politically correct way that it made everything look phoney. All this amount of action, which was only spectacular and nothing else, reminded me of a big budget episode of The A-TEAM. Lots of shooting but no blood , or realistic killing scenes. While at the same time it pretends to be a very serious spy thriller. . This is the type of movie that gives children the idea that shooting people doesn´t hurt. And this gets even more dangerous because this movie was trimmed to be so politicaly correct, to aim at that particular audience. The only audiences that are going to take something out of it, are the young audiences of millions of early teens or more physically mature but braindead popcorn eaters,  who are going to think this is a great movie because of the cars, the bikes, and because it looks cool.This movie gets so boring, that it even repeats the same scene with Tom Cruise hanging from cables like in the first episode. We can see this is going to be a trade mark, and i can´t wait to see where they are going to do it next time. The scenes where there is no action are boring, because the characters are just made of plastic. That so-called love story, gets ridiculous, because it´s just there as a set up for something we know it´s going to happen later, and it´s never credible. Anyway all this gets totally redundant, because despite the outcome of the love story, we can already guess, that the girl is going to get killed right at the beginning of MI-3, because Tom Cruise is going to need another Bond Gir..., sorry girlfriend next time. So who cares !The secondary good guy characters do nothing on this movie, and are there just to make Tom Cruise look good, wich is a shame because they could have been great characters, if this MI had kept the team spirit of the original series, instead of becoming a new super hero movie. By the way, if you liked Thandie Newton, who plays the girl, check the movie BELOVED, where you can really see what a fantastic actress she is. There is nothing wrong with the actors on MI-2, the only problem is that they are all limited by this screenplay for children. But Tom Cruise must have had plenty of fun.And if you want to go see this movie, because you´re a John Woo fan, forget it. This isn´t a John Woo movie. It´s just a movie he was hired to do. What´s left here is a strange mix between something that sometimes wants to be a John Woo film, but never allowed and some shampoo commercial.A terrible, terrible movie. The only thing good about it, are the masks. Which i´m sure John Woo must be wearing one right now, hoping his fans won´t hit him to much for creating such a Hollywood product.If you want to see a great american John Woo, see FACE OFF instead.

While I admit that this film had a few good points, it seemed to have more bad points.My main complaint is how completely formulatic this film is.  As the astronauts entered their shuttle and gave a glance to the crowd, I leaned over to my friend and remarked, `Gee, I wonder which of these guys isn't coming back.'  It's completely obvious.  I wish the screenwriters had at least attempted to break the mold here and throw a few surprises at us.  I must give a little credit to Clint Eastwood as the director, however. There is an interesting effect in the opening sequences in which he uses voice-overs to convince the audience that the young pilots are the same characters as the old ones.  While this is a good attempt, it just doesn't work.  Tommy Lee Jones' young character was particularly laughable. but nice try, guys.  I think they must have realized that it wasn't really going to work, because they made every attempt they could to cover the mouths of all the actors.Secondly, it seems like a lot of elements were just glossed over.  For example, we don't really spend any time with the main character's wife. We meet her in the beginning, but then we don't see her again until the launch (during which she never says a word).  It would have been interesting to know what she thinks about the mission.  Is she excited for her husband? Is she nervous?  How did he break the news to her?  Does she not want him to go?  Additionally, when a main character sacrifices himself, the film doesn't spend much time on his departure.  At least the movie didn't create a typically sappy `goodbye' scene, but in a sharp contrast, the scene seems rather rushed.  In fact, the whole space section of the film is rather rushed.  And in the end, what happens to the `villains' of the film?  Are they punished?  Are they even exposed?  There's no real pay-off there. (As a side note, why, WHY are NASA and air force guys always chewing gum in films?)Final complaint, I promise.  Why does Hollywood insist on bending the laws of physics and creating sound in space?  Can't they find a creative way to deal with this?  Let us concentrate on the silence of space for a change or allow us to listen to the film's score.  With a film like Star Wars, sound in space is forgivable because the story is a fantasy.  Here, we have a film that pretends to be based around scientific facts.Donald Sutherland does an excellent job, thanks to his fine acting skills and the humorous dialogue in the script.  There are some genuinely smart, funny moments in the film, but I'm afraid it just doesn't make a good film. I suppose the purpose was to create just a fun, entertaining film without anything substance.  If you like those kinds of films, you'll probably really like this one.  I haven't seen Armageddon, but if people consider this film to be significantly better, then I must NEVER see Armageddon!

This was her first big comedy and she's terrific in it. Goldberg stars as Terry Doolittle, a computer operator at a New York bank. At the end of a long day of work, she gets an awkward message from a British spy who's in trouble. As a result she gets plunged into a world of international intrigue and danger. Sure the premise of Jumpin' Jack Flash is silly. But it's an entertaining movie, thanks to Goldberg's performance. She's the whole show here. One of the best moments in the film is the one when the spy asks her to sing with me and find the key, and she listens to the lyrics of the Mick Jagger song Jumpin' Jack Flash so she can find the word or words to crack the spy's code. This scene is a classic. Just get a load of the way Goldberg acts in this scene. It's hilarious. This scene proves that Goldberg is a great comic actress. There's also the scene where, after almost getting killed, Goldberg confronts a police detective played by Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride director Garry Marshall (who oddly enough is the brother of the director of this film, former Laverne & Shirley star Penny Marshall making her directorial debut here). Get a load of the foul language displayed by Goldberg in this scene. I was laughing hysterically out loud. There are also action scenes that really aren't necessary, but they're exciting and thrilling. And there are good supporting performances by Stephen Collins, Carol Kane, John Wood, Annie Potts, Roscoe Lee Browne, Jim Belushi, Jon Lovitz, and the late Phil Hartman. But the real star here is Whoopi. She alone makes Jumpin' Jack Flash worth seeing. And it's far better that Whoopi's next two movies after this Burglar and Fatal Beauty.*** (out of four)  ","genre":null},{"date":"8 August 2000","score":"15 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":"  Jumpin' Jack Flash is a very funny comedy-thriller starring comedienne and current Hollywood Squares star Whoopi Goldberg in the movie she made after her outstanding performance in The Color Purple.

I would have enjoyed this more had the script been stronger (how many times do we need to hear about being a team player before we get the idea?); better dialogue and editing might have made some of the sillier logic gaps easier to swallow.Still, I'll give a round of applause to any movie that showcases the space program and people over 40, and manages to go two hours without injecting sex and violence.
