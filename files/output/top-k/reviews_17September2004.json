The stares of his eyes, silent and long, capture the mind of a self-tormented idealist well. The enigma of this character is intriguing, it will keep you watching, keep you interested. The attention paid to the eyes, to the conception of facial reaction was done exceptionally well in this move. The fury captured in the glares of the final encounter between Peirce and Carlyle will stick out in your mind vividly, the truth of hate is captured in this exchange. This is an unusual action scene, the violence is chaotic and impulsive. It does not appear choreographed and artificial.The conflict between the survival of the body and the nobility of the Christian spirit is embodied throughout the movie in both the dialogue and the plot. The climactic ending is beautiful . . .Guy Pierce's character fines his salvation by resisting the temptations of his body, conveyed by his refusal to engage in cannibalism, instead choosing death. He came to Fort Spencer to escape his past, and in the END, accomplished that through suicidal brilliance.This is a masterpiece, one of my favorite films, Captain Boyd is a character that will never be forgotten. The duality of this character was performed excellently.
