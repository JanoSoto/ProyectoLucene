When watching a film I like to know as early as possible what I am likely to be in for, so I can prepare my mood so I am most likely to enjoy what is in store. This is a film where I struggled. From the opening I was stuck in a peculiar state of purgatory with words and concepts swimming around my head. Is this a musical? Is it a cartoon? Is it horror? Is it something that can just be put under that special label of Tim Burton thought of it. I felt once again like I was being sucked into the old debate of whether a Jaffa Cake is indeed a cake or a biscuit. The one thing I am certain of is that it was visually stunning, and the script and voice acting left little to be desired.The method used to capture the puppets movement and emotions is surprisingly expressive and emotive, while the majority of the songs are infectious and will force you to crack the sort of smile you normally reserve for those precious moments when someone you know well truly surprises you. As is to be expected some of the songs are a little less stand out and detract from the atmosphere slightly, but nothing film breaking. The real stand out character for me was the delightful cameo of the bogeyman, whose appalling yet endearing persona was a treat.Now let's talk about what this film isn't. This isn't a film that you should take too seriously. It is very light on plot and those expecting anything more than the most basic fairytale story will leave bitterly disappointed. It also isn't very long, but this really does work in its favour, leading me nicely onto my closing thoughts.Touching back on my point of classification, this film cannot be classified as it is in defiance of all common genres, but this didn't trouble be at all like I had imagined it would. The short length of the film lends it to have a relentlessly fast pace meaning it has an uncanny knack of holding your attention and keeping you fully immersed. The way it has been shot is so interesting that it matters little that the plot cupboard is bare. The Nightmare before Christmas is a short trip into fantasy land, where the strangest things happen and you are in kept awe almost constantly. Although not without its flaws this is definitely a welcome diversion from most other films developed on this side of the world, reminding us all not to take ourselves too seriously.

She was compelling, she tugged at your heartstrings, and you can't help but cheer for her when she finally stands up to Mr., her husband who had made her life so miserable up to this point. Another performance I very much enjoyed was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia. I was surprised, to say the least, that she could act this well. She was funny, strong, but she was also weak in some respects, like any other person.Now, as with all movies, there were a few things I would have changed. I wished it could have been more like the book, where Celie and Shug Avery are full-on lovers, complete with cheating and reconcile, whereas in the movie, all they have is one little kiss, and after that are only friends! The former, in my opinion, establishes Celie as different from others, and sort of makes her more sympathetic in that respect. Another thing I liked better in the book than the movie was that Mr., AKA Albert, apologizes to Celie for all he's done to her and becomes her friend, sympathizing and trying to help when it is found out that Shug has been unfaithful to her. In the film, this development of his character is present, just not very clear.Even though it has flaws, what movie, no matter how wonderful, doesn't? It's still beautiful, sad, the acting is still top-notch, and I guarantee you, if you don't at least FEEL like crying at the very end, you must have ice-cold water running through your veins.

I'm not a huge Robert E. Howard fan, but I do have some of his stories. I'm mainly interested in his correspondence with Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith. But, even if you have no idea who Howard was, this is still a good little film to check out.It takes place in Texas in the 1930's. A young schoolteacher and budding pulp writer Howard meet and then start dating, sort of. Other than the fact they both love writing, there isn't a whole lot in common between the two. But, they do have chemistry, and the movie has one of the best cinematic kisses I can recall. If you know anything about Howard, you know what will be in this movie. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll not discuss that. But, you do get a glimpse into the world of the man who created Conan(who has a new feature film sans Arnold in the near future) and Solomon Kane(who has a feature film on the cusp of release). Yes, Howard was unusual. Not crazy, but certainly sheltered and depressed, alone and living in his fantasy world.I can't recommend this enough for his fans, writers, etc. Hearing Howard discuss receiving a letter from HP Lovecraft almost made me have to change my drawers. I was so hoping Lovecraft would be in the film, even for 2 minutes, but you will be disappointed if you are looking for him. That is the only scene with anything about him and if you aren't paying attention, you'll miss it. I don't know how long it will take for Hollywood to get its act together to make a good Lovecraft biopic, God knows we need one and there is so much fertile ground in his life that it would trump even this film.Oddly enough, the film references Oliver Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield twice. I happen to be reading the book now, which I thought was an incredibly weird coincidence. I had to cover my ears so none of the plot would be given away, D'oh! Anyway, watch this movie.

He wanted you to think,not to be passive viewers. Scene in the end of movie with Vega (Travolta),Jules (Jackson)and burglars in restaurant is not the end of the story. The end of the story is scene when Butch (Bruce Villis)and his girlfriend leave Los Angeles on a motorcycle. This scene is put almost in the middle of the film. If you are not careful this film can easily delude you. There is a scene when Butch comes to his house to pick up something important to him and finds Vega in his home.He kills Vega,but we see Vega alive and with Jules in last part of movie. How? Because that scene in restaurant happened before scene when Butch comes to his house and finds Vega. Scenes when Vega and Jules come to Marsellus,their boss and Jules says that he is going to quit his job because of all that happened and Butch is seating and talking with Marsellus and scene when Marsellus is chasing Butch on the street and they are shooting at each other,that also happened after scene with robbery in restaurant. Simply,there is no linear story.You have to construct the story from beginning to the end in your head.This is one of many things that make this movie so intelligent and probably the best movie of 1990s,also one of the best films ever made (you can put it on list of 100 best films of all times).Acting and conversations in this film are almost perfect. Every character Vega (Travolta),Jules (Jackson),Marsellus (Wing Rhames), Butch (Villis),Mia (Thurman),Mr.Wolfe (Harvey Keitel),Pumpkin-Ringo (Tim Roth),Captain Koons (Chrisopher Walken),Honey Bunny-Yolanda (Amanda Plummer),Zed (Peter Green) and many others contribute to excellence of all stories in movie. Stories seem to be separated but they are all connected in some way as we see during a film. Soundtrack is furious.Especially opening melody of the movie.Iconic. Also melody in the end is excellent (Surf Rider). Or scene when Vega and Mia dance.Unforgettable.Or scene when Vega comes to Mia in her house and song Son of a preacher man is played. But all of that would mean nothing without enormous creativity and imagination that was used for this film when it was made. This movie is not just an artistic masterpiece, it has a point and message about unbearable lightness of existence. About how cost of negligence could be too high,and why life is something most precious that we have. It also have a dose of black humor and irony of life and death. Almost every scene is put where it belongs,and every conversation has some point.Story about human ego and presumption,about how life can be beautiful and terrible at the same time.And above all of that this film is i repeat my self masterpiece of creativity and imagination. For the end there is one scene when Butch returns to his girlfriend and she asks him where is her car. He answers that he crushed a car but he took a motorcycle.She asks whose motorcycle is that,and he answers that it belongs to Zed. She asks-Who is Zed? He answers-Zed is dead.

Even now that I've seen is several times I'm not 100% sure what is true and what is misdirection.The cast all do a great job, especially Gabriel Byrne as the charismatic ex-corrupt police officer Dean Keaton who is trying to go straight after a life of crime, Pete Postlethwaite as the mysterious Kobayashi and Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint, a crippled con artist who is explaining what happened to the authorities (and us) what may have happened in the run up to his arrest.The film opens in the aftermath of a battle on a boat in a harbour in Los Angeles, there are only two know survivors; Verbal and a badly burnt Hungarian. Dave Kujan, a US customs officer, is sure that Keaton masterminded the attack and has escaped so he interviews Verbal who has done a deal with the police and is soon to be released. Verbal tells a tale of how the group met up when they were all hauled in by the NYPD for a robbery and put in a line up together. There they plan a job to get back at the police before heading to LA to lie low and to fence their ill-gotten gains. Here they are approached by Kobayashi, a lawyer claiming to work for Keyser Soze, a mysterious character who strikes fear into the hearts of criminals even though none have actually met him. Kobayashi explains that they must do one job for Mr Soze. All this is told us by Verbal so we never really know if he is telling the truth, and if he is lying is it to protect himself, his friend Keaton or perhaps he is just making up a story for his own personal amusement while awaiting release.The story is brilliantly told and it is rightly considered a modern classic, if you haven't seen it yet then I strongly recommend watching it... twice!

He lives in a huge house with his family, has been on the cover of various magazines and has numerous endorsement deals. However, unknown to him, he has gotten soft inside the ring to the point where his manager, Mickey (Burgess Meredith) booked him in bouts with inferior fighters. Even getting in the ring with the cocky professional wrestling star, Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan in his acting debut).He lost his edge, and Mickey knew it. However, the champ wouldn't believe it. He even went against Mickey's orders, and accepted the challenge of Clubber Lang (Mr. T in one of his most famous roles), a tough, bad attitude boxer who rapidly reached the Number One Contendership by himself with no trainer helping him out.Mickey warned Balboa not to accept Lang's challenge, but the mohawked fighter verbally went after the champ's wife (Talia Shire) at a public appearance. He immediately accepted the challenge. However, Mickey was proved right, and Balboa lost the title to Lang. And, to make things worse, Mickey suffers a heart attack backstage during a confrontation between Balboa and Lang, and dies in the dressing room as Lang easily defeats the champion for the title.Now, Balboa has to regain what he once had. And he gets help from an old rival (Carl Weathers). A rival who once saw the Eye of the Tiger when he fought The Italian Stallion himself for the title.This is one slow moving movie, especially about half-way through the film. I saw myself looking at websites around that time more than watching the film on On Demand. It does pick up leading up to the rematch between the two boxing rivals around the time Apollo Creed shows up.The acting is near perfect all around. You knew almost immediately when Balboa admits that he lost his edge, by Stallone's performance in the scene, that the death of Mickey affected him deeply. Certain cast members were performing characters who were more important in the previous two movies. I felt that they were there because they somewhat advanced the storyline, or were just there because they have been part of the series since the first movie in the franchise.I liked the chemistry between Stallone and Weathers in this film. In previous films, they were rivals, and now they are on the same side. They acted like two professionals in one of the toughest sports on the planet, one now acting more like a teacher more than a rival who was still annoyed at once losing the title to his now-student. Weathers really shined in this role, making the audience forget how arrogant he was six years before in the first movie.Another breakout performance was that of Mr. T. Surprisingly, as Balboa is getting back his edge, Lang is almost forgotten. The film focuses more on Balboa training for the rematch more than Lang living the life of the defending champion. You almost completely forget he was in the movie until he comes back into the story for the rematch. Personally, I would have liked to have seen some references to Lang as Balboa is in training. This was the role that gave Mr. T his tough guy image. He was the bad guy you wanted to see destroyed.This film is predictable. You know who will win at the end. Personally, I would have liked to have seen some plot twists that would have made the end a little less predictable.Another problem with this film is the soundtrack. I can only remember two songs in the film -- the Rocky Theme piece that is so recognizable now you know immediately where it came from, and Eye of the Tiger by the one-hit-wonder (this song) Survivor.Another problem with this film is, at times, it is hard to understand Stallone's speaking. At times, I had to rely on what others in the scene were saying in response to understand what was going on.Unless you already own the other movies, I say get this film on VHS\/DVD to complete the series. I also think that this would be a pretty good third choice to rent.

The seeds were obviously sown long before they flourished to Oscar winning standards, and the cinematography is glorious.It is easy to see why IMDb has a low average rating for this movie. It is a little scatterbrain and certain plot points are left unexplained, leaving it feeling a little incoherent. Also, there is one particular sequence to do with the main character Richard, superbly portrayed by a comfortable DiCaprio, is isolated and begins to lose his marbles. This is very odd few minutes, baring very little relevance to the overall plot and it somewhat breaks flow.These gripes aside, the movie is an extremely interesting watch, for several reasons. Despite having all the hallmarks of a Boyle film, the cinematography is unique. It bares a similarity to Trainspotting, in that the main character is our narrator, but the strange mixture of intrigue, romance and adventure is certainly refreshing. Where the movie really excels however is its exploration of some little explored concepts.The idea of isolation in paradise, and the selfishness of human kind is explored in detail, with the private colony's leader, Sal (Tilda Swinton) being the personification of this concept. Robert Carlyle makes fleeting appearances as Daffy, a crazed former resident, disgusted by the cancerous human race. Are there elements of environmentalism in to be picked up on? Overall i thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The roots of Boyle's recent genius show sparks of the brilliance to come and the sheer uniqueness on show will be endearing to any regular film watcher.

Now, this movie gets bashed around a lot. Why you ask? Because Jason's not the killer big whoopie. Jason also wasn't the killer in number 1. But as we all know, people still complain about it.Now, even though the killer wasn't jason, the body count in this movie is still pretty frickin high. like 20 high. And that's pretty good for a guy who's NOT Jason. Actually, that's the highest body count up until then. In the later movies Jason had to work on catching up to Roy. And that's pretty damn cool.Plotwise it's like this. Tommy has grown up since the 4th movie and is in a halfway house for crazy people. Right before he gets there though one of the people living there is busy chopping wood in the stupidest way possible and after the fat kid annoys him, he kills the fat kid. (rubs temple) who was the GENIUS who gave the kid in the halfway house for crazy people an AXE?! WHO thought that would be a good idea?! Anyway, Tommy arrives and is socially awkward as he sees visions of Jason everywhere. And lo and behold a Jason shows up and starts to kill people! oh snap! So after a whole bunch of honestly, pretty cool killings, Tommy, a black kid, and a girl finish off the Jason lookalike, who happens to be really a paramedic Roy, the father of the kid who got axed.Tommy ends up in hospital with the jason mask and they act as if he's going to kill the girl.

Genie and Billy have just moved into a scary looking haunted house in a small town. On the way to a shop their car is attacked by a dog and they drown. They die but as we all know when you die you become a ghost, or sometimes a zombie. It turns out though that there are rules, bureaucracy, and a whole new world (don't you dare close your eyes!) of the undead. They are given a massive rulebook for ghosts called 'The Unholy Bible' which tells them their powers and responsibilities. It turns out that they can stay together, but that they are trapped within the confines of the walls of their house. If they step outside they'll be eaten by a graboid.

He plays a malevolent demon called Beetleguy, but if you say his name 3 times he turns into a bee and flies into your mouth. He specialises in ridding houses of pesky humeans, and will go to extreme lengths to achieve his goals such as making their trousers fall down in public. Genie and Billy give him the job but they realise he is too evil and wants to hurt the people. They have become fond of Winowner who plays their odd goth\/emo\/punk.metalhead\/hippy\/weirdo\/son\/daughter, and who happens to be able to see the dead. Beetleguy wants to marry her and then do things to her so they all have to work together to stop him. There is top class acting from everyone here, especially from Keats just one year before he dons the cape to become Clark Kent. He improvises many lines and shows his comedy stylings from his days as a comedian in such shows as Taxi and MASH. His most famous line is of course 'Go ahead&#x85; make my day punk!' but is also known for coming up with the popular phrase 'I'm the ghost with some toast'. He has many monologues, talks into the camera and has a dolphin of a times, coming out with filthy gems like 'Let's turn on the juice and shake out our juice!' when he sees a strip club has been built in his town. His chemistry with Winoprah is like Hydrochloric acid mixed with sulphur, but not as smelly- Betelguy (after Lydia says his name three times) Time to playee!Overall this is a mostly enjoyable film, but perhaps too scary for the younglings. It was certainly too scary for me.

Since the successes of The Man Who Knew Too Much and The 39 Steps, his destiny as a suspense filmmaker had been revealed not only to himself but also to his bosses at Gaumont. He was now only assigned material suitable to his area of expertise, and given a considerable amount of freedom to play around with the form. At the tail end of his British period, at a time when standard cinematic technique and narrative convention were well established, Hitchcock was effectively a researcher, of the kind that hadn't really been seen since the days of Griffith.Sabotage is adapted from the Joseph Conrad novel Secret Agent, and it's worth taking a peek at a synopsis of the book to see the differences in the movie version, two of which are very significant. Firstly the novel is a kind of anti-heroic piece told largely from the point-of-view of the villainous Verloc. You couldn't have that in cinema in the 30s, so Verloc's opponents are beefed up into morally sound protagonists. However, it is still revealed from the outset that Verloc is the culprit, and we the audience are always kept aware of his doings even when the heroes are not. Dispensing with the Agatha Christie form of whodunit is essential to the Hitchcockian mode of suspense building. Revealing the identity and intentions of a killer keeps the audience constantly wondering when and how he will strike again.The other important difference between the novel and film, is that Conrad states quite explicitly that Verloc and co. are anarchists, delving quite deeply into their ideology, as well as implying that they are Russians. Hitchcock's picture however makes no mention of the politics or nationality of the villains. They are simply generic foreign terrorists, existing to make the plot work. Imagine how much weaker this picture would be if we were asked to think about Verloc's motives. He has thick eyebrows, a sinister accent and he puts bombs on buses. What more do you need? On a purely formalist level, Hitchcock's method is becoming increasingly streamlined. This is perhaps the earliest of his pictures which really feels like it was planned shot by shot before a single camera rolled. Of particular note is Hitch's staging of drama through reaction shots rather than expository dialogue. For example, Oskar Homolka's reaction to Stevie talking about gangsters, or pair of close-ups after John Loder is pulled through the air vent that tells us one of the gang members has recognised him. There are a few pointless technical touches, such as Homolka's vision of London in the fish tank glass, or Stevie's face popping up among the crowd of boys, but these are not as distracting as they could be in Hitch's earliest pictures.Hitchcock rarely gave his actors any coaching, and relied upon a good professional cast to deliver the goods. In Sylvia Sydney and Oskar Homolka he has two of the best leads he had worked with so far, and their restrained naturalistic performances make their climactic scene together incredibly effective. The supporting cast are not bad either, although as usual with Hitchcock the comedy characters are the real standouts. Little-known stage veteran William Dewhurst, who plays the professor, is a joy to watch, and it almost looks as if his scenes are about to turn into Monty Python sketches.Much as I detest the phrase experimental film, this was truly an experimental era for Hitchcock, or at least one in which his pictures were going through a process of natural selection. He realised afterwards he had made a huge mistake in one aspect of the main suspense sequence on the bus &#x96; I won't reveal it here as it's a major spoiler &#x96; and would ensure he never repeated the error. In spite of what was for him an embarrassing flaw, Sabotage is a very enjoyable and effective thriller, not among the greatest of his British period, but certainly worth watching.

In spite of what was for him an embarrassing flaw, Sabotage is a very enjoyable and effective thriller, not among the greatest of his British period, but certainly worth watching.

Watching the film I thought of another of Cocteau's famous same sex liaisons, Cocteau and actor Jean Marais. It seems closest to what Hurt fantasizes for himself with Priestley.With an obvious bow to Thomas Mann who wrote about a similar story in Rome, Love And Death On Long Island concerns a middle aged writer with the gruesome name of Giles De'Ath played by John Hurt. He's a cultured gay man who lives alone and has pretty much let life pass him by. He does without television, a computer, but is persuaded to go to the cinema in London which he hasn't visited in over 20 years because an adaption of one of E.M. Forster's stories is on the bill.Instead he buys a ticket for a teen sex comedy flick, Hot Pants College II and is struck dumb by the physical beauty of one of the cast members, Jason Priestley. It happens to all of us be it the same or the opposite sex, but Hurt decides he has to get close to him and never mind those pesky laws about stalking.He researches his love object from, where else, those adolescent teen magazines. And finding out he lives in the Hamptons out in Suffolk County, Hurt goes to America and then takes that long ride from Penn Station out to the Hamptons to see if he can arrange an 'accidental' meeting.It works beyond Hurt's wildest expectation, though Priestley's girl friend, fashion model Fiona Loewi doesn't know quite what to make of Hurt.

Sadly, this movie does little justice to the series.The special effects are rather substandard, and this wasn't helped by the flat camera-work. The script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour. Other films with under-par scripting are Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat, Thomas and the Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion.Now I will say I liked the idea of the story, but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early, and I am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy. And I was annoyed by the talking suit, despite spirited voice work from Wayne Knight.But the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah, all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has pulled off some good performances before, but he didn't seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing, and Elizabeth Hurley's character sadly came across as useless. Daryl Hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored, and I liked the idea of her being the love interest, but sadly you see very little of her,(not to mention the Monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them) likewise with Wallace Shawn as some kind of government operative. Christopher Lloyd acquits himself better, and as an actor I like Lloyd a lot(he was in two of my favourite films Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I am fond of Back To The Future) but he was given little to work with, and had a tendency to overact quite wildly.Overall, as much I wanted to like this movie, I was left unimpressed.
