But even that didn't prepare me for when my family rented it & I was stuck watching it. I was right when I guessed it was a movie to keep away from; the whole time I sat there thinking This isn't good, this isn't good. Usually when I love a movie I decide while watching, but it's AFTER that I say I hate it. Jim Carey wasn't to blame - like every other role I see him preform, he did very well. The zaniness he put into the Grinch matched that of other characters - the Mask, Ace Ventura, the Riddler. The problem w\/the Grinch - & just about everything else - was that it was anti-Suess in a way. Instead of being comical for all, it's not anything you'd understand if you're under 10. The writers fowled up too many points from the book. The Grinch is supposed to be an enigmatic Christmas-hater who isn't in public except to steal the holiday 1 year. In this he's an obnoxious prankster who wrecks havoc everywhere. The scene where he's in the post office cackling while switching notes This is yours and now it's his; this was his and now it's hers made me sick. The worst 1 was when he stands on the cliff overlooking Whoville reading a list proclaiming, I hate you...Hate...Hate...Double-hate...LOATHE! That works fine for a wacky Carrey character, but ruins the Grinch's. Cindy becomes a main character - in the book she's mentioned 1ce; in the old cartoon she's shown most probably because she's only named person. Here she's the 1 person who feels that there's more to Christmas than $\/gifts & tries to convince every1 else - even by dragging the Grinch into the picture. The audience never learns WHY he hates Christmas; he just does & it's left at that. But here we get a ludicrous story of how he mixed w\/the Who kids, had a love relationship ridiculed on Christmas, & became a recluse. It's pretty stupid how after this the narrator goes The Grinch hated Christmas, no 1 quite knows the reason to keep the book's old line! It's almost as if the audience is supposed to give him a sympathy card & hate the townsfolk! The attempt to let him join the holiday made him a target by his old rival, the current Mayor (Jeffrey Tambor) & that's when he decides to crash the party, then steal Christmas. 1 change that seems small is actually a big deal - the Whos' being materialistic is 1 major change from the book & ruins the story. After stealing Christmas, the Grinch hears them singing joyously anyway, & realizes Christmas isn't about gifts. But since these Whos are greedy, they have to learn the lesson as if stealing it actually needed to be done! Grinch - his name here; his title is not the Grinch as it should be - having a romance w\/a human is rotten. I just know Dr. Suess is turning in his grave at that. I'll admit this isn't 100% bad - the scenes of Max, especially dancing, the definition of potpourri & the tunnel ride are laughable; the cartoon song is thankfully still around; the cat getting vacuumed w\/the gifts is embarrassingly funny. But these details only save it from getting a 0; it's beyond help. As a movie on its own, I'm sure it's another funny 1 about the real meaning of Christmas, like The Kranks.

I laughed at situations in this movie, but I did not laugh when Billy Crystal tried to crack jokes.This movie was about a bunch of guys going through mid-life crises. They try to go on adventures to make their life exciting. I like that idea. I liked the scenes of running with the bulls in Spain. That seems like a romantic thing to do. I also liked that they end up going on a cattle drive, but the story really didn't go anywhere exciting. They deal with problems that really didn't excite me or interest me. I was really feeling bored at the end of the movie. I don't have Adult deficit disorder, but I was showing signs of it at the end of this movie. I was getting antsy, and I really didn't feel like paying attention to the movie. The ending was too boring and predictable.The most amazing thing about this movie is that Jack Palance won a best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. How and Why? He was in the movie for about 5 minutes. How could he win? He played a cranky old cowboy that everyone is scared of, but I didn't feel it was convincing or worthy of an Oscar.

We never finished it but I am going to comment on what I was able to see; which was probably the first 25 minutes of it. The first part of the movie that appealed to me was the animation. I think that this type of animation was really cool. It was not a cartoon animation completely but had parts that were very similar. I found this type of animation very interesting. This type of animation was very affective when showing the impact of a conversation. When the two people in the beginning are talking about a tiger I liked how the background got orange for a minute to impact the conversation about the tiger that they were having. When the man in the movie was having the dream in the beginning when he woke up and the screen showed white to break up his dream from the real world, I liked that part especially. I think these film tactics are good use of color and transitioning from one scene to the next. Lastly, from the animation stand point I really liked the interesting boat car that the man in the beginning drove. It was very unusual, as was the situation that the car put the man in. My favorite analogy from the movie was the crayon image. I think it is true that everyone is born with different talents, crayons, but that it is up to oneself to utilize them and make a difference. I also like the quote, our decision who we are. I am a person that believes that it is up to oneself to make the difference. I think that in order to get something done one needs to be proactive and not just sit around waiting for something to happen. Another quote from the movie that displays this idea of making your life what you want it to be is, your life is yours to create. I think that throughout the movie the topics that are discussed are topics that are the ones that really pull a person's character out of them. People always say that politics and religion draw people's true character out of them. In this movie it really touches on a person's thoughts on these topics. I thought the comment on the voting and how it is really for one puppet or another was an interesting thought, and at sometimes seems all too true. Well this is all I have so far, but like I said, I haven't seen the whole movie yet. I do plan on watching the rest.

The 'Richard's-going-mad-cartoon\/video-game' sequence is quite mad, and reverts into Leo rather than Richard again, but it's only a short scene. I love Étienne and I feel really sorry for him!! It's so unfair, and Françoise is so unfaithful!! Also, in response to the person who said a community of 20-year-olds with no kids is unlikely- did you see the scene where Sal and Richard are doing the 'shopping trip' back to the mainland, and are laden with everyone's requests, not least a very large pack of Durex? I love the Beach and I would recommend at least one viewing to everyone. if you hate it after that, fair enough; but give it a chance, regardless of Leo diCaprio.

But I decided what the heck I went out and rented it. I turned on the movie and my eyes were GLUED to the T.V. though the whole movie. When it first came on I thought where's the fighting? Where's the gore? But, as it got going I realized this movie is much deeper! Edward Norton gives a spectacular performance as a man who hates his life! He hates his job and his boss. His life seems to be going nowhere. If you add insomnia on top of that well, who knows what he's capable of! Then Ed (aka Jack) meets Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt whom also gives a stunning performance)who helps him fix his life by helping him create underground Fight Clubs. Where men can come to beat the heck out of each other to relieve anger and stress. But then everything goes haywire when Tyler gets out of control!And on top of that Marla ,a fellow life hater, gets in the middle. I don't what to spoil it for you but this movie has an explosive ending! You'll never expect it! Ed Norton and Brad Pitt fans will fall in love with Fight Club!

But quickly the beautiful black and white photography caught my eye and I was drawn into Isak Borg's story, or rather, his self-examination.The progression of the film is fantastic. Early in the film, Isak has an apparition within a dream and the small events leading up to it, within the dream, are quite brilliant. Throughout the rest of the film there are dreams and recollections; newly discovered secrets of the past that Isak sees for the first time. As he says in the film, Dreams, as if I must tell myself something I won't listen to when I'm awake. How Bergman shows us the characters is terrific. It's a like a relaxed puzzle that doesn't emphasize any sort of urgency to figure things out. The story unfolds beautifully as we get a deeper sense of Isak, who I assume is an alter ago of Ingmar Bergman at that stage of his life (he was thirty-nine when the film was released).It pains me to know that the majority of people my age would rather watch an Adam Sandler movie or The Rock than something like this. Hey, I liked Big Daddy and I love Nicolas Cage, but Wild Strawberries is one of the few films I've seen that could possibly change the way I live my life. I'm always interested in listening to what aged people have to say about their own life because, well, it can only give me tips about my own, and that's what this film does in a way.There is one sequence in the film that is frightening and arty, and I don't completely grasp what it means beyond Isak's deterioration and his realization of how people actually feel towards him (he's told earlier in the film as well, but he seems to accept this verdict more readily), but it doesn't take away from the film; rather, it's an interesting addition to an otherwise satisfying experience. In fact, it's probably the most vital part of the movie -- Isak may not like it, bbut once he gets past it, he has the option to develop.I don't know if the film is a masterpiece -- it's my introduction to Bergman, so once I see Cries and Whispers, Fanny and Alexander, Persona and The Seventh Seal (if I can get through it, this time) I'll come back to this film with a new perspective, or at least see it as a part of Bergman's whole. I do think this is a great film of its type. It's the kind of film that may require viewings every five or so years, as a sort of reminder.Pauline Kael once said that she didn't think much of Bergman because she'd done her share of soul-wrestling and it wasn't that difficult. The film isn't as challenging as I was expecting it to be, in fact, it's a walk in the park. It's pleasant and rich and beautiful, and the title seems perfect after you've seen the film.

I 'got it' alright. I just don't want it.The story begins when naive college boy finds a human ear in a grown-over abandoned lot near his father's home, puts it in a bag, and takes it to the police station, where his discovery is greeted with a diffident, Yup, that's a human ear alright. A conversation with the town sheriff's teenage daughter reveals that it might have something to do with a mysterious and glamorous lounge singer. So Jeffrey does what anyone would do- break into her apartment and spy on her, of course. And finding him hiding in her closet, listening to her phone conversations and watch her undress, the lounge singer, Dorothy, does what any woman would do under the circumstances- give him oral sex, of course! It practically goes without saying! The two of them embark on a lopsided affair that never fully blossoms, while Jeffrey woos sweet teenage Sandy on the side. Meanwhile, wrapped up in unstable Dorothy's sexual psychodrama, Jeffrey plays some cross between detective and knight and shining armor to a damsel in distress, and revels in Dorothy's co-dependent clinging, all the while knowing that this affair could get him killed.Dorothy's lover\/stalker\/tormentor is a ragingly nuts, repulsively perverted mafia a-hole named Frank, in the most disgustingly creepy role in Dennis Hopper's proud legacy of playing scary, nutbag freaks. Frank's infantile-yet-violent, jack rabbit dry-humping perversion, not to mention his obliviousness to how obnoxious and repugnant it is, is enough to make you never want to have sex again. Yet, Frank and Dorothy are both quite obviously insane- what's Jeffrey's excuse for his bizarre, irrational choices? The fact that he is apparently sane and fairly intelligent makes it all the more annoying. Every single character in the film is so annoying to me that I want to smack 'em upside the head, but the two women in the story are just plain pitiful.Sandy and Dorothy are sort of a Betty and Veronica\/rose white-rose red case. Dorothy is an older, glamorous, beautiful brunette, while Sandy is a younger, pretty, virginal blonde. Sandy is the least stupid and irritating character in the beginning, but I lost patience with her after she immediately forgave Jeffrey for his affair with Dorothy with very little explanation or effort from Jeffrey, then continually pins the blame on herself for dragging him into this when the situation is quite the opposite. Sandy puts herself in harm's way for Jeffrey even though he has lied to her, and at the close of the film is in the kitchen happily making him lunch while he lounges around in the back yard. For his part, Jeffrey just seems like a melodramatic sap who's in love with whoever's there at the moment. You really can't tell if his feelings for either Dorothy or Sandy have any depth to them.What really works my nerves, though, is the woefully corny dialog, with absurdly over-earnest lines like, Why is there so much trouble in the world?!?! and You're my special friend! Not to mention, I looked for you in the closet last night. Granted, all these lines are kinda funny, but are they supposed to be? And who's the joke on, the characters or the viewer. Either way, if it weren't for my roommate being there to mock it with me, I would have turned this movie off about 15 minutes into it.How movies like this gain backing, let alone a cult following, I'll never know.

I'm curious to read a review of this kind. I've seen The Hustler and rank it very high on my list of great films. So I can only write a review of this other kind. If you know the story from Hustler (and love it), how can you not be interested in what happens to Fast Eddie later in life? I was immediately aware of the extension of ideas (money, excellence, honor, pride, and deceit) from The Hustler and curious to see where Scorsese would take them. I think he's true to the time period the clothing (and Vince's hair!), the music (very 80's), and the shift of values (as compared to 60s; e.g. cocaine replacing alcohol). Fast Eddie is also true to his age (and former excellence as a hustler). It feels like he's inherited a bit of Bert (from The Hustler), a festering bitterness and pride, which reemerges when he meets Vince. I actually liked Tom Cruise as the innocent Vince and thought he played him perfectly. I winced to see him lose that innocence, which is probably what the film means to do. Mastroantonio is also pretty fabulous and yet no where near as cognizant and complex as Piper Laurie's character in The Hustler. In that respect, this film is not as cool as The Hustler.

Also, this movie does not attempt to gloss over Fast Eddie's faults (indeed it focuses on them intensely), and it doesn't mean to have him come to some redemption (although he does return to some of his former glory as a pool player).

How can anyone in his right mind, and with a career like Micheal york had agree to perform in a movie with a script, plot and effects like this. Was he bored? In dire need of money? we'll never know i guess. It must have been a joke.I just watched it again on TV.This is not only Yorks worst movie ever. Not even Dien's worst movie ever ( to be honest i've never seen a good movie with him period. Starship Troopers featured some of the lousiest acting i've come across too ) but this movie i think qualifies as the worst movie of all time. Directing, editing, acting, plot line. My 2-year old nephew would have done better.Who came up with this crap? And they made a sequel too.

A lot of new shows seem to be doing this. They understand that it's funny these days to be slightly post-modern, being a comedy\/actioner\/whatever whilst simultaneously mocking the incredulity of its own events.But they don't understand that unless there's a good movie behind it all, then it just all turns into tedious, random, almost hurtful jokes that ultimately make you wish you'd rented something else. If the writers clearly don't care about the material, why should you? 'Not Another Teen Movie' is a spoof of twenty years worth of teen movies. The plot is chopped together from the various classic teen conundrums that have enchanted us over the last two movie-going decades the bet that backfires, the ugly duckling story, the horny high schoolers and their attempts to get laid etc.The problems in this movie start from the minute the titles roll. I get the feeling the script was written by a bunch of guys remembering the most famous scenes of all the teen movies they had seen, and saying Hey guys! I always thought it would be funny if instead of going to the prom with Jenny instead of Katalin, he ... farted in her face and threw a used condom in the face of her strict religious mother! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Hence, Not Another Teen Movie is basically one scene repeating itself over and over again for ninety minutes. We'll be presented with an instantly recognisable scene, either by use of similar-looking actors (the American Pie sketches did this a lot) or memorable dialogue (for example the Bring It On spoof about being in a 'cheerocracy.') Then something crude will happen, more often than not involving oral sex and\/or more oral sex. Or the disabled, or issues of discrimination. Ha ha ha.Such an approach might have worked if the screenplay could have been kept tight, with a small number of memorable characters. Instead, Not Another Teen Movie makes a mission of trying to visit every teen movie that was ever released. Think you're a film buff? Think again. To understand even half of what's being spoofed, you need to have seen more films than Roger Ebert. Too often, the audience is dumped into a scene that makes absolutely no sense at all to the uninitiated. And yet other movies that were primarily spoofs, such as the excellent Airplane! and Naked Gun series, avoided this problem altogether by coming up with witty, original material, and putting in a movie reference whenever the opportunity obviously presented itself.Nonetheless, the makers of Not Another Teen Movie have certainly put together something that will make idiots laugh, and in turn bring in more idiots see it. It's just a pity that beneath the fart jokes, it's so cynically, desperately unfunny.
