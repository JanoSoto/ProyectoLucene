It's all a bit more personal this time around though as Brody's sons have decided to nip away on a careless little boat trip with their mates.Of course this sequel was never ever going to live up to the reputation of the first movie and of course it fails in almost every way when compared to that classic BUT it has to be said that I have always really liked this film. I have always felt that it followed the rule of sequels rather well and also added some interesting moments such as the use of sound\/vibrations to distract the shark away from potential victims. It also has one or two great jump scares and stays consistently entertaining throughout.Going along with the standard sequel rules, everything feels a bit bigger (from the shark to the potential bodycount) and a little bit lazier but it's hard to feel let down by a movie that delivers almost exactly what the audience is after and also throws in a scene where a shark attacks a flaming helicopter. And compared to the sequels that would come after it, this remains an above-average killer shark movie.See this if you like Jaws, Piranha, Deep Blue Sea.

DOUBLE TEAM is easily one of his lesser efforts despite some inspired casting and a few somewhat new ideas. Unfortunately, you've seen almost all of it before, including the name, which is almost indistinguishable from DOUBLE IMPACT or DEATH WARRANT. The idea of Van Damme teaming up with Dennis Rodman is so ludicrous that it's worthwhile for novelty&#x85; and the icing on the cake is that the two team up against Mickey Rourke&#x85; and have a 3-way shirtless fistfight in what I assume is supposed to be the Roman Coliseum (plenty of shades of RETURN OF THE DRAGON) at the end too&#x85; with a Tiger and landmines to boot! Well, the overall plot about Van Damme's pregnant wife getting kidnapped so Rourke can replace his adopted son with Van Damme's (?) doesn't amount to a hill of beans and quite poorly links together its many action sequences. The only neat non-action bit is a long section dealing with Van Damme going off the grid and joining a colony of other former CIA agents who have faked their own deaths. The flipside is that this lifestyle isn't quite utopic and ends up being a prison (a la The Prisoner) for Van Damme as he's playing the same revenge-driven character he always plays. Rourke and Rodman are equally 1-dimensional and Rodman manages to change his costume (and hairstyle) repeatedly between scenes which supposedly take place on the same day! It turns out that the whole faking-his-death thing was completely pointless as the first thing Van Damme does when he escapes it to lure Rourke into a trap which he blows right away once he spots his wife and tries to run after her&#x85; but whatever, we're not in this sort of thing because of the story. We're here to see Van Damme kick people in the face and break things. Unfortunately it's marred heavily with lots of intentional humor and bad basketball-related one-liners from Rodman's character, who I'm pretty sure isn't far different from Rodman himself. See? If your actors can't act, just not have them even bother trying to take on characters. Works like a charm.Fans of Italian crime and action movies will have a field day spotting cameos by some genre stalwarts. Bruno Bilotta (aka Karl Landgren), star of numerous poor 80's exploitation films, plays Rourke's main sniper and even scores a fight scene with Van Damme! Ottaviano Dell'Acqua plays a random Italian agent gunned down in glorious slow motion while Angelo Ragusa gets stabbed in the back and shot by a pair of not-so-helpless women. Ted Rusoff (a perennial figure in the world of ADR and voice dubbing going back to the AIP days of Samuel Z. Arkoff) plays a monk for the umpteenth time and even eurocrime great Orso Maria Guerrini is wasted in a nothing background role with no lines! This is no exception to the endless cycle of Van Damme teaming up with Hong Kong directors to attempt to repeat the same success as HARD TARGET and do for the likes of Ringo Lam what that film did for John Woo. Director Tsui Hark makes sure to throw in some patented kung fu fight scenes complete with plenty of gunplay, knifeplay, and attempts at strangulation. Add to that a complete overboard use of dutch angles and requisite poor CGI to make one generic 90's action movie experience complete! Worth it just to see Van Damme side-kick a growling tiger in the face, even if it does seem more the work of VFX than choreography.

The director is great at making action look cool. The fight scenes are fast, sharp and exciting, probably helped a lot by the choreography of Donnie Yen (although he was not alone). The actors were obviously replaced by computer graphics a few times but it's not too bad. One of the best parts of the film is the blood pack, a team of vampires. They might not be developed very much but they have killer looks and moves. The story had a promising concept, a new strain of vampires hunting traditional vampires, and their design was very good and creepy, especially the mouth. However, the action eclipses the story by a fair margin and there's not much plot development nor is it likely you will care much about the few dramatic elements. Wesley Snipes as Blade shows amazing physical prowess but almost always wearing his dark glasses is almost as stoic as Arnold in the Terminator movies. This is interesting to see as a stepping stone for talented director Del Toro's future projects the 2 Hellboys and Pan's Labyrinth. It's also a decent sequel to the first Blade without as much character development but stronger action and visual design. It's worth a rental and perhaps a buy if you're a Benicio Del Toro's or Blade fan.

I considered an 8, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie. I was not sure whether or not the bridge was destroyed or how it was going to go down. It was much more dramatic than I could have anticipated. It was a little campy, but Guiness held the ending by watching him realize how far his own ambitions had taken him. Guiness really held the movie together and I felt myself wanting to see him on screen. He really was fantastic and watching him at the end was perfect. I particularly liked seeing compose himself and remind himself that he is a gentleman in each meeting.I now have a slight man crush on William Holden and not because he was particularly good, but he was really charismatic in a few moments. The guy that played Saito was fantastic though. He had some really solid moments on screen and one can see how Ken Watanabe used this performance for his General in Letters from Iwo Jima. The scenes between Saito and Guiness were all great.So about the movie as a whole. I can see why it is so highly regarded and it really did feel epic, even on my small laptop, and I cannot even imagine watching this on the big screen. The jungle really did feel formidable and Lean did an excellent job of making it a character all of its own. The open shot did an excellent job of setting that up by combining the graves with thick jungle shots. It was an extremely memorable opening sequence for me. The movie even though it is terribly long never felt long to me and felt really well paced. When the Canadien and Holden start floating down the river the movie felt like an eternity, but in a good way because I really was not sure if that bridge was going to blow and how it would blow. To me it is really interesting that they made this war film without almost no one getting shot and very few on screens deaths. But we really have a great insight what war could do to these individuals and sense of duty that these individuals had.

I was not sure whether or not the bridge was destroyed or how it was going to go down. It was much more dramatic than I could have anticipated. It was a little campy, but Guiness held the ending by watching him realize how far his own ambitions had taken him. Guiness really held the movie together and I felt myself wanting to see him on screen. He really was fantastic and watching him at the end was perfect. I particularly liked seeing compose himself and remind himself that he is a gentleman in each meeting.I now have a slight man crush on William Holden and not because he was particularly good, but he was really charismatic in a few moments. The guy that played Saito was fantastic though. He had some really solid moments on screen and one can see how Ken Watanabe used this performance for his General in Letters from Iwo Jima. The scenes between Saito and Guiness were all great.So about the movie as a whole. I can see why it is so highly regarded and it really did feel epic, even on my small laptop, and I cannot even imagine watching this on the big screen. The jungle really did feel formidable and Lean did an excellent job of making it a character all of its own. The open shot did an excellent job of setting that up by combining the graves with thick jungle shots. It was an extremely memorable opening sequence for me. The movie even though it is terribly long never felt long to me and felt really well paced. When the Canadien and Holden start floating down the river the movie felt like an eternity, but in a good way because I really was not sure if that bridge was going to blow and how it would blow. To me it is really interesting that they made this war film without almost no one getting shot and very few on screens deaths.

A satellite 1000 miles will not orbit forever. The atmosphere pressure drops off exponentially (base 2.718) - that I would not expect to see in the lecture - so it goes on forever mathematically, but realistically there are some air molecules until you get really far out. The current ISS must be boosted up several times a year and thousands of pounds of fuel are used.2) Once the spaceship leaves the atmosphere there is no resistance to slow it up. Well, not much air resistance, but the Earth's gravity keeps slowing it down, and then the Moon's gravity is stronger and it pulls it in. But the Moon's gravity also goes out to the Earth (the tides). Gravity falls off like one over the distance squared, and extends forever in theory.3) Once you get away from the gravitational pull of the Earth, you fall wherever you are headed for. This is phrased oddly. A modern version would be that if you have a speed greater than the escape velocity, you... But the Sun is still pulling on you, and the orbital motion around the Sun is still there, so you move not in a straight line but in a curve that gets bigger (and maybe shallower) with time.4) Nice view of the differential calculating machine that had the spinning rods. 5) While the V-2 like ship would be good at taking off, I can't imagine landing with such a tall object. The LEM was squat with 4 legs. The idea of rocket stages maybe was not in the public imagination yet.6) They mention free orbit. What is that?7) They mentioned using titanium to reduce weight but then showed magnetic boots used in the ship, on all the surfaces. So it was loaded with steel. How about aluminum? Who cares if you float in the ship? This movie was similar to Conquest of Space. They both had crew members who had no training and no understanding of the most basic concepts. As for Rocketship X-M, some things were ridiculous. They were giving a news conference 12 minutes before the lift-off, in street clothes. Then they went straight up, say 200 miles, and then made a right turn and continued on that path. You would have zero speed in your orbital direction.How much does the public get its information from movies like these? If I ask today - Why do the astronauts float in the space shuttle? the answer is There is no gravity. What keeps the Moon going around the Earth? Gravity. So they have 2 opposite ideas at the same time. What is really happening? The astronauts are falling, and they miss the Earth. That is what the great speed is for. If there was no gravity, they would wander off somewhere. People also think that the North Star is the brightest star in the sky. I say, no it is average or even dim (magnitude 2) but no one believes me. Follow some of the bright objects, like Sirius, or Venus, and you really will be lost. So people today have a different image in the minds of what space travel should look like, but some details are still misunderstood. Almost no one thought the Moon mountains would be smooth and rounded - the shadows really are jagged.

If there was no gravity, they would wander off somewhere. People also think that the North Star is the brightest star in the sky. I say, no it is average or even dim (magnitude 2) but no one believes me. Follow some of the bright objects, like Sirius, or Venus, and you really will be lost.

A satellite 1000 miles will not orbit forever. The atmosphere pressure drops off exponentially (base 2.718) - that I would not expect to see in the lecture - so it goes on forever mathematically, but realistically there are some air molecules until you get really far out. The current ISS must be boosted up several times a year and thousands of pounds of fuel are used.2) Once the spaceship leaves the atmosphere there is no resistance to slow it up. Well, not much air resistance, but the Earth's gravity keeps slowing it down, and then the Moon's gravity is stronger and it pulls it in. But the Moon's gravity also goes out to the Earth (the tides). Gravity falls off like one over the distance squared, and extends forever in theory.3) Once you get away from the gravitational pull of the Earth, you fall wherever you are headed for. This is phrased oddly. A modern version would be that if you have a speed greater than the escape velocity, you... But the Sun is still pulling on you, and the orbital motion around the Sun is still there, so you move not in a straight line but in a curve that gets bigger (and maybe shallower) with time.4) Nice view of the differential calculating machine that had the spinning rods. 5) While the V-2 like ship would be good at taking off, I can't imagine landing with such a tall object. The LEM was squat with 4 legs. The idea of rocket stages maybe was not in the public imagination yet.6) They mention free orbit. What is that?7) They mentioned using titanium to reduce weight but then showed magnetic boots used in the ship, on all the surfaces. So it was loaded with steel. How about aluminum? Who cares if you float in the ship? This movie was similar to Conquest of Space. They both had crew members who had no training and no understanding of the most basic concepts. As for Rocketship X-M, some things were ridiculous. They were giving a news conference 12 minutes before the lift-off, in street clothes. Then they went straight up, say 200 miles, and then made a right turn and continued on that path. You would have zero speed in your orbital direction.How much does the public get its information from movies like these?

Stephen Spielberg's excellent Amistad from 1997 is one recent exception, and The Journey of August King, dating from two years earlier, is another.The film is set in the mountains of western North Carolina in 1815. August King is a young, recently widowed, farmer who inadvertently becomes involved in the attempt by a young female slave to flee from her cruel master. At this period aiding a fugitive slave was a criminal offence, but King decides to help her anyway, even though he knows that such a step could end in his ruin. The girl appears to have several names; at one point she claims that her real name is, bizarrely, Williamsburg, but that she is generally known either as Annalees, sometimes shortened to just Anna, or as Ella. For the sake of simplicity I will refer to her as Anna throughout.The plot is fairly simple. King takes Anna in his cart to help her on her journey, but every so often she is forced to hide when other people come into view. Her owner Olaf Singletary, who it turns out is also her natural father, has offered a large reward for her recapture, and King cannot trust anyone, even his neighbours, not to betray him. Visually, the film gives the impression that the North Carolina Appalachians in the 1810s were a pristine, virtually uninhabited, wilderness; we see plenty of scenes of forests and mountains but very few of houses, other than King's own, or of cultivated farmland. Yet the frequency with which King and Anna's journey is interrupted by the sudden appearance of other people would suggest that this seeming wilderness is in fact densely populated, as teeming with people as the most intensely farmed lowland areas.Despite a similar theme, The Journey of August King is not in the same class as Amistad, certainly not when it comes to acting. Spielberg's film could call on some splendid performances, especially from Anthony Hopkins and Djimon Hounsou, but there is nothing of that calibre here. Most of the characters come across as a bit one-dimensional. Singletary is simply an evil stage villain. Anna is a mixture of liberty-loving free spirit and playful minx. Thandie Newton is perhaps the nearest thing we have to a black British Hollywood superstar, but this is not really one of her better films, not as good as she was in Flirting or Jefferson in Paris. Her accent here seems to vary between a near-incomprehensible local vernacular and something much closer to Standard English.August is clearly written as a more complicated character. We are never quite sure of his exact motives for helping Anna. Opposition to the institution of slavery? (The film makes it clear that some white Southerners did indeed oppose slavery and that abolitionism was not confined to the North). Simple humanitarianism? Guilt arising from the death of his wife (which , we learn, was an act of suicide)? Or has he fallen in love with the attractive Anna? At one time the film seems to be setting up a romantic ending, with August and Anna falling in love and eloping together, but then seems to draw back from it, possibly because of Hollywood's traditional squeamishness about mixed-race love affairs. It is indeed possible that August acts out of a mixture of motives- the various possibilities set out above are by no means all mutually exclusive. The problem is that Patric never gives us much of a clue, playing his character throughout with a noble, stoical saintliness which never really hints at any greater complexity below the surface.As another reviewer has pointed out, films made in aid of good causes or about Big Themes are not automatically good films. Just as the recent The Reader has shown that it is possible to make a bad film about the Holocaust, so The Journey of August King shows that it is possible to make a mediocre one about slavery. Morally it is very worthy, but ends up as uninspired and rather dull. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 July 2009","score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Although there have been numerous films about the American Civil War, from Gone with the Wind to Cold Mountain via The Red Badge of Courage and Glory, films about the antebellum South and its peculiar institution of slavery are rarer.
