It's good entertainment all but nothing too great.And that is basically all this movie is; some good, simple entertainment. It's fun all but at the same time also rather simplistic. This especially goes for its story, which really is the foremost thing that is keeping the movie down and preventing it from ever becoming a true classic, or absolute must-see.I mean, I love the Edgar bug and Vincent D'Onofrio's performance but the whole villainous plot is kind of standard and shaky and also seems to be completely secondary for the movie as well. Really, the movie and its story are in its core all incredibly standard.Yet the movie still works out as good entertainment, which for most part is due to its two main characters and their dynamics. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are total opposites of each other, in about every way imaginable, which is the reason why their interactions work out as something great and amusing. Besides, they have some great chemistry together and play surprisingly well off each other. Surprising, since Tommy Lee Jones normally isn't the comedy type of guy and Will Smith at the time still had to somewhat proof and establish himself as a leading man in movies.Yes, as a comedy, or buddy flick if you will, this movie does not disappoint. It will make you laugh and keep you entertained, pretty much throughout its entire running time. It lets the time fly by really and the movie is over before you know it. It is a good thing that the movie doesn't waste any time on anything and keeps a fast pace throughout. It still has some distractions it it, which were unnecessary in my opinion, such as everything involving the Linda Fiorentino character.The special effects are all pretty good, especially also for 1997 standards. After all, it's also really still a science-fiction flick so its effects and look were also important for the movie. The movie besides uses some absolutely great makeup effects and creature design, by Rick Baker. Another thing that I'm really fond of is the musical score by Danny Elfman. It's some typical Elfman stuff, that suits the overall style and atmosphere of the movie very well. It also sadly is one of his last true great scores.All in all, really not a perfect movie but it still remains some good entertainment to watch.7\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"22 May 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" In all honesty, I have never been a too big fan of the Men in Black franchise.

Any flick with the title THE FINAL CHAPTER is guaranteed a hat trick of sequels up its sleeve, but to all intents & purposes- the boogeyman of Crystal Lake has been vanquished, the madness forgotten, the legend retired. It will take something brand new to get the blood coursing in this petrified old saw, to justify another jaunt down dead teenager lane. Can you really blame them for adding a fresh coat of paint on the formula when they just as easily could've Xeroxed a straight re-tread of the last 4 flicks? That's saying something because as movies go, the Friday THE 13TH series has to be one of the most joyfully repetitive of all time. Change is more frightening than an axe wielding psycho. Though hacked to death in our last installment, the specter of Jason Vorhees-that watcher in the woods, that mass murdering momma's boy- continues to haunt young Tommy Jarvis, he who slew the beast. Grown from precocious tweener to brooding adolescent with a look in his eye that guarantees he'll be taking an automatic to show n tell, Tommy boy is moving into a halfway house for troubled youths as our film opens, populated by a colorful cast of malcontents & head cases that make master Jarvis look sane. Primarily there's Reggie, a tough talking token black\/ precocious brat who's about as street as the one Big Bird lives on. What do these animal crackers have in common? They're the latest collection of teenage fodder, the annoying nobodies whose sole purpose is to die in elaborate execution scenes. The only difference this time is that Jason Vorhees himself is a no-show, the murders themselves authored by a totally average joe. This particularly enrages fan boys, who as a rule are fickle as a pack of soccer moms. You watch with eyes peeled as a hulking man in a hockey mask plows through the standard teenage wasteland, dispatching neer-do-wells & nincompoops with savage relish only to have the blood soaked rug pulled out from under when the big reveal comes, Scooby-doo style. Ouch. I don't have much of a problem with the big twist of A NEW BEGINNING; It adds more texture to the mythos by deepening the urban legend of the Crystal Lake slasher. Jason is here but he's not, his presence incorporeal & second-hand, an inspiring influence at best. All pervading evil. If you think about it it's creepy how he haunts like a ghost, his spirit so dogged that it functions like an infectious disease on pliant minds, inspiring them to take the mantel of avenging angel of the backwoods. It's an acknowledgement of how much power the story has accrued by this point, testament that Jason lives on in his world through folklore like a dark god. We the audience live with this immortal pop culture phantasm (as we do Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, Pinhead etc) & the people of Crystal Lake do the same.What's more radical is the jarring tonal shift, seriously differentiating itself from its forbears by imbuing an almost cartoony flourish to the material. The grit n grain, that homespun quality that made the first FRIDAYS so charming gets replaced with quasi-studio slickness. It's an impasse point where everything gets sillier. The lazy summer nihilism of the early camp blood flicks, their going-nowhere fast feeling gets progressively watered down from here on.The best scene is when annoying tard Joey gets chopped into pieces before our disbelieving eyes. It's a guilty scream. I rewound it over & over with my friend as we guffawed over clouds of smoke. A lonely, sensitive lad getting brutally axe murdered, smears of chocolate on his face (as the blade cracks his spine) letting you know its all for yucks. You feel bad for laughing but it's too deliberately pathetic & manipulative to lose any sleep over. Politically incorrect hilarity that if you showed a bunch of kids would still play well. I mean, this is definitely the kind of wavelength I was on at 12.Likewise, the other spam is at their height of dated obnoxiousness robot dances, goth regalia, rednecks that make the DELIVERANCE freaks look like they have all their chromosomes, paint peeling profanity, jerri curls- A NEW BEGINNING is almost parody, usual slasher tropes blown up to lurid dimensions. This isn't to mention all the fun bags on display- we got us the most loosely lewd & casually vulgar of the bunch here.

The film, based on a true story, shows us the life and ordeal of John Merrick (John Hurt), a 21 year old man whose face is severely disfigured as a result of a progressive disease, so much so, that he has to wear a hood and a cap when he's in public. He earns his living for himself and his owner by being displayed at various freak shows. It's clear that everybody wants to see the deformed man, but, nobody wants to understand him, rescue him and treat him like a normal person.

From then on, John Merrick is introduced to a new world.

After travelling to a new town he now calls himself Jerry Blake & has found a new job as a real estate agent, Jerry has also found himself a new family. Jerry has married widow Susan Maine (Shelley Hack) but is having problems with her daughter Stephanie (Jill Schoelen) who resents Jerry & even has an intense dislike of him. After reading about the murdered family in a nearby town Stephanie becomes suspicious, especially after witnessing Jerry lose his temper on several occasions & decides to investigate further. Jerry becomes aware of Stephanie's suspicions & starts to realise that his 'perfect' family is falling apart, eventually Jerry decides he has to start again fresh & that he has to dispose of his current disappointing family...This British & American co-production was directed by Joseph Ruben & seems to be considered a bit of a classic in some circles, I must admit that I have no idea why & thought The Stepfather was a throughly average film. It's quite hard to define The Stepfather within the confines of one genre, I was expecting a slasher style horror film but The Stepfather is probably more a psycho thriller in the vein of Fatal Attraction (1987) which was released the same year. Like it's big budget Hollywood blockbuster The Stepfather hinges on family values & just how important they are to us, in the case of Jerry Blake he will literally kill for the perfect family & the idyllic existence that we are all brought up to aspire to, while Fatal Attraction places emphasis on it's family life with Michael Douglas doing all he can to salvage it & that it should be cherished & respected The Stepfather goes in the other direction & weaves it's story around the idea that family values are outdated & the perfect family simply does not exist & trying to attain it will only end in tears & misery. While the two films take opposite opinions I think the truth lies somewhere between the two, there's nothing wrong with traditional family life but at the same time it's near impossible for things to be completely perfect. At just over 80 minutes long The Stepfather moves along at a fairly sedate pace, while it's not boring it's hardly exciting either. The character's are alright if a little dumb at times & there's a real lack of slasher conventions until the final ten minutes in which we get a knife wielding maniac, a gratuitous shower scene & a final girl who defeats the bad guy after a chase. The Stepfather is competently written, plotted & it's alright to watch but I don't really understand the great reputation it has, I thought it was strictly average & I wouldn't want to see it again any time soon.The Stepfather looks alright, it has no great visual style but it's well made I suppose. Those looking for gore & novelty killings should stick with the likes of The Nightmare on Elm Street & Friday the 13th franchises & there's very little here. A guy is beaten with a plank of wood, a couple of dead bodies are seen, someone is shot & stabbed in the arm & that's about it. The script was apparently based loosely on the case of John List who killed in family in 1971 & remained on the run until 1989.Supposedly filmed in 40 days in Washington & in British Columbia in Canada on what must have been a fairly low budget The Stepfather has good production values. The acting is alright, I keep reading how great Terry O'Quinn is in the role but I was less impressed, sure he's fine but I didn't enjoyed his performance particularly.The Stepfather is a film with a great reputation & strong following but I must admit to being somewhat baffled by what people see in it, sure it's not terrible but I didn't think it was anything great either.

The writing in this movie is an 8 out of 10. Its a more than solid idea for a movie with a nicely adapted story. What put this movie over the top for me was the acting. I usually can't stand Vin Diesel or Ben Affleck, but this movie makes me think there's hope for them yet. Affleck sells it with the cocky, over the top character, and diesel plays a similar character with a conscience. The actor that steals the show however, is Giovanni Ribisi. He plays a character who is a slacker,but a guy who is clearly smart and knows how to make money for himself. When all is lost and you feel he is a one dimensional heartless character like the rest (minus Diesel), he does everything in his power to get Harry Reynard, a hard working family man, his money back that he had lost in the scam that was JT Marlin. As i said before, the writing in the movie gets a, 8 out of 10, and the acting gets a 9 out of 10. Props to Ben Younger, Giovanni Ribisi and a surprisingly good performance by Vin Diesel and Ben Affleck. Notable supporting roles to Scott Caan, Tom Everett Scott and Ron Rifkin. Excellent movie.

I usually can't stand Vin Diesel or Ben Affleck, but this movie makes me think there's hope for them yet. Affleck sells it with the cocky, over the top character, and diesel plays a similar character with a conscience. The actor that steals the show however, is Giovanni Ribisi. He plays a character who is a slacker,but a guy who is clearly smart and knows how to make money for himself. When all is lost and you feel he is a one dimensional heartless character like the rest (minus Diesel), he does everything in his power to get Harry Reynard, a hard working family man, his money back that he had lost in the scam that was JT Marlin. As i said before, the writing in the movie gets a, 8 out of 10, and the acting gets a 9 out of 10.

Several reviewers evidently take this movie as a convenient platform from which to bash the Religious Right&#x99; for not adhering to the Christian-hating Left's benighted sexual libertinism. To be sure, Skipped Parts is rather brutally frank about all matters of sexuality, but as at least one reviewer pointed out already, the pro-abortion and anti-family bigots of the Left will find very little of this frankness to be at all friendly to their despicable ideology. Actually, one would be hard-pressed to find any message to this movie at all, as it is more a reflection of our times than an effort to shape them.This brings me to one of the real strikes against this movie though set in the 1960s around the time of John F. Kennedy's assassination, the protagonists (Sam, Lydia, and to a lesser degree her cousin Delores) all have ridiculously anachronistic points of view for people from the 1960s, while the antagonists (Sam Callahan, Dothan Talbot, Coach Howard Stebbins, to a lesser degree Maurey's parents, and to an even lesser degree the rest of the students and townspeople) are all basically contemporary Hollywood caricatures of people from the early 1960s. Someone is clearly guilty of either executive meddling or lazy writing.Yes, there were easy girls and single mothers back in the 1960s, but none of them would have thought and behaved the way Lydia does, nor would society have dealt with them so mildly if they had; nobody would even have considered rolling out a welcome wagon for a single mother and her illegitimate child in the first place, nor allowed their children to hang around with Sam. Moreover, in those days when the unwritten law was still somewhat in effect, the threatened violence against Sam, played for laughs in this movie, would have been no joke. He would be fortunate if Maurey's aggrieved father didn't decide to invite him to a shotgun wedding ceremony that was all shotgun and no wedding.As for the much-remarked hypocrisy of several of the characters (particularly Coach Stebbins and Maurey's mother), I'll concede that stereotypes &#x97; yes, even Hollywood's &#x97; are not entirely without foundation; hypocrisy and hypocrites we have with us always. Anyone who thinks this hypocrisy is offered as any kind of justification for Lydia's evil beliefs and behaviors, however, would do well to reconsider. Sincerity by itself, as Lydia demonstrates, is no virtue at all, and hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue. In this movie, vice pays a very grim tribute indeed to virtue in several truly horrifying scenes concerning Lydia's attempt to cover up Sam and Maurey's mistake by murdering their unborn baby.Most horrifying of all is the scene in which Sam pleads that it's his baby too; doesn't he get any say in what happens to his child? No, Lydia insists, he doesn't. In fact, nothing he says can sway her, though he promises to take responsibility, get a job, marry the girl, do anything if only his mother will let them keep the baby. In the end, it's hypocrisy which proves to be both a deus ex machina and diabolus ex machina, as Maury's mother happens to be down at the very same illegal murder mill having her love child with Coach Stebbins butchered, traumatizing both mother and daughter when they meet and leading to a very awkward moment between Sam and Stebbins as well. How can I *not* see this as being a thoroughly damning portrayal of abortion and all of the cruel baby-butchering child-snatching misandrists calling themselves feminists who support it?No, unlike some reviewers here, I would definitely *not* show this movie to teenagers as a part of their sex education. If we must have entertainment while educating our kids about sex, we have plenty of other more informative and positive movies that would serve the purpose far better The Blue Lagoon (1980) and 17 Again (2009) come to mind. Honestly, did that gross-out moment with Lydia and the sock, or any of the references to oral sex (which also quite understandably grossed out Sam and Maurey) need to be in this movie at all? It would have been far more enjoyable to watch without them. Some movies really should be exclusively restricted to adults even if some of the main characters are kids, and this is one of them.If anything, Lydia's efforts to expose Sam to too much of our unrated world too soon is a precautionary tale, not an example to be followed as some of the more foolish reviewers here seem to believe. Yes, Lydia does seem to be a bit more responsible by the end, having gotten a job and a man to support her so she won't end up being another welfare leech (the way so many single mothers these days are), but it's not clear that she's really learned her lesson; neither she nor anyone else shows any remorse for having nearly murdered her granddaughter, and there's no wedding scene, so it's not clear whether she's actually married to Hank even by common law.Ultimately, however, the reason I don't like this movie very much is that the story is actually rather depressing. Skipped Parts is a comedy, yes, but a black comedy full of disgusting behavior leading to mood whiplash and coming to an only partially satisfying ending. I sympathized with Sam, laughed at the funny parts and was duly horrified at the horrifying parts. On the whole, I don't regret watching it, and I think anyone who can take a few revolting scenes and characters in stride and doesn't mind a few anachronistic attitudes could benefit from seeing this movie. All the same, I'd rather not see this movie again any time soon, if ever. It might be worth a rental, but the jury's still out on whether it will ever be worth a purchase.

It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Jerry Fielding and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Material Not Previously Published or Produced. It was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 69 on 100 Movies, 100 Thrills. Very good!

Disney brought a book to life when it should have been brought to life.Joel Chandler Harris a native of Eatonton, Georgia and an American Journalist, fiction writer, and folklorist authored in 1881 during the post-Civil War and during the Post-Reconstruction period in Atlanta, Georgia a collection of Folk tales based on African-American oral traditions and Cherokee folk tales. The compilation of these stories was titled Uncle Remus. Some chide Harris other praise Harris for his observation of what I have come to view as the plight of slaves under the boot of slave owners in the pre-civil war period. Folk tales have always been a way to pass on knowledge and a way deal with and overcome difficult situations and these stories are parables in the most traditional sense. I have never heard anyone consider that Walt Disney may have produced Song of The South as a protest against Segregation. Social change was in the wind and rapidly coming and the Release by Walt Disney and Howard Hughes and RKO Pictures on November 12th 1946 of Song of The South cannot be coincidental and signaled part of that cultural change,as only a year and a half would pass before President Harry S. Truman on July 31, 1948 desegregated the military. I remember seeing Song of the South as a child and found it to be a wonderfully delightful animated feature film. As an adult and with what I can remember about the movie I am now inclined to believe that Walt Disney was advocating social change and in reality actually poking fun at racism but especially southern racist, he himself having grown up in the segregated southern racist city of Kansas City Missouri, living in what is considered today part of the Black Community and in Mr. Disney's day what may have been considered part of a mixed race area of Kansas City and\/or at the very least the Black Community. Walt Disney grew up at 3028 Bellefontaine about six blocks East and nine blocks South or about a mile and one- half from the home field of the World Famous Kansas City Monarch's baseball team from 1923-1950 and the pride of the Baseball Negro League the stadium being located at 20th and Prospect Ave the heart of the Black Community. Given the place that Mr. Disney grew up he must have had a lot of exposure to the black community and he must have been socially conscious and keenly aware of the social injustice associated with Kansas City and its segregationist policies and the inequality of equal rights between blacks and whites.It make me sad to think that the film vaults remain closed to probably one of the first socially conscious anti-segregation films made at a time that preceded President Truman's Desegregation Policy change directed at the Military and Jackie Robinson's career in Baseball . It preceded Brown vs. Topeka Board of Education, it preceded Rosa Parks refusing to give up her seat on the bus, it preceded the sit-ins at the crown room at Emery Bird Thayer yet it somehow has been viewed as a film that is politically incorrect. I disagree. The Film is a protest against racism, if you can get past the film setting and get to the stories within the story.Correct me if I am wrong but did not Uncle Remus tell stories that were based on the black experience and weren't they parables much as Aesop's fables are parables, don't they have a moral lesson, don't they have an African tradition and origin. If in fact they were stories told by a black man then it follows that the stories are also told from the black man's perspective and if they are truly coming out of the black experience, tradition, and history then surely they must have been told in the frame of mind that the hero or protagonist was black and if the hero was black than the antagonist must have been white because white was the only antagonist the slave knew. With that in mind if we examine the characters of the stories then our Protagonist Br'er Rabbit is our hero and I believe Uncle Remus's alter-ego, while Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear were the antagonist of the stories. I remember Uncle Remus as a wise old sage and his stories captivating using humor, wit, and irony weaved into his stories to make a point and maybe even poking fun at whitey and with whitey being to self-absorbed, egocentric, myopic, and the one stupid enough to never get the joke.
