I first saw it when I was 14 years old (in 1987, a year after it came out). At that time, my hormones were raging, and frankly I just got off on it. However, I also thought it was a visually beautiful film with a cool soundtrack. Not to mention, Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke are great to look at. I think the acting was decent on the part of both, but stronger from Kim Basinger. You really saw and palpably felt her vulnerability and overall anguish. I personally think it is her best performance to date.My main critique of the movie has always been that it didn't strike me as all that severely shocking in sexual content. Even for 20\/25 years ago, none of the sexual activity that took place struck me, even then, as so incredibly S & M. Most of the stuff they did is stuff that I'd like to do, and I'm a far-cry from being into S & M. The rape scene wasn't much of a rape, and I would argue that LOTS of women, even ones not into S & M, like the idea of being thrown on a table and a hot guy sort of forcing himself on you, especially if it's your boyfriend who you're attracted to but just happen to be mad at for that particular moment. The food in front of the refrigerator -- granted, not everyone gets that playful with sex -- but is it really so evil and dominating\/submissive? Having sex standing up in a clock tower after running up several flights of stairs? Sounds great... Even her dressing up as a man...that seems more dorky than it is domination\/submission. The fight they had with the thugs...didn't seem like something John planned in order to humiliate her or dominate her; it's just something they ran into.In essence, the film always left me thinking What's the big deal? I couldn't even imagine why she'd leave him, based on most of the stuff they did. (SOME things were out of line and scary, but not most...and the things that were a little shocking were things he SAID, not anything they actually did)I recently read the actual memoir by Elizabeth McNeil, and liked it a lot. It's an amazing book. Well-written and didn't strike me as outdated for being written in 1978. I loved it...It even reinforced my view that the movie was not anything jaw-dropping. The book is much more serious about the S & M activity. The movie was done much more like a romance, and that's okay, really. But even if you're going to turn the book into more of a romance, it still could have stood to be a little more faithful to the book as far as seriousness of sexual activity.

The pride that the Maoris have of their culture and history, and the way it is presented in the movie, is very inspiring. The scenes of domestic abuse, of the rape, are still shocking and infuriating. But even though I felt then, as I do now, that this is not something Beth should have let happen, not to her and not to her kids, I found myself now sympathizing with her and gaining some kind of an understanding of why she acts the way she does. Grace's way of dealing with her rape was something that I couldn't understand before, but now I could see her action in a different light, maybe get into her head a little to see what made her do it, beside the obvious reason.This movie shows the audience a different culture, one that is rarely viewed on screen by a mainstream American audience.

I was blown away by the depth of the characters and the emotions that this movie brought out. It is a story about the loss of a cultures identity and their life of disadvantages. The story revolved around a Maori family, and there hard ships living in a poverty stricken Maori enclave in Aukland, New Zealand. They were a people descending from the great Maoris tribe, but had forgotten that. They are a community that is extremely intertwined and face many social and economic hardships. The lack of education seems to be a large factor to the problem , if not the the problem itself. Beth is a mother to many children (most notable Boogie, Nig, and Grace,) and the wife of Jake The Muss. She is trapped in a world of violence, abuse ,and alcohol. She is a strong willed Maori woman that pays for her opinions with beatings from Jake, both verbally and physically. The women in this film are set out to be nothing more than the object of a mans affection and the source for a hot meal. The ironic thing is,that the women see nothing wrong with that, with the exception of Grace. Grace reads and writes and dreams of a better life away from Aukland. The men in this film are always drinking and violent. Jake is a man who is trapped in his own self loathing. It drives him crazy and makes him angry and violent. But, sometimes it's possible to have mixed feeling about his actions,it makes you wonder what his real reasons are for doing what he does. Nig and Boogie, are Jake's and Beth's oldest sons. They both are rebellious and struggle to find there way. They never seemed to get the attention from Jake that they needed, so they sought it elsewhere. They have to part ways in order to find and make there own journey's to find their true and own identities. they do this by going and looking back at their heritage and embracing the past. All the characters personalities are completely different, but yet it brings them all together.

From that point on, until the last few minutes, the movie is a flashback, explaining to the viewer the series of misadventures Cat experienced as she set out to avenge her father's murder, finally getting herself into the mess she was in. In all honesty, I didn't care much for this movie. Fonda's performance as Cat (evolving from a naive young schoolteacher into the leader of an outlaw gang) was pretty good, but beyond that I didn't find much to get excited about, and I cannot for the life of me figure out what it was about Lee Marvin's performance as both Kid Shelleen and Tim Strawn that won him an Oscar as Best Lead Actor for 1965. It's not that he did a bad job, but I certainly wouldn't have thought of it as Oscar-worthy. A dozen other actors could probably have taken the role and done just as well with it. The repeated cuts to Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye singing about Cat's experiences also threw me off, especially when it was so obvious that they weren't even playing the banjos they were holding (they'd be plucking them while there was no sound, then when there was sound they wouldn't be plucking.) Basically, this was nothing more than a series of at best mildly amusing misadventures, with some tired slapstick humour thrown in (especially by Marvin when playing the drunken gunfighter Shelleen) and a weak attempt at developing a romance between Cat and Clay (Michael Callan). Overall, I'd say this was a huge disappointment - which is perhaps explained by the fact that the novel on which it was based was a serious Western that was turned into a comedy for the big screen. It didn't work - at least, not in my opinion.

I will tell you ahead of time, I watch any anime I can get my hands on, so no worries this review is going to be like some of the other clowns commenting on this with things like I had no idea what an 'anime' was before this, har har!. *eyeroll* Anyway, I will say first that this is a little different than most anime I've seen thus far. After watching, this really struck me as a cross between Law and Order SVU and anime, only in this movie, you follow around a pop singer\/beginning actress instead of the cops. No supernatural stuff to be found in here, so no awesome robots or post-apocalyptic societies.Now, I usually love anime, and seeing me giving one a low rating is quite unusual, so why four stars? Let me count the ways - I was paying pretty strict attention, and it makes VERY little sense! When you hit about the middle of the movie, the Mima (the main character the film follows around) is having serious delusions, first seeing herself in many places in her old pop-singing outfit, and later, apparently dreaming of her work as an actress. It quite literally hits a big piece of the movie where it's practically IMPOSSIBLE to tell what's real and what's not. I only wish I was joking.- This anime is dated. They have a bit where Rumi (The girls' manager? Something along those lines) is explaining how to use the internet. Not only is Mima's spoiled whining harsh on the ears, the explanation is painfully simple and grating to anyone who's ever been even in close proximity to a computer.- I've seen a couple commenters say the dubbing is pretty good. I say - not REAL good! Most especially in the beginning, where Mima is singing with the two other members of her pop group CHAM, the dubbing was about half again as good as in the original Godzilla. Needless to say, the voices and the the mouths moving don't always match up.- If you're not fond of characters doing stupid things to further the plot, you may have a real problem with this movie. One point in particular that left me incredulous Mima receives a letter bomb, and her manager's hands are cut up pretty good. Yet...no one calls the police? - I'm not usually one that even tries to figure how how things are going to turn out in mysteries and thrillers of any kind, but the ending is pretty predictable. Needless to say, your first impressions of the characters are probably spot-on. However, in one of the very last frames, the movie tries to throw in one last twist (?), but I fail to see what that was trying to accomplish or imply.Now for the things that earned it four stars - If you're into techno or j-pop (I am, of course), you'll probably find the music in this pretty nifty.- The animation is pretty good. It looks more realistic than in many other anime I've seen, though it's not my personal favorite style.- As you'll recall in the beginning of my review, I mentioned that I'd just caught this on sci-fi. Now, having not seen the original version of this in either the r-rated or unrated version on DVD, I realize that (as usual) the network may have cut some pretty good chunks out of it. However, the editing must not have been too severe, as taking a look at the message board here proves that even if you've seen it on DVD, it STILL doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Either way, I'm giving it a little benefit of the doubt, as I vividly recall the horrible and totally unnecessary edits commonly made to anime. Never mind the fact that one often sees things like this on Law and Order or CSI, but there you go.Finally? I'm personally offended that some people have dared to compare this to an absolutely fabulous anime that came out the same year, Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke. Not only are the two of COMPLETELY different genres, comparing Princess Mononoke to Perfect Blue is like eating a piece of chocolate VS. being stabbed in the eye. No, really.Bottom line - don't waste your time. If it's a crime\/psychological thriller you're looking for, there are vastly better movies. If you're looking for good anime - RUN AWAY. Hands down, this is probably the worst anime I've ever seen, and definitely the one that made the least sense.

It quite literally hits a big piece of the movie where it's practically IMPOSSIBLE to tell what's real and what's not. I only wish I was joking.- This anime is dated. They have a bit where Rumi (The girls' manager? Something along those lines) is explaining how to use the internet. Not only is Mima's spoiled whining harsh on the ears, the explanation is painfully simple and grating to anyone who's ever been even in close proximity to a computer.- I've seen a couple commenters say the dubbing is pretty good. I say - not REAL good! Most especially in the beginning, where Mima is singing with the two other members of her pop group CHAM, the dubbing was about half again as good as in the original Godzilla. Needless to say, the voices and the the mouths moving don't always match up.- If you're not fond of characters doing stupid things to further the plot, you may have a real problem with this movie. One point in particular that left me incredulous Mima receives a letter bomb, and her manager's hands are cut up pretty good. Yet...no one calls the police? - I'm not usually one that even tries to figure how how things are going to turn out in mysteries and thrillers of any kind, but the ending is pretty predictable. Needless to say, your first impressions of the characters are probably spot-on. However, in one of the very last frames, the movie tries to throw in one last twist (?), but I fail to see what that was trying to accomplish or imply.Now for the things that earned it four stars - If you're into techno or j-pop (I am, of course), you'll probably find the music in this pretty nifty.- The animation is pretty good. It looks more realistic than in many other anime I've seen, though it's not my personal favorite style.- As you'll recall in the beginning of my review, I mentioned that I'd just caught this on sci-fi. Now, having not seen the original version of this in either the r-rated or unrated version on DVD, I realize that (as usual) the network may have cut some pretty good chunks out of it. However, the editing must not have been too severe, as taking a look at the message board here proves that even if you've seen it on DVD, it STILL doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Either way, I'm giving it a little benefit of the doubt, as I vividly recall the horrible and totally unnecessary edits commonly made to anime. Never mind the fact that one often sees things like this on Law and Order or CSI, but there you go.Finally? I'm personally offended that some people have dared to compare this to an absolutely fabulous anime that came out the same year, Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke. Not only are the two of COMPLETELY different genres, comparing Princess Mononoke to Perfect Blue is like eating a piece of chocolate VS. being stabbed in the eye. No, really.Bottom line - don't waste your time. If it's a crime\/psychological thriller you're looking for, there are vastly better movies. If you're looking for good anime - RUN AWAY. Hands down, this is probably the worst anime I've ever seen, and definitely the one that made the least sense.

I will tell you ahead of time, I watch any anime I can get my hands on, so no worries this review is going to be like some of the other clowns commenting on this with things like I had no idea what an 'anime' was before this, har har!. *eyeroll* Anyway, I will say first that this is a little different than most anime I've seen thus far. After watching, this really struck me as a cross between Law and Order SVU and anime, only in this movie, you follow around a pop singer\/beginning actress instead of the cops. No supernatural stuff to be found in here, so no awesome robots or post-apocalyptic societies.Now, I usually love anime, and seeing me giving one a low rating is quite unusual, so why four stars?

That's why THE BEACH is probably Boyle's weakest film to date ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"10 December 2007","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Set in 1963, Dirty Dancing is the story of an ordinary American family--a doctor, his wife, and their two teenage daughters--on vacation at a ritzy lakeside resort. The drama begins when Johnny, the resort's well-muscled dance instructor (played by a stunning Patrick Swayze), strides into the dining room where a bevy of waiters are setting tables, and is told by the hotel manager in no uncertain terms to keep his hands off the female guests. The rest of the film showcases Swayze's enormous sex appeal, both on the dance floor and off.And that's why I gave this film such a low rating--it's only skin deep. Baby, the younger daughter in the family, and a fresh-faced idealist, is entranced by Johnny's raw sensuality when she stumbles onto the hotel staff in a distant cabin one evening, bumping and grinding in an orgiastic dance party.When Johnny's dance partner Penny realizes she is knocked up by one of the hotel waiters who dumps her when he knows she is pregnant, Baby borrows money from her father to help the dancer pay for an illegal abortion, which goes badly. Baby's father is then called in to attend the critically ill girl, and she pulls through, but the father, disgusted by the behavior which brought on the girl's condition, insists Baby sever all ties with her new friends.Baby, however, begins lying to her parents--and after days of intense dance sessions with Johnny, starts sleeping with him. Wait--isn't that how Penny got into such deep trouble? The film never asks the hard questions. It's all about titillating youthful sexual appetites through lascivious dance, and then indulging those passions under the guise of young love. This stuff is not just skin deep--it's downright deceptive. Couldn't Baby get pregnant after having sex with Johnny? We are not encouraged to go there. Instead, Baby and Johnny keep on dancing...Watch this movie, and buy into it, at your own risk.

But as we all no, it was a product of the 60s British traditions and humour and a great deal of camp fun. Bringing that to 90s cinema is always going to be a hard task. Yet i feel they pulled if off. Fiennes did the best he could with what was given. Uma Thurman was never a brilliant choice to start with but she wasn't awful, she just wasn't dianna rigg. The script it witty and camp and everything the TV series was. People look at the over acting and the scenes with the mechanical bees and teddy bears and laugh, but have you ever watched the avengers TV series?? it was full of stupid scenes very much the same, i feel this film had the spirit of the original and deserves far more than the 3.4 its given, because its really not that bad. Go and see it and don't listen to the critics! 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 December 2007","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" OK everyone going to see this film must love the original as i do.
