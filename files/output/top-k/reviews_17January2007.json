Anyways, what happens when you only have 20 minutes to recover a lot of money in order to save your significant other's life? We have ourselves a short movie. This kind of concept couldn't possibly work unless you run the complete thing in slow motion or you provide enough backstory to create another film entirely. Despite the circumstances, Tom Tykwer crafts one heck of a film out of a sure-fire failure design. Using a lot of camera shots, tricks, and angles and using a well-written and drawn-out script, Run Lola Run is unique, yet groundbreaking and suspenseful to the very end.Lona Rennt is a German film that picks up from the moment a soccer ball is thrown, and refuses to slow down from the point on. The only moments of slow-down occur in the only moments of backstory, which even then doesn't last long. They are more like little breaks the audience gets to take after surviving the latest heart-pounding sequence of events. Like previously mentioned, the plot is Lola is a tough yet sensitive girl that must find a way to save her boyfriend in 20 minutes or the inevitable will happen. Facing the death of a loved one in 20 minutes, she has to come up with something, fast. And, she has to run&#133;fast.This is easily a film that can be destroyed if given to the wrong hands. Tarantino, Leone, and Martin Scorsese are directors that would have trouble with this idea, since its short and straight to the point, and demands a total lack of long shots. Tykwer on the other hand, handles it so well, that despite the length and the repetitive instances of Lola's run for her life, the movie never becomes tiring. Its even presented in so many different ways, ranging from speedy to slow-motion, to a plethora of camera angles, to even animated sequences. These techniques are all used three times (watch the movie, you'll see why) but never once does it become a chore to go through.Acting isn't exactly a necessity in a film that barely clocks in at 80 minutes and also requires nothing more than a lot of physical stunts, but it gets the job done nonetheless. Our heroine in the story (or is she?), Franka Potente underwent a lot in order to portray her character Lola, and the payoff is great. She sends the movie the unnecessary extra bit of spark that makes the audience root for her all the way, even if her choices aren't exactly worth rooting for. The other noteworthy performance is that of the victim, the boyfriend, Manni. Played by Moritz Bleibtreu, he makes us sympathize with him despite him getting into the predicament in the first place.Bottom Line With a bolt of suspenseful electricity, Run Lola Run presents the conflict within the first five minutes, and then shoots out like a bullet out of an automatic, with no signs of slowing down. With only a few breaks in between, you'll be at the edge of your seat as Lola and Manni attempt the impossible and resolve a major money issue within the length of a sitcom episode. A sitcom episode length of time in the plot being stretched into a feature film is nowhere near easy, but thanks to some plot twists, plenty of action, thoughtful themes, and hyperactive cinematography, Lola Rennt is a must-see. No need to bring food into this picture, because you'll usually be totally out of breath.

For the time, I can see why this film was so famous and sparked many sequels. Here we have the story of a man named Paul Kersey, an architect and has many liberal views on the world. When he and his wife come back from vacation his whole life is turned upside down. After his wife and daughter leave a grocery store near their home, three hoods follow them and rape his daughter and murder his wife. This sparks something in Paul. After noticing that the police were doing nothing to find the hoods who committed this crime, Paul takes the law into his own hands and becomes a vigilante.I really enjoyed this movie. Charles Bronson is always a lot of fun to watch even if it seems that he doesn't put a lot of emotion into his acting. Vincent Gardenia plays the detective who is out to stop the vigilante crimes and he also plays his part well, as always. We even get to see a very young Jeff Goldblum near the beginning of the movie playing one of the hoods.What makes Death Wish such a fun movie to watch is simply seeing Paul Kersey taking the law into his own hands. You really end up cheering him on. He is better then any other fictional type of vigilante because he seems like a really human being. He doesn't run around in a Bat suit or has to cover his identity. He is almost the all American man who has just taken enough of sitting around and feels compelled to do something about the crime all around him.Unfortunately, other then the second Death Wish movie, the rest of them are just jokes. They take away from the seriousness of what this movie was meant to be. Not to say that they aren't enjoyable, if you like seeing Charles Bronson blow people away with bazooka's and take on the mob and what not.If you like this movie you should check out Falling Down.

While his body of work is extensive and spans across 6 decades, his most famous works are definitely the films done in the years from 1954 to 1964, with movies like Rear Window and Psycho becoming huge box-office hits. The enormous popularity of this excellent movies is probably the reason behind the forgetfulness of many great films done before those years, some almost as excellent as the Master's best known movies. The 1953 movie, I Confess, is one of those forgotten minor masterpieces that while not really perfect, still delivers that great mix of suspense and entertainment that made Alfred Hitchcock's movies special.Otto Keller (O. E. Hasse), the caretaker of the Church of St. Marie, murders a rich lawyer while attempting to steal some money to help his wife. Feeling guilty about his crime, he confesses his crime to Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift), a young Catholic priest known for his willingness to help people. The next day, the police is making investigations about the crime, but Father Logan can't reveal what he knows because of the sanctity of the confessional, leaving the police without any clues. However, troubles begin for Father Logan when his religious conviction for the secrecy turns against him when he becomes the main suspect of the crime, and it gets even worse when a dark secret of his past returns to complicate his situation even more.Loosely based on a play by Paul Anthelme, I Confess is a brilliant study of guilt, secrecy and sacrifice, as the plot focuses entirely on Father Logan's ethical problems and the drama unleashed by his desire to remain silent. While this may sound like not too much of a story to built a feature-length film, the story is filled with unexpected twists and turns that delightfully complicate the plot and add a lot of emotion to the plot, specially when the Father's own secrets begin to come to light. Scriptwriters George Tabori and William Archibald made a good job at developing the story, giving enough space for the characters to develop and culminating in a final that, while probably not as powerful as the one from the play, gives a fitting closure to the dark story of a exchanged guilts and secrets.Probably another of the elements that prevent that I Confess becomes better known is the fact that the movie lacks what is commonly known as the typical Hitchcock touches in terms of style. Without too much comedy and a darker tone than his best known movies, I Confess is definitely Hitchcock playing by the rules of Film Noir (pretty much like he would do in another forgotten gem, The Wrong Man, some years later). In many ways, I Confess is an extension of what Hitchcock accomplished in his previous masterpiece, Strangers on a Train, although this time focused on the personal drama inside the Fathe Logan's mind. It's a very subtle film, although it showcases an excellent use of symbolism and the beautiful setting of the City of Québec, Canada.Montgomery Clift is definitely the highlight of the film, as the talented actor was in his prime when he landed the role of Father Logan. Some have criticized his monotone, almost wooden stance, but personally I think that his facial expression perfectly reflects what is going on inside his character's mind. Anne Baxter plays his female counterpart, Ruth Grandfort, a very interesting character that sadly never reaches her true potential due to Baxter's less impressive performance. She was not the first choice for the role, so that fact could have played against her in this film. Another of the film's remarkable performance is given by Karl Malden, as the Inspector in charge of the case. Malden takes the role and gives another larger than life performance, stealing every scene he is in, and almost giving Clift a run for his money.In the end, the element that most damage does to the film is the very fact that it's a Hitchcock film. What I mean is that I Confess is a technically proficient film noir that certainly delivers a huge amount of intrigue and entertainment, but when contrasted to other Hitchcock movies, it's easy to see why it's regarded as a minor masterpiece. Personally, the only real flaw I found in the film was that, while the Catholic theme is very well-represented, the whole affair about the secrecy of confession isn't really explained, so people unfamiliar with the Catholic system of beliefs will find the basis of the plot a bit hard to believe. While this is indeed a somewhat serious flaw, it doesn't detract from the enjoyment the movie provides as one of the best (and most original) films noir ever done.True, I Confess lacks the usual Hitchcock style that has made most of his movies famous icons of cinema, but it still is a terrific film that fans of the Master of Suspense or fans of films noir shouldn't dismiss. It's a real shame that this movie is almost in oblivion, as while flawed, it's one of the most interesting movies by the legendary director, if only because one can see the Master working under a different scheme than what we are used to see in his works. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 January 2007","score":"","review":" Alfred Hitchcock is without a doubt one of the most important directors in the history of cinema, with a career filled with many classic and influential films that have become icons of film-making.

Stewart, also looking fine and youthful brings a charm and snappiness to his role and plays straight to the audience with his wisecracks and observations on high society.The script adapted by Ogden Stewart from the play by Barry is a holler of lightning-fast one-liners and screwy tit-for-tats as the characters all clamber to fool and dupe one another. The principles all run with the dialogue and rap the snappy banter that is only all so uproarious. It represents a sparkling era of comedy that boasts the best comic talents in acting, writing and directing. Comedy of this standard and nutty style will probably not be seen again as society standards have moved on.While some moments remain ludicrous and admittedly plain silly the film is well supported by the peripheral characters including the fine Ruth Hussey. Each of the players jump in the farcical slapstick with vigor and delight. This is a rare chance when ALL the elements of comedy fire on all fronts and the players just hold on tight and run with the laughs. This was a hoot until the madcap finale.

If Hepburn only ever acted in comedy she would still remain one of the greatest actresses of all time.Grant, oozing charm with Hepburn in comedies and later to star as the edgy, so suave gentleman in Hitchcock thrillers, snappily spits out the comic lines and helped by Cuckor, is a fine rapscallion leading man in a superb supporting role. Stewart, also looking fine and youthful brings a charm and snappiness to his role and plays straight to the audience with his wisecracks and observations on high society.The script adapted by Ogden Stewart from the play by Barry is a holler of lightning-fast one-liners and screwy tit-for-tats as the characters all clamber to fool and dupe one another. The principles all run with the dialogue and rap the snappy banter that is only all so uproarious. It represents a sparkling era of comedy that boasts the best comic talents in acting, writing and directing. Comedy of this standard and nutty style will probably not be seen again as society standards have moved on.While some moments remain ludicrous and admittedly plain silly the film is well supported by the peripheral characters including the fine Ruth Hussey. Each of the players jump in the farcical slapstick with vigor and delight. This is a rare chance when ALL the elements of comedy fire on all fronts and the players just hold on tight and run with the laughs. This was a hoot until the madcap finale.

She requests from MGM that she be cast in the starring role only if Clark Gable and Jimmy Stewart can play alongside her. A slick move as the ensemble all warrant howling performances.Hepburn plays the swooning socialite who has a case of cold feet on the eve of her marriage when both her ex-husband and a charming tabloid reporter plonk themselves on her front door. Tracy, - adamant that her marriage should go without a hitch - decides to teach these boys a lesson and and all chaos breaks loose!Hepburn never looked so alluring and bewitching in film.

Having displayed a solid feel for the director's chair with 1971's PLAY MISTY FOR ME and 1973's HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, Eastwood took the reins on JOSEY WALES when he and the original director Philip Kaufman, who still shared a co-write of the script (and had directed 1972's THE GREAT NORTHFIELD, MINNESOTA RAID), ran into some pretty strong disagreements. The end result was one of the best westerns of the 1970s, in critical, commercial, and artistic terms.Eastwood's character is a farmer living out a quiet life in Missouri near the end of the Civil War who is forced to see his whole family and homestead wiped out by marauding Redlegs from Kansas. He joins up with a guerrilla band of Southerners to set things aright. But when the Union betrays those same guerrillas into surrendering and then promptly slaughters all of them, Eastwood takes violent revenge. He soon finds himself of the run at the reluctant hands of his former commander (John Vernon), and a determined Union man named Terrill (Bill McKinney, who played one of the sadistic mountain men in DELIVERANCE). As he heads towards Texas, he encounters a motley group of outcasts (Chief Dan George; Sondra Locke; Paula Trueman), and becomes less obsessed by violent revenge and more interested in helping, going for his guns only when McKinney's Union troop closes in, and bounty hunters come looking for him.In contrast to the Man With No Name persona he codified with Sergio Leone in the 1960s, or the tough cop he personified in DIRTY HARRY, Eastwood's Josey Wales is a man of great courage and sympathy who becomes tired of all the violence he has had to see and to take part in. The vengeance motif is largely played out by the time the film is into its second half, and it only comes back towards the tail end for a brief moment. Those who have tagged Eastwood as a political reactionary, a John Wayne of our time, have certainly misjudged him, as even one viewing of THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES will testify to. He is not interested in being tough for the sake of being tough; he just wants to survive, and he wants those he protects to be able to live in peace. That's why, although the film is unavoidably violent at times, it has a considerable humanity too, and why it remains one of Eastwood's finest films even to this day.

For years I couldn't remember the name of the film or the story, but that scene made it impossible for me to run bathwater while I was alone! Wigged me out for YEARS.
