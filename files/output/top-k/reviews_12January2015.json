This movie has a clear predecessor in the 1950s When Worlds Collide, which has about the same plot, and also in its focus on the human stories of the disaster, owes much to the nuclear catastrophe film On the Beach. My verdict is that, due to its upgraded 1990s special effects, it is clearly superior to the former movie, but due to its really dumb script, it is very inferior to the latter. The plot revolves around an accidental discovery by a high-school astronomy club. Leo the high school whiz-kid (Elijah Wood) notices something out of the ordinary in his telescope and gives a photo to a mentor at the big telescope in Arizona. The mentor concludes that it is a 7-mile long comet headed straight to earth to extinguish all life. The President (Morgan Freeman) covers up the bad news for a year, but a reporter with MSNBC (Tia Leoni) stumbles onto the story and forces his hand into a press conference. The President reveals not only the ELE (Extinction Level Event), but also a plan to stop the comet with nukes on board a space-ship, and it is game-on.If this movie had chosen to be either a action movie like Armageddon or a drama, like On the Beach, it probably would have worked a lot better. The action-sci-fi part is good with cool action scenes and monumental end of the world special effects. It is the best part of the movie.The human drama stuff, however, falls flat. Tia Leoni's and Elijah Wood's characters both are a bit annoying and the drama seems artificial. Maximillian Schell gives it his best as her estranged dad trying to reconnect before the big boom, but something just doesn't seem quite right. A romance between Leo and Sarah, in which Leo marries her at a young age to make her eligible for a survival lottery, has plenty of potential, but the romance has no chemistry and again seems rather artificial. Morgan Freeman is awesome as the President (I think he could be President), but there is not much focus on his part of the drama either--he just stands around looking presidential.This is a big contrast to a movie like On The Beach, where, in response to an end of the world radiation cloud, Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Anthony Perkins and Fred Astaire give amazing performances that seem to take you right to what it would be like if you were faced with a situation like this. In contrast, Deep Impact seems shallow, with a lot of plots and none really given their justice.In some ways, Bruce Willis's Armageddon, which came out in the same year, is a bit more consistent--Willis does not make any attempt at profundity, the movie is just a lot of cool action. Deep Impact might have been better a bit shallower.

All these traits are fanned to a red-hot flame by unscrupulously ambitious former big-city-reporter turned small-town hack Kirk Douglas, looking for his meal-ticket back to the big time. When he lucks into a real-life human interest story about a hobbying excavator who falls down a mine shaft he quickly comes to exploit the situation by dragging out the rescue time, with the connivance of the corrupt local sheriff just coming up for re-election and his contractor digger, to benefit themselves at the expense at the poor victim just waiting to be rescued,The way Wilder builds up the mood is masterful, both at an individual and mass-crowd level.

She's had it, she's tired of just being a wife and a mother, and even just having the supposed easy life of staying home and keeping house for busy artist Dustin Hoffman has sent her into a frenzy of emotions she can't rise above. Yes, she loves her young son (Justin Henry), but that isn't enough. She gave up her career at her husband's request and according to her, thus a piece of herself. When Ted (Hoffman) comes home from a hard day's work, he's still consumed by the events of the day, and can't even hear Streep tell him that she's leaving. Oh, by the way, she adds as the elevator door closes, I'm not in love with you anymore. So with that, an eight year marriage ends (no mention is made of how long they were together prior to getting married), and a new relationship begins for papa Ted that he didn't have before one with his young son Billy.Ted must now learn how to get his kid ready for school, and that means making breakfast, dressing him, and finding his way there before he heads off to the cut throat world of his Manhattan job. Being late for important meetings isn't going to win him any prizes, but overnight, he must stop thinking of just his career and start thinking of what is best for his motherless son. Where is Streep all this time? She turns up later a supposedly new woman and announces out of the blue that she wants custody even if father and son have bonded together to the point of being inseparable.This is a battle to the psychological death between the parents of the adorable Justin Henry, and even when he's being a brat (condemning the Salisbury steak Hoffman made for him and demanding chocolate chip ice cream instead), he's adorable. Father Hoffman can't deal with kid temper tantrums, telling the crying boy demanding his mommy, Well, I'm all you've got!. But to tearful satisfaction of the audience, the two apologize to each other, and now, being motherless doesn't seem like such a bad thing. It's obvious whose side the audience is going to be on when this case goes to court.By this point in his career, Dustin Hoffman was always the best man at the Oscar's, never the groom, and even though he had fierce competition, it was very obvious that he was going to win for his very human betrayal of a man who changes because he has no other choice. There is great debate whether or not Meryl Streep deserved her first Oscar for this because her character of Joanna is a very contradictory character. She's minus the accents, too, of Streep's other Oscar winning characters, as well as minus sympathy as well because, mother or not, she did choose to abandon her son while finding herself, and her sudden desire to disrupt his life certainly is very selfish. But selfish or not, she's all very human, and nobody would deny her access to Billy, just as long as Hoffman's Ted keeps him full time.Jane Alexander offers excellent support as their downstairs neighbor who indirectly gave Streep the courage to leave in the first place. Veteran actor Howard Duff is also very commanding as Hoffman's attorney, while JoBeth Williams has a very amusing cameo as one of Hoffman's dates who has a very embarrassing meeting with young Henry in the hall. (A TCM broadcast of this deleted the sequence since it contained brief nudity, disproving their uncut claim about the movies they show). The musical score is also very memorable, consisting of classical music re-arranged to sound almost new. New York City locales add to the charm of this movie. How can you not walk through central park and think of the few scenes which take place there from this movie? Winning Best Picture the same year over such formidable competition as Norma Rae, All That Jazz, Apolocalypse Now and Breaking Away, this may not seem typical Academy material, but it certainly became very beloved all around. Justin Henry, too, took attention away from younger Ricky Schroeder who had been praised earlier in the year for the remake of The Champ but was pretty much forgotten by Oscar time. In reflection, while Schroeder's performance required a lot of tears and came from a film that had a mixed critical reaction, Henry's performance seemed almost effortless, as if he was living this character, from the moment he exhaustedly goes to the bathroom (realistically not flushing after being finished) to the scene where he sees his mother for the first time in over a year and runs into her waiting arms.

His wife convinces him to go to Chicago and inform the mob boss who wants Jimmy dead.Bruce Willis as a hit-man? Yeah, it seems plausible given his tough guy roles. Matthew Perry as a luckless loser? Yep, makes even more sense (he definitely appeared in a series of odd romances). Together, they make a pretty good combination.While much of this is fairly predictable, it should be. This is not a deep, philosophical film about killing, but a light-hearted jaunt about contract murder and falsifying dental records. Should that be fun? Maybe not, but it is.

Yet of course life has an ugliness we can't dress, but that's not out there, no hat will fix it. It's the constant vexation with things not being just perfect (which is desire for them to be other than they are), a lover who is not always there, a piano player who doesn't fawn over her singing talent. It's not just her of course, at a cafe we hear people complaining about all sorts of things.What underpins this is ego, that self who must be at the center of things, the filmmaker playfully sketches this in a rehearsal scene, where as she sings, with a small pan of the camera we find her singing directly to us as if center stage for an imaginary audience, the center of attention.But there's also, along the way, a bubbly friend who is open enough about things to pose naked for a sculpting class. Another marvelous image here, a naked body which does not have to overthink its place in the room, which can freely let others take away a glimpse that they can chisel into shape, something she can give of her that she doesn't lose.It's all about the view we bring to life, the air of realization through which we see, the appearances we cultivate.

Having lived a day just like this, having taken walks like these with a soldier in the park, bus rides like these through the first day of summer.This is beautiful stuff, more simple but as deep about the life of appearances and consciousness as Hiroshima mon amour.

Add a talented cast led by the gritty yet unassuming Robert De Niro, and you one of the best action thrillers of the 90's.As the film opens, IRA operative Deidre (Natasha McElhone) has assembled a team of former commandos and spies, including Sam (De Niro), Vincent (Jean Reno), Larry (Skipp Sudduth), and Gregor (Stellan Skarsgard) to steal a heavily guarded steel case containing an unidentified object of immense value. The theft is spectacular enough, but the real action comes afterwards, as the team is struck by betrayals from within and above, and Sam and Vincent find themselves working against everyone just to get their paycheck.The term Ronin refers to masterless samurai, men who practice their trade as hired swords or bandits, fighting for money rather than loyalty or honor. And this is a perfect metaphor for the entire film. The people in this picture- hero and villain alike- are in it 100% for the money, and as far as they're concerned, there is little honor among thieves. The sheer number and frequency of double crosses and backstabbings is striking. It's like The Maltese Falcon, only with more factions in play. Even more remarkable is how ruthless many these people are. At one point a main character actually shots at children on a playground- just to make a point! These are folks you don't want to screw around with, and yet they screw each other over again and again.The other thing that makes Ronin stand out is the action; this is after all, a thriller. Bullets and car chases alone do not a good movie make, but the ones here are of such quality that they go a long way. That the staging, execution, and photography are exquisite goes without saying. Just as importantly, the filmmakers know the importance of building up to the action, without completely tipping his hand. By the time the guns come out, the tension will be so thick you can cut it with the proverbial knife, but you'll still be caught off guard by the suddenness and sheer ferocity of the gunplay.The staging of the chase sequences is also worth noting. Two of the biggest mistakes writers and directors make when doing car chases are to use endless aerial shots, or to go cheap and film the entire scene from a pursuit camera. Frainkenheimer doesn't make those mistakes. Instead he underlines the high speeds and frantic action by using frequent cuts and a variety of camera angles, including head-on, tailing, side, and reaction shots of the drivers.And forget the old cliché where the good guy never hits anything except fruit carts and stacks of empty boxes. These drivers ram into medians, sideswipe trucks and walls, and plow straight into each other. Glass shatters, hoods buckle, and if a car goes airborne, you can hear the suspension crunching when it touches down. It also helps that Frainkenheimer directed these scenes himself, rather than leaving it to the second unit director, and that he didn't use a single digital effect. Every wreck and explosion actually took place.I should mention that the acting was excellent as well, especially by De Niro. No-one can remain as nonchalant while firing a rocket launcher from the sunroof of a speeding car, or be ass likable racking up a body count as De Niro. Jean Reno also shines as the jaded Vincent, and Skarsgard is downright frightening as Gregor. If you like action, car chases, or gritty crime movies, you will love Ronin.

The main villain plays an intelligent person but is very oblivious to what is going on, when it should be very obvious if you think about it. His manner of acting and dialogue say I know and understand everything but his actions say I am completely clueless.The movie clarifies that the characters take a number of days to fall in love (which may be enough time to get a crush on someone I suppose), but it only takes a minute of montage in real time so it feels very forced.

Yes I know it didn't go as low as the cheesy, old 1960's Adam West Batman. But it sure comes very close (not to be a hypocrite but I actually enjoyed that series even if it was before my time). I guess to draw towards the younger age demographics, Mr. Schumacher alleviates all the dark rainy gloom that Burton created and made an atmosphere with vibrant colours, booming explosions and scenarios that might keep your attention in tact, but the scenarios just seem to be patted on without any reason or rhyme. I kept saying to myself during the whole process as to why did that scene take place, let alone, what is the purpose of that certain set piece was there making the execution virtually null and void. I mean the plot was already paper-thin, but at least have the set-pieces serve some sort of purpose. Is that so hard to ask? The ultimate poison that Schumacher injected in the franchise was his negligence to implement the psychological aspects that Mr. Burton carried in the previous two installments.

The film seems to segue into another side story as the Caped Crusader (Val Kilmer) is in battle with the notorious coin-flipping killer Harvey Two-Face Dent (Tommy Lee Jones). The city of Gotham has gone through what appears to be a beauty makeover. Gone are the dark and dreary colours brought on by Burton's production designer Anton Faust and Bo Welch.

Opening scenes were actually quite exciting, but then waters down to a formulaic melodrama as Bruce Wayne encountering a psychopathic genius who could very well just be Ace Ventura gone bad, Dr. Ed Nygma (played by the always fun Jim Carrey) who has worked on a diabolical apparatus that reads minds long before he developed the moniker, The Riddler. Nygma joins forces with Two-Face to exploit the entire city Gotham just who is this Batman who seems overwhelmed by playing father figure to an orphaned acrobat named Dick Grayson who later adopted the name Robin and a new love interest in Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman). After a myriad of unriveting confrontations with his adversaries, Schumacher decides the time is right for one last explosive showdown just before the end credits materialize. The ranting doesn't stop here. If you thought the effects, the atmosphere and the production designs were insignificant to the two installments, surely the acting makes it all up right? NOT! The acting also contributes to the side effects of Mr. Schumacher's debauchery to this up until now sprawling franchise. Kilmer is virtually a cardboard cutout here and the feeling of Michael Keaton's interpretation of the reclusive eccentric millionaire has found a restless foot in the grave. It seems that Kilmer was not interested in the role and you can see it from his stoic expressions he just wanted out. Chris O'Donnell was just annoying as Robin and Nicole Kidman was just nothing but window dressing. Tommy Lee Jones looked embarrassing and unconvincing as the evil Two-Face as this is one role that Jones will likely be forgotten.

Michael Gough returns for the third time in the subtle but convincing role as the loyal but weary butler Alfred, but cant implement much chemistry to the stoic Kilmer. There are other little positive tidbits about Batman Forever that doesn't make this movie entirely contrived.

An arrogant thief named Alex Cardo, played by Daniel Bernhardt, gets caught by the police after being setup by his partner. It turns out that Cardo is already a good martial artist, but when he goes to jail, he meets a person with even stronger kung fu, named Sun (James Hong). The rest is pretty straight forward from there. A reformed criminal seeks redemption, a student learns the Ultimate Technique from his master. Said reformed jailbird\/student enters to the Ultimate Death Match tournament to honor his master and gain back his honor. Along the way, we get a lot of new faces (and some old ones as well if you've seen the first movie), a ton of fights, some big bad evil former student, and some pathetic facsimile of a romance happen.Probably the strongest point of this film is the fight choreography and action sequences. I actually believe that when they were brainstorming this film, they decided to make a tournament fighter featuring different styles of martial arts. But they needed something to try and ensure some modicum of notoriety, so they tied it into the languishing franchise of Bloodsport (thanks for Dux getting tacitly outed as a fraud), picked up the services of Pat Murita, and called it good.But back to the point, you see a ton of different styles in this film and nearly all the fights are very well done.

Not much that doesn't echo other remarks. One important point the movie's not really a comedy. Instead it's done with a light touch that creates a tongue-in-cheek effect. Note how neither Newman nor Redford performs very dramatically, instead lightening the mood with knowing smiles. Even Shaw is fairly low-key in his villainy, though appropriately somber throughout. I almost wanted to boo every time he appeared, like one of those old time melodramas. Then too, I'm glad the producers had sense to cast tough-cookie Brennan opposite Newman instead of some glamour puss. In fact, the film shrewdly features no glamour at all, in either the seedy settings or the women. That way, nothing distracts from the elaborate con job or from the three core characters.On the other hand, the intricacies of the con are pretty complicated, while director Hill draws out the runtime with often unnecessary bits of business. But then, a movie featuring two of the biggest names in the business commands a lengthy runtime.

I have been a massive movie geek, and realized I had not seen any of his movies until recent. I haven't been trying to avoid anything of his, it's all coincidence. What better way to start off than with cowboy classic, El Dorado? El Dorado is a remake of the Duke's 1959 film, Rio Bravo, co-starring Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson. Remake is the wrong description for this, due to its very different plot and characters. I would consider this to be a rehash movie. There are similarities in the characters and locations, but that's about it. Rio Bravo is about a sheriff (Wayne) that takes three unlikely men under his wing to stop a band of thugs from helping a criminal escape from prison. El Dorado is about Wayne taking a young man (Caan) under his wing to help his friend (Mitchum) battle a gang of crooks that he would have been a part of. Wayne is the same guy in both movies, but the Mitchum and Caan characters are similar to Martin and Nelson's characters, but more different than anything. I wouldn't say better, just different.What makes El Dorado a great movie right off the bat is that it's not about cowboys on a quest to find a treasure or anything like that. 95% of westerns follow that rule. Because it is about something else, El Dorado is already superior to many. I did mention the story earlier, in a nutshell, but me saying the whole story as simple as possible would be giving away too much. I love movies with stories that cover that much ground. But what makes El Dorado the fun movie that it is that we get to see all these cool and deep characters interacting in very fun ways. There's a few parts in the jail where they are just chilling out. Then action sequences erupt and there's great music behind it all. By only problem? It builds up to a weak ending where the bad guys are supposed to be slayed in a very noteworthy and exciting way. That is the only reason why I gave this 9\/10 instead of 10\/10. Other than that, this movie was awesome in every way.
