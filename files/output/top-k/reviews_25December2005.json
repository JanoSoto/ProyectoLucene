THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME, and SHE LOVES ME all were based (in the central plot about two people at loggerheads in physical life, falling in love through anonymity in pen-pal letters) on Miklos Laszlo's PERFUMERIE. They all had their differences in a secondary plot dealing with the jealousy of the owner of the store towards the hero (his closest employee) resulting in his firing the hero due to a serious mistake by the employer. This was jettisoned and altered in the middle film, but resumed in the Kander and Ebb musical of the 1970s (made into a television version in 1978). But that version actually gave the actual villain a parting shot in his last song, showing he was down, but not out, and would still find a way of getting an undeserved success.When Nora Ephron did her version of the play in this screenplay, the jealousy angle was dumped, and the concentration was on the business antagonism between the hero and heroine (here Tom Hanks as Joe Fox, and Meg Ryan as Kathleen Kelly). Hanks and Ryan do not work at the same store as James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan or Van Johnson and Judy Garland did. Hanks works at a mega book store (Fox Books) like Barnes and Noble. Ryan runs a small neighborhood book store for children, called The Shop Around The Corner (Hanks takes her to task for that name, saying it can't be claimed as a single corporate name). Fox Books is moving into the neighborhood that Ryans's store is in, and she fights it's irresistible push - in vain as it is. In the end not only is she the loser, but members of her staff get hired by Fox Books as well.There are other elements here that do not come out in the original version or the 1949 version. The protagonists don't write letters, but are sending e-mails to each other. Times are changing, and the discovery of a small notice in the newspaper's classified for a pen-pal is replaced by Ryan meeting Fox accidentally in surfing the internet and finding a chat room (a scene we are told of, but never see). In the 1949 film, Garland was pursued (if you will - somewhat weakly) by Johnson's friend and fellow employee Buster Keaton. Johnson was linked (by Garland) to a female friend who was a violinist. Neither relationship was that strong or threatening to the eventual Johnson-Garland relationship. But for the first half of YOU'VE GOT MAIL, Ryan is living with a self-righteous newspaper columnist (Greg Kinnear), and Hanks is living with a self-centered publisher (Parker Posey). We barely knew the families of Sullivan and Garland (we saw an aunt or two that they lived with). Here we know that Ryan's mother is dead, but her grandmother Birdie (Jean Stapleton) is alive and thriving. In fact we learn Birdie is rich due to a stock investment and that she once dated John Randolph, Hanks' grandfather. In fact, we even learn that Birdie romanced one of the most interesting political figures of 20th Century Europe. Hanks' family is developed too, beyond Stewart's or Johnson's (or Ellis's for that matter). Besides grandfather Randolph (about to remarry), we see Hanks' father (Dabney Coleman), who keeps running through wives and never finding the right mate. We also meet Hank's aunt and brother.The film worked well again, and just as the early pairs of couples (Stewart and Sullivan, Johnson and Garland) had good chemistry, so did Hanks and Ryan. This was their third film together (people forget they did JOE AND THE VOLCANO first), and the second film (after SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE) with Ephron at the helm. With all the modernization and story changes, and character histories, and assaults on the concept of mega-stores (check the scene where Hanks hears an inept salesman in the children's book section), Epron managed to show the old warhorse by Mr. Laszlo still had plenty of juice in it to go down well with the public. My guess is that like Lubitsch's original film it will end up a classic version of the story. My wonder is what will be the next version be like.

If you look back at the Bachman Books (Running Man, The Long Walk, Roadwork, Thinner) you notice they have a sealed-in feeling of airlessness and hopelessness about them that is distinct from mainstream King. I realize that we are talking about the guy whose first novel featured a humiliated, blood-covered, emotionally crippled teenage girl slaughtering everyone at her high school prom...but mainstream King always at have characters and plot elements that leaven the grimness of the proceedings a bit, and mostly have endings that offer at least a glimpse of hope and human feeling. Bachman books are just plain mean and always end badly. (BTW, Pet Semetary could have easily been a Bachman book if King hadn't revealed the alias by then. And The Dark Half seems to be at least partially about his Bachman persona.)Thinner was the last Bachman book, and man, with its themes of class warfare, revenge, and death by starvation, it is nasty. So it should be no surprise that the movie follows suit. What is a surprise is that the adaptation seems to be filmed at a TV Movie Of the Week level of talent instead of something worthy of a theatrical release. (These days, something like this would probably go directly to DVD or cable). The makeup work and the striking motif (starving to death in the midst of plenty, a metaphor for the overfed, undernourished American middle class if there ever was one) is all that keeps you watching this misfire. What went wrong? My first thought is that the director was going for the nasty Bachman vibe, but he also somehow sucked all the interest out of the movie with poor casting choices - the actors here (with the exception of Joe Monetegna) simply can't carry the movie. And then he squished the warmth and life out of the rest of the movie with awkward pacing and scene structure. Plus he couldn't leave the plot alone, and his changes don't really help. The script and dialog ought to work, but mostly the movie just lies there. Everything is muffled, dull, airless, and no fun to watch...with the vivid exception of the spectacle of the main character getting....thinner, and thinner, and thinner. As other have pointed out, Thinner is by no means the worst King movie ever made (or even the second worst). And it does have a dreadful, compelling fascination owing to the theme and the careful makeup work. But first time viewers should approach this one with lowered expectations.

Dead Heat is a fun, drive-in type feature with Treat William and Joe Piscapo starring as two cops in the style of something seen in Lethal Weapon. These cops have not done everything by the book and are in the middle of a crime wave where a different pair of armed thugs have been robbing jewelry stores and banks in broad daylight with no fear of being shot down(or having the weakness of being killed with any ease at all). Well, through some investigation, our two protagonists discover that a machine exists that can bring back the dead for twelve hours - and one of the cops gets his and is placed on the machine. Now, we have zombie cop against zombie criminals and one silly, fun, action-packed film on hand. Director Mark Goldblatt never tries to make this film anything more than what it is supposed to be. The actors don't try either, which is good when you have a script that only has so much elasticity. Williams is good in his role, and Piscapo definitely has limited range, but I really thought he did a much better job than his lack of acting gigs since would suggest. One major plus is the core of veteran screen actors with Darren Mcgavin, venerable Keye Luke, and the elder statesman of horror Vincent Price in attendance. Price has a small role but is still able to keep your attention. This was one of his last films. The same for Luke who I always felt was very underrated. Lindsay Frost is aboard as major eye candy. The special effects are interesting to say the least. The make-up used on the criminal zombies has a fake feel like big puppets at some points and at others is pretty good. The scene in a Chinese restaurant is a hoot - a very ridiculous hoot. Dead Heat again is nothing grand or thought-provoking or even scary, but it is a very fun film and should illicit a few laughs.
