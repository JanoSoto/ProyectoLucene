Based on the Stephen King book, it's about a family that moves into a new home. Louis (Dale Midkiff) is the new doctor at the university, Rachel (Denise Crosby) is his wife. Across the street is a friendly old man named Jud (Fred Gwynne), who warns them about the road nearby. As he explains it, the road has taken many lives, mostly pets. When Louis comes face-to-face with tragedy, he learns of a mysterious place beyond the pet cemetery, an old Mic Mac burial ground that holds mysterious powers.The biggest problem is easy to pinpoint Screenplay by Stephen King. Having read the novel, I can tell you that the man hasn't cut a thing from the tome so plot points are quickly introduced and poorly developed because there's a new one right around the corner. The multitude of ideas here really needed a significant amount of buildup and development to be effective and as is, they just aren't and sometimes come off as 100% nonsense. Take for example, the Mic Mac burial ground. It's not a spoiler that this burial ground is not going to lead to anything good. In fact, we learn from Jud that it has a reputation for being an evil place. Why then, does he tell Louis about it, knowing that he will travel there? There are hints that the place has a mind of its own and is able to influence events and people, but there is so little time dedicated to this idea that actually, you are more prone to believing that Jud is simply an evil old man looking to screw around with his neighbor. It's one of the most frightening ideas in this story and it takes a backseat to countless other plot points that don't really go anywhere.There's so much going on it will make you want to run in front of a semi truck. We have the Creed daughter experiencing psychic visions (it wouldn't be a bad Stephen King movie without those), a friendly ghost that tries to influence Louis, back story between Louis and Rachel's father, Rachel's tragic past and family drama time. Each of these plot points end up hindering the story because they take valuable moments away from what would have been character development. There is a character introduced at the beginning of the film. She has a couple of scenes, dies and turns out to be completely pointless in the end. It's easy to see why she was included her death is meant to begin a string of events that make Louis' actions during the climax of the film understandable. That sounds like a good idea, but when you don't care about the characters, it's impossible for the film to be effective.I really wanted to give this movie a shot, but I found so many things that bothered me about it. For example, Louis is a doctor so his wife nicknames him Doc. In fact she almost always calls him Doc. It's like the woman doesn't even know the name of her family members when you hear her say Doc come get your son and other similar phrases. She and her husband do not feel like a couple at all, not only because she nags him all the time, but because it feels like they have never spent any time alone together.Ironically, the film is simultaneously too empty and too full. It is full of useless plot developments that an unbiased screenwriter, one that understands that books and movies are like apple pies and orange marmalade would have cut. Books and movies are very different and can't be written the same way. In a book, having something like hallucinations, visions or ordinary objects turn against their masters can work because you're already visualizing the story in your head. Your mind is doing a lot of the work and when you've been sitting in bed reading for 3 chapters straight, not only does it naturally suck you in because you've been with the characters a long time, but you've gotten to be in their heads and you can actually imagine what is being described to you in a way that works. Movies only usually last 90 to 120 minutes; they're leaner and show you everything without having easy access to characters' thoughts. Stephen King is simply not able to understand this, which is why his screenplays do not work. It also doesn't help that there's some pretty wooden acting throughout. Maybe that was intentional. Bad acting for flat characters? It's a match made in movie hell.I will give credit to the special effects and makeup in the film, which are quite good. Also, for better or worse, Fred Gwynne gives a memorable performance. He comes off as a cooky old man more often than not, but there's something about him that grabs your attention. The rest of the film though, it's a really big disappointment. Compare this film to another one of King's novels turned into a movie, Christine. Both have a pretty far-out premise, but Christine, directed by John Carpenter works because the story is boiled down to its essentials. Pet Sematary is not; overall it's a big mess and you might remember it being scary and disturbing but that's only because you're remembering a few key scary scenes, which come at the very end of the movie and are actually better taken out of context.

He plays the loud month guy that dose you head in and in a strange way I kind of like him, even when I shouldn't, it's like J.K Simmons in Whiplash where in that movie you got Fletcher a mean, ass-hole who you just want to hit but at the same time kind of like him and not fully hate him, and that's basically Kingsley in this movie. Kingsley is always brilliant in every movie but in this I think he really dose shine and in my opinion it's my favorite performance from him.Now for problems My only little nick pick with this movie is the that in some scenes in this movie that was a little bit slow and that's it really.Overall Sexy Beast is a movie that's acted well, directed and shot beautifully and overall a well done film.

He plays the loud month guy that dose you head in and in a strange way I kind of like him, even when I shouldn't, it's like J.K Simmons in Whiplash where in that movie you got Fletcher a mean, ass-hole who you just want to hit but at the same time kind of like him and not fully hate him, and that's basically Kingsley in this movie. Kingsley is always brilliant in every movie but in this I think he really dose shine and in my opinion it's my favorite performance from him.Now for problems My only little nick pick with this movie is the that in some scenes in this movie that was a little bit slow and that's it really.Overall Sexy Beast is a movie that's acted well, directed and shot beautifully and overall a well done film.

Big lovable bloke.The story is about a former gangster who has made a modest amount of money from his criminal career. Happy to put his life of crime behind him, he has retired with his wife Deedee (Amanda Redman) to the sunny bliss of rural Spain, where he lives an idyllic life with his family and a few close friends. But Gary's contentment is ruptured by an unwelcome visitor from his past -- Don (Ben Kingsley), a former associate who has been hired to assemble a team of criminals to rob a heavily guarded bank. Don wants Gary in on the job, and is less than pleased by Gary's unwillingness to volunteer his services. What ensues is a battle of wills between the two men, with Don intimidating, prodding, and manipulating his onetime friend to get what he wants, forever changing the lives of those around him in the process.Jonathan Glazer seems to be like one of those directors that only direct's movies if he really wants to put in his pure passion, his soul and effort to do so, and how I know that is by looking at his other two movies that he made so far and those two movies have proved that he takes time with filming and he only picks the films that's right for him. Sexy Beast is another great example of that.Ray Winstone may play the same character in every movie that his in. Playing the tough angry British guy in every movie his in, but in this that's not the case, he actually played a character...wow.

I've always hated the kind of sentimentality Capra espouses but I cannot deny that he is a great director. There is such sincerity in everything he does that even these themes that reek of over zealous sentimentality can actually feel compelling to an audience that just isn't susceptible to them. For one thing he always casted his films extremely well. 'Mr Smith Goes to Washington' is driven by it's excellent performances that turn these characters with motivations that seem so one dimensional into powerful representations of the optimistic world Capra so believed in. This is compelling despite all it's cartoon eccentricities. The fact is this is the most interesting Capra film. It shows a world that is dark and where Jefferson Smith is the only real idealist in it. It is an achievement equally shared by Capra and his brilliant cast headlined by Jimmy Stewart.Jimmy Stewart is really pitch perfect even when he plays seemingly simplistic characters in these type of films Stewart does have an ability to show the motivations and soul behind the nice guy persona and that isn't an easy thing to do. It's hard to remember his talent because the Stewart persona has become so iconic it's almost a parody. I like this representation. He isn't blatant or loud. There's some unspooling to be done with Jefferson Smith. He's a character that changes a great deal of the course of the film and we get to see that through Stewart's performance. His bright eyed idealism is in tune with the Stewart legend but the best moments from Stewart come when Smith begins to lose that hope. My favorite scene in the film is when he revisits the Lincoln Memorial after he learns the truth about the culture of corruption. Stewart is so good in this scene that he almost makes us forget the film we are watching and expect something tragic. This performance is essential in looking and assessing Jimmy Stewart as a an actor.My favorite performance comes from the great Claude Rains as the hardened career politician Senator Paine. This part could have very easily been a conventional villain especially in a black and white Capra world but Rains is brilliant here because we see that this character is more than appearances. He isn't black and white and like many men like him we get the feeling this character has repeated the lies until he believes them. I love the build up on Raines face as he listens to the classic filibuster ending. The writing rightly shows that men like Jefferson Smith come to Washington all the time with idealism but they end up becoming like Paine through compromise. Raines shows this. We can't hate this man. That he finds redemption in the end shows the best qualities about the American ideal that Capra loved. There's a lot of goofy stuff here. It's not a film that hesitates to engage in the most blatant over the top melodrama. It's also undoubtedly a piece of propaganda. The America in this film unfortunately is the concoction of storytellers and myth makers like Capra. Capra makes us believe and hope in it though. It's entertaining and silly but the sincere way it is told and acted captured the attention of a cynic like me. It's grade A 'Capra corn'.

He turns out to be crude unconventional rebel rouser and a real problem.With a story as zany and morbidly themed as this, Tim Burton was the only logical choice, naturally the man for the job. This film also brought us one of many wonderful collaborations with the musical genius Danny Elfman. A side to Michael Keaton that I had never seen before was revealed through his character, it added a new depth to his skill in acting. While I did enjoy the overall idea of the strange and unusual film, it was far from perfect. The makeup was exquisite which it deservingly won an Academy Award for, but some of the other effects looked straight out of fake looking theme park attraction. It had the meticulously detailed diorama and the up close version that was even more fascinating when they switch over to that world, yet they also had ridiculously cheesy characters that brought the overall appearance down. I thoroughly enjoy stop motion animation but it's presence in much of the film seemed out of place and unnecessary.To be honest, I am surprised that this film is so popular. It seems like a film that would appeal to very few, yet it draws people in. This movie made it on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Greatest Comedies. While I did find some parts amusing, a lot of the humor was really corny. The singing scenes were simply awful and I found Beetlejuice more offensive and annoying than comedic. The story also seemed to not be very focused. We had about seven main characters and no sense of direction. While I did love some aspects of it, I found more of it to just be disappointing.

It's something intangible, maybe the overall grungy look of the film, the simple story, the shocking primal violence or the ingenious plot but it grabs you, drags you to the edge of your seat and never lets go. In a crime-filled ghetto in South Central LA, the Street Thunder gang swears bloody revenge against a father who dared to stand up against them. Seeking shelter he runs to Police Precinct 13, which is about to close down. Only a skeleton crew of Lieutenant Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker), Captain Chaney (Henry Brandon) and two secretaries, Leigh (Laurie Zimmer) and Julie (Nancy Loomis) remain. A prison bus drops off three prisoners at the station because of a medical emergency just as the gang begins its attack on the building. The power lines are dead, the electricity is gone, there is no backup and the officers are forced to trust the convicts with their lives.Like I said, there's something almost otherworldly about the film that gets you right away. This is a made-for-cheap movie and you can tell at times, but it's very suspenseful so you don't care. The way the zombie-like gang members relentlessly assault the building, the way they slowly pick off one hero after another and the way they manage to prevent the officers from escaping feels raw and real. There are no moments of fancy shooting or heroism, it's just desperate people shooting at anything that moves near the windows of the building and praying that the tide will eventually stop. When a glimpse of hope you still don't know if things are going to ease up, which made it even more intense for me. Is the movie going to give me a break from this tension, or is it going to be like real life, where more often than not it's your own wits that are going to be the key to your survival? As the clock ticks down, the tension inside the station keeps getting higher and higher. Maybe if they can make it to the break of dawn, the gang will dissipate and return to whatever hellhole spawned them. Maybe. The raw immediacy of the violence and the shocking deaths throughout the film hit you like a slap in the face. This movie, in the way that it is cheap and animalistic reminds me of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. If those movies featured big special effects, a ton of gore and recognizable actors in a slick setting, it would be missing that palpable terror that you get from something as simple as the sound of a garbage can falling over in a dark alley as you're walking home alone on a quiet night. The fact that Assault on Precinct 13 is so simple in its premise makes it feel genuine and makes it easy to relate to. I got a real kick out of just listening to the movie too. It's all set to an incredible score by John Carpenter, who also directed, edited and wrote the film.When I first saw the movie, I didn't really know what to think. It was just so unusual to see the abundant violence and while I found it very suspenseful, I wasn't sure if I liked it. After discussing it with a friend and hearing the reasons why people liked it so much though I became hooked. The way the film introduces horror movie-like violence into what should be a dramatic crime thriller, it just catches you so off-guard that you can't get it out of your head. And that score! Little details throughout too, like the way the Precinct is actually labeled Precinct 14, the same way that hotels label their 13th floor 14 to avoid bad luck and the fact that despite being so lean it still manages to throw in a couple of good laughs sold me. Like many of John Carpenter's films, it's a film you really need to watch twice to appreciate but trust me, it's worth it.

I had heard a lot about this film, mostly about some of the more grisly details, but I was surprised to find how emotional and thrilling it was to watch nonetheless. The plot concerns a Uruguayan plane flying over the Andes. The passengers are rugby players in their early 20s and their coaches on their way to Chile. Suddenly, the plane crashes. The pilots are dead, the radio is useless, the supplies are scarce and it is very very cold. The survivors must find a way to survive against all odds, hoping that someone will find them in this frozen wasteland.If you've heard of this film, it's probably because of the cannibalism involved so I'm going to address that part first. Your instinct is probably to think that either the survivor situation turned into a Lord of the Flies type of thing where people started going crazy and eating each other, or that this is going to be something that borders on a horror film, with people's intestines being strung up over a fire like sausages. That isn't the case.Let me break down the scenario for you The plane has crashed and there is very little food. People are eating a square of chocolate and a thimble of wine daily to make supplies last. Our heroes are scrambling to keep warm. People are dying from their injuries or from disease. Morale is way down and hope seems completely lost. Eventually, someone comes up with the idea of eating the bodies of those who have died. There's a big theme of religion in this film so some argue that once the soul leaves the body, there's nothing left but meat. Others argue (pretty sensibly) that it's an offense to the human body to even think of this. After some thought being put into it, some begin to relate the idea of giving up your flesh to save your friends as something akin to Jesus Christ telling his apostles that the bread they are eating at the last supper is his flesh, given up to save humanity. It's the most shocking part of the story, but it's not just a gimmick, it's a testament to the human will to survive.There's a lot more to this film than just the cannibalism, it really is a story about a group of being that refuse to give up hope. These are not soldiers on a mission that went wrong, or wildlife trackers used to doing whatever it takes to get back home, they're ordinary people. Surviving is about more than just finding food and shelter, it's about getting organized, keeping busy, finding ways to cope with the stress they're under. I liked seeing characters that were just as smart as me. Between the group of people there, you have some ingenious and creative minds that simply refuse to give up. Just on the level of ingenuity you have to applaud these people because you know a lot of people would have just given up.What's so exciting about the film is that these feel like real people. Usually in bad survival movies you always have one random lunatic thrown in the mix. A guy that wants to seize all the power for himself, that will go on a rampage and kill people he feels are slowing down the group or goes all rapist on the one female character because so many screenwriters feel the need to have a villain in the film. It isn't the case here. The enemy is despair and the mountain. The heroes are the survivors. It's a test of endurance, a battle of wits and a tremendous underdog story. The film juggles a lot of characters but you do feel like you get to know the key ones and you get a feel for the group as well. As the number of survivors dwindles I did get emotional about it. I sort of knew where the movie was going, but that didn't make it any less powerful to me.Initially I didn't have any problems with the film at all, but in retrospect I do have to surrender to the fact that despite the film being consistently exciting and kind of awe-inspiring. Alive doesn't really capture the full effect of the story. One might argue that it would be impossible to transfer the gravity of such an event into a 2-hour film, but if there's a flaw, that's it. Because these are actors that the director chose not to starve and because you can't really convey the utter despair you would feel after weeks of being stuck in the wreckage of a plane, surrounded by dead bodies it does feel like there is something missing. That said, it's as good as it's going to get The performances are solid, the special effects are terrific, there's real gravity in the situations. I found it to be thrilling, moving and fascinating to watch. The premise of Alive sounds ghoulish, but this is not a gimmicky exploitation movie, it's a stirring adventure and a drama whose story will stick with you.

Maybe in anyone's. And yet it also has a charmingly offhanded feel, like something jotted down after a strange dream as it was fading. Nobody seems to have been trying too hard, a common problem in later Burton projects. It builds slowly, one of those movies where the central figure doesn't really appear until deep into the runtime. Like the shark in Jaws or E.T. in E.T., we want to see Beetlejuice, but the movie smartly holds him back, showing only teasers before the big show.There's plenty to focus on in the meantime. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are likable guides to the world of the dead, a wry bureaucracy that's also playground for Burton's creature creation and makeup departments. The movie could work as satire if it wanted to, something like Terry Gilliam's Brazil set in H.P. Lovecraft's New England. There are waiting rooms and labyrinthine corridors of the dead civil service and a manual for the newly deceased. To go between worlds, Baldwin's character must take a shovel to the foam grass and plywood ground of his scale model of his town, and it's tempting to search this for parallels to the tacky redevelopment going on in the dead couple's home. But really, the whole conceit is too intriguing and lighthearted to serve as earnest commentary or sharp-edged ridicule. The movie speculates that, really, being dead isn't so bad if you can just learn to work the system and get along with people. Being alive isn't so bad either, as long as you don't trample heedlessly over the dead. Having seen the fun that Baldwin and Davis's characters are having after death, it's easy to relate to Winona Ryder's goth girl character, who can see them and decides she prefers them to her snobbish and striving parental units.A fair amount of plot is squeezed into the movie's 90 minutes, but it all boils down to the question of when somebody is going to say Beetlejuice three times and bring Michael Keaton's fast-talking con man out of the scale model and into the real world. Even if you can't catch everything he says&#x97;he speaks in clipped grunts with a highly variable cadence&#x97;you'll walk away impersonating him. This character, from his clothes to his growl to his lurching and reeling body movements, is a touchstone of movies not unlike the the Tramp in the 1910s and Jack Sparrow in the 2000s. Beetlejuice is a villain, but that's just a slight tweak. There's a line of evolution (not to say improvement, since they're all great) through these male, clownish, unlucky, gregarious, vagabond immortals (it is not to be thought that the Tramp aged between 1914 and 1936.) Keaton is so in tune with his creation that he doesn't need a lot of screen time to make a lasting mark on the culture, but the movie is smart enough not to cheat him out of a grand sequence in the final act anyway.Oddly though, by the time the finale comes around, the high point has already been reached. And it doesn't involve Beetlejuice at all. It's the scene where the living characters become possessed and dance around a dinner table lip-syncing Harry Belafonte's calypso song Day-O. Catherine O'Hara shines here, acting with every face muscle and every body muscle but keeping them totally separate. The glamorous costume clothes, the blue lighting in the room, the bizarre sculptures in the background&#x97;this scene is an ingenious fusion of styles held together by Burton's pop-art sensibility. If this were all the movie had, it would be worth watching. But Beetlejuice is a series of original moments like this. It is so much fun, and over too soon.

The actors cast for each role are absolutely stellar and really pull you into the wild west. The cinematography is also outstanding. Closeups of faces coupled with dramatic lighting and atmosphere make every scene a treat. The action sequences are intense and the story is very well written. That being said I do not believe it ranks more than an eight. As a disclaimer, I am not a western aficionado so this might be par for the course. I found many sequences of the film boring. The opening scene is 10 minutes long and nothing is really happening, just a creaky old windmill. I understand that sequences like this build atmosphere, but this movie could have been 15-30 minutes shorter. Also some entire sequences were not shown which would have reduced a lot of confusion later in the storyline. A few really small things stood out to me also. Like Cheyenne cuts his face shaving and then minutes later there is no cut. Sometimes the audio is out of sync ( I was watching the 2011 remastered version ) when people are talking.Overall the positives really outweighed the negatives. When you watch a film from the 60's you sort of expect these kind of things. The superior acting, directing, and storyline make this an outstanding film.

In fact, I would rate this as one of the best Disney films of the 1950s--every bit as good as Peter Pan and Cinderella. So why is this? Well, I think the biggest reason is marketability. If you are the Disney Corporation, it's easy to make and market toys and stuffed animals for many of their films but this really was never done much with Lady and the Tramp. Most folks are most likely to want to spend their money on Mickey watches, Minnie stuffed animals or dressing their girls up as Disney princesses.

While I LIKE the film, the single biggest weakness is its animation. It's good but not at all of the same quality as earlier artistic triumphs such as Pinocchio, Bambi and Peter Pan (among many others). So don't try to tell me that The Jungle Book is Disney animation at its best. It's a pared down form of animation--done with copy machines like 101 Dalmatians. I am NOT complaining about the use of Xerox machines instead of hand-drawing every scene but it did tend to make the films look a bit rougher. After all, Disney had to save money as production costs were skyrocketing and the public seemed to be embracing cheaper animation (hence the rise of UPA and Hanna-Barbara Studios).As for the rest of the film, it has two big things going for it. First, the songs are mostly very, very good. You cannot hear Bare Necessities without bouncing along with the tune and several other songs are just plain fun. And, this brings me to the second reason- -the movie, over all, IS fun. You simply cannot watch it without smiling and enjoying yourself. Well done overall.
