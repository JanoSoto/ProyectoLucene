They're expecting Rocky or Never Back Down. Something along those lines. The truth is, of all the various plot lines in Fight Club, the fighting portion is probably the most brief. Fight Club is about fighting, but not physically. It is about fighting against society. What people tell you to do. Who they tell you to be. What to eat. How to sleep. Where to go. These are all things society tells us. Fight Club strikes a place in my heart with these ideas. I understand, and I agree. Fight Club is the most relate-able film I have ever watched, and will always be one of my favorites. David Fincher is quite possibly the most talented director of his time, and it definitely shows with Fight Club. The cast is also astounding. Every casting choice was spot-on in my opinion, especially Edward Norton's. I can't imagine anyone else playing that part. Of course the twist-ending shocked me, and also rewards repeat viewings, as you can find clues throughout the rest of the film. Over all Fight Club is and will always be one of my favorite films, and will get slightly better with each viewing.I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

Being the Halloween season, leaves falling and trees getting bare and melancholy at twilight, I found the combination of a creepy old hotel room and this cheesy flick a perfect combination. What made it more surreal for me was the fact that I had stuffed foam earplugs into my ears to block out the noise through the paper thin walls. I watched this remake of House on Haunted Hill without having to endure the undoubtedly stupid dialogue (that was a no- brainer) or the gratuitous scare soundtrack and simply watch the cinematography and the actors faces.I don't think there was much good acting going on, though Geoffrey Rush does well as a creepy lounge-lizard type. I caught a few lines here and there so I got the general drift of the story. Peter Gallagher had entered the downward slop of his iffy career. He is slaughtered horribly at the end which is a fitting end for him. Taye Diggs provides some male sex appeal but has two facial expressions... bewildered and bug-eyed and sexy come-on-baby.The bimbos, for such is what they are, are portrayed by two, count 'em, two busty blondes. One, Ali Larter, seems to have some acting ability, the other Bridgette Wilson, does not. The latter is slaughtered even more horribly than Peter Gallagher, and we don't care.Some bit player has his face bitten off and his head emptied like a broken chocolate Easter egg, and someone named Chris Kattan spends lots of time scarfing down bottles of whisky. He dies oddly, as does the brunette bimbo played by someone named Fanke Janssen. They both get sucked up into some kind of creeping cobweb with tentacles. I think Fanke plays the Evil that inhabits the house but don't hold me to that, I don't care.This flick has absolutely nothing akin to the much-loved Vincent Price version made in 1958 which possesses all the charm of the innocent Rank\/Hammer years. This 1999 remake takes place in something that resembles Bat Man's high tech Fritz Lang Castle on top of a Transylvanian craggy peak by the North Sea, but the actors are all glib, vulgar American idiots, excepting Geoffrey Rush though he appears to be trying to be like them in this early film performance before he got famous.The f\/x are very good, in their limited way. The cinematography has catchy little weird moments when the film is sped up. The sets are OK but most of the action takes place in a great manner hall with a great big bar alternately with the maze-like basement.The stupid characters keep returning to the same underground mad scientist laboratory where they all get knocked off one by one, except for the black guy, the smart blonde bimbo and Geoffrey Rush who's fate is dropped unceremoniously in to limbo by the script's failure to come to a proper ending. Could the dim-witted producers have truly envisioned a sequel? Who cares.I'll never see this entertaining time-waster again unless I stumble upon it at future Halloween AMC festivals. So grab a bottle of gin, rent a room at a creepy urban hotel in a second tier American Northern industrial city on a wet, dark autumn night and have fun.

It covers the 'serial killer' phenomenon from all possible angles - from the killings themselves and the motives of the killer, to the manhunt and the effects it has on the agents tracking the killer. Each of these four angles could themselves be the sole premise for such a film and it's to Mann's credit that he not only manages to deal with each of these angles in a substantive manner but also skilfully weaves them together into a coherent story.The film moves at a steady pace and, while always conveying the urgency of the characters' actions, it never feels rushed. The process of tracking the killer is shown to us in meticulous detail right down to the unspoken rivalry and\/or contempt that the different branches of the law enforcement system have for each other. And it's this last point that touches on that which makes Manhunter so clever and in my opinion better than the book itself.Everything important in Manhunter is subtly hinted at so it's left up to the audience to infer Graham's ability to track serial killers (he's half-way there himself); relatedly, Graham's motives for choosing Lounds to lure the killer (whether he was aware of them or not); Dolarhyde's disgust\/insecurity at his own physical appearance (and the root of his desire to kill). This is the true brilliance of Manhunter. Rather than force-feeding the audience, Mann recognises that the characters in this film are driven by their ability or inability to deal with their own psyches. The subject matter is therefore subjective and should never be clear-cut enough so that it can be explained in black and white.For those who say that there was too much focus on Graham and that the book focused mainly on the tooth-fairy, I will remind you of the film's title and to recognise the differences between this title and the book's. Mann quite rightly went his own way with the film. I've always felt that there's very little artistic merit in reproducing a book in film form - that's one step up from listening to a book read out on a tape.While on the subject of reproducing the book in film form, I'm unfortunately obliged to mention the more recent Red Dragon film. I noted that this far inferior film actually has a higher rating than Manhunter and it makes me laugh that a film so formulaic, coarse, and obvious (on all levels) should be held in higher esteem. But I suppose it stands to reason that if babies like drinking formula they want the same thing from their films.Manhunter is not just a technical masterclass in direction and writing but also in acting. Each character is fully drawn out by the actors and they each relate to the different characters in consistently different ways. Peterson has never been better as the introspective lead investigator who innately empathises with these killers and so understands how their profound insecurities can lead to murder. The progression of his character throughout the film is believable and quite expertly conveys to us his desperate attempt to separate himself from 'his man'. Farina is, as always, brilliant and as much as I'm a fan of Scott Glenn, the former's Jack Crawford is the grittier and more hard-edged. With every glance and eye-movement, Farina brings to bear his first-hand knowledge of what it is to be a cop doing his job under time pressure.Standing out from this excellent ensemble is of course Brian Cox as Lecktor. While there is some merit to Anthony Hopkin's unfortunately more renowned portrayal of the same character, his is undeniably a caricature of a serial killer and, therefore, not realistic at all. A serial killer must appear to be, by definition,a very normal person - that's how he manages to kill a 'series' of people as opposed to just one and then being caught! My problem with Hopkin's Lecktor is that he is quite clearly not fully there in the head and so even the rawest recruit from the FBI down to the Cub Scouts would be able to pick him out as suspect no. 1. Cox gives us something entirely different. His Lecktor is smart, charming, and beneath the surface empty, devoid of sentiment and compassion. Again, it's to Mann's, and the actor's credit that, by the time his three scenes are done with, we have an implicit feeling as to what may be driving this Lecktor as well as an uncomfortable liking for him.Three stand-out sequences to look for 1) the 'walk-through' of the tooth-fairy's letter through the forensic process. Not a quick, flashy cut in sight. Instead we have a patient almost soothing series of scenes that convey exactly what the different forensic specialists do better than any film before it or since (yes, they each have their own departments and there is not one indication that Jimmy Price and co. carry a gun, let alone go tracking down the killers themselves!). 2) Graham's visit with Lecktor. A dream-like sequence where the two play the best mental game of chess I can remember seeing in a film. 3) Dollarhyde encountering Reba. Michael Mann at his best shows us in three scenes how the fantasy-driven psychosis of a serial killer can be shattered to the point that the real person beneath is partially and briefly exposed.File under 'Masterclass'.

And it's this last point that touches on that which makes Manhunter so clever and in my opinion better than the book itself.Everything important in Manhunter is subtly hinted at so it's left up to the audience to infer Graham's ability to track serial killers (he's half-way there himself); relatedly, Graham's motives for choosing Lounds to lure the killer (whether he was aware of them or not); Dolarhyde's disgust\/insecurity at his own physical appearance (and the root of his desire to kill). This is the true brilliance of Manhunter. Rather than force-feeding the audience, Mann recognises that the characters in this film are driven by their ability or inability to deal with their own psyches. The subject matter is therefore subjective and should never be clear-cut enough so that it can be explained in black and white.For those who say that there was too much focus on Graham and that the book focused mainly on the tooth-fairy, I will remind you of the film's title and to recognise the differences between this title and the book's. Mann quite rightly went his own way with the film. I've always felt that there's very little artistic merit in reproducing a book in film form - that's one step up from listening to a book read out on a tape.While on the subject of reproducing the book in film form, I'm unfortunately obliged to mention the more recent Red Dragon film. I noted that this far inferior film actually has a higher rating than Manhunter and it makes me laugh that a film so formulaic, coarse, and obvious (on all levels) should be held in higher esteem. But I suppose it stands to reason that if babies like drinking formula they want the same thing from their films.Manhunter is not just a technical masterclass in direction and writing but also in acting. Each character is fully drawn out by the actors and they each relate to the different characters in consistently different ways. Peterson has never been better as the introspective lead investigator who innately empathises with these killers and so understands how their profound insecurities can lead to murder. The progression of his character throughout the film is believable and quite expertly conveys to us his desperate attempt to separate himself from 'his man'. Farina is, as always, brilliant and as much as I'm a fan of Scott Glenn, the former's Jack Crawford is the grittier and more hard-edged. With every glance and eye-movement, Farina brings to bear his first-hand knowledge of what it is to be a cop doing his job under time pressure.Standing out from this excellent ensemble is of course Brian Cox as Lecktor. While there is some merit to Anthony Hopkin's unfortunately more renowned portrayal of the same character, his is undeniably a caricature of a serial killer and, therefore, not realistic at all. A serial killer must appear to be, by definition,a very normal person - that's how he manages to kill a 'series' of people as opposed to just one and then being caught! My problem with Hopkin's Lecktor is that he is quite clearly not fully there in the head and so even the rawest recruit from the FBI down to the Cub Scouts would be able to pick him out as suspect no. 1. Cox gives us something entirely different. His Lecktor is smart, charming, and beneath the surface empty, devoid of sentiment and compassion. Again, it's to Mann's, and the actor's credit that, by the time his three scenes are done with, we have an implicit feeling as to what may be driving this Lecktor as well as an uncomfortable liking for him.Three stand-out sequences to look for 1) the 'walk-through' of the tooth-fairy's letter through the forensic process. Not a quick, flashy cut in sight. Instead we have a patient almost soothing series of scenes that convey exactly what the different forensic specialists do better than any film before it or since (yes, they each have their own departments and there is not one indication that Jimmy Price and co. carry a gun, let alone go tracking down the killers themselves!). 2) Graham's visit with Lecktor. A dream-like sequence where the two play the best mental game of chess I can remember seeing in a film. 3) Dollarhyde encountering Reba. Michael Mann at his best shows us in three scenes how the fantasy-driven psychosis of a serial killer can be shattered to the point that the real person beneath is partially and briefly exposed.File under 'Masterclass'.

It's one of the first science fiction films ever made and it marks the beginning of a trend of using the sci-fi genre as a medium for social commentary. Metropolis is set in a futuristic city of the same name as the film. In this city there is a significant divide between the working and upper class. The working class labors endlessly underground, keeping the flourishing city above ground running for all the prosperous and wealthy. These two factions of society see themselves being forced closer when the son of the city's mastermind falls in love with a prophet like woman of the working class. This societal unrest leads to chaos and Metropolis begins to fall apart. The film is ripe with socio-political commentary and all takes place in an immaculate setting that absolutely mystifies.Metropolis is a fascinating film to watch, thinking about it in relation to its time period. The film displays incredibly groundbreaking originality and this film deserves all the credit it gets in setting up the genre of science fiction for the years to come. It is much like Fritz Lang's film he made four years after Metropolis called M. M was the first serial killer film ever made and will always be the root of the lengths at which the genre has traveled since. Metropolis does the same for the sci-fi genre.It is also incredible to see just how much this movie is able to do with what little it is given. 1927 was still the early beginnings of film. The first annual Academy Awards wouldn't be till the following year. And, obviously, Metropolis is a silent film. And yet with such heavy limits on what it can do, the film accomplishes so much more than a lot of films today. The film is fueled by a fascinating story and characters, yet visually it is amazing as well. Fritz Lang was revolutionary in his direction style and Metropolis emphasized this style beautifully. Even in shoddy black and white film, the architecture of this futuristic world is mind boggling and exemplified incredibly by lighting and camera work. There are some incredible moments in this film where you forget you're watching something that was made over eighty years ago. Most surprisingly, however, is that this film actually has special effects. There is one stunning and immaculate scene set in a laboratory where a robot is transformed into the form of a human girl. The scene is equipped with whirring lights and lightning bolts. Of course it is backed only by an orchestral score, which does suit the entire movie very well, heightening the grandeur and drama. For 1927, the visual aspect of Metropolis is astounding.Any time you think of timeless classic, Metropolis is one of the first films that should come to mind. Who knows where the science fiction genre would be, or if it would be at all, today if not for this film.

Murnau tried to keep this horrifying truth from the public.All saints fools! i was lying. but you know every time i see the original silent movie 'Nosferatu' by Murnau, i can almost believe it. whatever that evil thing Max Schreck was, he certainly didn't seem like an actor. he didn't even seem human. that has got to be one of the scariest silent film horrors i've ever seen. it gave me nightmares when i saw it as a kid on PBS.as for the Johnny Malkobitch movie. i wuv it. it's such a great movie and Malkobitch and Willem Dafoe are so deliciously ( enough to eat) good in this. in fact the Academy Awards should have given Dafoe the supporting actor award. he was the best that year. at least those blood suckers at the Academy Awards nominated him. but he deserved to win. and the acting genius Malkobitch, is always a plus in my book.everything about this beautifully done horror\/comedy, is done in the spirit of old horror movies from the 30's and 40's. the style reflects brilliant horror directors like Todd Browning and James Whale.this movie is so eerie and sinister but also very funny.

On the contrary though, it is a classic film that anyone would love and it is to me the grandfather of clichés. First off saying someone doesn't have a soul is clearly cold in my opinion because maybe they are literary, don't watch movies or just didn't understand it and they don't need to be penalized for it. It's an old film noir with really great dialog and amazing acting ( ahead of it's time) and it brings in what most cinema's have today, the art of clichés. First of all the main character Rick is a prime example of a tough guy, not buff, but he proves muscles don't make the man. Then you have Ilsa, the love of Rick's life and she bring the acting game up well. Now Ilsa is married to a guy named Victor Laszlo, and things get very complicated as the German police start to threaten throwing him in an isolation camp and you just have to see it for yourself. It starts with the atmosphere as the Warner theme plays and the map of Casablanca fades in, which loads of films used a lot later and gives that it is an action adventure romance. Next is the dialog, which strongly is by far the best I've heard in a movie to date which adds both mystery, romance, drama and most important humor which is kind of lacked in movies today. To continue we have the battle of the instruments (used in comedies), the mild bar fight which looked incredibly stunning for 1943( though it only lasted about 40 seconds) and finally a signature in westerns, the who shoots first duel at the very end which was fast paced but timed and played out very well. All in all a great film and as Rick said  This looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship. It's worth it.

I couldn't help it, but my reaction to that, because I'm in the midst of watching and reviewing the original Star Trek episodes in order on this board, was 'Fascinating'.When I first saw this film during it's original theatrical release, I recall being somewhat let down by it's conclusion. The story seemed to have what I considered a contrived ending. Watching it once again now, I have a wiser and deeper appreciation for the character of Prot, the shattered Robert Porter who subsumed his identity following the trauma of losing his family and exacting a revenge totally inimical to his true nature. Kevin Spacey is eerily brilliant in his portrayal of Prot, with a calmness of spirit and purpose that comes across as not only realistic, but oddly comical when the situation calls for it.All that considered, one still requires a certain leap of faith to make the picture work. I'm thinking here of Prot's ability to precisely pin point the location of K-Pax to the satisfaction of the scientists. There's no way to explain a million to one shot like that in the course of every day events. And of course, there's no way to explain the disappearance of Bess. Yet, the three tasks given Howie (David Patrick Kelly) were a wonderful sub-text to carry the picture forward, and brilliant in it's simplicity.

There's millions of dollars in gold just waiting for some military enterprise. Clint Eastwood plays a straightlaced GI who decides to turn soldier-of-fortune when he discovers this stash of bullion is inadequately guarded just 30 miles beyond their advance. The post D-day German defences are crumbling, and in the confusion he and his team might just pull-off the perfect crime.Right from the outset, this is a great action movie. Clint and Telly's outfit find themselves caught-up in fierce combat. There's tremendous pyrotechnics here and what look like real Tiger tanks, not disguised American hardware. It's tense, vigorous and exciting stuff, but with a thread of ironic comedy all the way. Each of the principal characters is simply, but clearly stamped. They're flawed, likable and we care about them - as we should. Using a couple of 'specimen' gold bars, Eastwood's character co-opts and bribes whatever and whoever he needs to succeed in the caper, inadvertently shortening WW2 in the process.Throughout the movie there is some of the most splendid wartime action drama in any work of its vintage. Yes; the Germans are slaughtered wholesale as usual - but who cares? There is also one of the most entertaining close-quarter tank encounters of just about any movie - including the epic 'Battle Of The Bulge'. Sutherland's solitary Sherman goes up against 3 Tigers in the confined streets of a French village, employing its manoeuvrability and surprise.That last conflict is extremely well realised. A surprisingly generous level of base rewards the use of subwoofers, as these roaring dragon-like machines compete in the rural ideal. At the same time, as the ambush is prepared, a simple rhythmical riff gathers instrumental complexity, ratcheting-up the tension in a way that is both simple and effective. The riff doesn't get faster; more instruments are gradually included into the given tempo. A similar trick was employed in 'Henry V' of 1935 vintage. I'm surprised it isn't used more often.The action is realistic, the humour never jars with the tragedies that befall our heroes, locations are wonderfully evocative - I was convinced that this was shot in France, filming, editing and other technical issues all hit the spot. As a piece of action entertainment - wartime or otherwise - its hard to fault.You couldn't improve upon this movie even today. For one thing, the players simply don't exist who could fill these collective characters.

I used to hunt displaced spiritual energies with your uncle. -- Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard)I'm all for seasonal movie-watching, and Halloween just wouldn't be Halloween without something spooky to go watch. Unfortunately, new additions to the All Hallow's Eve staples (which, for me, include fare such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead and John Carpenter's Halloween) which bear up under repeated ritualistic viewing, are few and far between. This season, the most visible attempts are the remake of Thirteen Ghosts and Bones.Thirteen Ghosts was once a black and white grade C matinée of the early '60s made by low-budget schlockmeister William Castle; now it's an opulent and expensive-looking remake directed by special effects art director Steve Beck, responsible for some of the visual look of such films as The Hunt for Red October, The Abyss and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Considering his resume, Beck doesn't disappoint in the visuals of the film, in which widowed single dad Art Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub), avoiding creditors, is delighted to learn that he has inherited his late uncle Cyrus's mansion. When he and kids Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) and Alec Roberts (Traffic) arrive with smart aleck nanny Maggie (Rah Digga), they discover that Cyrus's house is a bizarre fusion of hi-tech and medieval influences featuring glass walls, ceilings and floors etched with phosphorescent Latin inscriptions. Before they can even get over how nifty-neato it all is, an ersatz Ghostbuster (Matthew Lillard) arrives to inform them that they have fallen into Cyrus's elaborate trap The house is a gigantic machine powered by the dead, one of those pesky interdimensional portals between Earth and Hell which, of course, requires a human sacrifice to finish its arcane spell. About the only aspect the remake shares with its progenitor is the gimmick of the characters wearing special goggles that enable them to see the wraiths, who are all, of course, bent on mortal misery.Visually, the film is stunning, featuring spectacular set design and horrific make-ups, some reminiscent of the Cenobites in Clive Barker's Hellraiser series. Plotwise, the picture meanders, confused, through a far worse maze than the house itself. After a somewhat involving credits sequence cleverly suggesting the events behind the loss of his wife, you settle into a familiar formula of waiting to see who gets killed and who doesn't, and not nearly enough people do, although the ghosts do in Uncle Cyrus's lawyer in a fairly novel way, prompting the best line in the picture Hey, where's the lawyer -- did he split? By the time Embeth Davidtz (Bridget Jones's Diary) shows up as another Ghostbuster, you just don't care anymore, which is a shame for Tony Shalhoub, who has long contributed memorable performances to such films as Big Night and The Siege, as well as funny turns in Men in Black and Galaxy Quest. It was a nice opportunity for him to carry a film, but by the third time everyone decides to split up and we'll meet back here in five minutes, you figure they all deserve to die.Less expensive-looking but just as visually atmospheric is Ernest Dickerson's Bones, which also takes place in a haunted house, except this one is downtown in a devastated 'hood. Once the home of gangster Jimmy Bones (Snoop Doggy Dogg), the house is now one of the creepiest places you've ever seen on film, augmented by computer-generated shadows that flow over the walls like sick black ichor right out of the pages of Lovecraft. Seems Jimmy Bones, a good gangster who vanished twenty years ago right as crack started hitting the neighborhood, has never been found, but you just know when a bunch of hip-hop bros decide to renovate the house into a nightclub that they're going to find out what happened, especially when Jimmy's old squeeze (Pam Grier, seen recently in Ghosts of Mars) keeps warning them to run while they can. But, hey, if the demoniac wolf-dog with the red glowing eyes who barfs up maggots all the time doesn't scare them away, you start to figure they deserve their fate just about as much as the homeys in the other movie.Yet, Bones still has more of a heart than Thirteen Ghosts, and builds excellently on the tradition of the blaxploitation films of the early '70s that proved black people go to movies too, and of which Grier was a seminal star in films like Foxy Brown (plus, she still looks pretty good for a gal in her mid-fifties). The breakdown occurs whenever The Dogg himself appears, but it's not necessarily his fault. He gave far better performances in Baby Boy and his cameo in Training Day. With his gaunt look and that '70s pimp suit, he has a striking appearance that makes for a great movie monster, visually, but he's just not given much to do. You want to see more of him and Grier, with the most involving sequence being a flashback that reveals the secret story of their tragedy, but the film concerns itself more with, as they say in endless Scooby Doo cartoons, those darn kids.Visually, Bones does a lot with a little, probably to be expected from director Dickerson, who was Spike Lee's cinematographer on films such as Do the Right Thing and Mo' Better Blues, and who directed a previous spirited supernatural romp, Demon Knight, which was a better film. But it falls down badly with its actors, particularly Michael Weiss (TV's The Pretender) as an aging cop-on-the-take, sporting some of the worst old-age make-up I've ever seen in a picture.Visually, both films deliver the creeps. Though Thirteen Ghost's budget is obviously more stratospheric, I prefer the sets in Bones as well as, ultimately, its more tragic characters.
