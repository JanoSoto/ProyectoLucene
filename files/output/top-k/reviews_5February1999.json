This film is one of the most original, profound films ever made, an experimental art house film on an epic canvas and it's a tragedy that people don't like it.   I think, however, that the strong opinions of some is a testament to the film's power.  I don't like to hear of dime store variety philosophy.  Terrence Malick was a Rhode scholar, Harvard-Oxford educated, MIT philosophy professor who at 21, went to Germany and actually helped Hiedegger (perhaps the most important philosopher since Kant) translate his works.   The people who say the symbolism (dying bird, et al.) is hackneyed and cheesy, but these are the same people who think that Scorsese's steaming manhole at the begging of Taxi Driver is a profound visual symbol.  Come on!   The Thin Red Line subverts our expectations and crosses the boundaries of genre and narrative. You really do get to know the characters, understand their feelings in the insantiy of war.  Thing is, war is a buddy, buddy situation.  When you're there, you don't get to know anyone very well because anyone can die at any given moment, and part of being a soldier is coming to an understanding of this.  Emotions are internalized, held back.  Not like Saving Private Ryan, where everyone has a story to tell, a memory to share. Of course Tom Hanks is a school teacher, of course the bible totting sharp-shooter is a southerner (think the University of Texas at Austin tower killings).  To make him from Chicago would have been original!!!  We know these characters as well as they know each other, and their love is unconditional, they are all in it together.   Malick creates a new cinematic vocabulary , and in the process attempts to do something that no filmmaker has ever done....that is change the world, change the way we think, the way we understand our place, being, and time.  Indeed, as Bell says of love, who lit this flame in us.  Taken superficially, as an action\/war film Malick displays rare talents.   We see bullets wizzing by for crying out loud.  The scene where every soldier is obscured by fog is genius. Spielburg turns war into Indiana Jones (Spielburg's gun on gun stand off between Nazi and GI Joe is insulting givin the seriousness of the situation and cliche when you think of the fact that Tarrentino and all his disciples have done it a thousand and one times).    There is none of that in Thin Red Line.   Look at the facial expressions in Thin Red Line, the memories, how these beautiful souls are trying to stay pure in Hell.  I'm thinking of John Cusak's face before the attack, of Witt's face, of Jared Leto's face as he realizes he has just sent two men to their deaths.   This is power.  The music, the cinematography, the writing are perfect.....and despite what they say, it is very, very close to the novel, right down to moments of dialgoue.....Worse thing you can do, worse than rape, is word for word James Jones.    It is also the first war film where the enemy is portrayed in a way as to suggest that in an alternate universe, there is a movie about the Japanese holding up in their bunker, watching thousands of Americans approach them - and the two films meet.      Note how there is not one flag in the film, and only cursory mention of japs. My thoughts race when I think of this film and I don't know where to begin.  I've seen it 3 times already since it came out and I want to see it again.    This film will not be forgotten.   Everyone should see it to realize there are no good wars, just wars.

This sort of thing is the stuff of male bonding, I guess, because they decide they like working together. A mysterious man shows up (Pete Postlethwaite, in a nice performance).

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"5 February 1999","score":"","review":"  Before i actually saw Gus Van Sandt's Psycho, I thought the concept behind the project sounded fascinating. Take the highly influential original, recast it with modern, well-known actors, keep the same screenplay with some minor updating and smoothing of the stilted 60s dialog, film the thing in color--but don't change anything else. In other words, treat the original the way we treat the oft-filmed plays of Shakespeare (you can never have too many film versions of hamlet, can you?). All I could think of after I'd seen the new Psycho however was, WHY? Why didn't this concept work? Why is this movie so boring? And ultimately Why was this done at all? Van Sandt's Psycho really, really, REALLY sucks. And it sucks for so many different reasons that they were difficult to sort out in my mind. Firstly, even though I love Vince Vaughn as an actor, he was wrong for Norman Bates. Vinny tries hard, but he is simply too big and scary for the part. Unlike Tony Perkins, who merely seemed nerdy and odd (up until the end), Vaughn seems insane and dangerous from the get-go. It's not his fault, though--all the actors are shown to a bad light. For one thing they are reciting a script that, while superficially revised, is actually very dated. The outrageously goofy dialog just doesn't fly in a modern setting. Cornball crap like this needs the Leave It To Beaver ambiance of the original to work-and that means, in part, black and white photography. Also, the more naturalistic acting styles of the new cast does not work to the film's advantage, either. It's distracting when paired up with the hitchcock's overly-familiar camera-work and Stephano's cornball 1950's TV style dialog. Suprisingly enough, I discovered that the original Psycho benefitted from the stock cardboard-y characters. Their one-dimensional qualities kept the movie focused entirely on the story; the inexorable movement forward to the suprise ending. The new Psycho has none of this momentum.

Firstly, even though I love Vince Vaughn as an actor, he was wrong for Norman Bates. Vinny tries hard, but he is simply too big and scary for the part. Unlike Tony Perkins, who merely seemed nerdy and odd (up until the end), Vaughn seems insane and dangerous from the get-go. It's not his fault, though--all the actors are shown to a bad light. For one thing they are reciting a script that, while superficially revised, is actually very dated. The outrageously goofy dialog just doesn't fly in a modern setting. Cornball crap like this needs the Leave It To Beaver ambiance of the original to work-and that means, in part, black and white photography. Also, the more naturalistic acting styles of the new cast does not work to the film's advantage, either. It's distracting when paired up with the hitchcock's overly-familiar camera-work and Stephano's cornball 1950's TV style dialog.

There should have been more attention paid to Kimberly Williams.

And in a lot of ways, it IS boring; not a lot happens during the course of the plot and as a horror film it utterly fails to provide a sense of urgency and fright in the conventional sense.It's also one of the most elaborate, mysterious and beautifully conceived big-budget fantasies committed to film.  The fact of its plodding storyline is, in a sense, besides the point of its true merit; that it is a dark, intensely brooding look at a woman's damaged sexuality and psyche and the oppressive times in which she existed.  The original Valerie Martin book ingeniously transmogrified the Robert Louis Stevenson story into an examination of a lost female soul who finds her redemption in a fog-shrouded hell.  Stephen Frear's film is in every respect a successful mood piece, a meditation on an individual's dark journey into not just a world of physical violence but her own crippled sense of selfhood and history of abuse.  More than most other contemporary films about the Victorian era, this film captures in meticulous and visceral detail the horrors of the Industrial Age---the poverty, the pollution-ridden streets filled with animal gore and filth, and the era's preoccupation\/repulsion of the human body and the ominous glare of scientific knowledge gone awry in a society ill-prepared to meet the consequences. The cinematography and production design  (by the great Stuart Craig) are breathtaking.   A swinging door, partially obscuring the surgically opened corpse  on a table...Mary making her way through the streets of the market, surrounded by animal viscera...the shock of a roomful of a prostitute's remains, savagely gutted by a demonic hand...rats in the sewer, swarming into the crevices of Mary's mind...the Doctor's operating theater, like a coliseum of depravity...Mary, lost in the fog.These images were indelible to me and entertained my consciousness far more than any typical horror film could hope to.  Julia Roberts, for all her trouble with the Irish accent and going against her image as America's sweetheart, is the very picture of a haunted and ravaged soul, nearly destroyed by the abuse and poverty of her childhood and bewildered by the mysterious machinations of her homicidal employer.  She lends a great deal of vulnerability and conviction to her role and carries the film in ways beyond dialogue and posturing.  Not once does she flash her trademark million-dollar smile but what she gives to the film is far more valuable than glitz and in her looks and inflections reveals more on-screen than most of her other films combined.This film won't appeal to most people.  And admittedly, it does fail in so many ways that a lot of audiences will be turned off. A lot of people will definitely be bored to tears by the slow pace and what the H*ll is happening?!?!? quality of the narrative. But for viewers who liked Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, Neil Jordan's Comany of Wolves Caleb Carr's book The Alienist or perhaps Ken Russell's Gothic, this is worth a try.  It should not be written off as just another big-budget Hollywood failure, because its aims, whether conscious or not, are quite different from your average thriller or period film.

It's too long, and the love story between Redford and Scott Thomas(which, admittedly, was the part of the book which most made me want to gag), was cut down, which was nice, but the result was there weren't many sparks between them, except perhaps when they dance together.Still, it's a good film.  The rest of the cast is very good, particularly Chris Cooper and Dianne Wiest as Redford's brother and sister-in-law, respectively, and especially Scarlet Johanson as Scott Thomas' daughter. She took her character through the whole journey being convincing every step of the way.  Three of Redford's previous movies as director(ORDINARY PEOPLE, A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, QUIZ SHOW) dealt with father\/son relationships. This is his first mother\/daughter one, and I found it better handled than the love story.  Redford and writers Richard LaGravanese(who rescued BRIDGES) and Eric Roth were smart enough to infer, rather than state, that Johanson's getting better was tied in with the horse getting better.The other thing I liked is, like in A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, Redford evokes the West and at the same time demystifies it.
