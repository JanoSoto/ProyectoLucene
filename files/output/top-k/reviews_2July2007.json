I saw it again several years later, and don't recall thinking much of it during that viewing, either. However, after watching the highly acclaimed Robert Zemeckis movie again recently (this time a good few years after my last viewing, I believe), although I still can't exactly call it one of my favourite features, I now understand why it has such wide appeal! In 1985, Marty McFly is a teenager who is not exactly popular with his peers, but does have a girlfriend named Jennifer Parker. His best friend is Dr. Emmett Doc Brown, an oddball local scientist. One night, Marty meets Doc out in a parking lot, where he is to assist the scientist with his new invention, a time machine made by a car! To make the machine powerful enough, Doc has used plutonium, which he got from a terrorist group who were expecting him to make a bomb with it! Unfortunately, just as Doc is about to travel through time, the terrorists track him down and shoot him! They then go after Marty, who manages get away in Doc's machine, but ends up being transported to the year 1955, back when his parents were around his age! Eventually, he meets the Doc of that time and manages to figure out a way to get back to 1985 with his assistance. However, Marty also learns that he has altered history, and must somehow get his parents together in order to save his very existence! This movie may start out a tad sluggish, but for the vast majority of the approximate two hours that it runs for, it is consistently entertaining! Most of Back to the Future is very exciting, with a lot of action, and it also works reasonably well as a comedy, with quite a few laughs here and there. Basically, the main cast members all nothing less than reasonable in their performances (I haven't noticed any really bad ones during any of my several viewings). The most notable performance (one that's definitely MORE than reasonable) is that of Christopher Lloyd, who fits the role of Doc Brown very well. The movie wouldn't quite be the same without this character and his antics! For all those reasons, this first installment in the Back to the Future trilogy is one fine accomplishment! Over two decades after the release of this sci-fi comedy, it remains extremely popular. It's current position in the IMDb Top 250 is obviously proof of that. No movie can please 100% of its viewers, but clearly, the majority of people who have seen Back to the Future at any point in the past 22 years have enjoyed it, and that's a lot of people, so the film deserves a lot of credit! If you usually like to see the sci-fi and comedy genres combined, and you haven't seen this particular combination of the two for any reason, I strongly suggest you watch it as soon as possible!

Beatty plays George Roundy, a not entirely bright but nimble hairdresser on a motorcycle who is much beloved and desired by woman. The women doing most of the desiring are Lee Grant (Felicia), Julie Christie (Jackie), and Goldie Hawn (Jill). Jack Warden plays Lester a successful investor who, to his chagrin and ultimate amusement, learns that his wife, his mistress, and his daughter Lorna (Carrie Fisher) are being bedded by the guy he thinks is gay. (Shades of the sham eunuch in the harem!) This is a premise that many in the Hollywood Hills could not resist, the irony cutting so beautifully through the canyons and swimming pools and the lavish parties. Most of the action takes place on that November day in 1968 when Nixon and Agnew were swept into the White House by the silent majority. Lester and his friends are quite pleased and are celebrating as the election returns come in. Meanwhile George is trying to raise money so he can open his own shop since he's got the heads. Keeping the heads though turns out to be more than he can handle--and to be honest jumping from bed to bed several times a day with several different women might be too much for any man.Will Georgie-Porgie, puddin' pie (who kissed the girls and made them cry) get the money for his shop and the girl he loves--and which girl is it, that he loves? Goldie Hawn wears a micro-mini (but there's no peeking!) and Julie Christie sports a short pony skirt with boots while Lee Grant has to play the eldest woman. Now, who gets George and would she really want him? Some nice sixties\/seventies Hollywood decadence graces the screen along with free love and don't bogart that number. In the background there are a lot of mug shots of Nixon and Agnew in juxtaposition as a kind of joke since the movie was made in 1975 not long after Watergate.Beatty, playing a role said to be patterned after makeup artist Jay Sebring, is competent and wins our sympathy, maybe because we know he's never going to amount to much.

Cimino did not create one movie but a series of movies roughly revolving around a centrepiece. He was not making a war movie; rather, he was creating a pastiche of little movies with the same characters, much as he did in his hugely misunderstood Heaven's Gate.For many reasons Heaven's Gate misfired and today we must sit through movies that begin and end virtually in the same time-frame and with a vertically constructed story line. We do not have the great directors of the 70s and 80s to stretch the composition of film as Cimino and some of his compatriots did.Deer Hunter was Cimino's exploration of many of those themes that he was to develop in Heaven's Gate the use of eastern Europeans as the matrix for the film, long scenes that many viewers saw as unnecessary, scenes crowded with people, long or medium shots rather than the current mania for massive closeups and movies within movies to mention only a few.People have commentated here that the Russian Roulett scene was a metaphor for America's catastrophe in Vietnam; however, I see it as a metaphor for growing up. The potential for disaster growing up in a little steel town is manifest; the only thing that saves your mind is being too young to recognise the dangers confronting you.

The story is long and drawn out, but doesn't have enough depth to earn that length. The protagonists have a long road to demonstrate depth. It never really happens. One is loyal to both his family and his prejudices. The other is a simple minded but good hearted kid, on his way to being that very same thing as an adult. They remain who they were, with the expected friction along the way.It's got the classic fingerprints of old time movies The acting is more like stage than film. Not a lot of vocal range in the delivery of lines, focusing instead on volume for the benefit of the audience hearing the lines. Unfortunately, the script isn't sophisticated enough for the wooden delivery to carry it through.Many scenes are corny and over the top. Supporting characters are predictable and fit neatly into clichés established over the previous decades of film-making.

John Wayne playing a character with a first-hinted-at-and-then-plainly-naked dark side is not enough to garner my praise. In most of his westerns, he is morally neutral to slightly good, so it's not a big shift.

The sequel to the first movie was often criticised for being too complicated to understand- and yet it is due to the various sub-plots taking place within the movie, which makes this instalment the most interesting and eventful in the series. As others have rightly pointed out on here, Back To The Future Part 2, will probably make no sense to you unless you have seen and understood the first film. The plot, is in itself, complicated Marty McFly with Doc Brown travel forward in time to 2015 and to prevent further crises taking place with the future McFly family. As they do so, Biff, Marty's arch- enemy has got hold of a book that contains a list of sports statistics and results. With this, he uses it to make a fortune for himself, and hence he becomes a very rich man. Marty and the Doc have to retrieve the book, as well as to make sure they do not come into contact with alternate versions of themselves.

Marty and Doc Brown then travel back in time to 1955- where most of the first movie was based- to set the record straight.The film has so many great twists and in contrast to the first film, the narrative doesn't follow in the same way as your typical time-travelling flick.

The main leads in Fox, Lloyd, as well as the supporting cast in Thompson, Shue and Wilson all held the film in place really well and delivered their lines and performances with such style and professionalism.

Even though the story was complicated to get to grips with, BTTF 2 was unique and original in its own way, particularly as it had more to offer in terms of twists and turns. The first film was good, whilst with the third, I thought that the Wild West setting was somewhat of a mistake as it just didn't work as well as it should.

I have only ever seen the Richard Lester version of the film and I will admit there are some things wrong with it, but it is an all around good film. I just wonder how better this movie would have been with Richard Donner's version.Superman 2, along with the original Superman, has a superb line of actors who play in the film. Christopher Reeves is a very good Clark Kent and Superman. He portrays the character beautifully. Margot Kidder still amazes me with how well she handles Lois Lane. She plays the stubborn and devoted journalist perfectly. Gene Hackman is a terrific Lex Luthor. He brings almost a comedic approach to the character while also keeping him a dangerous threat. He sticks true to his villainous and stylish character while adding his own personal traits to the character. Terrence Stamp, in my opinion, steals the show as the villainous General Zod! He is one of three alien life-forms who come to earth to defeat Superman and claim the planet for themselves. Stamp is an extremely serious and evil villain who captivates. He plays the character with an absolute seriousness that seems unrivaled by any other Super-villain portrayed in a film!The story is good! The three villains are wonderful! I absolutely love them! I think the entire love sequences with Lois Lane and Clark Kent are pushed along to fast! Although the story does a good job of introducing the concept of testing Supermans moral beliefs. A story focusing on the decisions of Superman and his responsibilities as a hero! Moments where Clark and Lois are talking seem just stupid though! Like when they are in the hotel, I feel almost sick to my stomach! I do not feel a good connection between them happening in this film. It happens just to fast. The action sequences are great! I absolutely love watching the three alien villains attacking the small town and the fight scenes in Metropolis! Superman 2 is a very good movie!

However, in January 1964, it was the exact opposite that was said about Dr. Strangelove.Today, the Cold War issues remain present, but they're far less important than the scenario that was being drawn at the end of the year 1963, that is the moment where this classic Stanley Kubrick comedy was shot. It was the time of the Freezing War, the scary Cuban Missile Crisis was still fresh in the collective mind and the young President Kennedy was just being assassinated.That's when arrived this movie, which dared to show a nuclear apocalypse with a comic eye. But what could have been funny in there? It's possible to laugh of the mishaps of somebody other than ourselves, but when everybody is concerned, it's far less funny. Just remember the 9\/11 aftermath, when rumors of WWIII surfaced...But Stanley Kubrick, being a master of virtually every genre, conceived an astoundingly funny comedy, skilfully mixing the suspense from a man-made end-of-the-world with the absurdity of the characters who act in, sometimes without knowing it.Kubrick worked with a talented screenwriter in the person of Terry Southern, but especially with prodigious actors. I'm evidently referring to Peter Sellers, whose three roles entered into the legend, and George C. Scott, whose role quality rivals with his Oscar-winning performance of General Patton in the movie Patton, released six years later.Based on the theme of the failure to communicate, the movie is set in three different places. Primo the Burpleson Air Force Base, headed by General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), a psychotic obsessed by fluoridation which saps and impurifies all of our precious bodily fluids. His aide de camp is Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake (Sellers), a timid but highly competent English officer who doesn't buy Ripper's theories.Secundo a B-52 piloted by Major King Kong (western star Slim Pickens). We see Kong and his crew (which includes young James Earl Jones) preparing themselves to the nuclear strike and composing with unexpected difficulties which will provide even more thrills.Tertio the Pentagon or more precisely, the War Room. It's there that the three most interesting characters of the story are located President Merkin Muffley (Sellers), General Buck Turgidson (Scott) and hilarious mad scientist Dr. Strangelove (Sellers). They try to communicate with drunken Soviet president Kissoff, but in vain.Dr. Strangelove is among the greatest comedies ever made, but this statement isn't based upon the quantity of laughs that the movie unfolds. In fact, the first time I watched it, I only laugh wildly twice when Turgidson stumbles in the War Room and when Dr. Strangelove is struggling with his uncontrollable alien right hand.Instead, Dr. Strangelove plays on tongue-in-cheek humor and the absurdity of the characters, as well as some subtleties. The best example is the impossible names of the characters, which have almost all a sexual connotation. There's a list Merkin Muffley, Turgidson, Kissoff, de Sadesky, Bat Guano and Jack D. Ripper. We also laugh of improbable messages or writings, like the post in the base on which it is written Peace is our profession, at the moment where soldiers are fighting each other. There's also the useless  NUCLEAR WARHEAD \u2013 HANDLE WITH CARE.It is obvious that the movie wouldn't have been so successful without the exceptional performance of its three main actors. Peter Sellers is remarkably all-round and he's an unequaled master with different accents. His Dr. Strangelove role is probably the greatest of his career, even if the character himself appears on-screen for about ten minutes only.George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden and Slim Pickens are the other mentionable actors. Scott is very funny with his character who spends most of his time at chewing gum, making ridiculous facial expressions and insulting the Russkies. Hayden is disturbing with his perpetual cigar and his monologues about fluoridation and Commies. The orders he gives to his troops before the base attack are particularly absurd, especially when he says Don't trust any man, except if you know him personally. As for Pickens, he will always be remembered for his idiot but enjoyable-to-hear speeches and for his cowboy hat which he wears until the end, during the most memorable scene, where he rides the bomb like a matador riding a bull in a rodeo.Not only is this movie very funny, it's also very pessimistic. How many times do we speak of prejudices and no-confidence between people? Even at the end, when doomsday is unavoidable...And I've almost forgotten to mention the precious aid from production designer Ken Adam. Without him, there wouldn't be no War Room, this fictitious but pop culture-iconic room. The interior of the B-52 is also well-made.However, the plane exterior is the main problem of the film. To suspend a plane model in front of the camera with a Russian land background is a big disappointment, especially when we know how fussy director Kubrick is.But from the opening title sequence, where a plane refueling looks like a jumbo-size sexual act, to the final scene, where a sequence of nuclear explosions is accompanied by the famous Vera Lynn song We'll Meet Again, it's guaranteed that Dr. Strangelove never bores. Even if universal peace happens someday, we'll watch this movie with a large smile and a satisfied mood. That's what we call a timeless classic...

We see Kong and his crew (which includes young James Earl Jones) preparing themselves to the nuclear strike and composing with unexpected difficulties which will provide even more thrills.Tertio the Pentagon or more precisely, the War Room. It's there that the three most interesting characters of the story are located President Merkin Muffley (Sellers), General Buck Turgidson (Scott) and hilarious mad scientist Dr. Strangelove (Sellers). They try to communicate with drunken Soviet president Kissoff, but in vain.Dr. Strangelove is among the greatest comedies ever made, but this statement isn't based upon the quantity of laughs that the movie unfolds. In fact, the first time I watched it, I only laugh wildly twice when Turgidson stumbles in the War Room and when Dr. Strangelove is struggling with his uncontrollable alien right hand.Instead, Dr. Strangelove plays on tongue-in-cheek humor and the absurdity of the characters, as well as some subtleties. The best example is the impossible names of the characters, which have almost all a sexual connotation. There's a list Merkin Muffley, Turgidson, Kissoff, de Sadesky, Bat Guano and Jack D. Ripper. We also laugh of improbable messages or writings, like the post in the base on which it is written Peace is our profession, at the moment where soldiers are fighting each other. There's also the useless  NUCLEAR WARHEAD \u2013 HANDLE WITH CARE.It is obvious that the movie wouldn't have been so successful without the exceptional performance of its three main actors. Peter Sellers is remarkably all-round and he's an unequaled master with different accents. His Dr. Strangelove role is probably the greatest of his career, even if the character himself appears on-screen for about ten minutes only.George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden and Slim Pickens are the other mentionable actors. Scott is very funny with his character who spends most of his time at chewing gum, making ridiculous facial expressions and insulting the Russkies. Hayden is disturbing with his perpetual cigar and his monologues about fluoridation and Commies. The orders he gives to his troops before the base attack are particularly absurd, especially when he says Don't trust any man, except if you know him personally. As for Pickens, he will always be remembered for his idiot but enjoyable-to-hear speeches and for his cowboy hat which he wears until the end, during the most memorable scene, where he rides the bomb like a matador riding a bull in a rodeo.Not only is this movie very funny, it's also very pessimistic. How many times do we speak of prejudices and no-confidence between people? Even at the end, when doomsday is unavoidable...And I've almost forgotten to mention the precious aid from production designer Ken Adam. Without him, there wouldn't be no War Room, this fictitious but pop culture-iconic room. The interior of the B-52 is also well-made.However, the plane exterior is the main problem of the film. To suspend a plane model in front of the camera with a Russian land background is a big disappointment, especially when we know how fussy director Kubrick is.But from the opening title sequence, where a plane refueling looks like a jumbo-size sexual act, to the final scene, where a sequence of nuclear explosions is accompanied by the famous Vera Lynn song We'll Meet Again, it's guaranteed that Dr. Strangelove never bores. Even if universal peace happens someday, we'll watch this movie with a large smile and a satisfied mood. That's what we call a timeless classic...

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is born in Salzburg. He has an incredible talent for writing music, and he uses that talent to become of of the most popular composers in Wien. Even though the movie is called Amadeus i feel the main character is Mozart's rival and antagonizer Salieri, played by F. Murray Abraham to perfection. It starts out as simple jealousy from Salieri's side, but i quickly becomes personal when Salieri finds out that Mozart have slept with the woman he coveted. He begins to plot the murder of Mozart.Milos Forman, who have made One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest before, flawlessly brings the story forward in a calm, but never boring pace, despite the long running time of 180 minutes.

Was she as good as she seemed, or was she just playing the corporate field to better her advantage? The other question that came to mind was her coincidental neurosis dealing with the sporadic meeting with her boss. There was nothing, outside of moving the plot forward, which would have indicated these sudden laps of shame in her profession. The drop-in of Julia Styles suddenly meeting in the same business setting (having never met before), missing a plane together, and coincidentally ending up at the same bar sharing drinks and eventually inner secrets, just flabbergasted me. Why would these two ever meet up in a typical setting? While I don't want to think that this was just a film about the imagination of Channing, it did make you question and use the word why. Typically I like this mind-boggling element in films, but in Business of Strangers, it just didn't work. There was no tell in this film, and that tugged at me the wrong way in this film. The eerie patience that was demanded of the viewer left us with no moment of satisfaction. There was quite a bit of wait, but no payoff at the end. On one hand we have a very self-centered woman, career bent, but possibly not happy with her choices, and yet on the other we have a care-free young lady, experimental in nature, ready to change the world one person at a time. It seemed too forced, too stereotypical &#150; too manipulative. I needed more similarities; I needed more shock to really bring these two strangers together. This tried to be a darker rendition of The Odd Couple with drinking, rape, and random revenge. Force enough onto a character (or characters), the audience begins to believe that it is a Hollywood feature, and you meaning imperatively finds itself lost in the trenches.Acting. In Business of Strangers it wasn't bad, but it wasn't the greatest that I have seen of Stiles or Channing. Their chemistry was decent, but it didn't compare to that of those characters in Tape or Company of Men. This was obviously a stage film, meaning that it was a small play that had the unique opportunity to see the other side of a film camera. It was a boring premise, which is one reason I feel so fooled by this film, which was followed up by my second pet peeve of this film, it never tackled any real issues. Who were these two characters that we so dutifully were thrust into their lives? What makes them tick? What is their past? What is their future? Most importantly, at least with this film, what makes them connect? Unlike other films brought from the stage, Business of Strangers answers none of the above. Perhaps it is my male view on a very personal female film, but this was released to general audiences, so the appeal had to be broad. It was not emotional, it was not sad, nor was it victorious at the end. While I do not think rape is a minute problem in America, I do feel that I needed more with Channing and Stiles. Was she lying about the incident? Was she just trying to get Channing to release something from within? I wanted answers, I was pining inside for them, but the never arrived. Unlike Shape of Things, there was just something missing. It was as if a big chunk of the film was misplaced. Fred Weller did a decent job, but his motive was missing.Director Stettner did his job by bringing the characters together in, albeit, random events. He set the stage with surprisingly the darkest of corners and hidden hotel rooms. There was even a moment of unneeded tension in a scene (while I felt it wasn't needed) that was done with some bit of grace, but he continued to forget the element mentioned above &#133; motive. There was no reason to answer the question why, when our characters were taking unmotivated photographs, when they were about to commit murder, or when they were talking to each other like they had known each other for years. There was no reason for director Stettner to get us from point A to point B, so in my opinion, he moved the action along through a series for unconnected points. Sure, the acting was meaty, but the words that they spoke merely were attached to a script which eventually had to have and ending. For a little over and hour, I watched good actors read through a bad script. Again, if there was more creativity in the motion of Stettner's work, then maybe I would have felt better by the ending, but I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat, the characters didn't have me questioning the validity of my own life, nor was I ready to gush Niagara Falls over the body of work. By the end, I felt bland, as if I just watched a feminist remake of In the Company of Men or Tape.Overall, I wish I could say that I can suggest this film, but I cannot. The acting, with enough said above, you should realize that these are two great actors working through an abominable script. The story was pieced together probably overnight without much thought going into the entire process. It was dark, but the tones were miscommunicated as we tried to grapple with the idea that these two people had never met before but spoke as if they were best friends. Coupled with dialog that would make kindergarteners chuckle, Business of Strangers was a film packed with missed possibilities. If you are looking for either a redemption film or a film about coping with your tough job, may I suggest anything outside of this film.

It is under these circumstances that Lester meets and becomes infatuated with Jane's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), further propelling what's left of the father-daughter relationship into oblivion.Things take a turn following these events (for the good or for the worse is for the viewer to decide), and there is a drastic change in Lester's attitude towards life in general. He is suddenly transformed into a couldn't-care-less-about-you individual, and takes to working out and even smoking pot, in order to impress the ever-turned-on Angela. The movie carries on from here and climaxes with a bang (the last 20 minutes are a roller-coaster ride of emotions and unexpected events), and each character has a logical end to his\/her story.The movie is worth multiple viewings for Kevin Spacey's performance in itself, and then a few more for the dark-humoured well-written script. Annette Benning, Wes Bentley and Chris Cooper have also delivered very convincing performances, but Spacey overshadows everything and everyone in this movie, and rightfully deserves his Oscar. I am grateful to my friend, without whose insistence, I may not have watched this and missed a milestone in Hollywood cinema.My rating  8\/10 ","genre":"Drama"}]
