I don't care if the movie was shot over 18 days for barely $1 million, watching this movie is about as pleasant as licking scrotum sweat off a cadaver. This script should never have been greenlit in the first place, writer James Gunn should have approached Dark Horse or some other indie comic publisher and done a black-and-white graphic novel. It could have been halfway decent in that format and it is a lot easier to sell the superhero stuff in comics than it is in a film without money for special effects.My feeling is you can't make a superhero movie for a mil, I don't care how you're doing it. Never for an instant does anybody believe any of the guys in this movie have any powers. I think it would've made a huge difference if they had shown one or two shots of members of the Specials using their powers early on to establish their cred as heroes, but they don't and it's impossible for the cast to simulate superpowers, no matter how good they are as actors.The annoying thing about this is that you give $1 million bucks and 18 days to a number of directors, they could turn out something pretty special. Kevin Smith made Clerks for $20K for crissakes, and even considering inflation that would've been maybe $60K in 2000, when this was made.Instead, director Craig Mazin and writer Gunn have given us another bottom-of-the-barrel superhero movie, as if we needed another one of those.It just goes to show how bass ackwards Hollywood can be--if these guys worked in any other business and this was the work they produced, they would be abruptly fired and unable to ever work again in that industry. But the movie business doesn't seem to care whether their products are any good, hence Mazin is directing the upcoming Superhero! and Gunn is writing other gems like Scooby Doo 2. And there are still people out there that wonder why movies suck.

John pursues the thieves but is badly hurt in a car crash, Brenda Bradford (Joely Fisher) the daughter of Artemus reconstructs John as a new high tech police officer cyborg with dozens of inbuilt attachments & gadgets. After being placed on the local police force & nicknamed Inspector Gadget John sets out to catch those responsible for his own & Dr. Artemus' death, the rich businessman Sanford Scolex (Rupert Everett) also know as Claw due to the fact he has a claw rather than a hand...Directed by David Kellogg one has to say that while it's not a complete disaster I feel a lot more could have been done with this live-action film of the popular Inspector Gadget (1983 - 1986) TV cartoon series that ran for two seasons & eighty-six half an hour episodes. I don't want to get all nostalgic here but I remember seeing this on British children's TV over here during the mid-eighties & was one of my favourite show's (along with The Trap Door, He-Man, The Mysterious Cities of Gold, Thundercats & the like, those were the days...) although I can't really recall any of it. Anyway, the script here was by Kerry Ehrin & Zak Penn & the main thing that stands out is that this Inspector Gadget live-action film is extremely silly & aimed squarely at younger children & I mean young because anyone with half a brain really isn't going to find any of this particularly funny. There are many, many scenes which are played purely for laughs which is fine because that what it evidently set out to do but for fans of the cartoon show this film has really, really dumbed it down to silly slapstick comedy with lots of CGI computer effects that kids will look at & say 'wow, that's cool' while anyone over the age of five will look at it & say something more along the lines of 'wow, that's silly & not very funny'. The plot is also lacking, again I know it's for young kids but I'm not a young kid so I'll call it as I see it & say the plot is poor, Claw poses no threat or menace whatsoever & barely even has a plan other than to build some robots to sell to armies worldwide. OK great, but since that motive is money driven & he's already a billionaire businessman I found myself asking the question why? The character's are slim as well, they are strictly one dimensional which again is alright for young kids but for anyone older than five it's not so good. At a mere 78 minutes (including opening & closing credits) at least it's short, it moves along like a rocket & it isn't boring.Director Kellogg does OK, the action set-pieces although silly & impossible to take seriously do have a certain energy & imagination about them. The CGI computer effects vary, some are very good like when Gadget uses his helicopter gadget to fly through the city but other's are terrible. It generally stays quite faithful to the cartoon with all the major character's included although they are presented in a different light here, Penny Inspector Gadget's niece for instance is no longer the brains who solves every case for her bumbling uncle, Chief Quimby is different & Claw is very different as well with no deep voice or metal hand & in the cartoon series his face was never shown. One thing I must mention though is that there is a lot of product placement & that Gadgetmobile is extremely irritating. The best jokes in the entire film come during the closing credits, the single funniest moment comes when Claw's henchman Sikes attends a meeting of the Minion's Support Group including Richard Kiel who played Jaws in the James Bond films & lookalikes of Oddjob & Nik-Nak as well as a cameo from Mr. T! With a supposed budget of about $75,000,000 this had a much bigger budget than I thought although I'd have said most of that went on the extensive CGI computer effects. The acting is as one dimensional as the character's the actor's are given, basically no-one is going to win any Oscars for this.Inspector Gadget is a Disney film aimed squarely at the younger audience which is fine I suppose but I would imagine a lot of teens & adults who grew up with the cartoon will be very disappointed with it, not unlike myself as it goes. It's strange because Disney usually make films that can be enjoyed by both the young & old but that's not really the case with Inspector Gadget. Followed by the straight-to-video\/DVD Inspector Gadget 2 (2003) which is meant to be even worse than this, I shudder at the mere thought...
