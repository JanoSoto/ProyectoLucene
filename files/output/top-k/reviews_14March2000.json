While I am more enamored of his less artistic works to begin with, such as Dr. Strangelove or A Clockwork Orange, this movie didn't even meet the levels of 2001.One of the best parts of most of Kubrick's work is that he keeps you enraptured throughout his films, never taking your eyes off the screen. Not so here. The first 45 minutes seem to stretch on endlessly. Nicole Kidman, especially, is simply playing a bad character. She isn't so much the wife on the protagonist, Tom Cruise's Dr. Bill Hartford, as much as she's another aspect of the libido we explore throughout the film. This is symbolized ad nauseam, mainly in the fact that Kidman takes about 30 seconds between every word she speaks, so as to give the impression of a far off angel, I suppose.There are some good spots, when Cruise's character hits the street. Vinessa Shaw, a lady of the street, and Todd Field, an old friend who shows him another world of sorts, are very good. There are some moments that make you sit up and say Wow, the kind of thing only Stanley Kubrick can do. The problem here is that Kubrick tries to inject too many of those moments into his film, instead of letting them come naturally, and it doesn't have the same effect. All in all, this isn't a bad movie, but not as good as you might expect given some of the names working on out. There is layer upon layer of symbolism and insight, and sometimes it crashes upon itself, and you're left wondering what exactly Kubrick was aiming for with certain scenes. The movie is worth seeing, but don't go in with your expectations too high, especially if you're familiar with some of Kubrick's earlier works.

I met Supernova with some low expectations, but at least I wanted some reasonable special effects. Actually, they are utterly dull and lifeless. Am I supposed to believe that nothing really happens to Robin Tunney when she gets thrown in space? Her lungs would have exploded because of the difference of pressure. But no, it seems that she is just going to suffocate. The performers are delivering the lines of a dumb screenplay. James Spader is mediocre, to say the least, in an absolutely thankless role. Angela Bassett, who experienced her ups and downs (worst performance in Critters 4, astounding performances in What's Love Got To Do With It and Strange Days), is also experiencing her last (hopefully) dumb movie role. She has some lines that are completely useless to the development of the plot. Robin Tunney is very unlucky lately. In 1999, she appeared in two movies this one and End of Days. As usual, she is terrible. Someone has to tell her good looks (that includes breasts) do not usually mix with talent.The plot is less than dumb. It starts quietly, 10 minutes pass nothing interesting happens, 20 minutes pass, ooh, we got a distress signal, let's do a jump (which looks incredibly like Star Trek warp travel). Finally something mildly entertaining happens the captain is fused in plastic, let's kill him. Then for 10 more minutes, I yawn. A sexy villain appears, let's see some gratuitous nudity.

This film is a visual masterpiece; a movie that deserves to be a holiday favorite for some time to come.\tThe atmosphere director Henry Celiac captures in The Nightmare Before Christmas is truly breathtaking. The cities and setting in which these characters live are visually perplexing, yet descriptive and develop the production's mood perfectly. We, as audiences starving for originality and imagination, are able to enter a scope so believable and unrelentingly convincing we lust for every last minute of it.The movie's protagonist is Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of the holiday town of Halloween. Jack is the role model for much of the cities population. The only problem is that Jack has been around for ages, parked in a town where every single year builds up for a conventional holiday, Halloween.

We learn of his passion for new events and a and new life through a musical number that is both effective and engaging.Later on that vary night, Jack wonders off into a nearby woods and stumbles upon an area surrounded with magical doors leading to specific holiday worlds. Jack, blooming with curiosity, enters Christmas town a joyful, happy place with snow, glitter, children singing, and colorful lights decorating the village in its entirety.

It is certainly a musical production, and at times, I felt that the songs replaced essential development. However, the musical numbers are challenging and memorable, containing passion and emotion. The picture is a walk into the mind of some of the most wildly imaginative filmmakers of our time.

Tea With Mussolini is one such effort.Set in Florence during the second world war, the story revolves around an Italian orphan named Luca who is taken in by a a group of elderly British ladies.  Complete with their homespun customs which includes high tea and staunch manners, these ladies set about instilling in Luca the passion that they have for his art-filled city.  They remain oblivious to the war that is brewing around them, and in fact the ring leader of the group, Lady Chester (played wonderfully by Maggie Smith) has tea with the dictator, getting his assurances that these British nobles will remain safe. Cher plays the much despised American, Elsa, who spends her rich husband's money on art and other lavish objects.  Her personal connection to Luca, (his mother made clothes for her) creates a connection to her and the others.  The women are eventually interned and this becomes a coming of age story for Luca as well as for the women.  Ignore the fact that the story tends to drag just a tad.  Tea With Mussolini is a period piece, complete with gorgeous settings and great costumes.  Furthermore, it is an opportunity to see several actresses strut their stuff with a script filled with some brilliant lines.  Maggie Smith stands out, flaunting her British airs at every opportunity.  All the great people have empires these days.  Her visit with Mussolini is a classic scene and she milks it for all its worth.  In fact this is Smith's best work in several years.  Cher over does her part as the flamboyant rich girl.  She sports some great outfits but its sometimes hard to believe that she  is the spoiled American princess with a heart of gold that Elsa is supposed to be.  Cher does sing at one point (and what a campy moment that was) and of course she does look the part.Judi Dench was a bit of a let down playing the sentimental artist.  She wasn't bad in the role, but after seeing her play some tough queens in her recent past, seeing her here playing a wimp is a bit of a challenge.  Joan Plowright and Lily Tomlin are both passable in their roles, but again, I felt their talents a little wasted here.  Tea With Mussolini is worth at least one viewing.  Fans of Cher and Maggie Smith will not be disappointed. The city of Florence is certainly showcased well, as are the actresses.  Perhaps the thin plot line was a result of someone trying to find something for all of these women to do.

The film has not been released yet here in Argentina but I had read about the new Bruce Willis' hit after the blockbuster The sixth sense. That made me go for it. I must say that the movie did not disappoint me. I laugh a lot although English is not my mother language. Here, we see the movies subtitled. The comedy is a black comedy as we use to say. Although murdering and killing is the key to take the whole nine yards, the plot is funny and the story is entertaining. Let's talk about the stars. Bruce Willis is perfect for his role and his character. Matthew Perry does the same as in the TV series Friends but is a little more naive. Michael Clarke Duncan shows why he is an Oscar nominee for The green mile.
