[{"date":"21 May 2006","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Religion is a dangerous thing. It has started many major wars and is the cause of millions of deaths throughout human history. But whether or not you're Christian, Muslim or Hindu, you know that one religion is more dangerous than any other Scientology. Because no other religion in the history of mankind has spawned a movie as abysmally awful as the majestic super-turkey Battlefield Earth.The plot, if there was one, concerns a group of very ugly and expendable people locked up somewhere 1000 years after an alien race called 'Psychlos' (which is a combination of 'psychos' and the 'L' in L. Ron Hubbard) has destroyed civilization as we know it (kind of like Janet Jackson at the Superbowl). Also, the aliens are people with contact lenses, big heads and dreadlocks. Um... Yeah. That about sums it up. There's also a hero, played (?) by Barry Pepper, an ugly old priest-something to whom the sixties weren't too good, and a dumb-as-a-brick girlfriend who has nothing to do but mope.John Travolta camps around with awful lines, laughing like an idiot, possibly in a state of suppressed panic as he slowly starts to realize that he's possibly not doing his pal L. Ron Hubbard a favor by starring in this film. The technical and factual flaws are too many to list and so obvious it's like the makers were joking. If that is the case, hardy f-ing har, big laughs! The goofs range from minor nuisances like the fact that Travolta's character speaks English when he's supposedly speaking Psychlon, to miles-wide plot holes like how the Harriers can still run after 1000 years, or how unprotected books are still intact.So, the cringe-worthy performances and holes you could put Peter Harryson's butt through aside, can Battlefield Earth at least count as silly fun? Why, of course not! Every skewed shot, every mindless scene of this movie seems intent on making the viewing experience as unpleasant for the viewer as possible. If they're not out of focus, the shots are likely to be ruined by one-colour filters, but what can you really expect when the director is doped up all throughout shooting? Barry Pepper is so bad as the supposed hero the makers could just as well have slapped a Cheney mask on a traffic light and called it acting. The only reason I even remember the name of his non-character is because it is so offensively stupid (how lame is 'Johnny Goodboy', seriously?!) I recommend the PC game of the similar name. The movie, on the other hand, you should avoid like a rabid Doberman with AIDS. That is all.(r#24) ","genre":null},{"date":"21 May 2006","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Religion is a dangerous thing.
