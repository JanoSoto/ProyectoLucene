Although its about as far away from the original television series as you can get, there's this retro '60s thing going on with the film which makes it pretty amusing to watch. Although the fact that the cast members are obviously taking everything as a joke does get on your nerves after a while, I consider this to be an enjoyable failure and I must admit that I pretty much enjoyed some of the individual scenes.You know you're in for a crazy time with the film's opening, which sees Steed walking down an apparently normal English street only to be attacked by a number of surprise assailants. For example, at one moment a whistling milkman smashes two empty bottles together to use them as weapons as he lunges as Steed. This exceptionally odd beginning sets the campy tone for the rest of the film, which is not for all tastes it has to be said.Packed with cheesily overemphasised dialogue, lots of one-liners and innuendos worthy of a Bond movie, THE AVENGERS has the benefit of a huge budget to include lots of nifty (but hardly convincing) computer effects. These include an attack by a swarm of mechanical bees, characters walking in see-through bubbles and the climatic storm within a building scene which is sufficiently loud and over-the-top enough to be a crowd-pleasing event. Elsewhere, we have the ever-odd Eddie Izzard as a mute henchman, one of the least threatening ever to grace a cinema (or television) screen, and bad guys dressed up as giant multicoloured teddy bears in order to disguise their identities.Ralph Fiennes (looking a lot like a young version of Peter Cushing) essays the role of the straight-faced John Steed, and is pretty good; Uma Thurman plays the leather-suited Emma Peel one wonders why she agreed to be in such a fantastic movie again after the failure of BATMAN & ROBIN but I guess she's a glutton for punishment. Sean Connery is the non-threatening chief villain, and has had enough experience with Bond villains in order to know how to play it, but his performance is somewhat weak. Elsewhere, we have Jim Broadbent as the wheelchair-bound Mother, leader of the agents, and a funny turn from Patrick Macnee as an invisible agent (!).The major problem is the obvious cutting that went on with the film after initial test screenings, which undoubtedly make events confusing at times. In my mind this just adds to the weirdness. See it for yourself to find out how.

Maybe I'll watch that some time soon, but not right after watching this film. I could go looking for some easy answers - if there are any, which I doubt anyway - but I'd rather stay for now in a moment where I can just ponder everything I watched. It's such a rich and moving experience, and is one of the most unique mystery films I've seen in a very long time - possibly ever.In a way its chief mystery is what it's all about, which remains, possibly, elusive even to the end. Of course we have an idea of the concrete fact that there were two babies born on the same day in different countries, France and Poland, and they grew up to be beautiful young women with dark hair and brown eyes, and looked exactly the same. There's also a moment where the two see each other (one sees the other on a tour bus in Krakow, this in the midst of a protest\/riot in the streets, and yet this other woman on the bus won't see her, at least not yet). Will they try to look for one another is a key question.But Kieslowski is so not interested in anything conventional here. The mystery is about discovering things, but not necessarily the deeper mystery of one knowing for sure the other exists; in other words, this isn't one of those double movies like, say, The Double (2014). We really get two stories here of these women, and they're full-on character portraits the first half hour is dedicated to Weronique, the Polish woman, who is a professional singer (and former piano player) who has a heart condition. The rest of the film focuses on Veronique, who is a music teacher and, after seeing a puppet show performed by a charismatic man named Antoine (or is it Alexandre, one of those), he starts to... stalk her? Follow her in an intriguing way? Certainly he leaves clues for her to find, and when she does... then what? I'd like to make note for a moment music in the film. I don't think it's some flippant artsy choice on the filmmaker's part that each of these people are involved with music. Music is so central to the film, especially when Weronique is singing and becomes her most vulnerable, but also in those moments (on the flip-side image, so to speak) where Veronique isn't paying as close attention to the music she's teaching her students. Notice the opera that Weronique sings comes back more than once, like when Veronique is watching the marionette show. There is significance there, and it may be rooted back into that realm that music can lie with every person - like romance, which this film has, you can't always use the utmost logic ('the heart wants what it wants' so to speak) so why a music moves one person won't necessarily be the same for another. Why is music so paramount for Weronique, while for Veronique it doesn't seem so? Or, is music one of the things that connects them in that elusive, deep-deep down inside sense that they both have? Or maybe they're latent Jedis or something (I kid).How this is all filmed is completely absorbing; Kieslowski uses hand-held camera-work, but in a steady way that often creates tension, like when the two Veroniques are walking out in public (i.e., French side after she leaves her rendezvous with this not-so-mystery man and tries to go through crowded streets, and the Polish side after a rehearsal, where her heart becomes weak and she stumbles to catch her breath). How he uses color is especially breathtaking as well, and not always in ways that forces it but suggests things - red filters and bright whites and yellows here and there (not as blatant as the Colors trilogy, but maybe this was a practice round). So even when things get so enigmatic that it could, in just a few moments, become pretentious, Kieslowski reels it back in and makes the direction vital and important in ways that are unexpected. The camera itself is often another character, which is impressive.I've come all this way and haven't noted that without Irene Jacob this might all not work, or at least as well. There may be a moment here and there where it doesn't seem like she's doing much - she's so beautiful (on the cover I thought for a moment it was Ingrid Bergman with her eyes closed) that one might underestimate how deep and powerful she gets into both these women. The vulnerability is what's so staggering, and how much she feels the moments of joy and wonder, how her face registers genuine curiosity and in seeking out this mystery, and that crucial scene at the café when this Frenchman is revealed, notice how her face changes - it's subtle, but it's really there. I could watch Irene Jacob in this film or Red and see an actress so in tune with the character(s) that she in a way does half the work for Kieslowski. In other words, even when I was wondering, more than once, 'this storyline, such as it is, is getting a little weird and quixotic, maybe for its own good', she really grounded me in the emotional logic, and the pathos becomes so much that it makes something like a scene near the end this mix of heartbreak and bewilderment that I've rarely seen like this in a film.It's at times confounding, in certain choices and moments, but never in ways that might alienate; Kieslowski asks the audience 'come, a little closer - find out more about these women, and whatever the outcome, the journey is genuine and interesting.'

But I will be saying things like the ending is good\/bad so please stop reading if you don't want to see any of that.In short, it is exactly what my summary says Perfect Artwork, Good Acting, Average Story, Bad Storytelling.If you are looking for a masterpiece of an artwork, this is the one. Tragically beautiful, and great choice of style and film score. For a 2000 movie, it is almost a 10\/10 in this aspect.Acting was really closer to average for most characters, but Ellen Burstyn's performance alone is more than enough to make up for any blemishes. I would even suggest anyone to watch the movie just for her acting.Now comes the bad bitThe story is absolutely nothing new. It's simply a confirmation of what most people already knew drugs are bad for you. And that's fine. But the major downside of this movie is that it stops at that (drugs are bad). The characters have absolutely no depth to them. The movie shows close to nothing about their inner struggles and compelling reasons behind taking drugs. They are simply a portrayal of a stereotypical druggie, nothing more; nothing less.What can a person learn from this movie? Nothing at all.

Don Bluth claims a lot of scenes were cut out to follow Lucas' & Spielberg's demands, causing the film to have a very short running time. Fans have tried to find these scenes as best as they could, but I think(if possible) Bluth should try to put out an extended cut of this film. At just 1 hour and 9 minutes, it feels like it could've been so much more, and it doesn't help that Universal could care less about this flick and barely ever bother to try and properly restore it, which is why the Blu-ray and DVDs of this film are crap.Judging from the movie we got, the first and (I wish) only Land Before Time is a charming movie to watch that, despite the mediocre home media transfers, showcases the artistic talent Don Bluth has with its gorgeous animation style and breathtaking visuals. Plus, the late James Horner's film score sounds very beautiful. The voice acting is very good, even if it's a bit unsettling hearing Judith Barsi speaking just 4 months after her unfortunate death. As sad as that is, she does a really good job making Ducky so lovable, it's tragic that we lost such a talented actress when she was so young.What I think brings this movie down is its constant narration. I'd love to see a new version of this movie with the deleted scenes restored, along with every part with the narrator talking over the movie to be cut off. Maybe keep the opening and closing narration, but I think the film would be stronger if the narrator didn't talk over scenes that seriously didn't need a narration to it(the earthquake sequence, Little Foot being sad over his mother, Cera realizing they went the wrong way, etc.).Despite its obvious faults, the current version of The Land Before Time we have now is an okay movie that is very nostalgic to a lot of people. I just think an extended cut with almost all the narration scenes taken out would make the movie even better. I'd probably consider it one of the best animated films ever if this were to happen. Plus, we could get a better video transfer that doesn't look like balls...

However, little did people know at the time of its release, this is the film that would hereby kickoff a series of sequels to the classic 1984 film by playing musical directors, with New Line Cinema acquiring new directors and writers to to etch their own sort of spin on Craven's classic, dream-haunter.Out of all the Nightmare on Elm Street sequels, the first one has a chance at being the most substantial one in the regard that the subtext is more interesting than anything in the way of character relations or legitimate scares. In addition, it also may be the slowest eighty-two minute film I've ever watched, taking its time building up its situation in a way that doesn't feel like the slowburn pacing Craven used for the first film as much as it feels like being just plain slow.The story revolves around Jesse (Mark Patton), who has been waking up soaked in his own sweat for the past several weeks, worrying his family and his best friend Lisa (Kim Myers). Little does anyone, let alone Jesse, know that he is being haunted by Freddy Krueger, the same demon who terrorized Nancy and her friends in the previous film. The shakeup to the story this time around is that Freddy doesn't exactly haunt his victims in their sleep as much as he serves as a repressed identity or sensation - or like a closeted skeleton, ambiguity intended - for Jesse. The repressed identity in question is homosexual and the gay subtext is so blatant in A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 that you could probably watch the film with the sound off and probably get it. Jesse now has the choice to confront the metaphorical and physical demon inside of him as he slowly eats away at his confidence and his mental health throughout the course of the film.A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 gets considerable subversive points for being a film that dared to feature a significant level of homoeroticism - including a scene in an S&M bar as well as a clearly homosexual murder - in a narrative where you'd least expect. If nothing else, this is where Freddy became less a nightmarish boogeyman that just seemed to appear in one's head out of nowhere and more a metaphorical albatross that contributed to the slow and painful deterioration of a young person over time.Director Jack Sholder and writer David Chaskin do all they can to give this gay subtext weight, and the film largely remains interesting for that one idea. To boot, Chaskin infuses one of the best scenes of the franchise, which is the opening sequence here, taking place on your average school bus ride through a typical suburban neighborhood. The nonchalant, unassuming nature of the film that slowly descends into a dimly lit, grim suburban nightmare is the perfect visual representation for the series itself, and cinematographers Jacques Haitkin and Christopher Tufty make this scene's escalation slow and delightfully unexpected.Through all the unexpectedness that Sholder and Chaskin manage to create, they do, however, forget the most fundamental inclusion to the narrative that, if anything, is the most expected and that's making this a horror film. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 is so depressingly mild and largely devoid of scares that it makes everything else questionable as a result. There's no validity to the suspense, nor the immersive buildup here that was in the first film, so what entails is a film that has a real identity crisis in terms of whether or not it caters to substance or caters to its genre.A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge pleasantly takes the series in a different, deeper direction, but its lack of scares and sudden change of rules as to how and why Freddy haunts his victims is a bit jarring, especially when Freddy is such a non-character in his own film.Starring Mark Patton Kim Myers, Robert Englund, and Robert Rusler.

Luckily, she is noticed by Dawson, a mouse who happens to have contacts with Basil of Baker Street, a brilliant (mouse) detective who is at first not interested in the toymaker's capture, until it is linked to his arch-enemy, Ratigan!There are a few aspects of this film that REALLY stand out Vincent Price as Ratigan, and Henry Mancini's score.

His performance as the villain in this film is absolutely brilliant.
