All of the stock characters are represented -- the jock, the nerds, the beautiful cheerleader,  the shallow best friends, the white wanna-be homeboys -- but, as in American Pie, are given enough human dimension that they're plausible and fun to watch.  The movie's entertaining from start to finish, refreshingly irony and angst-free, and the ending is cute as can be.The other type of people under 30 are those who take their movie-watching very seriously.  They don't have time for fun, silly movies, and they viciously rip them apart because they aren't perfect.  They hated American Pie because it had semen humor, they loathed 10 Things because it blasphemed Shakespeare, and they wouldn't think of buying a ticket to a movie called She's All That.

Some think there should be a large series of AUSTIN POWERS movies, like the infamous Bond movies. Trust me, I'm kinda sick of everyone doing impressions of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, (and I do one fine Dr. Evil if I do say so myself, even though both are easy to impersonate), but I thought AUSTIN POWERS THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME was even better than the first one. So if you asked me if there should be a series of AUSTIN POWERS movies, and I wasn't so sick of all those impersonations, I might say Yeah baby!Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is sent back to 1969 by Basil Exposition (Michael York) to stop Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) who has stolen Austin Powers' mojo and plans to build a giant laser on the movie and destroy all major cities on Earth. In the sixties, Austin Powers meets Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), who is just as sexy and hip as Austin is. Scott Evil (Seth Green) is still trying to work out things with his father, even though Dr. Evil has turned his attention to his clone in 1\/10 size, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). Number Two (Robert Wagner, then Rob Lowe), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling) and Mustafa (Will Ferrell) all return to help Dr. Evil, in addition to Fat Bastard (Mike Myers), the disgusting, overweight, Scottish henchman.Let's face is, Austin Powers has never been about plot. Considering that this movie is basically a spoof of OUR MAN FLINT and the JAMES BOND movies, the plot is pretty entertaining and funny. The giant laser on the moon was great, obviously spoofing MOONRAKER, in addition to many other movies of its type.The acting in this movie is all very good. Mike Myers does a great job playing three very different characters. Heather Graham beats the crap out of Elizabeth Hurley (not literally in this movie, but how cool would that be) and is way sexier in my book. Seth Green and Mindy Sterling are great, especially when together. Will Ferrell was one of my favorite performers and characters in this movie. Robert Wagner is good, but his role is taken over by Rob Lowe after they go back in time. Lowe does an unbelievable job and is almost exactly like Wagner was as the character. Michael York does a fairly good job too. There are some great cameos by names like Clint Howard, Tim Robbins, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Kristen Johnston and Jerry Springer.Unlike in AUSTIN POWERS INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY, there is great character development. This first AUSTIN POWERS movie did a good job laying a foundation for these characters, but this movie really set them off. Dr. Evil stole the show, which is great because he is obviously the best character. Austin Powers, Number Two and Basil are about the same as in the first one. Felicity is way more interesting and sexier than Hurley was. Frau is much more interesting in this movie, as is Scott who is still saying Why don't you just kill them? to his father. Mustafa, who you might not even remember from the first one, is hilarious in this movie. Mini-Me was fun, but in the next AUSTIN POWERS movie, it shouldn't revolve around him as much. Fat Bastard is my least favorite character and I hope he isn't in the next AUSTIN POWERS movie.Go see this one, you won't regret it. It sure won't win any Oscars, but it's one of the funniest movies of the year. Turn your brain off and enjoy it!

I'm sure there have been others - though written by, of all people, Joel Schumacher, I've always thought of 1976's Car Wash as the grand-daddy of them. It's also become a benchmark for stoners; for the 20th anniversary, it was screened for a special event on 4\/20. Sadly, I couldn't attend full of the green stuff, but it was still an enjoyable experience seeing it again. Not great, but good.For all of the comparisons to it being Boyz N tha Hood as a crude comedy, that it is in part. But it's also like the Watts equivalent of something closer Clerks, also by first-time filmmakers it's mostly about two guys who don't have much going on with their lives or prospects or action, but they're surrounded by so many 'lively' personalities and moments that are meant to get BIG laughs, regardless of a story structure that is super-strong outside of the Day-In-The-Life thing. And both borrow of course from Do the Right Thing, though Cube actually goes for his own version of the violent climax with a fight. The lack of any cops shows this is a fairly insulated world. Works for me.If it doesn't really have the same existential heft as Clerks, well, it's not fully trying to be that anyway. What we get here also, of course, is the breakthrough for Chris Tucker - an opportunity he'd only really pursue for another few years before spending his life, it appears, on Rush Hour checks (and a surprise guest spot in Silver Linings Playbook, of all things). His work here is still electrifying and high-charged, though maybe this time I saw more of the obvious tics of the character (like, we get it, the Angel Dust bit is one of the major highlights of the movie, but can't you move on?) And Cube is good as straight man for Tucker's foole, and has a few moments too.This is one of those movies I watched a LOT 'back in the day' as one might say. It's really a movie, despite being rated R, for 13 year olds, black or white, and seeing it at 13 made as big an impression as seeing Clerks or Pulp Fiction or whatever. At the time I thought it was that good on the level. But some things do last better than others, and the seams in Friday show much more over time. Some bits don't work - the crackhead (?) hustler is hit or miss, mostly great in the HEY, SMOKY BACk HERE TAKING A S***! bit - though Tony Lister, DEEBO of course in capital letters, is still amazing. And I found myself laughing often through the film, in part due to things still working, like anything with Bernie Mac (and Tony Cox!), and sometimes just nostalgia. It surprised me just how much I remembered in terms of dialog - if only I remembered everything from school like this, I'd be probably a smarter man today... oh well.Bottom line, enough of it holds up to recommend as a fun comedy, but the effect of 20 years of stoner\/hood\/black comedies have diluted some of its effectiveness; any time Craig narrated, or that quick montage of 'things that happened today' right before the fight, drag the movie down. And why do they go OUTSIDE knowing that the drive-by is going to happen? That they might shoot the houses whether or not they're there?

I was a Mike Myers fan, but AUSTIN POWERS INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY looked like the stupidest and least creative movie of the year. But after hearing of a few of the hilarious scenes of the movie, I decided to test my faith in Myers and give it a try. It turned out to be one of the funniest movies I'd seen in a long time.The swinging hipster from the 60's, Austin Powers (Mike Myers), puts himself in deep freeze for thirty years to pursue his archenemy, Dr. Evil (Mike Myers). He is thawed out in the 90's when Dr. Evil finally reappears and plans to drill a missile to the center of the earth and destroy the planet core, and then the world. Austin Powers, with the help of his true love Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), must find a way to stop Dr. Evil and shag Vanessa. But Dr. Evil has some very dangerous customers working for him, such as Number Two (Robert Wagner), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Mustafa (Will Ferrell) and his son Scott Evil (Seth Green) who thinks his father should just kill Austin rather than make a complicated plan to get rid of him.The plot of this movie is a big spoof of movies such as the JAMES BOND films, so it's not expected to be anything but funny, which it certainly is. Don't listen to people who say this is for middle-school kids, people of all ages can enjoy this movie. It should also be said that Dr. Evil is a terrific character because, in addition to being very funny, is the stereotype spy-movie bad guy.The acting in this movie is pretty good. Mike Myers plays both Austin Power and Dr. Evil, two very different characters, very well. Elizabeth Hurley does a very good job as Austin's girlfriend. Both Seth Green, who I think has a long, successful career ahead of him, and Mindy Sterling are very funny. Robert Wagner and Michael York, two Hollywood veterans, do good jobs with the small parts they have. Will Farrell is underplayed in this movie, but it very funny in the scene he is in. The Fembots, by the way, are terrific.This movie is destined to become a movie classic, and Yeah baby! will be a catch phrase that will be remembered years from now. Austin Power and Dr. Evil are both stereotype symbols of past movies. Basically, these two guys are symbols of American film, at least for that particular genre. Don't expect much out of this movie except for a good laugh and a good time and you won't be disappointed.

This is a very brief lowdown on the plot. The outline of the story is actually pretty good.

But overall it wasn't such a bad movie, with some nice elements. Being that those elements reside completely on Kevin Spacey, and in some lesser form on Samuel L. Jackson.

Add to this, some silly, mood-shattering fantasy sequences (one in which the couple are joined in bed by their respective parents is particularly inappropriate and ill-advised) and one of the least convincing resolutions in movie history and you have a real recipe for cinematic disaster.This film establishes Reiner as one of the most uneven directors working today, able to produce works of real romantic quality like The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally, and The American President, then turn right around and deliver utter artistic disasters like North and now The Story of Us.

A sequel that is as good as the first one without being a remake! Both real Batman movies are cartoonishly violent (that is by no means an insult), SF (Science Fiction) comic book fantasies.  That's what makes them great.  They are intelligent but don't try to shoot for the Oscars or try to satisfy the legions of critics who hate films that are just escapist fare. Batman movies are supposed to a few hours of fun for the legions of innocent Batman fights to protect.  Anyway, this film\/movie is a blast.  The set designs and directing make this film beautiful to stare at for hours.  The acting is great-Everyone from Christopher Walken to Michael Keaton turns in a top-notch performancec and would have all been show stealers if they had been without each other's support.  Gotham City is a dark and dangerous place where diabolical Penguins can run for Mayor, anonymous citizens scurry fearfully about, and the only person to protect us all is the Caped Crusader. It is up there with Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Blade Runner's LA. The score only makes this movie even better.  The directing just makes the atmosphere even thicker.

A visually striking, idea-filled wonder, Run Lola Run is a pure burst of random energy, even more so than another underrated film, The Matrix. For roughly 80 minutes, writer\/director\/composer Tom Twyker delivers the action movie goods at a non-stop pace in as intelligent a manner in recent memory.Everything fits together here, in the story and the film. The acting is first rate. The thumping techno score keeps the film rollicking. And the photography, editing, and direction are breathless. The film opens with a bravura shot of people in a crowd, as we briskly hear each of them spew out a philosophical remark on the nature of time before moving to another. This scene recalls Wim Wenders's Wings of Desire, and proves itself an incredibly effective way to open the movie. Twyker wants his audience to know exactly what they're dealing with, while keeping them desperately wanting more. He succeeds.The plot quickly unravels within the film's first few minutes. Manni, a German punk, is in quite a bit of trouble, owing some mobsters 100,000 marks in 20 minutes (mocking the generic 20- minutes-to-live plot staple) after preceding to board the subway (a la Sliding Doors), and in a bit of frenzy, leaving the cash behind. The only one he can turn to is his girlfriend Lola (who is partially to blame). She must think fast and race against the clock to save her boyfriend's skin. Don't worry, I haven't given away the whole plot, this is merely the set-up. What can Lola do? Where can she turn?From this point, Run Lola Run takes a turn into the fantastic. Director Twyker gives us a plot twist right out of the aforementioned Sliding Doors, Rashomon, or even Groundhog Day. We see the situation of Lola desperately running to save her boyfriend's life play out three different ways until it finally succeeds. Failure in the first two situations add another intriguing concept (one which I will not reveal), that recalls the premise of the 1999 film After Life. These scenes wonderfully illustrate the film's powerful message love is stronger than death.The film never loses its speed, refusing to never drop below a blur for more than 3 minutes. One of the best aspects Run Lola Run has going for it is its sense of humor. There are little touches of it sprinkled throughout, including numerous recurring sight gags and that priceless last line. Also included are amazing wit, irony, symbolism, and paradox, that push the film into the category of those that demand multiple viewings. This is original filmmaking, that at several points, switches to animation. Don't blink, because there are fantastic themes and ideas explored here. Take for example the question, how might one little random happening in your day affect your destiny? The movie explores this, thrice over.What is time? What controls our destiny? The answers to these questions may never be uncovered, but at least Run Lola Run tries to help us on our way. Breaking the film down proves it to be a symmetrical, thought-provoking, hilarious foreign film masterpiece. Some call this nothing more than an MTV music video, with its quick cuts and zooming camera. I reply to those people, When was the last time an MTV music video explored the very roots of human existence?This is the second best foreign film of 1999, right behind Pedro Almodovar's classic All About My Mother. Tom Twyker has established himself as one of the top non-American directors (and writers and composers) out there today.

You might say I was in Son of Sam's target demographic.To say I was grossly disappointed would be an understatement.  First, this film was deftly misrepresented as a story about the 44 Caliber Killer, when in fact it was really a slice of New York life in 1977.  The killings served as a more of a psychological backdrop to the story than the story itself.  In fact, the Berkowitz gets little more treatment here than the New York Yankees.After I resigned myself to the fact that this was really a story about the lives of half a dozen New Yorkers in the seventies, I tried to enjoy it as a period piece.  The trouble is, it was not a good period piece.  This was more of a caricature of New York in the seventies than a realistic portrayal.  Spike Lee, who is usually known for his stark realism has produced a lampoon of the era, (probably without intending to).As a period piece it was hit and miss.  The wardrobe and hairstyles were all wrong for that period.  Bell bottoms were still a mainstream style back then. Despite the burgeoning of the disco generation, hard rockers were the majority and were not in evidence in the film.  Punk was very fringe yet it was treated as if it were mainstream.  Hair was styled and much longer.  You seldom saw anyone's ears.  The majority of men in New York, particularly Italians, had moustaches.  I didn't see one white male with facial hair in the whole movie.  Generally, the look in the film was more of New York in the late 80's.On the plus side, the vernacular was fairly true to form.  Most of the New York accents were well done, although there were not enough of yeah right and fugetaboutit which was really quite prevalent back then.  We also didn't hear much of New York's trademark sarcasm.  They did use a few words only used in New York like `schkieve' (to make one's skin crawl, usually with disgust) and `skank' (an ugly woman) which you normally don't hear in movies.  It was really true that for a while, the restaurant and night club business was in the tank in New York.  Those types of businesses on Long Island saw a surge as a lot of New Yorkers would go to the Island for entertainment, since Berkowitz was a city killer.  This allusion was never made in the film.The story itself meandered and seemed content to portray New York life, without really having much point.  There were a few good scenes, such as the one where Vinny (John Leguizamo) was begging Dionna (Mira Sorvino) not to leave him as she was packing, but most of the writing was hack and overly stereotyped.  At two and a half hours, it was far too long.John Leguizamo gave a strong performance, though he looked more Puerto Rican than Italian.  Michael Rispoli plays the New York Italian perfectly (I don't think he has to do much acting) and his was one of the best performances in the film.  Mira Sorvino was terrific as Vinny's wife.  She was just exactly the right mix of insecure good girl trying not to be so good, and the fuming betrayed wife.  Though her accent wasn't the best, her behavior and mannerisms were very New York middle class.As for Spike Lee, this was probably the most mediocre film I've seen by him.  He toned down his creative use of the camera and he wasn't attentive to realistic details that usually mark his films.I rated this film a 4\/10.  It was a poor masquerade for a New York story.

You might say I was in Son of Sam's target demographic.To say I was grossly disappointed would be an understatement.  First, this film was deftly misrepresented as a story about the 44 Caliber Killer, when in fact it was really a slice of New York life in 1977.  The killings served as a more of a psychological backdrop to the story than the story itself.  In fact, the Berkowitz gets little more treatment here than the New York Yankees.After I resigned myself to the fact that this was really a story about the lives of half a dozen New Yorkers in the seventies, I tried to enjoy it as a period piece.  The trouble is, it was not a good period piece.  This was more of a caricature of New York in the seventies than a realistic portrayal.  Spike Lee, who is usually known for his stark realism has produced a lampoon of the era, (probably without intending to).As a period piece it was hit and miss.  The wardrobe and hairstyles were all wrong for that period.  Bell bottoms were still a mainstream style back then. Despite the burgeoning of the disco generation, hard rockers were the majority and were not in evidence in the film.  Punk was very fringe yet it was treated as if it were mainstream.  Hair was styled and much longer.  You seldom saw anyone's ears.  The majority of men in New York, particularly Italians, had moustaches.  I didn't see one white male with facial hair in the whole movie.  Generally, the look in the film was more of New York in the late 80's.On the plus side, the vernacular was fairly true to form.  Most of the New York accents were well done, although there were not enough of yeah right and fugetaboutit which was really quite prevalent back then.  We also didn't hear much of New York's trademark sarcasm.  They did use a few words only used in New York like `schkieve' (to make one's skin crawl, usually with disgust) and `skank' (an ugly woman) which you normally don't hear in movies.  It was really true that for a while, the restaurant and night club business was in the tank in New York.  Those types of businesses on Long Island saw a surge as a lot of New Yorkers would go to the Island for entertainment, since Berkowitz was a city killer.  This allusion was never made in the film.The story itself meandered and seemed content to portray New York life, without really having much point.  There were a few good scenes, such as the one where Vinny (John Leguizamo) was begging Dionna (Mira Sorvino) not to leave him as she was packing, but most of the writing was hack and overly stereotyped.  At two and a half hours, it was far too long.John Leguizamo gave a strong performance, though he looked more Puerto Rican than Italian.

A G-rated David Lynch movie? However, I trust Lynch to never let me down with a watered-down movie, and once again my faith was borne out. I'm glad this movie recieved that rating, because EVERYONE should see this film.It works on so many levels, I plan to see it at least twice more just so I can pick them all out. The central theme of the movie is The Journey, the literal one that was taken by Alvin Straight and the metaphorical one which everyone takes through life. The recurring image in the film of the stars slowly advancing, which is always displayed when someone is sitting still, indicates that even when you're doing nothing, you're still travelling, both literally and figuratively.Everyone in the movie does a superb job, especially Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek, who starts off as one of Lynch's cartoonish, oddball people who always pop up in his movies, and then develops through the movie into a fully fleshed-out human. This role, as well as her role in Affliction, reveals Spacek to be one of, if not the most underrated actors working today.There is the usual Lynchian imagery and characters, and some of the best cinematography and scenery I've seen since Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter. Where Egoyan's film was starkly beautiful, however, this one is varied, showing all the colours and textures of rural America in the last days of summer. Sheer magnificence.The moods are well-balanced. At different times one is laughing, horrified, saddened, but most of all it is affirming.For people who see Lynch as just a purveyor of weirdness, this will either be a refreshing change or a disappointment. But people who see film as a true art form will be overjoyed by this simple, yet beautiful, bit of storytelling by an artist who is obviously developing and continuing to mature and improve on his craft. Lynch has taken an inspirational story and packed it with so much more that this has now displaced Being John Malkovich as my favourite movie of the year. These two movies have proven that film is still a vital art form, and in the age of grand spectacle movies with no real plot or acting, this is food for a very hungry soul. 99 was a great year, let's hope it continues.

Some could argue that he's just like R2-D2 or Yoda, but they don't really get on your nerves they way he does. Then there's the ugly fact that many of the aliens in Phantom Menace resembled certain ethnic groups. The Trade Federation aliens sounded unmistakably Oriental. The Gungans sounded (and in the case of their leader, looked) vaguely Jamaican. There is some explaining to be done. Also, the screenplay doesn't allow for much character development, if any. If the acting seems poor, don't blame the actors. It's the script's fault. And, although polished and well done, the special effects are, really, nothing special. Remember that when Star Wars came out, no one had ever seen anything like it. The computer animation and digital effects in Phantom Menace are good, very good, but they're not revolutionary. The entire movie is just not up to Star Wars' standards. This movie is geared toward a younger target audience than any of the others. In fact, it's almost a children's movie. The two aren't in the same class. Star Wars was nominated for, among other awards, Best Picture, and Best Screenplay.

And the final lightsaber dual between the two Jedi and Darth Maul is superb. I think that it's George Lucas's own fault that Phantom Menace was not as popular as Star Wars.

The entire movie is just not up to Star Wars' standards. This movie is geared toward a younger target audience than any of the others. In fact, it's almost a children's movie. The two aren't in the same class. Star Wars was nominated for, among other awards, Best Picture, and Best Screenplay. The only awards Phantom Menace has a chance of being nominated for are the technical ones. And those aren't guaranteed wins, either. Of course, the movie has good points, too. The cast (with the notable exception of Jake Lloyd) is excellent, Liam Neeson, Ewan MacGregor and Natalie Portman standing out. And the final lightsaber dual between the two Jedi and Darth Maul is superb. I think that it's George Lucas's own fault that Phantom Menace was not as popular as Star Wars. First re-releasing the original trilogy, then coming up with the special edition, all designed to make people interested in Star Wars again. But it worked too well. He got people's expectations up so high that no movie could have satisfied them. It's a shame. But I'm waiting eagerly for Episode II anyway. George Lucas knows what he's doing, and I wouldn't be surprised if Episode II knocks everyone's socks off. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"}]
