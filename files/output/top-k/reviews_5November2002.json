The relationship between Arlo and Zero is also one of the greatest depictions of a working friendship.

The film finds humor in the most unexpected places and the tension is built from the very first frame.  But, once again calling on the New York setting, those hostages have to be the most annoying ones in the history of cinema.  There were a few times I was actually rooting for the hijackers because of this!  It was somewhat hard to buy Martin Balsam as one of the hijackers, but he's the only one that Robert Shaw's Mr. Blue seems to respect.  And I'm not giving away anything by saying that the movie has unusual fates for all of the terrorists.

But, hopefully, you already expect this. But this movie could have been a little bit scary, or at the very least fun. But it's not.\tFirst, let's get the good points of the movie out of the way. This won't take long. The movie's major pull is the gore. And it has some gore that is inspired. Blood and death. Not enough to make it worth the 90 minutes, however, but there are some nice moments. Also, the premise is interesting. Not the plot, but the premise. There's a house with glass walls and violent ghosts. Nothing earth shattering here, but interesting. Some of the ghosts have themselves interesting back stories. These aren't explored in the film, but they have names that hint at something, and they look cool. The set design and make up are also good. There's one or two good 'jump' scares (but another two hundred that fail).\tThat's about it. Thirteen Ghosts has four major failings, or five if you count the child, who apart from being very annoying is the worst cast child actor since Ruthie in 7th Heaven. Firstly, it takes itself way too seriously. It attempts a couple of plot twists and tries to give us some sympathy for the characters. It's hard to care whether they live or die- some characters you want dead- but there are attempts made to make us care. These attempts fail. Then there's the complete lack of atmosphere, which is something that all good horror movies need. I believe The Sixth Sense was overrated, but this beats this movie by so much. The choice for a glass house was an attempt to make this movie modern, rather than having a big, old, creepy house on a hill. But big, old, creepy houses on hills are atmospheric and in the right hands, scary. Dark Castle's first movie (this is it's second, I think) was The House on Haunted Hill. That was also nearly as cheesy as this movie, but it had atmosphere as well as just gore.\tThirdly, there's the fact that we have twelve ghosts here. Yes, the title is thirteen ghosts, but there are twelve. There is a story saying who the thirteenth ghost is and what they do but it's too silly to go into in any detail. But, we have twelve ghosts, and the majority of them do nothing. About four of them actually cause harm, and another has significance to the characters, but the rest we only see fleetingly. They perhaps bang on the glass a little to shock the characters or stand at the end of a hallway, but that's it. This movie could have had many more scenes with characters being chased or at the very least scared by these ghosts, but it doesn't. There is a lot of untapped potential.\tFinally- and this is what robbed the film of being at all scary- there's the editing. The editor must have swallowed thirteen ecstasy tablets before starting work on the movie. The editing robs the audience of having any chance of getting a sense of the house. The house could have been really cool, but the camera cuts so much, and speeds up, and snaps between seeing the ghosts and not, and it makes it impossible to know where the characters are in comparison to each other and a possible escape route. Most of the movie could effectively have been shot in one length of corridor, instead of wasting money building the maze on the set that they did. Instead of the tracking though the house, we get millisecond cuts of various identical looking glass rooms with monstrous ghosts mugging the camera. Instead of the ghosts being introduced in a way that gives them menace, we get a FLASH, FLASH, FLASH introduction. All attempts to scare come from a quick cut to a ghost with a loud noise, rather than having some sort of build up. Also, all the scenes with characters actually getting attacked never run their full length. They are always have other scenes cut into them, and this ruins any effect they may have had. In the end it just gets irritating.\tThirteen Ghosts (or Thir13en Ghosts, as it is often stupidly called) did have potential. It was never going to be brilliant, and no one expects it to be. Plot holes and bad acting are practically considered a necessary element in the post-Scream wave of horror movies. But it could have been so much better. If you want a movie that's scary, get Halloween. If you want a movie that's fun and gory, get Evil Dead 2.

The new movie was intended to ignore the camp comedy of the popular 1966 TV series, and reinvent the Caped Crusader as the dark vigilante of the comic books.  The Batman in this movie has no Robin and is a very brutal and no-nonsense figure.  He was to remain like this for two movies under Tim Burton, before being lightened up considerably under new director Joel Schumacher.Set in the beleaguered, crime-ridden town of Gotham City, Batman begins with a clueless family wandering up the wrong alley looking for a taxi after a night out at the theatre.  They are duly mugged by a pair of ruffians.  As they go through their stash in a rooftop hideout, Batman (Michael Keaton) descends from the sky and dishes out some much-deserved punishment on the two of them before vanishing into the night.Meanwhile, city hoodlum Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) is set up by his boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance), after sleeping with his girlfriend (Jerry Hall).  During a raid at a chemical factory, Napier struggles with Batman before falling to his apparent death in a vat of acid.  Napier survives, his skin white, his hair green and his face a permanent grin.  He becomes the Joker, as he kills Grissom and takes over his criminal empire.Batman is the most well thought-out of all of the Batman movies.  The editing and plot are coherent and easy to follow, the sets are grim and daunting, and the music (from the start to finish) is pitch-perfect for the picture and wonderfully accentuates every scene. The action set-pieces fast-paced and exciting, with a brilliant finale atop a 1,000 foot tall cathedral.The performances are something of a mixed bag.  Michael Keaton's much overlooked performance as Batman, and his alter-ego millionaire Bruce Wayne, lends a subtlety and depth to the picture.  By the end a bruised and battered Batman has the audience on his side.  Jack Nicholson, unfortunately, really overdoes it as the Joker.  He's perfect at playing the sadistic villain, and has a really memorable wild cackle, but his character lacks a human dimension that would really round him out. Kim Basinger is adequate and does have some chemistry as Bruce Wayne's love interest, reporter Vicki Vale, but she could have been sexier and alot less shallow.  Robert Wuhl, as Vale's fellow reporter, is here largely as comic relief but although he could have been funnier, his prescence brings an appropriately lighthearted touch to the picture.

The `mystery' is in where all the surrounding characters fall, in which film, and ultimately with which film will `win.'Following the Lynch formula (Gayton and Caruso are clever but no artists) the end is a merger of the two film types. Chaos meets self-destruction.I imagine that Caruso worked hard to balance the two film genres, probably talking to each actor separately. Probably keeping a scorecard one `thriller' plot twist = one comic drug hallucination.Along the way, we get a few self-referential devices. These are also requirements of this new form a reference to Zapruder -- a film that supports two truths and by extension the fabricated documentary of Stone and his plastic realities. A reference to Bob Hope's crap (read films) and a plot to coopt it. Lot's of references to other films `Do you feel lucky?' A `performance' within Guzman and Unger work their own little embedded film. Another Kujo creates his own embedded heist film.Its all fun if you love movies. A little sad to see Kilmer's commitment taken advantage of so, but that's the tragedy of the thing. These guys are doomed to unhappy lives unless they cease to act, like DeNiro.It's a fun and clever example of a new type of synthesized, self-referential film, but there's nothing new or particularly lifealtering here.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.

Could he repeat the success? No. Could he still do a decent movie, a cut above the rest? Yes.It's all about a killer. A top detective, Dormer (Al Pacino), along with his partner Eckhart (Martin Donavan), is called in to assist in a murder in remote Alaska. They're assisted by the local police officer Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), who is a big fan of Dormer. Well and good. The two detectives have a secret shared between them, which allows for some creative, character building friction. You want a twist? Got it - there's a few. Firstly, there's the whole `insomnia' element - Alaska is in a 24-hour sun period, which Dormer cannot adjust to. Therefore he's constantly awake, and as the hunt continues, getting more and more tired - and more and more likely to mistake. Speaking of mistakes - he makes a big one (which I can't reveal) but which has dramatic consequences (not to mention character introspecting and building). This allows the movie to take a path, which is somewhat unexpected (for a bit), especially when we see how far Dormer is willing to go. It's all let down a bit by a final fifteen minutes which is, if nothing else, too dully Hollywood predictable. Oh well.So the script's good but not excellent. Certainly not a patch on `Memento' as it has none of its mystery or suspense. It's essentially a cop\/bad-guy story with the insomnia twist, and doesn't feature any spectacularly memorable moments. So why is it above average? The performances help for one. Al Pacino is the perfect person to play an insomniac - his drooping eyes are suited to Dormer. Yes he does his usual, appearing to sleep through his roles, but it suits the Dormer character and so he's well chosen. Swank is a bit disappointing - it's not a fault of her acting abilities, but more of a character that seems decidedly under-developed. All we know is that she's a fan of Dormer, but out to prove herself and make a mark. Not original. Robin Williams is of course the most talked about actor here, casting himself against type as a villain. He's remarkably restrained. I normally loathe his `comedy' roles, and kept expecting him to burst into goofy gestures and rambling nonsense, but he keeps himself in, gives himself a quiet dignity, undercut with a credible sense of menace. It'll make his role in `One Hour Photo' interesting to see. His character is also reasonably interesting, let down again by the weak finale.So how does Nolan, master editor, work out here? He's good. There is a nice repeated image that, like elements of `Memento', only makes full sense later on. There're some great cuts and moments indicating Pacino's extreme fatigue - still camera work, sound being drowned out, and so forth. Certainly Nolan knows how to do his visuals and work with the beautiful Alaskan (and British Columbian) landscape to create stark images (which are, of course, also metaphorical). His use of lighting - a necessity in this movie - is good, and a nice contrast with light being used where dark would normally be the enemy. It's his work, along with the actors, that lifts up the movie into the `well worth watching' category.I was, in the end, a little bit disappointed with `Insomnia'. It's not half as clever as `Memento', presumably having to pander more towards typical Hollywood sensibilities (it appears that it deviates from the original to make it more audience friendly). The lack of a stronger script is offset by some fine acting and assured direction. I look forward to seeing what Nolan does next, just not with quite the same eagerness as I did before this. 8\/10.

I enjoyed Live and Let Die(The first Moore film I saw), but after two Brosnan films, I slightly questioned his role as Bond. But it was great in this one.The story is about two submarines that mysteriously disappear. James Bond of MI6 and KGB agent Anya Amasova are both sent on a mission to locate them by acquiring a special microfilm. The interaction between these two characters is very funny and is one of Bond's best relationships. From Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean, the film keeps you excited and entertained with well done scenes, including Bond's car battle with Stromberg's henchmen. And the scene on the Luparis is awesome, with a lot of action that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The Spy Who Loved Me also has a great ending scene, but I can't say what it is!

And the scene on the Luparis is awesome, with a lot of action that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The Spy Who Loved Me also has a great ending scene, but I can't say what it is! You'll have to find out for yourself.So if you're looking for a Bond movie that's fun to watch, or if you just want a great show, get this movie. I'm not sure whether it's better than Goldeneye, but it's too good to be true. Out of five stars, I give it four.

But by the end, I loved it. It ran so smoothly and had great sequences, a good theme song, and another classic Q scene. It had perfect villains such as Karl Stromberg and the unforgettable Jaws. I give a lot of credit to Richard Kiel for his spectacular performance as Jaws. Not only did he do a good job, but I became a little more accustomed to Roger Moore. I enjoyed Live and Let Die(The first Moore film I saw), but after two Brosnan films, I slightly questioned his role as Bond. But it was great in this one.The story is about two submarines that mysteriously disappear. James Bond of MI6 and KGB agent Anya Amasova are both sent on a mission to locate them by acquiring a special microfilm.

Originally it was as `hard as nails' as you were likely to get, featuring Gene Hackman as a tough cop, Jimmy `Popeye' Doyle. He'll do anything he needs to solve the case!!The case here is about drugs. There's a French connection involved. but you may have guessed that. There's actually very little plot at all. Nowadays you would need to inject a few twists and turns - the plot here wouldn't extend much beyond a one hour showing of a TV program. It's not boring as such, or told lazily, it just gently drifts along without any real hurry (despite a couple of car chases). No particular points here - it may have been sharp and cutting edge in its day. but not now and its by those standards I am forced to judge.Gene `I'm well 'ard' Hackman is good here. He ought to be - he won an Oscar for his role. He's very convincing as the tough-no-nonsense cop, and has a mean determined streak in him that's conveyed well. It's not the same as the surly laconic wit of Dirty Harry - this guy is genuinely hard. I can't fault his winning an Oscar for the role here. The others, such as Ray `Seaquest DSV' Schneider all are good, but overshadowed by Hackman's energy.Other qualities of the movie? There's a famous car chase - and it is good. It's well directed by William Friedkin (who won an Oscar here), and matches most of the car chases filmed since in terms of viewer involvement, tension, and speed (although one or two of the elements have since become clichés of the genre). Friedkin adapts a very murky, downbeat tone to the movie which works for the most, although it does make the dialog irritatingly difficult to hear at times. Certainly his work is in keeping with the script's tone, and I can see why he got his Oscar for it (though personally I thought Kubrick was far far more deserving that year). The film, being a reflection of its time,  hasn't always aged that well but that can't be ruled against it too much (except in terms of its impact).I expected more from `The French Connection' than I got. Yes the directing is pretty good, and Hackman is excellent. but there's not all that much substance to it. Being gritty doesn't qualify as actually having depth. The car chase, its most famous attribute, is well done but hardly outstanding given today's technology. It's a landmark in the sense of Hollywood rewarding a more adult movie (after `Midnight Cowboy') but not a classic. 7\/10.
