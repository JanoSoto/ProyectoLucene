I will also admit that I was a little skeptical of this film because I'd never heard of director, Phil Alden Robinson before, and that kind of scared me.  I loved directors John McTiernan (HFRO) and Phillip Noyce (PG and CAPD) from the other Jack Ryan films, and I just hoped that Phil Alden Robinson could do as good of a job.  I have to say that I was impressed, I thought the movie was very well done and definitely kept me interested.  This movie is definitely one of those films that I'm going to need to see two or three times before I fully understand it (I don't do so well with the political thrillers).  So, I look forward to seeing it again, and hopefully pick up on some things that I didn't catch in the first round.  All the actors in this film did a great job with their roles.  I don't think there was a single actor in the film that I didn't like.  Ben Affleck did a great job as Jack Ryan and Morgan Freeman did a great job as Bill Cabot.  I also really liked Liev Schreiber as John Clark.   The only complaint I have about the film is that I wish they hadn't shown any of the nuclear explosion scenes in the trailers\/previews for the film.  It would definitely have had more of an impact if they hadn't shown any of those scenes in the trailer.  But, oh well, it still got me in the theater right?  Well, I want to say that if you liked the other Jack Ryan films then you'll probably like this one, but I know that everybody's opinions are different, so I hope you like the film as much as I did.

Although the film doesn't reach the brilliance of Fight Club and Se7en, it's a very enjoyable film with great performances by all the actors.The story is known, so I won't spend any time on it here. Koepp's script is no Academy Award winner, but surprisingly clever for a big-budget film. God knows we've seen enough (too) simple scripts turned into box-office smash-hits. And Fincher knows what to do with it. He lets the camera spin, fly, move through the house, ceilings, walls and floors. Very close to Fight Club, these camera-moves.Another great thing is that we never leave the house during the actual story. From the moment we take a look (with the characters) in the house, we stay there. That's also a good thing. We learn to know the house along with Meg and her daughter.The villains aren't the most clever people alive. One times, when Meg does something (won't say it here), Raoul says Why didn't we do that? and that makes the character more human than the average Euro-terrorists who dominate action films so much. People I know said the burglars made stupid mistakes. Well, people make stupid mistakes.Minor things I liked the opening credits. Brilliant. Perfect. The weaknesses of Meg and her daughter. They aren't perfect, just like the bad-guys and that makes them human and we can relate to them.One thing I didn't like (and now the spoiler comes) The final scene. We see Meg and her daughter on a bench in a park, looking for a new house. In my opinion it didn't add anything to the movie and we left the house. I'd like us to stay in the house until the very end.In general this is a great film, has its minor flaws, but they are compensated with a clever script, great performances, terrific camera work, perfect direction and the house itself, which I thought was one of the main characters. It might be a little bit of a safe bet for Fincher to do a big studio film. Personally I'd like to see him more risky projects, like Se7en and Fight Club, but he does a great job here and gives me confidence in Fincher doing Mission Impossible 3, like the rumors are.

The only thing this film really has going for it is a morbid curiosity involving a nuclear blast on American soil.  In the wake of September 11, I can certainly appreciate that.  In New York City, I can certainly appreciate that.  But when that morbid curiosity is all the suspense that the film has going for it, then I have to vote thumbs down on the film. Understand, I went to this film really wanting to like it.  But the nuclear blast happens about half way through the film, and after, there is absolutely no suspense.  YOU know that Jack Ryan is ultimately going to save the world.  So, what does this film have? Well, first of all, we have Morgan Freeman turning in yet another faxed in performance, which, by this time, is to be expected (Do I really need to keep paying him to do the same thing over, and over, and over, and over, and over again?  One is hard pressed to remember the days of DRIVING MISS DAISY, GLORY, and LEAN ON ME ... when he actually acted!).  I dare say he has not done one even remotely interesting performance since SEVEN. Next, we have Liev Schreiber - stepping in for Willem DaFoe who originally played the same part in the vastly superior CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.  Mr. Schreiber, however, seems to be playing a character - not a viewpoint like the rest of the cast.   Then we have the rest of the cast - a who's who of top notch character actors.  We have Bruce McGill, Ron Rifkin, and James Cromwell.  All they get to do is present various (sometimes utterly inane) viewpoints as the President and his cabinet.  Does anyone really care about them? No, unless you want their scenes cut to shorten your time in the theater. And finally, in a role originated by Alec Baldwin and fleshed out by Harrison Ford, we have Ben Affleck.  Ben is an affable guy.  I usually like him.  But do I really need HIM to tell me how dire a situation a nuclear bomb in downtown Baltimore is?  No, and neither does any member of the audience.   Lastly, the plot.  Well, I'm not going to spoil it for you, but the any sentence in this review is longer than a sentence needed to explain this particular plot.  And as said above, once the bomb goes off, there is no suspense, and no reason to stay in the theater.  A three year old can figure out how this plot is going to unflod having seen only the first five minutes of the film.  My advice?  Stay away. This film is more lethal than Ground Zero!

Partly it's just induction.  Amenábar, to judge from The Others, is a good director; Crowe, to judge from Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous, is a bad one unprincipled, lifeless, addicted to painfully ineffective rock soundtracks, visually inept ... yes, Vanilla Sky could hardly LOOK more enchanting, but this is surely due to cinematographer John Toll (Captain Corelli's Mandolin); the film consists of wonderful images clumsily put together.  Look at the very beginning, in which Toll's marvellous bird's-eye cityscape has been cut to ribbons in a - cough - clever way.Look I'm not complaining.  The story (Amenábar's story) is great.  (I was put off by reports that it's hard to understand.  It isn't.)  Dialogue is smart.  The photography, as I've mentioned, is gorgeous, shot through with fantasy, romance and lovely colours.  It's a good film.  If I didn't know it wasn't original you wouldn't hear me complaining.  But here, for what it's worth, are some reasons for suspecting that the original is betterspoilers follow(1)  Open Your Eyes is CLEARLY a better title - at least for this story.  Vanilla Sky is romantic but beside the point.(2)  Especially given the new title, Crowe cheats.  Vanilla is the colour of the sky in one of David's beloved Monet painting, and it's meant to be a clue that the skies we see after the splice have the very same fairytale loveliness - but we never SEE the painting in question, so we're not in a position to tell.  It's as if Crowe is frightened we'll suspect something and so, instead of using intelligent sleight of hand, simply whisks the evidence by as quickly as he can.  The ideal mystery is both hard to unravel and retrospectively obvious, but if Crowe felt he couldn't satisfy both ideals at once, he should have sacrificed the first, not the second.(3)  Tom Cruise has too many facial expressions.  I'm not saying he's a bad actor.  Under the supervision of a REAL director - look at Eyes Wide Shut or Magnolia for evidence - he would have had no trouble whatever with the part.  But here, he doesn't just smile at Penélope Cruz he smiles, then grimaces, then twitches, then smiles a different way, then frowns, and he hasn't even delivered his line yet.  This schtick sometimes works but here it just eats away at his character.  (Cruz is at once quirkier and more restrained - you can see why HE would fall in love with HER - but then, she's played this part before.)(4)  I've mentioned the appalling soundtrack.(5)  Ditto Crowe's general lifelessness.  The twist at the end is precisely what the film needed (yes, it tells us that it was mostly a dream, but what it really tells us is that it was LESS of a dream than it appeared to be); the complete lack of tension is due to Crowe's inability to handle things now that the obvious creepiness is over.  Too many encounters, too many consecutive meaningful moments, no crispness, no overall viewpoint.  It's as if everyone was bored but unable to call it a day.  Yet the material itself is NOT boring.

The plot concerns a smoggy, burned out future in which people struggle for basics like clean water and food. The food isn't even fresh product, but rather wafer-like crackers in three or so colors. Tucked away above the masses is a faction of society which runs the businesses of the world. These people have plush apartments with all the luxuries possible including built-in lovemates (referred to as furniture!) It is the savage murder of one of these haves which propels the story into action. Heston is a quasi-corrupt cop who has to try and solve the case (while sampling some of the dead man's treats.) The look of the future from the 1973 viewpoint is a tad corny in some ways, but jarring and unsettling in others. Only some of the clothes and technology give the film a dated, even campy, look sometimes. (Heston wears an odd little ascot thingy and a really unattractive hat.) The basic underlying message (that eventually mankind will spoil the planet to the point where it's almost a wasteland) is still relevant, as is the other point outlining the disparity of the classes in America. The scenes of homeless in this film are exaggerated, but in some places it could probably get close to this! Heston gives a solid performance with special merit to be found in his reaction to seeing the way things used to be (birds, blue sky, animals, grass, etc...) Most acting praise is given to Robinson and he deserves it. His final scene in the movie is exquisite.

Peters does a decent job in a limited role. An interesting tidbit is figuring out all the times that Heston's co-stars worked with him before. He worked with Robinson in The Ten Commandments, Conners in The Big Country, Mike Henry in Skyjacked, Peters in Major Dundee, Kilpatrick in The Omega Man, etc...

I am not going to run you through the entire movie, as that has been done several times on here already, but I would like to clear up a few misunderstandings and harsh words that I have read in previous comments.First and foremost, I have not seen or read the play (although I am looking forward to it) and I was perfectly able to understand all of the so-called high-brow concepts like fate, time, freewill, self-awareness, and the light peppering of existential musings (my favorite of which is the ...well at least I'm not dead. speech).  The first time I watched this film I was very fascinated, amused, and slightly confused.  These Pythoneon nonsensical scenes that some of you are reffering to were a bit difficult to understand, but after a second viewing they all made perfect sense.  It does not take a genius to see the multiple layers and metaphors being used in this film.  As for being totally lost without first seeing the play, that is rediculous.  It took a bit of thinking and rewinding, but it is comprehensible, and after you figure it all out for yourself it is very rewarding and adds to the enjoyment, and genius, of the film.  For example, the first time i watched this movie I was very confused by the pages of manuscript randomly floating around after R&G encounter the players for the first time.  But once you realize that the lead player is fully self-aware, has been through these scenarios (the play Hamlet) several times with a full consciousness and memory of the events (demonstrated rather obviously by his full knowledge of future events, the play that his troupe rehearses in front of R&G wich is an exact copy of Hamlet, etc.) it makes for a wonderful metaphor demonstrating what has happened to the original play (Hamlet) now that some of its more flat characters are starting to think outside the script, so to speak, and become a bit more round.Well, I could go on forever about this masterpiece, and maybe I will at a later date, but for now I just wanted you know that this film is anything but simple.  If you can manage to put a little thought into what you are seeing and hearing you will find that it is perhaps the most complex, multi-layered, intuitively rewarding film ever created.P.S.  I am afraid this film is not widely accessible to the majority of movie watchers, which really saddens me because it is truly an amazing work of art.  I would very much like to remedy this.

These Pythoneon nonsensical scenes that some of you are reffering to were a bit difficult to understand, but after a second viewing they all made perfect sense.  It does not take a genius to see the multiple layers and metaphors being used in this film.  As for being totally lost without first seeing the play, that is rediculous.  It took a bit of thinking and rewinding, but it is comprehensible, and after you figure it all out for yourself it is very rewarding and adds to the enjoyment, and genius, of the film.  For example, the first time i watched this movie I was very confused by the pages of manuscript randomly floating around after R&G encounter the players for the first time.  But once you realize that the lead player is fully self-aware, has been through these scenarios (the play Hamlet) several times with a full consciousness and memory of the events (demonstrated rather obviously by his full knowledge of future events, the play that his troupe rehearses in front of R&G wich is an exact copy of Hamlet, etc.) it makes for a wonderful metaphor demonstrating what has happened to the original play (Hamlet) now that some of its more flat characters are starting to think outside the script, so to speak, and become a bit more round.Well, I could go on forever about this masterpiece, and maybe I will at a later date, but for now I just wanted you know that this film is anything but simple.  If you can manage to put a little thought into what you are seeing and hearing you will find that it is perhaps the most complex, multi-layered, intuitively rewarding film ever created.P.S.  I am afraid this film is not widely accessible to the majority of movie watchers, which really saddens me because it is truly an amazing work of art.  I would very much like to remedy this.  So, if you have watched this movie at least 2 times, and are still puzzled by some of the scenes, please feel free to email me and I would be happy to explain anything that might heighten your understanding of the film.

The images of that flick are among the most disturbing ever recorded, but if, like me, you own the Zombie DVD, go no further with Fulci. Stay right where you are.  The two films he did right after -- this is one of them -- are just plain laughable.  Only view it under these circumstances alcohol, friends, riffing.  Watch it alone and face the dreary consequences.  You will begin to make fun of it almost immediately, and desperately wish your friends were there to join in.  The music is especially ridiculous -- it gives a whole new landscape to the word cheese.  It is like lounge rock too foul for even the worst lounge you can imagine.  Look, it is no blasphemy to say that Fulci fell apart after Zombie.  At least his stumbles are entertaining in a weird, Dali-esque sort of way.  He managed one horror classic -- and how many directors can say as much?  Compare him with Carpenter, director of the unequaled Halloween, and you'll see what I mean.  You can bring your friends over for a Fulci flick, and chuckle and giggle, and have a merry ol' time -- but Escape From L.A. and Ghosts of Mars just make one melancholy in a helpless, dog-in-the-rain kind of way, like you're staring at a tombstone of someone you once knew.
