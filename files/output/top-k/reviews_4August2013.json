There are not many things I love more in this world than baseball and movies. Field of Dreams is hands down the best baseball movie ever made. With the great acting from Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones is backed up by the great writing and interesting and mystical story. I first saw this movie when I was very young and The Voice scared me but I manned up and watched it, and I loved it. In case you don't know the story, Ray, a farmer from Iowa, hears a voice that changes his life. This embarks him on an adventure where dreams can come true and the sport of baseball ties in perfectly.Kevin Costner narrates the first scene and he gives am awesome backstory to Shoeless Joe Jackson, himself, his father, and his family. I love that scene for introducing everything we need to know about the movie. I never heard of Joe Jackson or the 1919 Black Sox Scandal so that was cool. The movie starts with the voice saying If you build it, he will come, lines that everybody who has seen or even not seen the movie knows. These lines made this more than a baseball movie introducing mysticism and a higher power into the real world. The voice scared me and in a way it still does, its creepy and I put myself in Ray's position and I don't know what I would have done. My favorite scene is the first scene with Ray and Joe Jackson. Ray follows his gut and the voice by deciding to plow over a chunk of his corn to build a baseball field. He built it, and Shoeless Joe came. The scene itself is subtle as Jackson stands in left field, his actual position when he played, Ray then picks up a bat and hits balls to him. After a few hits Jackson comes in they talk a little and then Jackson takes the bat and he hits. There is no music in this scene, it is the natural sounds of the night and the crack of the bat. It was beautifully shot and the sound captured the imagination of the situation. Ray was pitching to a ghost. Then the writing came in. The way Jackson described the game of baseball was perfect. He says something along the lines of, to me it wasn't a game, it was life. Being a huge fan of baseball I know exactly what he means and he was so right. The voice comes back and brings Costner to Boston to find James Earl Jones. The field took a huge chunk out of their money and Ray was going broke. This added the major conflict in the story. It is a race against time and money so Ray takes a bigger risk and goes to Boston to find Terrance Mann. Terrance Mann is an author from the 60s and this movie ties so many generations together so well. The old days with Jackson, the 60s with Mann and the present day of the film. Mann also has a strong connection with baseball so he ties in perfectly. James Earl Jones brings his loud and strong voice to this character. This is my favorite role he has played as his character has so much depth.Nothing made me happier than seeing old Fenway without the green monster seats. Fenway Park is the best stadium in major league baseball and was the perfect choice for this movie, and that's coming from a Yankee fan. They could have went for Yankee Stadium and possible touched on the history of the stadium and the sport, but no, they chose Fenway and I couldn't have been happier. The mind boggling in this movie is crazy with the twists and turns are hard to believe. There are elements of time travel and what is in the corn field which I am still trying to figure out. Another famous quote, Hey, is this Heaven? No, it's Iowa. The fact that they deny that its heaven is interesting because to the men the field affected it seemed like heaven. I would have called it heaven. Ray's brother-in-law can't see the player so that is an interesting factor that obviously is used to keep the problem relevant but other than that this movie is flawless.Overall, Field of Dreams is one of the best movies ever made. It molded careers in Costner and made James Earl Jones' even greater. The People Will Come, Ray speech was one I could listen to over and over and is another piece of beautiful writing. The description of baseball and the effects it has on people is 100% true. The score to this movie is also fantastic and fits each scene perfectly. Field of Dreams is a baseball story but also so much more so for that it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.

The first thing I think about is absorbing the beautiful scenery surrounding me, whether it's with the various amount of trees, or with the cool and cleansing waterfalls, creeks and bodies of water that I encounter. The second thing I think about is if whether or not I'll come across any friendly forest animals along the way and maybe even feed them any food I couldn't eat. I guess you could say that I'm into the outdoors. One film that has contributed significantly to my love of the outdoors would have to be Walt Disney's 5th full-length animated feature, Bambi (1942), arguably the finest accomplishment of Walt Disney's career which has already seen many impressive achievements. The film begins with the birth of a fawn named Bambi who will one day become the Great Prince of the Forest just like his father and protect the other forest creatures from any trespassers. In the meantime, he figures out how to walk and talk and learn more about the world around him. During his childhood, he forms a close bond with his mother and makes many lifelong friends along the way. Among the friends he makes are an energetic rabbit named Thumper, a friendly skunk named Flower, and a female fawn named Faline, who eventually becomes Bambi's future mate. This film essentially tracks his life from birth to adulthood when he starts to assume his duties as Prince of the Forest. When talking about what makes Bambi a colossal movie going experience, the first thing I would talk about would be the musical score by Frank Churchill and Edward Plumb. I can say without any doubt in my mind that it is one of the best musical scores I have ever heard in any American motion picture I've seen in my entire life. It easily qualifies in my top five favorite film scores of all time I love it that much. Aside from contributing so much to the atmosphere of the forest in this film, the musical score adds a tremendous amount of emotion to the narrative due in large part to the heavenly choir. Whenever I hear that choir, I automatically feel better it's so soothing and healing. Say what you will about the songs not being household names. When the opening song Love is a Song plays during the opening credits, my spirits couldn't be raised any higher. The animation and backgrounds in Bambi are some of the studio's best. Walt Disney and his talented staff of animators took special care and effort into the drawing of the animals for this film. They had to study real-life animals and do the best that they could at capturing the realism of their movements, behavior and personalities. The end results are so superb that even the more unrealistic stuff such as ice skating seems credible in its realism. Much like the film's music, the visuals here are so well drawn out and detailed that you feel like you're in the forest throughout the duration of the picture. Remember the shot where Bambi is looking into a stream during the autumn and leaves are falling into the stream and making growing circles? That was a beautiful shot, and luckily for us, there are more shots like that which have similar beauty to them. Because the passion is so strong and present in both the music and animation, it's hard not to be thankful for the devoted artistry that was put into every scene. Along with the strong visuals and music, another reason I think Bambi holds up very well today is because of the characters. Even though the characters are talking animals, they're all very likable and worth caring for. I love how curious Bambi is about his surroundings. I enjoy how Thumper speaks before he thinks (If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all). I was highly amused by how cynical and optimistic Friend Owl was both at the same time. I was also very touched by the strong bond between Bambi and his mom and the meaningful relationship they shared with each other. By the time the picture's most famous scene comes around (which was known to ruin many childhoods, so I won't delve deeper into it), whatever tears are shed are all warranted because that's how special these characters are even if we're only 45 minutes in. I also love how the writers handled the film's influential message of how much man's presence can affect the wildlife. They made the wise decision of not making it overly preachy on how much turmoil man is causing to these animals. Instead, the writers simply track the lives of these animals and the biggest events that occur in each of their lives in a non-conventional way. By making this narrative choice, we're able to love the characters as much as we do and be more involved in the nonlinear and direct narrative. Most importantly, we're able to obtain the message about respecting the wildlife better because we're enjoying how happy these creature's lives can be as opposed to being given a guilt trip about humanity's past mistakes. With Bambi, Walt Disney proves once again that he's a master at storytelling. He keeps the stories simple, entertaining and straight to the point as great storytellers should. There's no way to avoid the subject matter that the most famous scene of this film tackles. But if it's handled as well as it is here, then it's all the more reason to appreciate films like this even more. Bambi is unpredictable, unforgettable, well-drawn, well written, and well-orchestrated. It also remains the greatest film that Walt Disney had ever produced and remains one of my all-time personal favorites.

Even though the characters are talking animals, they're all very likable and worth caring for. I love how curious Bambi is about his surroundings. I enjoy how Thumper speaks before he thinks (If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all). I was highly amused by how cynical and optimistic Friend Owl was both at the same time. I was also very touched by the strong bond between Bambi and his mom and the meaningful relationship they shared with each other. By the time the picture's most famous scene comes around (which was known to ruin many childhoods, so I won't delve deeper into it), whatever tears are shed are all warranted because that's how special these characters are even if we're only 45 minutes in. I also love how the writers handled the film's influential message of how much man's presence can affect the wildlife. They made the wise decision of not making it overly preachy on how much turmoil man is causing to these animals. Instead, the writers simply track the lives of these animals and the biggest events that occur in each of their lives in a non-conventional way. By making this narrative choice, we're able to love the characters as much as we do and be more involved in the nonlinear and direct narrative. Most importantly, we're able to obtain the message about respecting the wildlife better because we're enjoying how happy these creature's lives can be as opposed to being given a guilt trip about humanity's past mistakes. With Bambi, Walt Disney proves once again that he's a master at storytelling. He keeps the stories simple, entertaining and straight to the point as great storytellers should. There's no way to avoid the subject matter that the most famous scene of this film tackles. But if it's handled as well as it is here, then it's all the more reason to appreciate films like this even more. Bambi is unpredictable, unforgettable, well-drawn, well written, and well-orchestrated. It also remains the greatest film that Walt Disney had ever produced and remains one of my all-time personal favorites.

Many can be out there, and have little truth to what the training or missions are really like. Recently I viewed Men of Honor. Starring Cuba Gooding Jr. and Robert De Niro. Both actors I enjoy watching and think they both have a great deal to offer any character they become. This movie did not disappoint and I felt lived up to the times it portrayed. However, there were a couple of scenes where modern amenities did show up. During the film, it depicted the coming of age for a young man having to deal with segregation of the Deep South, and the constant struggle to provide for a family, to assist his father with the daily chores. A key growing period in the film is when Gooding gets on the bus for the United States Navy, and his father gave him the radio and told him never come back. Leave this world behind. That radio would play a couple key roles later in the film as Gooding faces challenges in life. During this period, there were few jobs African Americans could actually hold in the service, and Gooding became a cook, but never let the barriers stand in his way. In his first meeting with Master Chief Sunday, you saw the admiration not for the man, but for the job, he did regardless of the hazards. Gooding's character in the film showed great inner strength and courage, and never once let the rules in place apply to his wants. A show that can prove no matter what you want in life you can attain, with a positive attitude and drive that is unstoppable. We learned so much about Brashares life growing up and dealing with the pressures of military training, and ultimately the knowing of how to perform when the times arises. The first of this is the saving of his fellow diver from drowning, and the award was given to someone who bailed at a critical time in the operation. The second show of strength is of course proving that with 1 bad leg you can continue service in a hazardous field and eventually as we see at the very beginning and the end of the film. His goal of becoming a U.S. Navy Master Diver is achieved and became the first African American to earn this rank.We know much about main character, since the film is based off his life. The other main character known to us as Sunday is very remote. We do know he drinks, fights and has little regard for rank, as we saw between Sunday and the officer at the all ranks ball earlier in the film. The one thing I know is he has the unique ability to motivate and driver others to perform at their best, as it showed in the courtroom seen, and the article he sent to Brasharees while he was recovering from the injury. Sunday's was quite correct during this time in the service. Many service members drank, fought and other actions that would in today's military have them discharged under less than honorable conditions. Over all I enjoyed the film and comparing this film to the previous ones both of these actors have done puts this film above most. Gooding has a great way of going from character to another, but feel this may have been a challenge in having to understand what the real Brashares must have gone through as a young man. De Niro on the other hand has always been a great actor and enjoyed most of his films. The ability to stretch his skills to work all aspects of the character he must become. Sunday I feel was a tough role to work, and not sure if he was able to know Sunday or if he was even alive before the film was made. Great film and would recommend this film to anyone, and would rate this film an 8 out of 10.

It's great fun, and actually stands up to repeated viewings, in order to catch yet more glorious moments of ineptitude in all their splendour. For those who want to know more about Ed Wood (including his infamous transvestism and angora fetish; he apparently directed at least some of Plan 9 in drag) you probably can't do better than Tim Burton's eponymous film, starring Johnny Depp as Ed and Martin Landau as Legosi.

Jennifer Connelly shows much more talent here than in her awarded performance in Beautiful mind ( by the way it was good performance) . Ellen Burstyn was rightfully nominated for Oscar for her performance as the mother of main hero. Jared Leto isn't bad either and Aronofsky deserves some respect for turning Wayans into a serious actor (at least for one movie).The music by Clint Mansell is a classic by now . Strong , haunting , memorable. As a visual experience Requiem is also attractive . The montage took a lot of work and time to look so impressive . They should nominate Requiem  for best editing.Putting aside the technical strengths and good acting ,  Requiem for a dream fails as a movie for me. The whole thing feels like a MTV drama . It's loud , colorful , sometimes shocking and as deep as average music video shown on that channel.Many people who praise Requiem admits that they have seen the movie only once , because they were to afraid to watch it again . I strongly recommend that you should watch this movie at least 2-3 times . If you watch it only once the shock might fool you that you have seen something deep and thought provoking . If you watch it again you will notice how cold , calculated and mechanical this movie really is . Drugs are bad &#x96; says Aronofsky and that's really the only thing he has got to say . Everything else is just a distraction.The characters are barely written . The relationship between Leto and Burstyn , love between Leto and Connelly , friendship between Leto and Wayans &#x96; it's all incredibly thin and barely touched . Connelly's character is an terrible cliché &#x96; daughter of a rich people , she feels unloved because her parents care only about money , she feels lonely , her parents are far away and left her with a guardian , bla bla bla . If it wasn't for Connelly I wouldn't care about her character at all . She was able to bring some soul into such lame character . The movie also never explains or develops Wayans past ( one flashback with his mother and that's it ? Really ?) same as never gives the viewers a little bit more information on Leto's and Burstyn's family life.Requiem also has got some serious plot problems . Connelly is a daughter of rich people. They give her lot of money , yet when she needs the money the most , in critical situation of the story , they magically disappear not leaving any trace where they can be . The powerful drug dealer that rules the whole town has incredible money and power . Yet , he's not able to find a girl for himself !? That's a chance for Connelly to get some money ?! In real life he would be surrounded by at least few girl's , but not here . Here Aronofsky needs to break Connelly's character emotionally , so he crates two terribly unrealistic situations for a large dramatic effect.I think it's stupid that Leto kept injecting drugs in ONE PLACE OF HIS BODY . Even when his arm is ALL PURPLE AND LOOKING F****** TERRIBLE ?! Seriously , how stupid is that ?! I'm not a junkie , but I wouldn't never do that . I've seen also a documentary about junkies . They inject drugs in different places on the body to prevent danger . They aren't retarded as the movie suggest. And it's no way possible that doctor in hospital would call police first and not take care of the sick arm first . I also love the description of America in this movie. EVERY doctor , cop or prison guard is a cold blooded sadist or uncaring bastard at best . So you see , our heroes are living in such OPPRESIVE country that they HAD TO become junkies .The ending of the movie is basically an marathon of torture for each hero. Aronofsky plays with viewers emotions in a rather primitive way (4 tragedies combined together instead of one). Saw has more subtlety. Funny thing &#x96; on repeated viewings , when the element of surprise is gone , you will find that there's no heart , no real emotion hidden in Requiem.I give it 5\/10 . Maybe the pure shock will keep some people away from drugs . That's a good thing . Except that , Requiem is more of MTV video instead of art . Style over substance . More shock than a message. Movies like Naked lunch  or Fear and loathing in Las Vegas are better movies about drugs.

It's loud , colorful , sometimes shocking and as deep as average music video shown on that channel.Many people who praise Requiem admits that they have seen the movie only once , because they were to afraid to watch it again . I strongly recommend that you should watch this movie at least 2-3 times . If you watch it only once the shock might fool you that you have seen something deep and thought provoking . If you watch it again you will notice how cold , calculated and mechanical this movie really is . Drugs are bad &#x96; says Aronofsky and that's really the only thing he has got to say . Everything else is just a distraction.The characters are barely written . The relationship between Leto and Burstyn , love between Leto and Connelly , friendship between Leto and Wayans &#x96; it's all incredibly thin and barely touched . Connelly's character is an terrible cliché &#x96; daughter of a rich people , she feels unloved because her parents care only about money , she feels lonely , her parents are far away and left her with a guardian , bla bla bla . If it wasn't for Connelly I wouldn't care about her character at all . She was able to bring some soul into such lame character . The movie also never explains or develops Wayans past ( one flashback with his mother and that's it ? Really ?) same as never gives the viewers a little bit more information on Leto's and Burstyn's family life.Requiem also has got some serious plot problems . Connelly is a daughter of rich people. They give her lot of money , yet when she needs the money the most , in critical situation of the story , they magically disappear not leaving any trace where they can be . The powerful drug dealer that rules the whole town has incredible money and power . Yet , he's not able to find a girl for himself !? That's a chance for Connelly to get some money ?! In real life he would be surrounded by at least few girl's , but not here . Here Aronofsky needs to break Connelly's character emotionally , so he crates two terribly unrealistic situations for a large dramatic effect.I think it's stupid that Leto kept injecting drugs in ONE PLACE OF HIS BODY . Even when his arm is ALL PURPLE AND LOOKING F****** TERRIBLE ?! Seriously , how stupid is that ?! I'm not a junkie , but I wouldn't never do that . I've seen also a documentary about junkies . They inject drugs in different places on the body to prevent danger . They aren't retarded as the movie suggest. And it's no way possible that doctor in hospital would call police first and not take care of the sick arm first . I also love the description of America in this movie. EVERY doctor , cop or prison guard is a cold blooded sadist or uncaring bastard at best . So you see , our heroes are living in such OPPRESIVE country that they HAD TO become junkies .The ending of the movie is basically an marathon of torture for each hero. Aronofsky plays with viewers emotions in a rather primitive way (4 tragedies combined together instead of one). Saw has more subtlety. Funny thing &#x96; on repeated viewings , when the element of surprise is gone , you will find that there's no heart , no real emotion hidden in Requiem.I give it 5\/10 . Maybe the pure shock will keep some people away from drugs . That's a good thing . Except that , Requiem is more of MTV video instead of art . Style over substance . More shock than a message. Movies like Naked lunch  or Fear and loathing in Las Vegas are better movies about drugs.

Jennifer Connelly shows much more talent here than in her awarded performance in Beautiful mind ( by the way it was good performance) . Ellen Burstyn was rightfully nominated for Oscar for her performance as the mother of main hero. Jared Leto isn't bad either and Aronofsky deserves some respect for turning Wayans into a serious actor (at least for one movie).The music by Clint Mansell is a classic by now .

Blade, outside of Tombs of Dracula, fought the scientifically created vampire Morbius in Adventure into Fear #24 which was published in October 1974; he then had his first solo story in Vampire Tales #8 which was published in December 1974 and Blade comics are still being published to this day.Now there's one thing I should note before I express my opinions on this movie. I've said before in my other reviews that I've read various Marvel comic books. Now for Blade. To be honest, I've never ever read a Blade comic book in my life nor have I read other titles that he has been in so I'm really sorry if I can't compare this particular movie to the original source material with the exception of the origins of the character but I hope that you'll still find this review very useful in someway.The storyline is when Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire during pregnancy, she did not know that she gave her son Eric Brooks a special gift while dying; He holds all the strengths of a vampire but does not have any of their weaknesses whatsoever and also has a combination of martial art skills. Blade grew up to be a vampire hunter for revenge on his mother's death. The vampires, who managed to infiltrate nearly every major organization, need Blade's very special blood to summon La Magra, the blood god, in order to reign over the human cattle. The plot is very decent and it isn't just another standard superhero origin movie.Wesley Snipes was great in the role of Eric Brooks or Blade as people would like to call this character. His performance is quite good and gritty; he's mean with his fists and snarls impressively quite a lot. I think that they capture the essence of the Blade character from the comic books really well, he's a skilled martial artist, has superhuman strength and is a swordsman in a lot of cases. Deacon Frost played by Stephen Dorff was really good in the role. I can see why they decided to put Deacon Frost in this movie considering that Blade has fought him a lot of times in the comic books and was actually responsible for the death of his mother so I'm glad they decided to stay with the source material in most cases.The atmosphere of the movie is perfect, the scenery is very stylish, dark and corrupting. Blade is not just another faceless hero, we get character development and he is not in the mood to talk about his past and you will find out why. The special effects were good for their time and are still well-crafted in the present. Action sequences were choreographed very well and they were a ton of fun to view. You may not want to view this film with your little kids or little brothers or sisters because this film has quite a lot of jump moments and is gore in a lot of cases. The only changes between this movie and the comic books were some notable changes to the screenplay of this movie from the comic book source material, regardless of that, it felt very true and dignifying to Blade the vampire hunter. The blood and gore was also a welcome addition to the Blade trilogy and I think we didn't actually get that much gore in the comic books due to the fact that comic books are aimed at a teenage audience. If it seems unnecessary, well, just think about this. How else would a warrior fighting against vampires of this malevolence end up looking like? It can't be that easy and polished. If I had to nick pick some stuff from the movie, it's the animation of the blood in some cases. When Blade injects Deacon Frost with the serum, Frost gets blown up and the animation of the blood in that case was not very good. And I wasn't a fan of the actress who portrayed Karen. She didn't act very well and she had annoying glances and frowns that just made me angry a bit.Overall, if you love horror or vampire flicks, then you'll love this movie. Fans of the comic books will also enjoy this comic book adaptation; the only changes were made are the screenplays but that change can easily be ignored.

Good Will Hunting is about a simple janitor named Will working for MIT. However Will is not just another janitor, he is a mathematical genius that solves mathematical equations that have been written on the chalk boards in the classrooms that the other students are unable to solve. When the professor of mathematics sees these solutions done by Will he wants Will to start a job where he is able to use his gift in mathematics. Will however does not want to do this he wants to spend his life as a laborer. Through the course of the movie Will also got arrested for getting in a fight and professor Lambeau (mathematics professor) gets Will released into his custody but only by Will agreeing to see a psychologist. Will ends up going through five psychologists before professor Lambeau is able to find one that Will connects with. Will also starts a relationship with a young lady named Skylar whom he meet in a bar. However when Skylar asks Will to move with her to another state Will threw a temper tantrum and breaks off the relationship, in an attempt to prevent future emotional pain. By the end of the movie after Will breaks down in his final therapy session with Sean. He then decides to go to find Skylar and make that relationship work. By working with Sean the psychologist Will was able to discover who he is and is able to move on from his past and start living the life that will make him happy. By doing this Will is then able to find his place in the world.One motif that was repeated throughout the film that is related to the theme is Will going to see Sean the psychologist over and over aging. While Will is with Sean he is able to slowly discover who he is and where he fits into the world or where his place is with his friends and in his relationship with Skylar. Good will hunting also used internal conflict within Will to portray the theme of this movie. By Will having a bad childhood and allowing this to dictate his life throughout the movie it also showed us how Will's personal conflict made it hard for Will to really discover who he was or where he should be. However in the end Will was able to achieve that personal discovery of himself and move on in the world to a life that would be right for him without all the past conflict.

By doing this Will is then able to find his place in the world.One motif that was repeated throughout the film that is related to the theme is Will going to see Sean the psychologist over and over aging. While Will is with Sean he is able to slowly discover who he is and where he fits into the world or where his place is with his friends and in his relationship with Skylar. Good will hunting also used internal conflict within Will to portray the theme of this movie. By Will having a bad childhood and allowing this to dictate his life throughout the movie it also showed us how Will's personal conflict made it hard for Will to really discover who he was or where he should be.

Good Will Hunting is about a simple janitor named Will working for MIT. However Will is not just another janitor, he is a mathematical genius that solves mathematical equations that have been written on the chalk boards in the classrooms that the other students are unable to solve. When the professor of mathematics sees these solutions done by Will he wants Will to start a job where he is able to use his gift in mathematics. Will however does not want to do this he wants to spend his life as a laborer. Through the course of the movie Will also got arrested for getting in a fight and professor Lambeau (mathematics professor) gets Will released into his custody but only by Will agreeing to see a psychologist. Will ends up going through five psychologists before professor Lambeau is able to find one that Will connects with. Will also starts a relationship with a young lady named Skylar whom he meet in a bar. However when Skylar asks Will to move with her to another state Will threw a temper tantrum and breaks off the relationship, in an attempt to prevent future emotional pain.

Yesterday i did and i think ,like everybody say ,it is one of the best movies made ever. Al Pacino who was not very popular at that time make his breakthrough performance and he is just great in the role of Michael Corleone. About the legend Marlon Brando,he is just phenomenal,his facial expressions and husky voice just make his role one of the best characters. It is based on Mario Puzo's novel about five fictional mafia families and Must say he did a great job on screenplay too. There are some great as well as shocking scenes in this movie i.e. When Woltz wake up and finds a real severed head of a horse. Sonny beats up his brother-in-law Carlo. Prolonged fight between Connie and Carlo. Death of Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone. Death scene of Sonny ambushed by gang members at toll. The killings of all the other heads of Mafia families,Moe Green,Tesiso and Carlo. I loved the setting and style. James Caan,Richard S. Castellano,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton & Talia Shire did great jobs too. Despite the many Anachronisms,this movie is just marvelous. I have read everything that Coppola dis to make this movie so outstanding. Maybe the best gangster movie ever made. Thanks Paramount,Francis Ford Coppola and every Cast-crew member related for producing this chef-d'oeuvre.

Easily in my top 20 all time and maybe top 10. I think it's a Mind Thriller. The ingenious way she gets Angie's phone no. The scene at the BMW dealer where she gets Angie's new address. Later, she obtains Nick's new and latest name and his address through a Kandinsky painting. She recognized the painting from a newspaper article about Angie's accident. It had been hanging in her house. She knew that all Kandinsky paintings were registered and used this to find Nick' New Orleans address.I'm aware of the relatively low rating of this film. I've read most of the reviews and many of them are not so complimentary. Many of these people have rated the movie as a 0 or a 1. This is one reason why the rating is so low. I will now address some of the most common complaints about the movie1. Double Jeopardy doesn't exist. The main plot point of the movie is that you cannot be tried for the same crime twice in America. Many - apparently knowledgeable - people have said that this is not true as a point of law. I'm not a lawyer but I would like to ask a question Has it ever been proved in a court of law? Has anyone ever murdered someone, paid their penalty, got out of jail, found the still alive person, and the killed them? I doubt that this has ever happened. If it does, I venture to say they would find the second murder justifiable.I have always assumed that Double Jeopardy does in fact exist. Even it it really doesn't, then what is the problem? In U.S. culture, it does exist. It is used as plot points in many movies. Why did Charles (Terry Thomas) give a gun to Stanley Ford (Jack Lemmon) in How to Murder Your Wife.2. No credibility. There are many action scenes in the movie. Each one is believable. Taken together, I guess one's credibility must be stretched. But, what is the problem? This is a movie that exists for our entertainment. Is it really so important that - although she was initially handcuffed - she swims to the surface in the bay, hits Tommy Lee Jones over the head with his own gun, and then swims to shore, is hard to believe. I enjoyed the scene. While watching it, I was not thinking that it's not credible. Was Barry Kane (Robert Cummings in Saboteur) more credible when he, while two hands were hand-cuffed together, jumped off a very tall bridge, and somehow swam to shore while police officers were in pursuit?3. Cops out of Double Jeopardy. The complaint was that although she initially wanted to kill Nick, she eventually only wanted her son back and thus reneged on the Double Jeopardy plot point. My response is that she changed her mind after she realized that Simon Rider had killed his wife. She now knew that he was more dangerous that she thought. She reverted to the no. 1 priority which was to get her son back. This is not spelled out in the movie and so it's a little like Hitchcock, isn't it? He loved to make the viewers think for themselves.Speaking, of Hitchcock, I have wondered, what if this movie was exactly the same except he was the Director. Then what would the IMDb rating be? I maintain it would be close to 8.0.4. Too Predictable. Yes, I admit it was predictable. I knew the moment she went to prison that she would get out and eventually be reunited with her son. So what? The ending was one of the most satisfying I've ever seen. I watched High Noon for only five minutes and knew that the Marshal (Gary Cooper) would have a gun-fight at the end of the movie and that he would win. Didn't stop Gary from winning an Oscar at all.5. Lacks Suspense. Suspense is not a concrete thing. I can only answer this complaint by saying that, for me, it was very suspenseful. When she found Angie Rider's new address in Colorado and, before going to the door, preparing the gun - was this not suspenseful? Many situations in the movie were suspenseful. 6. The Annoying Hesitation Before Shooting. When Libby (Ashley Judd) and Travis (Tommy Lee Jones) confronted Jonathan near the end, I agree that it was annoying that Jonathan hesitated before shooting. This allowed Travis to jump on him and eventually, allowed Libby to kill him. I didn't like it either but it didn't bother me. This seems to be the Hollywood way. In summary, Double Jeopardy is great entertainment. It's clever, suspenseful, and has a tear-jerking ending.

George works in a New Carthage university as an associate History professor, and the President there is Martha's father, the relationship has an extra dimension added because of this, but even with their unashamed hatred for each other there is perhaps some dependence for one another. New and ambitious young university Biology professor Nick (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated George Segal) and his mousy wife Honey (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Sandy Dennis) have been invited by Martha for a night of drinking and festivities, and of course as the night goes on the couple are caught between the mind games trying to hurt each other and those around them. The biggest arguments between them comes from the mention of the unseen son they have, who celebrates his sixteenth birthday the following day, they get out of the room a little, but even then the antagonistic behaviour and profanities continue.

The way he looks at her and talks to her, it's amazing. I also love Jodie Foster, she's not some kind of barbie girl and I like that. She has a personality. It's one of the best movies ever. It's honestly legendary. It's the best part of the trilogy, really. The others are kind of wanna bes, of course, Hannibal is amazing but it's not the same.I love all of the actors and actresses. I had a blast watching it, it's so exciting, it scared me but in a good way. The first time you watch it, you never know what is going to happen, that is really awesome.

This film has some stunning visuals, particularly for its time of release. These Visuals still hold up pretty well today in 2013. The strong theme of love and a goal for our main character allows us to follow the film through till the end, but at times lacks little more substance and offers the story-line little more than 15 minutes worth of plot.Whilst in a realm that isn't our reality and with rules thrown out the window, it feels at times, we the audience can gain little more footing as to whats going on as the main character, and feels as though the story is being made up as we go along.What Dreams May Come overall is an OK movie and anyone who's a fan of Robin Williams will be pleased with this one. The production design is fantastic, and all the players fill well what is there for them in the characters, but you cant help but feel lost and a little confused, as this was adapted from a book i cant help feel that there was a lot more in the book left out, or in the book the context works better in print.3\/10 for me, half an hour too long, not one i would recommend ","genre":null},{"date":"4 August 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" What Dreams May Come explores a subject long wondered about, the greatest untold journey.

The major themes, the idea of pure evil corrupting the innocence of a child, struggling with faith and sacrifice etc. Then you might find this movie shocking\/scaryI dunno, I know that when this was released in the early 70's all of the things I listed above were much more controversial topics, and feel that to a certain extent they were kind of floating around in society and in the minds of people attempting to individually grapple with these kind of issues in their own ways. To have all of this stuff thrown at you, would have been at the very least jarring and possibly horrifying, and at the worst personally terrifyingIf you're an atheist, that laughs at the superstitious\/moralistic sensibilities of traditional society being offended, have grown up seeing truly disturbing stuff online and in books etc. Then chances are you're just gonna end up either bored, or laughing.The only thing I found even slightly creepy was the few glimpses of Pazuzu (the white faced devil) that you get when he flashes on the screen for a second or two.Good special effects, fine acting, decent direction, but if you're unable to connect with the subject matter then none of that will matter. It's like somebody making a horror movie about a jar of pickles; If you don't have an irrational phobia regarding pickles you won't find it frightening\/shocking in the least.
