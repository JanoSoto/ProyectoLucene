The score is also excellent.  I wasn't even a jazz fan prior to seeing this movie.  But I liked all the tunes played in this marvelous film.  As a matter of fact, this movie introduced me to jazz music, which has gotten into my liking.I must have seen this movie over and over again within short span of time period, and I can't say that about many movies.  Many people criticize for its ambiguous ending, but must all good movies have happy ending?  No, the real world isn't always happy, and having an ending like this movie's opens discussion among viewers with their interpretation.  Truly a remarkable film.

However the prevalence of any new technology is invariably followed by those who would rely on gimmick alone rather than quality. Such is the case with martial arts master Jet Li's latest offering, The One.The One takes place in the future where inter-dimensional travel has become possible. Each dimension runs parallel to our own and is home to the same people, but under different circumstances, living completely different lives. Voyaging to another universe is for authorized dimensional police only. Li plays a former member of this police force going by the name Lawless. We learn, through clumsily constructed exposition, that he has defected after discovering that every time one of his alternate reality selves dies, the `life energy' from the dead self is distributed among the remaining selves. So Li is on a mission to travel to all of the universes and kill himself in each, becoming increasingly more powerful until he becomes `the one' at which point he imagines he'll be unstoppable.As one might guess, Li also plays our hero, Gabe. Gabe is a cop in a universe that isn't aware that other dimensions exist. He lives a happily oblivious life complete with friends on the force and a beautiful wife, T.K. Lawless travels to this universe followed by two other dimensional law enforcers, Funsch and Roedecker. The two try to stop Lawless from killing Gabe, his last remaining twin, and achieving ultimate power.  Oh, and did we forget to mention that it may also cause all the universes to explode? Maybe. No one in the film seems sure.Immediately, the premise of this film catches the audience's attention. What if there are other worlds out there? Am I as unique as I believe myself to be? What would I be like if one small element of my life were altered? These are all very intriguing questions and writer\/director James Wong took care to ensure that none of them were addressed in this film. Indeed, it appears that all opportunities to include thought-provoking content were patently avoided. The fact that this is an action movie, and a martial arts flick on top of that, suggests that one shouldn't expect in-depth social commentary or even a complex plot, but The One continually disappoints it's viewers by raising interesting concepts and then failing to focus on them.For example, it would have been clever to show Lawless assassinating several different versions of himself, each with a different appearance and lifestyle. This could have easily been done in montage or in a sequence of short combat scenes that would have prepared the audience for the main action of the film. Instead we see only one other version of Li aside from his two main characters and a few humorous images displayed on a computer screen that make it appear as though the director simply gave Li a box of wigs and jackets to play with. Furthermore, the characters are quite weak. We are given brief introductions to each of the main players, but these serve only to remind us of some stereotype or character from another film that we can use as a mental placeholder in lieu of actual character development. After all, this is an action movie; we've got to get to the fighting as quickly as possible. As if that weren't enough of a deterrent, characters are unceremoniously and unnecessarily killed just as we have some semblance of an attachment to them. Both Li's wife, portrayed by the usually brilliant Carla Gugino, and Roedecker, played by the equally talented Delroy Lindo, are executed for no other reason than to motivate Li's good guy character and fuel hatred for his bad guy character, as if the audience could tell the difference.Predictably, the movie culminates in a huge action scene where Li fights himself. It should have been impressive, but was instead boring and much too long. The computer wizardry that allowed Jet Li to kick his own ass was actually so flawless that I forgot to be impressed by it. After Gabe finally defeats Lawless, the film tries to trick us unsuccessfully with the old `which one is which' routine, but I doubt any audience member was fooled. Justice prevails as the evildoer is punished by being transported to a prison universe that looks like the set of a cheap music video. Our hero is rewarded by being sent to yet another alternate reality where he isn't a fugitive for his doppelganger's crimes and his wife is still alive. Gabe doesn't seem to mind that his real wife is dead and he's been presented with a cheap substitute. And how does he or the police know what his wife's history is in this world?  He might fall in love with her all over again, only to discover that her favorite actor has changed from Cary Grant to Adam Sandler. Gabe can pretend his soul mate isn't dead, but he better not come crying to the dimension squad when her stand-in turns out to be a lesbian pyromaniac, decoupage lover, or a carnival freak who has undergone complex surgery to make herself a human lizard.  ...Actually, that would be pretty cool. Why wasn't the movie about that?Overall, The One has few redeeming qualities. The action has been done better in The Matrix and Jackie Chan's canon, the plot is riddled with holes, and the two accomplished character actors, Lindo and Gugino, can't compensate for the fact that Li still hasn't gotten the hang of the English language. If the premise of The One is true and alternate realities do exist, I hope to one day travel to a universe where they never made this film.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"13 November 2002","score":"34 out of 47 people found the following review useful","review":"  Krzysztof Kieslowski's Blue is a film that appears, at first glance, to have a very simple story and almost no plot.  The film is about Julie (Juliette Binoche), who after losing her husband and daughter to a car accident must learn to cope with their deaths.  But the real story revolves around the process of liberation from her past.  Kieslowski illustrates this process with complex visuals, implementing an interesting use of light and shadow, as well as colors, to create an atmosphere that reflects the feeling of this piece perfectly.There is a certain degree of multiple meaning in the use of colors in Kieslowski's Three Colours trilogy, aside from creating an appropriate mood for each part of the trilogy; the colors also represent the blue, white, and red of the French flag.  The three colors stand for liberty (blue), equality (white), and fraternity (red).  Liberty, or freedom from the past, is a major theme in Blue, the first part of the trilogy.  The Juliette Binoche character, Julie, goes through a personal journey, as she must cope with her husband and daughter's deaths.  She must go on with life even though the worst has happened, and she chooses to be free, to become liberated.The color blue is used regularly from beginning to end.  The film starts with a shot of a candy-wrapper moving in the wind; it is colored blue on one side.  The street, the car, and even the air seem to be tinted in a hue of blue.  The last shot before the final montage is of the sparkling blue crystal lamp hanging above Julie's flat.  Throughout the film blue is used extensively, there is a trace of it in practically every shot of the film, everything from people's clothes, the color of ink, the paint on walls and arches, the tint of the street and the water, etc.  The blue is used to create moods of melancholy and coldness, and to draw attention to the resonant emotional associations conjured up by objects and places in Julie's mind. (Andrew, p. 25)  The coloring perfectly reflects the mood of the film; it presents a very dismal and hopeless atmosphere full of solitude and melancholy, giving the viewer a visual insight into Julie's mind.The several scenes in the swimming-pool are some of the most powerful moments in the film, there's aching dimension in the bluish swimming-pool water she regularly immerses herself in (Howe), and it is especially evident in the shot following Julie's recollection of her husband's last words.  In this scene Kieslowski implements an interesting use of light and shadow.  The shot begins in the water, Julie's entire body is submerged, and the only color visible in the frame is blue the water is blue, her body is blue, the surrounding walls are blue, and even the shower door is blue. The camera pans as she moves from one side of the pool to the other.  Then, as Julie lifts herself out of the water, a reddish ray of light covers the upper half of her body, while everything else seems to be hidden behind a blue-tinted shadow; it is as if the essence of life itself is shining its hopeful light on her.  But she can not handle it; she is not yet ready for liberty.  Slowly she lowers her body back into the water, returning once again into the atmosphere of the oppressive blue until she is completely submerged in the pool, her grief now as clear as the bluish water surrounding her.Another fascinating element about Kieslowski's films is the attention that is paid to details, especially when it comes to expressing one of the most difficult elements to capture on camera human emotion.  Every glance, every reaction is rich with meaning, there is no close-up throughout the film that is unnecessary.  Kieslowski works very well with the actors, especially Juliette Binoche, who gives one of the most impressive performances of her career in Blue.  One can see the grief on her face, but it is a very cold grief, more than in any of her other films Binoche gives the impression that her character in Blue is undergoing a complex state of thought.There are a few shots in the film that seem to be unrelated to the story. This is yet another technique often used by Kieslowski to heighten the intellectual capacity of his films.  Whenever creating any series of films, Kieslowski liked to link each respective part of the series with certain characters or actions, and this is true on several levels of the Three Colours trilogy.  Beside the fact that the court scene of White is actually a short part of Blue, and the fact that the characters from all three films appear at the end of Red, there is a very interesting shot of an old woman that is presented in the same way in every part of the trilogy. It's a very simple shot, but it says a lot.  An old woman, so old that she can barely walk, walks slowly towards a recycling container.  She reaches up so high that she can barely reach to throw a bottle into the container, and then once again she takes her bag and slowly walks away.  It is as if Kieslowski wanted to represent life's struggle, and indeed the different struggles of the characters of his trilogy, with this little old woman's struggle with the recycling container.Also seemingly unrelated were several shots of people bungee jumping juxtaposed with a dialogue between Julie and her mother.  Before I was happy.  I loved them.  They loved me, too. says Julie, just as a shot of a man jumping from a helicopter begins.  The fall seems to symbolize her desperation perfectly, yet it is also a symbol for the film's theme of liberation, for although the shots of the bungee jumpers all end just before it, the entire point of the bungee cord is to stop the fall and to pull the jumper back up, perhaps not to the same height, but up again never-the-less. It is like Julie's plunge into the bluish darkness of hopelessness after her tragedy, yet there exists the opportunity for liberation, for her to be pulled back up and to put the past behind her.Music is a large part not only of the story of Blue, but Kieslowski actually worked with composer Zbigniew Preisner to make it a part of the film.  There are more than a few parts in the film where music is essential in creating the effect of the scene.  Kieslowski suggests the music's almost supernatural provenance by showing Julie first dozing in a chair with an unexplained blue light playing over her face, then, having been woken by the music, looking started and mystified toward the camera (which not only draws back from her and then returns, but bathes the scene in a blue wash), as if the music itself were a (blue?) physical presence. (Andrew)  When Julie first starts remembering the tune to the music to the Song For The Unification Of Europe the music plays in several brief flashes, and each time it plays Kieslowski creates a visual lens flare effect, which is of course colored blue.  In the scene where Olivier shows Julie his version of the music the audio and video simultaneously lose clarity each time Julie makes a change to the manuscript, removing instruments from the composition one by one, the camera goes out of focus until only the string instruments are left and the camera is completely unfocused.  The ending sequence is another example, for the first time in the film the audience hears the complete chorus and as the tension builds and we finally hear the choir portion the camera tilts up to Julie's glittering blue crystal lamp, a shot which is followed by the powerful chorus and complete darkness.  This effect of juxtaposing darkness with music is something that occurs several times throughout the film, Kieslowski uses this technique to represent the intensity of emotion running through Julie's head.  When the character Antoine asks Julie if she wants to know what he saw at the time of the accident, she answers simply no, then the screen blacks out and music begins, a few seconds later the black ends and we are returned once again to Julie and Antoine's conversation.It's a shame that more directors do not undertake more ambitious efforts such as the work of Krzysztof Kieslowski.  His films often do not rely on conventional plot elements, in fact, often times there is no real plot at all, yet somehow he was able to make his films both intellectually stimulating and interesting to watch.  In Blue, Juliette Binoche's character, Julia, must learn to cope with her family's death.  She wants to put her past behind her, yet she is drawn into the past because of her husband's unfinished composition.  Does she even want the composition finished?  Was the music originally her husband's, or was she the real composer?  Kieslowski was not interested in answering these questions, he preferred to leave them uncertain.The film is, instead, about the process of Julie's liberation from her memories.  For Kieslowski, subtlety is a religion. He hints or implies -- anything to keep from laying his cards on the table. With Blue, you never feel he's shown his whole hand; not even after the game is over (Hinson). There is no happy ending here, and there is no real solution to the puzzle; the final shot is of Julie's tear-stained face, as it slowly loses opacity to an image of something blue on the frame behind it.  She makes the decision to be liberated from her past; hence it's a hopeful ending, yet the tear represents a struggle that is never really over.

The film is about Julie (Juliette Binoche), who after losing her husband and daughter to a car accident must learn to cope with their deaths.  But the real story revolves around the process of liberation from her past.  Kieslowski illustrates this process with complex visuals, implementing an interesting use of light and shadow, as well as colors, to create an atmosphere that reflects the feeling of this piece perfectly.There is a certain degree of multiple meaning in the use of colors in Kieslowski's Three Colours trilogy, aside from creating an appropriate mood for each part of the trilogy; the colors also represent the blue, white, and red of the French flag.  The three colors stand for liberty (blue), equality (white), and fraternity (red).  Liberty, or freedom from the past, is a major theme in Blue, the first part of the trilogy.  The Juliette Binoche character, Julie, goes through a personal journey, as she must cope with her husband and daughter's deaths.  She must go on with life even though the worst has happened, and she chooses to be free, to become liberated.The color blue is used regularly from beginning to end.  The film starts with a shot of a candy-wrapper moving in the wind; it is colored blue on one side.  The street, the car, and even the air seem to be tinted in a hue of blue.  The last shot before the final montage is of the sparkling blue crystal lamp hanging above Julie's flat.  Throughout the film blue is used extensively, there is a trace of it in practically every shot of the film, everything from people's clothes, the color of ink, the paint on walls and arches, the tint of the street and the water, etc.  The blue is used to create moods of melancholy and coldness, and to draw attention to the resonant emotional associations conjured up by objects and places in Julie's mind. (Andrew, p. 25)  The coloring perfectly reflects the mood of the film; it presents a very dismal and hopeless atmosphere full of solitude and melancholy, giving the viewer a visual insight into Julie's mind.The several scenes in the swimming-pool are some of the most powerful moments in the film, there's aching dimension in the bluish swimming-pool water she regularly immerses herself in (Howe), and it is especially evident in the shot following Julie's recollection of her husband's last words.  In this scene Kieslowski implements an interesting use of light and shadow.  The shot begins in the water, Julie's entire body is submerged, and the only color visible in the frame is blue the water is blue, her body is blue, the surrounding walls are blue, and even the shower door is blue. The camera pans as she moves from one side of the pool to the other.  Then, as Julie lifts herself out of the water, a reddish ray of light covers the upper half of her body, while everything else seems to be hidden behind a blue-tinted shadow; it is as if the essence of life itself is shining its hopeful light on her.  But she can not handle it; she is not yet ready for liberty.  Slowly she lowers her body back into the water, returning once again into the atmosphere of the oppressive blue until she is completely submerged in the pool, her grief now as clear as the bluish water surrounding her.Another fascinating element about Kieslowski's films is the attention that is paid to details, especially when it comes to expressing one of the most difficult elements to capture on camera human emotion.  Every glance, every reaction is rich with meaning, there is no close-up throughout the film that is unnecessary.  Kieslowski works very well with the actors, especially Juliette Binoche, who gives one of the most impressive performances of her career in Blue.  One can see the grief on her face, but it is a very cold grief, more than in any of her other films Binoche gives the impression that her character in Blue is undergoing a complex state of thought.There are a few shots in the film that seem to be unrelated to the story.

Deliverance was a little too long with patching acting, and Zardoz is just pleasantly out there....The King Arthur Legend is covered in full, with wonderful set pieces like the drawing of the sword, the creation of the Round Table, the knighting of Arthur, the meeting of Arthur and Lancelot, and the quest for the Grail. The whole film has a nice moody quality about it, and explores the dark nature of the tale - with the fall-from-grace of Lancelot and England dying as Arthur loses faith and fails the Country.The only criticism I would have is with Nicholas Clay's portrayal of Merlin - I know he is pulling some humour out of the film - but it's a bit too pantomime for my liking, and grates a little whenever he's on screen. It's also a little too ethereal on occasions - but I think that adds to the overall dream-like quality - and it is a Legend, after all...The cinematography is first-class with some very nice images - I liked the shining Castles, the knighting in the moat - shot just above the waterline to give it an intimate feel, and the creepy giggling young Mordred in gold armour just glimpsed through ravaged trees. Acting is good, all the cast give strong performances with real feeling for their characters.A most pleasing film - that took an mature take on a tale normally aimed at a children's market.

Some anime purist may say it is over-rated but they are used to the traditional anime full of non-stop, violent action.  These fans of traditional anime were bored by this film. This is a movie for serious film watchers, not for those who enjoy only anime.  I have only enjoyed maybe a half dozen anime films and this is at the top of the list.  Another thing that people may be critical about is the English dub that is of course no fault to the Japanese filmmakers themselves.  There is a new dub now, yet any true fan of cinema or any person who respects the directors work, will watch a foreign film with subtitles.

This film is only complicated in that it does not spoon-feed, much like other films of the 80s.  However since this is sci-fi you would expect an explanation, there is none given.  I am happy for this because it makes it real, you watch the film as a spectator and you have to deduct what you are seeing.

Should the studio have persisted on rejecting Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and fired Coppolla himself, the greatest film ever would surely never have prevailed.The film boasts a heavyweight cast to which nothing will ever compare. Of course, at the time of production, there were few stars on the set. But since the film's release, each of the principal players have established themselves among the world's acting elite.Mario Puzo's original novel, The Godfather, provided the basis for the movie, though it was skillfully reworked to make a smooth transition to the screen. Both the book and film have more to say than simply tell a story about crime. The complex layers of plot are woven into a exemplary insight into family, honour, revenge and love, when tainted by the deviance of the underworld.Visually, it's a spectacularly-shot film with many a thought-provoking image and beautiful music. But the real quality of the film-making process is the ability to bring out a feeling of pathos from the audience towards the Corleone family.

It's that good. Sure there are some scenes that I would have liked to see, but let's face it... it is veeeeeery long, and there's still two movies to come. (Note what I would have liked to have seen is the part with Tom Bombadill.. that is one of the best parts of the first book.) Oh well. You can't have it all... Which brings me to my second part The acting... Basically it is very good, although I would have wanted to see other actors as Arwen and Galadriel. (And Arwen picking them up after the attack on Weather Top?? No, please no!)The special effects and sound Beautiful! I only wish I had my own movie theatre... Even though I have a surround sound system, it can't do the sound justice, and on my little 21 TV screen, everything becomes too small...And now a bit of ranting against some comments here at IMDB*** Spoiler Alert *** ...First of all This is the first part of the story!!! What would the rest of the movies look like if everything happened in the first one?Second (relates to the first) A lot of people that are trashing this movie seem to not have read the books, so I can see that the way the story is told could seem confusing, but give it a chance. The following parts WILL give you the answers!!! When all of the movies are out, everything WILL fall into place!!!! I cannot stress this enough!!!!Third Yes, I think the fight-scene between Gandalf and Saruman was a bit weird... It feels wrong that two powerful magicians actually use physical means of trying to beat each other. (could have been done astrally, for lack of a better word.) The reason, however, for the fact that none of them die there is that there's a LOT going on that you don't know about.*** SPOILER *** (though to my knowledge not revealed in the books, only in Silmarillion and other background books) Gandalf and Saruman are demi-gods, these are simply their avatars!*** MAJOR SPOILER!!!!! *** Some guy said that when (paraphrasing) a fiery demon appears, then suddenly the old guy can die... Answer to this little riddle Read The Two Towers, or if you're too lazy Watch the movie The Two Towers, when it comes out!!! I PROMISE you You WILL get the answer!!!!!!Another thing that people don't seem to like is the slow pace of the first movie. This is known by everyone who has read the books... (the old 100 pages problem ;-)) This has a reason... It is something called suspense-building. The first movie\/book is INTENTIONALLY slow! You will see why, in the following parts. It's the same reason why Hobbiton is portrayed as this idyllic little place, where everyone's happy. This is to contrast it to all the bad stuff that happens later. The same deal with the over-all slowness of the first movie\/book. Things get a LOT more intense in the second movie\/book. (Helm's Deep anyone...? ;-)) Not to mention the third installment... Someone said that Frodo looked too young... So did Bilbo... Now isn't that odd...? Between Bilbo's leaving and Gandalf returning, 17 years is supposed to have passed (at least in the book), which explains why Frodo looks so young, even though being around 50. Gandalf to Bilbo You haven't aged a day! Think about it.. If you have read the book, you KNOW! If you have seen the movie, and are not a COMPLETE idiot, you should be able to guess...To sum up  You CAN'T base your judgement of the story based on the first movie, seeing as this is actually only ONE THIRD(!!!) of the story! This is an epic tale, and not something thrown together in an afternoon by some Hollywood hack. You're going to see paradise lost and regained, intense battles, terrifying monsters, brave heroes, beautiful women and dark, terrifying places. All topped off by a small hero, who'd rather be back home in his little house.Oh well... peronally (having read the books and knowing what will happen) I can't WAIT for Two Towers, and Return of the King!
