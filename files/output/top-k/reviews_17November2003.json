In the case of Requiem for a Dream, the ending definitely made the film, which as a whole might be an interesting character study for some and possibly great prevention for anyone who thinks about taking drugs. If you like these kind of films I can recommend Bully and Irreversible to you, which I thought were both better than this one. But then again, you could also try Memento, which is even more over-rated on IMDB, than this film. Requiem for gets a Dream 8,5 out of 10 ranking at # 46 and Memento gets a 8,7 ranking at # 14 in the IMDB top 250.

For a second there, I thought he was going back to his most primitive roots and masterpieces like Rosemary's Baby and Repulsion.  Of course, the quality of The Ninth Gate doesn't come close to these titles but it stands as a decent effort in the genre and it certainly is one of the top horror stories of the nineties. I don't even think Polanski is to blame for the fact that The Ninth Gate doesn't reach the same level as his early work. The story and the production values were a lot more mainstream and a much larger audience was intended. Polanski did the best he could with it and his style is clearly present in the movie. A lot of credit should go the perfect cast as well. I don't think it was possible to put together a better cast for this type of movie. Johnny Depp is outstanding as the arrogant loner who tries to clarify the secrets behind 3 copies of the diabolical book The Nine Gates. He plays his character like it was intended to be played...vicious, brutal and mysterious. Frank Langella is excellent for the role he plays here. He's the rich collector who sends out Depp to investigate the background of the books he lives his life by. I can't give enough praise to Lena Olin neither...she's one of the most sensual, mysterious and macabre actresses alive and no other woman could have played her role better. Her character is much like the one she did in 'Romeo Is Bleeding' ...an irresistible - yet very dangerous - stylish woman who you can't help but to worship. And of course Polanski couldn't resist to cast his very own wife ( at that time at least ) Emmanuele Seigner in a raw but very erotic role. Well, I don't have a problem with that...She sure can act and the look in her eyes keeps you close to the screen constantly. She's at least as attractive here as in that previous Polanski movie Bitter Moon ...expect for the fact that she was the only good element in that movie. There's a lot more to enjoy about the Ninth Gate. Especially the first half of the movie is a success. The terrific opening scene and credits ( through nine gates ) immediately set the right mood and atmosphere. The first 45 minutes of this movie are a macabre and fascinating excursion into the more dark side of religion. This part of the Ninth Gate really keeps you focused and very close to the screen. Too bad this level of quality isn't held up the entire movie. Too many twists and illogical sequences weaken the movie and the finale is - as usual in this kind of movies - way over the top. A real shame but not a complete disaster...By the time the movie starts to lose his grip and power, you already gave it a high rating in your mind.

There is also a creepy sub-plot dealing with the subject of addiction, more than a decade before there was an internet - or internet pornography - and the only form of electronic addiction in our vocabulary was tennis elbow from playing Pac-Man.Christopher Walken and Natalie Wood do a decent enough job, but the standout performance in this film is by Louise Fletcher, one of the finest and most under-utilized actresses of our time.  She plays a crotchety, chain-smoking scientist with a bad heart, a character you can't help liking in spite of her behavior.  She plays one of the finest death scenes ever put on film, and she does it alone - there are no farewells to loved ones here, no heroic blaze of glory - just agony and her final, fateful decision that sets up the rest of the film.  As one who screamed Yeah!!! when Jack Nicholson's hands were around Nurse Ratched's throat in the climax of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the fact that she could bring me to tears in her death scene in Brainstorm is testament to her gifts as an actress.  Suffice it to say, Fletcher's work in this film is what made it memorable to me, and not just another 80s sci-fi trip.There are a couple of glaring implausibilities that bug me - assuming you already buy the premise that the sensory experience _can_ be recorded in the first place.  The gaudy chrome ribbon of tape that they use as a recording medium is exotic enough to be believable, but there's never enough of it on the spool to record much of anything - experiences lasting many minutes are recorded, but clearly the spool would empty out in about 10 seconds.  And the idea that this much information - 3-dimensional visual imagery, sound, feelings, touch, could be transmitted over a portable terminal with an acoustic modem (in a public telephone booth!) is really, really a bit out there.  Anyone who remembers using those devices knows they'd have trouble just transmitting the text of this review accurately, and at speeds you wouldn't need Evelyn Wood to keep up with.  In fact I'd balk at the same thing today with T3 internet bandwidth.

She plays one of the finest death scenes ever put on film, and she does it alone - there are no farewells to loved ones here, no heroic blaze of glory - just agony and her final, fateful decision that sets up the rest of the film.  As one who screamed Yeah!!! when Jack Nicholson's hands were around Nurse Ratched's throat in the climax of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the fact that she could bring me to tears in her death scene in Brainstorm is testament to her gifts as an actress.  Suffice it to say, Fletcher's work in this film is what made it memorable to me, and not just another 80s sci-fi trip.There are a couple of glaring implausibilities that bug me - assuming you already buy the premise that the sensory experience _can_ be recorded in the first place.  The gaudy chrome ribbon of tape that they use as a recording medium is exotic enough to be believable, but there's never enough of it on the spool to record much of anything - experiences lasting many minutes are recorded, but clearly the spool would empty out in about 10 seconds.  And the idea that this much information - 3-dimensional visual imagery, sound, feelings, touch, could be transmitted over a portable terminal with an acoustic modem (in a public telephone booth!) is really, really a bit out there.  Anyone who remembers using those devices knows they'd have trouble just transmitting the text of this review accurately, and at speeds you wouldn't need Evelyn Wood to keep up with.  In fact I'd balk at the same thing today with T3 internet bandwidth.  But I accept the limitations of the film's budget for futuristic props and can forgive it's producers for using computer stuff that was already old at the time.Movie overall 7 out of 10, Fletcher gets a 12 for one of the top 5 death scenes of all time.

Almost six weeks, Vinny says.Vinny's brought his fiancée, Mona Lisa Vito (Tommie), to Wahzoo with him.

But he gets better as time goes on, with the help of his smart fiancée and with the cheering of his cousin. Vinny proves he's a pretty good lawyer by the time everything's over.I didn't enjoy My Cousin Vinny as much as I should have. Taking everything into account, it is a very good comedy. It's built with a strong foundation of a witty script; funny characters and clever dialogue, not to mention an overall joyful feel to it. Nevertheless, I wasn't as enthralled on my first viewing of the film as I had hoped I would be. My second viewing, last night, was better.Joe Pesci is perfect as Vinny, a lovable clown who prides himself in the fact that he thinks he knows everything, but most of the time his pride backfires when he finds out he's not quite as clever as he thinks. Marisa Tomei (who won an Oscar for her supporting role) is hilarious as the straight guy (or gal) of the story. Fred Gwynne is great; this was his final appearance on film, as he died soon after filming wrapped.The movie has some very funny cultural comparisons, the most evident one the argument over the meaning of the word youths, which Vinny pronounces yutes. There's also a good scene when Vinny and Mona Lisa first arrive in Wahzoo and step out of their car clad in leather and jewelry and general city clothing. You stick out like a sore thumb around here, he says. At least I've got cowboy boots. Lisa looks at him and says, Oh, yeah, you blend.Another fine aspect of this film is how strong the courtroom scenes are. Instead of serving simply as a premise for the film to induce chuckles, it has some very interesting and thoughtful scenes, probably enough to go around for ten courtroom movies.

It doesn't sound like much when you say it like that, but trust me, Meet Joe Black is an outstanding film and is without doubt one of the most underrated little gems I have ever seen. The film is beautiful in every regards; the photography, the sets, the music and the performances, especially the performances. The last time Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt were on screen together it was the equally sublime Legends of the Fall, here it is another sublime film and once again they are putting in some of their best work. The characters that they play, Bill Parrish and Death, bring out a fantastic chemistry between the two performers, especially in the more comedic moments when they two are getting to know each other. However, while death is the main theme of the film, director Martin Brest remembers to filter optimism into his wonderful tale in the shape of a love story between Parrish's daughter (played by the beautiful Claire Forlani) and Death himself. This results in one of the most gorgeous coupling in recent years as well as one of the most erotically intense love scenes I have ever watched.Director Brest presents the film in a more artistically filtered view than most other directors might have done. The love scene is done without nudity with close ups on the actors throughout. The striking presentation of the lighting in the film is also fantastic, with a lovely golden glow pouring of the screen and lastly Thomas Newman's music is quite simply marvelous. Films like The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption and American Beauty which have featured music by this outstanding composer have been enhanced by the haunting, lyrical and moving melodies he has composed and this film is no exception. The mixture of piano and orchestra builds to an uplifting and emotional pull that cements his position as one of the best music composers working in modern film today.The three hour running time would appears to be problematic, but alas it is not. In fact like another sweeping romantic epic, Titanic, you will not feel the time going in. The three hours fly by and not only that, like the Oscar winning epic, this is a film that makes one instantly want to re-watch it again and again. Meet Joe Black is a wonderful mixture of comedy, romance and drama and is done exceedingly well.

It doesn't sound like much when you say it like that, but trust me, Meet Joe Black is an outstanding film and is without doubt one of the most underrated little gems I have ever seen. The film is beautiful in every regards; the photography, the sets, the music and the performances, especially the performances. The last time Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt were on screen together it was the equally sublime Legends of the Fall, here it is another sublime film and once again they are putting in some of their best work. The characters that they play, Bill Parrish and Death, bring out a fantastic chemistry between the two performers, especially in the more comedic moments when they two are getting to know each other. However, while death is the main theme of the film, director Martin Brest remembers to filter optimism into his wonderful tale in the shape of a love story between Parrish's daughter (played by the beautiful Claire Forlani) and Death himself. This results in one of the most gorgeous coupling in recent years as well as one of the most erotically intense love scenes I have ever watched.Director Brest presents the film in a more artistically filtered view than most other directors might have done. The love scene is done without nudity with close ups on the actors throughout. The striking presentation of the lighting in the film is also fantastic, with a lovely golden glow pouring of the screen and lastly Thomas Newman's music is quite simply marvelous. Films like The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption and American Beauty which have featured music by this outstanding composer have been enhanced by the haunting, lyrical and moving melodies he has composed and this film is no exception. The mixture of piano and orchestra builds to an uplifting and emotional pull that cements his position as one of the best music composers working in modern film today.The three hour running time would appears to be problematic, but alas it is not. In fact like another sweeping romantic epic, Titanic, you will not feel the time going in.

It was the first Bond film I watched on the big screen and I love it, is is enjoyable, has many a great action sequence and Pierce Brosnan, in his second role as 007, shows a confidence in getting into the role. Like all of his Bond films (GoldenEye, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day), the writers here develop a more character development trait within the film's plot. Here we have the wife of the villain, Paris Carver, played by Teri Hatcher, be revealed to have been one of Bond's former girlfriends, a relationship that was quite intense. We gain an emotional insight into the character as wee see how much he loves her by offering to protect her, but alas she is killed by her husband, Elliot Carver (played with wonderful relish by Jonathan Pryce), and we get an unusual emotional moment, something more akin to Bond's that are lesser considered in the public consciousness like Lazenby and Dalton. Here Brosnan can juggle many of the elements that we associate with Bond with a fantastic dash of style. We have ruthlessness, humor, humanity and an ice sense of cool that he really jumps upon. He is undeniably the heir to the throne of the best Bond on screen, and with him successfully continuing to play the character in two further films that were even stronger, he is, in my opinion, the best Bond there has ever been.Tomorrow Never Dies is not the best Bond film that Brosnan has done (that honor belongs to The World Is Not Enough), but like other 'second' Bond films like From Russia With Love and The Man With The Golden Gun, it is a hugely enjoyable action thriller mixing a fun, if somewhat far fetched plot, with a great wealth of fun and entertainment, as well as some of the silliest, but funniest, puns to grace the screen. Making this tasty cake even more so is Jonathan Pryce's villain, Elliot Carver. Pryce, one of the best actors to come from Britain, is one of those maniacally over the top villains that ends up becoming so much fun you end up liking him. Michelle Yeoh is a great Bond girl, setting in stone the foundations for later films that the Bond girl has to be equal to Bond himself. Her performance is charming and her chemistry with Brosnan great fun to watch. Teri Hatcher is good, I suppose, but then again her much hyped appearance in the film amounts to little more than a glorified cameo appearance that, while memorable, doesn't ensure her to be the Bond girl that she could have been.Featuring a fantastic music score from David Arnold (on a par with John Barry's work) and the most far fetched, but undeniably entertaining, car chase in recent years, this is undoubtedly one of the most fun Bond films that you will get a chance to enjoy.

If you find it on television, it will be buried away at a graveyard slot and this is a shame as Carlito's Way is without doubt one of the finest crime films to grace the screen is undoubtedly the best collaboration between Al Pacino and Brian De Palma. I really like Scarface, it is a hugely enjoyable film, but if Scarface is more similar to a a bottle of beer, then Carlito's Way is more like a bottle of fine wine. It has a more graceful taste that less excessive taste goes down more easily. There is none of the excessiveness that punctuated Scarface. The production design is not as over the top, the violence is toned down a notch and the performance from Al Pacino is more restrained, bringing to mind his finest performances from the 1970's such as The Godfather Part I and II, Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico. Here he delivers a performance that undoubtedly deserved Oscar consideration, while De Palma proves there is more to him than just a stylish sensibility. Yes, there are many of his trademark directorial touches such as the prolonged suspense, the main action sequence taking place in a train station and frequent long takes where the camera continually moves and never stops. Truth is the story here is what makes this film so compelling, despite the foundations that it rests on being cliches from every other crime film that you will have ever seen.The character of Carlito is released from prison and is determined to go straight. We all know that this will never happen. He wants to set up a new life in the Bahamas operating a car rental agency. This will never  happen. He wants to start this new life with the woman he loves. This too, we know, will never happen. What makes this film so brilliant is that De Palma decides not to treat the audience like idiots. The first image of the film is of Carlito being gunned down, lying on death's door in a train station. Immediately we know that this character is never going to escape and despite this De Palma still manages to squeeze every inch of suspense in the final moments. This makes the film one of the most moving that I have ever seen. We really grow to like this character to the point that we hope that he doesn't die in the final reel, but alas this is no fairy tale and no matter how hard he tries and how much we want him to, Carlito is doomed.Al Pacino's performance here is, and I cannot stress this enough, fantastic. He never shouts, never goes into blistering shouting mode, he delivers a performance of amazing restraint that one quickly realizes why he is always at the top of lists that deem him to be the finest actor working today. The supporting cast here also put in some great work. Sean Penn quite possibly puts in a career best performance as Carlito's lawyer, the character who is the real villain of the piece, while Penelope Anne Miller is luminous as Gail, the love of Carlito's life.  The chemistry between both Miller and Pacino is superb and one really gains a sense of why they are willing to run away from it all at the end of the film.Behind the camera De Palma proves what a versatile and fantastic filmmaker he is. Forever doomed to be known as a director of Hitchcock tributes, he shows us what he is really like behind the camera, proving to his detractors that he can make material on his own merit. Unlike previous films he has made, you will be hard pressed to find homages to Hitchcock and Eisenstein films here. This is undoubtedly his finest picture and one that should have earned him a nomination for best director at the 1993 Academy Awards. Likewise Pacino and Miller. Amazingly Penn did get a much deserved award for his performance, amazing because for once the Academy did something right.On top of all this we have a fantastic music score from Patrick Doyle and one of the most moving death scenes in recent memory, if you have yet to see Carlito's Way, please do.

Hands down, this film raised the bar and set the standard for what a real movie should be.Orson Welles, who starred in, directed, produced, and co-wrote this film, gave the movie industry a fresh new outlook on how movies should be made and presented.  Having already gained notoriety in radio, Welles took on the challenge of filmmaking when he was only 25 years old.  No one knew nor expected anything remarkable to come from Welles' work, but the cinematic genius produced a film worthy of being praised as the greatest film ever made.What sets this film apart from all of the other's made in that era up until now was the brilliant use of the camera.  Welles used many different angles and inventive lighting techniques in his shots to show the emotion within that scene, or the relationship between the characters of the movie. Aside from all of the technical aspects, Welles also had a lot of metaphoric and symbolic elements hidden in his film, however one cannot count or see all of the symbols and metaphors since these elements may be interpreted in different ways.  But in doing so, Welles broadened the views of his viewers, by making them think about every aspect of his film as opposed to just watching it.Citizen Kane depicts a man in a classic rags to riches story.  That man is Charles Foster Kane.  This film shows Kane's strategic climb up New York's social ladder and how he got to become a world-renowned newspaper tycoon. Kane's strong will and independence kept him on top.  But as the plot gets thicker, the audience sees that his `do it myself' attitude ultimately leads to his demise.  Kane was a man that had everything he ever wanted, except of course, happiness.  Something was missing, and as the movie got closer to the end, you could really see the emptiness in Kane's life.  He longed for something or someone called rosebud.  William Alland, who plays Jerry Thompson, the `News on the March' reporter trying to uncover Kane's life, best explains this idea.  In the movie, he says, `Mr. Kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it. Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost. Anyway, I don't think it would have explained everything. I don't think any word can explain a man's life. No, I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle...a missing piece.'Ironically enough, the movie starts off with the end.  After grazing through Kane's estate, Xanadu, the viewer sees Kane on his deathbed saying his famous last word, `Rosebud', which by the actual end of the movie, the true meaning of rosebud is revealed to the audience without the actors in the film realizing it.With so much symbolism and artistry put into every scene, it is no wonder why Citizen Kane is considered as the greatest movie ever made.

Considering that it's been 11-12 years since it was released, it's remarkable that it above all stands out to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. I received the soundtrack as a gift for my 15th birthday and I had a much loved tape that I'd recorded off the TV that I wore down with watching it, and I am now the proud owner of the DVD (not the director's cut, I might add). To say the least, The Last of the Mohicans is my favorite movie and with  good reason.So what can I say about it? Plenty. The movie is beautifully constructed. Gorgeous scenery, colorful and vibrant characters, a well-written storyline and plot, beautiful and very fitting musical score all come together to create this remarkable film and make me fall in love with it every time I sit down to watch it. I think my friends are a little amazed at my continuing admiration for the film, but they can, at least, understand my point of view and agree that it's very well done.Daniel Day-Lewis is a fantastic actor and played the part of Hawkeye fantastically and was for the longest time an ideal historical hero for me; Madeleine Stowe gave credibility to the heroine with her brilliant acting skills and carried her character through from a well-bred lady to a strong and independant woman not afraid to defend herself; Chingachgook, Uncas and Magua was played out wonderfully - and even Major Heyward who we all detest until he redeems himself - were all also wonderful characters. Interaction between them was fantastic, and the climax of the waterfall scene was by far my favorite, with a stunning performance from the actors portraying Uncas and Alice. Again, there's that wonderful music, cinematography and scenery. I attempted, on numerous occasions, to sit down and read the book, but I found it long-winded, boring, and extremely difficult to believe that it could have been the basis for such a wonderful movie. I always tell people that the book is usually better than the movie, but in this case, those words ring hollow as this film has proved to break that mold very nicely.But that's only understandable because I can find no other film that hits the mark when it comes to overall brilliance. Kudos to all involved with the creation of this film. With today's flashy and computer generated films with thumping soundtracks dancing across the big screen, I still call this film my favorite of all time.

I absolutely love it and it is an absolute joy to watch. Especially if you're a Bill Paxton fan, like I am. This is his movie. He steals every scene he's in. He's not really the kind of actor who plays really sadistic characters but he perfected Severen! I really enjoyed the storyline. Good ol' country boy meets a girl from out of town named Mae and he is smitten with her. But unbeknownst to him, she's a vampire. And she's out for blood. And she nips him on the neck. Well, a while later he's picked up by an RV with all the windows covered in aluminum foil. It's Mae and her family. He becomes hungry for blood but he doesn't have the heart to kill. So he drinks from Mae and almost kills her. I think that's interesting. And I loved the fact that these vampires don't have fangs and they don't even use the word vampire in this movie! That bar scene is the greatest scene in the whole movie. I absolutely love it! Severen (Paxton) totally stole that scene. He had all the greatest lines and you could just tell that he enjoyed killing. But I think Jesse (Lance Henrikson) was very creepy as the head vampire but he was also great. Loved the part where he coughed up the bullet after Caleb's father shot him. Diamondback (Jenette Goldstein) was fun to watch as a total badass woman who enjoyed killing as well. But Homer (Joshua Miller) got on my nerves so bad! He was irritating! We could've done without his character. But the movie still rocked. I thought the ending was a little bit cheesy, but it didn't keep me from enjoying this awesome movie. I am so glad I own it on VHS! This is definitely one of Bill Paxton's greatest performances. He acted like being a vampire was the most fun he'd ever had. I loved it! Near Dark is definitely a classic and it is not to be missed by fans of this genre! Thanks for reading my review.

If the people who believe this are talking about the spectacular views and innovative camera angles, then yes, I agree, but otherwise, I could have done without seeing this movie. The simple plot line consists of a man on his deathbed, his final word, Rosebud. This man, Charles Foster Kane was a huge newspaper tycoon, who everyone either loved or hated.  As a memorial to him, a mini-motion picture is made depicting his life, but it is missing something.  The creators decide to throw in his final word, telling the audience what it meant.  Only problem is, as they talk to everyone who was ever close to Kane, his manager, Mr. Bernstien (Everett Sloane), his friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), and his second wife Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), no one can help, no one knows what or who Rosebud is. Eventually the audience finds out, but the characters in the movie never do. Like I said, this is an excellent movie if you are talking about how Orson Welles filmed it.  He used new ways of getting a shot, like in the beginning of the movie where the audience sees the nurse come in to Kane's bedroom threw the shards of broken glass on the floor.  Or when light in Kane's bedroom is on, and then when he dies it fades out.  A really good technique Welles uses while filming was zooming in and out.  A great example of this is at the beginning of the movie when the camera is on the NO TRESPASSING sign on the front gate of Xanadu, after you see that shot, Orson zooms into everything on the grounds, then finally up to Kane's bedroom. Kudos to Orson Welles.  Not only did he star in `Citizen Kane,' but he also produced, directed, and helped write the screenplay.  Unfortunately, that's where all the compliments stop and the criticism begins.  Like the acting, everyone, for the most part, played his or her roles very casually.  It didn't seem like there was too much emotion going on in any one role.  When emotion did surface, it felt overdone and over exaggerated, like when Mrs. Susan Alexander Kane is yelling at her husband, her voice is too shrill for my ears and made me want to stop listening. If you were looking for a movie that has a lot of emotional value, `Citizen Kane,' would not be it.  However, if you were looking for a movie that is ahead of its time visually, you would be pleased as to what you would find in `Citizen Kane.'  All in all I would give this movie 6 out of 10 stars based only on Orson Welles excellent camera techniques.

All in all I would give this movie 6 out of 10 stars based only on Orson Welles excellent camera techniques.

If the people who believe this are talking about the spectacular views and innovative camera angles, then yes, I agree, but otherwise, I could have done without seeing this movie. The simple plot line consists of a man on his deathbed, his final word, Rosebud. This man, Charles Foster Kane was a huge newspaper tycoon, who everyone either loved or hated.  As a memorial to him, a mini-motion picture is made depicting his life, but it is missing something.  The creators decide to throw in his final word, telling the audience what it meant.  Only problem is, as they talk to everyone who was ever close to Kane, his manager, Mr. Bernstien (Everett Sloane), his friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), and his second wife Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), no one can help, no one knows what or who Rosebud is. Eventually the audience finds out, but the characters in the movie never do. Like I said, this is an excellent movie if you are talking about how Orson Welles filmed it.  He used new ways of getting a shot, like in the beginning of the movie where the audience sees the nurse come in to Kane's bedroom threw the shards of broken glass on the floor.  Or when light in Kane's bedroom is on, and then when he dies it fades out.  A really good technique Welles uses while filming was zooming in and out.  A great example of this is at the beginning of the movie when the camera is on the NO TRESPASSING sign on the front gate of Xanadu, after you see that shot, Orson zooms into everything on the grounds, then finally up to Kane's bedroom. Kudos to Orson Welles.  Not only did he star in `Citizen Kane,' but he also produced, directed, and helped write the screenplay.  Unfortunately, that's where all the compliments stop and the criticism begins.  Like the acting, everyone, for the most part, played his or her roles very casually.  It didn't seem like there was too much emotion going on in any one role.  When emotion did surface, it felt overdone and over exaggerated, like when Mrs. Susan Alexander Kane is yelling at her husband, her voice is too shrill for my ears and made me want to stop listening. If you were looking for a movie that has a lot of emotional value, `Citizen Kane,' would not be it.  However, if you were looking for a movie that is ahead of its time visually, you would be pleased as to what you would find in `Citizen Kane.'  All in all I would give this movie 6 out of 10 stars based only on Orson Welles excellent camera techniques. ","genre":"Drama, Mystery"}]
