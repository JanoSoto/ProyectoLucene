Its energy unmistakable; its inspiration unequalled and its charm unmatched, in what is a milestone in animation for reasons much more than the fact the computer generated imagery was as fresh as it was. Vaugely, the memory of seeing it for the first time many years ago stands in rather stark comparison to whatever I recall of the rest of that viewing when it was revealed Toy Story was to be, quite literally, about the toys and their coming to life so as to interact and engage with their surroundings. In starting in the manner it does, with a young boy named Andy animating his toys to as to bring them to life and interact with what's around them as it ran on whatever meek story he could come up with and not knowing a thing about the premise or indeed content, ignorantly, I led myself into believing the entire piece would be of this ilk; quite literally, a toy story about toys being what they are inanimate objects being interacted with by a child. Imagine the sense of surprise mixed with awe and glee when Woody sits up in Andy's room and announces that the coast is clear! to the rest of the toys.The film starts like one of those short cartoons you'd see before the beginning of a feature film, years ago. The opening is a diverting mini-narrative involving each of the main characters going through whatever motions a child can muster; the lead toy of whom is Woody (Hanks), a cowboy doll which is promptly taken downstairs and around the house as it's emphasised he is Andy's favourite, and has been for a while. I suppose what happens when they come alive might be read into as a deconstruction of these toys; that they are, indeed, so much more than just inanimate objects whom don't think nor feel, each of them coming alive once the humans have vacated then operating within said space; maintaining relationships and feeling an array of emotions such as fear, angst and lust. Some are friendlier than others; some more confident and some have certain elevated relationships with each other. Amongst them, Don Rickles' Potato Head doll; a wonderful creation of physical comedy whose detachable body parts are the source of persistently funny jokes. He's joined by a Slinky Dog (Varney); a green plastic dinosaur Rex (Shawn) and, curiously, Andy's piggy bank Hamm (Ratzenberger).Interestingly, Andy's toys seem infused by true-to-life western iconographic imagery, or are indeed representative of 'type' in their attitudes. Rex is a dinosaur, thus feels the need to be able to scare people with his 'roar' for reasons that must be linked to the fact T-Rex dinosaurs from billions of years ago did exactly this. Somehow, Rex is aware of this. Likewise Andy's small toy soldiers, led by a sergeant voiced by R. Lee Ermey, are as militarian as you'd expect but is there a written rule that says they must show expertise in special ops and must behave in the military manner they do? Remember those grey plastic soldiers of similar size you could get? I guess they'd be equally militarily efficient but could speak in a German accent. I had some yellow soldiers of similar size once; God only knows how they'd sound. There can be no surprise that the toys of Syd (von Detten) cannot speak, due to their forced hybridising with other toys under said child's tortuous regime which sees heads and bodies swapped with other toys thus falsifying their image.It can be no coincidence the two principal toy characters of the film are the two that most resemble human beings in their appearance, with Andy's other toys marginalised due to their animistic or unnatural characteristics. Woody's perfect existence is thrown into disarray by Buzz Lightyear (Allen), a spaceman toy Andy gets on his birthday; the revealing of the gift at the end of the present opening session starting this huge build up as to what Buzz is. Buzz's presence is an example of an item of a more futuristic; more science-fiction orientated nature coming into the house and taking over as older items are rendered more obsolete and therefore replaced thus rendering the issue one of a modernity driven nature, and is an item Toy Story 2 explored much more broadly in terms of genre replacing genre when toys of Woody's ilk are rendered nothing but mere museum pieces. But it is additionally representative of America's obsession with consumerism, in that I've no doubt Buzz is a part of a kind of franchise and Andy's gradual replacing of Woody posters\/merchandise etc. This, as he and his mother occupy this blissfully suburban infused street which is systematic of the nation's own attitudes towards mass produced products.Woody and Buzz's overall ultimatum is issued to us, out loud, by Woody when they are stranded at a petrol station Andy's due to move house shortly and both need to get home, so a lot is at stake and tension runs persistently high. Buzz's own tale of realisation is effortlessly inter-cut with this plight, along the way learning of a new existence and garnering a new lease of life as their relationship feeds off a rather Hollywoodised 'buddy' combination no doubt inspired by American films of the 1980s through to the early 1990s of this ilk. Apart from pioneering your now token 'chase' finale, of which encompasses all the elements and is seen nearer the end of mostly every CG animated film made since (see 2002's Monsters Inc. or 2009's Up), Toy Story is a wonderfully made, supremely nourishing film that opens our eyes to a whole new world within our own and enthrals and entertains in equal measure.

What irked me at the start was that they chose to kill people off in an earthquake and not with the Cholera. The earthquake seemed pretty cheesy to me then. (The tornado scene in The Wizard of Oz was more realistic.) The reason given by the director and screenwriter was that no one these days knows what Cholera is. Ironically, the week after the movie premiered, there was an earthquake in India and people were worried about Cholera breaking out. As a child reading this book cover to cover so many times that I wore out a copy, the fear of a fever and infectious disease that could get anyone was much scarier than the threat of an earthquake. The child playing Mary wasn't sour at all. She was cranky, and shrill. I never felt sorry for her. Dickon was an afterthought. He is what Mary wants to emulate. She even picks up on his Cockney speech (well, his and Ben Wetherstaff). They completely neglect the Martha\/Mary\/Mrs. Sowerby story. Here is a woman with more mouths than she can feed herself, and she takes Mary, the sour little yellow orphan into her heart and prayers. It is she who gets Archibald to the Manor upon her pleas that this motherless child need love and warmth. There was so much time spent on the cinematography, that true, joyous parts of this book were lost. When Mary calls Colin (That's COLIN, not KOLIN or COLLIN) a Rajah, he asks her to tell her what one is. That isn't in the book, but he behaves like a spoilt prince as they go outside. That's not the message in the book. In the book, he is a little more awkward and foolish about it. This Mary seems more annoyed at her cousin and his hump than defiant. Mary's defiance and determination in the book are what give Colin is gumption to get better. There is none of that in the book. It is a story of two spoiled only children who have to learn to live with someone else their age. There is also no mention of Colin taking pictures and getting jealous of Mary and Dickon in the book. It's an innocent story, why put a modern spin of heated tension between two kids? I do have to admit, seeing it again, that Sleezeball Gerry from Sliding Doors playing Uncle Archie was a bit of a treat. John Lynch is an underrated actor, and I hope to see him as a truly good guy someday. Dame Maggie was very good as the Icy Miss Metlock. I never liked the character, and I still don't. Well done. Someday, maybe before I pass on to my own garden, I will see a version that is truly faithful to the book, with great child actors (the 1949 version is hard to watch because even though the best child actors of the time are in it, they still seem wooden) who actually speak with British accents and a Mary who goes from crisp, Indian influenced British to Cockney. A version that gives us a Mrs. Sowerby and a scene in which Martha talks to her mother about the sour, little, girl. A Dickon who inspires Mary and Colin. While the book continues to run swells in my heart, no movie version of this book has done the same. Oh, and don't even get me started on the versions of A Little Princess. All I can say is that putting a little African descended scullery maid (read slave) in Victorian England would make William Wilberforce (See the movie or read Amazing Grace) turn in his grave. -K ","genre":null},{"date":"16 July 2010","score":"","review":" I remember seeing this in the movie theatre with my college roommate and my best friend.

There were times I felt I should have grown up in Japan, because all of my favorite media products came from that great island nation. Godzilla and Pokemon. Those were my two obsessions. Yes, I was one of millions from around the globe who collected the trading cards and checked in on the television show and played the video-games (I still have a soft spot for the N64 game Pokemon Stadium) and watched the movies when they popped up here in the U.S. Pokemon continued to ride strong in my interests until after a while, when they created more than 151 little fighting monsters and things just bogged down to the point where they were excessively juvenile and just dumb. It was the same syndrome that momentarily struck Godzilla in the 70s. The king of the monsters recovered, but Pokemon didn't. It sank away for me, and many and although Pokemon is still around and still (fairly) popular with the younger generation, it no longer has the cult status it once ruled with.But just because I am no longer swamped with obsession does not mean I cannot still feel the joy of this innocent little saga looking back on it as an adult. Yes, before you question me, I still enjoy the Pokemon movie. In fact, I enjoy both of them, especially Pokemon 2000. But this review concerns the first one, released in 1999. For those who do not know, there are a lot of Pokemon, but one in particular, called Mew, is the strongest of them all. One day, some fiddling scientists clone from Mew's DNA a newer, stronger beast called Mewtwo a psychic creature infuriated by how Pokemon seem to have become slaves to humans. And very slowly, he begins to set up a trap to restore Pokemon to what he feels is their rightful place in the world, at the top. Once again we rendezvous with our heroes, as the narrator calls them, from the TV show. There's Ash Ketchum, Misty, Brock, and of course, the little lightning-surged rodent Pikachu. After a prologue revolving around Mewtwo, we dive in with them.There is a lot of advertisement in Pokemon The First Movie. It is very much a merchandise exploitation to further the interest of kids in the cards, games, and series. But kids endorse these sort of things. I know, because I remember I did when I was eight or so and saw the movie for the first time. I mean, what kid wouldn't like to have an army of monsters at his command and be able to duke them out with other monsters? It's like having Godzilla and Mothra and Rodan at your command.What I really liked about Pokemon The First Movie then and now is that, like Godzilla, it's innocent and goodhearted fun. It's not meant to be taken too seriously, and nobody does, and it is inoffensive, harmless, joyful, and really nostalgia-stirring. It's also enjoyable because it makes the best out of what it has. The Japanese animation, even the movie's detractors note, is eye candy. It's rich, colorful, and fun to look at. I also enjoy twists in the story, such as how one of Ash's Pokemon, a dragon-like thing called Charizard, refuses to obey its master. There's personality in the Pokemon, in Mewtwo, and especially in Pikachu, who dare I say it, is actually kind of adorable as far as animated, imaginary animals are concerned. There is a lot of personality in this little rodent, especially in the eyes, which are well-animated, and in its voice. There's also a trio of bumbling villains, two rockstar would-be secret agents and their talking cat Meowth, who have some very funny moments as they try to make a good impression for their boss by kidnapping Pikachu. There's also the emphasis on whether or not Pokemon and humans are really master and slave or friend and friend.If I do have anything negative to say about the movie it is the fact that it really just feels like an extended version of a TV episode rather than a feature film. A movie adaptation needs to push the boundaries and expand rather than just use the same material at greater pacing. That's why I personally prefer Pokemon 2000 because it does what I mentioned.That's all I have to say in a bad manner.I know I will have a lot of insulting comments thrown in my direction, but I see nothing wrong with number one, having liked Pokemon in my youth, and number two, still mildly enjoying Pokemon as an adult, looking back on a time when I was more innocent, more open-minded, and more willing to accept things that were outside of what we were supposed to like and not like. Some may choose to call me childish for liking Pokemon The Movie. I think the proper term would be young-at-heart.

In fact, more often than not, the scares come from what you don't see rather than what you actually do.The acting is definitely a strong point in the film. The entire cast has their moments of brilliance during the insanity Hell House is putting them through, but Roddy McDowall is the actor who stands out amongst the rest. His performance just seems to outshine everyone else and he steals just about every scene he's in. There's a scene in the film where he starts screaming and falls to the floor in a seizure like maneuver that reminded me a lot of some of the scenes with Bruce Campbell in Evil Dead. The explanation was that he was blocking himself off from the house since he had been there before. As a physical medium, he was basically putting up walls to defend himself from the house this time around. And in this scene, I guess he tried lowering his guard for a bit and...this happened. The speeches he gives though, his facial expressions and body language, and cold tone. It's weird, but a guy that you look at at the beginning of the film and say to yourself that you're going to hate him because he looks smarmy and only really cares about himself winds up being the highlight of the film.Another aspect of the film I really enjoyed were the special effects of the film. There's no CGI or anything, but the effects in the film are done very well. There's a scene where Ms. Tanner looks into her bedroom and sees someone lying under the covers in her bed and when she lifts up the covers, you can't see anyone but the door opens and slams like someone was getting up and leaving.

There are a few that look cheesy(cat in the shower scene, anyone?), but overall they look very good given how old the film is.The plot was surprising, as well.

It probably isn't the type of horror film for gorehounds or if you're looking for a bloodfest. It's more of a paranormal film with a slight psychological twist.

It stars Richard Gere, Edward Norton & Laura Linney. With support coming from John Mahoney, Frances McDormand, Alfre Woodard, Andre Braugher, Steven Bauer, Terry O'Quinn & Maura Tierney. Cinematography is by Michael Chapman and the score is composed by James Newton Howard.High profile lawyer Martin Vail (Gere) loves his own press, hugely successful he never misses the chance to further his profile. So when altar boy Aaron Stampler (Norton) is arrested for the vicious slaying of a prominent archbishop, Vail spies an opportunity for major publicity. However, it looks a slam dunk case of guilt, Stampler is a simple kid who was caught after running from the scene of the crime-covered in the archbishop's blood. But Vail comes to believe Stampler to be innocent, something that baffles the prosecution, led by Vail's ex lover, Janet Venable (Linney). A turn of events will further complicate matters and Vail finds that the longer the case goes on, the dirtier the whole episode gets.Now seen as the launch pad to Edward Norton's career (for this his debut film he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and won a Golden Globe Award in the same category), Primal Fear is a tightly written thriller that sits with the better modern day entries in the court room based genre. The secret to a successful court room thriller is being able to keep the drama flowing before the verdict comes to pass. Hoblit's film does this because it has a ripper (no pun intended towards the nature of the crime) of a case at its core and that in turn is developed expertly by an on fire cast. The makers are also aware that the very best court room thrillers are able to make the viewers part of the jury. Again Primal Fear scores high marks here as we are privy to many secrets, we are involved with all the major players, yet crucially we don't know the truth as there are no give aways. We have intently watched Stampler, looking for clues as to if he did it, hung on his every word, his expressions and so forth. But the makers, and Norton give nothing to us, what surprises come, are just that, surprises, because they have not been clumsily set up earlier in the movie.Norton is terrific, it's actually a performance that pays bigger rewards on a revisit to the film. For then you see just how he had to play his cards close to his chest throughout the piece. It's not all about Norton shining, tho. Gere is always a watchable actor, especially when he's playing a competent-power player type character that blends smarm with charm. It often gets overlooked just how comfortable he is to let the actors he works with dominate scenes he shares with them. One of the most reliable and unselfish actors of the modern era, watch his interplay with Norton and see how Norton positively feeds off of Gere's lead work. The support cast is solidly deep, with an early Linney performance to savour as she gives Janet a spikiness that makes for a formidable opponent to Vail's assuredness. Michael Chapman's photography deserves a mention for keeping the film tonally dark throughout, while the smooth editing by David Rosenbloom is particularly impressive for the out of court scenes as the many characters are woven into the story.A taut film with genuine moments of suspense, smart surprises and backed up by two contrasting, but equally great, lead performances. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 July 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Primal Fear is directed by Gregory Hoblit and is adapted by Steve Shagan & Ann Biderman from William Diehl's 1993 novel.

A turn of events will further complicate matters and Vail finds that the longer the case goes on, the dirtier the whole episode gets.Now seen as the launch pad to Edward Norton's career (for this his debut film he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and won a Golden Globe Award in the same category), Primal Fear is a tightly written thriller that sits with the better modern day entries in the court room based genre. The secret to a successful court room thriller is being able to keep the drama flowing before the verdict comes to pass. Hoblit's film does this because it has a ripper (no pun intended towards the nature of the crime) of a case at its core and that in turn is developed expertly by an on fire cast. The makers are also aware that the very best court room thrillers are able to make the viewers part of the jury. Again Primal Fear scores high marks here as we are privy to many secrets, we are involved with all the major players, yet crucially we don't know the truth as there are no give aways. We have intently watched Stampler, looking for clues as to if he did it, hung on his every word, his expressions and so forth. But the makers, and Norton give nothing to us, what surprises come, are just that, surprises, because they have not been clumsily set up earlier in the movie.Norton is terrific, it's actually a performance that pays bigger rewards on a revisit to the film. For then you see just how he had to play his cards close to his chest throughout the piece. It's not all about Norton shining, tho. Gere is always a watchable actor, especially when he's playing a competent-power player type character that blends smarm with charm. It often gets overlooked just how comfortable he is to let the actors he works with dominate scenes he shares with them. One of the most reliable and unselfish actors of the modern era, watch his interplay with Norton and see how Norton positively feeds off of Gere's lead work. The support cast is solidly deep, with an early Linney performance to savour as she gives Janet a spikiness that makes for a formidable opponent to Vail's assuredness. Michael Chapman's photography deserves a mention for keeping the film tonally dark throughout, while the smooth editing by David Rosenbloom is particularly impressive for the out of court scenes as the many characters are woven into the story.A taut film with genuine moments of suspense, smart surprises and backed up by two contrasting, but equally great, lead performances. 8\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"16 July 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Primal Fear is directed by Gregory Hoblit and is adapted by Steve Shagan & Ann Biderman from William Diehl's 1993 novel. It stars Richard Gere, Edward Norton & Laura Linney. With support coming from John Mahoney, Frances McDormand, Alfre Woodard, Andre Braugher, Steven Bauer, Terry O'Quinn & Maura Tierney.

So when altar boy Aaron Stampler (Norton) is arrested for the vicious slaying of a prominent archbishop, Vail spies an opportunity for major publicity. However, it looks a slam dunk case of guilt, Stampler is a simple kid who was caught after running from the scene of the crime-covered in the archbishop's blood.

'Blood and wine' was the third part in the trilogy. Rafelson's movies were very unique in their own way with Nicholson. His movies were very highly focused on relationships and this formed the core in every movie. In 'Blood and wine' Nicholson is playing the father and son and again delivers another fantastic performance. Regardless of the role, Nicholson is always in top form and most times has the ability carry the movie independently. The noir atmosphere is not continuously present in the movie. The theme of betrayal, greed and loyalty is common to all in this genre and the movie covers this field on a large scale. The only noir factor that missing is the femme fa tale element. However this does not take away any charm from the movie. Many intriguing and suspenseful moments are directed in a unique way that makes the movie's routine theme appear eye capturing. In the initial phase of the movie one would immediately assume that this is a heist movie. However the second half dispels all doubts.The basic theme revolves around the theft of a expensive diamond necklace and how bitter relations leads the characters in to a game of cat and mouse. The character interactions in the second half progresses the movie steadily and there is never a irrelevant segment. In terms of plot, the writer (Nick Viltues) has accomplished some good writing but many criticised the movie for it's lack of character depth and even for it's climax. In my opinion only on a re watch the movie's real quality can be appreciated. If one views the movie with concentration and focus, he\/she will realise that the u.s.p of the movie is in the performances and dialogues. 'Blood and wine' is not a classic but truly a milestone for introducing the noir genre in to the nineties. Later movies like 'U Turn' and 'Lost Highway' followed.SPOILERS AHEAD Nicholson plays a wine merchant who is having a bitter relationship with his wife (Davis) and son (Dorff). His neglecting attitude has created a rift in relations in the household. He and Caine who plays a ageing safe-cracker on parole plan to steal a expensive necklace from the a rich family's residence while they are on vacation. They aim to achieve to do this with the help of a maid played by (Lopez). On the day they plan to steal they discover the maid has lost her job, however with a little inconvenience the pair still manage to get their hands on the necklace. Nicholson plans to travel to New York to sale it for a good price. He books a flight with Lopez who he is having an affair with. Unfortunately his wife discovers this which leads to a brawl and Nicholson becomes unconscious. Dorff arrives on the scene and him and his mother escape. Later Nicholson awakes and finds out that they took the suitcase that the necklace was hidden in. Him and Caine try to locate the mother and son but a high speed pursuit turns nasty which leads to the death of Dorff's mother. After this Dorff decides to get revenge with genius methods. He pits Caine against Nicholson and attempts to lure Nicholson with the necklace with the aid of Lopez. END OF SPOILERSFor a small thriller the movie extracts brilliant performances from all involved. This element is the core of the movie and brings out life from a routine script. Plot twists are at a minimum however this does not deters ones' enjoyment from the movie. Every clever surprising plot development that occurs happens to the viewer's attention. Bob Rafelson's direction is standard and is in tone with the movies theme. Many close up shots of the character's faces are mesmerising. It captures feelings and emotions very realistically. Florida has become a common setting for movies of this nature. Body Heat, Palmetto and Wild things too used this location. This is another highlight for the movie but many scenes are shot indoors so outdoor scenery is restricted to a certain extent. The background score is very thin. It is not used at every point. Music is incorporated at moments when it can feel most effective with the scene. This was the first time pairing of Micheal Caine and Jack Nicholson. They are legends in their own right and make the movie worthy of watching whenever they appear on screen together. Their interactions and witticism are a highlight in the movie.

He was an upcoming star and his facial and emotional expressions are on the mark.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"16 July 2010","score":"","review":" Harper Lee's famous novel came out in 1960 and this film adaptation followed only two years later, by which time the book was already starting to take on the status of a classic. The story is set in the fictional Maycomb County, Alabama, during the depression era of the 1930s, and is told through the eyes of a young girl named Jean Louise Finch who, for some unexplained reason, goes by the nickname Scout. She and her older brother Jem are the children of Atticus Finch, a widowed lawyer.As in the book, the film's central incident is the trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, for the alleged rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell; Atticus is Robinson's defence attorney. Harper Lee was using a classic thriller plot- the fight to prove the innocence of a man wrongly accused- to explore racism in America's Deep South. (William Faulkner had done something similar in his novel Intruder in the Dust, later made into an excellent film by Clarence Brown). Although Robinson is clearly innocent of the charge, the all-white jury nevertheless vote to convict him, largely because to admit that a white woman, even one as sluttish as Mayella, was capable of making false accusations against a black man would force them to abandon their cherished ideas about the purity of Southern womanhood.Lee's novel is more than just a courtroom drama, more than a study of racism in the Deep South. It is also a coming-of-age novel in which Scout and Jem, who begin as innocent children, are forced to confront the evil which lurks in their tranquil-seeming town and in which they learn important lessons about tolerance. A favourite saying of their father, who believes that most people, when you get to know them, are essentially kind, is that you should never judge a man until you have stood in his shoes and walked around in them. Atticus applies this principle not only to racial issues but also to various acquaintances whom his children dislike or disapprove of for one reason or another. Most importantly he applies it to Boo Radley, a simple-minded and reclusive neighbour, who is regarded by the local people with either fear, suspicion or mockery but who turns out to be inwardly brave and kindly.The title of both book and film refers to a saying of Atticus that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because they never do any harm, but it is a phrase which also refers to his philosophy of life. At various times several characters in the book- Robinson, Boo Radley, the children- can be seen as mockingbirds, harmless creatures in need of protection.Like most movies based upon novels, the film makes a few changes from the plot of the book, and omits certain episodes such as the subplot about the cantankerous, elderly Mrs. Dubose and her battle to overcome her opiate addiction. Its few faults are generally those of the book as well. For example, I have always felt that Lee never really explores the tension between Atticus's liberal philosophy of life and the problem of human evil as exemplified by the book's main villain Bob Ewell, Mayella's father. Ewell is neither misjudged nor misunderstood but just plain wicked; not only does he give perjured evidence in the hope of getting an innocent man sent to the gallows, and encourages his daughter to do the same, he also makes a vicious and cowardly attack on Atticus's children. Trying to stand in such a man's shoes would not, I feel, be a very productive exercise.Nevertheless, the film is for the most part a faithful adaptation of the book and, most importantly, remains faithful to its spirit. Its faults are greatly outweighed by its merits, chief of which must be the performance of Gregory Peck, perhaps his greatest ever, with the possible exception of The Big Country. Peck was himself well-known for his liberal opinions, and Atticus Finch- kindly, rational, tolerant, gentlemanly and both physically and morally courageous- was the sort of role he excelled in playing. Of the other acting contributions the one that stands out the most is from the young Mary Badham who makes an enchanting heroine as Scout. Robert Duvall is also good in his film debut as Boo Radley.Peck deservedly won an Oscar for his performance. The film itself was nominated for Best Picture, but lost out to Lawrence of Arabia. Although that film has its merits, including another great performance from Peter O'Toole and some spectacular camera-work, I have always regarded it as a rather diffuse, sprawling work, lacking the concision and emotional power of To Kill a Mockingbird. Perhaps David Lean's film won out because in the early sixties it seemed to represent the way the Hollywood was going. After the success of the likes of Bridge on the River Kwai, Ben Hur and Spartacus, it looked as though the future of the movie industry lay with the grand epic. (That style of film-making, although it produced some great movies while it lasted, was starting to look outdated by the end of the decade).Robert Mulligan's film, by contrast, probably looked rather old-fashioned, with its more modest scale, small-town setting and monochrome photography. (Two years earlier the Academy had given The Apartment the last Best Picture award it would ever give to a film in black-and-white, apart from Schindler's List more than thirty years later). Today, however, we can recognise To Kill a Mockingbird as one of the cinematic achievements of 20th century, a moving human story, well-told and well-acted. One of the things the cinema does best. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 July 2010","score":"","review":" Harper Lee's famous novel came out in 1960 and this film adaptation followed only two years later, by which time the book was already starting to take on the status of a classic.

I hope Hollywood doesn't pee on this classic by making a remake with Jack Black or some other supposedly funny bozo! What makes this movie so memorable is probably all the different characters that get involved in it. Almost every famous actor or actress in Hollywood at the time starred in it. And for the other famous ones, they probably were one of the dozens of cameo appearances in this. It's a comedy, it's an action film, and above all it's a character film. The writers really had to be creative to think up all these diverse characters which you come to know through this film's incredible length.The movie follows a group of regular hard working people who are all driving along the same highway when this speeding car passes them up and goes shooting off a cliff crash landing on jagged rocks. From this point on, the movie just gets crazier and crazier! The people behind the crashed car all stop and go down to see if the driver is alright. He's still alive but hovering over the edge. So, then he goes on to tell this group of people that there is over million dollars in cash buried under a 'big W' in California (they are already in CA. I forget where he tells them the money exactly is.) So all these people set out on a quest to try and get this money before others do. This group of people trying to get the money are like a snowball rolling down a steep hill getting bigger, bigger, and bigger! I say this because they collect so many other people along the way!The characters are so unique, that I could probably just do a review talking about all the characters. But what made the characters even stand out even better was the handful of talented actors and actresses they had play them! There were so many unique and hilarious actors and actresses back then! And they never had to tell you a sex joke to make you laugh, or spew out profanity! Aside from it being a character film, it's also a great action films, containing some of the best stunt work and car chase sequences in the history of cinema....EVER!! What makes the action sequences so great is that they are so cartoon-like. That's what makes them memorable. And boys and girls.... no , I repeat , no special effects used once so ever for any of these action sequences (except the unavoidable occasional green screen.) This film is mandatory!!

But is just how terrible it is that makes it watchable. It is hysterical just how ridiculously bad this film is. Mr. Wood thought he was a filmmaker and never gave up, and for that you have to give him a lot of credit. Especially when he can make a film as absurdly bad as this and get away with it.Plan 9 From Outer Space is about an alien race that, after eight failures to stop the human race from making (stick with me here) something called a Solarite which is a sort of sun-driven bomb (just stay with me). Their plan... to resurrect the dead (did I lose you? Yeah. Figures.) The humans try what they can to destroy the strange alien spacecraft (which are small plastic models hanging from strings) but they are unsuccessful. What the aliens intentions are with these zombies isn't exactly explained, but does it really matter at this point? We do know that they are controlled with the alien's plastic electrode guns which sometimes don't work as well as they should (it's a 50-50 shot). Are you confused yet? Well trust me, watching the film will probably make it worse.The most fun thing about Plan 9 is just being able to see what happens when you put the power of cinema in the hands of the most incompetent such as Ed Wood. You won't believe your eyes while watching this hilariously atrocious excuse for a movie. It is truly amazing to see what happens when a man like Ed Wood makes a movie whilst having absolutely no idea what he is doing. The saddest thing about the film is that while watching it you can clearly see the Ed Wood's intentions of what he wanted Plan 9 From Outer Space to be like. And that is an epic sci-fi horror masterpiece, complete with mind bending special effects, a gripping and terrifying plot, and even a glaring political statement on the state of the world. Unfortunately, he went about every aspect of the movie 100% wrong. The result was indeed the worst movie ever made.

However if you look at this movie at it from the perspective of the time that it got made in, it's being a great genre movie, that is original as well.As far as alien-invasion movies go, the story for Invasion of the Body Snatchers always have been one of the best and certainly most original ones around. It's also being a somewhat realistic story, at least when you compare it to all of the other genre movies that came out around the same years as this one did.The set-up of the story is great and very effective. It's being mysterious and the movie doesn't try to explain too much which only adds more to the mystery, that in return also adds more to the tension of the movie. You could say that it's a minimalistic movie, which works out very well. The movie didn't even cost halve a million to make and it didn't had the backing of any big studio's.It's a bit surprising that this movie got directed by Don Siegel. A man that isn't exactly well known for being a director in the science-fiction genre. His action movies and westerns are far better known and he's best known for his collaborations with Clint Eastwood. This is just not the type of movie which you would normally expect from him. It shows his much wider range as a director and his talent for it of course.And then the eternal question of which movie is better; the original or the remake. And with remake I of course mean the 1978 version, not any of the other ones. In my opinion it's the remake that is being the better movie. It does more with its main premise and has a better, more mysterious and tense story. But in all honesty, both movies are also quite different from each other. They basically have different plot-lines, different settings, different story-telling and different characters in it. Both can easily be seen as totally independent from each other movies, that you can both watch and enjoy and see as two different movies, that only share the same main premise with each other.A very effective- and original for its time, movie.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"16 July 2010","score":"","review":" First of all, I can definitely see how this movie feels and looks outdated to some people.
