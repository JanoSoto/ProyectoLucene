C3PO and R2 had once decent scene but their limited screentime is due to the fact that George had to showcase his cgi's in terrible scenes like that Diner scene. EWWWWW!!!!bad. Special affect's are nice but nothing beats a good ol cheap mini set of a Millenium Falcon cockpit with Han getting on Leia and C3PO annoying the hell out of them with his nagging, squabbling and yelling with Chewie grunting in the background resulting in me laughing my butt off. Where's that Star Wars Magic George? Well, The Phantom Menace didnt have it and Attack of the Clones sure didnt. I was impressed though, a few scenes were jaw dropping, and I must admit Hayden Christiansen, stole the show by far. It was nice to see how crazy he is becoming and how in one scene in particular, was the best in the movie I think, where he explains and admits to Padme how crazy he acted. I thought that scene had the most emotion. The movie drags a bit after that. Obi-wan played by Ewan McGregor was a success also. He spends the whole time playing detective trying to find out who is planning on killing Senator Amidala. Decent Plot twists though, much, much better than episode 1. I loved the ending, not the colisseum scene, where dozens of jedi confused the hell out of me, not knowing who is who, and not caring who got killed or survived.

It is also very rare, despite seeing movies that I have enjoyed immensely, that at some point I don't glance at my watch to see what time it is.  Well, Attack of the Clones has now been the first movie to not only make me ignore time all together - and wish the movie would go on forever - but to draw out goose bumps on several occasions!If anyone has come to this site to read reviews, you don't need background information on the plot, since it's posted everywhere across the universe. I won't bore you with meaningless details.One thing that is universal for all movie go-ers, is that the act of watching a movie is a very personal experience.  Your reactions to the characters, the plot, the dialogue - all of those aspects that come together to form a movie - comes from within.  Granted, some reactions are the similar among different people, but none will ever be exactly the same. As a result, I ask every person who has read reviews, checked the star-ratings, and been discouraged to clear your mind of all preconceptions you may have about this movie.  In my experience, critics - professional or amateur - are negative.  It is human nature to try and tear down what we know others put on a pedestal.  Star Wars, clearly, is no exception to this rule.  Episode I, despite being probably the least-exciting of the series, is still, in my opinion, a fantastic film.  I will even go so far to say that there are aspects of it that I enjoy even more than the gem I just saw in Episode II! However, critics refuse to allow for even a modicum of positive reactions to it, for reasons that quite frankly are beyond my comprehension.  Jealousy? Who knows.  The fact of the matter is, they are giving the masses something unexpected - a negative review of a movie empire that for some it is absolutely impossible to see as bad.  The unexpected sells.  Plain and simple.Episode II critiques are no different, and I think this would be the perfect outlet to remark on the worst critiques I've read so far.Point 1  The dialogue.  Everyone whines and complains about the dialogue, that it's wooden, without feeling, and just plain boring.  (Show me a Star Wars film from the original trilogy that doesn't have the same aspects.) However, I think after seeing Episode II, there IS a method to that madness. And it becomes clear with the opening of each movie - `A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.'  I would like any one person to point out a moment in history when someone went up to another individual of the same time period and said, `Yo, wassap?'  History, if anything, shows that educated people were extremely formal and stiff!  This stiffness entered every aspect of their lives, whether it be dialogue, the way they walk, or the way they conduct themselves anywhere!  Star Wars is no different.  We have a young woman brought up to be a Queen and then a State Senator, raised by people who are well versed in proper `etiquette and protocol.'  Amidala, played by Natalie Portman, is a character that will be formal for all of her life. Granted, her stiffness isn't what it was in the first one, but it will never disappear completely.  Notice in the dialogue the almost complete absence of contractions - won't, can't, don't, etc.  This is not the effect of bad writing - but quite the opposite.  This is the tightness of the script that George Lucas writes, effectively giving his characters lines that would seem to stem from their very nature.  Lucas maintains unbelievable control over his characters, and the dialogue becomes only one aspect of this.  Han Solo, a man with absolutely no formal training whatsoever, and Luke, are the very few people who have dialogue that sounds more modern and loose.  Not until Return of the Jedi, after Luke has had much training, do we see his dialogue become formal like the rest of the Jedi.  I think critics who complain about the dialogue need to be shot for stupidity.  Their failure to recognize these facts detracts from everything or anything they might ever say.  If what they call `problems' arise again and again, you would think at some point one might assume that it was intended to be such.  I would hope that those people writing these reviews for newspapers would be educated enough to make these kinds of assumptions, but it appears that is not the case. 'Nuff said about that.Point 2  Over-use of special effects.  Please.  Please.  Please.  All Star Wars movies utilize the technology of their times to the absolute limit and go beyond.  Even looking at the original (A New Hope), which by today's standards has laughable special effects, George Lucas was unbelievable. The same is true of Episode II.  I've read reviews that say there is too much and that it almost resembles a video game.  Yeah, well, go watch Final Fantasy The Spirits Within.  Episode II creates scenarios with special effects that are necessary for the plot to progress.  It is laughable that people criticize this movie for having too many special effects, or what I would say, too much of a good thing.  Science Fiction is all about the use of imagination, of what we dream about but can never realize in reality - at least, not yet.  This is George Lucas' vision.  It is HIS story.  This is how HE wants it to look.  If you have a problem with that, don't go see the movie.  Or, give George a call and tell him what you think.  I'm sure all of your opinions will carry great weight in altering his intentions for Episode III.Point 3  Hayden Christensen.  I've read lots of complaints about him, and quite frankly, I'm shocked.  Anakin Skywalker\/Darth Vader is perhaps one of the most complex and tragic characters ever to grace the screen.  Granted, the abilities of Jake Lloyd in Episode I were, in my opinion at least, not up to par for the first screen appearance of such a legendary character. And he is legendary.  Only 3 characters graces the screen in all 6 of the Star Wars movies (presumably)  Anakin\/Vader, C-3P0, and R2-D2. Hayden Christensen plays the part beautifully.  This is a young man raised by educated, strict Jedi; he is very formal - I'm sorry, as the critics would say, he is very wooden and lifeless.  What a load of crap.  Anakin Skywalker is in constant contention with himself.  His internal struggles between good and evil (light and dark) create this very formal, stiff, and tortured character.  We see the beginning of his dark side in Episode II, and as Master Yoda says, `Once you travel the path of the dark side, forever will it dominate your destiny.'  Christensen is brilliant as Anakin in this film. He, like most Jedi, is not permitted to show emotion.  How can we call this bad acting when the very code of the Jedi says `A Jedi shall not know anger, nor hatred, nor love, nor fear.'  These men are TRAINED to be robots - deadly robots.  This is not the inability of an actor the play a part; it is the complete emersion of an actor IN to the part he is playing.  And the death scene with his mother that is so criticized?  I'm sorry, how passionate are you when you're 3 seconds away from dying?  And what do you have to say to someone in front of you who is dying.  These is so much to say, and so much that just can't be said.  Anakin himself is even more restricted by his inability to cope with his emotions.Point 4  Plot progression.  Darn.  We're not getting a no-brainer movie that any idiot can sit through without having to think.  We actually might have to use our brains while viewing this film.  Woe to the under-educated generation of American movie-goers that will be lost.  The formation of the Star Wars universe took much more than the final 3 episodes (A New Hope - Return of the Jedi) let on.  Hell, the final 3 have it EASY.  It's just a war that is being fought. Politically, Palpatine has already gained total control.  Now he just uses it.   Episode I and II (possibly III) HAVE to focus somewhat on the political motivations behind the events that take place.  I think it would be much worse to have someone explain it to me on screen than to see it happen.  I don't want to be lectured.  Frankly, Episode I and II have the most complex plots of any Star Wars film.  And this aspect doesn't go over well with those people who are going only for special effects and fighting (and then, they proceed to whine about too much or not enough of one or the other).Point 5  The Love Story.  Well, I've already touched on, I think, why people are calling the love story fake and without emotion.  It all goes back to the characters involved.  A Jedi, trained never to love, and a Senator\/Queen, raised to be formal and dutiful.  These are two people who are experiencing these emotions for perhaps the very first time in their lives!  And they are young!  Anakin is only, what, 16-17 years old?  And Amidala?  I think she was supposed to be 14 in Phantom Menace, so that puts her at 24 now.  These are two people conditioned to ignore their emotions, to feel nothing, to be compelled only by duty.  Episode II remains true to this characterization about both of them.  They are both on new ground here, awkward ground, and dangerous ground.  I don't think you're ever going to see the passion that we see in other movies here, at least not in ways that people will expect.  I think that much more will be revealed subtly rather than overtly.  Any idiot can sit through a chick flick and realize that idiot A is in love with idiot B, and heck, they can even have REASONS that they CAN'T be.  But, were they raised never to love?  Never to give in to the human side of emotions?  I think not.  Christensen and Portman again stay true to the characters they are playing in these `unexciting and unimpassioned' love scenes.  Again, must have gone RIGHT over the critics' heads, that little point there.Well, I'm done addressing the critics.  They get too much publicity anyway, as far as I'm concerned.  They also get too much weight.  Forget them.  Go to the movie and make your own assumptions about it.  Here are mine.This is an extraordinarily beautiful film.On a scale of 1 to 5 (for the 5 Star Wars movies thus far) this is definitely the best in my opinion - a 5.  I've been a fan of Star Wars since birth.  I've got all the action figures from the original movies, everything.  I was obsessed with Darth Vader and the power he radiated, and I still am today - and I see it in Anakin Skywalker.  The very way he carries himself, his arrogance, his complete lack of humility, everything Vader becomes is foreshadowed in Christensen's portrayal of the tragic, young Jedi.  For me, all aspects of this movie shine.  Combining the fabulous acting of Christensen, Portman, and Ewan McGregor - who is becoming more and more like the Alec Guinness Obi-Wan all the time, as well as supporting roles of Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Ian McDiarmid, the fantastic special effects, the breathtaking scenery, and blood-racing action, John Williams' brilliant score, and the legendary feeling associated with any Star Wars film, Lucas has created a masterpiece in Attack of the Clones.The best parts of the movie  Yoda!  I must concede to every other review I've read - Yoda is unbelievable.  I must admit, I questioned his `prowess' as a Jedi Master since Empire Strikes Back, and never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined him with a lightsabre.  Wow!  The duel between Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Dooku is impressive to say the least (though I must admit, I enjoyed the Darth Maul\/Qui-Gon\/Obi-Wan battle much more).  The cinematography is breathtaking, like in many of the Star Wars films.  John Williams' score is excellent, though I missed songs like Duel of Fates that are just so incredible with the scene.We are experiencing the imagination of a genius embodied in George Lucas. And you know, we're all better people because of it.  By what standards could we hold truly magnificent films to if there were never any Star Wars?I am more than thrilled with this installment, and I wish Episode III would come out next week!  It saddens me that I have to wait until 2005 to see the conclusion of such an awesome (and I mean that in the literal sense awe-some) cinematic experience.  It's been maybe an hour since I left the theatre, and I think I'll go buy myself some tickets to a showing later tonight.  Actually, I just did.Bottom line - Star Wars is BACK!!!  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  Ignore your preconceptions, and go and have a good time.  Go and experience cinematic perfection at its best.

Episode I, despite being probably the least-exciting of the series, is still, in my opinion, a fantastic film.  I will even go so far to say that there are aspects of it that I enjoy even more than the gem I just saw in Episode II! However, critics refuse to allow for even a modicum of positive reactions to it, for reasons that quite frankly are beyond my comprehension.  Jealousy? Who knows.  The fact of the matter is, they are giving the masses something unexpected - a negative review of a movie empire that for some it is absolutely impossible to see as bad.  The unexpected sells.  Plain and simple.Episode II critiques are no different, and I think this would be the perfect outlet to remark on the worst critiques I've read so far.Point 1  The dialogue.  Everyone whines and complains about the dialogue, that it's wooden, without feeling, and just plain boring.  (Show me a Star Wars film from the original trilogy that doesn't have the same aspects.) However, I think after seeing Episode II, there IS a method to that madness. And it becomes clear with the opening of each movie - `A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.'  I would like any one person to point out a moment in history when someone went up to another individual of the same time period and said, `Yo, wassap?'  History, if anything, shows that educated people were extremely formal and stiff!  This stiffness entered every aspect of their lives, whether it be dialogue, the way they walk, or the way they conduct themselves anywhere!  Star Wars is no different.  We have a young woman brought up to be a Queen and then a State Senator, raised by people who are well versed in proper `etiquette and protocol.'  Amidala, played by Natalie Portman, is a character that will be formal for all of her life. Granted, her stiffness isn't what it was in the first one, but it will never disappear completely.  Notice in the dialogue the almost complete absence of contractions - won't, can't, don't, etc.  This is not the effect of bad writing - but quite the opposite.  This is the tightness of the script that George Lucas writes, effectively giving his characters lines that would seem to stem from their very nature.  Lucas maintains unbelievable control over his characters, and the dialogue becomes only one aspect of this.  Han Solo, a man with absolutely no formal training whatsoever, and Luke, are the very few people who have dialogue that sounds more modern and loose.  Not until Return of the Jedi, after Luke has had much training, do we see his dialogue become formal like the rest of the Jedi.  I think critics who complain about the dialogue need to be shot for stupidity.  Their failure to recognize these facts detracts from everything or anything they might ever say.  If what they call `problems' arise again and again, you would think at some point one might assume that it was intended to be such.  I would hope that those people writing these reviews for newspapers would be educated enough to make these kinds of assumptions, but it appears that is not the case. 'Nuff said about that.Point 2  Over-use of special effects.  Please.  Please.  Please.  All Star Wars movies utilize the technology of their times to the absolute limit and go beyond.  Even looking at the original (A New Hope), which by today's standards has laughable special effects, George Lucas was unbelievable. The same is true of Episode II.  I've read reviews that say there is too much and that it almost resembles a video game.  Yeah, well, go watch Final Fantasy The Spirits Within.  Episode II creates scenarios with special effects that are necessary for the plot to progress.  It is laughable that people criticize this movie for having too many special effects, or what I would say, too much of a good thing.  Science Fiction is all about the use of imagination, of what we dream about but can never realize in reality - at least, not yet.  This is George Lucas' vision.  It is HIS story.  This is how HE wants it to look.  If you have a problem with that, don't go see the movie.  Or, give George a call and tell him what you think.  I'm sure all of your opinions will carry great weight in altering his intentions for Episode III.Point 3  Hayden Christensen.  I've read lots of complaints about him, and quite frankly, I'm shocked.  Anakin Skywalker\/Darth Vader is perhaps one of the most complex and tragic characters ever to grace the screen.  Granted, the abilities of Jake Lloyd in Episode I were, in my opinion at least, not up to par for the first screen appearance of such a legendary character. And he is legendary.  Only 3 characters graces the screen in all 6 of the Star Wars movies (presumably)  Anakin\/Vader, C-3P0, and R2-D2. Hayden Christensen plays the part beautifully.  This is a young man raised by educated, strict Jedi; he is very formal - I'm sorry, as the critics would say, he is very wooden and lifeless.  What a load of crap.  Anakin Skywalker is in constant contention with himself.  His internal struggles between good and evil (light and dark) create this very formal, stiff, and tortured character.  We see the beginning of his dark side in Episode II, and as Master Yoda says, `Once you travel the path of the dark side, forever will it dominate your destiny.'  Christensen is brilliant as Anakin in this film. He, like most Jedi, is not permitted to show emotion.  How can we call this bad acting when the very code of the Jedi says `A Jedi shall not know anger, nor hatred, nor love, nor fear.'  These men are TRAINED to be robots - deadly robots.  This is not the inability of an actor the play a part; it is the complete emersion of an actor IN to the part he is playing.  And the death scene with his mother that is so criticized?  I'm sorry, how passionate are you when you're 3 seconds away from dying?  And what do you have to say to someone in front of you who is dying.  These is so much to say, and so much that just can't be said.  Anakin himself is even more restricted by his inability to cope with his emotions.Point 4  Plot progression.  Darn.  We're not getting a no-brainer movie that any idiot can sit through without having to think.  We actually might have to use our brains while viewing this film.  Woe to the under-educated generation of American movie-goers that will be lost.  The formation of the Star Wars universe took much more than the final 3 episodes (A New Hope - Return of the Jedi) let on.  Hell, the final 3 have it EASY.  It's just a war that is being fought. Politically, Palpatine has already gained total control.  Now he just uses it.   Episode I and II (possibly III) HAVE to focus somewhat on the political motivations behind the events that take place.  I think it would be much worse to have someone explain it to me on screen than to see it happen.  I don't want to be lectured.  Frankly, Episode I and II have the most complex plots of any Star Wars film.  And this aspect doesn't go over well with those people who are going only for special effects and fighting (and then, they proceed to whine about too much or not enough of one or the other).Point 5  The Love Story.  Well, I've already touched on, I think, why people are calling the love story fake and without emotion.  It all goes back to the characters involved.  A Jedi, trained never to love, and a Senator\/Queen, raised to be formal and dutiful.  These are two people who are experiencing these emotions for perhaps the very first time in their lives!  And they are young!  Anakin is only, what, 16-17 years old?  And Amidala?  I think she was supposed to be 14 in Phantom Menace, so that puts her at 24 now.  These are two people conditioned to ignore their emotions, to feel nothing, to be compelled only by duty.  Episode II remains true to this characterization about both of them.  They are both on new ground here, awkward ground, and dangerous ground.  I don't think you're ever going to see the passion that we see in other movies here, at least not in ways that people will expect.  I think that much more will be revealed subtly rather than overtly.  Any idiot can sit through a chick flick and realize that idiot A is in love with idiot B, and heck, they can even have REASONS that they CAN'T be.  But, were they raised never to love?  Never to give in to the human side of emotions?  I think not.  Christensen and Portman again stay true to the characters they are playing in these `unexciting and unimpassioned' love scenes.  Again, must have gone RIGHT over the critics' heads, that little point there.Well, I'm done addressing the critics.  They get too much publicity anyway, as far as I'm concerned.  They also get too much weight.  Forget them.  Go to the movie and make your own assumptions about it.  Here are mine.This is an extraordinarily beautiful film.On a scale of 1 to 5 (for the 5 Star Wars movies thus far) this is definitely the best in my opinion - a 5.  I've been a fan of Star Wars since birth.  I've got all the action figures from the original movies, everything.  I was obsessed with Darth Vader and the power he radiated, and I still am today - and I see it in Anakin Skywalker.  The very way he carries himself, his arrogance, his complete lack of humility, everything Vader becomes is foreshadowed in Christensen's portrayal of the tragic, young Jedi.  For me, all aspects of this movie shine.  Combining the fabulous acting of Christensen, Portman, and Ewan McGregor - who is becoming more and more like the Alec Guinness Obi-Wan all the time, as well as supporting roles of Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Ian McDiarmid, the fantastic special effects, the breathtaking scenery, and blood-racing action, John Williams' brilliant score, and the legendary feeling associated with any Star Wars film, Lucas has created a masterpiece in Attack of the Clones.The best parts of the movie  Yoda!  I must concede to every other review I've read - Yoda is unbelievable.  I must admit, I questioned his `prowess' as a Jedi Master since Empire Strikes Back, and never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined him with a lightsabre.  Wow!  The duel between Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Dooku is impressive to say the least (though I must admit, I enjoyed the Darth Maul\/Qui-Gon\/Obi-Wan battle much more).  The cinematography is breathtaking, like in many of the Star Wars films.  John Williams' score is excellent, though I missed songs like Duel of Fates that are just so incredible with the scene.We are experiencing the imagination of a genius embodied in George Lucas. And you know, we're all better people because of it.  By what standards could we hold truly magnificent films to if there were never any Star Wars?I am more than thrilled with this installment, and I wish Episode III would come out next week!  It saddens me that I have to wait until 2005 to see the conclusion of such an awesome (and I mean that in the literal sense awe-some) cinematic experience.  It's been maybe an hour since I left the theatre, and I think I'll go buy myself some tickets to a showing later tonight.  Actually, I just did.Bottom line - Star Wars is BACK!!!  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  Ignore your preconceptions, and go and have a good time.  Go and experience cinematic perfection at its best.

In fact, I believe that it is far far better than the original. And believe it or not I did not intend the pun reference to the opening line of the films.*SPOILER ALERT*Watching the manipulation of Palpatine over the entire Empire is extraordinarily impressive. Evil guy we're supposed to be rooting against or not, I really admire him now and have realized that for good or bad, at this point he deserves the Republic. After Episode I, I was just impressed with him, now I believe the man to be a total genius.The other reason I love the first trilogy is because (and of course it is needed for the set up to the original trilogy) the 'good guys' have lost big time in both movies (and you know they will have to completely crash and burn in Ep. III). However, in parts I and II, it is easily mistaken by those not paying attention (like Obi) that the good guys did save the day both times (albeit at some cost, but that's always the case). At least in Ep. II, Yoda is intelligent enough to verbally backslap Obi when he makes the comment claiming that things did come to the happy ending.Did I hate Jar Jar in Ep. I? Heck yeah. However I did like the fact that his antics were toned down in Ep. II (he had character development over 10 years) and that he himself became completely used as a pawn in the short air time he had. Frighteningly, that means the character actually had a point to being in the movie. I still hope his purpose in Ep. III is to help increase the body count by one, but we will see.----Senator Jar-Jar Why-sa you in black suit, Ani?Darth Vader raises his hand at Jar-Jar.Jar-Jar's head explodes.*splut**thud*Vader commences his only tap-dance number in the series on top of the body.----I can dream.Flaws with Ep. II? First off, I didn't buy the love story, at least not as it was presented. I bought it a little bit more after Anakin went off to 'rescue' Shmi, because that lead to a pity reaction from Padme that I thought could blossom the romance. But the stuff before it was trite and seemed written in purely for the reason that sooner or later the two will have to conceive the characters for the original series. The dialog was poorly done, more so than the other Star Wars films (which at least still had some real personality clashes; like Leia and Han, where the one liner zings that they kept nailing each other with).That is really my only complaint against Ep. II. So, my only suggestion George is to keep doing what you are doing, except when you get to the part in the script where you need to use these    summarize what needs to be said and let someone else write in the actual dialog based on your notes.Other than that, Ep. II was incredible. I especially loved the scenes involving the Fetts. It took a loved character from the original trilogy and severely expanded out everything about him.Excellent storytelling.

And believe it or not I did not intend the pun reference to the opening line of the films.*SPOILER ALERT*Watching the manipulation of Palpatine over the entire Empire is extraordinarily impressive.

After Episode I, I was just impressed with him, now I believe the man to be a total genius.The other reason I love the first trilogy is because (and of course it is needed for the set up to the original trilogy) the 'good guys' have lost big time in both movies (and you know they will have to completely crash and burn in Ep. III). However, in parts I and II, it is easily mistaken by those not paying attention (like Obi) that the good guys did save the day both times (albeit at some cost, but that's always the case). At least in Ep. II, Yoda is intelligent enough to verbally backslap Obi when he makes the comment claiming that things did come to the happy ending.Did I hate Jar Jar in Ep. I? Heck yeah. However I did like the fact that his antics were toned down in Ep. II (he had character development over 10 years) and that he himself became completely used as a pawn in the short air time he had. Frighteningly, that means the character actually had a point to being in the movie. I still hope his purpose in Ep. III is to help increase the body count by one, but we will see.----Senator Jar-Jar Why-sa you in black suit, Ani?Darth Vader raises his hand at Jar-Jar.Jar-Jar's head explodes.*splut**thud*Vader commences his only tap-dance number in the series on top of the body.----I can dream.Flaws with Ep. II? First off, I didn't buy the love story, at least not as it was presented. I bought it a little bit more after Anakin went off to 'rescue' Shmi, because that lead to a pity reaction from Padme that I thought could blossom the romance. But the stuff before it was trite and seemed written in purely for the reason that sooner or later the two will have to conceive the characters for the original series. The dialog was poorly done, more so than the other Star Wars films (which at least still had some real personality clashes; like Leia and Han, where the one liner zings that they kept nailing each other with).That is really my only complaint against Ep. II. So, my only suggestion George is to keep doing what you are doing, except when you get to the part in the script where you need to use these    summarize what needs to be said and let someone else write in the actual dialog based on your notes.Other than that, Ep. II was incredible. I especially loved the scenes involving the Fetts. It took a loved character from the original trilogy and severely expanded out everything about him.Excellent storytelling.

I'm dazed, and slightly confused.  Let me, like many others, set my stall out right here.  I am a massive Star Wars fan.  The brilliance is there for all to see.  I loved mainly the human aspect of the original trilogy, the emotion, the wit and the passion for what they believed in.  When The Phantom Menace was released, I was overjoyed with spectacle of the thing.  It created the scene for what was going to happen, in a distant kind of way.  Even the universally hated Jar Jar Binks couldn't stop me from really appreciating what this film was trying to achieve.  Still, as the months passed I lost interest in that film and started to see it's bad points too.When I heard that 'Attack Of The Clones' was receiving amazing reviews from all who had seen previews, I was very optimistic that Mr Lucas had ironed out all those little problems that plagued EP 1.How wrong I was...'Attack Of The Clones' for me, is WORSE than Phantom.  When I saw Phantom for the first time I left the cinema content.  When I left the cinema last night I was totally deflated, gutted.  The film just didn't flow.  It labored along.  It didn't excite, move or intrigue me.This is why AOTC fails for me...*********SPOILERS***********C3PO - I loved him in the original trilogy.  But why, oh why, oh why.  What the hell was he doing in the film at all?  It seems he was just there to make up the numbers.  He was there because he HAD to be there.  He had three AWFUL one liners, that made me wince.  Worse than any lame Saturday night club act.  He was CGI for most of the movie, that just doesn't work for him.  The scene where he falls off the ridge only to grab onto a moving platform was ridiculous.  It reminded me of a bad episode of the cartoon 'Droids'.  He cannot be that athletic, he's struggles to walk half the time.  Another scene that made me cringe was 'the swapping of heads' with the Battle droids.  This just reduced the whole end battle scene to a joke.  I felt myself looking around so I didn't have to watch it.  C3PO should have never been in this new trilogy, he's a joke now.YODA FIGHT SCENE - Yoda cannot move that quick, period.  He should have remained as a puppet, kept his ludicrously small sabre hidden and used other methods of fighting.  The whole battle with Dooku reminded me of something out of an Austin Powers film or even Spaceballs (I see your Shwartz is as big as mine...)  It just didn't fit his character.  He was just totally unconvincing as a martial arts expert.  And those faces he now pulls, oh dear oh dear.CGI BATTLE SCENE AT THE END OF THE MOVIE - To me, it was lifeless.  It felt like I was watching a brand new computer game trailer.  The use of Computer Generated Imagery was just so over the top, I felt nothing for the characters or the outcome.  The camera work was atrocious. It zoomed in and out like a episode of 'Captain Scarlet', never letting us focus on something before moving to another shot.  The Clone Troopers looked awful, hollow, never believable.  A real letdown this was. I was expecting more.THE SPACE-CHASE BETWEEN OBI-WAN AND SLAVE 1 - Is this the worst space sequence in Star Wars history?  The ships were slow, horribly computer generated, hardly breaking into a sweat 99% of the time.  There was no tension.  The little kid playing Boba Fett also grated on me in this scene.  Again, no conviction.  How did it end?  Can't remember...DOOKU v OBI WAN AND ANAKIN - If the lightsabre dual at the end of Star Wars A New Hope was the worst prior to this, then this runs it close.  Christopher Lee's head had been quite clearly 'stuck' onto a more able bodied actor for most of the battle, and when Lee was actually fighting, they kept the camera up close so we didn't see the speed at which they were moving.  Lame, very lame.So whats good about EPII?Let me say this.  Hayden Christensen is very believable as a messed up, Sith in waiting.  I particularly enjoyed his darker scenes.  The slaughter of the Tuskan Raiders could have been made much more powerful by showing what was evil about it, the killing of women and children. Though I understand why it wasn't shown.  His refusal to accept orders from his master also created a bit of tension at times.  Even the love story between himself and Padme was welcome relief, if a little cheesy.Ewan McGregor was good as Obi Wan.  Especially in lighter moments.  I can particularly remember his face when slaying the best towards the end as an highlight.But these moments were few and far between.  At a running time of over 2 hours, they could have chopped 30 minutes of this and made it a much better film.  First to go would have been the sequence when Anakin, Padme and the two droids are trying to get through the droid factory.  This whole thing was totally unnecessary, and added nothing to the story.  Also for the chop would be the stupid chase through the skys of corussant.  It's all been done before, and was just in there as a quick thrill and a chance for ILM to show off.To summarize then.  EPII is a below average film.  Low on highs, high on lows.  The CGI input as gotten out of control.  So much so that we no longer care for the characters. After all, we know that their enemies are not there, either in body or model, so why bother to get into it?  But I thank god that CGI was not around in 1980, or think of the mess they could have made of The Empire Strikes Back.  They have taken characters like Yoda, C3PO and R2D2 and made them the total opposite of everything we've believed for 20 years.  Given them super powers Lucas as.  It's stupid to change them now.

Let me, like many others, set my stall out right here.  I am a massive Star Wars fan.  The brilliance is there for all to see.  I loved mainly the human aspect of the original trilogy, the emotion, the wit and the passion for what they believed in.  When The Phantom Menace was released, I was overjoyed with spectacle of the thing.  It created the scene for what was going to happen, in a distant kind of way.  Even the universally hated Jar Jar Binks couldn't stop me from really appreciating what this film was trying to achieve.  Still, as the months passed I lost interest in that film and started to see it's bad points too.When I heard that 'Attack Of The Clones' was receiving amazing reviews from all who had seen previews, I was very optimistic that Mr Lucas had ironed out all those little problems that plagued EP 1.How wrong I was...'Attack Of The Clones' for me, is WORSE than Phantom.  When I saw Phantom for the first time I left the cinema content.  When I left the cinema last night I was totally deflated, gutted.  The film just didn't flow.  It labored along.  It didn't excite, move or intrigue me.This is why AOTC fails for me...*********SPOILERS***********C3PO - I loved him in the original trilogy.  But why, oh why, oh why.  What the hell was he doing in the film at all?  It seems he was just there to make up the numbers.  He was there because he HAD to be there.  He had three AWFUL one liners, that made me wince.  Worse than any lame Saturday night club act.  He was CGI for most of the movie, that just doesn't work for him.  The scene where he falls off the ridge only to grab onto a moving platform was ridiculous.  It reminded me of a bad episode of the cartoon 'Droids'.  He cannot be that athletic, he's struggles to walk half the time.  Another scene that made me cringe was 'the swapping of heads' with the Battle droids.  This just reduced the whole end battle scene to a joke.  I felt myself looking around so I didn't have to watch it.  C3PO should have never been in this new trilogy, he's a joke now.YODA FIGHT SCENE - Yoda cannot move that quick, period.  He should have remained as a puppet, kept his ludicrously small sabre hidden and used other methods of fighting.  The whole battle with Dooku reminded me of something out of an Austin Powers film or even Spaceballs (I see your Shwartz is as big as mine...)  It just didn't fit his character.  He was just totally unconvincing as a martial arts expert.  And those faces he now pulls, oh dear oh dear.CGI BATTLE SCENE AT THE END OF THE MOVIE - To me, it was lifeless.  It felt like I was watching a brand new computer game trailer.  The use of Computer Generated Imagery was just so over the top, I felt nothing for the characters or the outcome.  The camera work was atrocious. It zoomed in and out like a episode of 'Captain Scarlet', never letting us focus on something before moving to another shot.  The Clone Troopers looked awful, hollow, never believable.  A real letdown this was. I was expecting more.THE SPACE-CHASE BETWEEN OBI-WAN AND SLAVE 1 - Is this the worst space sequence in Star Wars history?  The ships were slow, horribly computer generated, hardly breaking into a sweat 99% of the time.  There was no tension.  The little kid playing Boba Fett also grated on me in this scene.  Again, no conviction.  How did it end?  Can't remember...DOOKU v OBI WAN AND ANAKIN - If the lightsabre dual at the end of Star Wars A New Hope was the worst prior to this, then this runs it close.  Christopher Lee's head had been quite clearly 'stuck' onto a more able bodied actor for most of the battle, and when Lee was actually fighting, they kept the camera up close so we didn't see the speed at which they were moving.  Lame, very lame.So whats good about EPII?Let me say this.  Hayden Christensen is very believable as a messed up, Sith in waiting.  I particularly enjoyed his darker scenes.  The slaughter of the Tuskan Raiders could have been made much more powerful by showing what was evil about it, the killing of women and children. Though I understand why it wasn't shown.  His refusal to accept orders from his master also created a bit of tension at times.  Even the love story between himself and Padme was welcome relief, if a little cheesy.Ewan McGregor was good as Obi Wan.  Especially in lighter moments.  I can particularly remember his face when slaying the best towards the end as an highlight.But these moments were few and far between.  At a running time of over 2 hours, they could have chopped 30 minutes of this and made it a much better film.  First to go would have been the sequence when Anakin, Padme and the two droids are trying to get through the droid factory.  This whole thing was totally unnecessary, and added nothing to the story.  Also for the chop would be the stupid chase through the skys of corussant.  It's all been done before, and was just in there as a quick thrill and a chance for ILM to show off.To summarize then.  EPII is a below average film.  Low on highs, high on lows.  The CGI input as gotten out of control.  So much so that we no longer care for the characters. After all, we know that their enemies are not there, either in body or model, so why bother to get into it?  But I thank god that CGI was not around in 1980, or think of the mess they could have made of The Empire Strikes Back.  They have taken characters like Yoda, C3PO and R2D2 and made them the total opposite of everything we've believed for 20 years.  Given them super powers Lucas as.  It's stupid to change them now. We knew their attributes, and we knew their failings....that's why we love (loved) them.Still, I will look forward to Episode III.

Despite some bad compositing of characters leaping on or off of CGI animals and such, and some (read all) painful romantic moments with Amidala and Anakin, and some action elements that seem to have been orchestrated to either immolate video games or inspire the expected Star Wars video games, despite those elements this thing is pure sugar, and I've no regrets dumping out the cash to see it opening day. Loved the improved characters, the massively improved loyalty to continuity with the first trio of films, the re-creation of Owen & Beru's crib on Tattoine, the Jawa spread, the inclusion of Boba's backstory (and I'm shocked I dug this one, but if you're going to do it right, do it fully over the top, and they did, all the clones are based on Jango Fett including li'l Boba, out of control). Found the similarities of the Tusken Raider camp to a Native American village a bit unnerving, and I'd love to know where the raiders got bamboo to tie up Anakin's mom on a desert planet. Loved the violence of the opening, uncanny and beautifully rendered. Loved the arena monsters, especially the crab thing. Loved the Jedi fight with the Federation droids (which no longer act nearly as boring as in Ep. 1, although the Roger Roger gag is used again, and yeh, I chuckled again). Loved that 3 or 4 of the surviving Jedi were female, and 2 of those were the clearly Asian women, and the others were Hindu and Green tentacle alien respectively (there may have been more, but these four need action figures IMMEDIATELY!). Didn't laugh at the C3PO one line gags This is a drag. Ow. I'm beside myself. Double ow. Mixed feelings about R2-D2's leg thrusters. Found seeing R2-D2 use his third leg to climb stairs a bit distracting (although I've had to do that a few times, so I can empathize with the little guy). Loved Yoda doing the Jet Li action. Loved seeing Anakin getting his arm lopped off. Why stop there, I wondered? Loved like a mother the city stuff, the vehicles, the centipedes, the high speed traffic, the seedy bar, the scantly clad alien babes, the diner with the femme waitress bot. Awesome!

Love the alien world where the clones are being produced, and dig the aliens doing the producing. Love the whole business with Jango's rapid firing machine in the asteroid belt. Love the leader of the bugs, love the Techno cyborg guy in the Federation camp even more. Kit Fisto is also the bomb, by the way.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"17 May 2002","score":"","review":"  Yep, I saw Ep2 last night and to save you the suspense it sucks! At least I think that would be the opinion of any frequent cinema go-er. In short this film is a combination of VERY bad screenplay, good-ok story, impressive but boring at times computer graphics, a very cheesy love story and bad use of good actors.Let me start with the love story. Lots of people have blamed Lucas for this love story, but he defended him self by saying that it was always part of the story. I have to admit that he is right about this, BUT that does not mean he has to give it so much weight (why no do it like Leia-Solo??), or put stupid lines witch many times made everyone in the cinema laugh (by the way MUCH worse than Gone With The Wind)!Now, concerning the graphics which go together with direction, both are a vast improvement from Ep1, but, some times the graphics are too much. I mean, why do rooms in CG, it DOES NOT LOOK REAL!!!!! Also, concerning the direction it is still not impressive al all. I mean Lucas has to grow up some time. All the shots are typical of any mediocre action film. I mean, sure this was ok in the late 70s\/ early 80's but nowadays action films shooting is much more sophisticated, take for example The Matrix and of course Lord Of The Rings! In both these films cinematography is GREAT!Now, I have to admit that the story is not bad, in fact at some points it's quite good(don't want to spoil anything here)! However, no matter how god a story is, it looks really bad and boring when combined with stupid, repetitive dialog. This is not just the love scenes, it's everything. For example the Obi-Ani relationship, how many time have we heard such lines before my master underestimate me, he is jealous of me, I'm better than him, I'm going to be the best, yada,yada,yada! I think that Lucas(and whoever else was responsible) should just STOP WRITING THE SCREENPLAY!!!!Bad directing is also seen when good actors look like they're acting bad. All the stars her are very good to excellent in other films, can't Lucas be bothered to shoot something twice to get it right??My conclusion is that this could not have been worse than Ep1 since we don't get to see Jar-Jar that often. But also, from both Ep1, Ep2 I think that the greatness of the first trilogy is owed to anyone but Lucas. Now that he is more involved the films suck.

These are the best words to describe how I felt watching Attack of the Clones.George Lucas has said that all a movie needs is a good opening 5 minutes and a great last 20.  The rest is filler.  Great if you've got a 25 minute short, not so good for a 2 hour plus feature.  I'd heard there was meant to be great light-sabre battles etc but it soon became clear that George was holding these back for the final reel in a desperate effort to stop people walking out.  Even when these much talked of duels did eventuate they weren't up to much chop.  Yoda wouldn't stand a chance against Jackie Chan.As it's a prequel we all know how it's going to end.  Annakin has to at least begin to turn to the dark side.  Now what's going to make him do that? Something pretty dramatic in a young fella's life.  I know thinks George lets knock off his Ma.  She's not doing anyone any good just sitting around as a slave on Tatooine.  So Mama Skywalker is soon worm food or at least the Tatooine equivalent.  This sequence felt completely contrived as an excuse for Annakin to start to turn to the dark side.  It always rankled with me that the Jedi are zooming around the universe standing for truth, justice and the Republic's way and yet they quite happily let the mother of one of their own remain a slave.  At the very least where were Annakin's feelings towards his mother once he was old enough to do something about it himself?Forget his Ma, my own theory on why the future Darth Vader goes bad is because he's been called Annie one time too many.  He even becomes little orphan Annie by the end of the film.  Imagine what people call him who really hate him?  His ears must have turned blue hearing the songs sung by the crowd when he entered the Gladiator rip off arena.My real issue with this though is that here was the supposed life altering moment.  Annakin's Ma is dead and he's p***ed.  How do we know? Well he tells us that he's wasted a village of tuscan raiders. And just to show he's an equal rights killer he tells us he killed the women and kids too. What's wrong with this?  Movies are meant to be show not tell.  Why not let us see him unleash the fury?  That way we'd be more convinced he's as bad as 3 month old milk (and get to see a little more sabre action).  Instead we only see him knock off a couple of guards before cutting to the next scene.  No biggee.  My grandmother knocks off a dozen evil henchmen on her way to church every Sunday.  Oh that's right it's a PG rated movie.  Women and kids being wasted by the hero has gotta bump up the rating and cut down the audience.  And lets face it George isn't quite as rich as Bill Gates or God...yet.  (He would be if he actually made a good Star Wars prequel).So Annakin's gone through his magical moment and is supposedly on the down hill slide.  You'd think this would be reinforced somehow by some subsequent action.  For example, blatantly defying Obi Wan and jumping off a speeding transport to check on the woman to whom he's declared his love.  But no.And that's the crux of the problem, no character development. Annakin starts as a truculent youngster, his Mom dies so he wastes a few women and children (hey we've all got our faults), but then he goes back to being a truculent, impetuous teen.  Yes Obi-Wan, no Obi-Wan, sorry Obi-Wan.At the next election what ever you do don't vote Amidala.  This girl has some serious judgement issues.  Going out with Annakin when he's a nice Jedi is a no-no, but marrying him a day or so after he's wiped out a village and his mother bit the big one is okey-dokey.

But it is, this is not only better than The Phantom Menace and Return of the Jedi, but it's better than both A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. Let me explain the reasons why.The acting. I don't know what people mean when they say Natalie Portman is wooden as Padme Amidala, she's obviously been raised to be a politician from birth, which is why she talks like one. Her 'we live in a real world' line did not strike me as bad writing, but as something a person like her would say at a time like that. Ewan McGregor was Obi-Wan Kenobi to bone, brilliantly walking the fine line between imitating Alec Guinness and still remaining ín actual character, not content to being a copy of another actor's work. And Hayden Christensen was nothing short of brilliant, again, what some people have called bad lines, I consider things that I would say if I as him. And the frustration, both with Obi-Wan and his fate as a Jedi Padawan, slowly growing, and then the rage at his mother's death and his inability to stop it. He acted like any good man would act in the situtations that he faced. And he WAS Darth Vader for a while there. And Yoda... I consider Yoda the first completely believable CGI character ever. I of course knew that Yoda was CGI in this movie, but I forgot about it after the first scene with him in it. He was more alive than he's ever been before, which I credit to the combined work of the animation team and Frank Oz, who I can now honestly call an actor - he invented the way Yoda moved and acted, and if he ever seemed fake in the original trilogy, it was due to the limitations in presenting a rubber puppet on screen. So, in all, character-wise, this movie had my two favourites Darth Vader and Yoda. And it lacked ANY annoying sidekicks, no Jar Jars or Chewbaccas here (yes, I never liked the furry guy, I've always found his wookiee yelping at inopportune situations and general incompetent behaviour almost as annoying as Jar Jar's), no hammy actor Luke Skywalker here, no Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford looking like they don't really want to be there. Just what made the original Star Wars great - high adventure, amazing action scenes and a truly epic tale of never-before-seen proportions.And then there's the way this movie looks. The special effects are the most incredible ever made, actually, there's hardly a scene in the movie that doesn't have some CGI in it, but it hardly ever feels like CGI anymore, 95 per cent of the time my disbelief was suspended and I felt like I was looking at a real world, in all its epic Star Wars glory. The direction and pacing were excellent, unlike in TPM, and the fights and action were brilliantly executed, but it never seemed to be 'hey, look, now it's an action scene'. Everything was there to tell the story. Lucas says he's a storyteller first and foremost. I agree, but I also have to add 'artist' to that. This movie went straight to my top 5 of all time (in the company of Fight Club, LOTR, Requiem For a Dream and Aliens), and I can't imagine how great Episode III will be.

An insult to those who actually lived through the real thing, on both sides of the Atlantic.Those overseas members who commented on how this movie is made for the cheese-eating American public are absolutely right.  This movie wasn't about anything that happened in 1776, it was about how can we make Mel Gibson everyone's favorite character if he were say, an 18th century plantation owner who really cares about his slaves and has kids with perfectly white teeth?I saw this flick with my dad.  We went thinking it would be a serious fact-based docu-drama.  We spent most of the movie laughing and guessing the dialogue before it was spoken and guessing what would happen before it happened.  The movie was made for the idiot American public who buys into garbage no matter whether it is accurate or not, just as long as it's cutesy.Why should there be anything funny in this tale of suffering and sacrifice?  But no, Hollywood has Mel walking out of the British encampment, whistling so the British officer's dogs come running, away from their master the evil British officer because they'd rather be with righteous Mel.

His two kids did a good job acting and being believable as scared children witnessing bloodshed and having no choice but to kill as well.

It has a couple of low-points but they do not detract from the film nearly as much as everyone is saying. Mainly, it rocks in an Empire Strikes Back kind of way. Any true Star Wars fan will love it. And when I say any true Star Wars fan, I am not talking about the little kids who liked The Phantom Menace? I am talking about the people who have all the bad dialogue from episodes 4-6 memorized and are really happy about it. I am talking about the people who own the limited edition 1978 Boba Fett action figure. But most importantly, I am talking about the people that love Star Wars because it's truly a great story.So let me briefly sum up what all the poop-on-my-party reviewers are saying about this movie they are saying that the screenplay is cheesy. DUH! Did you see ANY of the other movies in this series? Or did you block out Luke's whining and C-3PO's prissy one-liners? Star Wars movies are not indie films. They do not have brilliant acting performances or Tom Stoppard writing the dialogue. They are archetypal tales of good vs. evil. They are about high-action battles and awe-inspiring special effects. They are about a time long ago in a galaxy far far away- so cool your jets and have a little fun or I'm going to turn to the dark side and use the force against you.Let me start off the praise portion of this review by saying that Attack of the Clones contains some of the best CGI animation I have ever seen. I am pretty picky about this stuff, but I can honestly say that not one thing looked lame or cartoonish. It was just perfect. Yoda is completely CGI, and yet he is still the Yoda you know and love. In fact, seeing the Jedi master whip out his lightsaber is one of the highlights of the whole action-packed escapade. He is better than ever. Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson are both super-cool as Yoda's right-hand-men, fighting the forces of darkness with style, grace and aplomb (nice word, huh)? Hayden Christensen is cast rather perfectly in the role of the teenage Anakin. In his performance, hints of Darth Vader's cruelty and echoes of Luke's whiny it's just not fair attitude shine through with equal ease - and they come to the surface in a way that feels quite earnest.The plot is infinitely more engaging than The Phantom Menace, complete with lots of hand-to-hand combat, undercover investigations, intrigue over who is going to the dark side, and the ever looming question who is really controlling the Senate? Considering everything we already know (having seen the future in Episodes 4-6), Attack of the Clones does an incredible job of keeping us on our toes while also doing some major setup work in preparation for Episode III- which has all the potential to be the best film of all.All that said, even I have to concede that the love story between Padme and Anakin leaves a little something to be desired. Aside from the fact that she is in his soul, consuming him, you have to wonder what a woman like Senator Amidala sees in the hotheaded Jedi apprentice. Sure, he's got the skills that pay the bills, but even if they don't have statutory rape laws in the Republic, it's a pretty risque romance. Granted, we all love a bad boy now and then, but usually not one we used to baby-sit. But I came to terms with it as it evolved into something believable during the last hour of the film.I'm going to stop here so as not to give anything away. But I will say that this movie is less for the masses and more for the people who are obsessed with the whole story. So although I am jumping up and down and doing the dance of joy, I do admit that I own a toy light saber (it makes the coolest noises) as well as a plethora of additional Star Wars paraphernalia such as an R2-D2 crazy straw that I just can't seem to part with. It might be a little sick, but I really couldn't care less. If you have never been bitten by the SWB (Star Wars Bug), you may not be as excited as I am. So go see Spider-Man instead, but don't ask me to respect you in the morning.
