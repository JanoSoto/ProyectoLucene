The poor audience has to endure director Christpher Nolan's hyper-style version of the effect sleeplessness has on the most attention sensitive of minds.That's right, Pacino is the cop of cops in this boring and a sadly typical cop movie. But its not the buddy-cop version, that would be too much just one month after Showtime!. Instead of a mismatched partner, Pacino has one he genuinely likes as a person, which means he won't live that long, and he doesn't. Insomnia's twist is Pacino shoots him, and lies about it.See, the two of them are called from LA (where all good cops come from . . . or . . . wait . . . ) when a seventeen year old is brutally murdered and naturally, the local police are baffled because no one ever kills anyone in Alaska. While on a stakeout, Pacino runs after the killer (an effectively creepy and all too convincing Robin Williams) through fog that appears out of no where thats so thick poor Al can't see three feet, and the second he sees anything moving, BAM! Direct Hit! And wouldn't you know the luck? Robin Williams sees everything.And if you had just beaten a high school to death AND starred Bi-Centennial Man, you'd try to get away with it, too. So he blackmails Pacino, convincing him to help pin the murder on the girl's boyfriend; most of those silly Alaskan cops think he did it anyway. And Williams is incredibly effective as the soft-spoken and rational Walter Finch, who writes novels when he's not killing people or seducing jailbait. He's always calm, and he knows Pacino too well, probably because he writes about cliche detective work that Pacino is given to work with.But there are nice touches. The first few scenes show blood falling on a cuff, and someone vigorously trying to remove those tiny spots. Throughout the film we're treated to super-duper close-ups of that blood soaking into the fabic and staining it; as are those same stains on our characters and consciences when we've comprosmised morality. My gripe with Insomnia is that here we have ANOTHER cop movie about cop morals (Los Angelas cop morals, to boot!) and the line between right and wrong.Don't other people in our great and diverse society question their morals who AREN'T cops and attorneys?

Ed Norton's directorial debut examines this in what could be a serious movie but is a very funny romantic movie. \tWe start with Father Brian Finn, Ed Norton, stumbling drunk and landing in an all night bar. He ends up telling the story to a world-weary bartender who claims to have heard it all. The bartender knew he had heard it all when it started with, `There's this Priest and a Rabbi&#133;' Actually the story doesn't start there though. \tApproximately 16 years early Brian Finn and Jacob Schram, two best friends, met their soul mate Anna Riley.

The three friends begin palling around again and getting to know everything about them. Anna is basically the proto-typical 2000 woman. She is so busy working that she rarely has time to go out with men in fact as she puts it, she has a relationship with her phone. Anna is more interested in getting to know about the two guys.

This wouldn't be too much of a problem if Jake was just your normal attendee of the Synagogue however being a Rabbi up for his own church?

I suppose, deep down, I still am, though I hated what they ended up doing to the comics (the clones) and that's when I stopped reading. So, it's fair to say that I was extremely excited about this and that my inner twelve-year-old had been waiting his whole life to see it.So. From the perspective of a serious fan, and one with absurdly high expectations, I absolutely loved it. They got everything right - cast, effects, plot, atmosphere. *Everything*. Furthermore, I think the changes they made (organic web-shooters, Green Goblin's costume) were the right decisions to make, since the original Goblin costume would have looked utterly ridiculous and been impossible to get right.More good news - the original theme tune from the 1970s cartoon features on the end credits. It's worth sticking around for - I had a ridiculously silly grin plastered on my face afterwards.Basically, the plot takes perhaps the two most famous Spiderman stories (his origin and The Death of Gwen Stacey) and mixes them together, only with an appropriate time period between them, allowing Peter to both graduate from high school and move to New York.POSSIBLE SPOILERS*Comic geek alert! - Feel free to skip this bit.*(In the original comics, the most famous story involves the Green Goblin discovering Peter's secret identity and then using his gorgeous blonde girlfriend Gwen Stacey to get at him. He throws her off the Brooklyn Bridge, Spiderman catches her with a web-line but the fall breaks her neck anyway. Spiderman is furious with rage and almost kills the Goblin, who is then killed by a trap he has set for Spiderman. In the comics, it's only after Gwen has died that Peter eventually gets together with Mary-Jane. Anyway, the film substitutes Mary-Jane for Gwen for obvious reasons, but there are a lot of similarities otherwise, which will be a real treat if you ever read those comics).DEFINITE SPOILERSAs I said, the best thing about this is that they get everything right. All the familiar characters are there, including Flash Thompson and Harry Osborn (James Franco from Freaks & Geeks!). There are also appearances from un-named characters such as Betty Brant and Robbie Robertson - more treats for fans, I suspect. There's even a name-check for 'Dr. Connors' (aka The Lizard), who'd be a good bet for one of the sequels, as Spiderman's best foes always have some sort of close connection to him.The set-pieces are terrific. They include Peter discovering his Spidey-powers (no 'wakes up having 'webbed' himself scene, sadly); beating up Flash Thompson ( Yeah! ); the wrestling match (The Human Spider!); chasing the thief; the first attack by the Goblin; the frankly jaw-dropping bridge sequence and the -as promised- extremely violent fight at the end. (It's very very violent for a 12 - yet another example of them not copping out).Raimi was the perfect choice for this - it's comic-book-ish but in the way it should be. It never takes itself too seriously, but it never dumbs it down or winks at the audience either. And, it has to be said, the effects that count (web-shooting, web-swinging, wall-crawling) are amazing. Okay, so some of the CGI Goblin stuff is a bit disappointing and some of the 'jumping' scenes are over-CGI'd (if that's a phrase) but overall it works beautifully. Raimi also pulls off some excellent 'shock-moments' that work really well.The cast are terrific. Maguire is perfect, as is Dunst. And that rain scene...wow. When it started raining, the men in the audience all suddenly sat up to pay close attention. Let's just say, this movie will be HUGE on DVD...Minor criticisms? Well, for one, J.Jonah Jameson isn't in it enough. He's fabulous in the scenes he's in, but then pretty much disappears. Hopefully they'll do the Scorpion in the future and then he'll have a bigger part. Secondly, as much as I loved Danny Elfman's score, it wasn't memorable in the way that his Batman score was - I'd forgotten it before I even got out of the cinema. Thirdly, it's not quite as funny as it should be (particularly in terms of Spiderman's trademark wise-cracks), though there's lots of humour in the first half. Having said that, though, given the tone of the second half, it was probably the right decision. Anyway, these are really minor criticisms, given the film overall.One more thing. The ending doesn't cop out and is decidedly unexpected, but definitely the right decision. Congratulations to whoever fought (and won) that particular battle.(Incidentally, see it in the best sound-equipped cinema possible - the sound in one scene in particular was amazing).SPOILERS ENDSo, in short, the effects are spectacular , the cast is amazing , it's extremely dark in tone and it doesn't cop out at the end. I'm unashamedly putting this straight into my Top Ten of the Year.Having said all that, I feel duty-bound to confess that not that many other people seemed to like it - I heard a lot of disappointed opinions on the way out of the cinema. So...it definitely won't be for everyone. But I bloody loved it. So there.

They include Peter discovering his Spidey-powers (no 'wakes up having 'webbed' himself scene, sadly); beating up Flash Thompson ( Yeah! ); the wrestling match (The Human Spider!); chasing the thief; the first attack by the Goblin; the frankly jaw-dropping bridge sequence and the -as promised- extremely violent fight at the end. (It's very very violent for a 12 - yet another example of them not copping out).Raimi was the perfect choice for this - it's comic-book-ish but in the way it should be. It never takes itself too seriously, but it never dumbs it down or winks at the audience either. And, it has to be said, the effects that count (web-shooting, web-swinging, wall-crawling) are amazing. Okay, so some of the CGI Goblin stuff is a bit disappointing and some of the 'jumping' scenes are over-CGI'd (if that's a phrase) but overall it works beautifully. Raimi also pulls off some excellent 'shock-moments' that work really well.The cast are terrific. Maguire is perfect, as is Dunst. And that rain scene...wow. When it started raining, the men in the audience all suddenly sat up to pay close attention. Let's just say, this movie will be HUGE on DVD...Minor criticisms? Well, for one, J.Jonah Jameson isn't in it enough. He's fabulous in the scenes he's in, but then pretty much disappears. Hopefully they'll do the Scorpion in the future and then he'll have a bigger part. Secondly, as much as I loved Danny Elfman's score, it wasn't memorable in the way that his Batman score was - I'd forgotten it before I even got out of the cinema. Thirdly, it's not quite as funny as it should be (particularly in terms of Spiderman's trademark wise-cracks), though there's lots of humour in the first half. Having said that, though, given the tone of the second half, it was probably the right decision. Anyway, these are really minor criticisms, given the film overall.One more thing. The ending doesn't cop out and is decidedly unexpected, but definitely the right decision. Congratulations to whoever fought (and won) that particular battle.(Incidentally, see it in the best sound-equipped cinema possible - the sound in one scene in particular was amazing).SPOILERS ENDSo, in short, the effects are spectacular , the cast is amazing , it's extremely dark in tone and it doesn't cop out at the end. I'm unashamedly putting this straight into my Top Ten of the Year.Having said all that, I feel duty-bound to confess that not that many other people seemed to like it - I heard a lot of disappointed opinions on the way out of the cinema. So...it definitely won't be for everyone. But I bloody loved it. So there.  ","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"1 May 2002","score":"","review":"    ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** First of all, I suppose I ought to say that from the age of about ten until around six years ago when I finally stopped reading the comics, I was a huge Spider-man fan. I suppose, deep down, I still am, though I hated what they ended up doing to the comics (the clones) and that's when I stopped reading. So, it's fair to say that I was extremely excited about this and that my inner twelve-year-old had been waiting his whole life to see it.So. From the perspective of a serious fan, and one with absurdly high expectations, I absolutely loved it. They got everything right - cast, effects, plot, atmosphere. *Everything*. Furthermore, I think the changes they made (organic web-shooters, Green Goblin's costume) were the right decisions to make, since the original Goblin costume would have looked utterly ridiculous and been impossible to get right.More good news - the original theme tune from the 1970s cartoon features on the end credits. It's worth sticking around for - I had a ridiculously silly grin plastered on my face afterwards.Basically, the plot takes perhaps the two most famous Spiderman stories (his origin and The Death of Gwen Stacey) and mixes them together, only with an appropriate time period between them, allowing Peter to both graduate from high school and move to New York.POSSIBLE SPOILERS*Comic geek alert! - Feel free to skip this bit.*(In the original comics, the most famous story involves the Green Goblin discovering Peter's secret identity and then using his gorgeous blonde girlfriend Gwen Stacey to get at him. He throws her off the Brooklyn Bridge, Spiderman catches her with a web-line but the fall breaks her neck anyway. Spiderman is furious with rage and almost kills the Goblin, who is then killed by a trap he has set for Spiderman. In the comics, it's only after Gwen has died that Peter eventually gets together with Mary-Jane. Anyway, the film substitutes Mary-Jane for Gwen for obvious reasons, but there are a lot of similarities otherwise, which will be a real treat if you ever read those comics).DEFINITE SPOILERSAs I said, the best thing about this is that they get everything right. All the familiar characters are there, including Flash Thompson and Harry Osborn (James Franco from Freaks & Geeks!). There are also appearances from un-named characters such as Betty Brant and Robbie Robertson - more treats for fans, I suspect.

I am very critical of comic book movies since I am a huge fan of the medium and was tremendously disappointed in the Superman and Batman movies (all of them, some greatly!). This film however has again demonstrated that an adaptation of a comic book story can be  fun and faithful to the story, yet be a film for all ages and those who may not have ever even read a comic book.  The Crow was the only other good comic book movie in my opinion, but it was not an all ages fun ride as this is!I had the privilege of seeing the film last night, 4-30-02, in SF with the press and 300+ other folks for its Bay Area Premiere.The acting is the finest portion of the film with the leads giving us depth that I was unsure would be allowed by the style of story chosen.  Maguire was outstanding at being a guy who can rarely catch a break, but attract difficulty with ease and aplomb.  He is awkward with the woman he loves, but eloquent when dealing with the familiar, just as most teenagers are even today.  He gave us wonderful joy at the prospect of web swinging and kicking some much deserved ass!  Dafoe is wonderfully scary as the man who has succumbed to the power games of the corporate  world that drives a decent man mad striving for perfection in himself while trying to hard to please all the wrong people to no avail and then being consumed by guilt that has built over the years of family neglect which finally helps to push him over the edge when an opportunity to make a huge mistake presents itself.The rest of cast is nearly as spectacular with the J.K. Simmons turning in the best performance in the film as J. Jonah Jamason.  When he appeared on screen things lite up even more and he was on fire making everyone in the audience laugh and myself nearly p** my pants.  Harris as Aunt May and Robertson as Uncle Ben were excellent choices and gave the film a great deal of its credibility and finesse.  Letting what happens to Ben and Peter (I am not telling) was wonderful and the best punctuation to what makes Peter do what he does and brings complete credibility to the story.   I am not a huge Dunst fan, but she was just fine as the love of Peter Parker's life and a person much like Peter only neither was conscious of the fact.  This to me is a more real version of  true love.The script was far stronger than I expected with some wonderful dialog; verbal exchanges, solid plot points and pacing.  Many a good parenting lesson can be found in this film as well as interesting thoughts about the choices that we make in life that we might think are no big deal when in the heat of passion, but may well come back to haunt us if we don't think before we act\/speak which is the trust of the film in my humble opinion.The direction from Raimi was also much better than I anticipated coming from someone who is known (and loved) for his over the top camp and action.  Many of the fight and action sequences where more over done than I like, but they were solid and much like a comic of the Silver Age from whence the story comes so it fit the film fine.  Nice cinematography without the CGI taking over and detracting from the realism, in fact it made much of the web swinging truly believable.  A few points made things a bit hard to believe, but over all I think most folks will be able to suspend their disbelief.Danny Elfman.  Need I say more?

","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"1 May 2002","score":"","review":"  Sitting through a short part of this film, I knew that this had to be one of the worst films of all time. One thing that bugs me is the continuity gap. Okay, so the series has not been exactly great in this faction, but the last time we saw Jason, he was being physically pulled into Hell (by the way, wasn't the title of that film Jason Goes to Hell The FINAL Friday? I suppose that it was only in reference to the series' title and not the franchise itself). Well, we have to assume that this film exists in an alternative timeline because the film makes no reference to how the film's un-killable butcher is back now. The film starts in a not-too distant future where Jason has been captured and awaits some sort of sentence. The film is also unclear on how they managed to contain someone who has breathed in more bullets then a shooting range. Are we to assume that they triumphed where the Squat team from Jason Goes To Hell failed in blowing him away? The film clearly exits outside of how the rest of the series sets itself up. Either that or I believe that whomever wrote this film has never actually seen one of the Friday films; they just know enough that he is Jason Voorhees and that he kills kids who practice the prescription of drugs, alcohol and sex. The film is really a bad blend of the following the self-conscious remarks of the characters from Scream, but minus the humour, wit and irony; every sloppy sci-fi film, especially Aliens; a bit of the Terminator films; the film also manages to rip itself off, there is a scene that recalls the sexual relationship between student and professor from VII Jason takes Manhattan, as well as an updated version of the paintball game in part VI. Now if you can ignore all that, there is the fact that the dialog is lamer then anything I have heard. There is no plot (obviously), but the main point is that the film really p****d on a good concept and did just the same thing here and there. That Leprechaun in Space movie worked better then this. There is something about the depths of space that can turn any horror franchise into some of the most laughable pieces in cinema history. But mainly in this film (more so then in the Leprechaun film... a series that never really worked anyway in my opinion), the characters are twice as big as idiots. For a film using ideas such as cryogenics and a futuristic\/outer space setting, nothing is really being done differently. The killings are boring with the exception of only one, which contains a freeze-dryer but even that doesn't escape predictability. The film tries to be funnier then the previous films and that means a lot of jokes, but only two are worth mentioning (hint one is the adverts). Everything else, well, imagine every dumb thing kids did in the previous installments, then add some futuristic touches and you get the point.

From the rumours I had heard, it sounded like she was a key figure to the story, possibly even holding a secret to Jason, like how to destroy him. I was wrong.

At least if she were, it would make the film a lot more interesting. Maybe I should not overanalyze what is obviously a dumb film, but even dumb films work better then this. I have seen every film in the series and this is by far the worse. At least those films were acting out in an organic response to some characters and situations at times. The ending to this little forgettable romp is a bit unique, even interesting I have to admit, but only given the film's setting. It was a bit redemptive seeing as how it was about the only thing I remember. Actually, there is an interesting scene where Jason is in a hologram of Crystal Lake, but neither the taste of the joke and the scene itself last long enough to tide. However, all the little bits of simplistic mystique and guilty-pleasure back story from the rest of the films have been erased and leaves you not wanting more, but instead, wondering as to why they didn't makes you want more.

The only thing that makes me want to go see this again is the music playing in the end credits. I'm contemplating as to whether it's worth sitting through all that rubbish again just to listen to what I found to be a refreshing slasher score. But if there is one thing this installment teaches you, it's that no matter how far we advance in civilization with technology in the centuries to come, people will continue to behave asinine and take stupid actions when masked serial killers are on the loose.

One thing that bugs me is the continuity gap. Okay, so the series has not been exactly great in this faction, but the last time we saw Jason, he was being physically pulled into Hell (by the way, wasn't the title of that film Jason Goes to Hell The FINAL Friday? I suppose that it was only in reference to the series' title and not the franchise itself). Well, we have to assume that this film exists in an alternative timeline because the film makes no reference to how the film's un-killable butcher is back now. The film starts in a not-too distant future where Jason has been captured and awaits some sort of sentence. The film is also unclear on how they managed to contain someone who has breathed in more bullets then a shooting range. Are we to assume that they triumphed where the Squat team from Jason Goes To Hell failed in blowing him away? The film clearly exits outside of how the rest of the series sets itself up. Either that or I believe that whomever wrote this film has never actually seen one of the Friday films; they just know enough that he is Jason Voorhees and that he kills kids who practice the prescription of drugs, alcohol and sex. The film is really a bad blend of the following the self-conscious remarks of the characters from Scream, but minus the humour, wit and irony; every sloppy sci-fi film, especially Aliens; a bit of the Terminator films; the film also manages to rip itself off, there is a scene that recalls the sexual relationship between student and professor from VII Jason takes Manhattan, as well as an updated version of the paintball game in part VI. Now if you can ignore all that, there is the fact that the dialog is lamer then anything I have heard. There is no plot (obviously), but the main point is that the film really p****d on a good concept and did just the same thing here and there. That Leprechaun in Space movie worked better then this.

While Pacino never appeared with Brando again, de Niro gets to be paired with the old master of Method in The Score, a slightly lethargic but exciting heist caper.

I was excited, of course.In addition to these casts, we have Edward Norton, a hotshot young actor, and since this is a genre film, everybody is more or less just enjoying himself or herself. Of course, I have got to mention this; Brando had problem with the director Frank Oz, and wanted de Niro to direct all his scenes. This news is debatable, and personally I don't care. Scenes with and without Brando worked very well. Heist movies have mostly worked, and I believe The Score should be listed as one of the classics, simply for the last forty minutes when the actual heist takes place. There, remains the problem. It takes time to develop its story, introduce the character and build the suspense. The latter is not realised until the final part and fans of action may be disappointed with it. I sat through the whole thing mainly for its actor. The most amazing thing about this movie is the fact that the plot depends entirely on old worn-out cliché of heist flicks &#150; the hero retiring, wants out and pulling off the final score. The story is built around it and gave ways to twist and turn. You might have seen some of them, but Frank Oz and the cast manage to keep us from cringing. I cannot take my eyes of Brando and de Niro. Those two guys defined and redefined acting for Hollywood, and probably anywhere else. Both have gone to the extend very few have gone and many have imitated. Here, both are relaxed, and mostly, enjoying themselves. Only of recent, both of them have involved themselves in commercial genre films, considering that in the past, most of what they did were award material.

A film that contained a thoughtful and mature treatment of even one of the above elements would make it a good film. That Y Tu Mama Tambien does justice to all of them makes it a truly outstanding film, perhaps the best film to come out of Mexico in quite a while.The film features two boys about 17 years old, Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal, from another great Mexican film Amores Perros). They are best of friends, even though Tenoch comes from a rich, upper class family and Julio comes from a family that can barely be considered as middle class. And as typical of many boys their age (irrespective of nationality), they are directionless and, above all, extremely horny. Their girlfriends leave for Italy on a vacation and at a party thrown by Tenoch's father (who's a respectable politician), the boys meet a sexy and older distant cousin of Tenoch, Luisa (Maribel Verdu). During their flirtatious conversation with Luisa they suggest that she should come with them and get away to a magical beach called Heaven's Mouth (which they made up just to flirt and make conversation with her). Some time afterwards, Luisa calls the boys and asks them if the invitation is still open. They say Yes. And after borrowing a car from Julio's sister for five days, the three are off on a roadtrip to find Heaven's Mouth.I will not reveal any more of the plot here, since this film contains some big surprises, particularly concerning the reason why Luisa decides to go with the boys to that made-up beach (which she believes is real). Suffice it to say that along their journey Luisa ends up teaching the boys about sex, love, and life--in short, the boys' journey to Heaven's Mouth is at the same time their journey towards maturity and manhood.You've probably heard about the pretty explicit sexual content of this film and might have been either (i) Dissuaded from seeing it, or (ii) since you like smutty and gratuitous sex in movies, you plan on seeing it. If you belong in the latter category, I can say that your expectations will be sorely disappointed. The sex scenes in Y Tu Mama Tambien are not gratuitous, nor are they smutty and puerile; rather, they're open and honest, thoughtful and mature. If you're looking for smut, look elsewhere. If you belong in the former category, I can say that you might very well be pleasantly surprised surprised about this film's frankness about sex, yes, but even more surprised about its warmth and humanity.In the end, Y Tu Mama Tambien is a film filled more with sadness--and the sober reminder of the mortality of us all--than sex. It is one of those great films that start out making you snicker and laugh (e.g. about its humor and sexuality, of which there are plenty), only to sneak up on you and shatter you emotionally by its (deadly serious) end. Although the aesthetically incompetent folks at the MPAA didn't give this film a rating, I will give it one four stars. Y Tu Mama Tambien is one of the must see films of this year--or any year.

Can he find the evidence & stop the wrongful execution in time!Clint Eastwood is not only an acting icon but  a very good director from Play Misty For Me to the multi-Oscar winning Unforgiven. True Crime however is a blot on a career which has for the most part been of a consistently high & entertaining quality.The problem with True Crime is that it comes across as a TV movie or at best a 50s B-movie. The characters are cliched from the washed up reporter to the Newspaper Boss with a grudge & everything has been seen before, better done. Who do we blame for the films faults? The script  doesn't thrill or excite & the whole film is a mass of contradictions which is not helped by uninspiring direction & by the numbers acting. Is it an anti-death penalty movie, a light thriller or a comment on the treatment of ethnic minorities by the legal system of America? I doubt if anyone involved in this film knows. For example, more could have been made of the Prison Governor, who in one small scene hints at his doubts as to his prisoners crime. This idea could have been expanded - a man whos job it is to incarcarate questioning the guilt of those he must punish.The finale of True Crime has to be one of the most unintentionally  hilarious in cinema history & anyone who has seen The Player will find it laughingly familiar. Also the way in which we get to it is quite uninspiring, no mass of clues coverups & false evidence here just a total change of heart by one of the characters in the space of a couple of seconds! No in-depth detective work from Mr Eastwood apart from a quick interview with a witness, a stack of crisps & a lucky break involving a piece of evidence all of which surely must have come up during the trial.Overall this is a totally pointless film which neither thrills when it should or pulls at the heartstrings at the right moments.

While there, he reunites with an old friend, Wang Chi, who, consequently, is getting married in a few days.  Unfortunately, Lo Pan, an ancient Chinese demon\/sorcerer\/businessman has his sights set on the same women because only a green-eyed girl can restore his mortality.  Eventually, Jack and Wang go on an adventure to rescue a whole bevy of women with green eyes and stop Lo Pan before he can rule the universe.The best elements of Big Trouble in Little China are the characters and the situations that develop between them.  The Three Storms are defintely a great addition to the movie, and the intense fight sequences were ahead of their time.  The big final fight between the good and bad gangs is hilarious, exciting, and special-effects laden including a sort of magical game of Mortal Kombat; a man kicking another man 3 times in row (very quickly); Wang and Rain sword fighting in *mid-air*; and Jack Burton displaying his amazing throwing arm (It's all in the reflexes).Oh, and Kurt Russel's portrayal of Jack Burton is timeless and very funny.

The hero knows he's in danger, yet sits around waiting to be gagged and tied; he doesn't turn his head to see the villain sneaking up behind him, as a normal person would do ... and all the while, Mortimer is doing exactly the same thing, as a villain sneaks up on him in exactly the same way.  His bellyaching monologue even provides the villain with a useful idea.The scene was obviously crafted for the stage.  And yet, if Capra had changed it, made Mortimer a FILM critic, and had him carp about some movie he'd seen recently, the joke would have fallen flat.  I don't claim to fully understand why this is so.  Part of the reason is this in the movie, at any rate, the reason the joke is such a delicious one has nothing to do with its self-referential nature.  The real joke is that Mortimer has seen so many plays that he has started to act like the characters in them, even at the very moment he reflects on and complains about how stupid they are.  The joke isn't on the nature of fiction or anything like that - it's on HIM.  The scene might well be funnier in a stage performance - I suspect it is - but this particular joke would be lost.It's the fact that the film is based on a play that accounts for the fact that the characters, at times, seem to move around in a confined space as though they're model trains on rails.  I mean this as a compliment.  The cast moves with energy AND precision.  Cary Grant is wonderful.  (He's the one uncomfortable performer in Bringing Up Baby, and a very leaden jester indeed in North By Northwest, but here he shows he CAN do comedy, as well as anyone.)  Timing throughout is flawless.  Just one of several touches of genius the establishing scene at the registry, which all by itself prevents the fact that Mortimer is unaccountably neglecting his bride from preying unduly on our minds (since we've been implicitly told that nothing bad will come of it in the end).No truly great comedy NEEDS to be hilarious in order to be good.

The unfortunate part is that while you get the feeling of the drawn out time period, the movie seems to be too drawn out as well. I was not disappointed at all with the actors or the cinematography; it was simply the plot that turned me off from this movie. Overall if you want to see great acting this film is a good choice, however if you are looking for a good story you may want to look elsewhere. ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"}]
