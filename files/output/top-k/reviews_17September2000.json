Art House auctioneer Michael Felgate (Grant) is in love; when he asks Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn) to marry him, though, she turns him down, and he hasn't a clue as to why.  What he doesn't know is that her father, Frank Vitale (Caan), is a member of a `family' run by Vito Graziosi (Burt Young), and Gina realizes that if she marries Michael he will automatically become a part of it all, whether he wants to or not.  She loves him, but she wants to protect him from the life into which she was born.  An admirable notion; she will sacrifice her love in order to keep him out of trouble.  Michael, however, is not about to accept her answer without further investigation.  He decides it's time to meet her father.  When Frank finds out, he is delighted, and he prepares to take Michael into the family.  Before he can formally introduce his son-in-law-to-be to Vito and the other family members, however, he realizes some training is in order.  That British accent, for one thing, just won't cut it.  In what turns out to be one of the funniest scenes in the movie, Frank then attempts to coach Michael in the finer aspects of `mob' dialect.  Well, `F'gedduhboudit.'  Michael comes off sounding more like Elmer Fudd on Prozac.  By the time Michael finally meets Vito, he has become `Mickey Blue Eyes,' a connection from out of town, and a man of few words. \tAn amiable enough comedy, Makin keeps it all fairly light-hearted, and there are some humorous moments; all in all, however, there just isn't a lot of laughs here.  Grant does a good job with Mickey, relying on his usual stammering and innocent countenance enough to win over the audience.  Tripplehorn makes her Gina just sympathetic enough to make her likable, putting the martyr-for-love aspect to good use.  Unfortunately, there isn't much chemistry between the two;  the performances are satisfactory, but their characters lack that certain something that makes you really want to root for them.  Caan does well in a roll to which he is perfectly suited; in fact, it would seem that this part was written specifically for him.  Young is convincing as Vito, but he really doesn't have much to work with; he looks the part, but it's a thankless endeavor.  Joe Viterelli adds a nice touch as `Vinnie the Shrimp,' and with this one and `Analyze This' under his belt, he should be a made guy by now.  The rest of the supporting cast includes James Fox (Philip Cromwell), Gerry Becker (Agent Connell), Maddie Corman (Carol), Tony Darrow (Angelo) and Paul Lazar (Ritchie Vitale). \tIf you're looking for some light entertainment and a few laughs, and especially if you're a fan of Hugh Grant, `Mickey Blue Eyes' will fill the bill.

How can you be in two places at once, and where do you get that extra pair of hands you need so desperately to stay afloat?  One man finds the answers in `Multiplicity,' a comedy from director Harold Ramis.  Doug Kinney (Michael Keaton) owns a construction company, but finds the demands of the job as well as the needs of his family (a wife and two kids) are just stretching him too thin.  On a job doing some additions to a laboratory one day, Doug begins to lose it; his temper flares and he's at his wit's end, all of which is noticed by a certain Dr. Leeds (Harris Yulin), a scientist, who offers him a solution to his problems.  It involves a project with which the lab has already had some success  cloning.  And once Doug is convinced it can be done safely, he goes for it, and to his astonishment, it works.  He ends up with a duplicate of himself; finally he will be able to get some time off.  Or so he thinks.  His clone quickly finds himself swamped with work, even with Doug's help (they manage to keep the identity of the clone a secret, of course), and decides that he, too, needs a clone.  But it doesn't stop there.  Before it's over, Doug finds himself with three clones; physically identical, but each with a distinctly individual personality.  The first is rugged, the Doug ready for any job, any time.  The second is more in touch with his feminine side; he is quite accomplished and likes to cook.  The third, however, turns out a bit `watered-down,' having lost some resolution, as it were, in the process.  He's a bit slow and just slightly off-center.  He loves pizza, for instance, and keeps a piece in his wallet `for later.'  Pretty soon Doug's wife, Laura (Andie MacDowell) begins to notice some changes in her husband's behavior.  Of course, she doesn't realize that she's dealing with one man and three clones.  All of which leads to trouble in paradise, and some quite humorous situations along the way. \tCleverly handled by Ramis, this is a funny movie and a veritable showcase for the talented Keaton, who manages to create a unique personality for each of his characters.  The scenes in which the four of them are together, and Doug has to deal with `himselves,' are hilarious.  MacDowell does a good job with Laura, giving her enough vulnerability to enable the audience to empathize with her frustration at suddenly having to cope with a seemingly schizophrenic husband.  When she tries to have a serious conversation with the worst of the clones and asks him, `What do you want?' while attempting to sort out their recent differences, and the reply is `Pizza!' it makes you want to cringe, except that you're laughing too hard.  And there are a lot of laughs here. \tThe supporting cast includes Eugene Levy, who adds some droll humor as Vic, a more than inadequate subcontractor who works for Doug; Richard Masur (Del), Ann Cusack (Noreen), John de Lancie (Ted), Judith Kahan (Franny) and Brian Doyle-Murray (Walt).  `Multiplicity' is a highly imaginative comedy that works, and is well presented.  One Michael Keaton in a movie like this is a treat; and here you get four for the price of one.  And that, my friends, no matter how you clone it, can't be a bad thing.         I rate this one 8\/10.

When his father dies, and an agent of the landlord to whom back rent is owed burns their modest home to the ground, Joseph Donnelly (Cruise) vows revenge.  Armed with an ancient, rusty rifle,  he travels to the estate of the landowner, Daniel Christie (Robert Prosky), intending to shoot him.  But his plans to settle the score quickly go awry; as he draws a bead on Christie and pulls the trigger, the rifle explodes in his face.  Christie takes him into his home to treat his wounds, and there Joseph catches the eye of Christie's daughter, Shannon (Kidman).  The lad, she notes, has pluck, and he's obviously a scrapper; and she immediately sees him as the means by which she can effect her dream of running away to America, where they are giving land away for free (or so says the ad she has ripped from a newspaper).  She realizes that such an undertaking would be impossible for a woman traveling alone, but with a man such as Joseph along to tend to her needs and offer protection, it could be done.  Circumstances prevail in her favor, and soon the two of them are off, covertly, with the plan being to land in Boston, then head west to the Oklahoma Territory, where Shannon will be able to claim her land.  Of course, Joseph sees land in it for himself, as well.  They hit a snag, however, upon landing in Boston; Shannon's silver spoons, stolen from her mother, and with which the trek west was to be financed, are stolen from her, leaving them without means.  With some help, they manage to find affordable accommodations (a room at a local bordello), and Shannon finds work in a factory.  Meanwhile, Joseph finds he can make some money by prizefighting at one of the local pubs, under sponsorship of a man named Kelly (Colm Meaney), the `connected' Irishman of the town.  It's enough to keep them going, temporarily, but the question is, can they make it to Oklahoma in time for the `land rush' of 1893? Cruise gives a credible performance here as Joseph, complete with a passable Irish accent, and he has a natural, charismatic persona that comes across so well on film.  Kidman, too, fares well with her portrayal of Shannon; her accent is good, and the camera likes her.  And, of course, there's a real chemistry between them.  Howard has crafted a visually handsome movie, with a good story told in a predominately straight forward manner.  There's not a lot of surprises, and much of it is predictable, beyond mere foreshadowing, but the pace is brisk and the characters are alive, which keeps it all interesting.  Also, there's a touch of humor thrown in at appropriate junctures, which helps to offset the dramatics, maintain a positive atmosphere, and keep it all from becoming too sullen. The cinematography is especially notable, particularly early on, when capturing some of the lush vistas of Ireland, and later during the `land rush' sequence.  The performances are good all around, and the excellent supporting cast includes Thomas Gibson (Steven), Barbara Babcock (Nora Christie), Cyril Cusack (Danty Duff) and Michelle Johnson (Grace).  `Far and Away' is well made and delivered, and, most importantly, it's an entertaining movie; perhaps not one of the most memorable Howard has made, but it's an enjoyable film, and well worth seeing.

While serving a nine year stretch in prison, in England, Wilson receives a newspaper clipping about an accident in which Jenny (Melissa George) died when her car went off a cliff on Mulholland.  When he is released, Wilson goes straight to L.A. to track down the man Jenny was with at the time, a record producer named Valentine (Peter Fonda).  He begins by contacting the man who sent him the clipping, a friend of Jenny's from an acting class, Ed Roe (Luis Guzman), an ex-con himself who steers Wilson to Valentine. \tDirector Steven Soderbergh approaches the material artistically, using a definite pace (occasionally too slow) and interspersing brief flashbacks of Wilson and Jenny, which prove to be very effective.  Stamp does well with his Wilson, having reached an age and maturity that gives him the perfect look and overall countenance with which to ably bring such a character to life.  Fonda's Valentine comes off as fairly one dimensional; he comes across believably enough, but without any of the personal traits or mannerisms that could have made this an interesting character.  The supporting cast includes Barry Newman (Avery), Joe Dallesandro (Uncle John), Nicky katt (Stacy) and Lesley Ann Warren (Elaine). \t`The Limey' is an interesting character study, but hardly compelling.  Wilson is a hard guy, a man who's spent most of his life in prison; it's hard to muster up much sympathy for him.

One day at work, Helen happens across an anonymous letter (the `love letter' of the title) that has somehow become lodged beneath the cushions of a reading couch.  Upon reading the amorous prose therein, she believes it has been written to her, purposely placed in the couch for her to find, and, for reasons of her own, thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer.  Inadvertently, however, Helen leaves the letter out where her employee, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds it, believes it to be for her, and, of course, thinks she knows who wrote it.  Circumstances then bring it into the possession of a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), who thinks Helen has written the letter to him.

One day at work, Helen happens across an anonymous letter (the `love letter' of the title) that has somehow become lodged beneath the cushions of a reading couch.  Upon reading the amorous prose therein, she believes it has been written to her, purposely placed in the couch for her to find, and, for reasons of her own, thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer.  Inadvertently, however, Helen leaves the letter out where her employee, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds it, believes it to be for her, and, of course, thinks she knows who wrote it.  Circumstances then bring it into the possession of a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), who thinks Helen has written the letter to him.

Still, you feel for the big-lug.Things I learned from this movie-bullies spend hours after-school stalking empty bath-rooms-50 cents was a lot to a kid in the 80's.-fight scenes have come a LONG way since the 80's.-Matt Dillon is lucky to still be working after this.The supporting cast is a virtual who's who of 80's talent....Martin Mull, George Wendt, & Joan Cusack.I wouldn't shell out a dollar to rent it (unless I was throwing a cheesy-80's party) but if it comes on cable (and it will, they always do) give it a chance.

I was 10, and as a 10 year-old I loved it. Re-watching it at age 30, I was prepared to groan through it. But I was pleasantly surprised at how well it holds up.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Chris Makepeace (Wudy da' Wabitt from Meatballs) stars as the new kid in school. He's rich, has a really bad mushroom-cloud of a hair-do, so naturally...he's a primo target for the school-bully (Matt Dillon).Bullies in my school never wanted protection-money, but these bullies do. Simple math your milk change = I won't whoop your butt.But our fashionably-challenged hero is no dummy, and he figures if you're gonna shell out dough to a psychopath...it may as well be one you like! Enter Ricky Linderman (Adam Baldwin) as the bodyguard. Ricky is universally feared and completely misunderstood. And he looks old enough to have flunked 6 grades.A friendship soon forms, walls are torn down, and a feel-good movie is your end result. If you like buddy-movies where the jerk(s) get theirs in the end, this one's for you. The lead characters are likeable, and you're rooting for them all the way.

Haven't you? As you might guess from that description, Duets is a seriously creepy film; that quality comes less from the seediness of the bars depicted in the film's karaoke underground or the squalid circumstances of characters who (I kid you not) redeem themselves by singing badly over canned rhythm tracks than in the sheer desperation reflected in every scene. But there's not enough space here to catalogue it all, so let's focus on the movie's creepiest moment, in which Lewis and Paltrow get on a bar stage at a national karaoke sing-off in Omaha, Nebraska, and perform...Smokey Robinson's `Cruisin'.' You know, the 1979 hit in which Smokey pledges--as nicely and romantically as possible but still clearly enough for anyone past the age of 11 to understand what he meant--to have sex all night long? Yep. That's the song father Huey (whose voice--what little of it was there to begin with--is now completely gone) sings with daughter Gwyneth (who sings surprisingly well but *come on*), all under the direction of Gwyneth's real-life dad Bruce Paltrow. Huey even gives Gwyneth a little peck on the cheek. 2000 will not see a worse movie unless Ed Wood rises from the grave, camera in hand.

Of course, his character  -- a self-described renegade preacher -- is about the most arrogant, pretentious, bullying nitwit ever passed off as an adventure hero. The preacher's bellowing hostility and vicious emotional manipulation might have been something interesting and different if the script didn't seem so unaware that the character is, well, a jerk. The other male characters are pretty much stock types, though the always-reliable Roddy McDowall as a hapless ship worker is dignified and touching.The women do even worse than the men -- among them are a bitchy ex-hooker, a starry-eyed teenager with a crush on the boorish preacher, and a hot-pantsed halfwit of a lounge singer who frequently becomes paralyzed with terror and has to be comforted in the manly arms of Red Buttons.The single female character with any depth at all is Shelley Winters' sweet Jewish grandma, whose swim through the flooded propellor room ultimately makes it possible for the others to be saved. A generation of unkind jokes aside, her sensible, brave performance is the best thing in this very silly movie.
