One of the props that stands out most is the rifle. Some props also have a symbolic meaning. The peace badge and the helmet with born to kill may seem like some joke, but they can also symbolize that the soldiers are fighting for peace.Since the movie isn't actually shot at a training facility, all of the obstacles are props. They are, however replicas of real versions. Because none of the movie is shot on location, even the helicopter scenes are made with scale models. This is done quite nicely, since it took some research to discover this.The clothing also plays a significant role throughout the movie. All soldiers are shaved bald and wear the same clothes. This stands in sharp contrast to the drill sergeant, who wears much neater clothes. Because all soldiers wear identical clothes, and are we are forced to look for physical differences. For example this makes private Pyle (the chubby guy), stand out even more. Later on however, during the fighting scenes in Vietnam, the soldiers are much more recognisable. This is because they have hair again and personalised their uniforms. Also, throughout the entire second half of the movie, there is very little change in uniform. The clothing also includes some special effects. Blood bags, for example, are used to fake death, because there was no CGI when the movie was made. We can see this in an earlier scene where the drill instructor gets shot. Background In addition to this we will now talk about the use of background in Full Metal Jacket. In Full Metal Jacket there aren't any animated background pictures, because the film was shot in 1987. At that time they didn't have the techniques that could do this. However a lot of the movie has been shot inside of a studio. Because of this the movie directors had to use pictures as background. Watching the movie the viewer will not notice the fake background. However if you pay close attention to the background, you will notice that the backgrounds are mostly fake.There is one scene in which private Pyle is out of bed by night in the toilet room. The whole scene is dark and a lot of dark colours are used in this scene. In this scene Pyle is talking with private Joker holding a gun. Pyle blames him of his failure. From all the noises they make, they wake up the sergeant. He then goes to the toilet room to take a look. He finds Pyle with Joker in the toilet room. He tries talking Pyle out of shooting. When he realises he fails, he starts shouting and yelling towards Pyle. Now Pyle points the gun at the sergeant and shoots him. When watching this scene you feel that the scene is unbalanced. This is because viewers only notice something when it's abnormal. With the unbalanced distribution of light and colour in the scene, the scene looks unbalanced. This already gives a hint towards what is going to happen. Which you can see, is correct, because the sergeant is shot. Nevertheless there is a balance in the objects in the scene. On each side of the room there are an even amount of toilets, symmetrical opposite each other. This is a great example of the use of composition in the movie. Actors Another significant use of Mise en Scene was their choice for the actors playing the recruits. It was done in such a fashion to make private Pyle stand out due to his weight because all of the other recruits are skinny\/decently built, while Pyle is fat, which gives you the impression that Pyle is going to fail at becoming a good recruit.The drill sergeant also played a major role in the movie. He dominated in the first half of the movie, because he was always there to insult the recruits and thus mainly focused the attention on two other characters; private Pyle, who always screws up and private Joker for making remarks all the time. Furthermore, in the beginning of the movie, the recruits are being shaved, in this scene you can see that most of them have long hair. This gave us an idea of what the recruits are like, which made us have some sort of relationship with the actors. Besides this, it also gave us an idea of the time in the movie, the 70s, which was confirmed by the song playing in the background of the scene 'goodbye sweetheart, hello Vietnam'. By having their hair shaved off, it shows that they are ready to start their new lives as recruits.Our opinion We will now give our opinion, with regard to the movie. We don't like the movie regardless of its humorist parts. This is because the movie actually never begins. It feels like you are watching a 2 hour intro. So when watching the movie you are expecting, scene after scene, the movie to actually start, which we think is very irritating. Further when watching the movie you don't exactly get to know who the main character is. In the first half of the film the film lets you think that private Pyle is the main character. But after he kills himself, it becomes clear that the main character is actually private joker. This is confusing for the viewer. Even tough Full Metal Jacket is considered as a classic war movie. It's just like the bible, just because it's considered a classic, doesn't mean its any good.

The movie is about the worlds greatest detectives who get invited to a mansion where they are challenged to solve a murder which hasn't been committed yet. The plot has some holes, they are quite annoying, but it isn't the plot that made me hate the movie. The core concept is actually not that bad.The biggest problem I have with this movie is the dialogue, the acting, the depiction of the characters and that it is not at all funny.Lets start with the funny part. The key to a good joke is timing. Some of the jokes could have been funny but there is no timing. The jokes go on and on and sometimes the joke is even explained by the detectives. There are many possibilities to make jokes around the blind servant and the deaf housekeeper but they are making more or less the same jokes over and over again. Many of the jokes are outright offensive to the Chinese and women.Every single character is a stereotype. Which isn't so unusual in this genre but they are all played so over the top that you can't connect to any of them at all. The Chinese detective (Mr Wang) is insulting. He speaks this stereotypical Chinese accent and is an insult because he mocks the culture of the Chinese people. He frequently says offensive things. He even says he bought his sidekick. Slavery wasn't a real thing in china at that time. I know racism wasn't such a big deal back then, but even at that time this was considered downright offensive.The writer tried to make fun of the cliché characters in detective literature and movies but didn't know where to stop. None of the main characters are likable. I hated every single one of them.Sam Diamond, an American detective, (I believe he was from Chicago) has this silly accent. I didn't really understand how this character fits in the movie. He is kind of a distraction from the general style of the movie. He is kind of a mockery of film Noir detectives. That doesn't really fit into this kind of detective story. He is extremely offensive towards women. Well I know it was most likely intended as humor because the film noir movies of the 40s and 50s are often considered sexist. But what is funny about a man mistreating women.I could go on about the characters but I just wanted to give you an example.Most of the movie the characters do nothing at all they are just annoyingly talking to each other in silly accents. When I watched 20 minutes of the movie I lost all interest and was suffering through it.

Being born less than 20 years ago I'd lie if I said I was not slightly put off by it being in black and white; how stupid was I. The book itself was great and to my surprise the movie portrayed Harper Lee's story excellently. To those still wondering whether to watch this 1962 classic, do it!

One line that stuck to me from the novel is Miss Maudie telling Scout after the trial had been lost I thought, Atticus Finch won't win, he can't win, but he's the only man in these parts who can keep a jury out so long on a case like that. This pretty much sums up Atticus's determination to give Tom Robinson a fair trial despite what the rest of the community may think.The child acting was impressive and the characters of Scout and Jem were portrayed as children should. They were naive and silly, doing stupid things and disobeying their father time and time again. But during the three year time spine in which this movie plays off you see them growing, taking more of Atticus's advice in along the way. Scout is of course our main protagonist and she and her brother were highly relatable and contributed to the success of this movie.ConclusionI recommend this to almost everyone.

He directed some really wacky and bizarre movies back in the day when he was younger. I am not sure what he was into back then, but this movie is pretty darn crazy. Now I personally don't watch a lot of blood and gore flicks, but if you are a audience member that likes splatter comedies, this one is up there. Watching this movie was like watching a Evil Dead movie, probably Army of Darkness with zombies in a early 90's setting. I for one didn't find this movie all that funny, but it does have few amusing parts for me. When it comes to the plot, it's about this guy named Lionel who is the hero of this story that has a mother that gets bit by a Sumaratan rat-monkey. Soon she gets sick, dies and turns in a zombie and starts eating everyone that is near her. Including dogs, nurses, friends and neighbors. Lionel is caught in the middle of trying to take care of this crisis while trying to save his relationship with his girlfriend. If you like over the top gore fest style movies with weird characters and decent development, this movie might be worth checking out. Instead of a lot of CGI effects that are used now a days, this one actually gets pretty creative when it uses props and other materials like stop-motion. You will get RIDICULOUS amount of blood in this. Even the zombies themselves have somewhat different traits that they bring to the table. However be warned, this movie really isn't for audiences with weak stomachs. This is one of those movies that is well worth seeing with buddies.8.3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 June 2014","score":"","review":" Before Peter Jackson directed the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit films.

The film is a satire of confusion and misunderstandings in religion and politics. It is not a mockery of Jesus or his life or teachings. Brian is a fictional character not meant to resemble Christ. Even as a Catholic sensitive to mockery of Jesus Christ or his Church, I am not offended by the satire in Life of Brian and acknowledge that the film is not blasphemous. The blasphemy accusations against this movie are ridiculous, and I wonder if those who made these statements even watched the film. Life of Brian by Monty Python is one of the greatest comedies ever put on film. I don't think there was a single scene in the movie that didn't make me laugh. Then again, what else can one expect from Monty Python? The troupe combines their intelligent satire with their total absurdity as usual. They portray their silly view on life as brilliantly and hilariously as always. The renowned closing musical number, Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, sums up the whole philosophy of Python, and is by many men on crosses, despite the obvious slow and painful death they're going to suffer. Monty Python, everyone! The entire film is like this. Life of Brian satirizes the misunderstandings in religion, and shows how silly some people can be. At the beginning of the movie, hundreds of people are gathered and listening to Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, but get so caught up in misunderstandings and bickering over little things they completely miss out on what Jesus is saying and the meaning of what he says. What was that?I don't know. I was too busy talking to big nose. I think it was 'blessed are the cheesemakers'.What's so special about the cheesemakers?Well, obviously it's not meant to be taken literally. It refers to any manufacturers of dairy products. This happens throughout the movie. The people will take pieces of statements and completely reinterpret the entire statement (need I bring up the media today?) Brian (played wonderfully straight-faced by Graham Chapman) keeps telling the people that he is not the Messiah, but the people don't listen, and take little things as signs of divinity. Jesus is alive at this time and they're aware of his existence, but they keep going after Brian anyway. When Brian points out a juniper bush, the people believe that it is a miracle and a sign that he is the Messiah. Brian is a normal guy and is aware of it, and he simply wants to be left alone. At one point he even tells them that he is the Messiah just to get them to f*** off. Even then, the people ask him how shall we f*** off, oh Lord? The movie also sneaks in some hilarious biting satire on left-wing politics of the 1970's, slightly tying into the silliness that can possibly arise from misunderstandings in religion or belief in impossible things, such as a man's right to want to give birth. It also shows about their desire to complain about everything and present themselves as victims when they're actually pretty well off. This idea is realized in a group called the People's Front of Judea (as opposed to the Judean People's Front). Their leader, played by John Cleese, spends the entire movie complaining about how the Romans have done nothing for the Judeans, and yet in a scene is given a list of what the Romans have done for the quality of life in their community. Everybody in the film seems to be picky. A Roman centurion catches Brian painting graffiti on a palace, and he does not complain about the vandalism, but he complains about the grammar of the Latin graffiti itself. And during all of this film, Graham Chapman as Brian is the only straight-faced one amongst a huge group of people who are insane. Classic Chapman there, and classic Python.

OCP has begun to move forward in their master plan to create a better Detroit, this plan is known as Delta City. Unfortunately for the citizens of Detroit, this means destroying their homes. There is strong opposition to this, so OCP deploys armed mercenaries known as Rehabs. Their job is remove people from their homes by force. One of these people, is a computer whiz kid named Nikko. After her parents are arrested by the rehabs, she is found and taken in by the leader of the resistance movement. Meanwhile, it is revealed that OCP has been bought out by a Japanese corporation. (This comes into play later) So a short time later, RoboCop and Lewis track Nikko down at an old church. Unfortunately so have the rehabs and their leader, McDaggett. He and the rest of the rehabs have orders to kill all the people in the church, but RoboCop and Lewis refuse to stand down. RoboCop can't fire on the rehabs because of Directive 4 (I'll explain what this is later.) McDaggett and the rest of the rehabs open fire on them and thus, Officer Anne Lewis is killed. I'm sure many of you can guess why this infuriates me on multiple levels! Not only does RoboCop do absolutely NOTHING to save the life of his friend and partner, but the biggest problem, is that her death has zero meaning or purpose! This is one of my favorite things to complain about in a bad movie or sequel. If you're going to have a main character die, IT MUST HAVE A PURPOSE!!! For example in Star Trek II, Spock dies to save the lives of The Enterprise's crew. In Aliens, Gorman dies to atone for his mistake. In Cruel Intentions, Sebastian dies to save the woman he loves. In RoboCop 3 however, Lewis dies only to get her out of the film, and to add a cheap revenge motive for RoboCop to get the bad guy. So...anyway, RoboCop takes a bazooka to the chest, McDaggett and the rest of the rehabs leave him for dead, He joins the resistance and decides to fight for their cause, the Japanese corporation dispatches a robot samurai to deal with RoboCop and the resistance, the cops all quit when they're forced to work with the rehabs, RoboCop takes out McDaggett and the rest of the rehabs, and of course, saves the day. Now let me explain what that Directive Four crap was, and why it makes no sense here. In the original film, Directive four was a fail-safe put in by OCP's corrupt vice president. Which meant that RoboCop could not apprehend, or act against any member of OCP. Here's why it makes no sense First of all you would think, that after the events of the first film, that RoboCop's designers would've taken that out, so something like that wouldn't happen again. Second, after being left for dead by the rehabs, RoboCop simply deletes the directive. If he could do that at any time, why didn't he just do that earlier, and why couldn't he do that in one of the previous films? To sum it all up, RoboCop 3 pretty much sucks all around. The climax was halfway decent, but the rest just sucked. The lead actor doesn't even come remotely close to filling Peter Weller's shoes, the humor isn't funny, Anne Lewis dies for no reason, the main villain isn't even the least bit threatening, and 90% of the time RoboCop is always getting his a$$ kicked! I don't blame Frank Miller for the movie being bad, everyone knows that the studio determines how a movie is made, and how it will turn out. In fact, If you're a fan of RoboCop, and want to see What could've been. I recommend you pick up one of Frank Miller's RoboCop graphic novels. I've read one of them myself, and it was excellent! You'll get much more entertainment from reading one of them, than you'll get out of this cinematic pile of crap! Like most poorly done sequels, RoboCop 3 could've been great, but all it turned out to be was a last-ditch effort to squeeze out more money for the studio. If you haven't seen it, skip it.

The lead actor doesn't even come remotely close to filling Peter Weller's shoes, the humor isn't funny, Anne Lewis dies for no reason, the main villain isn't even the least bit threatening, and 90% of the time RoboCop is always getting his a$$ kicked! I don't blame Frank Miller for the movie being bad, everyone knows that the studio determines how a movie is made, and how it will turn out. In fact, If you're a fan of RoboCop, and want to see What could've been. I recommend you pick up one of Frank Miller's RoboCop graphic novels. I've read one of them myself, and it was excellent! You'll get much more entertainment from reading one of them, than you'll get out of this cinematic pile of crap! Like most poorly done sequels, RoboCop 3 could've been great, but all it turned out to be was a last-ditch effort to squeeze out more money for the studio. If you haven't seen it, skip it. If you have, do yourself a favor and pretend it never existed!
