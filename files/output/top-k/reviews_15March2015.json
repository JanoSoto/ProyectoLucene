That's thanks to powerhouse acting and a first-rate script (Serling). Quinn's unforgettable as the damaged fighter, his face a mile of battered road, with a voice to match. Now he's at the end of that road. After all, even an athlete's body can only take so much. Trouble is he's the meal ticket for manager Maish (Gleason) who owes money big time to gangland thugs who will take him on a ride if he doesn't pay up. So maybe the desperate Maish can talk the slow thinker into prostituting himself as a phony wrestler. After all, doesn't Mountain owe him after their years together. At least that's what the exploitive Maish claims. Still, Mountain's got a chance at a decent job, thanks to employment counselor Miss Miller (Harris). So what will Maish do, and, more importantly, what will become of the ex-pug.What a fine cast. Gleason's Maish is not so much mean or evil as he is weak, that is, a manager willing to take advantage of his hapless charge. His dour expression and tight manner are about as far from the boisterous Ralph Kramden (The Honeymooners) as night is from day. Then too, Quinn's got the slow-thinking stammer down perfectly, projecting real pathos behind his lumbering hulk. Rooney's role as trainer-handler is more incidental, serving mainly as the trio's observer and conscience. And, of course, there's Broadway's distinguished Julie Harris as what amounts to the conventional world's Miss Miller. If there's a flaw in the film, I suspect it's with her not-very-clear interest in Mountain's life. But maybe the ambiguity is intentional, her limits being reached once Mountain makes a pass.That scene where a drunken Mountain goes to interview on a job Miss Miller has arranged is almost painful to watch. Maish has sabotaged Mountain's chances by getting him drunk. Worse, the interview's at a ritzy hotel, and loosing an inebriated lug there is almost like the fabled bull in a china shop. To me, the scene shows two worlds coming wrenchingly apart, dashing Mountain's best hopes. In fact, it looks like the movie is really about the three man family and how it also comes apart. Hard to think of a fight film being poignant, but this one is. It's salutes all around, even to the appropriately seedy sets. All in all, the results show that author Serling was as much at home in lower city precincts as he was in the upper zones of twilight.

I literally grew up with the album... my parents would play it at me ever since I was a wee one, so you can understand that I would be interested to see a movie version of it. Oh, God, I wish I hadn't.This movie takes everything that was good about the album and jettisons it out the window. Look, I don't need the movie adaptation of anything to be 100% accurate to its source material, but please be at least 50% accurate...40%? 20? 5? Ken Russell twists the story into something horrid and ugly, and turns the music into something gaudy and excessive. Gone is the dark subtlety of the album... now we have Ann Margaret rolling around in baked beans and Elton John going glitzy (as is his wont) and Oliver Reed singing badly. And Jack Nicholson singing. Badly. Russell even manages to mess up having Tina Turner in his movie, with her over-the-top rendition of Acid Queen... how can you mess up Tina Turner? That part should have been awesome.

Matilda, like Dahl's other works are dark and over-exaggerated humour and content. As a kid, I really felt bad for Matilda and Miss Honey. There are also plot holes and things I would there to have been added. But for what it is, it is good.In Mara Wilson's best-known role, she plays the titular character born into a family of neglectful and mean parents (DeVito and Perlman). She is super smart and learns how to take care of herself by age 2, while her dumb mother goes off to gamble and her father sells phoney and stolen car parts for unfair prices. We get a good look into her family life and feel really bad how horrible she is treated. The older I got, the more I couldn't help laughing. Although a serious subject and lots of sympathy towards Matilda, it is a lot funnier than it is sad. That is the kind of dark humour that Dahl loved to do. She enrols in school where she is subjected to a principal worse than her parents the evil, former-Olympian Agatha Trunchbull (Ferris). Trunchbull throws kids out the window and long distances for any bit of misbehaviour; she also has a non-deadly iron maiden in her office called the chokey. It is very unrealistic how none of what she does goes unreported. But, this is part fantasy. I think that Pam Ferris should have won an Oscar for her role as Ms. Trunchbull. While Matilda's parents are cruel, it is down in a very hilarious manner; but Trunchbull is even funnier because she is worse. it is over-the-top at its best. Matilda's teacher is the kind Jennifer Honey, who has parallels to Matilda. She soon learns that she has special powers which she can uses for good and bad. When Matilda learns the secret connections between Miss Honey and Ms. Trunchbull, she devices a plan to destroy Trunchbull once and for all. This takes place over the course of days, some of which can be frightening to younger audiences. I know I was when it came out. Matilda's parents move to Guam by the end to escape the keen FBI and Miss Honey adopts Matilda. I do like the fact that Miss Honey and Matilda end up together, but I wish that she destroyed her parents in a similar manner to what she did to Trunchbull. Matilda's parents have abused her her entire life while Trunchbull was mean just a few weeks. We do see Matilda do funny pranks as acts of revenge, but it's not enough.

Trunchbull throws kids out the window and long distances for any bit of misbehaviour; she also has a non-deadly iron maiden in her office called the chokey. It is very unrealistic how none of what she does goes unreported. But, this is part fantasy. I think that Pam Ferris should have won an Oscar for her role as Ms. Trunchbull. While Matilda's parents are cruel, it is down in a very hilarious manner; but Trunchbull is even funnier because she is worse. it is over-the-top at its best. Matilda's teacher is the kind Jennifer Honey, who has parallels to Matilda. She soon learns that she has special powers which she can uses for good and bad. When Matilda learns the secret connections between Miss Honey and Ms. Trunchbull, she devices a plan to destroy Trunchbull once and for all. This takes place over the course of days, some of which can be frightening to younger audiences. I know I was when it came out. Matilda's parents move to Guam by the end to escape the keen FBI and Miss Honey adopts Matilda. I do like the fact that Miss Honey and Matilda end up together, but I wish that she destroyed her parents in a similar manner to what she did to Trunchbull. Matilda's parents have abused her her entire life while Trunchbull was mean just a few weeks. We do see Matilda do funny pranks as acts of revenge, but it's not enough. At least it has a happy and realistic ending. Despite flaws, Matilda is a genuine movie that keeps the laughs and smiles rolling.

Appeal to popularity is an argumentative fallacy that individuals of all levels adopt in their conversational discourse. Now let's go to the review. American History X captures absence\/lack\/irrationality of egalitarianism in a very unique way. Using Nazism, it extends its effects to the black community. Edward Norton (crazy-eyes) suited the role only from physical and expressive way; he was pretty bad from the vocal perspective; the guy can't do working-class roles at all; I mean let's face it, the guy's voice appears to be of an over-intellectualized kid doing weed, not a hipster or gangster. His acting nonetheless was superb, like when officers are arresting him and he looks at Danny with that psychotic smile (crazy-eyes, no?) The nigga-facta was good. Almost all the extras in the movie were African-Americans. I think this was a directorial flaw. America's still flowing with Whites. I'm not personally against blacks, in fact I've a lot of Afro-Am friends myself. But that doesn't mean that you flood the set with them. But then looking at the low-budget, it's acceptable. Moreover, the movie didn't look at perfection, but realism and digging the small-scale on-goings in America and potentially all over the globe.American History has nothing but Norton's acting and screenplay (even that limited to the amount of touch with real-life scenario). But what it has is delivered with excellence. The story keeps you ponder over the ruthlessness of all sides. The world isn't so perfect as shown. You can't expect things to be rational, or mildly reasonable. Even paternal guidance isn't entirely logical, neutral and aimed at resolving physical and mental issues. I was hit down by the movie, and I started to question the logical sense and accuracy of white man's burden claim. From Derek's skull-crushing to his assault in prison, and from that to Danny's ultimate redemption, everything builds up your trust with the movie, and believe me, whatever it says, you'll start following it the same way. So yeah that's probably the only good-thing about it. With everything said, I think if you look from the low-budget perspective and director's mindset, you'll realize that film's intention and imparting was limited and it successfully got what it aimed. However, from the dramaturgical viewpoint, it lacks several accessories.
