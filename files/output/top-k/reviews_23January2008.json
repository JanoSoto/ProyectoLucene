[{"date":"23 January 2008","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Before Brad Bird found success with The Incredibles and Ratatouille, he directed this little seen film, The Iron Giant. Bird is one of the true auteur's of modern animation. Despite only three films to his name, the man is quite simply a genius. His films represent the finest examples of family entertainment. Ones that appeal to adults and children alike. And he understands what makes a film accessible to a child. You don't talk down to them. Just talk to them.The Iron Giant was given a curious lack of advertising by Warner Bros. It was just dumped into cinemas with very little advance notice. And not surprisingly, The Iron Giant did next to no business. And that is a real shame. Because its one of the greatest animated films you will ever see.Taking a leaf out of ET's book, and based on the short story by Ted Hughes, The Iron Giant follows the tale of a 100-foot robot that crashes to Earth in Rockwell, Maine, 1957. Bird has deliberately set the film in Cold War America. In fact the setting is just days after the Russians launched the Sputnik satellite. So the atmosphere is expectedly tense and paranoid. Most Americans of that era thought anyone who wasn't a member of the USA was their enemy. And its unfortunate The Iron Giant should have to land on Earth during such a dark era.Hogarth Hughes is a schoolboy obsessed with the stars. He watches all the classic B-movies. Collects all the comics. Has posters of Forbidden Planet proudly displayed on the walls of his bedroom. But when the TV goes on the blink one night, Hogarth goes outside and investigates. Their antenna has been bitten off the roof. Someone has left a trail of destruction behind them. Cars. Wagons. And when Hogarth follows them, he comes across The Iron Giant.When Hogarth saves him from being electrocuted at a power plant, the two become fast friends. Hogarth sort of adopts him, and has to go to great lengths to conceal him from the outside world. No easy task considering his insatiable appetite for metal. And when a government agent comes snooping around, it isn't long before war breaks out between the townspeople of Rockwell and the innocent Iron Giant.Anyone who hasn't seen this film must go out and buy it immediately. Because you are missing out on one of the most perfect family films ever conceived. Brad Bird never puts a foot wrong. He strikes the perfect balance between comedy, action and touching sentiment. Its a film where you never feel like you're being patronised or lectured to.Although ET did spring to mind while I was watching this film (and Bird has worked with Steven Spielberg in the past), I think The Iron Giant is far superior. ET felt (to me anyway) like a calculated attempt on Spielberg's part to push all the right emotional buttons at perfectly timed intervals. I never felt any manipulation during The Iron Giant.Bird crafts the friendship between Hogarth and his new friend with surprising sophistication. Hogarth's attempts to humanise the machine is conducted with real skill and expertise. Since Hogarth knows they're living in dangerous times, he knows exactly how the people will react if they saw The Iron Giant. They'll only see a monster. Something alien. And in they're minds, anything that's alien must be destroyed.Bird also does a great job evoking the atmosphere of 1950's Cold War America. The film has many accurate details that will immediately strike a chord with anyone of that era. Such as the disturbing Duck and Cover programmes. And Bird makes sure the fear and uncertainty of the times are neatly represented too. Like paranoid conspiracy nuts and straight arrow Army Generals.But the crux of the film is Hogarth's friendship with The Iron Giant. The way these two outsiders find a friend in each other. The film gets a lot of mileage out of the different adventures they get up to. Whether it be slapstick, like Hogarth doing a cannonball into a lake, and when the Giant tries it, he ends up draining all the water. Or sentiment, like when Hogarth discovers what the Giant really is.The film has a very strong anti-gun statement to make. None more so than the scene when the pair come across a deer in the woods shot by hunters. Hogarth makes a very impassioned speech about how its wrong to kill. And how to make the right choice.Its genuinely shocking to discover the Giant is a weapon. His crash to Earth has robbed him of that knowledge. But his programming kicks in whenever he feels threatened. Something not helped by the Army coming to take this 'monster' down.The Iron Giant has to make a choice between being a gun, and being a person. Which will he choose? Or will his programming make the choice for him? Pretty heady material for a so-called kids film.Brad Bird has a clear love of retro futurism, something he lavishly displayed in The Incredibles, and here too. The Iron Giant is a tall, galumphing behemoth. But Bird does a great job making him seem endearing, especially with a surprisingly animated metal face. And the different weaponry inside of him is pretty inventive too. He's got more add-ons than the Swiss Army!Things come to a very moving conclusion when the Giant must sacrifice himself for Hogarth and the people who hate him. Its very saddening, and will leave you feeling depressed for days afterwards. Odd to feel such compassion for an animated character isn't it?The Iron Giant is an unforgettable experience. One of the finest animated movies ever made. And all the more remarkable for having the ability to move and enchant you as much as it does.

She's really an enchantress. She turns him into a beast, and placed a magic spell on everything and everyone in the castle. He then secludes himself in his home, with a magic mirror as the only view to outside the castle. The rose will bloom until he turns 21--pretty young for a prince, eh? He needed a girl to fall in love with, and get her to love him back, then it would be all good. And if not, he's doomed to stay as a beast forever and ever. The narration--by David Ogden Stiers, who plays Cogsworth--was great, and really like ...for who could ever learn to love a beast? The next scene, we meet a young girl named Belle, a very beautiful but very odd girl, because she always likes to read, and is somewhat of an outcast, like her father, Maurice. The song 'Belle', which is a great song, really shows how much she's different from everyone else, and that she wants more out of life than just her small, poor French town. And really, don't we all want more out of life? A man, Gaston, the town 'hunk', wants to woo Belle, while his oddball sidekick, Lefou, doesn't think that she's the best of the best, as opposed to Gaston. Belle knows that he's handsome, but 'rude and conceited' as well, and not for her. As she gets home to help Maurice, who's working on what could possibly the weirdest machine made to chop wood. At least it works, and he takes it to the fair.He and his horse Philippe trot off to the fair, but they get lost. Men and their direction skills. That last statement was just a stereotypical thing, because we see it happen often. So they take the dark, gloomy road that Maurice wants to go, rather than the safe, light road that Philippe wants to take. Maurice should've listened to the horse. But of course, then there would be no story. Maurice then realizes that it's not right, and as usual, blames Philippe for it, because no one wants to take the blame for something that they did wrong. They get chased by a pack of wolves, Philippe gets away, and Maurice ends up in the castle where the Beast lives, but he doesn't know that. When he gets in, we get introduced to Cogsworth and Lumiere, the clock and candelabra, who are pretty much opposites, and Lumiere's welcome eventually wins over Cogsworth's attitude to get Maurice out. Lumiere makes him comfortable and Mrs. Potts and Chip, a teapot and teacup, serve him tea, and then the scary part comes. Enter the Beast. Maurice gets taken to a prison.The next day, Gaston tries to get Belle to marry him, but our heroine knows better, and works a way to get him out, and she finds Philippe, who amazingly tells Belle in some form or way that Maurice is gone. They try to find him, and immediately Philippe wants to leave, but Belle keeps him steady. She goes inside the castle to find him. As she searches, the servants in the castle see her, thinking that she's the one who can break the spell. Lumiere and Cogsworth try to remain inconspicuous, and Belle finds her father, and the Beast finds them. Belle then makes the sacrifice of her life she takes her father's place, and promises to stay forever, after seeing the Beast. She feels terrible and without a goodbye, Maurice is taken back to the village. Belle is told that she can go anywhere in the castle except the west wing, because it's forbidden. She is told that she must join the Beast for dinner that night. She then finds out that everything is enchanted,and she is stunned. She decides she's not going to go to dinner. After finding out she's not coming down, the feud between the two of them grows. When Belle comes down to eat, Lumiere starts to sing 'Be Our Guest', and it is entertaining! After the number, Belle is taken by Lumiere and Cogsworth for a tour and Belle stumbles upon the stairs that lead to the west wing. She tricks them into taking themselves to the library, and ventures into the forbidden zone. She sees some peculiar things, but she then sees the most intriguing object of all the rose. She wants to touch it, but is caught by the Beast, who scares her away from the castle. The Beast saves her from death by wolves.The Beast and Belle dance with Mrs. Potts singing 'Beauty and the Beast', and it makes their bond so much better. Belle realizes that her father is sick, and the Beast releases her, because he loves her. The town find out about the Beast, and try to kill him. The servants fight back, in a hilarious battle, while Gaston goes in for the Beast. The Beast and Gaston fight each other, and Belle returns for the Beast, but right as they reach for each other, Gaston stabs the Beast, but then karma gets back at him and he falls to his doom. Belle tries to keep the Beast with her, but it seems too late. She whispers to him, I love you, right before the last pedal falls. The spell is broken, just in time. Sparks fall from the sky, and the Beast resumes his original form, and they kiss.

","genre":"Animation, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"23 January 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Yes, Cruising has gay people. Lots of them. Most of them in leather, costumes (there's a cop night at a club, ironic for Pacino's character), who lead double lives with their leather and homosexual sex at night, and successful careers during the day. But as William Friedkin points out repeatedly on the newly released DVD, the West Village Manhattan backdrop of the S & M bars and bondage-fetish lifestyle is just that, a backdrop. He's not intending to make a statement either way that this way of life is bad or not. It's a murder mystery story that, in a sense, could've took place in any environment (look at it as though the setting were regular heterosexual bars, with a man getting at women, and it wouldn't be much different if only for, uh, sex and misogyny misplaced). It's still meant as neo-noir, and it's a good one. That it's not great should be expected.It's plot ends up a little confusing (which, Friedkin also said, is part of his own metaphor for the story in the picture as one doesn't know who is really the killer, killers merging perhaps, or a killer still lurking at the end of the film even as things look tidy plot wise). But this isn't too much of a deterrent to enjoying the bulk of Cruising, as a cop (Pacino) goes undercover in the Village to search for a killer who's taking out gays, either by stabbing repeatedly or by cutting off a body limb or two, dumping in the river.

'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934)' was one of the director's first major successes, and is among the strongest of his pre-1940 British output, a tense and atmospheric thriller with a truly sinister villain in Peter Lorre in his first English-speaking role after fleeing Nazi Germany. In 1956, at the peak of his fame, the Master of Suspense decided that the story was ripe for a remake, and that he might as well be the one to do it! James Stewart and Doris Day play a respectable American couple whose family holiday to Morocco ends in disaster, when their young son, Hank, is kidnapped to prevent the exposure of a London assassination attempt. Though the story is exceedingly simple, and the film itself never really amounts to anything more than two hours of impeccable entertainment, 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)' is quite noticeably a Hitchcock film, and the director's ability to thrill and amuse us has rarely been stronger.It is a genuinely fascinating exercise to compare Hitchcock's two versions of the same story, as it gives us the opportunity to pinpoint exactly how the director's craft evolved following his migration to Hollywood. In a 1967 interview with filmmaker and critic François Truffaut, Hitchcock referred to the 1934 version as the work of a talented amateur, and the remake as the work of a professional. This is certainly an accurate description of both, though I'm going to have to go against the grain and suggest that the original version is the ever-so-slightly superior film, if only for having a strong villain in Peter Lorre compared to the remake, which has nobody quite so memorable. The acting performances in the remake are solid and effective, especially the two leading stars. Doris Day, in a welcoming break from the stereotypical helpless wife, plays a graceful yet independent motherly figure, so determined to rescue her son from the kidnappers that poor Jimmy Stewart can hardly keep up. Despite her husband's apparently-low opinion of her capabilities he insists that she take sleeping pills before he informs her of Hank's disappearance, Jo McKenna proves equally instrumental in facilitating the film's happy ending.The undisputed centrepiece of 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)' is, of course, the incredible Royal Albert Hall sequence, a breathtaking dialogue-free 12 minutes that stands as one of Hitchcock's all-time most impressive set-pieces. With composer Bernard Herrmann conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, the Master of Suspense uses music and visuals to create the necessary suspense. The musical piece, the Storm Clouds cantata, was originally written by Arthur Benjamin for the 1934 film. Slowly but surely, the orchestral piece increases in tempo, drawing ever-so-slightly closer to that critical moment when the musician claps together the two giant cymbals a scene that was already shown to us during the opening credits. Despite the climax of the film failing to live up to the tension of the Albert Hall sequence, the remainder of the film is certainly intelligent, creative, suspenseful and hilarious, and no Hitchcock fan should be disappointed. If you're yet to check out the 1934 version of the film, then I also wholeheartedly recommend that one.

Vincent Price was Dr. Erasmus Craven. Peter Lorre as Dr. Bedlo, Boris Karloff as Dr. Scarabus, Hazel Court as Lenore, and Jack Nicholson as young Rexford Bedlo were the remainder of the main cast. Richard Matheson did the screenplay.The Raven is another of Corman's Edgar Allan Poe cycle of films. Like most of them, great liberties were taken with the original Poe tale. In this one, the raven, with the voice of Lorre, appears at the home of magician Dr. Erasmus Craven, who is pining away time lamenting the loss of his deceased wife, Lenore. It seems that the cantankerous Bedlo has been transferred into a bird after losing a battle of magic with the famous Dr. Scarabus. After a much-too-long opening sequence in which this is explained and Craven restores Bedlo to human form, Bedlo informs his host that Lenore is indeed alive and staying with Scarabus in his castle. This is too much for the grieving Dr. Craven, so he and his daughter Estelle, played by Olive Sturgess, and Bedlo with his son Rexford, who has conveniently shown up at Craven's front door, venture forth to the castle of the feared Dr. Scarabus. Fortunately, The Raven becomes much more interesting at this point.Horror and comedy, in my humble opinion, do not often mix, but they co-exist in The Raven about as well as I've seen. The Raven, shot immediately before The Terror utilizing the same sets, is probably a better film but not as interesting to fans of pure horror as the latter.Portions of the coach ride to Scarabus' castle can be viewed in one of the segments in Gallery Of Horrors, (1969), and the distance shot of the castle on the hill is all too familiar to Corman fans.However, I digress. When the motley group arrive at Scarabus castle, they find that Lenore is indeed alive, that she left her somewhat dull husband for the interesting life that the aging Scarabus could provide, and that she and Bedlo were used by him as bait to lure Craven to his lair, where he wishes to learn more about Craven's superior magic skill. One thing leads to another, and the film climaxes with a magician's duel between Craven and Scarabus. The duel, eight minutes long on screen, is legendary in the annals of horror film-making. (See The Raven for this alone if for no other reason). I won't spoil the ending for you so I will only say that everyone gets what's coming to them in the end! But, there are plenty of other reasons to view The Raven. Karloff, (at his best here!) Amusing and ominous at the same time), Price, Lorre and Nicholson together in one film, for one. Film historians seem to appreciate this unique gathering of extraordinary talent more than they do Karloff and Nicholson together in The Terror, and perhaps this is to be expected. (Horror film fans owe AIP a huge debt, for it, more than any other studio, kept the careers of such players alive during this period. See Karloff, Price, Lorre and Basil Rathbone in 1963's Comedy of Terrors, a film similar to The Raven and which also includes a small but memorable role for comic Joe E. Brown). Hazel Court is beautiful and delightful as the scheming Lenore, a woman any man could easily yearn for and be seduced by. Indeed, The Raven enjoyed fine performances from all the players.Old villain Peter Lorre. Late in his career he was pleasing in humorous parts. Lorre was not a well man during this period, but his performances live on. He was the equal of Robin Williams when it came to ad-libbing and driving co-stars crazy! It is interesting to note that young Nicholson, while not the actor he would become, holds his own very well against the veteran co-stars he played against, particularly Lorre, who portrayed his acerbic, browbeating father.1962's Tales of Terror, a three-story trilogy, included The Black Cat, (by, you guessed, AIP), a humorous look at the Poe tale starring Vincent Price and Peter Lorre. Horror humor doesn't get any better than it is in the works I have mentioned in this article. I give The Raven, very atmospheric with those marvelous sets, three well deserved stars, perhaps 3 1\/2 stars to be generous. The magician's duel by itself would rate four stars. That classic scene would play well in a modern day film with state of the art special effects!Go ahead and rent Comedy of Terrors and Tales of Terror while you're at the video store and make a very pleasant weekend out of it. I promise you won't be disappointed.If you'll invite me over, I'll bring the popcorn.

Vincent Price was Dr. Erasmus Craven. Peter Lorre as Dr. Bedlo, Boris Karloff as Dr. Scarabus, Hazel Court as Lenore, and Jack Nicholson as young Rexford Bedlo were the remainder of the main cast. Richard Matheson did the screenplay.The Raven is another of Corman's Edgar Allan Poe cycle of films. Like most of them, great liberties were taken with the original Poe tale. In this one, the raven, with the voice of Lorre, appears at the home of magician Dr. Erasmus Craven, who is pining away time lamenting the loss of his deceased wife, Lenore. It seems that the cantankerous Bedlo has been transferred into a bird after losing a battle of magic with the famous Dr. Scarabus. After a much-too-long opening sequence in which this is explained and Craven restores Bedlo to human form, Bedlo informs his host that Lenore is indeed alive and staying with Scarabus in his castle. This is too much for the grieving Dr. Craven, so he and his daughter Estelle, played by Olive Sturgess, and Bedlo with his son Rexford, who has conveniently shown up at Craven's front door, venture forth to the castle of the feared Dr. Scarabus. Fortunately, The Raven becomes much more interesting at this point.Horror and comedy, in my humble opinion, do not often mix, but they co-exist in The Raven about as well as I've seen. The Raven, shot immediately before The Terror utilizing the same sets, is probably a better film but not as interesting to fans of pure horror as the latter.Portions of the coach ride to Scarabus' castle can be viewed in one of the segments in Gallery Of Horrors, (1969), and the distance shot of the castle on the hill is all too familiar to Corman fans.However, I digress. When the motley group arrive at Scarabus castle, they find that Lenore is indeed alive, that she left her somewhat dull husband for the interesting life that the aging Scarabus could provide, and that she and Bedlo were used by him as bait to lure Craven to his lair, where he wishes to learn more about Craven's superior magic skill.

The film certainly makes sense in comparison with a quest narrative such as Hawthorne's Young Goodman Brown and in light of Freud's ideas about love as well as Nietzsche's thoughts on the Dionysian self. It's also a film that pays constant homage to Hitchcock's best work, notably Vertigo, Rear Window and Psycho, in its preoccupation with spectator psychology and voyeurism.Basically, Blue Velvet is about the rites of passage of a young man after a descent into the underworld of his home-town. However, the man emerges from his experience neither sadder nor wiser. Instead, Lynch cynically reprises the film's innocent opening with its hopelessly artificial, Pollyannish, post-card pastoral idyl that is most likely the preferred reality of the American mainstream movie consumer. At the same time, he preserves the tenuousness of such a naive vision with the shot of a deliberately artificial insect impaled on a robin's beak and with a soundtrack that subjects the theme song to a disturbing treatment out of some internal, subterranean sound studio.This film has so many meanings, it would be exhausting to write even half.

'Decent but unremarkable flick, probably good special effects and lots of actors shouting above crashing waves and whistling winds' &#150; that was the verdict I was expecting to be giving once the film has finished. A couple of hours later I came out of the cinema pleasantly surprised, shaken and moved by the intense and rewarding film I'd just seen. The Perfect Storm is a genuine sleeper &#150; a film much better and more satisfying than you'd expect, which remains in the mind long after you've seen it.In the fishing town of Gloucester on the Atlantic coast of America, Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) returns from what should be the final haul of the season with a disappointing catch. He persuades some of the local fishermen to join him for one last trip, a final shot before the season closes at earning enough cash to live comfortably. The crew consists of Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), David Sullivan (William Fichtner), Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne), Bugsy Moran (John Hawkes) and Dale Murphy (John C. Reilly). As the sailors set off on their fishing trip, their friends and families wave them off in silent dread, as they do every time they set sail &#150; knowing that their loved ones are at the mercy of Mother Nature on the deep blue ocean. Once they're far out to sea, the guys begin reeling in the fish, but their catch yet again is shaping up to be a disappointment. So Tyne takes them out into the middle of the ocean, the Flemish Cap, where they start catching hundreds of gigantic fish. Meanwhile, two ferocious storms collide behind them, making the journey back perilously dangerous. A third storm changes course and adds to the maelstrom, creating the most intense and powerful storm of the century &#150; the perfect storm, as an excited meteorologist declares. Tyne's crew begin their trip back with a full cargo, but unwittingly sail into the middle of this unimaginable storm. They find themselves and their ship &#150; the Andrea Gail &#150; locked in an incredible struggle to stay afloat, while their loved ones back home wait in anguish for them to return.By and large, The Perfect Storm hits the right notes and emerges an absorbing and involving film. There are occasional moments of awful dialogue &#150; Billy, you're sailing into the middle of the monster! shrieks Mary Elizabeth Mastrantoinio in one particularly awkward scene &#150; but aside from this the film is excellent stuff. The storm scenes are terrifyingly staged and leave one rocking in one's chair, especially on the big screen (see this in a cinema if you can). The story wisely takes its time in the build-up to the storm, sketching in character backgrounds and character relationships so that we actually give a damn about the protagonists. James Horner's music is cleverly used to generate tension and emotion, and Wolfgang Petersen keeps the film low-key but fascinating during the first hour and as intense as possible during its second hour. All in all, a highly impressive and commendable film.

The proof is same freedom topic, miraculous victories against overwhelming odds, same facial expressions of Gibson, and again the English are the bad guys. Here, however it's much more questionable.Were the English really that brutal? The burning of the people in the barn, this has been mentioned previous, and obviously this never happened.Gibson kills people virtually at random. He's Rambo in the woods. I mean Before this war is over, I'll kill you. This film is below average and inferior to Braveheart in every respect.This is also has absolutely no root in US History.

But I had to say, I was disappointed, the Redux brought nothing to the movie except boredom, irrationality, and extreme length. The point of AN has gone and I felt like watching a complete mess. The scene Willard and his guys trade their fuel for bunnies is so ludicrous that made me laugh so hard, I paused a minute to calm myself down. The French Plantation scene was too long to watch, even though I have a long attention span, I still couldn't watch it through. After such loooooooong time, I totally lost my interest in seeing the Redux, I turned my TV off right before they got to Col.Kurtz. Francis Coppola cut out those scenes for good reasons and now he addded them again? I have to say this is my first time I was let down by Francis Ford Coppola.

The kind of plot used is the same which have been used so many times before. The production is much worse than the previous films (at least comparing with the first two movies). The soundtrack is very different too and it's terrible (it's between very poor pseudo-mysterious sounds and a cheap imitation of PSYCHO's tube scene track). But if the production and the soundtrack are really bad, the acting is not better; especially the performance of Dawna Wightman (who plays DEBBIE). It's incredibly awful! Is she a professional actress? I really don't think so! Anyway, this chapter doesn't add anything new to the series and it would be totally unnecessary!
