The film's approach, interestingly, has us see the film through one pair of eyes in American soldier Private Zab (Carradine), an observant and would-be author who is constantly looking for material for his new book, but our attention is drawn to the battle wary Sergeant, simply named 'The Sergeant' and played with the sort of no-nonsense gusto Lee Marvin has evoked in the past in such films as Point Blank. The Sergeant is a veteran from the First World War, during which the film opens with him killing a German soldier despite the war having already ended. Alas, he wasn't to know the point is raised that it could be seen as murdering a fellow man, despite him being the enemy mere hours ago.And that's from whence the film's primary study arises; an asking of why soldiers are doing what they're doing and whether killing is justified when you're at war with someone else. You do not murder a fellow human being at times of war, you merely kill the enemy. Later on, the film will pause for thought when the American platoon we follow discover a Nazi Concentration Camp and I think they sort of begin to realise that a lot of killing took place at this other camps like this, raising the issue they've lived on for the entire campaign of whether all the killing is justified in war. It's at these camps, of course, that so many innocents were rid of the world by the Germans and that quite simply has to be murder, but to the Nazis, they were enemies that needed to be killed. So it's all about what the individual believes and that echos the study the film makes. One of the more powerful scenes in the film is when an American soldier continues to fire into a dead German soldier after having foiled his ambush. I don't think the American knows what to think anymore, about the war or the philosophy about killing\/murder, and just keeps doing what 'the soldier' knows to do fire a rifle into those they're told to do so at. Like a machine, he just plugs away &#x96; shocked, confused and very disturbed.But my general gripe is that the film hops around Europe too much, encompassing so many backdrops and theatres and situations; particularly when the film rather bizarrely jumps to D-Day in France in 1944 from operations in Italy and North Africa and then onto that Concentration Camp. Any war film leaping about from Africa, to Operation Overlord to a Death Camp is clearly trying to get across a sense of scale but do we really need this when the study is about a close knit bunch of soldiers and the issues they raise amongst one another &#x96; such an intimate study between people at such a time does not need to have a large backdrop overwhelm it. The film would've still worked without most of the D-Day and North Africa set action.But another positive aspect of the film that is quite clearly evident is in regards to the close knit bond the soldiers have as they work their way through the war. It lies within the approach director Samuel Fuller takes - the sense we get during the scenes of war and just prior to them. This is not a war film focusing on bloody action as much as it is the drive to commit the bloody action. The scenes just prior to the warfare are so much better than the warfare themselves. The occasions during which the platoon are hiding, or observing, are fantastic. One occasion sees them in a cave as a German tank division rumbles past, now and again an enemy troop will come in for whatever reason and they must eliminate them. There is a high risk factor and it's toyed with at various points before scenes of action. There are additional scenes later on during which the platoon must dig in under a tank division and French troops are unsure whether to open fire on incoming Americans. These scenes prolong anxiety in the sense they can be so close to both death and victory at the same time and act as some of the best scenes in the film.If the D-Day sequence does serve a purpose, it's to simply highlight the ridiculousness of war when one after another, American troops are being called up and forced to crawl to their doom as they attempt to deliver some Bangalores. It's a hopeless and desperate situation, a casual disregard of human life as individuals are labelled mere digits and sent off by that number to their death. But the film holds firm and is generally really well directed by Fuller. He cannot direct action too well, but his suspense in certain scenes, his ideas and the overall study are most definitely there; for added realism and focus, it even takes the platoon two attempts to destroy an enemy vehicle with a grenade because the first doesn't go right. I read after seeing the film that director Fuller based the film on a few of his personal experiences during the war, bringing a very personalised tone to the film which he gets across. The film begins with an eerie image of Jesus Christ witnessing the aftermath of war and a 'murder' taking place, but we end overall on a positive note &#x96; the same mistake made again, but with an renowned sense of optimism this time.

Having heard nothing but good things about it over and over and over and over again on the internet and in person from just about everyone, I sat down and finally watched it this morning, prepared to enjoy it. I had high expectations, but knowing that it is frequently referred to as 'the most underrated comedy ever made' (not anymore it isn't!) I did also half-expect this to be a wildly overrated film, especially having read some reviews not written by the 'people don't get Mike Judge's comedy' crowd.What's the film ultimately like? Well, it's definitely funny. It's a solid comedy script with generally solid acting from most (and some bad performances too, Jennifer Aniston most irritatingly just doing pretty much what she did on that abominable nightmare of a television 'comedy' Friends), especially Ron Livingston in the lead role and Ajay Naidu as Samir.Of course the workplace comedy\/satire is nothing new and where my disappointment in Office Space comes from is that it's so, so far from being as good at observing office life as some other stuff, most notably of course the UK version of The Office. Office Space paints in very broad strokes, focuses on easy targets (annoying office printer) which is funny enough but there could have so easily been more to the movie, and for all the talk about the subtle, sly irony of the humor, it's all pretty uninspired, simple humor. The characters are all cartoonish (Peter Gibbons slave of corporate machine who breaks free, Samir Arab focused on job security and out of place in the corporate culture, Michael Bolton guy with same name as celebrity attempting to break free of nerd persona, Joanna waitress and love interest we know virtually nothing else about), but most egregious of all is the absolutely horrendous caricature that is Milton. I can't believe people find him funny. Look how weird he is, Judge says to us while cramming another scene with Milton into the dull, far too easily concluded plot. No really, isn't he just like that weird guy at the office. Look how he talks! Dumb, dumb, dumb nonsense. I might have been less offended by this character if this movie hadn't been constantly sold to me as intelligent and observant satire. Overall the movie is definitely funny and has some absolutely brilliant scenes which are deservedly famous (including the legendary printer destruction), but is also tremendously disappointing and with all the talk from everyone I've ever spoken to about this movie depending on subtle irony and even surreal humor, well I didn't see much of that. In fact the humor of the film is exceptionally broad, which is a perfectly acceptable style of humor to write, no doubt, but when there is so much dependence on unfunny, stupid caricatures like Milton, an exceptionally dull romance, and a plot which lets down the mostly excellent first half or so of the movie and is resolved in such a convenient fashion... Well, the movie just doesn't get points for being a mildly funny satire on office life, especially when I can just watch The Office again.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"20 April 2009","score":"33 out of 38 people found the following review useful","review":" Yes.....Alien 3 was an embarrassment, especially after all the pop-culture and movie influence that both Alien and Aliens put on. Alien was perhaps the greatest horror ever made, even surpassing The Exorcist and Halloween. Aliens is a sure contender for being the greatest action\/sci-fi movie ever filmed. And just knowing these two facts is why this movie fails, because there was so much riding on this and it turned out to be disappointing. And they also seem to be going back to the first film with the idea of the lone warrior alien and they don't do anything new except make the alien a quadrupedal. But of course, it's understandable because what else could they make of the Alien series? A comedy? But the entire film doesn't present itself very well and that's why it fails.After the end Aliens, Ripley, Newt, Hicks and Bishop are still in hypersleep until a face-hugger on their ship somehow causes a fire (which makes no sense) and then cracks through Ripley's cryo-tube and impregnates her. Then the spaceship crash-lands on a an all-male prison planet with Ripley as the only survivor. But the face-hugger (which can somehow infect twice) infects a dog, and then all hell breaks loose in the prison.After they couldn't get either Ridley Scott or James Cameron to come back, they gave the job to film auteur David Fincher while he was still a rookie, and his lack of experience is painfully apparent in here. He just doesn't generate a lot of suspense or tension and we start to ponder our reason for watching this movie in the first place. The supporting characters are just a bunch of useless scum that people call prisoners and there isn't a single explanation given as to why we're supposed to care about them, especially Dillon who is perhaps one of the most repulsive characters I've ever seen put on a film. He basically puts down Ripley because of her gender and even unemotionally states to her I am a murderer and a rapist of women. And you're gonna feel totally magnificent when he ends up dying in vain while fighting the alien at the end. And it also doesn't reveal anything new about the Ellen Ripley character and she's sorta flat in here. But Sigourney Weaver doesn't do that bad of a job at playing the character that she plays best.And also as for the alien itself, its really dumb and poorly done. The idea of it being modeled after a dog isn't remotely interesting nor is it threatening. And also the scene when the chest-burster pops out of the dog was really disturbing to watch and also unnecessary. If it's horror that you're trying to make, you have to make scenes that are scary but at the same time you still want to watch it, and the dog's death scene did neither of that. Honestly, I hope that same dog bit the director and the writers in the @$$'s really hard. And also it was basically poorly done because it was the early 1990's and it was obviously a puppet that they were using and it was very stilted and totally fake.

Then the spaceship crash-lands on a an all-male prison planet with Ripley as the only survivor. But the face-hugger (which can somehow infect twice) infects a dog, and then all hell breaks loose in the prison.After they couldn't get either Ridley Scott or James Cameron to come back, they gave the job to film auteur David Fincher while he was still a rookie, and his lack of experience is painfully apparent in here. He just doesn't generate a lot of suspense or tension and we start to ponder our reason for watching this movie in the first place. The supporting characters are just a bunch of useless scum that people call prisoners and there isn't a single explanation given as to why we're supposed to care about them, especially Dillon who is perhaps one of the most repulsive characters I've ever seen put on a film. He basically puts down Ripley because of her gender and even unemotionally states to her I am a murderer and a rapist of women. And you're gonna feel totally magnificent when he ends up dying in vain while fighting the alien at the end. And it also doesn't reveal anything new about the Ellen Ripley character and she's sorta flat in here. But Sigourney Weaver doesn't do that bad of a job at playing the character that she plays best.And also as for the alien itself, its really dumb and poorly done. The idea of it being modeled after a dog isn't remotely interesting nor is it threatening. And also the scene when the chest-burster pops out of the dog was really disturbing to watch and also unnecessary. If it's horror that you're trying to make, you have to make scenes that are scary but at the same time you still want to watch it, and the dog's death scene did neither of that. Honestly, I hope that same dog bit the director and the writers in the @$$'s really hard.

For me though, the best performance was by Nick Stahl as Bobby, the bully of Bully. I couldn't stand his character, yet at the same time, I found myself disturbed and disgusted by the scene where he was brutally murdered by his supposed best friend and his gang of skeevy accomplices. I also found it sad that the only character with any real potential for a future was the one that was killed, although I know this film was based on a true story so I guess that aspect couldn't really be altered too much. Yes, Bobby was a perverted closet homosexual and a wacked-out psychopath who fed his sadistic nature by beating up his best friend Marty on a regular basis, verbally abusing him to bring down his self-esteem, raping girls, and raping Marty even. But deep down, looking past of all his screwed up flaws and mental issues, you could see that he had potential as a human being to excel in life and make something of himself, as well as the possibility of changing his ways and actually becoming a decent person, maybe after finally coming out of the closet and realizing Marty would still be his friend without being forced to stick around through constant physical and verbal abuse.The rest of the characters annoyed me quite a bit. Marty seemed to have absolutely no depth, minus his desperation to escape the torment of being his best friend's b*tch. His girlfriend Lisa was even worse, with her needy and clingy obsession with Marty, even though she knew nothing about him except that he was a hot surfer babe who was good in bed and as much of a nymphomaniac as she was. Ali was your typical sl*t with zero sexual boundaries, willing to basically screw anyone and anything that was a willing participant, including her female drug addict friend Heather, another irritatingly shallow character. Heather's character was that of a skanky dirty-looking bored teenage girl just out of drug rehab. Donny was somewhat entertaining with his obvious stupidity and cluelessness, although he was just as burned out as Heather was, if not more so. Derek really served no purpose as far as characters go. He was just sort of there to go along for the ride. And Leo, the supposed hit man, was just a loser to put it lightly; a loser with a bad temper, actually.The only thing that these characters really have in common is that they are all bored, stupid, rich, spoiled, doped up on drugs, and have the sex drive of a rabbit during the spring time. The sex scenes between Marty and Lisa were too often and completely unromantic. They lacked any real chemistry and had an empty physical relationship that for some reason has Lisa convinced that it was true love. To be honest, the relationship between Marty and Lisa drove me nuts because it reminded me of a relationship I once had when I was around the same age they were. That was probably the only aspect of the movie I could really relate to considering I've never been that bored or wealthy that I decided to gather up some random acquaintances and go murder someone I don't care much for.As far as plots go, the story is tragically pathetic due to the characters being so eager to kill this guy that they were completely unprepared to handle the consequences of getting caught, which naturally, they did. It's a sad story, especially since it's true, but like I said, the only character I liked was the actual bully, Bobby. The rest of them were just plain annoying. And to be honest, if that's how these dumb kids actually were in reality, then I'm glad they're in prison. They shouldn't be allowed to reproduce anyway. My rating is 6 out of 10 stars, strictly for Stahl's character.

In hindsight I realised that the box set was cheaper because you would have to pay someone to take Batman and Robin out of your shop.Please for the love of God do not watch this movie, even if you are being paid to. I was genuinely angry that any actor, director or producer would allow this film to be made, given that it does not stand alone but is part of a franchise.On the plus side, it was the production and circulation of this film that ensured that the franchise was reinvented some time later. I will, however, never forgive Joel Sh**macher for p***ing on Tim Burton and his hard, artistically excellent film making.Shame on everyone concerned with the making of this film.

I am not a comics person but I loved how Burton handles such a dark and complex individual. Coupled with some awesome casting (most notably big Jack who has more charisma than I dare try to quantify) the films have a truly universally appeal.Enter Joel Schumacher.... I believe the conversation went something like this Producers Hi Joel, Batman is arguably the most interesting comic book character and we have made two really good Batman films. We have decided to contractually release the actors and director who made this franchise so good. Is there any chance you can make a bad Batman film and then follow it up with a film so stinking that it could kill the franchise forever.Joel Not a problem. Do you mind if I waste a lot of your money in the process and try and destroy some acting careers as well? Producer Why not?

Sally Potter is an established art-house filmmaker with particular interests in gender politics and dance. She also sings, writes and, in this film at least, acts.Tango is a dance drawing heavily on passion. Unlike many dances, its emotional range includes jealousy and betrayal.

A woman never escapes the man's embrace. The brilliance of her steps give the appearance of being entirely due to her partner's masterful guidance. At one point in our movie, Potter's partner, enraged, tells her she must 'do nothing' &#x96; he means nothing that doesn't come from him.It is a perfect dance to build dramatic metaphor around.But Potter's interest goes further. She wants to examine role reversal (this is the director who has had a hit a few years earlier with the sexual ambiguous Orlando). In The Tango Lesson, she plays opposite a top tango dancer, mentally submitting to him in order to learn the dance. Her character is a film director, disillusioned with a Hollywood deal and looking for a new project. Could it be dance? In the second half, she enlists him to play in a film. The power position is reversed. He must follow instead of lead. He must take direction.The success of this plot relies almost entirely on its real life elements.

The tango scenes are among the best of any motion picture. Tango on the stage, tango on the streets. Tango in the dancehalls, tango on the water's edge. Tango in rain, tango in snow. Potter described some of the technical challenges, saying that in the rain there were, a limited number of takes possible due to the limited number of dry jeans. But the result is stunning.

Potter deals with simple male chauvinism, and in a matter-of-fact rather than an unkind way. Pablo and his friends act in a 'perfectly reasonable' manner which Potter then exposes as unreasonable. They cherish a glamorised idea of film-making. She has to exert gentle authority when they 'decide' that they've waited long enough for someone to turn up; or when Pablo might not 'want' to shed a tear in her 'little film.' She must &#x96; and does &#x96; handle their unprofessional emotions, fears and ignorance, exactly as Pablo had to handle hers when she was learning to dance. And now it is against his every instinct. He must follow and let her lead.Potter takes us beyond gender politics to the creative process. The film opens with her wiping a white table, then she sits at it with a blank sheet of paper. She starts to script, but discards one idea after another. Fast cuts to bursts of colour (in the Hollywood movie she had originally planned to make) illustrate action sequences of a movie style that makes money. They are like fragments of a finished film, waiting to be found. She hovers, waiting for the right idea to take form. I know this moment well.

So when I went to see the Phantom Menace I was expecting something great like the original three films. Soon I learned that my expectations were not to be reached.There is a lot of problems going on. The trade federation and the confederates hope to kidnap Queen Amidala of the Naboo and force her to sign a treaty to make their invasion legal. Qui Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi rescue the Queen and take her to Tatooine where a young boy named Anakin soon becomes their only hope of getting her back to Coruscant.The story and plot of this film for me seemed a little too political. I have to admit that when I first saw this film I had no idea what the conflict was about. It involves taxation and invasion and a lot of political aspects. I think that for the most part the story is not really that exciting, it is more compelling in a sort of way if you understand political concepts.More so than any film I had seen up to the point when I saw this film, this film relied greatly on computer and visual effects. All of the non human characters are created by computer animation and a lot of the settings look computer animated. This film seemed to rely way too much on effects and if they spent one tenth of the time that they spent on Visual effects on the story then this film would have been way greater. If anything this film proved that a film with a great story and decent effects will always be better than a film with a decent story and phenomenal effects. Just saying.I knew that there would be some characters from the previous series as well as new ones as well. I thought that Qui Gon Jin, played by Liam Neesan, was awesome. Truly a great jedi. I thought that Obi Wan Kenobi seemed to be lacking in this film and does not get to say much and is more supporting. I really loved Natalie Portman in this film. She is as talented as an actress as she is beautiful and she is awesome as Queen Amidala.I did not like all of the characters though. Jar Jar Binks is on screen way too much. The way that he is depicted as a clumsy ignorant fool just makes me want to cry. A character like him in Star Wars just did not work for me, sure there were characters in the original series that were comical, but Jar Jar is just a joke. Also Anakin Skywalker, little Annie, just did not cut it for me. Looking at him and how he acts like an obnoxious little kid and how everyone calls him Annie does not make me believe that he could ever become Darth Vader.ANother thing that is lacking in this film is the villains. The main bad guy is Darth Maul, but he only appears here and there and is not consistently felt as a threat throughout the way that Darth Vader was in the other series. Maul was great when on screen, but did not get nearly enough time. The Emperor is in it a little bit, and the Vice Roys of the Trade Federation are there but the villains could have been way better.The pod racing scene was OK. I mean, it basically is like the race in Ben Hur but with pod racers and more visual effects added. Nothing special, but OK.The lightsaber action is awesome. Especially the duel between Darth Maul and Qui Gon and Obi Wan at the end.OVerall, slightly disappointed with it. It relies on visual effects heavily and has an OK at best plot.

I had heard many reviewers state that Alien 3 is by far the worst of the entire Alien series and a terrible film. For the most part those reviewers were correct.Basically Ripley winds up a planet that is a prison for criminals. During the ship landing while she was asleep, Newt and Hicks both died. An alien managed to sneak aboard the ship and infects a dog and creates a new dog alien that starts to cause problems for everyone on this planet.First off, I have to say that the story and acting were particularly bad. Why on Earth did this prison planet have NO FREAKING WEOPONS ON IT! It made the conflict somewhat more interesting but that idea is super dumb. Also none of the supporting characters were really that interesting. I did not like how they killed off Hicks and Newt right off the bat. There is no doubt that they just killed them off because they could not get the actors that played them to appear in this film.Sigourney Weaver is pretty good as Ripley in this film, but she always is good. Still, this is her worst performance I think and I blame more of it on a bad director and script then I do on her. It is like Simon Cowell once said to a bad contestant on American Idol, Coaching you would be like coaching a one legged person to a gold medal in the one hundred meter dash. If the script and plot is bad, the acting will often suffer as a result.The Alien is OK. It is kind of cool how it emerged from a different animal, this time a dog. It gets in some good action, but since the rest of the film was so bad, it really was not worth the wait at all. Also the whole alien point of view shots were kind of stupid because it made the alien seem to move much slower than they appear to in the film.So, bad plot and bad characters. Sigourney Weaver is OK and so is the alien, but I do not recommend this film.

I had heard many reviewers state that Alien 3 is by far the worst of the entire Alien series and a terrible film. For the most part those reviewers were correct.Basically Ripley winds up a planet that is a prison for criminals. During the ship landing while she was asleep, Newt and Hicks both died. An alien managed to sneak aboard the ship and infects a dog and creates a new dog alien that starts to cause problems for everyone on this planet.First off, I have to say that the story and acting were particularly bad. Why on Earth did this prison planet have NO FREAKING WEOPONS ON IT! It made the conflict somewhat more interesting but that idea is super dumb. Also none of the supporting characters were really that interesting. I did not like how they killed off Hicks and Newt right off the bat. There is no doubt that they just killed them off because they could not get the actors that played them to appear in this film.Sigourney Weaver is pretty good as Ripley in this film, but she always is good. Still, this is her worst performance I think and I blame more of it on a bad director and script then I do on her.

Wolfgang Petersen's epic Das Boot is one of them, as it has introduced the submarine war film, a genre that later included hits such as The Hunt for the Red October, Crimson Tide, etc. However, although several fascinating films located in submarines have been produced to date, none can be compared to Petersen's masterpiece. Das Boot, although nearly four hours long and set in basically the same location throughout its duration, is a breath-taking experience during which you are hooked to it from the first moment until the last.Das Boot is the story of U-Boot captain Kapitanleutnant Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Prochnow) a.k.a. Der Alte, and his crew, while they carry out a mission in the Atlantic. The story is viewed through the eyes of war correspondent Lt. Werner (Gronemeyer), who is accompanying the crew in this mission; Werner is standing out as a total stranger in the beginning, but throughout the ordeal he eventually blends completely with the team and becomes an inseparable part of the whole. There are also other theoretically major characters in the film, such as Leitende Fritz Grade, the 1st and 2nd WO, etc., but in the end it boils down that in fact there is NO major character The major character of the film is actually the U-Boot itself, and all the people inside it are simply parts of this character.Petersen delivers an amazingly claustrophobic atmosphere inside the U-Boot which looks like a human trap. (An example of the unbelievably cramped space is that when the officers are dining, the occasional sailor who needs to pass through asks for permission to pass, and someone has to stand up to make room for him!). More importantly, he is studying exquisitely the personalities inside the U-Boot and their interactions. Several minor sub-plots develop throughout the film, but they simply serve to enhance the major plot, which is none other than the story of the submarine's mission, portrayed from beginning to end.The movie graphically portrays the agony and terror of the crew as they go through their ordeal, as well as their gradual transformation from frightened kids to battle-hardened comrades-in-arms. You cannot escape from empathizing with them When they almost asphyxiate due to insufficient oxygen, the viewer himself feels that he also needs to gasp for air...When Das Boot came out in 1981, it became a big hit, and understandably so.

Yeah, if you enjoy classical music, you'll really enjoy the soundtrack, too, under the guidance of conductor Leonard Roseman.Not to be overlooked is the fine acting and the interesting and underrated story. I say underrated because this film, from what I've read, bored a lot of people and and it was a box-office flop. That's too bad because, frankly, I found the story (outside of the first 10--15 minutes) to be fascinating.

Marnie's most visible flaw is that it doesn't seem to know what kind of movie it wants to be at first it seems like a tale of petty crime, with Tippi Hedren's lead role committing the sort of minor embezzlements that also introduced Psycho a few years previously. Throughout its runtime, it then alternates between a story of lost mother-son connection - Hitchcock's obsession with mothers taken to the extreme, a romance, and an obsessive examination of a pretty blonde... another signature of the director. In short, it's a mess. As a character, Marnie has nightmares, sees red a lot, and goes catatonic when men try to touch her, but Hitch is woefully unable to tie all this together and make it work. What kind of film, for example, takes over an hour to provide the audience with any inkling of tension, any reason for Marnie's deep-seated psychological fears to alert to us that the plot was, you know, going somewhere? The first half of the picture, all dreary set-up in which bland details are thrown around - Marnie likes horses, her mother is odd, she dislikes thunderstorms, blah, blah - is incredibly slow-starting and boring; Hitch doesn't quite seem to know how to handle an actor of Sean Connery's calibre, and so keeps him on the backburner until well over the halfway mark. Once Connery secures an actual role in the picture's plot, as Marnie's makeshift husband, he works his best charm, and certainly manages to lift the latter end of the film's overlong two hours up from pathetic to passable, but he's given such a nothing character that he fights an uphill battle. He is even dubiously made to commit a horrific sex act in the film, alluded to in typically sly Hitchockian fashion, with the intention that his ultimately good intentions - him being Sean Connery, of course - will allow us to forgive him. As for Hedren as Marnie, she certainly shows a greater acting range than she did in The Birds, but is still mostly hit-or-miss, occasionally intoning her lines wrong, putting emphasis in the wrong place, or just appearing generally apathetic when her challenging role calls for something more compelling - to be fair, this may also be because of the poor manner in which the script is handled. There is little chemistry between Hedren and Connery, although they do work up a single excellent scene, one worthy of Hitchock's oeuvre, in which the two have a fast-talking battle of wits, trying to probe each other's weaknesses. The interesting thing is that Marnie almost rewards the viewer's patience at the end, with a twist ending that finally explains Marnie's behaviour. In this section of the film, the pace suddenly jerks forward into life, moving too fast in the last fifteen minutes as Hedren and Connery confront Marnie's definitely not-quite-right mother. The climax is well-filmed, however, making effective use of flashback, and the movie could have cut any number of meaningless scenes and focused more on this plot thread to make Marnie the intriguing psychological drama it was supposed to be. As it is, Hitchcock seems out of his depth, or at least unable to get a grasp on his source material and actors in this, one of his worst films. Bogged down with lumpy exposition, patchiness, and in need of editing, most of all Marnie needed some enthusiasm.

The climax is well-filmed, however, making effective use of flashback, and the movie could have cut any number of meaningless scenes and focused more on this plot thread to make Marnie the intriguing psychological drama it was supposed to be. As it is, Hitchcock seems out of his depth, or at least unable to get a grasp on his source material and actors in this, one of his worst films. Bogged down with lumpy exposition, patchiness, and in need of editing, most of all Marnie needed some enthusiasm.

And what's wrong with that, to paraphrase Mr McCartney? That said, the movie has a density at its core which is hard to penetrate and is promulgated by a too-complicated plot and probably just too much dialogue.There's much to admire though, particularly in the cinematography and acting stakes. For the former, period is convincingly recreated, not least with some wonderful old cars running around country roads and especially with the massive code-breaking construct inside Bletchley, a juggernaut of dozens of clicking dials. I liked the acting too and even if Dougray Scott's accent sometimes drifts north from its supposed Yorkshire moorings, he displays no little range in depicting the damaged genius of the piece, this in the movie immediately following his pumped up appearance as a super-criminal in MI2. Kate Winslet is also good, no air-brushing or Titanic ball-gowns here as she frumps up effectively as the don't fancy yours much friend of the captivatingly pretty Saffron Burrows' Clare who ensnares Scott's Tom Jericho in her machinations. Jeremy Northam is also fine as the smooth, double-talking investigator at Scott and Winslet's heels.On the debit side, the plot really is quite impenetrable with more convolutions than a convolution machine and which had my head spinning pretty well as much as the dials on the tracking equipment at Bletchley, but then it's well known that Mr Stoppard likes a puzzle or two. I'm all for keeping the audience hanging on every word but there are so many of them here that it's difficult to properly weigh up their significance in the context of the narrative. The few action set-pieces on board seem too detached from their surroundings to really engage and often seem like drop-ins, while the Scott\/Winslet relationship seems to blossom unconvincingly from nowhere at all.However, it's fair to say, in conclusion, that this period thriller, while successfully recalling the depth and feel of British war-movies of the 50's, doesn't quite transcend that achievement and seems to lack fulfilment as a cinematic entertainment. That said, just how do you successfully dramatise as mundane and unglamorous a profession as code-breaking, so that overall, I'm bound to say this was a noble attempt and more than likely a film that will repay repeat viewings, to more satisfyingly uncover the myriad layers at its centre.

Native American mysticism and a crazed cult leader spirit desiring to capture Carol Anne are injected into the story of the sequel where we discover that the Freelings were living above a cavern containing the skeletal remains of a group led by Reverend Kane(Julian Beck)proclaiming the end of time was near..seeing that he was wrong, Kane doesn't allow them to leave. Kane and the restless spirits of his cult wish to have Carol Anne back after tasting what life was like with her presence, not ready to go into the light. Kane is now a demon, pure evil, and the Freelings need assistance from a Shaman in order to defeat him. The Freelings' powerful bond of love will ultimately determine their outcome against Kane, The Beast. The special effects sequences almost border on parody, not at all scary, but more unintentionally hilarious, such as when Robbie's(Oliver Robins)braces go amok or when Steve(Craig T Nelson)swallows a possessed worm in a Tequilla bottle, with Kane attempting to use him to harm his family, regurgitating it! This worm starts to grow back into Kane's humanly form! It's quite gross and would perfectly fit in a goofier monster flick, but the POLTERGEIST franchise was supposed to be a more sophisticated horror enterprise, and the remaining sequels just mercilessly ravage what made the first film so good. I couldn't help but wonder what JoBeth Williams and Craig T Nelson felt while making this sequel, an obvious decline in all areas from the first film, from the rather embarrassing plot to the dialogue they are forced to endure. The sequences where the family must go into the other side to stop Kane once and for all just buries the legacy this franchise might've had, but perhaps there shouldn't have been another film anyway. There wasn't lightning in the bottle twice. Heather O'Rourke is still adorable as Carol Anne, Zelda Rubinstein, in a glorifified supporting role, stops by to help the Freelings the best she can(..having delved into the history of what took place in the cavernous dwelling under their house), and Sampson as the Indian shaman is a charming, welcome presence who wishes to bestow wisdom to the family often just confusing poor Steve whose life has fallen on hard times thanks to the spirits which won't leave Carol Anne alone. You have lots of special effects as Kane's supernatural power surfaces when Steve allowed him into the house(..such as an electrical wire and running chainsaw that go berserk)and icky creatures designed by HR Geiger. Geraldine Fitzgerald has a small, but pivitol role as Diane's mother who informs her and Carol Anne that they are all clairvoyant..she serves as a type of protection against Kane. You can just sense that this sequel should've never taken place, merely a cash-in to repeat the success of the far superior original. Kane(..Julian Beck, whose cancer really brings an extra dimension to his character)is quite a memorable menace and this perhaps saves the film from complete crapdom.

The animation is not very good, there were a number of colour changes and very flat backgrounds, and I felt that the animation on Red was a bit too frightening for children. The songs were very pleasant, especially I will always be with you, but not memorable. Then again, neither were most of the songs in the original. I did like the singing voice of Charlie, provided by Jesse Conti, not so much Charlie Sheen speaking-it just wasn't Charlie. Also Sheena Easton was lovely as Sasha; if you want to know a little more about her, she sang A Dream Worth Keeping(FernGully) and Now and Forever with Barry Manilow.(Pebble and the Penguin, which I like more than this to be honest)I loved Mark Watters' incidental music too. I liked the character David, but I found Anne Marie a lot more likable, I cannot watch the end of the first film without getting teary-eyed. Likewise with Carface, Vic Tayback was definitely better, but Ernest Borgnine did a very good job with the voicing I felt, but Carface lacked the calculating manipulation that made him so memorable in the original. Bebe Neuwirth's Annabelle did little for me too, I preferred Melba Moore's angelic interpretation. Now another flaw, and the main flaw, was the story. It was a good idea, with some neat subplots, but it was told way too fast. The studio should have focused on accuracy and detail rather than piling on rushed subplot and another. Now for the main villain Red, a bit too frightening for my liking, but I liked his song, with the Spanish flamenco like rhythms. George Hearn did more than adequately with the voicing,very menacing at times like in his song, but I felt he was out of character. I wouldn't initially associate Hearn with villainous roles. A more inspired choice would have been Tim Curry, as long as they didn't make him do a phony accent that they tend to burden him with. The script wasn't bad, but it did need a lot more work, whereas Borgnine and Dom DeLuise provided the laughs, Sheen and Easton were a little less convincing.

George Hearn did more than adequately with the voicing,very menacing at times like in his song, but I felt he was out of character. I wouldn't initially associate Hearn with villainous roles. A more inspired choice would have been Tim Curry, as long as they didn't make him do a phony accent that they tend to burden him with. The script wasn't bad, but it did need a lot more work, whereas Borgnine and Dom DeLuise provided the laughs, Sheen and Easton were a little less convincing. In conclusion, a disappointing sequel to one of the more memorable Don Bluth movies, but it is not as bad as the Secret of NIMH sequel, which was so awful I didn't know what to say. 6\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family"},{"date":"20 April 2009","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Iconic films within the Western pantheon establish their longevity through contributing a statement to the mythos of the Old West - either reinforcing time worn ideals or challenging and questioning their relevance and true meaning. Far more rare are films such as Don Siegel's The Shootist, which manage to accomplish both simultaneously. One of the least subtly symbolic entries into a genre thriving on symbolism, the film's serving as an elegiac swan song for star John Wayne, paralleling his own aging, dying of cancer and increasing sense of being a relic from a fading era evolves past mere parallelism into an overtly nostalgic tribute to and celebration of Wayne's persona and legacy. Hardly a cinematic triumph as much as a narrative epilogue to a career spanning decades, The Shootist may easily polarize many audience members, incredulously dismissing it as a nauseatingly self-indulgent hull with a virtually nonexistent, leisurely plot a mere construction stuffed with loving winks and self-references (from its retrieval of past co-stars and friends of Wayne's to actually using past footage of his older films for flashbacks) for the sake of giving Wayne one last pat on the back rather than a self-sustaining narrative. And, to be entirely fair, such criticisms are not entirely unwarranted, as the parallels between Wayne (both his cinematic persona and in real life, the overlap cunningly ambiguous) and protagonist J.B. Books occasionally frustratingly bludgeon the audience.Nonetheless, the film redeems itself through boasting a genuinely resonant emotional core and atmosphere of quiet pathos, stoic fatalism and weary reflection. Books' resigning himself to death yet refusing to go out quietly, an icon, having outlived his time fighting to remain relevant (it is immensely unlikely the film would succeed in a cultural vacuum, as the emotional baggage of Wayne's parallelism adds immeasurably to the film's impact) proves enormously affecting, obvious symbolism or not, providing the sort of elegant vehicle for ruminations on age, societal change and challenging heroic preconceptions that fellow genre icon Clint Eastwood would subsequently use to revive the flagging Western genre 15 years later with Unforgiven. Siegel's directorial influence is fittingly less obvious than usual, gracefully abstaining from his usual clipped realism in favour of a lyrical, nostalgic classical Hollywood style more befitting a warm tribute of a film. Yet Siegel's directorial presence is far from swallowed up, instead seizing the opportunity to cap Wayne's career by cannily acknowledging viewer expectations as frequently as his film knocks them down. Siegel takes his time with a leisurely introduction, agonizingly dwelling on Books' age, receding health and pathetic state, as if relishing demonstrating the defeat of the classic Western hero, withering away in solitude. However, after such an unsettling bout of realism, Siegel appears to nod to the essential presence and importance of legends, and, fittingly, fulfills them by refusing to let Books die slowly and quietly but instead forcing him to strap on his guns for one last triumphant showdown. It is with this showdown and Books' inevitable death in a blaze of battle that Siegel asserts his artistic influence the most. As Books falls, the tone of the film, both emotionally and cinematically, changes drastically for its final wordless scene, adapting jittery cameras and kinetic editing, as if physically representative of the 'old days' of film-making falling with Wayne, to be definitively replaced by a newer, edgier cinematic brand. And yet, given the deadened expression on the previously enthusiastic Ron Howard's face, Siegel appears to suggest that there is something ultimately hollow in such a shift, as if laying rest of the time etched black and white values of the Old West in film cannot help but abandon the heart of the medium somewhat as well. Interestingly, Siegel's adherence to classical cinematic style does not prevent him from fully exploiting the film's violent content, pumping his fleeting gunfights with enough spurting blood to give the Hayes code operators of Wayne's heyday heart attacks. As such, Siegel appears to meld both old and new expectations by providing warm nostalgia mixed with brutal, numb, contemporary violence, the odd juxtaposition making both feel all the more unsettling. It is a beautiful bit of nuance echoed by Elmer Bernstein's straightforwardly grand musical score, embracing classical strings and horns and giving the film a boldly vintage feel which equally clashes with its more contemporary aesthetic, as if physically representing the conflict between the old and the new, the romanticized past and unfeeling present. For all the film's shortcomings, John Wayne is truly magnificent in his final performance. Wayne brings a quiet dignity and haunted glaze to his sad eyes beneath the timeless bold grin and bravado voice, a gunslinger tamed and made irrelevant by the forces of nature and societal progress - the two foes he could not outdraw. Refusing self-parody, Wayne is truly magnetic and eerily authentic - a fitting end to a legacy worth celebrating. Lauren Bacall also contributes welcome class, sternness and sombre sympathy, and Ron Howard remains eminently watchable, overcoming the usual 'ethusiastic youth' clichés with sheer energy and guarded self-interest. And, while his small role makes his presence feel somewhat gimmicky, James Stewart gives a delightfully heartfelt and frequently chilling, performance as Books' equally grizzled doctor who has equal experience in the company of death. Stewart's boundless charisma and chemistry with Wayne justify his presence, being consistently memorable and enjoyable. Finally, Scatman Crothers is a welcomely energetic and comical presence, endearingly trading banter with Wayne. While hardly a faultless film, The Shootist's genuine emotional impact and superb performances make its saccharine celebration of Wayne substantially easier to stomach, with Siegel's intriguing directorial touches making for a more nuanced and thematically rich watch. A definitive ending note on the Western (for a time) makes the film essential viewing for fans of the genre or Wayne, as well as any seeking a mature reflection on the counterbalancing of classical values and icons with perpetually moving societal horizons. -8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 April 2009","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Iconic films within the Western pantheon establish their longevity through contributing a statement to the mythos of the Old West - either reinforcing time worn ideals or challenging and questioning their relevance and true meaning.
