It reeks of the 80's (which I love) and I've never really spent any time with Kung Fu films but I have a feeling it definitely channels that demographic of film. American Ninja was a theatrical release back in 1985 and when you watch it now you wonder how that is even possible. Something like this would never make it theatrically nowadays. American Ninja is everything that makes a bad movie so great. Ridiculous stunts, overacting, underacting, and a main cast that THINK they are so bad-ass and completely serious about these roles that you inadvertently find yourself loving every minute of it and investing yourself in these ridiculous macho heroes. The American Ninja series has been on my to watch list for years. Now that I have some extra time on my hands I started it and it was everything I expected it to be. The stunts and special effects are borderline terrible and yet they're doing the best they can with what they're given. The sub-plot of the mysterious origin of Joe Armstrong is sort of silly and unnecessary but I get they're trying to make this as serious as they can and that isn't easy.What can you really say about Michael Dudikoff? He never made it to A-Lister and hardly is a B-Lister. He had no martial arts training at all going into this film which makes him an odd choice. Somehow he's watchable but mostly for morbid curiosity sake. He is so bland and trying so hard to be brooding and serious. He's so bad that he is perfect in this movie. Steve James is awesome. What else can I say? Like Dudikoff, he is awful. He acts bad but he is so high energy and so much more charisma than Dudikoff. They work together though but James is just train-wreck enough to not be able to not like! Judie Aronson is the romantic interest and she is okay but she is there for a single purpose and does that decently. John Fujioka is Dudikoff's mentor and he is quite good but a very small role without a lot of screen time. Don Stewart is an okay villain but this movie desperately needed a really bad-ass villain considering its an 80's action movie.Sam Firstenberg is an expert at this type of movie. His directorial list is a what's what of silly absurd B-Films that I have no doubt he thinks were fantastic. His direction isn't terrible and like I said earlier this might be the perfect homage to the Kung Fu Genre. The story isn't bad, in fact, its simple and straight forward with plenty of action even if that action is ridiculous. This type of film is a whole genre in itself and you have to respect it for that. If you're someone who gets together with friends and watches and the worst of the worst and has a great time doing it then American Ninja should be HIGH on your list.

Sequels like these are exceptionally rare and come only once in a blue moon. In the summer of 1991, Director James Cameron left a long lasting impression on audience with this exciting and visually stunning sequel to the 1984 science-fiction classic Terminator, with Arnold Schwarzenegger in arguably his most iconic role. In this film Terminator 2 Judgement Day, Schwartnegger returns as T-800, a robot sent to the year 1995 to protect John Conner (played by Edward Furlong) the preteen son of Sarah Conner (who he tried to kill in the first film), from a liquid metal shape-shifting robot named T-1000, who intends to kill the young lad. This film impressed me with not only it's incredible storyline and characters, but also with its ground-breaking visual effects that still look great today.Terminator 2 Judgement Day has pretty much everything a science-fiction thriller needs. It starts off with an amazing premise, about a war between humans and robots ruled by Skynet (the film series's main antagonist) that wipes out millions of lives on Earth. The war is the event known as Judgement Day. From there on out, the plot carries on with an amazing story. Arnold Schwartznegger does a magnificent job as T-800, this is probably the best performance of his career. Edward Furlong does a pretty well job as John Conner, especially for his acting role. Then you have Linda Hamilton playing Sarah Conner, John's mother, who is assist John and T-800 on taking out T-1000 (played by Robert Patrick). Hamilton was definitely the best person for her role, she puts some much charisma and emotion into her character, it is amazing. Another thing I love about this was memorable lines such as Hasta La Vista, baby! and I know why you cry, but it is something I cannot do. The most impressive aspect of the film is the visual effects. I love the way T-1000 transforms back and forth from a human into the liquid metal robot he is. The visuals on this are some amazing, especially for a 90s film. What's even more impressive is when he gets his upper body split in half, and instead for blood and guts, what you see inside his body is just metal and looks so realistic. These amazing visual effects make it hard to believe that this film was from the early 90s.Terminator 2 Judgement Day is not only one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made or one of the greatest sequels, but perhaps one of the best films of all time.

Of course, I took my oldest three children to see the first Star Wars flick, Episode IV &#x96; a New Hope, when it came out in 1977. I had seen parts of California Suite in the past &#x96; probably late night TV or something. So, I finally watched this recently on DVD. If most of the 1970s film fodder was like this, I can see that I didn't miss much. (I have watched a few 1970s films that I think are quite good). As a comedy, which I understand it mostly was supposed to be, California Suite fails miserably. The only laughter we get is from Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor. They are two doctors, Willis Panama and Chauncey Gump, who are in-laws and supposedly good friends. They are on a vacation together with their wives, and butt heads throughout in some very funny slapstick scenes. The dramatic and slightly comedic witty part of the film is taken up with Maggie Smith and Michael Caine, both of whom give excellent performances. Smith won her second Oscar playing Diana Barrie, a British actress who was nominated for an Academy Award in the movie. Caine is her husband, Sidney Cochran. Smith's Oscar was one of three nominations the film got, and it's curious that she was best supporting actress to Jane Fonda's Hannah Warren. The two seemed to have the same screen time. Fonda plays opposite Alan Alda as Bill Warren, but he has very few lines. Her part is mostly a running diatribe against everything. First, her ex-husband Bill; second, California and its lifestyle; and third, anything and everything else that comes to mind after that. I'm sure that Neil Simon wanted this to be a funny part in his screenplay, but neither actor does well in their respective roles. Alda is a bland wall off which Fonda's character can bounce her vitriol at break neck speed. Fonda delivers her lines like a robot &#x96; just seemingly spewing some lines she has learned. There's no emotion or even fluctuation in her voice. On the other hand, Simon was a clever writer. So I wonder if maybe he didn't intend her character to come across the way I saw her. She was definitely an itch in the film, and with a b in front of the word, one will have her character down pat. Walter Matthau is OK as Marvin Michaels. We don't see much of his scandal, but his scenes were as much pathos as comedy. Elaine May, who plays his wife Millie, was an interesting role to put in this film. But, I'm glad Simon did it, because we seldom see such characters in movies. She is a character with great character. She knows he's telling the truth when he says he would never do anything to hurt her, and that he loves her. She has the wisdom, and the love and understanding that transcend 90 percent of us most of the time. There would be no sense, no value, and no good in her dumping her husband and fighting him in court. Instead, she can forgive him. I wonder why Hollywood so rarely shows something like this. I sat through this film, expecting that it would get better, but it didn't. The short part with Matthau and May was good, Cosby and Pryor gave some laughs, and Smith and Caine were interesting and very good. All the rest was pretty dismal.

Instead of recycling ideas from the first movie, it expands on the original in a bigger, faster and louder way and the action never lets up for one moment. Mel Gibson is a delight to watch as he returns in the role that introduced him to audiences in a big way.Set several years after the first Mad Max, Australia has been reduced to a post-apocalyptic environment following a global war which has seen the environment now a desert wasteland and supplies of petroleum are scarce following a major energy crisis and a global war which saw the decline of society. A former police officer turned lone drifter, Max Rockatansky(Mel Gibson) roams the deserted highways with his now scarred, black supercharged V-8 Pursuit Special from the first movie along with his dog and a sawn-off shotgun in which ammunition is also very hard to find. Mel Gibson's Max Rockatansky is a world away from the original movie. Here he is a war-weary warrior who has suffered the tragedy of losing his family and is on the brink of losing all humanity in a world in which all hope is lost.The movie starts off with a bang in which Max is being chased by a group of crazed gang members led by the psychopathic Wez (Vernon Wells, also known to many audiences as Bennett from Commando). When Max outwits his pursuers by crashing two of their cars and shooting Wez with an arrow. Wez, though defiant, flees from Max. Max later meets up with a Gyro Pilot (Bruce Spence) in unceremonious circumstances after Max spots a Gyro Copter thinking he could steal the fuel but the Gyro Captain ambushes Max. The Gyro Captain's victory is short lived when Max turns the tables on him and keeps him prisoner. Max and the Gyro Captain come across a small oil refinery kept running by a group of defenders led by Pappagallo (Michael Preston) who have banded together to keep it running. The defenders come under siege when a group of marauders led by the hulking Lord Humungus (Kjell Nilsson), tries to convince the refinery's defenders to surrender the facility in exchange for safe passage out of the area. When a small group of the defenders try to escape they are captured and killed and while Max rescues a mortally wounded defender and brings him back to the compound, with intent to obtain fuel for his car. Max's request for fuel is turned down and at the same time, Humungus terrorises the group and repeats his offer. Max offers to deliver a rig to haul the tanker, the one he found on the road while being chased by Wez, in return for his car and all the fuel he can carry. The deal is accepted. Humungus and Wez plot to kill all the defenders and overrun the compound while Max and the defenders plot to escape with the tanker and their lives which culminates in an exciting, show stopping tanker pursuit.Mad Max 2 joins the ranks of the many sequels that have exceeded the expectations of the original movie, which is often rare. Examples of sequels that have outdone their predecessor include The Godfather Part II (1974), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Aliens (1986), Evil Dead II (1987), Lethal Weapon 2 (1989), Terminator 2 Judgement Day (1991) and The Dark Knight (2008).

The story chronicles his rise to prominence as a 7-8 year-old in the world of chess competition. The eccentric and reclusive Fischer permeates the proceedings, however, as he's constantly referred to and there's even footage of him being interviewed or beating a dozen experts simultaneously, etc. Joe Mantegna and Joan Allen play Josh's father & mother while Ben Kingsley and Laurence Fishburne play his formal and informal teachers respectively.I don't think you need to know about chess to enjoy this film, but it wouldn't hurt. It's primarily a drama and, secondarily, a sports film. Being about chess, it lacks the action of conventional sports films, but it's a sports film nevertheless with its inherent formula. Regardless, I was surprised at how suspenseful they made the final match, which isn't easy to do since chess doesn't seemingly lend itself to cinema.This is a film that'll likely improve on repeat viewings because there are a few interesting subtexts. For instance, Josh's formal instructor and his dad keep trying to mold him into the likeness of Fischer and his misanthropic mindset, but Josh's mother and informal instructor encourage him to be who he is and play naturally. The former two foster rigid discipline and contemptible aggressiveness while the latter two encourage spontaneity and the joy of the game. Perhaps a balance between both is best.Years ago I informally studied chess for a couple of years, reading books and manually performing all the moves, buying & playing computer sets, etc. but I'd only be considered average at best compared to the child players in the film. The reason I bring this up is because, as much as I knew on the topic at the time, I realized I merely touched the surface and that there were whole new realms to explore, learn and master. This is the way it is with any great sport\/art\/topic\/occupation. To truly grasp any one of them and master it to any degree requires serious determination and great sacrifice. You can't be a jack of all trades and expect to be extraordinary in one.The movie also seems to be saying that you shouldn't sacrifice everything else to be a chess master and lose the joy of playing, the joy of living. After all, what good is that? While this is true, it only goes so far and Waitzkin's life since the movie proves it He wanted to do other things than be a chess champion, which is fine, but to do so he had to drop out of chess competition altogether, which he did in 1999. By contrast, Garry Kasparov is considered the most consistent chess champion, holding the record for the longest time as the No. 1 rated player in the world from 1986 to 2005 (two freakin' decades), precisely because of his skill, determination and sacrifices.The movie inspires you to look up the incredible Fischer who reigned supreme in the 60s through early 70s and then dropped off the face of the earth. In 1981 he stayed with grandmaster Peter Biyiasas for four months where he beat Biyiasas seventeen times in speed chess. Biyiasas later testified in a Sports Illustrated interview He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. Bobby honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that. Bobby Fischer never viewed the film, but rightly complained that it was improper to use his name and footage of him without his permission.

What that has to do is with an accident he was involved in that left him, the most powerful man on earth, totally impotent! A fact that would, by losing the womens vote, keep Craig from getting re-elected to a second term!****SPOILERS****The last of the 13 films that Charles Bronson and his wife Jill Ireland were in together with Jill passing away from breast cancer three years later in 1990 at age 54. As you would expect from a Charles Bronson movie you got tons of explosion and action scenes with an exciting motor boat chase that ended with hit-man Eddie Bracken getting his face rearranged. That's when Killon who looked like he was about to get it pull out a surprise from between his legs and it wasn't what you or Bracken would think it is!

But at least they stuck with the main storyline so you can relate. It was tolerable enough that I watched it to the end.Although the Empress in the first movie explained very clearly that Fantasia is made up of wishes and dreams, so the more wishes the better. Then they decided no, wishes are going to eat away at his memories. Hey producers! These movies are supposed to inspire kids to imagine and dream. There was a hidden meaning in the whole wish thing. Instead you make it so the next generation of kids think twice about wishing, dreaming, imagining. Besides, they stole the creatures from Krull.Now here comes #3. This one on the other hand actually angered me it was so bad.1) The father-son relationship was well done in the 2nd movie, now suddenly dad is clueless and married to an airhead? Since dad discovered the secrets of the book from movie #2, it would've been nice if they built on that. But no, he completely forgets everything that happened and is now in LaLa Land.2) Originally the fantasy-reality connection that allowed Bastian to appear in the story was simply a child's active imagination mixed with a few unexplained coincidences in the real world. But he never actually left the attic. Now Bastian can simply talk to the book and teleport like Star Trek? Seriously?3) Engywook and Urgl shrunk even more! Before they were about 3 feet tall, now they're not even 12 inches?4) Falkor #3 no longer tucks his legs in when flying, making for quite a sloppy looking show. It doesn't even look like Falkor. He has a Col. Sanders goatee now. He's supposed to be a Luck Dragon not a Luck Flying Dog. I know he's a dragon that looks like a dog, but he's still a dragon, and should fly like one. At least Falkor #2 looked like #1 and flew like it too. #3 looks and flies more like Falkor's cousin from the trailer park sipping moonshine in between flights.5) The whole Rock Biter (now Rock Chewer apparently) scene should've been cut and burned and buried. This whole sequence by far doesn't even mesh with the rest of the film. If there was any seriousness in the film, this sequence takes it all away and turns it into a kid's Saturday morning TV show. You know those stories of people getting too drunk and waking up with a mysterious tattoo? This is what happens when the Director gets drunk. The kid's watching a cartoon in the wall? They have a Flintstone ATV? Singing Born to be Wild? I need a drink.6) To play the now-grown-up Empress they hired a UK actress who insists on pronouncing Fantasia (fan-tay-shuh) the UK way with an extra syllable (fan-tay-zee-ah). Now don't misunderstand me, I'm all UK myself and am proud of it. But I'm more proud of my theatrical experience and knowledge. And I know that if a significant word in the script (especially a name important to the plot) is pronounced a significant way by everyone involved, you DO NOT go on saying it your way just because you believe it's proper English. That is, if you have any interest in having a lengthy acting career. You can tell by the way she puts emphasis on it several times at her first appearance that she does not care. These mistakes and her arrogance make the character seem like an unintelligent demanding snob. What happened to the sweet and compassionate Empress?7) The Bark Troll sees a tree being cut down and says talk about a chainsaw massacre. This movie is intended for a very young audience. Yet they use a reference to a very graphic adult horror film. Obviously the Director doesn't know how children think. They will wonder what does that mean? if they don't already know, and ask around or look it up. And I'm sure half of those will be curious enough to want to watch it at such a young age.

You get lost, you get delirious, and yes, just by watching the pungent storyline, pungent being the uniqueness, rather aberrant conundrum of the script. The spell gets lost, however, with debilitating performances of the cast, and particularly Piper Perabu (Paulie,) who got awry whenever it came to intense situations. The other actresses (Jessica Pare (Tori), Mischa Barton (Mouse)) didn't have very intense situations so it worked fine with them. Paulie, however, undermined the very serious notion of the movie, and while the script continued to hit audiences with vigor and might, her performance wasn't exactly congenial to it. By the way, Piper now is a wonderful and much better actress now than she was back then, so that's perfectly fine.Some very peculiar elements, like the raptor, the gardener, and the English Literature classes, and the very liberal and open-minded teacher, together with contradiction of thoughts and behaviors, for example, Victoria's recognition of intimacy with Pauline, but failure to go on with her because of family's inclinations, such as personal attitude and religious affiliations, are all very much applicable to real life, so that's a perfect insight of most high-school, and college students. And that's mainly why the movie continues to serve such profound individualistic influence amongst people so well bound under the society as a whole. And practically even, there's no way out, except private affairs, which again, come under the retaliation of conservatives, and thus, individualistic preferences are subdued with extreme prejudice for subcultures and down-the-road likenesses. The point is, Lost & Delirious tremendously inflects on subtle necessities and feelings of humans, and highlights the various turns, U-turns in fact, that cross them all, to simply relinquish possibilities of artificial success. So what it's really trying to say is that human is his own enemy. Artificiality kills the man. Our own traditions, lifestyle choices, cultures, and trends are the biggest traitors. They themselves are swords, which slowly penetrate our minds and senses to deprive us of the very happiness. Pauline, for example, is struck in awe of Victoria, and Victoria knew that her family is orthodox, but she continued the same-sex relationship anyway, but when she feared exposition, she turned away. Such is the impact of societal patterns. And I'm not being judgmental here, mind you, I'm only pointing out to the vulnerability of humans to their own decisions, but that's how it goes, and will for decades, and there's no bettering that. Not everyone is a bloody heretic.I understand that this review is being very unconventional, so much so that you wouldn't call it a review at all, but believe me, the storyline, although lacking numerous editing and refinery skills, is just heart-rending, and deliberately and undeliberately, I'm forced to take this detour, and mostly as a catharsis. It has this conscientious impact on me, and, presumably, on all of us. Lost & Delirious is the perfect vow to castigation of the very phenomenon of tranquility. Mary's dad didn't come to the school function, Paulie got f**ked by Tori, Mouse had blood rushing through her veins (probably from the third party's frolicking,) Miss Fay was over-dramatically sensual in her reading of plays, everyone else were the typical dumb and judgy freaks about how lesbian relationships are stains on society. This among several other things&#x97;probably seven deadly sins&#x97;is what Lost & Delirious devotes itself to. I'm not saying that there was nothing wrong with the movie, there sure was, but everything was in the execution and certainly not in the moralistic aspects of the movie itself. So that's the bottom-line Despite the six, this easily stands as one of the most memorable experiences I've ever had.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"25 June 2015","score":"","review":" The movie follows its intention rightfully, honoring its very title&#x97;Lost & Delirious. You get lost, you get delirious, and yes, just by watching the pungent storyline, pungent being the uniqueness, rather aberrant conundrum of the script. The spell gets lost, however, with debilitating performances of the cast, and particularly Piper Perabu (Paulie,) who got awry whenever it came to intense situations. The other actresses (Jessica Pare (Tori), Mischa Barton (Mouse)) didn't have very intense situations so it worked fine with them. Paulie, however, undermined the very serious notion of the movie, and while the script continued to hit audiences with vigor and might, her performance wasn't exactly congenial to it. By the way, Piper now is a wonderful and much better actress now than she was back then, so that's perfectly fine.Some very peculiar elements, like the raptor, the gardener, and the English Literature classes, and the very liberal and open-minded teacher, together with contradiction of thoughts and behaviors, for example, Victoria's recognition of intimacy with Pauline, but failure to go on with her because of family's inclinations, such as personal attitude and religious affiliations, are all very much applicable to real life, so that's a perfect insight of most high-school, and college students. And that's mainly why the movie continues to serve such profound individualistic influence amongst people so well bound under the society as a whole. And practically even, there's no way out, except private affairs, which again, come under the retaliation of conservatives, and thus, individualistic preferences are subdued with extreme prejudice for subcultures and down-the-road likenesses. The point is, Lost & Delirious tremendously inflects on subtle necessities and feelings of humans, and highlights the various turns, U-turns in fact, that cross them all, to simply relinquish possibilities of artificial success.

Of course, the big numbers in this film include Astaire dancing with a hat rack, which only goes to prove he could make any dance partner look good, as well as the famous number where Astaire dances on the walls and ceilings of his London hotel room. The trick here, well known by now, was that the room was actually set up to rotate. What is wondrous about this scene is that Astaire never seems to have any trouble keeping his balance as this rotation is going on. He just looks like someone who is so much in love he is just jumping with joy from floor to wall to ceiling and back. Less mentioned is the number where he dances with Jane Powell on board ship in choppy waters as furnishings roll about, but it is also a charming piece of choreography.The plot is fairly simple. Astaire and Powell play a brother and sister song and dance team, Tom and Ellen Bowen, both of whom claim to be against any long-term romantic entanglement. They are invited to perform in London during the period preceding the wedding of then Princess Elizabeth to Prince Philip. While in England they both fall in love, leading to a happy ending for both but breaking up the partnership in the process. It's rather interesting that art loosely imitated life in this case, since Fred Astaire's long-running dance partnership with his sister Adele was ended when she got married to a member of the English nobility in 1932. It's also strange that this film was actually made four years after the royal wedding took place. By that time the royal couple already had two children. As for good supporting performances, Keenan Wynn is quite funny playing twin brothers who are theatrical agents on opposite sides of the pond. They can't understand each other during their telephone conversations because, although both are speaking English, they are using the familiar expressions of their respective countries.From a technical standpoint, this film may either be in rather rough shape or completely restored if you see it, since it spent a long time in the public domain before Warner Brothers restored it in 2007.

I can handle moments of flawed movie logic, but this film features way too many of these occasions to retain credibility.If you're prepared to unplug your brain and personally enjoy this type of film, then there may be something of interest. For everyone else &#x96; there's nothing of value here to enjoy.

He settles on a semi-furnished guest house belonging to a married couple by the name of Cliff Forrester (Kurtwood Smith) and his wife Liv (Gwynyth Walsh). Also there is their 14-year-old daughter Adrian (Alicia Silverstone) who immediately develops a crush on Nick. Since he is twice her age he figures that her attraction to him is nothing serious. Big mistake. Anyway, as far as this film is concerned it pretty much follows the standard format of any number of similar movies made both before and after. However, what distinguishes this one is the performance of Alicia Silverstone in her very first film debut. Likewise, both Jennifer Rubin (as Amy) and the afore-mentioned Cary Elwes also performed quite well too. Again, the story is pretty formulaic but even so I thought it was still enjoyable. Accordingly, I rate this movie as slightly above average.
