It was released in 1973 and was produced by Arthur P. Jacobs, directed by J. Lee Thompson, and written by John William Corrington and Joyce Hooper Corrington. It stars Roddy McDowall, Claude Akins, Natalie Trundy, Severn Darden, Lew Ayres, Paul Williams, and John Huston.This movie is a sequel that I do believe requires the viewer to watch Conquest of the Planet of the Apes before watching this film. You'll be able to enjoy it however even if you haven't seen the other movies, but there will be some unanswered questions if you are not familiar with the other Ape films.It's been nine years since the events of Conquest of the Planet of the Apes - Due to so many Ape-uprisings, as well as a nuclear war among humans, the Apes have taken over the world. In a place called Ape City, under Ape leader Caesar's leadership, all Apes have learned to talk and speak English, as well as do many other things. Almost all human beings have been enslaved by the Apes and are kept to serve their needs.Caesar and his human friend MacDonald desire for the Apes and humans to live in peace. However, a militant gorilla named Aldo believes the Apes should become more strict on the humans and that all humans are evil and violent by nature, and must be punished for all their past crimes against Apes. Aldo plots with the other Gorillas to carry out justice.Meanwhile, a group of radiation-scarred human rebels who live amongst each other out in the desert, far away from Ape City and any Apes, and are lead by a crazed, Ape-hating fanatic named Kolp, have plans to invade Ape City, rebuild society, and put the Apes back into slavery. What will happen when two civilizations go to war and battle for control of the Earth?Like the previous Ape films, this one is also anti-racism, and is full of political, historical, and social parables. For example...In Ape City, the Apes (of all ages) are getting educated on a variety of topics such as reading and writing by going to a school taught by a white human man schoolteacher. Because there are no Ape teachers, and because the more intelligent Apes are too busy doing other things to help build the city, Ape leader Caesar had no choice but to bring on a human teacher to do the job of educating the other Apes in basic things such as reading and writing. The school is the final and only place where a human has any type of authority over Apes. There is a moment where the schoolteacher inadvertently says to Aldo - No, Aldo, no! - This is met with shocked silence by everyone - Apes and humans. It turns out one of the first laws enacted in the new Ape civilization was that no human may say No to an Ape. The reason being is because a long time ago when Apes were learning how to be slaves to humans at a place called Ape Conditioning School, one of the things Apes were forced to do was lay down on a table while being electrically shocked over and over again while a recording of a human saying the word No was repeated on a speaker. This was done so that the Apes would learn to fear the word No. And when an Ape became a slave to humans, if an Ape did something wrong, their human masters would shout No and that quickly put the Apes in an act of fear and submission. Humans said No so much to Ape that is scarred the Apes emotionally, and now, in this new society where Ape rules over Man, a human's right to say the word No to an Ape is a highly offensive crime. The year was 1973 when the film was released, which was around the same time Whites and Blacks started going to school together, so I thought the issues in the classroom scene were touching on the topic of the tensions that were going on in schools all across the U.S.A. There's also a scene where Kolp and the mutant humans invade Ape City via a school-bus, which was symbolic of the time when Whites and Blacks were being bused together. The bus is indeed a very symbolical item to appear in the film, and I think the presence of the bus subconsciously reminded audiences of the racial tensions going on in their very country, and gave the scene a more creepy atmosphere for audiences since actual acts of violence were going on, and a school-bus was largely connected to all of it. This is a film that does not tell you who the heroes are or who the villains are, and suggests to you that you think for yourself. When I first watched this movie, I honestly did not know who to cheer for. One of the reasons why I like the film is because it doesn't really pick a side. It let's the viewer have his or her own opinion, and doesn't really tell you who to root for. The film respects it's viewers intelligence.Characters like Aldo and Kolp are both faces of rebellion. Dark faces. Characters like Caesar and MacDonald are the light faces of rebellion. But all four characters are indeed rebels who are against the system, and in most cases, it's always the system that is the true villain. What is the system in the Planet of the Apes films? - Tyranny.All and all, I enjoyed Battle for the Planet of the Apes very much. It is wonderful, and entertaining.

Nothing can ever compare with those movies, as they were made at a certain time - a sequel, prequel, or remake could NEVER duplicate those movies, no matter how good they were.That being said, obviously I was not alone in my excitement over the news that 3 prequels being released. I never thought I'd see that day as a child, but they were now coming. Even then, I remember telling people that no matter how this movie is, it's never going to be in the same pedestal as parts 4,5, & 6. Never.Naturally the movie came out and with it, the complaints. Complaints after complaints from supposed fans, the closed-minded, and just general complaints (ie, the movie was racist - it was not by the way).Some of the complaints are definitely warranted Jar Jar Binks was a very annoying character and ruined most scenes, though I know why Lucas put that character in the movie. Binks was probably the worst thing about the movie. Even in repeated viewings, I still can't bring myself to like the character, but it is what it is. I didn't care for the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi, but they're in the movie and there's nothing I can do about it. The Binks complaint is pretty universal among most people and I agree.I've also heard complaints about the pod racing scene. I personally didn't care for that scene either, as it was a little long and probably the most boring part of the movie. It could've been trimmed down some and still have the intent Lucas had in mind.Remove those 2 complaints from the movie and really, the movie wasn't bad. Jake Lloyd was a bad casting for Anakin, but the young Darth Vader was a kid after all and certain behaviors are obviously understandable. The lightsaber duel was good (though it's funny that the duels in these 3 movies are a lot better than the duels in the original - but as with the way things looked, there are explanations for that as well). The droid battle could have been a little better, but it was really no more hokey than the Ewok battle in Jedi. The space battle was not as good as the original (and neither were the unlikable pilots for that matter), but you have to start somewhere. I didn't care for the Gungan scenes much either, but this is also something never in the originals. The movie in general and as a whole was still good enough to be a 'Star Wars' movie.I do think that this movie was under pressure and that people expected something along the same lines as the original, but it was not going to happen, no matter what Lucas did or didn't do. We were getting new characters (the 3PO\/R2 scene was forced obviously) and not getting the characters and universe fans fell in love with in the original trilogy. This was a different time, both in the movie and when the movies were being made with an older George Lucas. Sure, the movie could've used some improvements, but that's obviously not happening now. I can watch this movie still and enjoy it. Sure, it's the worst out of the 6 movies, but when watched objectively, it's not that bad of a movie and probably gets a bad rap now more out of habit from some people. Definitely watchable for any normal Star Wars fan in my opinion(whether you nitpick or not).

It could've been trimmed down some and still have the intent Lucas had in mind.Remove those 2 complaints from the movie and really, the movie wasn't bad. Jake Lloyd was a bad casting for Anakin, but the young Darth Vader was a kid after all and certain behaviors are obviously understandable. The lightsaber duel was good (though it's funny that the duels in these 3 movies are a lot better than the duels in the original - but as with the way things looked, there are explanations for that as well). The droid battle could have been a little better, but it was really no more hokey than the Ewok battle in Jedi. The space battle was not as good as the original (and neither were the unlikable pilots for that matter), but you have to start somewhere. I didn't care for the Gungan scenes much either, but this is also something never in the originals. The movie in general and as a whole was still good enough to be a 'Star Wars' movie.I do think that this movie was under pressure and that people expected something along the same lines as the original, but it was not going to happen, no matter what Lucas did or didn't do. We were getting new characters (the 3PO\/R2 scene was forced obviously) and not getting the characters and universe fans fell in love with in the original trilogy. This was a different time, both in the movie and when the movies were being made with an older George Lucas. Sure, the movie could've used some improvements, but that's obviously not happening now. I can watch this movie still and enjoy it. Sure, it's the worst out of the 6 movies, but when watched objectively, it's not that bad of a movie and probably gets a bad rap now more out of habit from some people.

Nothing can ever compare with those movies, as they were made at a certain time - a sequel, prequel, or remake could NEVER duplicate those movies, no matter how good they were.That being said, obviously I was not alone in my excitement over the news that 3 prequels being released. I never thought I'd see that day as a child, but they were now coming. Even then, I remember telling people that no matter how this movie is, it's never going to be in the same pedestal as parts 4,5, & 6. Never.Naturally the movie came out and with it, the complaints. Complaints after complaints from supposed fans, the closed-minded, and just general complaints (ie, the movie was racist - it was not by the way).Some of the complaints are definitely warranted Jar Jar Binks was a very annoying character and ruined most scenes, though I know why Lucas put that character in the movie. Binks was probably the worst thing about the movie. Even in repeated viewings, I still can't bring myself to like the character, but it is what it is. I didn't care for the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi, but they're in the movie and there's nothing I can do about it.

Audiences were disappointed by the film, thinking they were ripped off because Season of the Witch was not a 'Halloween' movie. John Carpenter and Debra Hill left the series and went on to do other things and effectively the Halloween series was dead.Over the next few years the slasher film was officially cemented into the annals of cinema history. And so it was that in 1988, ten years after Halloween created this subgenre of film, Moustapha Akkad secured the rights to the franchise and decided to cash in on the genre that he helped create. On October 21st, 1988, Halloween 4 was released. The first Halloween was original, scary, and well made, the second was well made and fun and the third was original and different. Halloween 4 pales in comparison, not only to the three films that came before it but to many of the imitators that followed in the original Halloween's wake.Right from the beginning of this film things just seemed off. The credit sequence done so effectively in the first three is gone. Instead we get shots of barns, and painted skulls and windmills with the sun setting behind it. Sure it sets the mood of the halloween season, but it isn't very Halloween.Once the story kicks in, we find that Michael Myers and Dr, Loomis didn't die at the end of part II, they were just horribly burned, and Myers has been lying in a coma for ten years. Laurie is dead, and her daughter is living with family. And so Myers awakens to go after her while Loomis chases after him.The acting in Halloween 4 is by far the worst of all the four films. Ellie Cornell, the female lead, is rather stiff and stilted and Danielle Harris, who plays Laurie's daughter Jamie, is a great screamer and can show fear rather well, but when it comes to crying and other emotions she just falls apart.Donald Pleasance is the only returning actor and as usual his performance is rather good but as a viewer one can't help but feel sad for him every time he appears. He puts so much into his role and loves the character but everything else around him is so badly done that it becomes depressing watching him. Take Michael Myers for example. While a terrible force of evil in the first film and a gruesome killing machine in the second, here he is rather lame. Not only does he move differently (no awkward and eerie head movements) but he just doesn't seem that imposing. He is seen mostly in full frame shots with lots of light and thus he just isn't that scary. What made Myers so scary to begin with was his ability to become one with the shadows.And the deaths in this film are pretty lame. They take place off screen for the most part, which seems to be a deliberate attempt at recreating the feel of the original. But in the original, Myers only murdered three people and although there was not much blood and gore, all three deaths were seen on screen in glorious terrifying detail. Here you don't see the deaths, instead the film-makers either cut away from them or a character stumbles upon them long after they were killed.The direction by Little is terrible in this movie. The editing is poor and the cinematography is weak. Gone are the glorious widescreen shots of Dean Cundey, only to be replaced by unintentionally shaky and bland shots with generic lighting and poor framing. The editing is choppy and doesn't flow well and the film, although only 88 minutes and the shortest in the series, ends up feeling a lot longer than it's predecessors.And although Halloween III had a lot of plot holes, part 4 makes it seem like an Oscar winner. Sure Myers can do some incredible things; find people when he should have no idea where they are; drive a car with out learning how to; but in this movie Myers has become something more. Now Myers can appear in one part of town in one scene and in the next he can be in a completely different part of that town. He appears anywhere where the story needs him to be with no regard for logic. And when Loomis is looking for the schoolhouse, in Haddonfield of all places, he needs help, even though he has been there before.After 7 years of waiting for Michael Myers to return to the big screen, he finally does and boy oh boy does he disappoint. There are very few good things to say about this movie. The best thing about it is the Halloween theme by John Carpenter, and even that isn't heard enough. Donald Pleasance puts his all into the role but is let down by everything around him and the gore and nudity (now an almost requirement in the slasher films) is virtually non existent. Even when the opportunities arise to deliver the goods, they never happen. From the opening frame to just shy of the last minute, Halloween 4 disappoints. Then in the last minute, a twist arrives. It's rather interesting, it's cool, it's original and it opens up room for a rather original sequel. Other than that, Halloween 4 is a disaster, a mess and a complete waste of time.

Set in 1927, a movie studio decides to pull the production on a silent picture and convert it to sound. The lead star (Gene Kelly) is fine with the idea but the only problem is that the leading lady (Jean Hagen) doesn't have a good speaking voice. After a disastrous preview screening, the idea gets launched that they should dub the actresses voice with that of someone who can sing and speak (Debbie Reynolds). SINGIN' IN THE RAIN just had its 60th Anniversary re-release and it was quite something getting to see it on the big screen but what's even more remarkable was the fact that the film made it this long. It's funny to know that the film was only a moderate success when it was first released and I wonder what the Kelly and company would have thought at the time if people would be gathering sixty years later to watch the film, which is certainly one of the most loved of all time. Even though everything in the film is a major success, I think it's fair to say that Kelly deserves most of the credit since he not only played the lead but he also co-directed, came up with the dances and helped with just about every part of the picture. The work Kelly does here is just remarkable and especially considering how many terrific moments there are with just the singing and dancing alone. The title track and dance is one of the most memorable, charming and joyous in film history but we also get classic takes with 'Make Em Laugh,' 'Good Morning' and the closing big number, a take on 'The Broadway Melody.' Not only are these sequences terrific but so is the main story as it works perfectly well as a throwback to the day when musicals really took off. The stuff dealing with Hollywood's transition from silent to sound rings especially true and leads to some terrific jokes and some very funny moments. Of course, it goes without saying but the entire cast is terrific with Kelly leading the way with a very strong performance in the lead. Reynolds is also very good as the virginal new star and Donald O'Connor gets some terrific moments with his laugh out loud funny performance. Hagen deserves a lot of credit for the high-pitched dumb blonde who can't do anything right. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is clearly one masterpiece that really lives up to its high reputation. It really doesn't matter how many times you've seen it, the magic lives on each repeat viewing because the dancing, the singing, the mood and the performances are simply so good that it's impossible not to get drawn into the material.

Not only are these sequences terrific but so is the main story as it works perfectly well as a throwback to the day when musicals really took off. The stuff dealing with Hollywood's transition from silent to sound rings especially true and leads to some terrific jokes and some very funny moments. Of course, it goes without saying but the entire cast is terrific with Kelly leading the way with a very strong performance in the lead. Reynolds is also very good as the virginal new star and Donald O'Connor gets some terrific moments with his laugh out loud funny performance. Hagen deserves a lot of credit for the high-pitched dumb blonde who can't do anything right. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is clearly one masterpiece that really lives up to its high reputation. It really doesn't matter how many times you've seen it, the magic lives on each repeat viewing because the dancing, the singing, the mood and the performances are simply so good that it's impossible not to get drawn into the material.

Victor Frankenstein, the character became Henry Frankenstein. He went from being a scientist obsessed with defeating death to become a mad scientist. In the book has no Fritz, is a childhood friend Henry Clerval who will study in Ingolstadt with Victor, but he does not help Victor to create the creature. In the movie has no Captain Robert Walton. In the film the creature gains the brain of a murderer, and demonstrates a demented personality. In the book it is very smart and articulate, interested in literature and becomes smarter than Victor Frankenstein himself. The film shows the creature have at most 6 feet tall. In the book it has 8 feet tall. In the film the creature has a big head with boring hair licked touching the forehead, and bolts (or metal plates) strung around his neck. In the book it has longs hair, many scars by stitches (reminiscent of a patchwork mat), yellow skin, but no metal parts. There are so many glaring differences between the film and the book that if I make note of fidelity to the film would be a note below zero. But after seeing that there are about 200 films about Frankenstein, and the only faithful adaptation is a production made for TV by Hallmark in 2004, I decided not to tear the film because of loyalty. But watching the film as film. And honestly ... there is no way to praise this garbage. Well, I saw many reviews saying that despite all the difference between book and film, the film maintains the concept of the original work. You really sure that read the same book as me? The concept of the book is not the insanity of the human being, but the old quarrel between science and religion about what we are. Religion says that God made \u200B\u200Bus perfect, and with scientific advances in the late nineteenth century, Mary Shelley was horrified to see that things like galvanism could incite the mind to believe that science would be approaching the secrets of God. Despite coming from an atheist family, including her own husband Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley put the book details of her own personal life, which included a modest belief in God. The main concept of the book is to show that even with all the scientific advances, venturing into the unknown and play God may have a painful price. About the movie, the acting is basically what they were in the '30s, more theatrical than realistic, and this is not a problem. The problem is the way James Whale as rough guides the story. With moments that could very well be in a film of black humor, and others that could be basically a horror movie of its generation. It suggests that all this was done without intent. Boris Karloff's acting is good, but in the final scene in the windmill where the creature screams because of the flames, he seems a little girl (with all due respect). Now tell me, a monster with a mind deranged and murderous screaming like a girl? And the happy ending? What's that? Excuse me, but if James Whale did something really great in his career, this thing was the sequel of Frankenstein The Bride of Frankenstein. I can not say more because I maxing out characters, but is more or less the impression I got to see this piece of crap! PS Although the Branagh version is not faithful to the book (although some parts are faithful) it's very better than James Whale version in movie aspect.

Kumalo eventually finds Absalom and his pregnant girlfriend--but also that Absalom's being charged with murdering a young white man (Jarvis) who was very active in helping blacks and opposing apartheid (apartheid translation = aparthood).The film is based on Alan Paton's VERY influential 1948 novel of the same name (& banned in South Africa for many decades). Paton's book helped foster civil rights changes in the USA as well as the many diplomatic pressures that pressured an end to apartheid (1948-94) in South Africa. Cry, the Beloved Country has been published in 20 different languages; 1 Broadway play & 3 films have been based on it. ((For those interested, the cliffsnotes study guide for Cry the Beloved County has an excellent, quite succinct (IMO) history (1600-2000) of the dynamics & conflicts of the various ethnicities, races, nationalities, etc., that led to apartheid and its dissolution http\/\/www.cliffsnotes.com\/study_guide\/literature\/cry-beloved- country.html))Paton was a devout Anglican (AKA Episcopalian in the USA) South African who strongly opposed apartheid as did a number of other South African people and denominations (e.g., Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist, etc.; but altogether, these denominations were a political minority).While the film narrative closely follows Paton's book, for some (IMO), it will be more interesting as a glimpse back at those times rather than as a highly interesting story apart on its own. The plot is essentially a modern day morality play in which 2 major protagonists the black Rev. Kumalo represents conflicts of Christian ideals and human feelings vs. the wealthy white landowner's, Jarvis's father (Harris), desire to preserve apartheid (aparthood=segregation) but with his own conflicts. A significant, slightly lesser figure is the Rev. Kumalo's brother who takes a political, NON-religious stance (opposed to his brother's faith-based position) exhorting blacks to oppose & subvert privileged whites who keep blacks permanently disenfranchised and in extremely inferior status.Paton's book also served as the basis for Kurt Weill's & Maxwell Anderson's Broadway musical Lost in the Stars (it ran 1949-50; '58; '72; I saw it & loved it). The stage musical simplifies the novel's plot but adds Weill's great music and Anderson's great dialog while staying very true to Paton's book.((There's also a 1974 AFT film version of this musical. It's not so much like traditional Hollywood musicals in which narrative actions pause for singing since, in this, the songs seem so integral to the narrative's development. And SOME emotional interactions are more intense (IMO) than in the '95 Cry, the Beloved Country film. BUT in this musical film version--inexplicably, sadly--the concluding emotional reconciliation between the two fathers who lost their sons (in the book, the stage version, and this film) is quite diminished and almost totally absent.))Paton's book (& its derived Broadway musical) helped provide impetus for American civil rights marches (1950s-60s) in which many other Episcopalian college students & I participated--so seeing this film brought back many stirring and fond memories.My ratings 10 (of 10) for its representation of this era's events and the book but 7 (of 10) for entertainment.

Kumalo\/Jones) in 1940s apartheid South Africa searches for his son, Absalom, who'd gone to Johannesburg and stopped contacting his family. Kumalo eventually finds Absalom and his pregnant girlfriend--but also that Absalom's being charged with murdering a young white man (Jarvis) who was very active in helping blacks and opposing apartheid (apartheid translation = aparthood).The film is based on Alan Paton's VERY influential 1948 novel of the same name (& banned in South Africa for many decades). Paton's book helped foster civil rights changes in the USA as well as the many diplomatic pressures that pressured an end to apartheid (1948-94) in South Africa. Cry, the Beloved Country has been published in 20 different languages; 1 Broadway play & 3 films have been based on it. ((For those interested, the cliffsnotes study guide for Cry the Beloved County has an excellent, quite succinct (IMO) history (1600-2000) of the dynamics & conflicts of the various ethnicities, races, nationalities, etc., that led to apartheid and its dissolution http\/\/www.cliffsnotes.com\/study_guide\/literature\/cry-beloved- country.html))Paton was a devout Anglican (AKA Episcopalian in the USA) South African who strongly opposed apartheid as did a number of other South African people and denominations (e.g., Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist, etc.; but altogether, these denominations were a political minority).While the film narrative closely follows Paton's book, for some (IMO), it will be more interesting as a glimpse back at those times rather than as a highly interesting story apart on its own. The plot is essentially a modern day morality play in which 2 major protagonists the black Rev. Kumalo represents conflicts of Christian ideals and human feelings vs. the wealthy white landowner's, Jarvis's father (Harris), desire to preserve apartheid (aparthood=segregation) but with his own conflicts. A significant, slightly lesser figure is the Rev. Kumalo's brother who takes a political, NON-religious stance (opposed to his brother's faith-based position) exhorting blacks to oppose & subvert privileged whites who keep blacks permanently disenfranchised and in extremely inferior status.Paton's book also served as the basis for Kurt Weill's & Maxwell Anderson's Broadway musical Lost in the Stars (it ran 1949-50; '58; '72; I saw it & loved it).

While The Exorcist was scaring folk back into churches, The Wicker Man was doing the opposite. Both films saw foot-soldiers of Christ attempting to save little girls from supposedly demonic forces, but with The Wicker Man you're practically invited to root for Christ's fail.Like many films of its era (even such innocuous ones as Kramer vs Kramer), The Exorcist was an unconscious reaction to a bevy of changes rocketing across American society. Though marketed as shocking and new, these films typically put forth very conservative messages, attempting to restore a pre-counterculture order in which daddy is boss, children don't swear, mommy doesn't work, sex and science are bad and everyone believes in God.The Wicker Man, of course, is a British film, so (like Ken Russell's The Devils, released 2 years earlier) you get a slightly more pessimistic take on the period. Unlike The Exorcist, which might have well been a Vatican propaganda piece, our religious hero here is a prudish chump called Sergeant Howie. Howie's shown to be completely impotent, incompetent, dies in a flaming pyre, is not miraculously saved by God, and the film's bad guys are the kinds of superstitious, religious nut jobs who were presented as the good guys in The Exorcist. Their religion founded on an radical abstinence from sex, yet overflowing with a repressed sexuality in which phallic symbols are worshipped and little boys sing songs about impregnating women, the film's religious cult represent a kind of demented patriarchy in which God and Daddy protect villages from drought and misery, providing you remain steadfastly devoted to all things phallic.Directed by Robin Hardy and starring Hammer Horror legend Christopher Lee, The Wicker Man is today regarded as a classic of British horror. Its climax in particular is one of cinema's great sequences it's a creepy, memorably directed set piece in which Howie confronts a religious cult. Slowly and slowly the sequence mounts, Hardy's imagery becoming increasingly bizarre (men in dresses, animal costumes, pagan dancing, giant wicker statues) such that it eventually creates a kind of ontological shock. I believe in the life eternal as promised to us by our Lord, Jesus Christ! Howie repeatedly yells, as he's cremated alive, Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ! But God doesn't answer. The film ends with a kind of reversal of the Spanish Inquisition, our religious hero revealed to be as fanatical and psychotic as that which he denounces, sacrificed as a heathen by heathens themselves.Decades later The Wicker Man would be remade by Neil LaBute, who has made a career writing stories which play with, wallow in, reverse and test sexist, racist and classist stereotypes. With The Wicker Man (2006) he throws out the original's patriarchal cult and replaces it with matriarchal communes and rampant misogyny. In LaBute's hands Howie then becomes a character played by Nicholas Cage, an apparently noble, self sacrificing cop. Meanwhile the pagan cult is revealed to be a matriarchy where women run things and men serve only as manual labourers. Much of the film takes deliberate swipes at both feminism and femininity in general, with school girls literally chanting phallic symbol! and laboratories filled with jars of dead foetuses. Women, the film says, use their control over human reproduction to keep men out of the loop, stupid and at their feet. They are scheming, cruel and devious, and adept at using man's protective instincts against him. This is all encapsulated by an early scene in which Cage picks up a child's doll on the highway after it has flown out of a car window. He pulls the car over and hands the doll back to its owner a rude little girl who reveals herself to be ungrateful. Later Cage risks his life to save the girl from flames (foreshadowing his own fiery encounter late in the film). Masculine nobility, the film says, is co-opted by the evil inherent to females. You bitches! You bitches! Cage spends the second half of the film screaming, his masculine weapons, status as a police office, fists, technology and bravado unable to hold back the might of womanness.While the film says women are a loose commune of praying-mantis-like feminist harpies who lure men into their web, use their sperm (literally) and then burn them alive in big wicker cages, LaBute also seems to suggest that much of this lady-hatred is something already latent in Cage. The film itself may be Cage's &#x96; recently burnt by an ex lover - sexist fever dream. Though denounced as being misogynist, the film seems (but not necessarily; I dare not watch it again to find out for sure) to be portraying the exaggerated, worst fears of a misogynist (Cage) and the worst case scenario of extreme feminism. Of course most of LaBute's plays and films (Fat Pig, Some Girls, Reasons to Be Pretty, Company of Men) are implicitly about abuse, and attempt to critique rampant sexism. These critiques mostly backfire, though at least LaBute is an equal opportunity offender, oscillating between films in which whites abuse blacks, blacks abuse whites, fat people abuse skinny people and vice versa, women abuse men and men abuse woman. There's something systematic about LaBute's projects, successive films and plays deliberately presenting the opposite of that which went before (consider the way race relations are reversed in Lakeview Terrance and Death at a Funeral).Regardless, LaBute's remake is horrendous. LaBute's not a strong visualist and much of his film is unintentionally funny, though not silly enough to be enjoyably camp.8\/10 - Though dated and poorly paced in some sections, the original The Wicker Man is worth watching for its climax.

Disney isn't gutsy enough. To be honest, I still don't know how this got into theaters. Disney scarcely ever makes a film as subtly dark as this. On the surface, Pinocchio is a typical Disney children's film, but underneath, Pinocchio boasts a variety of dark themes that work like a charm. It's a shame Disney will likely never make something like Pinocchio again, because it's just so good.Pinocchio is a very strange story. Even stranger than I originally anticipated. Geppetto, a wood carver, was quite pleased when he was finished with his wooden puppet, Pinocchio. He was even more pleased when it turned into a real boy. And with Jiminy Cricket as Pinocchio's conscience, what could go wrong? Well, a lot. Temptation proves too much for Pinocchio, and, without spoiling anything, he gets into a lot of trouble.Part of what makes Pinocchio such a great movie is the characters. Geppetto is a mumbling wood carver who cares a lot for Pinocchio, and is easily excited. Jiminy Cricket, one of Disney's most enduring characters, makes many humorous quips that aimed more at the older crowd. And Pinocchio? He's certainly adorable, but his frequently obliviousness between right and wrong may grow tiresome to some viewers.There are a few songs in Pinocchio, as one would expect from a Disney film, and while all are pleasant, there aren't too many memorable tunes. Naturally, the most memorable (and most recognizable) tune is When You Wish Upon A Star, which is a sweet and beautiful song that, unlike the other songs in Pinocchio, has become a genuine classic, and well deserved too.One memorable scene occurs towards the beginning when the many clocks in Geppetto's house go off at once. There are many sight gags, all of which should evoke chuckles. It's moments like this that really make Pinocchio a treat.The animation in Pinocchio surprised me. Even for today, the animation is really sharp and detailed. It's certainly one of Disney's more visually dazzling adventures.I mentioned early in this review that Disney would never make a film like this nowadays, and this is because of some of the slightly questionable themes. One of which occurs near the end where children are kidnapped and taken to an island where they are turned into donkeys, whipped, then sold into slavery. This may seem slightly disturbing, and it is, but it works.If only Disney still made risks like that. Instead, they often take the predictable path that, while can be sweet sometimes, more often is disappointing.Pinocchio is a unique Disney film that is better than almost anything Disney has served up in the last decade. It's a shame Disney isn't brave enough to do things like Pinocchio these days. With memorable characters, one of the most enduring Disney songs of all, and a lot of heart makes up Pinocchio One of Disney's best creations.
