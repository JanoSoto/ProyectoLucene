[{"date":"12 April 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Robert Altman has assembled a perfect cast, as usual, to tell a slow-moving tale of denizens of a sleepy southern town. Cookie's Fortune refers to Patricia Neal (Cookie) who lives with Charles S. Dutton (Willis) as her aide and confidante. The other characters, and I do mean characters, are the members of her family. Her niece is Glenn Close (Camille) who is fantastic as the most idiosyncratic of her relatives. Julianne Moore (Cora) portrays another family member subtly. She will be one of the great actresses of the coming years. Liv Tyler is Amy, Cookie's grand niece. If this sounds complicated, it is. But don't worry, it all comes together in the end. Other fine performances come from Ned Beatty and Chris O'Donnell as local sheriffs. Altman, as usual, has his eye on characterization rather than plot. However, his setting of the mood and the magical relationship between Cookie and Willis, and Willis and Amy are the warm core of the film. Count on Altman to have a few surprises in store, even though he sort of runs out of steam toward the end.

I was moved to tears several times in this beautiful production spear-headed by the talented Robert Redford.  Again he has created Art at its finest.  An amazing cast - Indelible performances that will stay with me for years to come.  Thank You Robert Redford...I now remember why I love the medium of Film and Film making.

Marisa Tomei is winning and occasionally light-headed as Faith Corvatch, a woman intent on finding her soulmate, Damon Bradley.  Robert Downey Jr., not my favorite human being, nevertheless does well in the role of Peter Wright.  Often overlooked is the performance of Bonnie Hunt as Faith's sister-in-law, who at first runs away from, but finally overcomes, a crisis in her marriage.  Even when shown in such a fluffy film, it's nice to see Hollywood portray a dissatisfied wife who, when presented with the real chance to have an affair, still manages to remain true to her husband.
