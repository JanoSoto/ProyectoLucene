It also shows that friends really do stick together, through thick and thin. With the three leading ladies in roles that are really well written, here is a classy 'chick flick', that one guy really likes. It also looks into what it means to be sick, which I have been no stranger too, either....Three women sharing a car going west, team up in this winning celebration of camaraderie, caring and friendship which quickly becomes a family, in 'Boys on the Side'. One is a wisecracking club singer, one is a finicky real-estate agent and one is a free spirit. Each has secrets to reveal, strengths to impart and vital moments of self-discovery awaiting. Now is their time.What a fine cast for such a dramatic movie. The three main girls in 'Boys on the side' include the 'lesbo' Jane (Whoppi Goldberg), Robin (well acted by the talented Mary-Louise Parker), who is being helped to drive across America by Jane, and the fun loving and partly liberated Holly (Drew Barrymore). All these women are amazing in their roles.I love how Jane stands up for herself and her sexuality, in addition to the fine music she can sing. Robin is a girl hiding a big secret, but we are aware that her life has not been an easy ride, which seems ironic, because of what the movie shows. Then what Holly is enduring, is quite staggering, being involved with a brutal man, Nick (Billy Wirth), that no woman should have to put up with. It is Holly's great personality and character that turn these best friends into a very close-nit family. Her situation is not as easy as it seems either.While men are not talked about in a very good light in the film, we do see some men that are decent to these women. Robin admits to having a thing for barman, and on the road trip she meets up with Alex (James Remar) a caring barman, who is really hooked on Robin. The way their relationship goes is an interesting aspect of the movie. James had an interesting character in HBO's 'Sex and the city'. Holly, with such a bubbly personality meets a cop cutely named Abe Lincoln (Matthew McConaughey). He dearly loves Holly, wants her as his wife, so she can live a life that can be happy and trouble-free. I am interested in seeing McConaughey's latest film, titled 'How to lose a guy in 10 days'.The director of BOTS was Hebert Ross (from the brilliant 80's movie, Steel Magnolias). He is a very game sort of director, and does not shrug away from any of the important issues within the film. I love how he brought out the movie's main themes of sex and sexuality (gay and straight), the empowerment of women, friendship, sickness, humour and what it means to be a family.But the movie's story was also a highlight from where I viewed it. Written by Don Roos, it was very touching and emotional, but also holds a large amount of subtle, clever humour. The way he wrote the three main characters was terrific, with them all having very different situations for us to learn about. This I believe allows us to fall in love with each one of them. The use of quick flashbacks is another aspect that was well written into the screenplay by Roo's as were some of the lines in BOTS, which are unforgettable. Lines like when Holly asks Robin at the dinner table, `We're you?' in reference to her and Jane having a sexual relationship, the next few lines are great. The title of the film was well thought up, considering the line that Robin's mother says to her daughter, `You can't fight nature, God knows you women keep trying, treating your men like side dishes, stick a fork in when needed, just like men used to treat us.' That line is basically what the film is all about.Another great part to this film was its soundtrack. It was not only clever to incorporate it via one of the movie's characters, that of Jane, it makes the whole movie all the more compelling. Whoppi Goldberg and Mary Louise Parker sing a fine solo of the Roy Orbison classic, 'You got it'. Then for the movie to have another performer actually sing the song, I found to be just original, as some films would just throw in the old song, but not here. Another ironic part of the soundtrack is a song written and sung by known lesbian Melissa Etheridge, titled 'I take you with me'. I am sure that the powers behind this movie wanted such a performer, considering one of the main characters in the film was also gay.I watched this film, just a few weeks after seeing a movie that I am sure inspired the writer of the script, that being 'Thelma and Louise'. Parts of 'Boys on the side' has a similar feel to 'Thelma and Louise' - that of women on a road trip, trying to break free of men's hold on them. While a lot of the film is original, it has a very touching ending, to what can only be described as a very emotional movie. I also feel that director Herbert Ross, allows us to experience what each character is going through in life and does not shrug away from any issues that other movies might simply try and avoid. With a cleverly incorporated soundtrack, 'Boys on the side', is a movie that we can all learn from, to try and improve not only our friendships that we have, but how we live our lives in a world that can be cruel, harsh and unfair.CMRS gives 'Boys on the side' 4 (Very Good Film)  ","genre":null},{"date":"19 May 2003","score":"19 out of 26 people found the following review useful","review":"  'Boys on the side' is a very touching movie that looks essentially at what it means to be a woman, trapped inside a man's world.

Famous for movies such as Beetlejuice, Batman and Edward Scissorhands, Burton brings an 18th century story to the screen as only he can. It also has much more, with great special effects and a subtly humorous script. Then to round this movie off, it has one of Hollywood's more hunkier guys in the lead role, who I am sure the girls cannot resist, that being Johnny Depp. It is the year 1799 and in the isolated hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, murder most foul has occurred. Three corpses have been found, each killed instantly, all decapitated. Visiting constable, Ichabod Crane, suspects one of the villagers is responsible, but the locals believe the killer is not one of their own and most definitely not of this world.There is a lot to like about this movie. The look of it is truly amazing, as nothing was left to the imagination in creating the town of &#145;Sleepy Hollow'.  The people who were given the task of recreating the life and times of such a place did a remarkable job in making &#145;Sleepy Hollow' seem incredibly creepy. Another highlight was the use of special effects to enhance the story all the more. The character of the &#145;headless horseman' and other little bits and pieces, make &#145;Sleepy Hollow' an even greater visual experience.With all that being said, Tim Burton put his delicate touches to the film and made it very well. Being &#145;hands on' and very relaxed off-screen, Burton would have been great to work for on this film. It is also very obvious that Burton was apart of the film, as the dark, gothic look of the film has to be his idea. In this instance it helps make the film even greater.The screenplay for the story is quite incredible. Not only is game enough to show a very gory type of villain, it has a hero that is quite eccentric, with all his gadgets, gismos and personality. Then to round it off we have some character that I would call &#145;different', but in a very good way. I also like the &#145;tongue in check' humour that was placed within the story and the action sequences which give the movie its variety. The &#145;Sleepy Hollow' screenplay was very well written by Kevin Yagher.Johnny Depp is the remarkable 1800's character of Ichabod Crane in the movie. Depp recreated the feel of the &#145;horror film acting' just nicely. I had to agree with his description of his character from a featurette on the film though. He said that his character on the &#145;outside' seemed very masculine and strong, yet on the inside he was like a &#145;pubescent girl'. We get to see him many times act like a girl would, fainting, and covering up in a bed, being really scared. I also like how this character makes himself look like such a fool at many intervals, which he does only because he wants to get the job he is working on done. Under Depp is a fine amount of talented actors. These include Katrina (Christina Ricci) who was a fine looking woman in the film. The evil Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) is one character that I was not expecting to be who she was. You have also got to be impressed with how dastardly a character that &#145;Hessian Horseman' (Christopher Walken) was. It is ironic that Walken plays a character in this movie, considering that his character in the 1983 movie, &#145;The Dead Zone', refers to the Sleepy Hollow story. He looked so evil when had his head attached to his body, a true credit to the make-up department. There are many other fine actors in supporting roles in the film that I really liked, but unfortunately cannot talk about.There many parts to this movie that I liked. All the scenes which involve the &#145;de-heading' of many of Sleepy Hollow's town-folk are gory kind of events, but done in such a way that you just have to like. (The effort behind-the-scenes to make this part of the film is truly amazing!) To start the movie the way Burton did was a nice touch. Yet seeing the Headless Horseman go around on his horse was another part of the film that I find incredibly refreshing, as he is different to what we would normally see in the movies. The Horseman's resting place is another creation I find so original, and makes the movie even more surreal and horrific. Then top the movie off, you have the exciting action sequences which left me breathless. The musical side of Sleepy Hollow was also a highlight and had Tim Burton being reunited with composer Danny Elfman from Batman. He did a fine job in bringing out the movies more thrilling moments, with his orchestral cast which he assembled just wonderful. Sleep hollow has a lot to offer to its viewing audience, as it has something for every kind of taste. Themes such as action, horror, humour (comedy), thriller and drama are all within this movie and are used to great affect. One quote I can remember hearing about the film I feel suits it, that being `it's really brutal, really physical, a really intense movie.' As you will see I was close to giving this movie 5 on my movie rating system (the CMRS), but there is only one downfall to it, and that is the disturbing references to the supernatural and witchcraft. I found them a bit hard to take, but I guess having a &#145;headless horseman' in one of the lead roles, it was inevitable that those themes would be in the movie. Nevertheless, I still find myself in true admiration for a movie that was game enough to do many things, that even I had thought were not possible.

I also like the &#145;tongue in check' humour that was placed within the story and the action sequences which give the movie its variety. The &#145;Sleepy Hollow' screenplay was very well written by Kevin Yagher.Johnny Depp is the remarkable 1800's character of Ichabod Crane in the movie. Depp recreated the feel of the &#145;horror film acting' just nicely. I had to agree with his description of his character from a featurette on the film though. He said that his character on the &#145;outside' seemed very masculine and strong, yet on the inside he was like a &#145;pubescent girl'. We get to see him many times act like a girl would, fainting, and covering up in a bed, being really scared. I also like how this character makes himself look like such a fool at many intervals, which he does only because he wants to get the job he is working on done. Under Depp is a fine amount of talented actors. These include Katrina (Christina Ricci) who was a fine looking woman in the film. The evil Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) is one character that I was not expecting to be who she was. You have also got to be impressed with how dastardly a character that &#145;Hessian Horseman' (Christopher Walken) was. It is ironic that Walken plays a character in this movie, considering that his character in the 1983 movie, &#145;The Dead Zone', refers to the Sleepy Hollow story. He looked so evil when had his head attached to his body, a true credit to the make-up department. There are many other fine actors in supporting roles in the film that I really liked, but unfortunately cannot talk about.There many parts to this movie that I liked. All the scenes which involve the &#145;de-heading' of many of Sleepy Hollow's town-folk are gory kind of events, but done in such a way that you just have to like. (The effort behind-the-scenes to make this part of the film is truly amazing!) To start the movie the way Burton did was a nice touch. Yet seeing the Headless Horseman go around on his horse was another part of the film that I find incredibly refreshing, as he is different to what we would normally see in the movies. The Horseman's resting place is another creation I find so original, and makes the movie even more surreal and horrific. Then top the movie off, you have the exciting action sequences which left me breathless. The musical side of Sleepy Hollow was also a highlight and had Tim Burton being reunited with composer Danny Elfman from Batman. He did a fine job in bringing out the movies more thrilling moments, with his orchestral cast which he assembled just wonderful. Sleep hollow has a lot to offer to its viewing audience, as it has something for every kind of taste. Themes such as action, horror, humour (comedy), thriller and drama are all within this movie and are used to great affect. One quote I can remember hearing about the film I feel suits it, that being `it's really brutal, really physical, a really intense movie.' As you will see I was close to giving this movie 5 on my movie rating system (the CMRS), but there is only one downfall to it, and that is the disturbing references to the supernatural and witchcraft. I found them a bit hard to take, but I guess having a &#145;headless horseman' in one of the lead roles, it was inevitable that those themes would be in the movie. Nevertheless, I still find myself in true admiration for a movie that was game enough to do many things, that even I had thought were not possible.

Famous for movies such as Beetlejuice, Batman and Edward Scissorhands, Burton brings an 18th century story to the screen as only he can. It also has much more, with great special effects and a subtly humorous script. Then to round this movie off, it has one of Hollywood's more hunkier guys in the lead role, who I am sure the girls cannot resist, that being Johnny Depp. It is the year 1799 and in the isolated hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, murder most foul has occurred. Three corpses have been found, each killed instantly, all decapitated. Visiting constable, Ichabod Crane, suspects one of the villagers is responsible, but the locals believe the killer is not one of their own and most definitely not of this world.There is a lot to like about this movie. The look of it is truly amazing, as nothing was left to the imagination in creating the town of &#145;Sleepy Hollow'.  The people who were given the task of recreating the life and times of such a place did a remarkable job in making &#145;Sleepy Hollow' seem incredibly creepy. Another highlight was the use of special effects to enhance the story all the more. The character of the &#145;headless horseman' and other little bits and pieces, make &#145;Sleepy Hollow' an even greater visual experience.With all that being said, Tim Burton put his delicate touches to the film and made it very well. Being &#145;hands on' and very relaxed off-screen, Burton would have been great to work for on this film. It is also very obvious that Burton was apart of the film, as the dark, gothic look of the film has to be his idea. In this instance it helps make the film even greater.The screenplay for the story is quite incredible. Not only is game enough to show a very gory type of villain, it has a hero that is quite eccentric, with all his gadgets, gismos and personality.

I stick to those words! Paul Schrader has always been a good director of unflinching bravery. He tackles the toughest subject matters head on! Here we have a story about Wade Whitehouse (Nolte) who is the sheriff of a very small New Hampshire town and gets no respect from anyone in his life. He's divorced and gets to see his daughter part of the time. He's also a hard drinker and smokes pot on the job. But he's also the victim of a very brutal childhood at the hands of his monster of a father Glen (James Coburn). Wades mother is found dead in her bed and Glen cannot acknowledge it. Wades brother Rolfe (Willem Dafoe) comes for the funeral and Rolfe also acts as the films narrator as he lets the viewer in on little details about they're upbringing. Wade has a girlfriend named Margie (Sissy Spacek) and she seems to genuinely like Wade but as the film continues we see her growing tiresome of the situations with him. What is fascinating about the film is watching Wade try not to become his father. Nolte is a big guy and is usually the biggest thing on screen but Coburn is enormous. With about 40 extra pounds of padding, Coburn dwarfs Nolte. We can understand why he is afraid of his father. One of the things that stand out in this film as I watched it is the location where it was shot. The cold and snowy New Hampshire setting is the perfect bleak landscape for a story with bleak characters. There is a subplot about an accidental shooting on a hunting trip that Wade investigates and ends up being about real estate and when Wade uncovers this it erupts a false confidence in himself and he thinks that when he breaks the story people will finally respect him. I didn't care to much about this part of the film because the main point of the film is Nolte and Coburn and this is what the story is really about. Also, Wade has a nagging toothache and it represents his past that will not go away and is slowly driving him crazy. *****SPOILER ALERT***** The end of this film is haunting and powerful as we see Wade become his father Glen. We know its going to happen and I think Wade knows it also but seems to be powerless to stop it. Margie finally has had enough and leaves Wade and when he tries to talk to her his daughter thinks he's attacking her and she flails at him. When his daughter has finally turned her back on him he reacts with violence, like his father would have. Wade gets rid of his father the same way he got rid of his tooth, with a blunt instrument. Coburn is so menacing and cruel that its a wonder that Wade didn't react this way earlier. Nolte is just riveting and his beaten gruff exterior is perfect. The scene where he pulls out his own tooth with a pliers is haunting. Its a tough film to watch but the performances and the no holds barred script make this a film that just can't be forgotten. Nolte didn't win an Oscar for this role but he should have. He's never been better and never will be again. Very powerful film.

It was playing in a holiday resort cinema at the time.  A real run of the mill movie by the time I seen it, so even though I was so young and on my own, it was ok to go in and watch it.  I ran out of the cinema and back to our apartment when I seen the head scene.  I had nightmares for weeks afterwards.  Since then I've seen this classic countless times and I enjoy it every time.  There's just something about the atmosphere in the film that I find infectious.  The casting is the most natural I've seen. Each of the main characters is so believable, different and interesting in their own way.  A tired middle aged cop from New York, a young rich scientist in love with his work, and an old weather beaten shark fisherman with scars to remember most of his encounters. I've yet to see interaction like this between 3 actors. The love\\hate atmosphere on the boat is just gripping. I bought the DVD version for my kids.  I'd rather the original because in the DVD version in the scene before they sing; `Show me the way to go home', the whale sound effect is smudged out and replaced with a more 90's politically correct whale sound.  I thought the original effect added much more to the atmosphere of the film.  But it is cool to see it digitally touched up.  And what about the Score?  Is there a more memorable score for a movie?  Space Odyssey 2001 springs to mind but even that masterpiece borrows from the classical world.  That music was not written for that film. I loved the book too, but I have to say the movie is better.  I know it's strange but it's true.  I love movies but I've yet to get the same level of enjoyment from a movie as I did from Jaws.  And that includes E.T., Close Encounters, Star Wars and so on.  Jaws is a marvel. I'm glad I was so young when I first seen it because it probably wouldn't have had the affect on me that it had had I watched it at an older age.

Directed by Australia's Peter Weir, it is a movie that is good for young impressionable teenagers to watch and learn what poetry can do for people, whether they are struggling to write, falling in love or are inspired by someone who has done something in the past that they want to revive all over again. Although, parts of this movie could be called 'clichéd', it is a movie that I will continue to refer to, for a longtime to come.When charismatic English professor John Keating arrives at a strict boys academy, his unconventional teaching methods breathe new life into the curriculum steeped in tradition. With his wit and wisdom, Keating inspires his students to pursue individual passions and make their lives extraordinary. Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society has touched audiences and critics alike with its brilliant acting, uplifting story and superb craftsmanship.What a joy this movie is. Director Peter Weir directed it in such a style that I really liked. It was interesting to learn that Weir was willing to do things a little different, which I feel is ironic, considering that is one of the story's main themes. Weir also sounds like the kind of guy that kept inspiring his cast to be as 'good as they can'. I feel that Weir's improvisations only enhanced the picture all the more.However, the story of the movie also needs to be applauded. Written by Tom Schulman, who won an academy award for his work, he wrote a really inspirational story from where I viewed it. But it was also much more. It had interesting characters, both young and old, with the Mr. Keating just terrific. Yet the themes of DPS are also important. They include 'seize the day', 'standing up for yourself', 'facing your fears', the traditions of conservatism and that conforming is not the best way to live your life. The movie gives all these aspects good attention, and all are important, especially in the DPS's young lives.The cast of DPS was also well chosen. John Keating (Robin Williams) is a fine teacher, although he does things just a little bit different. Sure he was a rebellious student in his young days, but as an adult, he has a charismatic style and past that helps inspire the main group of boys in the movie. One of my favourite scenes in the movie has to be when Mr. Keating tells all his poetry class to rip out, 'Mr. J. Evans Pritchard's introduction titled 'understanding poetry'. Keating calls it 'excrement'. Then when a passing senior teacher sees the ripping of books going on, he is flabbergastered, thinking that foul play is going on.I also liked the young members of the cast, who restart the 'Dead Poets Society'. They include Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), Todd (brilliant acted by Ethan Hawke), Knox (Josh Charles), who is infatuated by a pretty girl called Chris (Alexandra Powers), Charlie, aka Nwanda, (Gale Hanson), Richard (Dylan Kussman), Meeks (Allelon Ruggiero) and Pitts (James Waterston). All these boys are different, some funny, some sad, some trying to workout what they are. But via the reinvention of the DPS, they all use the phrase 'seize the day' to change their lives, for their better and\/or worse.Yet some of these characters find it hard to live up to expectations of traditional school or their parents. Neil has a very rocky and difficult relationship with his father (Kurtwood Smith) and goes to drastic measures to be rid of the problem. The way Neil deals with his problems might seem the easy way out, but when a bad situation seems inescapable, desperate people can do desperate things.Then the problems that we see confronting Todd are also important lesson to learn from. The scene which involves Todd getting up in front of the class to recite a poem was terrific and shows how big of an effect Mr. Keating is having on such introverted student. He knows Todd can be a brilliant poet, he just needs the confidence to bring it out. A friend said that it was ironic that Hawke played the role of a struggling writer, considering that in real life he is a writer, having some works published.The good parts behind the scenes of DPS include the great sets that were used. I especially like the school grounds used for 'Welton Academy', as it gave me the distinct impression that we are introduced into a proud boy's school. Music was also put to good use in DPS, with the playing of bag pipes creating great tension and emotion for the film. I believe it continues on that feel of tradition that accompanies such a school like that of the 'Welton Academy'. The music was composed by Maurice Jarre and sound done by the late Allan Splet.'Dead Poets Society' might not be everyone's idea of a 'good movie', as some will look at it and say 'that has all been done before, in a much better way'. However I am one person whose game enough to say that this is a pretty good movie in all of the aspects I have mentioned. The conclusion to the movie is really powerful in my opinion, and shows to the audience that these boys have respect for their teacher and that they have taken the steps to be able to 'seize the day'. I read Roger Ebert's review for DPS, and felt he was very harsh on the film, and disagree with his 'not enjoyable movie' tag, as it was thoroughly enjoyable from where I viewed it. I first watched 'Dead Poets' at school many years ago, which was the perfect place to do so, as it will make students, like I was, inspired to be whatever they want to be someday.

He has to return home to his mother deep in the Louisiana woods, where he and his mother share a house with a donkey who drinks out of the toilet.  His mother is so happy to have Bobby home, but Bobby would like to be working.  Eventually, he finds a group desperate enough to take him--the SCLSU football team, which has a 40-game losing streak, a pathetic loser of a coach, and one assistant coach who wears overalls  (always with one strap broken) and speaks what sounds like gibberish but could be Cajun.Bobby gets little respect from the players at first, and though he's used to being taunted, something finally snaps and he tackles one of the players.  Coach Klein is so impressed that he talks Bobby into playing for the team, though Bobby doesn't believe his mother will let him.  The coach visits the Boucher house for a meal where the main course is snake, and when he asks what's for dessert, a blue flash comes from outside and the answer is 'Squirrel'.Mama Boucher will not let her son play 'foozball' (like just about everything else, it is of the devil), but the coach figures what she doesn't know won't hurt her.  Bobby has a number of challenges, including the fact that to play he must go to class.  While we don't see much of that, Bobby does manage to make a fool of himself, and he forgets he's only supposed to tackle football players.  Bobby also doesn't know much about football.  Eventually, though, he proves to be everything the team needs to succeed.  He also gets romantically involved with a beautiful ex-convict named Vicki (Mama doesn't approve, naturally).In all of the Adam Sandler movies I have seen except 'The Wedding Singer', Sandler has played a likeable loser with a temper who has obstacles to overcome, and I enjoy watching these Sandler characters.  The only difference with this movie is that he has a Cajun accent and he stutters.  Sandler's temper, though, is less pronounced here and he has to be pushed into getting mad.  This movie makes good use of 'morphing', or turning people Bobby is supposed to tackle into someone he is mad at.In addition to Sandler, Kathy Bates gives a good performance, especially in the second half.  Jerry Reed is good as Bobby's former coach, except toward the end when he turns into a cartoon character. The sportscasters covering the Bobby Boucher story are convincing for the most part, but they turn silly by movie's end.  I also enjoyed two ignorant fans that stood out from the crowd, the coach with the language problem, and the SCLSU football player with the number 51 whose name I don't recall hearing.The music, while not my taste, is definitely above average for this type of movie.  The mix includes Southern rock, Americana, and something that sounds like reggae but could be popular in Louisiana.  There's also party music which has nothing to do with the rest of the styles, but the college students like it.Yes, it's silly, and not particularly realistic.  The ending was exciting but could never happen in real life.  But it was a funny, feel-good movie anyway.

I can see how you might be sucked in to thinking the latter was a good film if you hadn't encountered one in a while. But if you HAD seen anything good immediately beforehand you'd wonder how this obsessive bludgeoning of the viewer with acts of twisted nastiness could even be mistaken for good art. Isabelle Huppert's performance? Admittedly she does keep us watching, keep us following her to see where she'll go...Spoilers follow.We start by watching a piano teacher who's at once very good and very bad mercilessly cruel (in creative ways, so that nobody is ever really prepared) to her students, she holds a respected post because she is, after all, talented, and her insults are painful precisely because they're backed by knowledge and even, musically speaking, wisdom. Her cruelty is enough to make her a genuine monster, just as her mother's cruelty to to her is enough to make HER a genuine monster.

The movie did surprisingly well at the box office, and critics and audiences have been raving about it, so I was wondering what all the fuss was about.  This is definitely not your standard teen slasher.  First of all, I admire the choice of focusing on two characters.  As the two characters are developed, we became quite attached to them, and when we finally see them in peril--we care!!  Often in these types of movies, we're faced with an ensemble of characters, who are each one-dimensional.  So instead of clenching onto the edge of our seats, hoping they don't die, we're actually waiting to see how they get killed.  But in this case, the characters are well-developed and they're brother and sister.  This way there's no cheap, gushy romantic moments.  The two of them love and care for each other, but not in a romantic way.  The acting is good.  Yes, I'm discussing a horror movie and admiring the acting.  This is no misprint.  The two lead actors each express great emotion, and we really feel their terror.  The movie has a unique approach, because it's intelligent and clever, yet it doesn't go for camp.  This campy horror approach sometimes works, but there's so many of these types of films that the line between horror and comedy is beginning to get blurred.  There are self-referential moments, like when Darry goes into the pipe and his sister says, You know, this is one of those moments that they show in scary movies where the character does something stupid and everyone hates him for it! and when she runs over the killer and Darry asks, Is he dead?  She replies, They never are, and continues to run him over a couple more times.  For all this time, I've been waiting for characters to really give it to the villain, completely making sure he or she is dead, and that moment has finally come.  So I thank Victor Salva for that.  But these moments aren't done with a heavy hand.  The film has spurts of comic relief, but all in all it treats the horror genre with seriousness and respect.Jeepers Creepers isn't perfect.  There is some annoying dialogue and I wanted to know more about the killer's motives, but other than that this is a solid horror-thriller.  And I admire the ending, which also isn't standard in the horror genre.  Salva, who directed the poignant drama Powder, is truly a talented director and hopefully he'll be recognized for his talent and not for his past as a sex offender.

But thanks to a movie brought to us by director Alan Parker, called &#145;Mississippi Burning', I was not only able to learn about such big events in one of &#145;America's big town' histories, I was also able to appreciate how bad it &#145;turned' some people in this world. While &#145;Mississippi Burning' might have some aspects that will disturb some people, it is a &#145;gritty police drama' that I feel cannot and should not be missed.1964 Three young civil rights workers - two white, one black - disappear on a dark Mississippi back road, sparking off one of the largest FBI manhunts in history. Two FBI agents, with very different backgrounds, join forces to solve this seemingly impossible case, a case that ignited a controversy so bloody, it shocked the world.   &#145;Mississippi burning' is a wonderful movie that recreates a time in America's history, a history I am sure that the country would rather forget. Yet I feel it is important that we learn about such historical events, as we can learn from the old times and how they have changed our life. &#145;MB's' story was extremely well written by Chris Gerolmo. What I liked most about it, was how game it was in showing the really confronting issues that I am sure were part of Mississippi in &#145;1964'. At no stage does it shrug away from any disturbing issues, including such ideals as the KKK, the media hype in Mississippi and the important investigation that both Anderson and Ward want to solve. But director Alan Parker, brought out the stories great tension particularly well. I also feel it is Parker's unique directing style that allows us, as the audience, to see what is going on in Mississippi burning. Such tensions as the racist's ideals of the KKK, the way the media are consumed by the investigation of the missing civil rights workers and even the different ways both Ward and Anderson do their job, are all very memorable points from the film and this is the good work of Parker. The start and end of the film I feel are Parker's delicate touch as director, beautifully done and will be sketched in my memory for a longtime to come.    Yet the acting talent in the film is also of a great highlight here. The main performers are agents Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Ward (Willem Defoe). Both are great in the roles that they played, but both are very different personalities, which cause them problems on the job. This only adds to the movies great tension. I mean it is easy to tell that both officers want to get to the bottom of this important case, but do it in such different ways. One goes by the book, getting in many hundreds of men to crack the case, while the other wants a smaller investigation, walking the town of Mississippi upsetting town folk, all in the aid of justice. I love the chemistry that Hackman and Defoe shared onscreen considering that both are playing opposite characters, as their relationship is vital to the final makeup of the film. Hackman's true acting talents come out here, however before seeing Defoe in &#145;MB', I felt that he was an ordinary sort of actor, but in this film he has proved to me he has some acting ability. Yet the supporting cast was also of the highest quality. Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand) is great in her role. She is a person that is cared for by Agent Anderson, which is another great part of the movie's story, and is a pivotal character in the investigation. With Mrs. Pell, you get the feeling that she hates not only her life, but what is going on in Mississippi, with her quote that she sobs to Anderson about hatred, just captivating.She is married to corrupt cop, Deputy Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), who has a smug smile and is not the greatest of policeman. Dourif's character is involved in one of the more tense scenes of the movie, when Anderson threatens him while being in the barber shop, a favourite of mine. Other good members of the supporting cast include Clayton Townley (Stephen Tobolowsky), Frank Bailey (Michael Rooker), who is brought to his knees by Anderson and Mayor Tilman (R. Lee Ermey). Other interesting scenes in &#145;Mississippi Burning' include the events that show the three civil rights boys being harassed by the cops, you have all the media hype created by the FBI investigation which was great, and the racial tension created by the KKK and their hatred towards the black people of Mississippi, with the burning of one black family's home, quite disturbing. The motel scene is very dramatic, and shows that these two agents are in a very dangerous situation. The diner scene is another truly remarkable scene to see being played out. It is hard to believe that white and coloured people had such big divisions, like this movie shows.Look &#145;Mississippi Burning' is a repugnant sort of movie at time, and could make you feel rather sick, considering that this movie's story is based on true events, making it difficult watch. However, this film makes me happy, considering that I live in a country that has democracy, an important ingredient in these times of multiculturalism. The music of MB is really thrilling, chilling and dramatic, and makes the movie's story even better. I feel that MB deserves all the praise that it gets, and it is no wonder that it had so many nominations for academy awards, winning one (for its cinematography by Peter Biziou). If you are looking for a really dramatic and entertaining movie then &#145;Mississippi Burning' is the movie that I highly recommend for you.CMRS gives &#145;Mississippi Burning' 5 (Brilliant Film) ","genre":null},{"date":"19 May 2003","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I was never aware of how big an effect such a movement like the &#145;KKK' had on America, even the world.

It is hard to believe that white and coloured people had such big divisions, like this movie shows.Look &#145;Mississippi Burning' is a repugnant sort of movie at time, and could make you feel rather sick, considering that this movie's story is based on true events, making it difficult watch. However, this film makes me happy, considering that I live in a country that has democracy, an important ingredient in these times of multiculturalism. The music of MB is really thrilling, chilling and dramatic, and makes the movie's story even better. I feel that MB deserves all the praise that it gets, and it is no wonder that it had so many nominations for academy awards, winning one (for its cinematography by Peter Biziou). If you are looking for a really dramatic and entertaining movie then &#145;Mississippi Burning' is the movie that I highly recommend for you.CMRS gives &#145;Mississippi Burning' 5 (Brilliant Film) ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"19 May 2003","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Miss Vida Boheme (Patrick Swayze) and Miss Noxeema Jackson (Wesley Snipes) are the proud winners of a New York Drag Queen contest.  After the event they bump into Miss Chi Chi Rodriguez (John Leguizamo), who is very upset that she hasn't won the contest.The two drag queens are convinced to take Miss Chi Chi with them to compete in the national drag contest however; their prize for winning the local one was only two plane tickets to Los Angeles.  They decide to give up their plane tickets and travel by car so the three of them can go.On their way to Los Angeles, they encounter Sheriff Dollard (Chris Penn), who pulls their car over because one of their rear lights is out.  When he asks to see Miss Vida's license, she obviously tries her best to get out of it without having to show the license, bearing in mind the name on her license is Eugene and drag wasn't exactly an acceptable thing in Middle America back then.  The officer takes Vida to one side and starts trying to get fresh with her, believing she is a real woman.  When he reaches up her dress and grabs a hold of her manhood, he suddenly finds himself shocked and flat on his face unconscious in the middle of the road.The three get out of there pretty quickly as they do not really want to face the wrath of an embarrassed sheriff who is sure to want to arrest Vida for rendering him unconscious.  They manage to get a little further until their car breaks down.  Now they are stuck and their only way forward is for Chi Chi to try and hitch a ride.A nice young lad, Bobby Ray (Jason London) pulls up to pick up Chi Chi at the side of the road and is quickly convinced to take her two friends with him too.  He takes them back to his home town, a very small town where everybody knows everybody.They meet Carol Ann (Stockard Channing) who allows them to stay with her and her husband Virgil (Arliss Howard), who is planning on fixing their car however, it will take a couple of days to fix it because the parts are not easy to get hold of.   So now they are faced with a very small town of people, who believe they are real women and they have to keep the act up for three days.  Who knows what kind of reaction they will get if they are found out.Sheriff Dollard is soon on the hunt and is determined to find them and bring them back dead or alive to prove to his fellow officers that they were really men in dresses and he wasn't knocked out by a woman.  He starts his search and it will only be a matter of time before he does eventually find them.Whilst staying at Carol Ann's place, they discover she is the victim of regular domestic abuse, at the hands of her husband Virgil.  After tolerating it for a little while, Vida decides enough is enough and fuelled by the nasty comments thrown at her in an argument with young Chi Chi, she decides to do something about it.  Virgil is thrown out; Carol Ann is now able to be herself and the four start to build a friendship.It doesn't take long for the rest of the town to join in and soon enough, the whole town has been brought together by these three mysterious girls that just appeared.This film is wonderful.  It puts out a message to the whole of the world about how drag queens should be accepted as ordinary people and how everybody in their own right should be able to dress how they like, see who they like and be who they like.  It shows that anyone, no matter how they chose to dress or who they chose to sleep with, can do good and bring people together.Patrick Swayze is relatively funny and surprisingly quite good in drag.  Wesley Snipes is amazing in his role, very funny, very witty and fantastic in drag.  Stockard Channing shows once again that her acting skills are never wasted and plays a very important part in the film and John Leguizamo portrays the part of young Chi Chi very well.This film is one not to be missed.  It is funny, meaningful and educational.  It's well made and even quite moving in some parts.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone!

This is the case of Harold (Bud Cort) in the film, `Harold and Maude.' Known as a cult classic, `Harold and Maude' is a film that transcends its time with a daring love story between a young man between the ages of 18-20 and an elderly woman nearing the age of 80. The film is reminiscent of the story of `Auntie Mame' in that despite its dark comic approach, `Harold and Maude' is in fact a celebration of life and the eccentricities that make every person unique.  \tThe story follows that of young Harold (Cort), a rich teen who constantly fakes suicide perhaps to gather attention from his mother, a shallow socialite who has no comprehension of her son's afflictions. One of Harold's favorite past times is to attend funerals, where in fact he meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), an elderly woman whose peculiar behavior leads her to steal cars, among other things, and to appreciate life beyond what the average person does. The two meet at a wake and become close friends. Maude teaches Harold the importance of life beyond the norms by seeing the beauty and intrigue that exists and every object that inhabits this earth. The two generate a connection that ultimately leads to love, and makes Harold question his own wants in life with a family and society that are too conventional for his tastes.  \t `Harold and Maude' isn't just a love story; it's a dark comedy. One can't help but laugh how Harold's phony suicides are portrayed. From stringing himself up in a noose to pretending to chop his arm off, Harold thinks of anything that will shock and disturb his mother. But to his chagrin, nothing works. What's more, the actions of the unusual Maude of stealing cars and fooling police officers, it will leave anyone giggling.  \tAside from its whimsical nature, `Harold and Maude' is relatively bleak as it deals with issues such as death and suicide. Similar issues were raised by a recent theatrical release, `The Hours,' which followed the story of three different women, in three different time periods who were all profoundly affected by Virginia Woolf's novel, `Mrs. Dalloway.' In one scene of `The Hours,' Woolf's husband asks her why someone has to die in her book. Her answer, `Someone should die in order that the rest of us appreciate life.' That's basically the message that one receives from `Harold and Maude,' as well. Death is a part of life although upsetting and sometimes unfair, it happens.

This is the case of Harold (Bud Cort) in the film, `Harold and Maude.' Known as a cult classic, `Harold and Maude' is a film that transcends its time with a daring love story between a young man between the ages of 18-20 and an elderly woman nearing the age of 80.

The two meet at a wake and become close friends. Maude teaches Harold the importance of life beyond the norms by seeing the beauty and intrigue that exists and every object that inhabits this earth.
