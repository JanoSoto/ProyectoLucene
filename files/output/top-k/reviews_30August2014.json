And it seemed like they were trying to cater to a whole new audience here. What was up with every other scene having a kid in it or being about the tribe of children?While being nowhere near the Mad Max 2 Road Warrior, then Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is still watchable, but take into consideration that it deviates quite a lot from the previous movie.I will say that they went all out in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome with the sets, costumes and vehicles. They had managed to build up a more distinct atmosphere and environment here, and that was one of the best things about the entire movie.One thing I didn't get was why they recast Bruce Spence for this third movie. In part 2 he was known as the gyro captain, and in the third movie he is known as Jedediah the pilot. Was it supposed to be two entirely different characters? I assume as much, since there were no relationship or rekindled partnership between Max and this pilot character. If that was the case, it would have been more believable if they had opted for a different actor all together.It was nice that the underlying homo eroticism tones from the previous two movies were eliminated and replaced by a more harsh and unforgiving post apocalyptic atmosphere.Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is enjoyable enough for what it was, but kind of anti-climatic following after the second movie.

As to the first movie where you could spot farm houses in the backdrop and such.However, there is a heavy undertone of homo eroticism throughout the movie. Just take a look at Humungus and his gang. Their outfits and their behavior was screaming homo eroticism.Looking past that, then Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior is actually an enjoyable movie, and this is how I remembered Mad Max to be from my childhood. So I will just forget all about the abysmal first movie.The acting in the movie was quite good, especially Mel Gibson was doing a great job in developing Max in growing into a legendary action hero. As for the people in Humungus' gang, well... A bit of the acting was just forced and bordering on being comedy.Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior is fast paced, lots of action throughout the entire movie, and there is a great red line throughout the course of the movie. The action scenes are well choreographed. But especially hats off for the director and film crew for the driving sequences. They were just spectacular.All in all, then Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior is well worth watching. And for an action movie from 1981, then it still holds leverage as being watchable today.
