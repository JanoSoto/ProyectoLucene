However, despite its very definition, I was not prepared for the surprise I had while watching this film.  Perhaps it is because I went into it expecting to hate it, but because of my New Year's resolution to try to be more open-minded in my film viewing I decided to give it a shot.  (That doesn't mean that I am about to watch anything involving J. Lo or Sandra Bullock &#150; a woman has her limits) But I'll tell you why I expected to hate it  My grandmother and aunt loved it.  Absolutely nothing against their taste in films, but I've generally learned that I will never accept Meg Ryan as my personal savior, and they will never worship at the altar of Stanley Kubrick.  So I went into About a Boy with trepidation, but I went into it.What a wonderful choice, because it is an amazing film.  While under the guise of a comedy, it examines some very compelling issues, and treats them seriously.  Hugh Grant, who I feel has not done a decent film since Four Weddings and a Funeral, is brilliant in his portrayal of Will, a guy who has no idea what he wants in life and is one step worse than shallow  He readily acknowledges his shallowness.  Newcomer Nicholas Hoult is endearing as Marcus, the 12 year old boy Will begrudgingly takes under his wing.  (This kid also has the most interesting eyebrows in cinema right now)  Toni Collette rounds out the main cast as Marcus' depressed mother, a woman whose fragility is painful to experience through the eyes of her son. In terms of the story, the theme of `finding oneself' is certainly not new to cinema, but About a Boy addresses it in such a charming manner that even this extremely cynical viewer was drawn in immediately.  I watched this film (as I do most films) by myself, and was actually disappointed when I had to immediately interact with friends after seeing it because it's subtle profundity made me want to sit and reflect upon it.Although I generally don't like the actors involved, I don't normally `do' touching comedies, and About A Boy is the first Nick Hornby book I wasn't able to get through, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, so that makes this a great film in my eyes. And for once this is a movie that I can pretty much recommend to anyone.  So what do I think of praising a film my grandmother loved?

Lots and lots and lots of action sequences. You can feel the filmmakers just trying to top the last sequence instead of doing something like advancing the plot or developing the characters. Unless you think the action sequence is the be-all-and-end-all of movies, all that action just gets boring after a while. I have nothing against whiz-bang special effects as long as they do something worthwhile to move the film along (the Lord of the Rings films are good at this). But this is just not happening with the Matrix.The Matrix concept itself is thought-provoking. Why isn't it developed more? The fact that this monumental struggle for the soul of humanity ends up with a shoot-out, a helicopter-dangling rescue sequence and a martial arts fight is almost laughable. It's like saying the mysteries of the universe can be unraveled by watching beer commercials. If you want to see an ending that leaves you with something worth chewing on, you'll be sadly disappointed (as I was).As for other elements of the movie -- Keanu Reeves, as much as I usually enjoy watching him, was extremely wooden. Fishburne and Moss were good at what they did, but their parts were pretty two-dimensional. I couldn't get emotionally involved with any of the characters, which is ultimately the fault of the writers. The cinematography and style of the film and the sets is pretty cool to look at. However, the whole black clothes and sunglasses motif is just a little bit hokey after a while. And the agents -- I swear they look just like the bad aliens in Brother From Another Planet -- I kept expecting them to shriek at each other.I look at it this way - people who think that sitting in front of their tubes and playing video games is a worthwhile way to spend their lives will probably love this movie.

I think one of the problems I had with First Knight was that it left out the fantasy all together and was bogged down with a boring love story.  Here the love story is portrayed but so is Merlin and the mythical elements with Morgan and the sword, Excalibur itself.I really liked the visuals in the film.  The fights seem very real but the foggy atmosphere lets the audience know that the film is fantasy.  Mordrid is especially diabolical and the audience just has to hate him.

What I got was 'try hard' wit and ridiculous implausibility.Now this really p****s me off because I love Steve Martin, I love Laura Dern, I love Helena Bonham Carter and I love Kevin Bacon. I really expected more from a cast of very talented, very experienced actors. This basically means that the fault didn't lie with the cast. It lay with the severe implausibility of the story . SPOILERS IMMINENT!! REPEAT, SPOILERS IMMINENT!! At the film's beginning, Steve Martin's engaged to Laura Dern (what more could an average Joe want?), he's got a good job, he's got a very nice home, he's portrayed as a stable, even tempered middle aged dude. Suddenly Helena BC appears, asks for a script to be filled and Steve allows her to scam 10 times the amount of drugs from a local pharmacy! Two or so scenes later, when Helena BC steals the entire drug supply from Steve's dental surgery, Steve coyly makes up a paper thin story to the authorities that wouldn't stand up to detailed scrutiny by investigators!! This is when Novocaine jumped off the rails of plausibility and `Plot' gave way to `Series of Events'. To anyone out there who thought these scenes seem logical, do you realise how big a crime Steve's committing?? How much senseless risk?? How much all the drugs which Helena stole cost?? If Steve wanted to have some sex on the side, it would have been much, much cheaper and much less stress to go visit a high class lady of the night every night for several weeks.  And as for the climactic scene in the film from which the title is derived, I was physically disgusted and really couldn't believe that an tempered, stable middle aged dude would be capable of taking out all of their own teeth, as well as those of a corpse.

Steve, Laura, Hel and Kev all should have known better. 2\/10  ","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"14 July 2003","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  In my opinion, Novocaine had a brilliant trailer, but the film was a big disappointment. The first time I saw the trailer on a video rental, I knew I had to see Novocaine. I was expecting a Cohen Brothers style film of sharp wit and beautiful surreality. What I got was 'try hard' wit and ridiculous implausibility.Now this really p****s me off because I love Steve Martin, I love Laura Dern, I love Helena Bonham Carter and I love Kevin Bacon. I really expected more from a cast of very talented, very experienced actors. This basically means that the fault didn't lie with the cast. It lay with the severe implausibility of the story . SPOILERS IMMINENT!! REPEAT, SPOILERS IMMINENT!! At the film's beginning, Steve Martin's engaged to Laura Dern (what more could an average Joe want?), he's got a good job, he's got a very nice home, he's portrayed as a stable, even tempered middle aged dude. Suddenly Helena BC appears, asks for a script to be filled and Steve allows her to scam 10 times the amount of drugs from a local pharmacy! Two or so scenes later, when Helena BC steals the entire drug supply from Steve's dental surgery, Steve coyly makes up a paper thin story to the authorities that wouldn't stand up to detailed scrutiny by investigators!! This is when Novocaine jumped off the rails of plausibility and `Plot' gave way to `Series of Events'. To anyone out there who thought these scenes seem logical, do you realise how big a crime Steve's committing?? How much senseless risk?? How much all the drugs which Helena stole cost?? If Steve wanted to have some sex on the side, it would have been much, much cheaper and much less stress to go visit a high class lady of the night every night for several weeks.

You have got to be kidding!!! The use of brothers made the movie interesting, but the story line was boring, the soundtrack plain awful and the acting minimal at best.  One major drawback of movie was the lack of enough action sequences.  When there was a shootout it was bad even for 1980.  A much better movie was Frank and Jesse and Tombstone was the movie all others are measured by. All movies based on real characters or events add plenty of fiction to make the movie more entertaining to the viewer. While there were plenty of errors and omissions from Tombstone, Young Guns and Frank & Jesse, the plot plus characters and music made the movies memorable and an enjoyment to watch. This movie was missing all the necessary ingredients and like a bad soufflé fell flatter than pancake. I can't believe anyone could enjoy this movie.

The story is heartfelt and touching, and credible.  The humor is not dominant, but it is very funny where it is used. One of the most interesting aspects of this film is how its main characters fit some common stereotypes, yet don't feel at all like stereotypes. Martha is so much the uptight, regimented German but has so much submerged below the surface that you can still identify with her.  Just when you think she's loosening up, there's the hyperventilation scene.  Mario would not stand out in most movie scenes, but set in Germany, his quirky flirtatious charm is attention-getting.  Lina is portrayed brilliantly, and I look forward to seeing if this young actress will be in more films available in this country.  Martina Gedeck was so convincing as Martha, I have a hard time imagining her in any other role, but I have no doubt that she has other great performances in store.  A very rewarding, satisfying film.

This movie is not drugs. If anything, this movie is about obsession. Marlon Wayons needs to be important, Jared Leto wants everyone else to be happy, Jennifer Connelly craves sensation, and Ellen Burstyn yearns for attention. The drugs are merely a means to an end. The saddest aspect of this movie is the fact that you will try hard to deny the possibility of the events in it, but you can not. This could be reality for someone. Anyone who does not believe that only needs to watch the news. Woman hits man, drives home with him in the windshield, and leaves him in the garage to die. Every once in a while peeking in to say that she is sorry. Man molests eleven year old girl in department store. He dressed as a security guard and took her to a remote area, when too many people came to that area, he found another and molested her a second time. Grandmother poisons granddaughter, because she felt that she wasn't being paid enough attention by the child's parents. The woman put large amounts of sugar into the baby's formula and escaped before she could be captured. The child had a seizure and died. With these kinds of events happening daily, this movie's realism is in question. Why would Harry not go to the hospital if his arm was infected? Why would they get arrested for finally going to the hospital? Why didn't Sara just eat? Your answer is always the same, HOLLYWOOODIZATION! That would never happen in real life. I would never do that. One day in high school, a friend of mine got into a fight and shouted I don't want to deal with any more of this petty high school bulls**t! I remember thinking, welcome to the real world, where people do anything and everything to hurt themselves and each other. It is not possible that Harry hoped it would go away, or wanted to help everyone else before himself, or that he did not even think about it at all. The doctor in the hospital took the medicine out of the room that Harry was in. He probably called the police to tell them that junkies came to steal from the hospital. As for Sara I haven't a clue, but I still can not figure out what went through those people's heads from the headlines above. Does that make them any less real?I like this movie, because I can relate to it. Sara reminds me of my mother and I am almost dead on Harry. I knew some Marions and Tyrones in school. For me this movie is all too real.
