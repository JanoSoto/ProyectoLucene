The director is entirely unskilled at making movies, and furthermore seems to have an enormous amount of personal vanity, this based on the interview segments of the DVD. The main problem with the story, however, is the setting. It is set in the modern age, with guns, cars, and bombs, in the country of Rome. Apparently the screenwriter was too stupid to notice that Rome is no longer a nation. The film tries very hard to be entertaining, to tell a coherent story, and fails. If it failed in a spectacular way it would at least be funny, something to laugh at, but it does not do this. This is easily the worst adaptation of Shakespeare that i have ever seen, worse even than all of Branaugh's attempts to ruin the works. Not worth the almost three hours it takes to watch.

I'd seen it in Woolworths, looked at it and thought it might be interesting, but nothing special. I had not specially asked for it, and the original film was rated by one magazine as the 4th scariest film of all time. Therefore, I didn't really have any expectations of this film. I expected it to be average, nothing spectacular and probably not as good as the original. Indeed, I began watching it in a fairly neutral mind.And it has to be said, things were going promisingly, what with the weird caretaker and wife, and the 'beautiful' (although that's arguable) carvings of the children's heads. The story about the former owner, who couldn't have looked more evil in his portrait if he had tried. It was working well, leaving me intrigued as to what was going to happen and when.Then we move to the rather unfortunate second part of the story. I can't really describe this part in any detail simply because it was so rushed that I didn't really have any idea what was going on or why. The startling discovery (which wasn't all that startling anyway) simply lacked justification. Why did it happen? Why did the former owner do what he did? Hello????And of course, the totally rushed second part makes way for the utterly awful third part of the film. What took place, for lack of a better word, was inane, utter drivel. And because I didn't know what was going on in the second part, I honestly couldn't say I cared that much about the third part. But what I find all the more amazing is claims by people that they found it scary. Er, when exactly?

He didn't do a dreadful job, just never seemed to get to evoking the Potsylvaninian villain.The biggest problem with the film is with the writing. Adding the palling Karen Sympathy as the focal character was a big step right into the center of the cow pasture, from which this movie fails to escape. I understand that this was probably a ploy to bring in viewers who weren't fans of the original series. As a fan, I have no use for these people. What I want is something close to the original feel, almost anything that the non-fans want will most likely detract from that goal. However they might want to dress up the movie, the sympathetic FBI character who loves Rocky & Bullwinkle is a limp character and subtracts from the movie from the start.It is ironic that the writer chose a theme about keeping the kid inside alive in a film that is about a cartoon that was never intended for kids. Yes, adults might have needed to be somewhat childlike to enjoy the original series, but the series aimed its jokes at adults, and included a modicum of material for kids. The reason that I love Rocky and Bullwinkle is that I noticed that the cartoon grew with me. I heard Jay Ward explain it like this. When you are young, you have physical action and slapstick. For an older kid, there are puns and bizarre situations. For an adult, satire and subtler adult humor.The writing also had very few jokes or gags that made me feel like I was watching Rocky & Bullwinkle. There is a sequence where Boris steals the narrator's map and another where Natasha explains Boris's reference to Potsylvainian Hospitalability. That's it. For one thing, the script needed more inversions in order to invoke the proper spirit of the cartoon villains. Boris and Natasha are satirical takes on one-dimensional melodramatic villains. Everything that is good is bad (The cartoon refers to the Potsylvanian magazine Bad Housekeeping, for example). That is why it is so wrong for Natasha to tell Fearless Leader that he is so GOOD to them.It seems that the writer only had consultants who had actually seen the show. He was only told the type of gags that R&B had. Oh, they typically did fourth-wall jokes, so they need to talk to the camera and narrator. Throw in some word plays.

DOLITTLE 2 \/ (2001) *** (out of four)I am often cautious when I walk into a theater to screen a sequel, but even more so when it's the sequel to a family comedy. Family comedies are so lazy these days. Many filmmakers seem to think their target audience isn't analytical, therefore, they do not take the proper precautions. The 1998 hit Doctor Dolittle wasn't a great movie, but it was entertaining and amusing. Steve Carr's  Doctor Dolittle 2 is even better. The film works because it doesn't waste time explaining what we already know. It relies on the first film for the character development and circumstances, and also creates a story that stands on its own. The plot drifts a little here and there, but it's new material, not a duplication of Doctor Dolittle.  This is the kind of movie that revives this struggling genre.Eddie Murphy takes center stage again as Dr. John Dolittle, but he has a more important role in this film. In the original, he was upstaged by the talking animals; he simply reacted to their various crude and witty comments. Here, he's the main focus of the plot, thus, the film provides us with a stronger central character. I like the way the movie gives Dolittle dimension by incorporating his family into the story. We learn more about his wife (Kristen Wilson), and his lovely daughter Charisse (Raven-Symone), who learns of a new ability and forms a love interest with a young man. Some of these family aspects work well, and others fall flat. Charisse's relationship with her father is involving, but the subplot dealing with her boyfriend does not pay off.John Dolittle is a world-famous veterinarian who can talk with animals. The premise involves Dolittle's attempts to save a forest that is about to be leveled by a powerful forester (Jeffrey Jones). A slick attorney (Kevin Pollak) represents our enemy, while Dolittle recruits his lawyer wife to defend his case in court. Dolittle's only true argument depends on a protected species of bear. Unfortunately, there's only a single female bear who cannot reproduce by herself, so why save her habitat? But wait! There's a circus performer male bear of the same species. Dolittle rushes to persuade the animal to come to the wild and mate with the female bear, but will he want to leave his circus home?Doctor Dolittle 2 is not an extremely funny movie; its more amusing than hilarious. A lot of the film's humor comes off as surprisingly dual and annoying. Such humor evolves from a lizard's inability to blend with his environment, a canine's attempts to pick up a wolf, convincing the two bears to mate, and a monkey's drinking problems. These jokes lack the sharp impulse, the zest, the perfect timing, and the wit we encountered in the first film. Until the creative, prosperous final act, Doctor Dolittle 2 invokes very few laughs.Eddie Murphy supplies his character with the perfect amount of wit and energy. He is the funniest thing in the movie. The filmmakers decided to tone down some of the crude humor and sexual entendres to warrant the movie family-orientated PG rating. Murphy still takes advantage of the mildly risqué material present, however, as he makes the film more viewable and entertaining. The filmmakers learned from the first film, where Murphy was too passive and reactive. Here, they put him on screen whenever possible, and that's why Doctor Dolittle 2 is better than the original.

Well, the gags are a mixture of cartoon slapstick, film references and the fine interplay with Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers (and, later, Cameron Diaz).  Disney takes a (deserved) hammering throughout - but I wouldn't want to spoil any of the jokes by revealing them here.  John Lithgow is also great as the prince who wants to create the perfect kingdom.  The mixture of material means there is plenty to amuse everyone and, unlike the recent Disney output, the plot is very strong too - entertainment with a message, what more could anyone want?!The one minor blemish is Myers' Scottish accent as the eponymous ogre - offputting for a British audience perhaps, more than in America.  Overall though, a triumph.

It has so many good points and so many bad points that you can think it's either a good or a bad film.But, to avoid that complexity, I'll try to recall them and write them down here, and let you construct your own conclusion. Of course, you have to keep in mind at every moment that this is the most expensive film ever made so far. So these are the points.1) The music. I place it at the first place because it is in my opinion the worst thing in the movie. This film needed a soundtrack by John Williams, for example. He would never have used that minor seventh chord for almost all the scenes (including both love and war scenes), which makes the film so emotionally flat. In Gladiator we have a good example of what music can do to a film (not to mention Star Wars...).2) The script. Pearl Harbor has a really poor script, based on a simple and original idea but poorly developed. In Saving Private Ryan we have a simple and original idea brilliantly developed. The film is so predictable that 1 hour before its ending I already knew it (I think that even before that...). It's a paradox in a film which is based in a fact that's basically one of the biggest surprises in history. Well, you could say but history is already known, and you would be right, but the film isn't already known until you watch it. In Titanic I really was surprised when the ship collided...!3) The look. This film succeeds in creating another world for us. We feel transported to another time, with plenty of details, and that's something remarkable. The nurses look like fashion models, and Evelyn puts lipstick on her lips in every scene, but I'm not really sure if things were that way in 1941.4) The special effects. Pearl Harbor has one of the best special effects I have ever seen. The war scenes are so real that they can override all the bad points we could find. A lot of CGI has been used, but it's well done and looks real. As a result there is the best recreation ever made of what the Pearl Harbor attack could be. As in Saving Private Ryan, we find ourselves inside the battle and understand what those people should feel.5) The message. I know that films don't necessarily need a message, but this one needed one. And it really has one, but with a wrong envelope. In Saving Private Ryan, the old man at the cemetery asks his family if he is a good person. He has no physical injuries, but his soul is badly damaged, and desperately asks for a redemption to rip that black ghost away from him. We call this CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, and there's nothing of this in Pearl Harbor. Rafe and Danny kill a lot of people and pass through extreme situations, Evelyn lives the worst nightmare in her life, and after all of that we don't see any change in them. Most war films from the past (being most of them propaganda films) are the same way. That's NOT real, and doesn't help at all to send a message as we don't identify with the characters.You can make your own conclusions. This is mine Film industry has lost its aim, which used to be art. They live for the moment, and don't care for anything but money. Nowadays a lot of good special effects are the perfect passport to success. All the other elements are chosen by its impact on masses rather than by its artistic value. And the artistic value is what really makes great films adored by masses, but in a long term.If you are curious about my rating to this film, here it is 6-7\/10.

I guess that's an easy approach to take when summing this film up, since its two female leads featured in Party Of Five and episodes of Doogie Howser (man what an awful show that was), not to mention that one of the male leads would be doing well to act his way out of a wet paper bag. The problem with that is that it is just too easy, and easy answer is exactly the sort of thing that this film goes out of its way to avoid. It is not trying to be a modern Hitchcock, it is not trying to be another Basic Instinct, it is just trying to tell a story.The story, such as it is, seems to revolve around Blue Bay High School, the town it is located in, and its snobby, high-income elite, at least in the first reel. We are introduced to all four of the characters who will figure prominently in the story to come during a lecture to the students in their senior year. There's Sam the guidance counsellor, Ray the corrupt policeman, Kelly the daughter of the wealthiest real estate mogul in town, and Suzie the girl from the caravan park across town. All four of these characters have secrets they'd rather not share with any other inhabitant of the town, but that all comes apart when Kelly accuses Sam of raping her. Suzie corroborates her story at first, but then we get our first inkling that things are not all they seem, through the efforts of Bill Murray in one of his best cameos ever. The whole thing is seemingly a conspiracy between Sam, Suzie, and Kelly, but we are never shown whose idea it is until the very end.This next passage will ruin a key surprise the film has in store, so don't read it if you haven't seen it. Unless things have radically changed in this regard during the last ten years, psychologists and other such professionals do not tell test subjects exactly what their IQ is. Even if Suzie or her mother did know exactly, this whole point is delivered with such sledgehammer force that it almost utterly ruins the subtle, slow buildup that the rest of the film exhibited. Were they just running out of money when it came time to film this spot and just decided to go with the quickest, simplest thing they could do? It would have been much more effective and satisfying if the ugly cop (I forget the name) had just spent five or ten minutes going through whatever Suzie had left behind on her run to the Carribean. Summing up this plot point in fifteen seconds was an exceptionally bad move.Overall, however, you can't really go wrong with this film for an evening's entertainment. It doesn't feel the need to talk down at its audience, it doesn't resort to excess simplicity to make itself understood (except for the aforementioned ending), it just tells a story and tells it reasonably well.

","genre":null},{"date":"9 July 2001","score":"31 out of 47 people found the following review useful","review":"  During the very limited theatrical run that Wild Things recieved here (I think it was gone in about three weeks), a lot of the reviews and publicity created the impression that this was a soap opera sex thriller. I guess that's an easy approach to take when summing this film up, since its two female leads featured in Party Of Five and episodes of Doogie Howser (man what an awful show that was), not to mention that one of the male leads would be doing well to act his way out of a wet paper bag. The problem with that is that it is just too easy, and easy answer is exactly the sort of thing that this film goes out of its way to avoid. It is not trying to be a modern Hitchcock, it is not trying to be another Basic Instinct, it is just trying to tell a story.The story, such as it is, seems to revolve around Blue Bay High School, the town it is located in, and its snobby, high-income elite, at least in the first reel. We are introduced to all four of the characters who will figure prominently in the story to come during a lecture to the students in their senior year. There's Sam the guidance counsellor, Ray the corrupt policeman, Kelly the daughter of the wealthiest real estate mogul in town, and Suzie the girl from the caravan park across town. All four of these characters have secrets they'd rather not share with any other inhabitant of the town, but that all comes apart when Kelly accuses Sam of raping her. Suzie corroborates her story at first, but then we get our first inkling that things are not all they seem, through the efforts of Bill Murray in one of his best cameos ever. The whole thing is seemingly a conspiracy between Sam, Suzie, and Kelly, but we are never shown whose idea it is until the very end.This next passage will ruin a key surprise the film has in store, so don't read it if you haven't seen it. Unless things have radically changed in this regard during the last ten years, psychologists and other such professionals do not tell test subjects exactly what their IQ is. Even if Suzie or her mother did know exactly, this whole point is delivered with such sledgehammer force that it almost utterly ruins the subtle, slow buildup that the rest of the film exhibited. Were they just running out of money when it came time to film this spot and just decided to go with the quickest, simplest thing they could do? It would have been much more effective and satisfying if the ugly cop (I forget the name) had just spent five or ten minutes going through whatever Suzie had left behind on her run to the Carribean. Summing up this plot point in fifteen seconds was an exceptionally bad move.Overall, however, you can't really go wrong with this film for an evening's entertainment.

In fact, the only thing that makes this movie worth watching is Jet Li's presence.  Unfortunately, even his incredible screen presence was cut off at the knee by poor directing, a lack of character development and too-short fight scenes.  The movie skips any semblance of an opener and so fails to give us any insight or connection with Jet Li's character, let alone a taste of his abilities.  It also fails to explain why the bad guys imported a not so pretty single mother from North Dakota and kept her as an unsuccessful prostitute, while pouring valuable drugs into her and keeping her daughter in orphanage at their expense.  And Bridget Fonda is horrible as this prostitute.I must admit the action sequences were quite good, but the fight scenes were too short and plagued by that bane of good martial arts cutting the shot to another angle prematurely.  Jet Li's presence in a room filled with smoke was simply incredibly, even if what followed lacked his usual elegance.  He also got to utter don't do that again in that so matter-of-fact it's menacing tone (That was a mistake --Romeo Must Die).  Too bad you couldn't actually see most of the action that followed the line.Perhaps Jet Li is trying to get away from being a martial arts star and become simply an action star who also does wushu.  What a pity if he does.  Action stars are a dime a dozen; martial artists of Jet Li's calibre who can also act are quite rare.  Jet Li in motion is beautiful, but this movie doesn't portray much of it.  The few moments where he is allowed to shine are so short.  In almost every kung fu movie, you see this comment, Too much wirework.  Please, just let us see Jet Li do his stuff, unhampered by funky camera angles and switches.
