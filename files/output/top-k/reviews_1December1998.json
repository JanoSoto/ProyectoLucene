So I won't go into the details here;  suffice to say this was a well-made movie.And well-acted.  It's a big break for Cate Blanchett but my concern is that she may have done this role only too well; i.e., that she ends up remembered only for this role -- worse yet, that she ends up in Elizabeth-esque roles (tough, regal, remote, &c.) the rest of her career.  Just look at 95% of Al Pacino's roles since The Godfather.

The film effectively blames the people of NI as being the cause of their own troubles. It suggests that the 25 year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with Britain's partition of Ireland and domination of its history i.e. NI was created by Britain in 1921 irrespective of the wishes of the rest of Ireland.The characters are portrayed as hapless fools, even though I despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause - maintaining their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is a known fact that British Intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war, no doubt to keep the Catholics at bay and demoralise republicanism.Nineties' values about 'machismo', masculinity etc are transposed on to 1970s Belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique Irish 'psyche' which leads to violence. The stupid song from the woman in the club - old Ireland of green fields ..blah..blah.. - is given a symbolic stature, i.e. poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause. Tedious, ahistorical, cheap and nasty trash. O'Sullivan has made a personal statement on a conflict which requires serious political analysis.

I really liked this movie, and thought it was intense and powerful. Violent too, yes, but always in a realistic way. The cinematography is especially stunning. It was breath-taking, and I'm still thinking of it a week after. American History X is a movie that has an impact, that make us think about true problems.
