I find it odd that not a single review made such comparison.In The Grapes of Wrath, farmers had trouble make their living despite being very hard working. Some people woke up and realized the root of the problem while some others are on their path to find out why. The main character Tom had frequent talks with a friend who was on such journey to find out why until he was murdered.

Despite the initial claim in the movie that robots do not know love, the movie later on actually indicates they do. It is clearly shown in the scene where used robots get torn apart. Elder robots made attempts to protect others from watching the horrifying scene of robots getting blown apart. Such is in great contrast to David's obsession of being love by his human mother.Sure, the first part was quite short, but by itself is good.

The stylized presentation fits very well. The editing does nothing to hide that these stories come straight from comic books... in fact, it rather seems to dwell on it, indulge in it. This effect isn't overdone(as was the case in Hulk), but rather serves the film well. The plots are fairly well-written(though I felt the fourth tale to be overlong), if never really deep or insightful. The character writing is quite good, though; I didn't really find one single character to be anything less than credible(though there were times I couldn't figure out what they were trying to do, until it was shown or they said it out loud). The pacing is fairly good, most of the stories aren't too long(apart from aforementioned fourth one, The Crate, which takes about twice as long as the others, at around 40 minutes running time, whereas most of them are just about 20 minutes). The basic idea of each segment seems to be to set up some unappealing characters, have them do awful things to equally 'bad' people and then get what's coming to them. Secluded areas and a low count of characters seem to be common traits, as well. I guess the reason these work is that many people would like to see things like the stuff that takes place in the novellas to these people(and their kinds do exist, which is presumably why we so easily accept not only them but their fates in the stories) in real life, to the same types. The acting ranges, but most is pretty good. Whoever thought Leslie Nielsen could act? The special effects are fair, though more often than not, you see too little to make out what's going on. Mostly, they work well, though. The lighting is pretty good, if over-dramatic at times, and too limited at other times, again making it difficult to tell what happens on-screen. The cinematography varies, but most of it is on the good side. For some reason, much of the film felt low-budget to me... it were as if the budget was enough for one full story, maybe a few of them, but not all five, and instead of scrapping the ones they couldn't afford, they made all of them and just took the money they needed from the rest, at the expense of the overall quality of, well, all of them. The production values and shooting style seem to reflect this... surely Romero, of Trilogy of the Dead(or The Dead series) fame knows how to make the most of a small budget? This looks so much cheaper than anything I've seen him do. Maybe he took on too much work by directing all five segments? In any case, the result is still worth watching. Apart from possibly The Crate, I enjoyed all the stories to some extent. I recommend this to all fans of horror, George A.

China, still a land of lack of freedom of speech, albeit much better than Mao's time, Zhang was able to make such a movie rife with hidden and conspicuous messages projecting the ultimate human tragedy at such a scale that no other human histories can match or parallel it, not even the Holocaust or the massacre of Armenians by the Turks, or the Nanking massacre of Chinese by the Japanese troops.This suffering lasted 30 years and beyond. Find out how many people were killed during that era and how that affected the progression of Chinese modernization. The movie portrays in great accuracy the turmoil in China before (don't forget the WWII that Chinese just suffered from the brutal invasion from Japan, then the civil war between Mao and Chiang) and after Mao's victory over Chiang in securing the Thorn as The New Emperor of China in the 20th Century with the aid of modern technology and political ideology which enabled Mao to surpass the sum of all other evil doers such as Hitler, Lenin and Stalin.An image is worth of a thousand words. To be brief, one scene that Zhang crafted to represent the reality of China in the 60's is the limping Red Guard's wedding day. He is all dressed up (not really a true 'dressed-up' in our terms, but just put a red flower on his chest and some minor decorations) and happily walking with a crowd toward the bride's home for the wedding. The moment of seemingly a greatest joy, yet is in fact the moment of the greatest sadness. What we are really seeing is a limping person (representing communism, or the status of China back then) walking joyously with a crowd who have no idea what the outside world is about. They are all very poor, live in shambled homes and dress in old and severely worn clothes and shoes, whereas in Taiwan, Chiang is pushing up the economy with the aid of the US and so are many other countries that are quickly recovering from WWII including Japan and the European countries. People in the US are rapidly back to their normal lives, besides the Vietnam war.But behold, don't think that it is a fairy-tale or distant lives of others. Don't think that Chinese or other ancient cultures are destined for the endless turmoil and sadness. Here in the US is not exempt, that people are all the same, perhaps at a different scale. If Chinese can do so, we can do worse. While every one can become a leader of a nation, once they become a leader, they are no longer one of us, like a transmutation. If you don't trust Chinese government, you shouldn't trust our (US) government either. Don't expect that if the government would really accept mistakes that they made.One thing is for sure, as long as we are genetically built as what we are now, there will be no ideal government. This is as good as you can get. So either we stay out of politics and live our peaceful little lives, or be part of the dirty pot of corruption or delusion, and run for the president. And if you think you are truly a person of great conscience, you will never be a president of any kind. You'd be elbowed out of the game before you even know it.

I was in the mood for some action.John Travolta stars as a USAF Major who is planning drop of the nuclear bomb he's carrying for a test run and steal them. Unfortunately, his co-pilot and a park ranger was not part of his plans.Let's start by saying this is a 100% pure action movie. Cheesy dialog, big explosions, a chick and impending doom. Who can possibly ask for more? The writing is OK. The plot is OK, but there are holes and less logical things. The dialog is fake and cheesy at times. The characters is nice enough developed, but there could be done more work here. There are some nice touches done in the writing too, I'll give it that. All together the writing is OK. Not the best, but in no way the worst either. The story was probably just an excuse to fly helicopters and blow stuff up.The cast is very varying in their performance. John Travolta does a great job, in portraying his villain. He portray his character in an incredible way, and is such a bad ass. Christian Slater is not bad either, but not quite there. As for Samantha Mathis, we've seen better. Not all bad, but far from good. The rest of the cast is average. No one worth mentioning in particular.The film is technically good. The cinematography is good. Some cool angles and stuff and all over good. The sound editing is nice and the special effects, well being an action movie you gotta expect good special effects and you get it. Big explosions, bodies thrown through the air, crashing aircrafts, bullet hits everything is there and most of it is well done.One thing to notice is the music. Zimmer made a nice theme that follows the score through the movie. Very effective and combined with the visual, very cool.What makes this movie get a five out of ten is all the minor flaws and rather bad story it has. It's far from a good movie. The good thing is, this movie does not try to be anything it's not. It's just a simple entertaining mindless shoot 'em up action flick and not trying to be anything else it's a good one at that.

You get to indulge yourself in every possible way.. but there's a catch. When your Lifeclock starts blinking, you are 30 years old, and must take your chances on the carousel to be 'renewed'. Those that want to live get hunted down, toyed with, and then killed by Sandmen, judge jury executioners.Utopia with a frightening population control method. And even in a Utopian society, there were the juvenile delinquents, housed in Cathedral. As much as it is enjoyable, I can fully understand why William Nolan was irked at the changes that veered away from his book. I had read the book several years before seeing the movie.

Thanks to a trusty revolver and his idiot savant sidekick Gnaghi, this is no problem. At least until the beautiful widow (Anna Falchi) of one of the corpses starts haunting his fantasies.So, you have seen Rupert Everett as Prince Charming in the Shrek films and as Christopher Marlowe in Shakespeare in Love and in other romantic roles. But you have never seen him in a romantic role like this. And unlike in real life... he is in love with a woman!I cannot stress how much better this film is than most of the other rehashed zombie films out there. The movie is unique in at least two ways first, it focuses primarily on a man living in zombie territory without the zombies themselves or his conflict with them being the actual focus (and later in the film they become only an afterthought). Second, the film relies heavily on humor without becoming a comedy like Shaun of the Dead or even like the more subtle Return of the Living Dead, keeping us amused even as we are supposed to be chilled. I suppose the humor level could be compared to Peter Jackson's Bad Taste or Dead Alive, only much darker.The supporting cast is incredible. A mayor so obsessed with re-election he wants photos taken of him grieving over his daughter's dead body, a bodiless head who falls in love with a puking half-wit, the widow who keeps reappearing as other incarnations (Anna Falchi, who gives each identical character their own personality) and Franco the city clerk... whose role in all this is very strange and possibly impossible to determine.The cultural references are subtle, but show that the director is truly a master of the macabre. The primary example, of course, is when the two lovers kiss underneath the sheet, in a very Magritte-esquire camera shot. This is very much like the painting Lovers II, which evokes all sorts of questions about love and modesty. The film as a whole is much like a moving painting, with each shot beautifully framed and angled.There are also homages to A Clockwork Orange and a subplot involving the engineer's rumored impotency -- and the extreme measures he is willing to go in handling that situation. Each little deviation, while not crucial to the central plot, further illuminates how absurd and existentialist life can be. If these detours do not convince you -- wait for the shocking conclusion! Questions will be raised about what is real and what is not -- does each reincarnation of She really look the same, or is this all in Francesco's mind? Is Francesco himself real, or only the creation of an incapacitated Franco? What do we make of the end when Gnaghi and Francesco switch places and we see a physical solipsism before us? Based on things director Michele Soavi has said, I believe he intended the film to be real life -- not a dream or delusion. But what can we then make of the mind-bending moments?If you are looking for a horror film with a sense of humor or a great zombie film, this should be your first choice. Or if you are unsure about a horror film, but you have a love for films such as Dark City, this might be something that will keep you second-guessing your reality.

Lines and image composition recur in Kay's film from Michael Hodges' original script. Especially check out the sequence in each film where Carterforces one of the guilty parties to drive into the dark woods where he has to decide how to mete out justice.... Well, let's discuss that scene, because it is crucial to both films, and the differing decisions the two Carters make tells us the difference between the two films. In Hodges' film, Carter kills the person with an overdose of heroin. In Kay's Carter scares the pee out of the person, then leaves off with a warning. The ethic of the first film is such that this becomes an act for which we cannot forgive Carter, because the person he happens to be killing is actually as much a victim of the criminal enterprise Carter bucks as are the people he's supposedly avenging. In other words, he's committing the same crime he's accusing his victim of. In the commentary on the DVD, Kay is very clear about the ethic of his own version - revenge isn't justice. So of course, the person Carter almost kills has to be represented as into something way over his head; the warning thus may work as well as any punishment to change this behavior. Does this make Kay's film lesser than the original? Not by itself. But it does highlight the real weakness of the Kay version - He has a firm grasp on how these people relate to each other as people, but he doesn't really understand how criminals relate to other criminals - which of course is precisely what gave the original its vicious edge. Stallone's Carter needs to be way more ruthless and scary than he is now. This is a guy who beats up people for money - are we to presume that he never accidently beat some innocent schmo with a bad debt to death? And had this been emphasized, his response to his niece would actually have been perceived as all the stronger, since this man is really unredeemable, even by his own standards. The way this misstep effects Kay's film is that he frequently moves the camera around the story, rather than positioning it in the middle of the action (this is really done on the editing board, using the now-stale MTV choppy style that real cineastes have grown to loathe). Whereas the continuity of the original film was fiercesomely linear and direct to the point, the continuity of Kay's film leaves threads dangling that we really need tied up.Having said all this, I must also commend a film that, to be honest, I have really grown to love. It's a personal affection, but it does say something about Kay and his actors. I happen to know all these people, or I have met them along the way. I know exactly what Stallone's Carter is feeling for his niece and why, and how he will respond - how he must respond - to her victimization. Kay is quite right when he claims that this is the heart of his movie. Like most other viewers, I only wish he had taken it to the same limits as the Hodges' film, which he so clearly admires.

I like this movie because of the story. Its amazing how Mr. Spielberg got some big actors to play to the characters he made.The battle in the beach is one of my favorite part in the movie, you can see the reality and truth about the war.The other one is the part of questioning their leader why 8 men risking their lives to save just one.

This movie is one of my all time favorite.
