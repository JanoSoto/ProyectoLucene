Any classic Scooby fan will like this film for its entertainment, but not for anything to do with Scooby Doo, and here is why I feel that way.After watching about 30 episodes in one week, I performed a small role analysis on Scooby Doo once for a psych course, and things don't pan out well with the movie.  Most of the time in the series, Fred was the one who kept the group together and was a natural leader.  What some won't recognize is that when it came to getting his hands dirty though, it was a sign of fear on his part that the group was always using Shag and Scoob for the dangerous parts and maybe a little machismo in that he always went with Daphne.  But Fred as a vain, self-centered, retard as in the movie? Hello, Fred solved half of the mysteries.  It wasn't all Velma.  Fred was the leader because of his likability.  Here, Fred is not likeable at all and Freddie Prince was a horrible choice for the part.  I like Prince as an actor, he simply didn't have the physique to play the part and his emotional spread wasn't there.  I don't know who to blame, but I'm going with the writers since I think he's done better.  Furthermore, I did NOT want him and Daphne to get together, as I always hoped in the cartoons.Then there is Daphne.  For goodness sakes.  Buffy is hot and a good actress, but Daphne was in no way a woman of the 90's.  In the newer Scooby Doo movies, they did a really good job of modernizing her, especially in Zombie Island (where the monsters were also real).  She was an individual career woman and her wealth was underplayed.  She was still able to be attractive without being a ditz.  She had just enough vulnerability to make her endearing to Fred.  But here she comes off much more self-centered (although not so much as Fred by a long shot in the movie) and a martial arts expert. Why would she even hang out with the rest of these misfits?  The whole universe is thrown out of whack.  To put it in the words of another favorite modern kids cartoon, it really WOMPED.Next, there's Velma.  Her vulnerability is shown through her glasses dependence, along with a little comic relief.  She is the intelligent one. Here is another place where this film upset me.  They go to all the trouble of modernizing Daphne, and then they go and throw back Velma.  Here was the woman of the 90's invented in the 60's, but in this film, she is prone to peer pressure and just wants to be cool.  Well, Velma always was cool and sure of herself.  She didn't need the accolade of others, she had her own intrinsic motivations.  With the exception that Velma is totally hot in this film, they screwed her.  The actress did an excellent job playing the part that was directed and we will definitely being seeing more of her, but the part itself stunk.  I in no way pitied the character and wanted her to be liked, instead, I wanted her to just get the you know what slapped out of her until she came to her senses.Finally, there is Shaggy and Scooby.  Yes, I saved the best for last. Lillard and Scooby were excellent.  Lillard, although somewhat type cast when you look at his parts (and he needs to do more without Prince) is the key to this film.  His interplay with Scooby is believable.  The computer graphics are believable.  But even here the writers and directors messed up a good thing.  The drug scene was always an implication in the toons.  It in no way needed to be anything more than that.  Most children under 12 do not pick up on the drug hints in the cartoons.  Well, there is no way to miss it her.  Boo on hollywood for this one.  Should have been PG-13, and then maybe they would have rewritten it a little to get back a PG rating, like getting rid of the drug parts.  I don't remember weed smoke coming out of the Mystery Machine, do you?  For that matter, they're sort of saying then that all of the kids did drugs if only second hand, which is sort of implied in the series as well, but it doesn't need to be in the movie this way.Lastly, we all hate Scrappy.  Can we agree on that one.  I especially liked the handling of him on the Cartoon Network when they did the Scooby Doo Project.  Velma and Daphne go running when they hear da-da-da-da---da-da. Velma tells Daphne, It's only Scrappy, and then Daphne replies as she is running, I know.  Made me laugh and laugh.I know some other commenters didn't like real monsters.  Well, that didn't kill this film.  Zombie Island had real monsters and it was good.  Witch's Ghost had a real witch and it was good.  This had real monsters and it stunk, flat out.  If I didn't have free tickets, I wouldn't see it.  I have every Scooby available on DVD, but I will NOT be buying this on DVD unless it is under $12, and even then, I will only get it for Lillard\/Shaggy and Scooby.  Lillard's Scooby was even better and made me laugh more than SNL's parody.

The French film was hilarious and (in its time) daring.  Some of it's views are dated, but not offensive.  The Birdcage follows the original script VERY closely and adds a few (unfunny) lines of it's own.  Incredibly, though, it throws in every offensive gay stereotype known.  There's the lisping, queeny maid (Hank Azaria), the EXTREMELY effeminate man (Nathan Lane) and his mincing, swishy partner (Robin Williams).  The film encourages you to laugh at their mannerisms again and again.  As a gay man I was very offended (especially by Azaria).  But I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh.Williams is a bit too swishy but, basically, underplays nicely.  Lane is way way WAY over the top and very loud and offensive--I really hated him.  Futterman is the most obnoxious character in the film--badly acted, smarmy and a real jerk.  Flockheart (pre-Ally McBeal) is very good but is given nothing to work with.  Azaria was so horribly stereotyped I wanted to scream.  However, Hackman and Wiest were a scream as the couple.  And Christine Baranski shows up and brightens up the movie.  Also the film is very colorful and there's plenty of buff guys and gals wearing next to nothing to get your attention.  All in all though, it's not as good as the original.

But if he was, he definitely deserved it over Denzel.  Carrey is nothing short of spectacular, giving one of the best screen performances I've seen in a while.  Now, I liked him in The Truman Show.  He definitely proved that he had great potential as a dramatic actor and gave a fine dramatic performance, but not Oscar-worthy.  And the film wasn't Oscar-worthy either, though it was good.  Well, I wouldn't regard The Majestic as Oscar-worthy, but I guess Carrey has a lot more to work with in the rich, multi-layered character of Peter Appleton.  Before I go on with the aesthetics of this film, I will let out what I really think of Jim Carrey.  He is a talented man, he has lots of it.  But his relentless jarring, in comic roles, does get quite tiring at times.  When I was in grade school, I thought the Ace Ventura movies were hilarious.  Now I can't stand a minute of either one of those flicks because of Carrey's annoying schtick.  So I was initially glad, while watching The Majestic, that Carrey was able to discipline himself and provoke himself from breaking into one of his manic episodes.  Now Robin Williams is known as a comic actor, but he is so great in his dramatic roles that I can honestly say he's just as talented at drama as he is at comedy.  And before watching Carrey's performance in this movie, Williams was the only comic actor who I felt had that kind of talent.  Just by this one performance, I can regard Carrey as a spectacular dramatic actor and I anxiously hope to see him in many more serious roles, despite how poor this one fared at the box office.  Screw what the general public says--put Jim Carrey in more serious roles!  We've seen enough of his a*s-talking. The most powerful scenes in this movie actually contain no dialogue.  Carrey's expressions alone communicate such deep emotional pain and sorrow.  He brought tears to my eyes in a great many scenes with his quietly powerful performance.  Frank Darabont must've had a hell of a hunch when he decided to cast Carrey in the lead role.  Needless to say, Carrey wouldn't be the conventional choice.  This looks like a role that would require a Tom Hanks.  Who would guess Jim Carrey?  As I said, why didn't he receive an Oscar nomination?  The story has its flaws, but overall it's quite interesting.  It has many dimensions.  Darabont and the writers blended the magic of early cinema, the Communist scare in the 50's, wartime heroism, a case of mistaken idenitity, romance and the triumph of the human spirit all into one film.  This is no fluff flick.  But it does have its dramatic conventions.  For example, the death of Luke's father, played wonderfully by Martin Landau.  Usually when you see a frail, elderly old man in a film like this, he's bound to die and die in a opera-like fashion with him muterring his last words to the one he loves.  It was sad to see his character die, but that was one moment that didn't choke me up because I expected it to happen.  Now I loved Carrey's speech at the end, pertaining to America's increased paranoia about Communism, and that was another moment that brought a tear to my eye, but let's face it--at a time like that, would they really allow him to return to Hollywood and write films, despite how powerful his words were?  Of course not.  But we wouldn't end such an uplifting drama with our beloved protagonist in prison.  And after Appleton revealed to the town that he was a fraud, would they really forgive him afterwards and hold another Welcome Back party for him?  And finally, there's the romance.  BTW, Laurie Holden--who I don't recall seeing before--also gives a superb performance.  Well, she naturally despises him after finding out that he's not really Luke.  Then he meets her in the semetary and she immediately forgives him and even offers him inspiration in the court case.  OK, it's established.  The Majestic is not a perfect motion picture.  Towards the end, it does falter into melodrama.  And it's never truly established why the townspeople mistook Peter Appleton for Luke.  Did the two of them just happen to look exactly alike?  I know they weren't long lost identical twins. Nevertheless, The Majestic is a powerful film with a powerful performance by Carrey, and I do suggest you have a box of tissues handy.  Darabont directed The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, so he knows how to tug at the audience's heartstrings and generate layers of emotional tension.  Why did this movie bomb at the box office?  Simple  The general public would rather watch Jim Carrey talk with his rear end.  Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but there's none of his trademark butt-talking this time around.  Instead, Carrey chooses to let down his audience's expectations by delivering a great performance that will send you on an emotional journey.  Oh, boo-hoo.  We don't wanna see that, do we?

After seeing what Raimi did with Marvel Comics wall-crawling superhero, I doubt that even James Cameron himself could have done better.Benefiting from four decades worth of comic book stories that have been told, Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp know what works and what doesn't when crafting the cinematic version of Spider-Man's origin. Indeed, it's a testament to the filmmakers' faith and love for the source material that so much of the movie's character arcs and plot points are borrowed directly from the comic books. If you're a fan of Spidey you'll be able to pick up on the many recognizable situations sprinkled throughout the movie. If not, don't worry.

Instead, Dafoe gives a crackling vibrant energy in his scenes as Spidey's nemesis, and any reservations I had about the Guyver-like Goblin costume were dispelled once Dafoe's Goblin hit his stride and started cackling his torments to his victims.While no one will ever argue that Kristen Dunst isn't lovely to look at as Mary Jane, Peter\/Spider-Man's love interest, really there's not much to her part.

Maybe a little romantic tension from a secondary love interest for Peter, like comic book hotties Gwen Stacy or Betty Brant, or maybe even someone pining for Spidey, such as Felicia Hardy\/Black Cat, would definitely stir the pot. Incidentally, I read somewhere that the decision to shorten Mary Jane's name to MJ for this movie was based on the fact that Mary Jane is universally recognized as another name for marijuana, and we can't be having that in a kids movie now can we.The remainder of the cast shines in their supporting roles. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson play a perfect Aunt May and Uncle Ben while J.K. Simmons manages to steal every scene he's in as Peter's Daily Bugle boss J. Jonah Jameson. As Harry Osborne, James Franco does a great job, an awesome job, of playing a best friend and a tormented son. After watching his final scene in this film, I'd like to change my vote from seeing villains like The Lizard or Doctor Octopus in the sequel to instead bringing Franco back and give him the spotlight as the next big bad guy Spider-Man faces.  He does, after all, turn into the Hob Goblin.The special effects do an outstanding job of showing us the concrete canyons Spider-Man swings through. Moments such as the first time Peter experiments with swinging left to right down a city street, or when he crawls up a wall for the first time, or the webbing he leaves behind are all executed brilliantly. This is the stuff all the fans have been dreaming about seeing. If you were worried the CGI would look CGI-ish, it does.

While I enjoyed The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, the idea of a completely made-up story starring a hit-or-miss David Spade didn't appeal too much to me. But as it turns out -- and MUCH to my delight -- I think I may have found, if nothing else, one of the single funniest movies out there -- no joke! Read ahead, and I'll explain the method to my madness. Emperor Kuzco (Spade) is a spoiled-rotten, overgrown brat of a dictator who has everything he could ever want and everyone at his beck and call. But there are those bent on thwarting his lap-o'-luxury lifestyle -- in particular, Yzma and her no-brain-all-brawn servant, Kronk. Yzma and Kronk conspire to poison Kuzco and take over the empire, but their plan slightly backfires when the diluted poison merely changes Kuzco into a llama (not exactly dead, but then I don't know how being a llama feels). Kuzco is thrown out of the city, befriends a not-too-trusting peasant named Pacha (John Goodman) -- himself a victim of the former Emperor Kuzco's plans for a summer house (complete with waterslide) where Pacha's home stands -- and with a little help, attempts to change himself back into human form and regain his throne. New Groove, I'm convinced, is only a Disney movie in name. It comes off, more times than not, like an extended episode of the WB's Animaniacs -- but this is a good thing. Spade, drenched with sarcasm, delivers an oft-times hysterical performance; Kitt should have done this voice-over gig a long, long time ago in a role that I doubt few could have fulfilled as perfectly as she did; Goodman is much more subdued as Pacha, but it makes for a nice balance with Spade; even Wendie Malick as Pacha's wife, Chicha, gets into the fun with a few zingers herself. But... the real star here, in a part absolutely tailor-made for him, is Warburton. In a role that could have been just another henchman, Warburton transforms Kronk into the ultimate object of clueless likeability (a la David Puddy -- Elaine's on-again-off-again boyfriend on Seinfeld). Some of the funniest scenes -- and I was practically doubled-over at times -- are Kronk's arguments with his alter egos, the classic angel\/devil shoulder buddies. Warburton puts a whole new spin on the act. And this is not a plug for Disney, but please do make the effort to see this movie.

Spielberg's triumph with Schindler's List was followed by the longest hiatus of his career, which was broken with ... Jurassic Park II, a lifeless sequel of the kind you'd once have sworn he'd never make - the single worst and most anonymous movie he's ever directed (Hook had its moments).  His next two films were improvements (there was nowhere to go but up) the first anonymous but not bad (Amistad), the second bad but not anonymous (Saving Private Ryan), but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after Schindler's List that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with A.I. in 2001).But he's well and truly back now, and I'm happy.  I've even learned to welcome it when he makes decisions which infuriate me, so long as he makes them with the right kind of self-assured arrogance.  I didn't like the voice-over at the end (we didn't need to be told that stuff; we could have worked it out), or the way he caved in to the modern tendency to be needlessly revolting (at least he don't play his gross-out moments for cheap laughs), or even the style of photography (it's easy to manipulate us into thinking the future is a grim place, if you push-process the film until even the images which in the normal course of events would be luscious and rich, are grimy and desaturated - there are other ways of getting colourless images, as Spielberg well knows, and many of them are better).  Yet, in the end, big deal.  The story is a knockout, the action is taut, the future rich, dazzling and believable.  Spielberg is to be particularly congratulated on how completely he has avoided the unimaginative dystopia of Blade Runner.  The future we see here is a MIX of dream and nightmare, so convincing a mix that we can't always tell them apart.Here's a measure of how good the movie is in an interview, Spielberg revealed that he completely misunderstood the issues which drive the stories - and there's simply no way of telling this from the finished product.  Unless Spielberg was just opportunistically latching on to the hook forced on him by a dim-witted journalist, he THOUGHT the movie was about how much freedom we are willing to give up in exchange for safety (in order to prevent terrorist attacks, for instance).  This is interpretation is strained.  Three people (the precogs) do indeed give up their freedom in order that millions of other people may be safer, and yes, there is an issue here.  When one of the Crime Prevention officer says, It's best not to think of them as human, I was surprised to find myself nodding in agreement.  The benefits of the system are so great that OF COURSE I'd rather not look too closely into the burden that must be borne by three - just three - individuals.  Aside from the three unfortunate precogs, nobody is asked to give up any freedom at all.  (Except, of course, the freedom to commit murder.  But under the law we are already unfree to commit murder, and a good thing too.)The interesting issues that DO fall naturally out of the story concern the futility of revenge.  After people who would otherwise have committed murder are prevented from doing so, they're sent to prison anyway, presumably on the grounds that that's what they deserve - and no doubt it IS what they deserve.  But it's clear enough that locking these people up, however much it may be in the interests of justice, serves no purpose.  It's exacting revenge on criminals for the sake of exacting revenge - which is exactly what the U.S. justice system is committed to doing at the moment, which is why the future is a realistic one.  (Apart from the precognition, that is.)  Anderton's mistake is to believe in the value of revenge, and he's never more admirable than when he realises his mistake.  (THAT was a great scene; it's a pity I can't tell you exactly why.  Suffice it to say that when we think we know where the story's going, we may indeed know where the story's going - but Spielberg is only allowing us to see so much of what's coming up in order to obscure the rest of it.)The final sign that Spielberg is again at his peak lies in the performances.  They're all good.  Tom Cruise's weakness as an actor is that he is only ever as good as his director, and the fact that he's so good here means that Minority Report was directed by the real Spielberg, the old Spielberg, the Spielberg with the same ability Charles Dickens had to make even his most grotesque creations, and even his LEAST grotesque, come to life.

That was mostly because I was tired.  I made a small attempt to catch up on what I missed while I napped, and when the film ended I was not too impressed.  Because of that, it has taken me some time before I decided to give this film another chance.  Thank god I did.  The first thing I realized is that you have to pay attention when you watch this film because it isn't lite viewing.  The characters have a lot of depth and if you don't pay attention you might miss it.  That would be a tragedy because then you wouldn't get to fully experience the absolutely stellar performance by Novak, and the even more stellar (and extremely intense)performance of Stewart.  Their chemistry is great, and it made for a very rewarding viewing experience.The film is also quite lovely to look at.  Much like 'To Catch a Thief', the cinematography is excellent.  The sights are as much of the film as the performances.  There is also a great dream sequence, kind of like the one you would see in 'Spellbound', in comparison.  The color scheme is well defined, in the movie as well as the dream sequence, and that is a large amount of reds and greens.  Of course the direction is excellent, and that is no surprise.  The first time I saw this film I hated it, the second time I loved it.  The story is simple enough, but the characters have a depth that isn't all that common in Hitchcock movies.  Usually there is mystery, but the humanity isn't always there like it is in this movie.  A visually and psychologically compelling movie that is among the best Hitchcock ever did.
