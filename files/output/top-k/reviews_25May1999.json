Well i never hate Star Wars but more the hardcore fans of SW who often attack Star Trek without great arguments like the Star Destroyer is bigger than the Entreprise so Star Wars is better than Star Trek you see what i'm talking about..., this debate is another story so it would be all for this...  So i go see this movie with the betters intentions in the world i also try to be objective and i put my Vulcan logic aside to replace it by the mythological and the fairy tales stuff of Lucas... Well its a good movie with beautiful eyes candies the space ships are beautiful and all this stuff ... But what about the characters. i left with the impression they have nothing interesting to say some will argue that SW isn't about character development well i don't think so the 3 others movies were somewhat interesting on this subject but the Phantom Menace just don't get it ! One other thing is Anakin at the end of the movie blowing out everything so easily !  Again some will say don't took it too seriously its Star Wars well i think Episode IV V VI were more serious but at same time were appealing to the children but Episode 1 fail on this its too child orienting !  Another things i didn't like is the race, it was cool but i think it was too long... it was also a way for Lucas to sell more video games ...  The first hour of this movie is simply boring and the other hour kick a$$ !  Now i will pass to the more positive aspect of the movie, the final lightsaber combat between Darth Maul and the 2 jedi are simply great and exciting !

I thought it was very enjoyable, it was action packed, and was a dazzling visual achievement! It's really a lot of fun as a movie alone.  This is actually a really good movie!  However, there is one thing wrong with it.  They are calling this part of the Star Wars saga!  Once you've seen the film, and you think about it, it's just not possible to compare this to any of the previous films.  Not because the characters were different, because whoever said that we knew who Han Solo and Luke Skywalker were when the first Star Wars film first came out?   But, for a lot of other reasons, and the characters can also be attributed to the many flaws in this prequel.First of all, I got the impression that the characters were undeveloped, overhyped, and written entirely for the sole purpose of marketing and selling action figures and toys.  For example, they hyped up the satanic looking Darth Maul for quite some time now, as this incredible and despicable villain.  He was only in the film for about 5 minutes!  I don't think Darth Maul was so bad, because I hardly got to know him.  He just sort of came and went.  I honestly thought that they could have done so much more with him, as they could have done with the overall film itself.  Although I like Liam Neeson very much in this film, because he is so commanding, serious, reverent, and never afraid.  They need more characters like him in this movie.  There were millions of opportunities open for character development and storyline fulfillment, yet nearly all of them were bypassed for time, or as my brother and I saw it, to market all of the ships and creatures that took up(or plagued) the 2 hour episode.And speaking of creatures, that is my real vendetta and overall upset with the film.  The creatures are childish and ugly, or as my sister saw it, racist and stereotypical.  One can only stand the astonishingly annoying Jar Jar Binks for a while, before contemplating his horrible murder!  And the race, which is a sci-fi chariot race, has a two-headed ESPN announcer! What the hell?  It's almost as if they were trying to spoof the Star Wars saga! C-3PO's presence in this film is implausible too, because it just seems so unlikely that C-3PO was the droid of Darth Vader as a boy, and that he bounced around the galaxy in the wars long enough to eventually land back on Tattoine and become Luke Skywalker's droid.  R2-D2 and the lightsabers are the only semblance to the original films.As far as mythology goes, it's gone!  The force has been clarified as some sort of bacteria certain people contain in their cells, and Anakin Skywalker is some kind of Immaculate Conception.  It's no longer Star Wars. It's an overly eager to please film that tries to satisfy the audience by trying to do and give everything away at once, instead of letting the saga conduct itself into the further films as it did with the original trilogy.And originality is an issue here too, because after the release of the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition, which I thought ruined many of the already powerful scenes of the original films, it seemed like the Special Edition was a bad omen for the upcoming prequel.  The prequel was going to be unsatisfying, overly childish, and swamped with gloppy creatures that get intolerably annoying after a while.  Indeed, my predictions were correct. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, far from it!  And it's certainly something not to be missed.  However, when you try comparing this to the original trilogy, you will realize that this simply doesn't measure up to what is expected of a Star Wars film.

I expected Star Wars to be different.  I was mistaken.Star Wars is a special case, of course, because we know how the entire thing will eventually end.  This kind of viewer foreknowledge poses a special challenge for the writers because for the most part the plot is already established.  The writer has less room to work.

It also has scenes that were really a Star Wars cartoon. And finally there is a long serious stretch that was more like Star Trek than Star Wars. And you know what? All of these different parts came together for me. Phantom is not great but good enough.I hear the howling out there that Phantom is not for adults!

The first Star Wars with its video game battles every 15 minutes, the constant arguing between its main characters and the frat party enthusiasm when things went right, it's not in Phantom. Lucas has grown up.Another thing about Lucas. He is a genius at making popular entertainment. My son's friends, 1st through 3rd graders love this picture. And why not. The computer animation is terrific and they get the humor. As I said people who do not usually like  science fiction have told me they enjoyed the seriousness of the main characters.

I've seen 'A New Hope' at least twenty times, 'The Empire Strikes Back' about a dozen, and 'Return of the Jedi' more than once. I've read many of the novels and to this day still collect toys and action figures. I spent eight hours in line for tickets and a seat, finally seeing 'The Phantom Menace' on the first day at 300 AM. I desperately wanted to like it, and made every attempt to make allowances and keep an open mind.But I couldn't do it. It was just too pathetic.Had this movie been made by someone else, I might not be so critical. But George Lucas has always insisted that cutting-edge effects are secondary to a good story. Too bad someone close to him doesn't remind him of this. I've heard Lucas say he hates to write. Well, it shows. Most scenes are just tedious, obligatory filler material between spectacular effects sequences. Rather than illustrate character through action and behavior, the script delegates that task to other characters to say aloud.Even though the first movies appealed to both children and adults, many defend 'The Phantom Menace' by saying it was made just for kids. But I find it hard to imagine children caring about trade disputes. And the level of violence is more suitable for teens and adults. Besides, how will these children in the audience react in a few years when their hero 'Ani' grows up, turns evil and kills everyone?Perhaps George Lucas' biggest crime is his attempt to explain the Force in scientific terms. This not only contradicted what had been established in the other films, but it eliminated the one thing that distinguished 'Star Wars' from standard science fictions films - an element of fantasy.Although all the archetypes of the original are here a wide-eyed youth, a wise mentor, an alien sidekick and a royal damsel in distress, this time it doesn't work. Keen characters and witty dialog have been replaced by potty humor and pratfalls. This will be the last 'Star Wars' film I ever see.

I've never waited so long for a movie. But here's what I think. The score lacked. These movies go together as one right. All 6 of'em will be the Star Wars Sexillogy. (or whatever). So why not use the endeared Star Wars music. The imperial death march, the Luke Skywalker music. That music gives it that Star Wars feel. Instead, trying to be different, they covered it. Made the music 'sorta like' the original music which I found was just teasing me. When they start going into the familar music and then change it that makes me go ick. (I hate puff daddy too). Comic relief. Sorry, it is not Star Wars to goof around and be cute all the time. Even the Ewoks, however cute, came to the realization of a grim fight against evil and that deal. That sense of urgency and neccessity that kept you on the edge of your seat. Jar Jar is America's Funniest Home Videos with Bob Sagett, not George Lucas's masterpiece, Star Wars. C3PO's comic relief is much better. Makes us laugh because of the character's good development in interesting situitations, not because his pants fall down when reaching for his light saber.

What was riveting about the previous movies was how in the heat of a duel precious information was given to increase the tension. As cool as the duel was it could have been so much better if Darth Maul was given lines to make him sinisterly evil. If we knew something of who he was. Scenes like Anakin going to the queen were boring. And they would string them together so you'd have one huge sequence of people talking to each other. Look to Empire. The battle of Hoth is one of the best action bits in history. And while it's going on we've got Lea and Han chit chatting. Great stuff. Lucas should have mixed and matched more with plot and action. Now, not to totally dump on the movie. It was good. But to be great and be Star Wars again Lucas has to stick with what made the first 3 great and Star Wars.

It is the realisation that this film cannot live up to all the hype it's been given. It is, none the less, at least a 9 out of 10. The movie opens strong and reveals a thrilling new display of the power of a Jedi Knight. In the fast moving first few  scenes, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn leads the apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi in a fight out of an ambush aboard a Federation Vessel. The audience is warned to buckle up for the ride to come. While the high-energy isn't constant throughout the film, the visual display is. This piece DOES live up to the rumours of fascinating new worlds and vast epic cities that leave the viewer wanting just another second to take in each scene. The unfortunate part of this story is that it is preceded by 20 years of the out-of-this-world success and popularity of its sequels. No film, however great, can compete with that in 2 hours on a Wednesday evening. It does however deliver some very memorable scenes. The most talked about surely to be the Pod Race. This thrill-ride pits young Anakin, against a miry collection of native Tatooinian creatures, in a race literally for his life. The Pods, are home made contraptions (I use that term very loosely) that are basically two afterburning jet engines towing a dune buggy frame that contains more electronics than a stealth fighter. In short, this race makes Ben Hur look like a royal wedding. Episode One covers all the bases too. The comedic Jar Jar Binks, while a little corny at times for the adult crowd, is certain to be a hit with the younger set. Unfortunately they will be driving adults everywhere battty, trying to imitate his almost baby-like pidgin English.Lucas has not lost touch with real filmmaking either. While it is clear, the emphasis on this film is special effects both visual and aural, he manages to capture our hearts with the love between a mother and son. When Anakin is freed from his slave master, his freedom ironically separates him from his only family. A bittersweet few scenes here, that don't turn on the waterworks like a Julia Roberts flick, but do manage to tug at us enough to bring us off the roller-coaster for a breather before slowly climbing back on for another big ride at the finale. This movie didn't follow the standard Hollywood cookie cutter plot. There was no predicting what will happen next. But it is also not the next great epic to be lauded for years to come. Rather, it is an introduction. The beginning of the epic story yet to be told. In the end, we are left wanting more. More of the story not really told here. More of the story yet to come.

The soundtrack was terrific (still is) and the characters had some meaningful things to say that I felt boded well with my generation.  Watching it 5 years later, the film has aged rapidly and its sometimes sour, one-note message with typical stereotypes made me shake my head in disagreement this time around.  Much like John Hughes pictures of the 80's, the situations and the dialogue surrounding the story have become dated.  It has some great moments sprinkled throughout, mostly because someone my age can relate to the heroes' plight.  It starts out as an attempt to encapsulate Generation X, but turns into a traditional love story, which, believe it or not, is well done and does not necessarily hurt the movie.  Strong performances and a nice love story save this film which could've ended up on the whatever happened to list.Winona Ryder is the idealistic beauty of this rag-tag bunch of friends that covers most young stereotypical bases (Class Valedictorian Ryder, philosophical rebel Hawke, promiscuous Janeane Garafolo, and a gay fourth member of the group who is forced into the screenplay with no significance whatsoever).  There are some great sequences after the opening credits. Good Morning, Grant, a funny send-up of cheesy morning talk-shows (take your pick) features the great John Mahoney in yet another impressive cameo. An early confrontation between budding lovers Hawke and Ryder is effective at showing the sexual tension between these two central characters.  And one of our best actresses of my generation, Winona Ryder, is sexy, sensitive, and real.  Its the Hawke character that wears thin.  He is given empty poetic anecdotes to recite as he puffs on an eternal cigarette, sounding good, making no sense.  Still, he provides enough heart to make the final passages believable and convincing.Some aspects of REALITY BITES are so hard to swallow now. Aids, Aids, Aids. Sure, its an important topic, but the Garafolo character tells us an Aids test is our generation's rite of passage.  Yeah, only for promiscuous chicks like her.  Hawke's tired monologues along with the annoying typecasting (including director Ben Stiller, who plays the much-needed dorky counterpoint to Hawke's coolness) leads us to the biggest misfire of the film.  Ryder's documentary, a simple hand-held recording of her friends smoking up and talking smack is exactly what it is.  The recording of friends with a camcorder that we have all done as well, if not better than she does.  What was so great about her work?  I guess we were supposed to be blown away by the profoundness of Garafolo's trip to the hospital to have her rite of passage on a shoddy video recording.I'm being mean, but honest.  This is not to say DON'T SEE IT.  It is worth seeing because of the acting and the great rock n' roll soundtrack.  Just forget that a class valedictorian can't find a job (yep), all baby boomers are stupid, and many other things.  One thing the film does well is constantly show TV.

This film is most effective if you grew up in the midwest\/east coast and remember those tell me a scary story campfire tales.  The film evokes an uncannily primal sense of fear through sparse visual trickery (none, really, which amounts to more style than any horror movie of the past decade, oddly enough).  Despite some spots that might be considered draggy or slow to some, this was a pleasant surprise, given the overhyped nature of other indie genre fare (PI, Cube) and anyone with a degree of patience will be immediately sucked in the moment the 3 characters enter the dense Maryland woods to unlock the secrets of the fabled Blair Witch.  Myrick and Sanchez are so good at scaring their audience with the most basic and rudimentary of aural\/visual devices it's shocking nobody's thought of this sooner.  When the final credits rolled after the numbing final scene, the hair on the back of my neck literally stood up and I felt a twinge at the base of my spine that still hasn't worked itself out.

And bring someone you love, 'cause I guarantee you'll need to be grabbin' onto someone.

This film has captured it!As a German I might have missed a word now and then, but many of the dialogues were easy to recognize from various plays, and this time they did not seem outdated, but brilliant, not over-exaggerated, but genuinely passionate and beautiful. This film has restored Shakespeare's fame for another millennium to come.And it is terrifically comical, too, and JudiDench as the Queen is plainly magnificent.

This movie proves that George Lucas is a genius director and writer.  You knew it was going to be good when the word's A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away appeared and the audience cheered like it was the winning touchdown of the superbowl. The special effects made this movie so great because you felt like this could really happen because it was so life-like.  The actors were great! Some of the best out there.  Liam Neeson & Ewan McGregor as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan were just performed like the actors really had the force & no one else could play Queen Amidala better than rising star Natalie Portman. But the most surprised portrayal was of Young Anakin played by Jake Lloyd who I heard couldn't act at all.  Nice cameos by Yoda, Jabba the Hutt, R2 & C-3PO as well.  I would most definitely recommend this movie if you haven't seen it already.  It is worth all the hype that it has received.

The movie started out with some promise, then quickly degenerated into a typical violence-mixed-with-funny-one-liners-movie, which has been done at least 7.9 million times before.I actually walked out before it ended, because I knew what would happen. Aren't people getting SICK of seeing movies that you can predict the ending to, and that insult your intelligence?Unlike most people, I don't turn off my brain when I go into the theater. Hollywood will keep recycling the same plot and action scenes because people keep paying to see it.
