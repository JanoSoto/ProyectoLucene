Yes, its hard to believe that. But, I decided to watch this film as it was obviously one of the highest rated films and certainly the title sounded quite interesting. Without knowing anything about the movie, I went in to watch it and was stunned! The first ten to fifteen minutes just introduces you to each of the juries in the most interesting way possible. You aren't introduced to them by their names, but you are to remember them by their faces and different personalities. It started off very quietly, and I'll admit...pretty boring. However, as soon as the murder issue was brought into the movie, I felt this sudden urge to watch the movie immediately from start to finish. At this point, I was in. From here on in, its all filled with tension, friendship, loyalty, justice, truth and hatred. Its the best drama film I've ever seen, and certainly remains the greatest of the Mystery films. What really makes this film stand out as an alone success? Its pretty much the way each character is introduced. '12 Angry Men' is the only film in history, that can give you whole bunches of characters and not give out their names and yet love the characters and the story. The plot is extremely simple and not too much happens, but its the way the film is executed that really stands out. If you think about it, at the end of the film not too many events happen. Its just different juries laying out their evidence to Jury 3 (mainly) about why the boy could be innocent of the crime of murdering his father. Its not a story that shows it from the boys perspective, nor any sort of action. In fact, the whole film takes place in this jury room. Wow! Other strengths about this film are the incredible dialogue sequences and the masterful acting by each and every single one of the actors. At no point did any actor slack off, not even the old man. Speaking of the old man, he, apart from Jury 8 (the main jury) is the character I liked most. I also absolutely loved Jury 3, the one who detested the boy being innocent. The acting was masterful and his performance is also extremely powerful. I also enjoyed the man who looked a lot like Peter Cushing, the one who was 'believed' to be the first to say not guilty. He seemed great, as did the foreign jury. Pretty much every character was brilliant. '12 Angry Men', overall, is a clear example that a film does not need to contain extensive amounts of special effects but its the dialogue, the plot, the characters and the acting that makes a film a success. Also, the better executed, the better the film and this film has such strength in every one of those aspects. Directors like George Lucas, should watch movies like '12 Angry Men' as well as his original Star Wars trilogy and understand what makes a good film. Its not CGI battles (not that they could've done it back then), not the action, not the stupid love story (Anakin and Padme) and definitely not stupid slapstick humor.

It is an event in history that sends a shiver down the spine . Nazi Germany lost one quarter of its total strength on the Eastern front during this one battle . That's if you can even call it a battle , the number of forces involved meant it was more of campaign . And if the scale of the battle wasn't mind numbing enough it's the conditions and ferocity of the fighting that sticks in the mind . As a young schoolboy in the 1970s I vividly remember reading accounts  that every brick in every house in every street was bitterly fought over  . Even in the 21st century with the invasion of Iraq military experts have to emphasise that the capture of Baghdad wouldn't resemble Stalingrad in anyway . In short if you want to visualize war at its most cruel and brutal pick up a history book on Stalingrad . You almost feel sorry for the bad guys . I did say  almost This is a slight problem with this cinematic account of the battle . STALINGRAD is a very well regarded German film and being a German film it feels the need to make a very clear line between good Germans who are portrayed as the ones who are conscripted in to the Wermacht who do all the fighting and dying in pursuit of Nazi ideals and bad Germans who blindly follow Nazi genocidal laws and never serve in the front line. Even the classic DAS BOOT suffers from this viewpoint . The only film that doesn't portray villains as Nazis is the Anglo German production CROSS OF IRON which has a Prussian aristocrat as the bad German . Would it not be a nice change that Germans murdering innocent people weren't necessarily goose stepping Nazis ? The truth is there were plenty of ordinary Wermacht units implicated in crimes against humanity on the Eastern front in the early 1940s For the majority of the film director Joseph Vilsmaier and screenwriter Jurgen Buscher tend to ignore politics and concentrate on making an anti-war film on a grand epic scale . They succeed too as a battalion of 400 men is quickly drained to a troop of 62 men carrying out full frontal assaults against desperate Soviet defenders . The film makers also make a very important point that Nazi Germany was a Christian nation and include a scene where a padre addresses a congregation emphasising that the Germans have God on their side where as the Bolsheviks are Godless atheists . This scene alone meant I could easily forgive the slight clichés that creep in to the film Slight clichés are easily forgiven . Unfortunately the more the film goes on the more clichés come firing at the audience quicker than a Soviet counter-attack . What become even more unforgivable is the introduction of very contrived plotting as in  Someone must do something unlikely and even more unlikely a character who they already know appears to move the plot forward  A number of people who dislike this movie have pointed out the unlikely coincidences of characters who appeared in the film earlier appear and they're right . It's not enough to destroy the film but a battle on the scale of Stalingrad to have people bumping in to each other the way it happens here strains all credibility . Likewise the final third of the film is rather static where people have existentialist discussions and feels more like a German New Wave film from Rainer Werner Fassbinder In short STALINGRAD is a film I always wanted to see since it was released almost 20 years ago . It was worth the wait . It's a sweeping epic war film and is much praised for the battle sequences . It isn't flawless and unfortunately the flaws are very easy to spot and take issue with . As it stands CROSS OF IRON still remains the best film featuring the carnage and hell of fighting on the Eastern front ","genre":null},{"date":"23 November 2012","score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The battle of Stalingrad is beyond human imagination .

I did say  almost This is a slight problem with this cinematic account of the battle . STALINGRAD is a very well regarded German film and being a German film it feels the need to make a very clear line between good Germans who are portrayed as the ones who are conscripted in to the Wermacht who do all the fighting and dying in pursuit of Nazi ideals and bad Germans who blindly follow Nazi genocidal laws and never serve in the front line. Even the classic DAS BOOT suffers from this viewpoint . The only film that doesn't portray villains as Nazis is the Anglo German production CROSS OF IRON which has a Prussian aristocrat as the bad German . Would it not be a nice change that Germans murdering innocent people weren't necessarily goose stepping Nazis ? The truth is there were plenty of ordinary Wermacht units implicated in crimes against humanity on the Eastern front in the early 1940s For the majority of the film director Joseph Vilsmaier and screenwriter Jurgen Buscher tend to ignore politics and concentrate on making an anti-war film on a grand epic scale . They succeed too as a battalion of 400 men is quickly drained to a troop of 62 men carrying out full frontal assaults against desperate Soviet defenders . The film makers also make a very important point that Nazi Germany was a Christian nation and include a scene where a padre addresses a congregation emphasising that the Germans have God on their side where as the Bolsheviks are Godless atheists . This scene alone meant I could easily forgive the slight clichés that creep in to the film Slight clichés are easily forgiven .

It's not enough to destroy the film but a battle on the scale of Stalingrad to have people bumping in to each other the way it happens here strains all credibility . Likewise the final third of the film is rather static where people have existentialist discussions and feels more like a German New Wave film from Rainer Werner Fassbinder In short STALINGRAD is a film I always wanted to see since it was released almost 20 years ago . It was worth the wait . It's a sweeping epic war film and is much praised for the battle sequences . It isn't flawless and unfortunately the flaws are very easy to spot and take issue with .

It is an event in history that sends a shiver down the spine . Nazi Germany lost one quarter of its total strength on the Eastern front during this one battle .

Easy lots of reviews from people who don't get LA, or Beverly Hills, most of all, lots, way too many, crazy, fool reviews from people literally intoxicated by the brutal Cinema of today, made only and with lots of money and useless subplots or science fictional sets they do not even get that today we must use all that crap just to cover mostly up for what's so dramatically lacking the force of genius, like in this great movie, or just a great script and solid actors, directed by a truly great director,with a vision!

Should all the credit go to the iconic You can't handle the truth! delivered with fierce confidence by Jack Nicholson? After all, the quote is so full of meanings that anyone could have had the opportunity to use it in real life. But I believe it takes more than one line to stand the test of time, so let's examine what A Few Good Men offers.The film itself is a composite of many archetypes of the courtroom dramas and to be fair, it doesn't bring anything revolutionary to the genre. It has an all-star cast with the same 'commercial' aspirations as Stanley Kramer's Judgement at Nuremberg Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland, even the 'lesser' actors give more than 'standards' performances J.T. Walsh, Kevin Pollack, Christopher Guest and a young Cuba Gooding Jr., to conclude on the acting department, even the two accused Marines were played by débutant actors, and could incorporate in their eyes, their voice and their body language the 'innocence' of men blinded by the Marines' code to the limit of psychosis.The two Marines, Lance Corporal Dawson and Private Dooney, from the Guantanamo Bay Base, are accused of having murdered a fellow Marine named Santiago, notorious for being a 'black sheep', and to make it worse, who was about to divulge some embarrassing secrets about a military mishap. They didn't want to kill the him, they only obeyed to a 'Code Red' order, a charming euphemism defining the extra-judicial punishment Marines give to each other, just like the 'soap in blanket' treatment in Full Metal Jacket. This one had tragic consequences since the private died of poisoning, and those who ordered the 'Code Red', Lieutenant Kendrick (Sutherland), himself obeying to an order from Colonel Nathan Jessup (Nicholson) denied all responsibilities. Their malevolent involvement is obvious but naturally, Jessup is a politically influent, thus untouchable, much more, he will not tolerate any tarnishing of the Marine Corps' prestige. And the case is so touchy that the defense is assigned to a young unexperienced lawyer from the Navy, Lieutenant Kaffee, played by Tom Cruise. Kaffee is another typical figure of the courtroom films, the lone rider à la Frank Galvin, Paul Newman in The Verdict or Al Pacino in &#x85; And Justice for All, who embodies the 'David against Goliath' fight, when Goliath is a big and powerful institution. And as usual, Tom starts as a cocky and obnoxious character to better redeem himself at the end, when he realizes that the scope of the trial exceed his limitations. He's seconded by a Lieutenant JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) and Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollack). Naturally, Tom Cruise and Demi Moore's looks are so distracting, that we'd all expect a romantic subplot to bloom at any moment. Thankfully, the screenplay is thick enough not to be polluted by useless conventions, although I do wonder if it was that realistic that they never flirted? Anyway, we have a powerful cast, a terrific script, a character's arc following the coming-of- age structure, the young boy who'll try to get off the shadow of his father's legend, and we have the 'David' vs. Goliath, although this time, the fight is even more meaningful since it questions the excesses of the Marines' Code. I mentioned Full Metal Jacket, well, Jessup is a 'villain' à la Gunnery Hartman, one who believes that a Marine is such a sacred figure that no one should interfere with it, an order is an order, anyone who's not with his unit, is against it, and Nicholson is so good he might even convince us. The film puts in perspectives such words like 'honor' and weighs them enough to prove that they are not abstractions, and even honor can end where fanaticism starts. On that level, it reminds of another exemplary military trial film The Caine Mutiny. Here, a a disobedience would have spared a life, this is how intelligent and thought-provoking Aaron Sorkin's script is. A Few Good Men is a really well-made, well-acted, well-scripted film that ends with a powerful conclusion even more because it comes from the accused Corporal Dawson himself, and the directing is so subtle that at that time, you can see the reaction on Pollak's face, and if you have seen the film and remembered what he said about the Marines, you can guess his exact thought. And Tom Cruise delivers one of his finest performances along with Jack Nicholson, who's never exuded such a scary aura of authority. The kind of nut that you think would be hard to crack if it's not for a magnificent display of perseverance, and a desperate quest for justice, at any cost, even the job. That's also honor, risking losing everything for our beliefs, for the same reason Dawson refused to plea guilty and compromise himself, at the end he and Kaffee are in the same wavelength.There was one flaw though Roger Ebert noticed about the script why the director included a scene where Cruise told exactly how he would tease Jessup to provoke the climactic confession. I agree it does deprive the film from a sort of 'surprise' effect but if it's not brave, it's not unrealistic either. Cruise's tactic was to awake Jessup's darker side and let him be the architect of his own demise, just like Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny, and that's what contributes to one of the most delightful ironies of the film A Few Good Men is build on a series of misleads, twists and manipulations, and at the end, flirting but never reaching the 'Deus ex Machina', the villain perishes by his own sword.The film is so well-written I didn't think at any second the exchange was unrealistic, and seriously, why dismiss the only bit of originality the film ever had?

And Tom Cruise delivers one of his finest performances along with Jack Nicholson, who's never exuded such a scary aura of authority. The kind of nut that you think would be hard to crack if it's not for a magnificent display of perseverance, and a desperate quest for justice, at any cost, even the job. That's also honor, risking losing everything for our beliefs, for the same reason Dawson refused to plea guilty and compromise himself, at the end he and Kaffee are in the same wavelength.There was one flaw though Roger Ebert noticed about the script why the director included a scene where Cruise told exactly how he would tease Jessup to provoke the climactic confession. I agree it does deprive the film from a sort of 'surprise' effect but if it's not brave, it's not unrealistic either. Cruise's tactic was to awake Jessup's darker side and let him be the architect of his own demise, just like Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny, and that's what contributes to one of the most delightful ironies of the film A Few Good Men is build on a series of misleads, twists and manipulations, and at the end, flirting but never reaching the 'Deus ex Machina', the villain perishes by his own sword.The film is so well-written I didn't think at any second the exchange was unrealistic, and seriously, why dismiss the only bit of originality the film ever had?

There should have been a sixth, Night Passage, but Mann withdrew from the project, reportedly because he was unhappy with the script and with the casting of Audie Murphy as Stewart's co-star, and the two never worked together again. (According to some versions of the story, they never spoke to one another again). Here Stewart plays Will Lockhart, the titular Man from Laramie, who leads a wagon train to the small town of Coronado, New Mexico. Lockhart, however, is not in town purely for business reasons. He also wants revenge for the death of his brother, an Army cavalry trooper, killed by the Apaches. He is seeking revenge not on the Indians themselves but on the white men who sold them rifles used in the attack. While in Coronado, Lockhart tangles with the Waggomans, powerful local ranchers. The film, in fact, is as much about this family as it is about Lockhart, and it explores their relationships in some detail. Alec Waggoman, the patriarch and an elderly widower, is an outwardly autocratic figure, but inwardly is haunted by mysterious nightmares and by the fact that he is gradually losing his eyesight. He is also troubled by the mutual dislike between his son Dave and his foreman Vic Hansbro, whom Alec regards virtually as an adopted second son. Two added complications are that Lockhart and Vic are both in love with the same woman, Alec's niece Barbara, and that Lockhart goes to work for Kate Canady, once Alec's lover and now his business rival.Two common features of the Mann-Stewart Westerns are striking photography of the Western scenery and a greater blurring of the moral boundaries between good and evil than was common in Westerns of the fifties, although this second feature was often found in other genres of the period, notable film noir. Both these features are to be found in The Man from Laramie, which was one of the first Westerns to be filmed in CinemaScope to give a sense of the wide open New Mexico landscapes. Like all the Mann-Stewart collaborations except the first, Winchester 73, it was shot in colour, part of a growing trend away from black-and- white in this particular genre. Dave Waggoman is an obvious villain- arrogant, hot-tempered and sadistic. Our first sight of him comes when, acting on very little provocation, he kills twelve mules and burns three wagons belonging to Lockhart. The other major characters, however, are more difficult to characterise as heroes or villains. Lockhart is the film's protagonist, and generally has right on his side, but he can also be angry, bitter and vindictive. Alec has a moral sense which Dave lacks, but can also be authoritarian with his workers and over-indulgent to his worthless son. In the confrontations between Dave and Vic he sides with his biological son over his adopted one, even though he is under no illusions about Dave's true character. Vic at first appears to be a rough diamond, lacking in social graces but with a sense of decency which sets him apart from the villainous Dave. We sympathise with him when he is treated unfairly by his adoptive father and he seems genuine in his love for Barbara. As the film progresses, however, Vic reveals himself to be as much of a villain as Dave, if not more so. The reviewer who drew parallels with the Gloucester subplot in King Lear should have recalled that in that play only one of Gloucester's sons, the illegitimate Edmund, proves to be a villain; his legitimate son Edgar is noble and magnanimous. Despite the unhappy ending to their relationship, James Stewart gave some of his best performances in his work with Mann, and he gives another good one here as the conflicted Lockhart, showing us the rough edges of his character but always holding our sympathy and our interest. There are also good supporting contributions from Donald Crisp as Alec, Alex Nicol as Dave and especially from Arthur Kennedy as Vic. (Kennedy was one of those gifted actors who never quite seemed to make the transition from supporting actor to leading man in his cinema career, even though he played many leading roles on stage).

It creates a bit of an uneven film, though the bumps are smoothed out by the third act.Moore seems fairly comfortable with the role, so he handles things fairly smoothly. He gets plenty of quips and quite a bit of action, and he is still young enough that he seems viable in the physical stuff. Catherine Bach has a nice turn as the Russian agent who both wants to stop the villain and kill Bond for the death of her lover. She gets to do a bit more than the average Bond girl, which is a treat. Curt Jurgens plays the villain, which appears to be a bit of a mixture of Bloefeld and Dr. No. He has cold blooded down, but doesn't quite rise to charming. He pretty much falls in the middle range of the Bond villains; not quite Goldfinger, still better than Mr. Big\/Kananga. Shane Rimmer is back as a sub captain and the MI-6 gang are around for some fun, with the Q scenes setting the tone for the next several movies, where they are played mostly for comedy. Richard Kiel makes the first of two appearances as Jaws, the first truly memorable henchman since Oddjob.The locales, as is usual, are great and they are showcased well. The stunt pieces are exciting, with the Lotus submarine car showcased at the heart. Ken Adams provides some more great sets, and the plot, generally moves right along. The only real quibble is that the early stages of the film are a bit uneven. The teaser starts things off with a bang, with the epic ski chase and parachute jump, then settles in for the exposition.

The only real quibble is that the early stages of the film are a bit uneven. The teaser starts things off with a bang, with the epic ski chase and parachute jump, then settles in for the exposition. There is intrigue in and around Cairo, but it mostly seems like marking time until we get to the bigger stuff. Too many of the stunts here are played for laughs, though nowhere near as badly as later films. Once we get Bond and Amasova on-board a US ballistic missile submarine, things really kick into high gear. The battle on-board Stromberg's ship is probably the best action sequence since the air assault on Piz Gloria, in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. There is tension, while Bond leads the combined submarine crews in an attempt at gaining control of the ship's command center and stopping the launch of multiple ICBMs. The film would also end with what would become another recurring gag Bond caught by his superiors in a compromising position. So, in the end, you get a fairly entertaining movie, though it takes a little time to get going, after the teaser. Moore is well settled in the role and has an above average leading lady and a fairly decent villain and a mcguffin worthy of 007. The comedic moments are under better control than in the last film and certainly moreso then the films that follow. You have memorable scenery and sets and outstanding stunt pieces. All in all, a strong entry in the series and certainly one of Moore's best episodes.

I absolutely hated the father - he reminded me of my late father, who was also a bully who was enraged by his lack of ability to control others completely - Om Puri gives a ferocious performance - I would be curious to know what the actor felt about his part, did he see him (as I do) as a villain or did he see him as right? I found Linda Bassett's role a bit infuriating those women who stay with their abusive disgusting husbands no matter what. I loved how rebellious the kids were, yet they stayed stuck under this tyrant's thumb. But they could escape into British culture, the neighborhood, school, music, culture that was not Pakistani. The gay son was certainly stereotypical but I still found it daring - it's rare to see a happy gay couple (who also appear to be married) in movies from before 2000. Meena's dance is wonderful and fun. Damien O'Donnell's direction makes me wish he could make more movies (I've also loved Rory O'Shea Was Here, which was originally titled Inside I'm Dancing, but his other few films don't seem to have made it over here) - his direction is incredibly self-assured and brilliant, it was his feature film debut (he had made short films and commercials previously). I especially loved the feel of the film, the production design, the street - interestingly, it was filmed at Ealing Studios, 40 years after the last of the Ealing films were produced there. While this film can get my blood boiling - I wished somebody would run the father over with a car or do anything to get him to STOP his bullying disgusting behavior. (Why is he married to her? It's a real mystery. If he's so Pakistani, why isn't he married to a Pakistani woman?) But that's what's so great about this movie it can be simultaneously infuriating AND fascinating! I absolutely loved this movie!!!

Badly written, badly directed, badly acted? All three? Certainly badly written and directed. I've read in various reviews that the writer took 5 years to write this screenplay and as a result hardly any improv was used on set. My advice would be to  (a) Never hire this writer again (but it looks like he works exclusively for Abel Ferrara anyway) (b) Maybe concentrate a bit more on the writing the next time or (C) Spend less time writing and allow improv - it might improve things.The main issue here is there seems no motivation for any of the characters - Walken is a bad guy, Caruso & Snipes are good guys - but we need a little more than that. They are so one dimensional that cardboard cutouts would have sufficed instead of the actors. Fishburne is so over the top it is comical and Buschemi has hardly any screen time. There's no build up to any of the character's motivations and as a result when we see things on screen there is no emotional involvement with the audience. Bottom line is the audience doesn't care who gets shot, killed or whatever.There is potential in 'King of New York' but in the end it fizzles out to nothing. Literally. The plot itself is simplistic in the extreme and embarrassingly step-by-step. No originality. It goes like this Frank White (Walken) gets out of prison, takes dope, has parties, wants to dabble in a hospital project and kills all his enemies. The cops then call him King of New York. Then the cops get angry with Frank and decide to kill him themselves. Queue the shooting and more shooting and finally everybody's dead.The plot could have been written by a 5 year old - never mind take 5 years to write !!!! There is no hook here, no emotional depth, no involvement, no background - nothing. It does have Walken - and his almost obligatory dancing scene - but it just looks embarrassing instead of kooky.Poor effort - 3\/10.

He chooses his roles very wisely(other than Batman and Robin of course) and that's why the Academy loves him so much. The rest of the cast led by Turturro and Blake Nelson were superb.Overall, this movie feels like a cross between The Three Stooges and the Odyssey.
