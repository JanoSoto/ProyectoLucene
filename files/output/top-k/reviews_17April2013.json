Even when some lists and reviewers have called the film one of the most over-rated classics...you can sort of understand why. I grew up on this movie, watching it again and again. But I would hazard to guess that 99% of North America know the absolutely timeless songs, and the constant barrage of famous quotes. Even watching it again, when I got to see it on the big screen which was awesome, I was shocked by how many literally epically famous quotes are from this one movie. Considering when the film was made this had to be a stunning feat for film making. The special effects lack in some aspects and then in other ways it is truly astonishing. The painting backdrop of OZ definitely looks dated, seeing it again, but then you look at something as small as the Scarecrow\/Lion\/Tin-man's make up and it is really quite astounding. The film is simply fun and a little bit dark at times creating one of the most well known villains in film history. It has a moral story to it that I actually felt was a little forced but you can't deny that the film is just beautiful and simple and fun and takes many of us back to a time of our childhood.Judy Garland was many things in her life, and I don't think I've seen her in anything other than this but she was simply angelic as Dorothy. Squeaky clean and beautiful and perfect and flawless in her role. Her voice is beautiful of course and this role easily one of the most iconic. Ray Bolger gives one of my favourite performances in films as the Scarecrow. He is terrific and bumbling and just his facial expressions and movements are brilliant. In my opinion, this would be an Oscar worthy performance. Bert Lahr is probably equally as iconic as the cowardly Lion. He certainly plays up the role and is very campy but somehow it works for the film. Sometimes I think his character was slightly overused but you can't deny he is an integral part of the cast. I always felt like Jack Haley as the Tin Man was very under-rated and under-appreciated. Its true that he doesn't stand out quite as much as everyone else but I still think his more subtle and courageous character was fun and well played. What can you say about Margaret Hamilton? Her Wicked Witch is certainly one of the most well known villains in history and for good reason. She is mean and her cackle is perfection. Nowadays you might say her witch is so stereotypical and maybe it was then too but she nails this role. She is certainly one of my favourites from childhood. I have to say that Billie Burke as Glinda has always been one of my least favourite parts of The Wizard of Oz. I would hazard to say she is downright annoying and her awful condescending tone (brilliantly and respectfully mocked by Michelle Williams in the new Oz film) was terrible. Honourable mention to both Charley Grapewin and Clara Blandick as Uncle Henry and Auntie Em who are both excellent in their roles. And finally the Wizard himself Frank Morgan who is a master of disguise playing five different roles. Morgan is very good in each of his roles and certainly captures everything that we have come to know about the Wizard of Oz.Its quite amazing reading about all the trials and tribulations this film went through to get made including multiple directors and actors in various roles. 1939 was some kind of year for director Victor Fleming who I think is a visionary and that's only from seeing Wizard of Oz and Gone With The Wind. He knows his material and he knows how to completely whisk away his audience to a completely different world and that's perfect for Oz. I could nit pick the film and find a handful of things that annoy me now...as an adult, and maybe as someone who has watched so many movies that I have become a little bit jaded but you know I'm going to go in a different direction with this review. Who am I to deny a sincere classic. This film has stood up for 70 years and given us some of the most well known music, characters, film lines and the movie is easily one of the most watchable.

That movie is terrible. OF COURSE IT IS!! It is deliciously, brilliantly terrible. It is gory, and even creepy at times and then flips flawlessly over to being downright hilarious. But in my opinion the true brilliance of The Evil Dead is when you look at it from a film making perspective...which I don't usually like to do...but this movie was essentially done on a shoestring budget with hands on special effects and gore. The cast went through gruelling conditions to bring this movie to life (no pun intended) It is the quintessential indie film. It proved and still proves that a horror film made independently by then unknowns can still be immensely successful. The story is incredibly simplistic, for the most part it is said that Sam Raimi didn't have a real script but had all the ideas in his head. There is nothing about this movie that you can say is brilliant except for the sheer fact that it was made by an incredibly talented group of young people. The script is silly, the gore is gratuitous and over the top, everything about it is simple but the film is legendary and incredibly fun to watch for horror fans.Ellen Sandweiss, Richard DeManincor, Betsy Baker and Theresa Tilly are all okay in their roles. They are a little campy in the beginning and a little stiff in line delivery but then once they're all possessed and part of the evil dead is when they all really shine especially Sandweiss and Tilly. They put their heart and soul into the movie and basically signed themselves over to Raimi and let him do whatever it was he did and they deserve kudos for that. Did they make or break the movie? No. Honestly they felt like fodder for the demons and didn't really stand out. This is perhaps the reason why The Evil Dead made Bruce Campbell a legend. We all know him now as the King of Camp but in The Evil Dead he is truly giving his very best serious performance. Yes some of it is laughable but he is so dedicated and fun to watch and there is absolutely no doubt that he has this charisma on screen that makes him riveting. He carries this movie on his back and does so perfectly. The guy is covered from head to toe with every manner of disgusting body fluid that you can imagine and he looks classy while doing it.The Evil Dead is the most fun because it tries so hard to be serious. Those who are squeamish will certainly find the gore hard to watch. Those of us who are die hard horror fans will see the dark humour in how over the top everything is. But it is is a horror film through and through. The atmosphere that Raimi created (again on virtually nothing) is brilliant. The entire setting in the cabin, the dark and creepy woods, the infamous woods raping scene is all simply twisted and disturbing and even the humour in this film is (I think) entirely unintended and comes from watching these guys have a lot of fun making a horror film. But unlike many independent horror film makers (especially nowadays) this group of people headlined by Raimi and Campbell are incredibly talented and went on to much bigger things. The Evil Dead is not for everyone but it is a classic without a doubt and true horror fans and fans of film making have to appreciate it for what it is and what it has become.

I knew nothing about Leviathan really and actually thought it was a monster movie which it really isn't. Its basically taking ingredients from a variety of 70's and 80's classic sci fi films and mixing them together and presenting us with a rip off to be honest and as many reviewers have pointed out. However, that doesn't make it less entertaining. There are certain aspects of the film that make this incredibly watchable. I love a film that can capture isolation and really use it to the utmost. Stephen King is a master of that in the literary world and a good horror movie can certainly use this element. Leviathan makes you feel claustrophobic, isolated, alone and scared. The film tries very hard to find its own footing despite having so many cloned elements of it. The film does everything decently. It never exceeds expectations and nothing is truly outstanding including the story or the characters. I will give it one exception and that is that the last fifteen minutes or so is so ridiculously 80's movie that I LOVED IT!! The amazingly perfect cheesy one liner by Peter Weller Say Ahh, mother %$#*&, Weller punching the woman at the end...it was truly awesome and stands alone as being terrific.Who knew Peter Weller did something other than Robocop? Alright I suspected that he did but I've never seen him in anything else that I can think of. Weller is...and I hate to say it and use the pun...but robotic. He is a little bland and monotone but at the same time he has that quintessential 80's hero feel to him. He does command a certain respect as leader of the team but I don't think his character gives him everything that it should have. Richard Crenna feels like the BIG name to the film. Or at least he thinks that he is. I enjoyed his character but much like Weller I felt like there should have been more. He also seemed like he was very impressed with himself the whole time (maybe that was the character?) He had good chemistry with the cast though. Daniel Stern was surprisingly good in a small role as an obnoxious womanizer who everyone still seems to like. Ernie Hudson is solid in his role and I would have liked to have seen more from him but he does a really good job with what they do give him. One of my favourite character actors Hector Elizondo gives one of the best performances in the cast as GP Cobb. I just felt like he was the most genuine (mentions his wife, shows weariness and excitement better.) I thought out of everyone he really showed the most in the film. Michael Carmine has a very small role but does decently in it. I'd like to say that either female actress in the film Amanda Pays or Meg Foster stand out but they don't. They are good, don't get me wrong but both are about the same in my books. They do an adequate job as does the entire cast.As much as the film tries to blatantly rip off the Alien franchise, it misses the mark on creating memorable characters like Ripley or Bishop. However, the film is completely entertaining! I enjoyed it very much. Any lover of sci-fi films or 80's movies can find a dozen things to truly enjoy about the movie. Is it mediocre? Yes perhaps but it is still well done. I think the film would have been a complete mess if not for the talent of director George Cosmatos who also directed First Blood Part 2...an epic 80's action flick, Cobra (under-appreciated in my book) and Tombstone. He knows how to tell a great action story, even if it is a little generic. Movies rip off other movies all the time...doesn't make them necessarily less enjoyable in my books. The underwater setting, the isolation of the mining expedition and some decent characters make this a fun, turn your brain off and enjoy flick.

In advance, I apologize for the following intellectual masturbation.Is an adaptation supposed to be a complement of the original book, or it should be regarded as a totally independent medium? Since I've seen more films than I read books, the most convenient choice is to believe in the second option. However, one of the first things I remember about the film was my father's experience, it was the first novel he read that was adapted into a film, and as much as he admired Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman, he thought the film was an insult to the book. And guess what? Many IMDb users share the same feelings, and insist that the film doesn't respect the film's narrative, and even worse, fails to vehicle the same gripping emotions, than Henri Charrière's biographical best-seller. With that in mind, I knew my appreciation would be biased, and although it didn't ruin my desire to enjoy the film, I often find myself wondering how extraordinary the reading of some paragraphs would have been. Indeed, the more I recreate in my mind, the famous 'isolation' sequence, where I remember the agonizing white-haired face of an exhausted Steve McQueen, forced to eat cockroaches and his own excrement, reaching for the thinnest light of hope as the only tunnel to existence, I know I'm missing one hell of a literary experience. I know the book would be a thrilling psychological study, inviting us to identify with a man who could only hang on his desire to escape, not to die in starvation or insanity. The Shawshank Redemption succeeded with less potential, here, even in the middle of a jungle, where the isolation is accentuated, the film is more about the escape than the human motives beneath them.Still, in that very part, McQueen's performance as the man with the Butterfly tattoo, did probably justice to the novel, as I've never felt so intensely absorbed by the pain endured by a prisoner. And the isolation part plays as a microcosm to what makes Papillon one hell of an exhaustive experience, in both the right and the wrong way.The problem is that the film is almost three-hour long, and quite irregular quality-wise, it's not the kind of prison film where each scene works alone as a classic or gets stuck in your mind, I wish it was. In its attempt to be faithful to the experience lived by Charriere, (even the fictional parts), the film covers a bit too much, victim of its own ambition. Roger Ebert's criticism sums it up quite well, when he regrets that the film spent too much time developing the friendship between Charriere and Dega (the geeky counterfeit played by Dustin Hoffman) as if Dega was significant enough to the story. Granted it's hard to picture Dustin Hoffman playing a minor role in the 70's, and since he's the one who hired Charriere as a bodyguard, and cost him his isolation by supplying him some food, he became an important element of the story. Still, between the hellish life and mental torture of a prisoner in the famous Devil's Island prison and a friendship story, the film tries to oscillates, with a clumsy editing and a result far from the developed relationship between Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in Shawshank.The result is therefore uneven we're grabbed by the story, the setting is realistic enough to hook us immediately to the prisoner's experience, and its exoticness conveys a thrilling sense of danger that makes even the escape a debatable option. But there comes a moment at the end, where all we wait for is the nightmare to stop. As said Ebert (I'm still saddened by his recent passing, so it's only fitting to quote him) we don't want the prisoners to escape for their own freedom but just so the film could be over. And I don't even detect sarcasm in this remark, for even the best-looking and best-acted films can reach a no-return point in the viewer's attention span. Papillon, after nineteen intense minutes, turns out to a series of misfortunes, so repetitive they are tragicomically frustrating, from a well-crafted escape that end up in a unseaworthy boat, from a long trip in a indigenous tribe's camp to the capture by South-American soldiers, to the providential help of a nun that leads him to another arrest, we start to wonder when the hell is going to get off that one, and this is a selfish feeling too.And another sad consequence is that no matter how great Steve McQueen is, there are five minutes that are totally unwatchable when they discover that they can't take the boat, McQueen's acting is inversely proportional to the wonderful scene where he has a nervous breakdown and can't tell the guards who gave him the food. To those who wonder why he didn't get the Oscar, maybe that scene cost him the award. I still give the film an 8, because I enjoyed it, and still regard the isolation part as some of the best movie scenes from any other prison movie. But I know that sooner or later, I will read the book, and my opinion might be more severe. Is Papillon one of the best movies of the 70's, one of the most memorable, yes, the highlight of Steve McQueen's career, probably. An unforgettable experience? At some parts, yes.

The main character Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) gets told that he doesn't have long on this earth, while he simultaneously has to question his very sanity and even his existence. This is shown to have the effect of releasing him from his bonds, allowing him to express himself in ways he has never before realized. In a way you could say that he was happier during that final month or so than he was ever before. Except that he's constantly plagued by the knowledge of what might come. The film's atmosphere is very dark, with muted colours and uncomfortable, yet occasionally sweet scenes.So what went wrong? The time travel aspect mostly. The thing about a plot device as complex as time travel is that it pretty much always requires a lot of explanation to pull off. The audience needs to know why something travels through time, what caused it. In Back to the Future it's explained to be the work of a brilliant scientist. In The Terminator it's future technology. Sometimes it's magic. In Donnie Darko it sort of just happens, which is always a terrible choice. Some films get away with it through the use of humour - the randomness of it is dismissed with a shrug. Donnie Darko however spends a significant amount of its running length talking about the methodology of time travel, yet explaining very little.

Of course a mystery left open is sometimes a valid plot device, but it needs to be brought into the story just right or it ends up being frustrating, like in this case. Though to be fair I've read that the director's cut is better in this aspect, so perhaps there's still hope for this movie.Aside from that major aspect, I think the movie's OK. I'm not crazy about any of the performances, but the main actors are good at what they do. Gyllenhaal especially is very believable in his role, even though he comes off very detached and nonplussed.

Crash is most likely to leave viewers speechless, even those who are used to weird or unconventional. None of the scenes are gratuitous however, and Crash looks extremely stylish, as well as twisted enough to make one uneasy. Fortunately, this isn't 'cheap shocks' and the usual exploitation fare filmmakers throw in to stir some controversy.Perverted addicts leading corrupt lives never been more fascinating. These people are craving some basic fulfillment, but are doomed to never achieve it in life. Metaphysical allegory? Probably. It's also a cold analysis of self-destructive compulsion. What's offensive is that these characters never even stop to consider the moral implications of their actions - hurting others who don't share their hobby. Even if they did, it wouldn't make much of a difference, because they simply can't stop. Like Lynch, Cronenberg doesn't spoon-feed the message to the audience, so there are no answers, only uncomfortable but equally valid questions. I guess it takes guts to ask them. Dialogue is minimal and clever, and keeps the characters sealed. The narrative is filled with long pauses, eerie metallic riffs, empty glances directed inwards. Physical encounters are depersonalized and compulsive. There are always people around at the scene of sexual encounters or car crashes, and yet nobody bothers to notice or intervene. It's a surreal landscape of urban alienation that associates with voyeurism. Steel-cold (the unsettling score hits the right note as well), clinical in its depictions, Crash has a clean sharp edge that only a handful of directors could walk on with such elegance, insight and a sort of detachment that has a dream-like quality.All the actors are fearless and did a splendid job, especially James Spader, who is great as usual. He was born to play this role, with his other-worldly, strangely absent stare and androgynous beauty (It's surprising David Lynch never worked with him!). Spader's surreal performance is mind-blowing, as he gracefully carries along that creepy Cronenberg vibe. This is the same Spader who stole the show as the intriguing voyeur in Sex, Lies and Videotape and who would later do it again in the offbeat Secretary. His other roles just didn't do justice to him. Likewise, Deborah Unger manages to turn into an abstraction, whispering her lines, floating in the same trance of addiction.The sexual scenes are elegantly choreographed. It's bizarre, disturbing and at times funny altogether, with a pretty sick sense of humor that's absolutely fantastic to a minority of people who can appreciate it. Crash explores sexual compulsion in a sterile environment, you can almost taste the metal. This is Cronenberg's best work and one of the most fascinating, audacious films ever made. Clearly not for everybody, but for those who enjoy the Absurd in all its complexity. Unforgettable cult classic to be watched in the uncut version.

None of the scenes are gratuitous however, and Crash looks extremely stylish, as well as twisted enough to make one uneasy. Fortunately, this isn't 'cheap shocks' and the usual exploitation fare filmmakers throw in to stir some controversy.Perverted addicts leading corrupt lives never been more fascinating. These people are craving some basic fulfillment, but are doomed to never achieve it in life. Metaphysical allegory? Probably. It's also a cold analysis of self-destructive compulsion. What's offensive is that these characters never even stop to consider the moral implications of their actions - hurting others who don't share their hobby. Even if they did, it wouldn't make much of a difference, because they simply can't stop. Like Lynch, Cronenberg doesn't spoon-feed the message to the audience, so there are no answers, only uncomfortable but equally valid questions. I guess it takes guts to ask them. Dialogue is minimal and clever, and keeps the characters sealed. The narrative is filled with long pauses, eerie metallic riffs, empty glances directed inwards. Physical encounters are depersonalized and compulsive. There are always people around at the scene of sexual encounters or car crashes, and yet nobody bothers to notice or intervene. It's a surreal landscape of urban alienation that associates with voyeurism. Steel-cold (the unsettling score hits the right note as well), clinical in its depictions, Crash has a clean sharp edge that only a handful of directors could walk on with such elegance, insight and a sort of detachment that has a dream-like quality.All the actors are fearless and did a splendid job, especially James Spader, who is great as usual. He was born to play this role, with his other-worldly, strangely absent stare and androgynous beauty (It's surprising David Lynch never worked with him!). Spader's surreal performance is mind-blowing, as he gracefully carries along that creepy Cronenberg vibe. This is the same Spader who stole the show as the intriguing voyeur in Sex, Lies and Videotape and who would later do it again in the offbeat Secretary. His other roles just didn't do justice to him. Likewise, Deborah Unger manages to turn into an abstraction, whispering her lines, floating in the same trance of addiction.The sexual scenes are elegantly choreographed. It's bizarre, disturbing and at times funny altogether, with a pretty sick sense of humor that's absolutely fantastic to a minority of people who can appreciate it. Crash explores sexual compulsion in a sterile environment, you can almost taste the metal. This is Cronenberg's best work and one of the most fascinating, audacious films ever made. Clearly not for everybody, but for those who enjoy the Absurd in all its complexity. Unforgettable cult classic to be watched in the uncut version.

Of course the first movie didn't follow the original story much at all aside from a few nods, it was a decent action movie that left plenty of room for a promising sequel. MKA is an atrocious piece if work, however, and I would've rated it lower had I not wanted to like this film due to its vast (yet ultimately unrealized) scope and its (rather pathetic) attempt at integrating much of the storyline from MK2 and MK3 (along with a mutated and ineffectual pinch of MK4 - Raiden, I am your father! said Shinnok.)One major flaw is the sharp decline in acting quality. The first film featured some rather austere performances, but they were punctuated with bits of humor and as much emotion and likability one could expect. Only 2 actors return to MKA and neither are given much of a chance to act due to the endless fights and near complete lack of exposition. The rest of the cast alternates between cheesed out stereotypes and the brainlessly bland. Remar gives an exceptionally terrible performance as Raiden. Instead of the witty, mysterious, and sarcastic god given to us by Lambert, we have a puny weakling who tries to utter profound wisdom to our warriors but generally spits out complete nonsense. And when he's not doing that, he's giving out preschool-level speeches about love and unity and inner strength. Lets not forget the villains that speak with such pomp and bombast that they sound like a 13 year old level 27 dungeon lord of the 5th plane of the abyss.Of course the script is equally to blame. None of the dialog even remotely resembles human speech. I do sort of like how some story elements are used, but the problem is that they play no role in the central plot because that is one thing the writers totally ignores and destroyed. The games take place in such a rich mythology that I can't understand the need for hacking it up so badly. We have a huge number of characters with zero relevance, and big bad Shao Khan was a huge misfire. It's just some bulked up moron, no resemblance to the accomplished warrior, cunning sorcerer, seasoned general, and mysterious god-like being from the games. He's just a goon with other goons absent any clear motivation.I could forgive the murder of the storyline had a compelling film been made but its too full of nonsense to think of anything other than how it might've been made better by the inclusion of key plot points out of the games. It's fun to see characters I love come to life but equally disturbing to see such egregious mistreatment. MKA fails to honor its source and perhaps more importantly fails at being a coherent film. Most of it is one brainless fight after another with zero explanation or context interspersed with Raiden's infantile musings on hope and humanity and atrocities like the animality or, for instance, whenever any character speaks to another. Beloved combatants pop in and out of the film, while others exist only to die unceremoniously, there are far too many maniacal laughs from villains and the good guys are so wooden that you'll be wishing you'd been the victim of a gruesome fatality by the time MKA is over.I've seen that tattoo before, on a robot.

The plot may be a bit muddled in places, but the sheer joy and fun of the fantasy material makes up for it. The animated sequences in particular are a real joy, as is the comedy-action climax to the film. Some of the songs are underrated classics, in particular The Age of Not Believing and The Beautiful Briny. Also, the elaborate opening credit sequence is gorgeous to look at.That said, you may want to be careful which version of the film you see. The film premiered at around 135 minutes, but was cut down for general release to 117 minutes. This 117 minute version was the one I first saw as a child. In 1996, Disney restored the film to a length comparable to the premiere version, and this is what was released onto DVD. Ironically, I think the film does run better at a shorter length. Much of what is added are new or extended musical numbers, as well as the extension of a rather superfluous subplot involving a somewhat saucy vicar. I don't particularly find the new musical numbers that engaging, and the numbers that are extended aren't that great. Though there are some interesting extra verses in the extended Portobello Road number, the several dance scenes added to it renders it seemingly unending. Eglantine also goes on a bit too much for my liking. In addition some re-dubbing was required for some of the new scenes as the original mastertracks were not found. Angela Lansbury was able to come back and sounds fine, but many of the other actors weren't and the results are mixed.It would be nice if an inevitable Blu-Ray showed the film in either two of its versions, or if at least the original dialogue tapes were found for the extended scenes. I do believe that there are still ways to get hold of the 117 minute version. I have the first UK DVD release from around 2002, but I have read on Amazon that a later UK release has the film run at 117 minutes in order to align itself with some old European dubs on the disc, and I've also read online that TCM in the US sometimes shows the shorter version. In any case, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun, family classic and easily worthy of my recommendation.

Whilst on shift together, there is a murder in the shop where they are working. Due to the circumstances of the murder, Lyons and Karue are initially framed for the murder - (the victim gets shot, but Lyons had his back turned and didn't hear the gun fire and Karue couldn't see the person who fired the gun so technically neither of them 'witnessed the murder')What follows is an hilarious sequence of events in which Lyons and Karue set out to find the person responsible for the murder and at the same time try to prove their innocence. The murderer also has their own agenda when they discover that a gold coin (which is meant to be delivered to their boss in a suitcase with some additional equipment has gone missing and they attempt to track it down).Both Pryor and Wilder are fantastic in their respective roles (as I mentioned above I felt that Pryor stole the show as Karue and I felt he gave a better performance - if you look at his eyes throughout the film he genuinely does look as though he is blind which just shows how talented he was. Wilder was also good, but he didn't come across as being quite as convincing as Pryor. Kevin Spacey gave a great performance in an early role as the villainous Kirgo and Joan Severance is his accomplice - her performance as Eve I felt was merely adequate.

I'm a huge Eastwood fan and this film worked for me pretty well. It was funny, had plenty of cool moments and showed why you don't mess the Man with no Name. But I would be lying if said that it's any good.Eastwood does a great job in a more comedic role. He manages to combine his tough guy persona with his newly found comedic persona flawlessly. Watching him punch people is like watching Jun Ji-Hyun acting. It's endless amounts of joy and entertainment. The rest of the cast are a mixed bag. Ruth Gordon brings some laughs here and there, the standout scene being when she shoots the biker gang with a shotgun. Geoffrey Lewis and Beverly D'Angelo are pretty good and share wonderful chemistry together and Sondra Locke is painfully mediocre. I don't have anything against her as an actress because I really liked her in Sudden Impact, but she really just feels overshadowed by other people constantly. The rest of the cast are fairly forgettable. The only cool moment was to see Hank Worden, legendary western character actor. He is presence is always welcome.Every Which Way But Loose was directed by James Fargo who did The Enforcer and Forced Vengeance with Chuck Norris. He does a fine job directing and keeps things going. The action is well choreographed and well shot. You can see what's going on just fine and the film itself has a nice look to it. The only real problem is the script. There isn't much of a plot to be had. It's more like a road movie but the first half wasn't a road movie. Basically, Every Which Way But Loose is a episodic mess without any real goals or resolutions to be had. While it's a fun ride, it feels 20 minutes too long and was bad need for some trimming. Or just add some plot and stakes to keep the audience engaged.If you like Eastwood punching people, country music, monkeys, Ruth Gordon shooting bikers and Eastwood punching people you will enjoy Every Which Way But Loose.

It's entertaining to be sure, but not very good.

It's overloaded with over the top action scenes, excessive shootouts and insanity that would make John Woo proud. There is nothing really much beyond that and it completely relies of Eastwood's charisma and skill as a director to carry this nonsense.And he does it without breaking a sweat. Clint Eastwood gives his usual gruff, tough guy performance which works well with the painfully mediocre Sondra Locke. Her performance was fine I guess, but a more likable and charming screen presence would have been more welcome. Jessica Lange, Isabelle Adjani or Season Hubley and if you want to remake it, cast Jun Ji-Hyun in it. Or just about anyone who has more likable screen presence. The rest of the cast pretty much did nothing. The villains were over the top, the cops very goofy and so on and so forth. You practically spend all the time with Eastwood and Locke so there isn't any major supporting rules there.Like I said before, Eastwood is both the star in front of the camera as well as behind it. The Gauntlet is very well executed and shot flawlessly. The action is engaging and goes for just enough time to not get repetitive. The highlight of the film being the helicopter-bike chase scene. It goes at good speed and never drags for too long. Some of the more quieter scenes are less engaging since we have to listen to more Sondra Locke acting tough, which isn't the least bit entertaining. But aside from that, the action is fun, it's vulgar, bloody and mindless fun.The Gauntlet is a must see for anyone who likes Clint Eastwood. It's hardly his best work in action genre and is a fairly minor entry in his legendary career. But for all it's problems, The Gauntlet is very good fun for those who can enjoy these kinds of films.

Fans of the He-Man cartoons also complain that it does not adhere very closely to the continuity of those cartoons. The latter charge has already been answered elsewhere that this movie is, in fact, based more on the minimal storyline of the mini-comics that originally came with the toys than the animated series that was later plotted around those same toys. Hence, we have mainly just He-Man and Skeletor and some of their inner circles of friends and allies and no Prince Adam or other characters and identities later developed for the animated series.Such creative decisions, as with particularly the decision to replace Orko with Gwildor for the live-action movie, were doubtless motivated partially by adaptive pragmatism and partially by budget concerns. Whereas whipping up a believable live-action facsimile of Orko would be ridiculously easy with the computer graphics technology of our times, this just would not have been feasible for most special effects departments back in 1987. Moreover, that the costumes and equipment the characters use in the live-action movie don't entirely match the ones in the cartoons is surely due to adaptive pragmatism as well as pointed out in one of the live-action X-Men movies, it would hardly have been a good idea to dress all the mutants there in the same brightly-colored skin-tight spandex they wore in the comics and cartoons. In fact, the lighting and coloring of Masters of the Universe actually does give it a credibly cartoonish look for a live-action movie, and the director makes it clear on the DVD's commentary track that he and the cast and crew bent over backwards to achieve this effect by shooting most of the movie at night; looking at the finished product, one can see this effort paid off beautifully.As for the charges of plagiarizing from Star Wars, that Star Wars itself plagiarizes heavily from (or, as Hollywood prefers to say, is inspired by) other sources is fairly well known. What not so many of these critics realize is that Master of the Universe was actually inspired by a great many of the same sources as Star Wars. Try playing tracks from the classical composer Gustav Holst's The Planets intermingled with music from the Star Wars and Masters of the Universe soundtracks, and suddenly you'll realize that Bill Conti was not ripping off John Williams; rather, Conti and Williams were both plagiarizing from Holst. As for the characters and plots of each film, Marvel and DC's lawyers would likely have sued anyone who'd admit this into oblivion, but Star Wars and Masters of the Universe obviously both draw heavily from a lot of Jack Kirby's early Silver Age comics with their grotesque monsters and armies of invading alien stormtroopers, particularly the ones in which a power-hungry tyrant from a metallic and highly technologically advanced dystopian planet seeks out a mysterious source of cosmic power that can give him god-like control over the entire universe, aided by mindless hordes of minions and squads of quirky and monstrous super-powered warriors all seeking to curry favor with him; but enough about Darkseid and Jack Kirby's Fourth World stories.On its own merits, apart from all its predecessors, is Masters of the Universe any good? On the whole, I'd have to say yes. Frank Langella's Skeletor clearly enjoys chewing the scenery at every opportunity, as does Detective Lubic, who's remarkably competent at his job even if he's a bit of a dick about it at times. Robert Duncan McNeill's performance as Kevin neatly foreshadows the same level-headed plain-spoken charming personality he would later bring to his roles as Nick Locarno and then Tom Paris in the Star Trek franchise, Courteney Cox is sweet and vulnerable as Julie, Meg Foster demonstrates considerable ruthless competence as Evil-Lynn in bringing a woman's touch to Skeletor's efforts to retrieve Gwildor's other cosmic key, and even Billy Barty does a decent job being the plucky comic relief as Gwildor. Dolph Lundgren, while playing a rather flat character with minimal dialogue, earns his paycheck by flexing those muscles and swinging that sword at every opportunity, and Skeletor's mercenary squad and stormtroopers are believably menacing and dangerous even though He-Man and his pals end up wiping the walls with them.While a remake is rumored to be in progress now, I strongly doubt it will be able to improve much on this movie. Though the constraints of its relatively low budget do show in places and it has not aged as well as it might, Masters of the Universe is an enjoyable sword-and-sorcery space opera better than most of the kid-vids of its time and still well worth a viewing.

French society has spawned some of the greatest artists, and quite frankly, look around. The dazzling coffee shops, the architecture of Paris, the salient Eiffel Tower, and the picturesque scenery are all examples that reflect the artistry that is driven by these people. Breathless, a film made at the start of exploitation in 1960, effectively makes a statement about the ever changing world and about French artistry at its finest.The film's story was conceived by Francois Truffaut who directed Les Quatre cents coups. Truffaut has a talent for realism behind the silky black & white; Breathless is a successful experimentation of that. It is edited and directed in a contemporary quick-cut style that inevitably reminded me of David Fincher and Martin Scorsese. And while cinema has progressed in precision, Breathless yields a distinctive filmmaking style that is totally endearing.The film is borderline style over substance, but I'm thankful that the collaboration between Truffaut and Goddard found a solid equilibrium. It follows an impetuous scoundrel named Michel Poiccard. Michel is a self-described A-hole. This argument gives him reason to exude little to no remorse for the people around him. It also permits him to take life as easily as possible. He's a ramshackle character who steals francs and cars like he's switching cigarettes. The accessories may always change, but not Michel. Goddard makes a vivid point early in the film where Michel stumbles outside of an American cinema, mumbling Bogie's name as he lights a cigarette and fumbles at his lips, as if in a reverie. These idiosyncrasies are not innate but influenced by Western cinema. Michel has seen one too many movies as he dodges the cops, crassly handles women and carelessly occupies the lives of others.One such life is a young multilingual journalist named Patricia. Michel tantalizes and lusts after her. Maybe it's because she's fluent in different languages. Maybe it's because she's pretty, but Patricia denies this cosmetic cause, citing Michel to have lusted after dozens of prettier women. I think it's because she's an American. The unscrupulous cad tries cross-culturing Patricia with his frank cynicism and constant swindles. Patricia is wooed, but only so slightly. Her knowledge of French culture is limited to a learned education of Chevalier and Lafayette. Maybe it's Michel's outlandishness that attracts her. She remains on the defensive for the duration of the film, often succumbing to his riley charms before making a detrimental decision in the end. (By the way, that scene elapses in a photography studio. Can the French get any more artistic?). The lovers are unusually paired, but effective in this case. The male is a Westernized Frenchman, the woman is a French-influenced American. They are from opposite spectrums of their own cultures but uniformly alike when they are together. For that, I commend the writing.Breathless is a mural of jazz, sex and crime, served with an artistic twist and finished with a photogenic ambiance.

His fight scene with Chuck Norris is the film's highlight, but even that is filled with nonsense. Why, exactly, is there a little cat that the director feels compelled to cut to every 30 seconds? When there is a dramatic zoom-in, zoom-out on Lee and Norris, we get another close-up of the cat, ZOOMING IN AND OUT OF IT! Why?! (And thankfully, Chuck Norris would realize he looks better in a beard, and spare us shots of his hairy shoulders.) In terms of fighting, Way of the Dragon is a good watch, but so many pointless shots could simply have been, and should have been, cut. I'm almost positive the makers of The Hangover watched this film, as the main henchman could very well be Leslie Chow's cousin. He adds some comedic elements, but apart from him and the fighting scenes, Way of the Dragon isn't even an unravelled patch on Enter The Dragon.

Scorsese is a historian when it comes to the setting of any of his films. The Age of Innocence is one of his most refined movies. The décor of the 19th century, the languages and accents of its people, and even the fine dining instruments are all accounted for. In many ways, Scorsese's eye for detail is a wakeup call for contemporary New Yorkers today. The Age of Innocence is meaningful in title and it acts as a precursor, in Scorsese-lore, to the myriad of other New York pictures the director would collect in his repertoire.Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a humble New Yorker and a lawyer in his profession. It is a profession that rivals entrepreneurs, aristocrats, bankers, and architects; there is no hostility among the men, but they fraternize as if they were Gods. Although Archer appears well situated and indignant, he is actually suffering profusely inside from the suffocation and inexorable norms of high society. This characterization fits well with Scorsese's usual motifs. In The Age of Innocence, Newland Archer is an insider looking out. One of the outsiders that catches Archer's attention is Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), the cousin of his fiancé May (Winona Ryder). Ellen flouts high society and as a result is the topic of malevolent gossip that pervades the closely knit families.Archer falls for Ellen but cannot abandon his feelings (or image) for May Welland. Matters complicate when Ellen wishes to divorce her husband and Archer must facilitate the separation with legality. Between all of these stressful emotions, he only wants to be with and to love Ellen until the very end. But reality is merciless. Ellen remains an angelical dream to Archer throughout the film. He goes on with his duties deadpanned. All the while Ellen slips in and out of his desires. But there is a problem here. Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer never convinced me that they were truly radiant for each other. Perhaps that's how extra-marital affairs were run in the old fashioned days&#x97;inconspicuous and strained. But Archer's affections for Ellen to endure a lifetime (even after having many children) become too Shakespearean even for Scorsese to translate. Ellen became an alibi for Archer to leave the life of ritzy, high society.Nevertheless, The Age of Innocence will not disappoint any Scorsese fan. It's pleasant to the eye, and the aesthetics of the camera movement (from the graceful tracking shots to the zoom ins) are unusually effective in illustrating a period piece stereotyped for BBC territory. Despite being a period piece, the themes here are also relative to Scorsese (from the social outcast to the importance of family). I think Scorsese effectively created a film that embodied some of New York's oldest social statuses. It was the constipated love story that hampered Scorsese's direction. Maybe unrequited love is universal, but this is the age of innocence.

Using the skills he learned over the two Godfather movies, Coppola hones in on an evocative, psychological thriller that has the hypnotism of Vertigo and the shock factor of Psycho. But past the homage, this is entirely Coppola's own.Set in 1974 about surveillance and suspicions, it's appropriate to recall the Watergate scandal. Former President Nixon was notorious for wiretapping conversations to gain a political advantage. The same sort of tactic was used by the reporters who exposed Watergate, and then Nixon resigned. I'm not talking politics. I'm talking about how Coppola's script raises awareness about phone tapping, eavesdropping, surveillance and espionage. I suppose that The Conversation could have been set in any decade, but that it's the 70s makes the story particularly influential.The plot is a mystery but the story is a character study. Harry Caul makes his living as a surveillance expert, but outside of work, it's not much of a living. He's over 40, lives in a quaint but lonely apartment in San Francisco, prefers his own gadgets over the ones on the market and sacrifices a possible relationship all for his work. One day he hears something over a tape recording that raises his hairs.There's no denying Caul's a professional, as are his colleagues. They profit off of defaming and humiliating public officials through their savvy surveillance. This is a business where lies are exposed but the ones pulling the veil walk away with heavier wallets. But this does not necessitate a clean conscience. Unlike his peers, Caul has a guilty conscience. In New York City, 1968, his surveillance expertise caused the deaths of three people. The press called it a homicide, knots were tied and people walked away rich. Caul was one of them.Not wanting to repeat that accident, Caul starts to distrust everyone around him after hearing the new tape. Caul is cautioned not to interfere; surveillance work should be objective. But Caul gets personal. I'm not afraid of death, Caul says. But I am afraid of murder. He refuses to speak to anybody and demands to see his employer in person, whom he fears is a tyrannical figure that will upend his young wife. The mystery is handled consummately, like Double Indemnity from a different perspective. Up until the earth-shattering climax, Coppola had me guessing the whole way.It's important to remember the very end of the movie, after the mystery, which reminds us that we're watching a character study. Too often the murder mystery genre has static protagonists whose only goal is to solve the case, from A to Z. Not here. Caul, alone in his apartment with his tenor sax as his only solace, reaches new levels of paranoia. Is he being watched? Will there be repercussions? The consequences both literally and symbolically test Caul's faith.The Conversation is a thoughtful character study wrapped in a murder mystery. It is a triumph of story, sight and sound. It lost Best Picture to The Godfather Part II, also directed by Coppola. That may have been the obvious win but not the most deserved.
