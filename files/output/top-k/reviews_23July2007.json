[{"date":"23 July 2007","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" All About Eve is written with a consistent attention to stylization and lyrical perfection given to its dialogue. Whether it is truly realistic or blatantly theatrical is not a decision between a flaw and a pro, but between the nature of dialogue that is normally striven for by a logical writer and what could be beyond that nature and perhaps some new, inventive little flare, something to keep the audience determinedly on their toes. The film is loaded, and neatly limited modestly at the brim, with powerhouse scenes of dialogue, be they fiery arguments between infamous flamethrower Bette Davis and a co-star who dares to match her or dangerous, hardly predictable scenes tossed with threats and lies between others. To me, beyond the cast, beyond the direction, beyond the atmosphere of the scenery and cinematography, director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's script is what makes this movie the powerful light-refracting gem that it is.I will admit that this is my first Bette Davis film. I had never seen a performance by her before this film. I believe she has a mixture that always turns me on to an actor actress, a mesh of an extroverted, active, dynamic quality that allows them to act upon people and surroundings extremely quickly and with no inhibition and an intuitive, deeply emotional characteristic that may even negate the shallow emotional characteristic of the aforementioned quality, revealing a penetrating insight into people. Davis conveys this in the least challenging and most entertaining way, which is by playing herself, which is perfectly fine by those who judge that sort of thing because that is truly what was required of the role. She is not the light-refracting beauty one expected from a star actress in the silver screen era, but I believe she was still an untouchable star not only because of pure confidence but confidence so solid that one like Joan Crawford who would attempt to tamper with it would be thrown back as if it were a forcefield. What presence she has.Anne Baxter plays the title character, a character who is supposed to be Bette's match. As an actress, Baxter could never match Bette. Where Bette is completely natural in every way on screen, Baxter is not at all. Baxter looks and feels staged to us, because she endlessly stares off into nothing whenever she is speaking, and no matter how interesting she makes her monologue, she still unrealistically stares, and sometimes leans, into space. However, her saving grace is how beautifully she executed the very difficult and tricky role she played. Eve is a person who can never appear to be doing what other characters suspect that she's doing, and even more, she can never appear to be the sort of person that would ever feel inclined to do what they suspect that she is doing. She is the most secretive sort of mysterious personality, quite insightfully captured by the screenplay, which I once again complement, and also fleshed out very effectively by Anne Baxter, who despite her hopeless overtheatrical habits completely becomes Eve.The cast is consistently great. Celeste Holm as a playwright's housewife, a very honestly written character, is very effective in her fleshing it out. Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, and Gregory Ratoff are all very entertaining and likable. The doosie is Marilyn Monroe, who even with her few minutes on screen is very wooden. The outstanding man in the film is George Sanders, who plays theater critic Addison De Witt, one of the most intelligent and refreshingly practical and analytical characters I've seen in a movie. He is introduced as simply another one of the many people we will be seeing in the social circle of the film's main characters, even through the story he is partially narrating. Yet he slowly grows to be something more, and we are surprised to see the full extent of what his character is significant for. Sanders has a scene where he is disturbing and vindicating to us at the same time.All About Eve is full of what so many people don't seem to realize can be the most satisfying and fascinating quality a movie can have, in its writing, in its actors, in its direction, in its detail, and that is a razor wit to wield. It has all different brands of smarts, and we need more films like it today.

Allen plays Harry Block, a famous writer suffering from the writer's block and also from inability to survive in real world, to be happy and to make the people in his life happy, Six shrinks later, three wives down the line, and I still can't get my life together. Harry can't get his life together but he can write and he has put himself and all people he knows including his wives, friends, girl-friends, and his sister into his last novel. His art imitated life so closely that real people recognized themselves in the fictional characters very easily and now Harry lives through the nightmare of confronting near everybody he has ever known as well as the fictional characters, offended, infuriated, and insulted, who all rush in anger to face him You have no values. With you it's all nihilism, cynicism, sarcasm, and orgasm. By its structure,Deconstructing Harry reminds the earlier film by one of Allen's favorite directors, Ingmar Bergman, Wild Strawberries. As Professor Borg, Harry Block travels by car to upstate New York, where his college that expelled him as an undergraduate now wants to honor him as a world renowned belletrist. He travels by car with three unlikely companions, a hooker, a friend with bad heart, and his 9-years-old son whom he had kidnapped from school. As in Wild Strawberries, Allen's film provides sincere, intelligent, and emotional contemplations of life's disappointment, regrets, and losses but at the same time, it is hilarious as only Allen's films can be. One of the best scenes of the film is Harry's descent on the elevator to air-conditioned Hell where in the ninth circle he meets the Devil who looks very much like Billy Crystal. Another wonderful scene concerns a married couple where after thirty years of happy uneventful marriage a wife learns some interesting eating habits from her husband's previous life. I can go on for long time. As often in the case of Allen's movies, with the modest running time of 96 minutes, Deconstructing Harry is expertly shot, boasts an amazing cast (Billy Crystal, Judy Davis, Bob Balaban, Elisabeth Shue, Demi Moore, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tobey Maguire, and Stanley Tucci just to name a few), and is in my opinion one of the most interesting and personal Allen's films.

Back at the time, I was a 21 year old soldier, serving my third and last year of obligatory service in the Israeli army, counting the days left until I could be a civilian again. Anyway, I remember coming home one Friday after two weeks at the army, and I was all tired and worn out. Luckily enough, my ex-Girlfriend (we just started dating at the time) insisted we go out for dinner and a movie. I could still taste the gourmet meal I ate, and smell the popcorn that greeted me upon entering the theater. Needless to say, I wasn't the film buff I am now back then, and I entered Lilo & Stitch without any previous knowledge about what to expect.After all this time, I still don't know if it was the whole atmosphere of the brief vacation from the army or the fact it was an over the top animated masterpiece from the get go. As anyone would tell you from personal experience, it's all subjective anyway. Fact of the matter is, I instantly fell in love with the film and its lovable characters. The story of an alien being (cute and cuddly as he may be) who is stranded in a place miles away from home made me relate to my own personal status, having to serve in the hot and humid southwest area of Israel, hundreds of kilometers from my own home. Once I was there, feeling for the ridiculous looking Stitch, I soon developed a gradual empathy to Lilo, the little girl who adopted Stitch after mistaking him for a dog, as I myself am an orphan, and I can see why she needed a dog to share her emotions.Now mix all this with the hilarious animation, numerous likable side characters, beautiful Hawaiian setting, refined Elvis Priestly soundtrack, and you got yourself a winner. Lilo & Stitch manages to be silly and intelligent both at once, and to this day makes me laugh and cry simultaneously (I obviously own it on DVD). It's the last traditional animation outing that was a big hit at the box office as well (if memory serves me right, it earned nearly 150 million dollars in the US alone), and there's an obvious reason for that. Like Shrek 1&2, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo and other 3-D CGI animation films, it keeps its plot simple and easy to follow, when all the while manages to pay gestures to older films and themes us grown ups can relate to; thus really living up to the cliché that insists a G rating is for everyone from 4 to 90 9or something like that).As you can tell, I first and foremost fell in love with this film for sentimental reasons, but at the end of the day, what made me watch it again and again over time was its original mix of Sci-fi and traditional animation, unbelievable funny scenes (try watching Stitch running over the toy model of San Francisco and tell me you didn't laugh) and simple morals of family and friendship. Either way you turn it, Lilo & Stitch is a keeper. They truly don't make them like this anymore.

It's the last traditional animation outing that was a big hit at the box office as well (if memory serves me right, it earned nearly 150 million dollars in the US alone), and there's an obvious reason for that. Like Shrek 1&2, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo and other 3-D CGI animation films, it keeps its plot simple and easy to follow, when all the while manages to pay gestures to older films and themes us grown ups can relate to; thus really living up to the cliché that insists a G rating is for everyone from 4 to 90 9or something like that).As you can tell, I first and foremost fell in love with this film for sentimental reasons, but at the end of the day, what made me watch it again and again over time was its original mix of Sci-fi and traditional animation, unbelievable funny scenes (try watching Stitch running over the toy model of San Francisco and tell me you didn't laugh) and simple morals of family and friendship.

Back at the time, I was a 21 year old soldier, serving my third and last year of obligatory service in the Israeli army, counting the days left until I could be a civilian again. Anyway, I remember coming home one Friday after two weeks at the army, and I was all tired and worn out. Luckily enough, my ex-Girlfriend (we just started dating at the time) insisted we go out for dinner and a movie. I could still taste the gourmet meal I ate, and smell the popcorn that greeted me upon entering the theater. Needless to say, I wasn't the film buff I am now back then, and I entered Lilo & Stitch without any previous knowledge about what to expect.After all this time, I still don't know if it was the whole atmosphere of the brief vacation from the army or the fact it was an over the top animated masterpiece from the get go.

And if anyone was up for the task, it was visionary director Guy Ritchie, sweeping into theaters fresh off his cult classic Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to deliver his most hard hitting, savagely funny and effortlessly stylish film to date - Snatch. Director Ritchie has somewhat fallen out of favour with both critics and audiences of late with both his ill-advised cinematic tribute to his wife Madonna, Swept Away, and his nonsensical gambling drama Revolver, so it is easy to forget how masterful a filmmaker he can truly be when given the chance. Ritchie's convoluted tale, which ties together three parallel stories involving a diamond theft and the world of unlicensed bare knuckle boxing in the British underground may prove to be too full of twists and turns to be followed entirely on the first viewing. This, along with the stylistic similarities to its predecessor may prove to be the film's only major criticism; however, it is highly unlikely the majority of audiences will feel alienated by the fact that the adrenaline fuelled plot may prove hard to follow, and instead relish the chance to revisit the film multiple times to pick up on things they may have missed in previous viewings. In a film with as much to appreciate as this, it comes as no surprise that multiple viewings never seem to detract from the experience, but that the film seems only to increase in quality upon each viewing. Stylistically, the film is in a class of its own, employing hyper-kinetic cinematography and editing, which proves to be some of the most vivid and inventive work demonstrated in recent cinematic history. The film's score and musical selection is consistently pitch perfect, and endlessly catchy, never failing to amplify the seedy yet comical mood. Ritchie's sense of pacing is impeccable, and how a film which opens with a group of Jewish rabbis entering a bank, (which in itself sounds like the beginning to a particularly brilliant joke) only to steal its valuable contents, launching the film into an adrenaline fuelled title sequence could ever be considered not funny or at the very least oozing with style is beyond conventional logic. Ritchie also proves to have a real eye for location, and in each scene the viewer feels fully immersed in the grunge and filth of the underground, making the film that much more effective. The ensemble cast rise to the challenge of bringing Ritchie's brilliant screenplay to life, and turn out universally superb performances, each creating a unique and memorable character, complete with catchy names. Jason Statham is consistently strong as boxing promoter Turkish; his deadpan delivery and excellent narration carry the film wonderfully. Steven Graham similarly raises many a laugh as his consistently dumbfounded sidekick, Tommy. Benicio Del Toro makes wonderful use of his far too brief screen time as gambling addicted diamond thief Franky Four Fingers - his Las Vegas gambling flashbacks are nothing less than flat out hilarious. Ritchie favourite Vinnie Jones is savagely hilarious as mercenary Bullet Tooth Tony (a role it would seem is only a step away from his real life persona) and Russian actor Rade Serbedzija creates a simply classic character as arms dealer 'Boris the Blade'. Character actor Alan Ford makes for an exquisitely menacing antagonist as gambling shark 'Brick Top', and Robbie Gee and Lennie James are consistently hilarious as thoroughly unlucky attempted jewellery thieves. But surprisingly enough, the film's unlikely standout proves without a question to be its biggest star Brad Pitt, waltzing in to steal the show as incomprehensible 'Pikey' boxer Mickey - an egoless and thoroughly hilarious performance. Though this may be familiar ground for those who have seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Guy Ritchie's Snatch is no less enjoyable as a result - brutally violent, caustic and hilarious, with Ritchie's trademark sense of incomparable style. Snatch excels in every possible aspect, and the truly talented cast bring their vibrant characters to life with unquestionable flair, each one flat out hilarious when given their moment to shine.

Bob Wiley, (played by Bill Murray.) The chemistry between the two actors is wonderful!The story involves the good doctor Marvin getting ready to go on vacation.

He feels Dr. Marvin can help him! But UHHH OH!!! Dr. Marvin explains that he's going away on vacation for several weeks. To help him, he gives Bob his new self-help best-selling book, Baby Steps, detailing how to work out your problems in small, easily manageable stages. But that's not good enough for Bob! While he tries to use Baby Steps to overcome some phobias of getting on an elevator and a bus in public, he CAN'T be without his doctor, no matter what!Bob fakes his own suicide to get Dr. Marvin's answering service to give him his private number up at the lake.

Not only that, he begins to charm and love Dr. Marvin's own family who responds lovingly to Bob! Soon Bob is helping the family and they love him, and this is making poor Dr. Marvin.......INSANE! In one of the best scenes, Dr. Marvin's book Baby Steps is nationally accepted to be discussed by him on a TV talk show. The show wants to do a segment with Dr. Marvin at his lake home. But one hilarious problem is What About Bob? Will he go away and stay away for the interview?Yea right! Bob has now become a permanent patient in Dr. Marvin's life! I love this movie because of the great interactions between Richard Dreyfus and Bill Murray. Equally effective is Julie Hagarty, the zany stewardess from the Airplane movies as his wife.

Its targeted at the sorts of things that appeal to romance readers redemption, a hostile world, love, discovered honor. The book is a cartoon with faux travails from a lurid homeworld. If you were going to make a film of this without changing the book very much, and targeting the same audience as the book. You couldn't turn the story into something interesting, true or valuable. You couldn't make these characters matter. Lucky, because the director is incapable of doing so.What you could do is be lush. You'd create a home world that is lurid, with the earth sexually excited. You'd have full reds in a tumescent space (and rainy greys in contrast). You'd have novel ornamentation, excessive costumes. That's what we have here.

Artificial Intelligence.Ironically at first nobody didn't expect that The Sixth Sense was going to have half of this success. This means that, if it wasn't a success, then Haley Joel Osment wouldn't have had a single successful movie.Now let's talk about the movie itself. Sometimes this is classified as a terror movie, but for me this isn't really a terror film. This is a combination of supernatural, drama, tension, suspense, thriller and instrumental (but suspenseful) music, without the use of special effects. Its simplicity works out well. This motion picture is also emotional, funny at parts and only in brief moments there is some terror.Haley Joel Osment plays a difficult role for a child, but with his incredible talent he steals the show. He was the first child actor ever nominated for Best Actor. Too bad he didn't win (not only for this, but also for his other movies I mentioned).Bruce Willis is surprisingly good in this. He is usually a very limited actor, but in this he's just as good as Haley. Plus, unlike his other films, Bruce plays a likable character here.Aside some absolutely unnecessary scenes, this movie is generally good. One of the best parts is when Cole (Haley Joel Osment) finally reveals his secret to Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). That part is breathtaking, highly emotional and intense.

If you choose to ignore the previous facts attached to the JP universe, what this film offers you is a cheap, easy survival movie where the enemies are dinosaurs.In itself, the subject is interesting and cool, but the way they used it to form a plot was uninteresting and unoriginal a bunch of middle-class people being thrown in a dinosaur infested island looking for a kid.Now, if you have to compare it to the first 2 films of the franchise, it gets even worse. What first comes to my mind is the style of the movie and it's atmosphere in Jurassic Park and in its sequel, you had a change in mood that reflected to social situations explained in their respective films (JP1 was a movie about new technologies and showed the duality between great ambitions and critic regard of the consequences behind every action you decide to take, JP2 was about preserving what's left of the good side of your acts and interfering with those who did not yet achieve this state of consciousness) as opposed to this film, where stereotypes and rests of the first installments are brought up to screen without trying to satisfy the hunger for what made JP1 and 2 better films.In fact, they loosely followed the setting of these movies a rich man walk to Dr. Grant's digging site offering him a trip to a dinosaur island... and ends with Dr. Grant looking at birds (this time, it's those flying dinosaurs) trough an helicopter with a satisfied look on his face. But between those two parts, there's no food for thought, and if you defend it calling it a pure entertainment, let me call it a cheap one. As for the characters, they are merely shallow clones (!) of the ones they previously incarnated Grant is a bitter man who at some point in the film shows contempt on Ian Malcolm's preaching, yet the only 2 lines (with variations) of what he says throughout the movie are Don't do that and Ingen played god when they shouldn't have.Much of the magic that made JP1 a terrific film and JP2 an OK flick is gone as the only things I looked forward to by the first 20 minutes of the film was seeing as many humans being torn apart by dinosaurs as possible and in how many different ways. I was even disappointed by that, because Universal wanted the movie to be PG-13, so they could earn a few dollars more.And, as for a more formal analysis of the movie, the actors couldn't develop a good chemistry with each other, as they delivered their lines rather cheesily and perhaps undirected. The special effects were as good as usual, but less money in it, and more in efficient scriptwriters would have helped building a story without a book of Michael Crichton in the background. The dialogues were repetitive and unenjoyable, the realisation uninspired and the result, a LAME B-movie that should be categorized as a dinosaursploitation since I believe none other than a fan blinded by great expectations could enjoy it, and if it is not your case and you really want to take a look at it, download it prove with a small action that you won't pay for the crap (synonym censored here) they show you, no matter if the props man no.2 is starving on the streets or if Tea Leoni can't afford another plastic surgery\/mansion (if you can't look beyond that last statement and plainly consider it at first degree, do yourself a favor and ignore it instead of showing how much an intolerant dinosaur you are -> addressed to intellectual rights self-righteous rats).I would like to describe with greater words what I think of Joe Johnston, but it wouldn't be allowed by IMDb's terms of use.

The stage was set for a subtle political epic that would pave the way for such films as Gandhi and Chariots of Fire (which beat REDS for the title Best Picture). REDS took the critics by storm and garnered 3 Academy Awards in the process. Twenty-five years later, the film still carries a powerful message of the determination of love, and the dangers of fear.With the Cold War still raging full strength and America still nursing wounds from the Vietnam Era, Warren Beatty's epic historical drama of the rise of Communism in America may have been a gamble, but with a stellar cast and riding the wave of the success of Heaven Can Wait, the Academy Award winning director brought his dream to life. Beatty co-wrote, produced, directed and starred in the film that not only showcases his political beliefs that the American public unreasonably feared Communism, but also gave voice to his vision and talent as both actor and director. The film garnered more Academy Award nominations &#150; twelve &#150; than any other film in the previous 15 years.Based on actual events, the film tells the story of John Reed (Beatty), American Communist, activist and journalist, who falls for feminist\/writer Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton).

After an introduction at this year's 44th New York Film Festival, Beatty's Oscar gold shines through on REDS Silver Anniversary DVD.Reagan just took the White House, the hostages had just come home from Iran, the Berlin Wall still stood strong, and America had grown tired of the shallow and often gloomy films of the 1970's. The stage was set for a subtle political epic that would pave the way for such films as Gandhi and Chariots of Fire (which beat REDS for the title Best Picture). REDS took the critics by storm and garnered 3 Academy Awards in the process. Twenty-five years later, the film still carries a powerful message of the determination of love, and the dangers of fear.With the Cold War still raging full strength and America still nursing wounds from the Vietnam Era, Warren Beatty's epic historical drama of the rise of Communism in America may have been a gamble, but with a stellar cast and riding the wave of the success of Heaven Can Wait, the Academy Award winning director brought his dream to life. Beatty co-wrote, produced, directed and starred in the film that not only showcases his political beliefs that the American public unreasonably feared Communism, but also gave voice to his vision and talent as both actor and director. The film garnered more Academy Award nominations &#150; twelve &#150; than any other film in the previous 15 years.Based on actual events, the film tells the story of John Reed (Beatty), American Communist, activist and journalist, who falls for feminist\/writer Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton). Their love affair grows as the world around them unravels in the midst of World War I, the Russian Revolution and Congressional inquests into the American Communist Party. Bryant's love is put to the test when Reed is arrested trying to return to the United States from Russia and she embarks on a treacherous journey to be reunited with him. As the only American entombed in the Kremlin, Reeds impact on both the American Communist movement and the Russian Revolution itself are chronicled in the film. The film deftly utilizes personal interviews with those who actually knew Reed and Bryant, along with a steady pace of drama and romance to completely immerse its audience in the story. Beatty utilizes historic re-enactments and poignant deliveries from his stars &#150; including Maureen Stapleton, who won Best Supporting Actress gold for her role &#150; to create a bond with the characters and hope for their fates.

The first film, released in 1975, was a pioneering blockbuster directed by Steven Spielberg. He passed on a sequel, and so Jaws 2 was directed by Jeannot Swarc. Generally considered inferior to the first, it nonetheless made a modest profit at the box office in 1978. Five years would pass before another sequel was made&#151;but perhaps it shouldn't have. 1983 saw a brief revival of 3-D films at the box-office, with minimal results. It was likely presumed that a 3-D Jaws would have more 'bite' to offer filmgoers. It didn't work.This time (directed by Joe Alves), the action moves from the New England town of Amity to a coastal Florida Sea World amusement park. The film damages its thematic credibility early on by prematurely aging the Brody boys, sons of Chief Brody of the first two Jaws films. Now the 30-ish Mike (played by Dennis Quaid in his 80's zenith) is an engineer\/designer of underwater tunnel systems, with Sean college-aged and visiting his big brother for the summer. Bess Armstrong is Kathryn Morgan, the park's head marine biologist and Mike's love interest. Lea Thompson is Kelly, a ski-show performer and Sean's would-be girlfriend.Louis Gossett, Jr. (who had recently won an Oscar for his role in An Officer and a Gentleman) plays the flamboyant Calvin Bouchard, a New Orleans-reared businessman who has just recently taken over as the manager of the park. Fishy things start to happen when a great white shark apparently mauls an unsuspecting worker near the park's storm drainage tunnels.Enter Philip FitzRoyce, played by Simon MacCorkindale (TV's Manimal) an Australian wildlife photographer\/hunter who offers to capture the rogue predator. He is successful, and Bouchard orders that the shark be put on display to seize on the publicity. His decision is questioned by Kathryn and Mike, the latter of whom knows all too well that great whites aren't anything to trifle with.Soon, the shark specimen dies&#151;however, the recently discovered remains of another shark victim indicate that they couldn't have been killed by the shark in custody&#151;this one would have to be much bigger. Shortly afterwards, the park staff (and their clientele) are face to face with the shark's mother&#151;over 30 feet in length and apparently feeling a maternal revenge instinct. From there, shark mayhem starts happening in a major way, as the murderous predator mauls its way through a ski-show exhibition, the bumper boat lagoon, and floods an observation tunnel. The shark is contained only temporarily, setting up the climax where viewers get to see a slow-motion reaction shot from the protagonists as the shark apparently has the presence of mind to charge headlong into an underwater control room to get at those pesky humans.Quaid is decent enough as a lead and Gossett is always a pleasure to watch, but despite their acting pedigrees this film is still strictly B-grade at best. It is unintentionally humorous that Sea World would lend its brand name to be potentially marred as vulnerable to shark invasion (technically, there are no coastal-based Sea World parks). Perhaps the show dolphins prominently featured in the film (another real-life park attraction) had something to do with the enticement&#151;though it would have been great if at least one of them were sacrificed to the shark. The special effects here are dated, and rendered muter for the fact that the 3-D effect has been removed. Certain scenes show objects heading straight for the camera (like a hypodermic needle, a crossbow bolt, shattered glass&#151;oh yes, and 'Bruce'). Minus the 3-D effect, unknowing viewers may question the odd choice of angles. Everyone except a Jaws completist should only rent this film.
