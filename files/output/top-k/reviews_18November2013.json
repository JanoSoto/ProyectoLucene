But while watching it i realized that is not 'so bad' as his other works. Sure is cheap and cliché, and the characters wear a typical black and white dresses, the villain is very bad and the good is very good. The end just follows the predictable story arc. But even yet, despite all my dislike towards cliché films(although based on real life events), i kinda liked this one. The cinematography is good, the art direction is very good, the score by Ennio Morricone fits perfectly in the film... And Robert DeNiro performance is not that bad as some claim it to be. Sure it was way too cartoon-esque, but he really don't appears a lot in this film. He is mentioned a lot in the film,though. I think that his performance was exactly what this film needed in order to not fade away Al Capone of it.

After recently re-watching American Beauty, I can't believe how wrong I was back then. I guess it's more of an age thing, this is one of those films that would grow on you with every viewing, the more you watch it the more you will appreciate it, this is not a simple movie, it requires a lot of thinking and touches on a lot of subjects. Subjects like homosexuality, midlife crisis, homophobic, smoking pot, disciple, work out, physical attraction, real state businessman & more. All these subjects are also shown in a more positive light. But most of all this film shows us how beautiful the world really is.The plot follows different characters who are involved in all these social subjects. The movie is also very well acted as if the actors portraying the characters are the characters themselves. Kevin Spacey is absolutely brilliant as Lester, he perfectly portrays a man who is going though a midlife crisis, a boring life like he is a prisoner & getting bossed around by his wife & he could be described as sexually frustrated. After he sees Angela, Jane's friend his desires awaken, he becomes a changed man and does not take orders from his wife anymore and tries to become physically attractive. By the end of the film when he finds out Angela is a Virgin, he sees her as his own daughter. What a perfect transformation & change of character. Mena Suvari portrays a teenage girl who wants to be extraordinary and the center of attention very well, and she is also beautiful on Screen. Thora Birch as Jane was fine in portraying the teenage girl who wanted freedom and also was being sort of a weird or mysterious character. At first you may find Ricky creepy but later you will feel sympathy for him and realize why he or his mother is this way and why Ricky records! Because he simply wants to capture the beauty of the world. He also wants the freedom to do what he wants without his father's interference which connects him to Jane. Chris Cooper naturally portrays the retired colonel who tries to flex his authority over his family through aggressive behavior towards them, perhaps a homophobic or a man afraid of his own sexuality. Annette Benning as Carolyn is also fantastic she is quite possibly the best portrayal of a real state business woman in a movie, she cannot accept defeat, occupies superior position in her house, bosses her husband around and values materials more than enjoying life. Then her life takes a turn after Lester stops taking orders from her and she becomes very frustrated and she was also decisively losing to a competitor named Buddy, after this she started an illegitimate relationship with buddy, & she started enjoying life again till her husband discovered her affair and she broke up with Buddy and felt broken again. It was not until her Husband's death she realized that she actually loved him. Again great transformation and character development. The minor characters also put on a commendable performance.All characters in this film are fantastic and well acted and the plot flows though really well because of it. The soundtrack is also fantastic and suits the feel of the movie. Some really memorable and funny scenes too, which you will feel like watching over and over again and enjoy. This film does try to tell its story but it doesn't remain serious it also tries to be funny. Thus it is a perfect blend of comedy, drama and social commentary. My only gripe with this movie would be its pacing because even the film just slightly over 2 hours long, the film feels like its longer , it moves at a very slow & methodical pace to deliver its message. The viewer would also be left deeply interpreting what he saw. This affects the film's replay value. Additionally the actors who played Jane and Ricky remained expression throughout most of the film, maybe it is a part of their characters but it really makes their performance not stand out compared to the rest of the cast, plus their scenes dragged on, apart from the scene with the flying Bag & the scene in which where Ricky tells her his real story. Lester's fantasies about Angela were also overdone in my opinion. But those are just minor issues of an otherwise absolutely brilliant film which is as close as a film can get to a work of art, this film absolutely worthy of the Oscar it received.

With help from the enigmatic time-travel guide Rufus (George Carlin) and a magic phone booth, Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) go back in time to learn firsthand about, and kidnap, historical figures as a way to pass their high school history course in 1988.The historical figures are all stereotypical of their contemporary public image, and include among others Genghis Khan, Billy the Kid, Lincoln, Napoleon, and a couple of dudes who Bill and Ted refer to as Sigmund Frood and that well-known Greek philosopher So-craits.Indeed, part of the fun is the inane jabber between dim-bulbs Bill and Ted. But the dudes are charming and energetic and mean no harm. Of the two, Ted, whom I refer to as mop head, is probably the funnier. At one point he addresses Billy the Kid as Mr. The Kid. And when So-craits says the only true wisdom consists in knowing that you know nothing, mop head responds cheerfully That's us, dude. Marvelous.The film's first half contains some good humor; the second half becomes ever sillier, from the shopping mall sequence on to the end. The sequence in the auditorium where students give their reports is not the least bit funny, and is loaded with juvenile clichés. None of the script's dialogue contains any subtext. But that's to be expected when we have such bodacious characters that only want to party on. The plot centers on physical action, not cerebral mind games.There's a lot of CGI in this film, and it is done rather well; the special effects do not get in the way of the story. Casting is acceptable. But it's the photogenic Keanu Reeves who really makes the story interesting. Acting is about what we would expect for a popcorn flick.However shallow the characters may be, and however silly some of the plot elements are, there are some deep messages here. The film offers a satire on suburban youth culture in the frivolous 80s. It also speaks to how different our contemporary culture is from bygone eras, thus offering historical perspective. And of course, Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure, despite the comedy or perhaps through it, veritably oozes contempt for the failure of American education.

With help from the enigmatic time-travel guide Rufus (George Carlin) and a magic phone booth, Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) go back in time to learn firsthand about, and kidnap, historical figures as a way to pass their high school history course in 1988.The historical figures are all stereotypical of their contemporary public image, and include among others Genghis Khan, Billy the Kid, Lincoln, Napoleon, and a couple of dudes who Bill and Ted refer to as Sigmund Frood and that well-known Greek philosopher So-craits.Indeed, part of the fun is the inane jabber between dim-bulbs Bill and Ted. But the dudes are charming and energetic and mean no harm. Of the two, Ted, whom I refer to as mop head, is probably the funnier. At one point he addresses Billy the Kid as Mr. The Kid. And when So-craits says the only true wisdom consists in knowing that you know nothing, mop head responds cheerfully That's us, dude. Marvelous.The film's first half contains some good humor; the second half becomes ever sillier, from the shopping mall sequence on to the end. The sequence in the auditorium where students give their reports is not the least bit funny, and is loaded with juvenile clichés. None of the script's dialogue contains any subtext. But that's to be expected when we have such bodacious characters that only want to party on. The plot centers on physical action, not cerebral mind games.There's a lot of CGI in this film, and it is done rather well; the special effects do not get in the way of the story. Casting is acceptable. But it's the photogenic Keanu Reeves who really makes the story interesting. Acting is about what we would expect for a popcorn flick.However shallow the characters may be, and however silly some of the plot elements are, there are some deep messages here. The film offers a satire on suburban youth culture in the frivolous 80s. It also speaks to how different our contemporary culture is from bygone eras, thus offering historical perspective. And of course, Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure, despite the comedy or perhaps through it, veritably oozes contempt for the failure of American education. The film's thematic depth thus renders it a serious study of suburban youth culture in the latter decades of the twentieth century.

I thought back then that this was a rip-off of other buddy-cop films like Running Scared and Lethal Weapon. After seeing it again years later, nothing has changed. It's still just another formulaic buddy-cop rip-off of the Lethal Weapon series and has all the right ingredients for the cheese factory workers to work double overtime here. We have the corny, awkwardly disjointed one-liners. We're treated to an exhibition of noisy, inept badly choreographed action and lots of oily, sweaty muscles that reek of perspiration. Lots of bad jokes about certain parts of one's manhood. And most of all, a story that has no direction going for it. I'm sure there was a story arc around the surface somewhere, but the details are rather iffy for me to fully explain, but then again this movie did not really depend on a solid storyline. What stands out plot-wise is Ray Tango (Sylvester Stallone) and Gabriel Cash (Kurt Russell) were sentenced to jail for a crime they didn't commit, so they try to escape in order to claim their innocence. Sadly, there's no real motive behind the drug-lord Yves Perret's (Jack Palance)road to madness, however the movie takes a turn for the worst when it becomes indecisive as to whether it wants to feel like a crappy video game or a formulaic Saturday action cartoon show (some were good, others were the pits). It's up to Tango and Cash to stop this villain Perret from going into his fortress, with the help of their vehicle, the Tango and Cash Mobile. The Mobile is an armoured truck with guns attached to it and rapid boosters useful for taking down Perret's gang of goons (with no explanation why he has them in the first place) but they too have similar vehicles too as well. Yes this where the climax of the film takes place. The performers behind this jilted buddy-cop duo are Sylvester Stallone as the Roger Murtaugh-like immaculate cop only he loves to play dirty. While Kurt Russell plays the Martin Riggs character who also neglects the book and takes his job over the edge. In other words, they're both mirror images of themselves, but wearing opposing clothing. Once again, Stallone's performance is no different than his other roles he's done before and after offering the same dead fish delivery that refrains from expressing any kind of emotion. His job is to deliver brainless one-liners and blow up things. Call me biased, but I truly enjoy Kurt Russell (I mean he's Captain Ron for Christ's sake), but I can't help but feel bad for him every time when he and had to complete Stallone's unfinished jokes or telling jokes about their man jewels. One minute Russell is Snake Plissken a ruthless SOB and now he has to shower with John Rambo. Yes there's a shower scene with these two in it, so homophobes beware. So even though I ranted a lot about this movie, but the flaws that I referred to and many more are actually what makes this movie very entertaining. I find there's nothing wrong with laughing with stupidity as long as you don't laugh at stupidity all the time; unless you are a retard. But it does open a debate with your friends if the director of Tango and Cash deliberately made a stupid movie.

He's invited by the American government to go back to Vietnam to investigate\/talk about the phenomenon of soldiers still Missing In Action. Tensions flare, thanks to the evil General Trau (Hong). Braddock, being the badass that he is, decides to go off on his own into the jungle (actually with Tuck (Walsh), an old army buddy), and rescue any remaining POW's himself. While in the midst of their mission, they face an endless stream of baddies trying to stop them. It'll take all the firepower and skill Braddock has to defeat the enemy and save the missing men. Can he do it? This is classic Cannon all the way, and they really hit paydirt with this one. Thanks to the high-quality cinematography, the rousing, triumphant score, and the longer running time, Missing In Action has that big-screen feel. While the pace, at least for the first half of the movie, may seem a bit on the slow side to modern viewers, that's just the way things worked back then. It's a pre-ADD generation action movie. And we're all the better for it. It's ultimately a rewarding experience, and Cannon (as well as moviegoers) obviously thought so too, as this spawned two sequels to date (maybe we haven't seen the last of Braddock...?). Surely this film was at the forefront of the exploding hut\/guy falling out of a guard tower\/mindless shooting jungle movie back in the golden age of the 80's. Along with the Rambo series, not to mention countless Direct-To-Video items, these movies capitalized on the craze for patriotic movies with plenty of violence that were so in vogue in the Reagan 80's. To hammer the point home even more, stock footage of Reagan is actually IN Missing In Action 2. If you even THINK about communism, Braddock, Rambo, or any number of other heroes will mow you down with a machine gun that's taller than they are. So there. Take that you stupid commies.As for the cast and crew, Chuck Norris here started to take tentative steps toward his Texas-based clothing style that would manifest itself most fully during the Walker Texas Ranger years. His hair and beard are at their reddest and most impressive here, and when he wears his sunglasses, you really can't even see his face. M. Emmet Walsh is always a welcome sight to see, and he plays a similar character in Red Scorpion (1988), which was also directed by Joseph Zito. As good as Walsh is, we also felt the role could have been played by Nick Nolte. Lenore Kasdorf of L.A. Bounty (1989) fame is onboard, as well as James Hong, who's been in pretty much everything. For our purposes here, he was in the same year's Cannon vehicle, the great Ninja III (1984), and much later was in Talons Of the Eagle (1992). Willie Williams, whose entire movie career seems to have been in Vietnam (or Nam-like) Jungle movies such as Final Mission (1984), Savage Justice (1988), Saigon Commandos (1988) and, not coincidentally, P.O.W. The Escape (1986), continues his tradition with the movie at hand today.Also it has been said that none other than Van Damme appears in an uncredited role as Car Driver, but we didn't see him, so we can't necessarily confirm that that's actually true. But he's also credited with stunts, along with Aaron Norris, who would go on to direct the second sequel, Braddock, as well as Dean Ferrandini, who would go on to direct Overkill (1996). The next year after this, Zito would direct the ultimate Chuck movie, Invasion U.S.A. (1985) This is a nice trial run for that masterpiece.If there was going to be a movie version of the 80's Nintendo game Jackal, this could be it. It's a shoot-em-up where the hero must save the hostages. But here the hero is outspoken on the M.I.A. issue and is Chuck Norris. I guess those are the only two differences.Missing In Action is undoubtedly a classic and is completely worth seeing. In our eyes, however, the series would improve even more in the subsequent two outings, so watch out for those as well.

While in the midst of their mission, they face an endless stream of baddies trying to stop them. It'll take all the firepower and skill Braddock has to defeat the enemy and save the missing men. Can he do it? This is classic Cannon all the way, and they really hit paydirt with this one. Thanks to the high-quality cinematography, the rousing, triumphant score, and the longer running time, Missing In Action has that big-screen feel. While the pace, at least for the first half of the movie, may seem a bit on the slow side to modern viewers, that's just the way things worked back then. It's a pre-ADD generation action movie. And we're all the better for it. It's ultimately a rewarding experience, and Cannon (as well as moviegoers) obviously thought so too, as this spawned two sequels to date (maybe we haven't seen the last of Braddock...?). Surely this film was at the forefront of the exploding hut\/guy falling out of a guard tower\/mindless shooting jungle movie back in the golden age of the 80's. Along with the Rambo series, not to mention countless Direct-To-Video items, these movies capitalized on the craze for patriotic movies with plenty of violence that were so in vogue in the Reagan 80's. To hammer the point home even more, stock footage of Reagan is actually IN Missing In Action 2. If you even THINK about communism, Braddock, Rambo, or any number of other heroes will mow you down with a machine gun that's taller than they are. So there. Take that you stupid commies.As for the cast and crew, Chuck Norris here started to take tentative steps toward his Texas-based clothing style that would manifest itself most fully during the Walker Texas Ranger years. His hair and beard are at their reddest and most impressive here, and when he wears his sunglasses, you really can't even see his face. M. Emmet Walsh is always a welcome sight to see, and he plays a similar character in Red Scorpion (1988), which was also directed by Joseph Zito. As good as Walsh is, we also felt the role could have been played by Nick Nolte. Lenore Kasdorf of L.A. Bounty (1989) fame is onboard, as well as James Hong, who's been in pretty much everything. For our purposes here, he was in the same year's Cannon vehicle, the great Ninja III (1984), and much later was in Talons Of the Eagle (1992). Willie Williams, whose entire movie career seems to have been in Vietnam (or Nam-like) Jungle movies such as Final Mission (1984), Savage Justice (1988), Saigon Commandos (1988) and, not coincidentally, P.O.W. The Escape (1986), continues his tradition with the movie at hand today.Also it has been said that none other than Van Damme appears in an uncredited role as Car Driver, but we didn't see him, so we can't necessarily confirm that that's actually true. But he's also credited with stunts, along with Aaron Norris, who would go on to direct the second sequel, Braddock, as well as Dean Ferrandini, who would go on to direct Overkill (1996). The next year after this, Zito would direct the ultimate Chuck movie, Invasion U.S.A. (1985) This is a nice trial run for that masterpiece.If there was going to be a movie version of the 80's Nintendo game Jackal, this could be it. It's a shoot-em-up where the hero must save the hostages. But here the hero is outspoken on the M.I.A. issue and is Chuck Norris. I guess those are the only two differences.Missing In Action is undoubtedly a classic and is completely worth seeing.

Hollywood has rarely achieved more compelling - and likable - human drama. This is a glossy and romanticized slice of Americana, yet it tells a powerfully real story. It's got great screen stars - most notably Fredric March - doing some of the best work of their careers. And it has absolutely impeccable direction by William Wyler - so polished that you have to work hard to pull back and actually notice the sophisticated techniques at work.The film's only limitation is one it can't avoid it's of its time and place. This is a 1946 Hollywood film about the aftermath of global conflict that had only just ended. It's a work that tackles a deeply political topic, from within the period it tries to capture. This inherent difficulty comes through in one subtle way and in one overt scene.The subtle slant comes from what we don't see. For example, we aren't shown the many soldiers who were far worse off than our three protagonists. Homer Parrish does mention that his own shocking disability is actually one of the milder ones he's seen. The film passes this off as casual heroism on his part, when it's in fact all the lip service that's given those who paid a much higher price than this film's relatively lucky trio. All three of whom swiftly find supremely happy endings - surely, not a statistically realistic outcome. This can be thought of as subliminal propaganda, no doubt, but it's mostly just artistic license - a way of sugar-coating some hard truths for the benefit of a war-weary public.The one overt bit of actual propaganda comes in the scene in which Homer gets in a fight with a guy at the lunch counter, who dares to question the political rationale behind the war. If you listen carefully, this man actually says nothing derogatory regarding the troops. Although his manner is made deliberately obnoxious, what he says repeatedly is simply get the facts, learn for yourself. An admonition that should never be controversial, in a free society. Yet when Homer snatches away the man's flag lapel pin, the message seems to be that some topics are simply too important to be examined rationally, because, well... patriotism. Once you've spent enough lives, it's no longer acceptable to question whether the tactics were wise or the cause just.We can only hope that this point of view may look a lot more dangerous now, than it must have in 1946. But, to its credit, the film can also be read another way. It does at least hint that the two servicemen are in fact over-reacting. That they probably should question the official narrative, but that their memories are still too painful. Is the scene helping create an attitude of denial... or consciously reflecting upon one that inevitably did exist? I suspect the subtlety is deliberate. Which is the most we could hope for in a mainstream film originating in this time and place.Obviously, any film must be viewed in the context of history. The Best Years of Our Lives must have been a revelation in 1946. A landmark, in going as far as it did in recognizing that the human cost of a war extends far beyond the conflict itself, even for the 'victors.' But today it remains above all a brilliant bit of human drama, a supremely skillful telling of three intertwining stories about characters that are at once noble, likable and credible. It's a film that takes real effort to analyze, simply because it's so overwhelmingly enjoyable.

It is so good that the fact that it is made in black and white is completely forgotten. Billy Wilder directed the movie, and the cast included such stars as Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis. Also this movie won an Academy Award for the Best Costume Design, Black and White, the reason why it says black and white is because at the time movies could already be made with color, so the award were divided between color, and black and white.The movie is set in 1927, and it is about two musicians who find themselves unemployed, and go searching for a job. Both found a job on girls band and this made it impossible for them to take it, so they got another job, and while getting into the car both men Joe (Tony Curtis), and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) were witnesses of a murder committed by the Chicago mafia. Being witness of this incident both Joe, and Jerry must leave and hide from the mafia, which is looking for them because of what they had witnessed before. Joe and Jerry decide to take the job of the girl's band and disguise themselves as girls, so that they could enter the band without any problems. From the point where both men enter the train with the rest of the girls the rest of the movie is an extremely comic journey.The movie's main Characters were Joe, or Josephine, Jerry, or Daphne, and Sugar Kane. Joe and Josephine were both made by Tony Curtis and he fitted perfectly for both characters due to his personality, he was a very comic part of the movie and made an exceptional job. Jerry and Daphne were both acted by Jack Lemmon and he was also brilliant in the movie and fitted his role perfectly and in my opinion was more comic than Tony Curtis in the movie. Both Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon were vital in the creation of this movie; definitely the movie wouldn't have been the same without these two magnificent actors. Then, there was Sugar Kane which was interpreted by Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe, she was the perfect women for the role due to the fact that Sugar Kane was a very beautiful woman, the character of Sugar Kane represented in a way a very materialist and woman and with alcoholic problems.In my opinion on of the best scenes of the movie is when Joe is dressed as a wealthy man and is with Sugar Kane at the yacht while Daphne is dancing with a rich man names Osgood who is in love with her, and doesn't really know she is really a he. A scene, which I didn't like, was at the beginning when Joe and Jerry are looking for jobs, I found that part of the movie kind of slow and bored me for a little moment.Some Like It Hot was a risky movie due to the fact that men were transforming themselves into women, and at the time to watch this was not very common. Curtis Hanson, a director, said It's a film about sex from the title to the final line. It's not just about sex as in people having sex; it's also about sexual roles, and of course sexual identity. The fact that both men dressed as women and all those problems came in was pretty funny and this movie was not only a romantic comedy because of the love between Joe and Sugar Kane, but it is also a screwball, and gangster movie. Screwball because of everything that happens throughout the movie, and gangster because of all the mafia issued shown in the film.I believe that this movie would be good for any kind of audience because it is a great comedy and it will make anyone laugh and have a great time.

Jerry and Daphne were both acted by Jack Lemmon and he was also brilliant in the movie and fitted his role perfectly and in my opinion was more comic than Tony Curtis in the movie. Both Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon were vital in the creation of this movie; definitely the movie wouldn't have been the same without these two magnificent actors. Then, there was Sugar Kane which was interpreted by Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe, she was the perfect women for the role due to the fact that Sugar Kane was a very beautiful woman, the character of Sugar Kane represented in a way a very materialist and woman and with alcoholic problems.In my opinion on of the best scenes of the movie is when Joe is dressed as a wealthy man and is with Sugar Kane at the yacht while Daphne is dancing with a rich man names Osgood who is in love with her, and doesn't really know she is really a he. A scene, which I didn't like, was at the beginning when Joe and Jerry are looking for jobs, I found that part of the movie kind of slow and bored me for a little moment.Some Like It Hot was a risky movie due to the fact that men were transforming themselves into women, and at the time to watch this was not very common. Curtis Hanson, a director, said It's a film about sex from the title to the final line. It's not just about sex as in people having sex; it's also about sexual roles, and of course sexual identity. The fact that both men dressed as women and all those problems came in was pretty funny and this movie was not only a romantic comedy because of the love between Joe and Sugar Kane, but it is also a screwball, and gangster movie. Screwball because of everything that happens throughout the movie, and gangster because of all the mafia issued shown in the film.I believe that this movie would be good for any kind of audience because it is a great comedy and it will make anyone laugh and have a great time. I really enjoyed this movie and wouldn't doubt of watching it once more. I would give this movie a 4.7\/5This review was written by a sophomore who enjoys watching movies and loves anything related to comedy. This move review was written for an film appreciation class.

This is a movie which, to its great benefit, is more about the story than shocking, scary moments. To be sure there are some good frights sprinkled throughout. But nothing over-the-top. This movie is more interested in making you think than in frightening you. What exactly is going on in this house? It's a mystery the audience will be trying to solve right along with the characters. Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, mother of two young children. The three of them live alone in an isolated house on the island of Jersey in the days immediately following the end of World War II. Grace's husband is presumed dead in the war. The family's servants just up and left in the middle of the night. Three new servants arrive at the house. And here things begin to get very interesting.From the moment we meet them there is something slightly off about these new servants. An aging nanny, an elderly gardener and a mute young woman...they're quite the odd trio. But they know the house, having worked there before and Grace welcomes them in. But first Grace must explain the rules for the house, rules designed to keep all sunlight out as the children are so sensitive to the light it would kill them. This makes for a dark atmosphere which adds so much to the film, especially once things start to go bump in the night. Grace's daughter Anne sees the ghosts but Grace herself refuses to believe it. The servants, especially the nanny Mrs. Mills, seem to know more than they are letting on. It's pretty clear these servants hold the movie's secrets. What are those secrets? The fun for us is in finding out. Grace needs to find the answers too but it seems unlikely she'll find much fun in it.Kidman is excellent in playing the loving, protective mother who is thoroughly harried by the unseen intruders in her home. Fionnula Flanagan is also terrific playing the mysterious Mrs. Mills who is somehow creepy even when she's not trying to be. Or maybe she is trying. Also notable are the performances of the young actors playing the children. James Bentley is quite good in playing the boy, Nicholas, but it is Alakina Mann, playing Anne, who is the true revelation. Mann turns in one of the best child acting performances you'll ever see, mature far beyond her years in playing a girl who sees ghosts and is not even freaked out by them, taking it all in her stride. Kudos to director Alejandro Amenábar for coaxing such fine performances from his cast and for creating such a creepy atmosphere. The movie's story is a smart one, building slowly but surely toward its big climax. There are enough hints sprinkled throughout that may let you figure things out before the characters do. So maybe when the ending comes it doesn't pack quite as much of a wallop as it would if you were totally stunned by it. But it is still all in all a very satisfying movie-watching experience. A good story with enough subtle little scares thrown in to keep happy those who are looking for chills and thrills.

This comedy made controversy out of its use of not very common themes in the cinema theaters. The use of themes like homosexuality, mafia and gangster difficulties, and alcoholism were all themes that were not common at all during the ages of the 1950s. The use of stereotypes as blondes symbolized as dumb and unconsciously acting women, gangsters as selfish and crude men, and musicians as poor and needy people make the movies way of description easier since just by getting to know the characters you know what they are and what they want. It all starts at an old 1950s Chicago, when Jerry and Joe, two musicians escape from the closure of an illegal pub. They run away with no where to go and look for jobs since they are almost money- less. The most valuable things they have are their instruments. They find out about a band who is leaving in tour and needs two musicians, but the problem is that the band is composed by all female musicians, so they reject the job. After looking for other jobs Joe and Jerry happen to become witnesses of a mafia murder so they run away again but this time away from the mafia. For them to get away from the area they finally take the female band tour and leave with the other female musicians as if they were women. Everything happens to go well as they pretend to be female musicians but someone intervenes in their plans, and that someone is Sugar, interpreted by Marylyn Monroe. She happens to be a really beautiful but dumb girl who is part if the band. They both fall in love with her. They finally reach their destination, Miami, Florida. They get there and another character appears, he is Osgood. He falls in love of the female version of Jerry, Daphne. The story goes on and Joe tries to make Sugar fall in love with a fake millionaire version of him, and it sorts to work out. Joe got the idea that Jerry should take Osgood, the money-abundant old man, dressed as Daphne out for a dinner to a Latin bar at the coast, while Joe dressed as the fake millionaire version of him takes Sugar with him into Osgood's yacht at the beach. The morning after it happened that Daphne and Osgood got engaged, Osgood without knowing that Daphne is in reality Jerry. Sugar is sad because her new loved man has gone.

Gangster and Mafia problematics when they witness and are followed by the mafia in both cities, Chicago and Miami. The story made controversy when it was revealed to the audience since they weren't used to themes of that big impact in society. In my opinion the movie has to fix some details as the cast acting skills and the short and brief ending. Everything else in the movie is mostly good.

This flick is more of an action flick really, its set after the Nam war and not within the actual war. I did kinda expect a Nam war flick given the films poster but its not really, whether or not its actually based on any truths again I'm not really sure. I guess its possible, I think there were many US soldiers held after the war had finished and there certainly were many soldiers MIA. Whether anyone actually tried this idea without proper official backing I don't know, possible though.Lets not beat around the camouflaged bush here though, this premise is ripe for a ripping action flick, a real Rambo style emotional roller-coaster. I will give the film its due it does exactly that, you get exactly what you'd expect, it doesn't try to sugarcoat anything or be overally flashy, its clichéd and corny at the best of times but its a real crowd pleaser if you ask me.Gene Hackman's son is MIA in a remote area of Laos ten years after the Nam war, he believes he's still alive and wants to rescue him but the government aren't interested. So off he goes to find a team of Nam vets to dive into Laos, rescue any POW's and bounce back across the border before anyone knew they were there...oh and kill a whole load of natives.Cue your obligatory recruitment sequences as Hackman snoops out soldiers from his sons platoon and other war torn troopers. Then cue your obligatory training sequences as the men are brought back up to scratch. Then cue your standard drop into Laos and preparation for taking out the POW camp. Its all very easy and by the numbers plus you have seen this kind of thing many times before. One could almost say its an 'A-Team' version of 'Predator' when Arnie and his boys take out the hostile camp at the start. You know what I mean by that...there's plenty of friendly fire, action is violent but you don't see anything, lots of cuts, little specks of blood and lots of extras leaping through the air.What makes this film so damn fun is the cast, oh boy what a cast! its a classic character actor line up. Under Hackman we have Tim Thomerson playing another Nam vet chopper pilot (before 'Air America'), Fred Ward in his year of recognition with two other major film releases, Harold Sylvester as the typical 80's token black character, Captain America himself Reb Brown, Randall 'Tex' Cobb surprisingly trying to act being a good guy and a very young Pat Swayze. Naturally each man has his own skills for individual moments in the action...Cobb would be the wild strongman type in case you might not have guessed it.But lets put the action man gung-ho action aside for a mo, its not an all out ham fest by any means. There is a lot of actual emotion and heart in this film, its based on reality, real events and probably struck a cord with many real vets. The action is a bit hokey and tame by today's standards sure, not overally realistic or well coordinated at times but it tries to be gritty and accurate. I do wonder how they didn't all manage to get killed really, they were hardly an example of special ops but hey never mind. The ending is weepy, its gets you, but the most important thing is you care about the characters, the film gets that right, you want them all to make it back.The whole thing feels very much like a TV movie really, it has moments of good production values with some nice explosions in the finale but overall it felt a bit restricted. The musical score seemed very cheap to me, as though it was a selection that you can rent and has been used in many action films. Hell Hackman's character looks like he's out for a good hike in the Alps when we see him in the jungle for the showdown. Still I can't deny I really enjoyed this film, I got hella pumped for the finale POW bust out, that got me going. I really wanted to see the guys succeed, really liked that team and the film is so heartfelt and sweet.

Whether anyone actually tried this idea without proper official backing I don't know, possible though.Lets not beat around the camouflaged bush here though, this premise is ripe for a ripping action flick, a real Rambo style emotional roller-coaster. I will give the film its due it does exactly that, you get exactly what you'd expect, it doesn't try to sugarcoat anything or be overally flashy, its clichéd and corny at the best of times but its a real crowd pleaser if you ask me.Gene Hackman's son is MIA in a remote area of Laos ten years after the Nam war, he believes he's still alive and wants to rescue him but the government aren't interested. So off he goes to find a team of Nam vets to dive into Laos, rescue any POW's and bounce back across the border before anyone knew they were there...oh and kill a whole load of natives.Cue your obligatory recruitment sequences as Hackman snoops out soldiers from his sons platoon and other war torn troopers. Then cue your obligatory training sequences as the men are brought back up to scratch. Then cue your standard drop into Laos and preparation for taking out the POW camp. Its all very easy and by the numbers plus you have seen this kind of thing many times before. One could almost say its an 'A-Team' version of 'Predator' when Arnie and his boys take out the hostile camp at the start. You know what I mean by that...there's plenty of friendly fire, action is violent but you don't see anything, lots of cuts, little specks of blood and lots of extras leaping through the air.What makes this film so damn fun is the cast, oh boy what a cast! its a classic character actor line up. Under Hackman we have Tim Thomerson playing another Nam vet chopper pilot (before 'Air America'), Fred Ward in his year of recognition with two other major film releases, Harold Sylvester as the typical 80's token black character, Captain America himself Reb Brown, Randall 'Tex' Cobb surprisingly trying to act being a good guy and a very young Pat Swayze. Naturally each man has his own skills for individual moments in the action...Cobb would be the wild strongman type in case you might not have guessed it.But lets put the action man gung-ho action aside for a mo, its not an all out ham fest by any means. There is a lot of actual emotion and heart in this film, its based on reality, real events and probably struck a cord with many real vets. The action is a bit hokey and tame by today's standards sure, not overally realistic or well coordinated at times but it tries to be gritty and accurate. I do wonder how they didn't all manage to get killed really, they were hardly an example of special ops but hey never mind. The ending is weepy, its gets you, but the most important thing is you care about the characters, the film gets that right, you want them all to make it back.The whole thing feels very much like a TV movie really, it has moments of good production values with some nice explosions in the finale but overall it felt a bit restricted. The musical score seemed very cheap to me, as though it was a selection that you can rent and has been used in many action films. Hell Hackman's character looks like he's out for a good hike in the Alps when we see him in the jungle for the showdown. Still I can't deny I really enjoyed this film, I got hella pumped for the finale POW bust out, that got me going. I really wanted to see the guys succeed, really liked that team and the film is so heartfelt and sweet. Yeah i know that sounds pathetically lame but its true! such a pleasant Nam war flick.7\/10 ","genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"18 November 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" A straight basic plot that doesn't mess around with complications.
