There is genius locked within, but there are major snags; it has a really weak opening in Switzerland, with some of the worst 'romantic' dialogue I have ever heard outside of Twilight (and for a film that billed itself so much on groundbreaking visuals, they sure must've hired a cheap editor for that part as it often felt like Williams and Sciorra weren't even in the same scene together as they met on the boats).

The whole concept of the afterlife being more modelled after you and the way you died rather than some strict tier\/sections is really intriguing, and we get plenty of contrasts, often in an almost pseudo Biblical-Buddhist manner, such as Hell being caused by denial and guilt rather than 'evil'. Also, aside from two strong albeit un-connecting performances, the rest of the cast is pretty solid, with Max Von Sydow and Cuba Gooding Jr really adding quite a bit to the emotional heart of the film, and Sydow's voice just makes the rules of the afterlife seem so much more grand and weighty. Oh, and Michael Kamen's score is just beautiful. Utterly.In the end, I applaud Vincent Ward for trying, I really do. He threw out his hand at such an expansive piece as this and injected flair. However, a few fundamental errors ended up costing the film a lot more than I would've liked, and though it's still leaps and bounds better than Williams' other meta-life epic 'Being Human', it still doesn't quite soar.

It's as though every cinematographer and director from that period had been so continually high on cocaine and crack that they decided that ugliness was the new prettiness. Take a look at almost any movie from that period and then tell me it isn't far uglier than the visual standards from before it or after it.BM looks so good that a true visual fetishist such as I can enjoy the movie despite its mostly appalling and embarrassing attempts at humour. Gilliam comes from the Italian-French school of comedy in which a banana peel lying in wait for a foot still represents the height of genius and innovation. In other words, the Comedic School of Cheesy Buffoonery. Idle, the poor sap, got most of the worst lines; he must have suffered greatly having to learn and then deliver such trifles in front of a 100+ strong crew, not to mention the millions who watched him do it later on the screen. I very much doubt that spontaneous on-set laughter was a problem for Gilliam during the film's shooting; perhaps embarrassing silence might have been more accurate.Still, there are a few very funny moments &#x96; a handful only, admittedly &#x96; that spring out of nowhere, and by nowhere I mean the dry laugh-less desert that Gilliam's weak dialogue provides, which is why every good gag comes almost as a shock. For example, Pryce's suggestion to the Turkish sultan that they should surrender because we surrendered the last time, so it's your turn. Also, Pryce's comment that France is out of virgins &#x96; after the sultan asks for some.Which brings me to the mystery of who Gilliam intended this movie for kids or adults? On the one hand there are just so many dumb and vapid visual gags and pathetic one-liners that only truly un-gifted kids can enjoy; on the other hand we have Robin Williams talking about orgasms and Pryce mentioning virgins. Perhaps the humour was intended for dumb adults?All of Gilliam's comedies (except Time Bandits) have a serious humour problem, because of his penchant for corny sight gags and incredibly childish quips. But the performances suffer too; Oliver Reed was never cut out for comedy, yet what chance did he have while under the guidance of Gilliam's clumsy direction (I'm talking about directing actors, not creating amazing action sequences and the like, in which Gilliam excels sometimes).The movie is up-and-down. The theater sequences look amazing but are dull content-wise. The Moon segment is fun, the volcano segment dull, and so on.TAOBM is from the part of Gilliam's career when he was still trying to come to terms with basic film-making concepts such as staying on budget and curbing the zealous perfectionism in order to appease the producers and financiers. This was a good thing for the viewer, because this time-consuming and money-wasting approach results in visually striking movies, but bad for Gilliam who easily could have had his career cut short with behind-the-scenes disasters that followed Brazil and TAOBM every step of the way, during and after shooting. Not that it would have mattered had his career been over after this film; it was all downhill from here. Fisher King is an overly sentimental overrated oddity, 12 Monkeys is visually modest and has logic holes as big as Robert Redford's empty pumpkin-head, Fear & Loathing is an abominable embarrassment and one of the dullest movies ever made, The Brothers Grimm has Matt Damon in it hence ruined, and Tideland is even more boring than Depp and del Toro horsing around in Vegas, not to mention utterly stupid. Only Imaginarium succeeded in repeating some of that visual quality he became renowned for, plus a half-decent story.I'd always wondered how such an average actress (and average-looking one as well) as Sarah Polley made it in movies. Now I know why; Gilliam hired HER (of all the thousands of possible girls) for this role. Did he think those teeth are funny? I wasn't laughing &#x96; and was laughing even less (i.e. laughing less than not laughing at all, which I know might not make sense) when watching Sarah with her even worse adult teeth in later movies. I don't like fake, glittering, white-as-a-wall Hollywood dentures, but couldn't she have gone to the dentist once?I do have to also wonder about that very strange line that the Baron throws at Sarah &#x85; otherwise I will knock you up! Knock her up? Is this a clandestine message of pro-pedophilic support that Gilliam is sending to all the child-molesting perverts out there? Sarah is only 8 or 9 in this movie, and I am convinced Gilliam knew what he was doing when choosing the phrase to knock up instead of a plethora of other &#x96; non-sexual-innuendo &#x96; phrases that he could have chosen instead. Perhaps my suspicion would not have been aroused had Gilliam not been such a STAUNCH defender of Roman Polanski's rights a few years back when the matter of his extradition to the States was all over the media.

Probably what makes it so chilling is the terrible events are entirely plausible.One reviewer here said that this film was about how violence (real violence) affects people, I won't repeat his review because he explains it more eloquently than I, but I totally agree.But interestingly enough as a woman it seemed to me that this movie was also examining masculinity but none of the male reviewers here have mentioned that, so I may be wrong. But I feel this way because it is noticeable to me how differently the men react, compared to women, to trauma. After the male rape not only is it never mentioned again but even initially when Ned is rescued it is not mentioned. I feel women would at least have a cry and hug each other first, but I may be wrong, because shock can manifest in different ways. However all of the men react in the same seemingly unemotional way, of course it is obvious that the men are traumatised by the event but their reaction is to protect their friend and fix the problem. And their way of fixing the problem is by not talking about it. Of course, part of the reason this event can't be discussed is because it is so emasculating. But their caring is obvious in little vignettes, for instance when Jon Voight helps Ned dress after the rape. Why men suppress emotions is something I have not always understood and at times has annoyed me, but this movie was such an insight for me, as I finally got it. We women know how to let out emotion safely, but men are so trained to suppress it that when it does happen it is often like a dam bursting then they can't control it, so it's safer to bottle it up.But the sad thing is though that their suppression will have terrible effects on them, this is one of the reasons therapists often say people shouldn't bury their problem (never was a metaphor so apt as in this film), however letting it out will make them crack, so they can't win, if they talk about it or suppress it, either way it will affect their sanity.Mind you even as a woman I could understand that many women would want to bottle up an event as traumatic as this one.Depressingly enough most movies when women get raped there is often something still sexy about the way it is shot but the male rape scene here is so sudden and so chilling you feel their helplessness and you know that if they aren't rescued that they will be killed and horribly, and you know they know this. Often rape reports deal with the violation but this scene really brings home to you the thought of not just the violation but the sheer terror that victims must feel, so I think this scene would be equally illustrative of what both men and women would experience.Even before the rape, it is obvious to me that all these men feel inadequate as men. Macho Lewis is over compensating, whiny Ned boasts about sexual conquests because he knows how unmanly he seems.So they want adventure (ie violence) so to transform themselves into real men, but ironically they don't understand that real violence isn't an adventure. Weirdly enough what should be considered emasculating, the horrible rape Ned experiences, is actually what transforms him into a real man, one who is scared but determined to survive and help his friends.Lewis almost does the opposite he goes from being the strong survivalist (though who undoubtedly saves them) to being terrified and in visible distress from his injury and helplessness.But I don't think the movie is saying that he is a coward. I think the movie shows them all as true human beings, they all show great courage at times but are also reduced to absolute terror at other times as anyone experiencing such horrors would. But that's part of the point is that you can not have true courage without real fear.So unlike the comic book heroes that they wanted to emulate, true heroism evolves from enduring terrible trauma.And it makes me wonder if perhaps one of the reasons that war veterans do not speak of war isn't just because of the horrors they saw but perhaps they are also ashamed of the times that they showed fear, no matter how courageous they may have been, deep down they may feel like cowards.The sad thing is that I think that the characters here will be forever traumatised and feel emasculated by what happened to them but the events were also the making of them as courageous heroes but they probably won't see it that way, but I had no doubt that Ned would go away being stronger, kinder and less brash to others and that Lewis would become more humble and that Jon Voight would appreciate his family more.This is one of the few movies I've seen adult male rape in, and society rarely mentions it too. I think issues such as this should be explored more in cinema, so that men who have experienced such terrible trauma can at least feel that the issue is being addressed in some way. Because let's face it part of the reason why Ned and the other characters can't speak about the rape is because society has deemed adult male rape to be an unspeakably shameful subject.

However, I get the feeling that you don't need to see it in order to understand or appreciate this one. Although the plot leaves a lot to be desired and it's probably about 20 minutes too long, it's still good-natured and has a lot of humor, to boot. Clint Eastwood plays Philo Beddoe, a truck driver who also does bare-knuckle fighting, and he's accompanied by an orangutan named Clyde. The basic story is that Philo has quit fighting, but he gets strong-armed by the Mafia into doing one final fight. At the same time, he's being pursued by a Neo-Nazi biker gang called The Black Widows. While I wasn't really into this type of movie, and it certainly is not one of the better things that Clint Eastwood has been in, there were a lot of individually funny scenes that made me laugh a lot. Not only that, but they actually follow up on a lot of the gags. That's probably the highest praise I can give this movie. Other than that, the plot is a muddled mess. It seems like they just threw a bunch of stuff at the wall to see what would stick. Despite having a bunch of elements that were funny on their own, they never really gelled to make a coherent narrative. For what it's worth, all of the performances were at least decent, but Eastwood seemed like he was just going through the motions at times. The best performance of the movie, however, was the orangutan who played Clyde. There's also some good soundtrack cuts, even if I don't quite like country\/western music. Last, but not least, the fighting, despite not having a lot of it, was pretty good and well-filmed. Overall, I wasn't too impressed with ANY WHICH WAY YOU CAN, but I wasn't too bored and I laughed more than a few times. It's on the bottom end of Clint Eastwood's resume in terms of quality, but you could do a lot worse.

No, it really literally is a propaganda film where one side is getting viciously vilified, the other side is wholly righteous and victimized and there is a very clear motivational message told to the viewer.This is different from a normal heroic movie where there is a clear villain and a clear protagonist. Such exaggeration of characters in a normal film is for the viewer's benefit because the viewer gets more enthralled in the characters actions and more entertained when they succeed. In propaganda films it is not for the viewer's benefit and you can feel that! Propaganda films feel preachy and pushy as their purpose is not entertainment, even though they may be entertaining in the process. Such films therefore have a disgusting core, and unfortunately, for all its epic feel, Battleship Potemkin is no different.Besides that, when this film tries to convince the viewer it on occasion misses its mark or is hilariously corny. A grown man gets slapped on the back a couple of times in his sleep and that gets him crying. It just feels awkward, like the movie is trying to look for trouble everywhere, clutching at straws.Other times it just does not explain things well. There is a scene where the men look at an officer with contempt but does not give a reason for it, until later I realised that it was because the sailors were refusing to eat.Visually Battleship Potemkin is very impressive. It is very good at conveying its propaganda with simple to understand messages and symbolism. It is also good at creating tension, surprise, atmosphere and just showing off some pretty maritime scenery. There are a few interesting special effects and cool camera movements during the famous stairway sequence.However, as already mentioned, the events are not always shown clearly and it goes overboard with the its propaganda scenery to the extreme. There are other oddities too, like a gun clearly not pointing at a person and yet the person falls to the ground anyway after the gun is fired. There are also a number of scenes that drag on for a too long with nothing important happening, and that in a movie that is only about an hour long. If you cut out all the unnecessary bits the movie would probably not be more than 30 minutes. It only has 3 events to show (though the film divides them into 5 parts).The best thing about this film was the music. It was not just providing the mood but also the sound effects for what was happening on screen, which was not a standard thing for silent movies at the time, and the music managed to do so without losing its flow and without stopping being music, so that if you remove the movie, the orchestral music is still really interesting. It has a bombastic modern feel to it of a Hans Zimmer composition but a timeless sensibility of the classical music.Now, to take that support away a little, if you see the modern version of the movie you will likely get the remastered version of the soundtrack, and no doubt the original quality would have been lower.The most pleasant thing about this film is its presentation, consisting of an epic and lively soundtrack and visuals. But its story is presented awkwardly, with the political pushing being uncomfortably obvious and other awkwardness in the scenes. This film has plenty of sins.

I started to buy the book, but to my regret I did not, and so I never got to read the essay. However, I think I am safe in saying that Missing in Action was one of the movies the essay would have discussed, along with Rambo II.People who worry about words will quibble as to whether we lost the Vietnam War. Well, we did not lose it in the sense that we were not conquered by the Viet Cong, but we lost in the sense that we failed in our mission, that we gave up, pulled out, and let the Viet Cong take control of the entire country. And that made us feel bad.But it is Hollywood's job to create a better world than the one we actually have to live in. Now, Hollywood could not make a movie showing us conquering the Viet Cong and making the country safe for democracy, because the direct contradiction to reality would have been too stark. Instead, it made a movie in which an individual soldier, Colonel James Braddock, along with a few associates, goes back to Vietnam and succeeds in freeing some American soldiers still being held in a prisoner-of-war camp.The Vietnamese government categorically denies having these prisoners, but to what end is a mystery. We simply have to assume that they just enjoy making these American prisoners of war miserable, or that they know that we know they have the prisoners, and that they just enjoy frustrating American efforts to get them back. In either event, they are mean and spiteful.But what is important is that they give Braddock a mission that he can carry out. The first part of Braddock's mission is to appear at a diplomatic function and display his contempt, as when he refuses to shake hands with a Vietnamese general. This ostensibly is directed toward the general, but it is really a put-down of American politicians who think that diplomacy is the way to get things done.The second part of his mission is to personally kill the general and a high-ranking officer who is shown through a flashback to be cruel and evil. This allows him some personal revenge before he sets out to kill a bunch of generic bad guys.The third part of his mission is to sneak into the jungle and free the American prisoners. Braddock and his few associates kill over ten times their number in doing so, proving that the American soldier is a vastly superior to his Vietnamese counterpart. You see, it was embarrassing that the world's greatest superpower was unable to defeat such a puny country. This movie essentially declares that it must have been a bunch of spineless politicians back home that caused America to lose the war, probably the same sort that are busy being polite at diplomatic functions, because it is clear that men like Braddock would have won the war given the chance to do so.This movie allows us some imaginary revenge against an enemy that humiliated us, and that makes us feel good. Of course, we would have felt a whole lot better if the movie had actually been entertaining instead of dull and plodding.

Well, we did not lose it in the sense that we were not conquered by the Viet Cong, but we lost in the sense that we failed in our mission, that we gave up, pulled out, and let the Viet Cong take control of the entire country. And that made us feel bad.But it is Hollywood's job to create a better world than the one we actually have to live in. Now, Hollywood could not make a movie showing us conquering the Viet Cong and making the country safe for democracy, because the direct contradiction to reality would have been too stark. Instead, it made a movie in which an individual soldier, Colonel James Braddock, along with a few associates, goes back to Vietnam and succeeds in freeing some American soldiers still being held in a prisoner-of-war camp.The Vietnamese government categorically denies having these prisoners, but to what end is a mystery. We simply have to assume that they just enjoy making these American prisoners of war miserable, or that they know that we know they have the prisoners, and that they just enjoy frustrating American efforts to get them back. In either event, they are mean and spiteful.But what is important is that they give Braddock a mission that he can carry out. The first part of Braddock's mission is to appear at a diplomatic function and display his contempt, as when he refuses to shake hands with a Vietnamese general. This ostensibly is directed toward the general, but it is really a put-down of American politicians who think that diplomacy is the way to get things done.The second part of his mission is to personally kill the general and a high-ranking officer who is shown through a flashback to be cruel and evil. This allows him some personal revenge before he sets out to kill a bunch of generic bad guys.The third part of his mission is to sneak into the jungle and free the American prisoners. Braddock and his few associates kill over ten times their number in doing so, proving that the American soldier is a vastly superior to his Vietnamese counterpart. You see, it was embarrassing that the world's greatest superpower was unable to defeat such a puny country. This movie essentially declares that it must have been a bunch of spineless politicians back home that caused America to lose the war, probably the same sort that are busy being polite at diplomatic functions, because it is clear that men like Braddock would have won the war given the chance to do so.This movie allows us some imaginary revenge against an enemy that humiliated us, and that makes us feel good. Of course, we would have felt a whole lot better if the movie had actually been entertaining instead of dull and plodding.

That's outrageous! Worst movie ever! That's the problem with many of the comments and some of the reviews of this film here on IMDb. Some of our viewers went to see a Keanu Reeves movie because he was hot. And I guess he was in his own way. But when you think about it, this was not a KR movie. It was an ensemble film. KR wasn't on-screen even half of the time.People do like to hit on Keanu Reeves. And, while I doubt many would say he was ever the world's finest actor, with $3,599,064,053 worldwide aggregate box office (rank #31), he must have been doing something right. I look at some of the criticisms here and just laugh. For example, the accent was wrong. Even though I'm Buddhist and traveled fairly extensively in parts of Asia, I've never actually met a person from Nepal, so I have no idea whether his accent was appropriate or not, particularly since there would be NO APPROPRIATE ACCENT that we could fathom from 2,500 years ago. Let's see, how many people from Siddhartha's village spoke English 2,500 years ago????? Reeves did nicely here, and I quite admire how he emaciated himself to be able to portray the fasting Buddha.If one wants to criticize some acting here, I suggest targeting in on Chris Isaak, who turns in a stunningly bad performance. I don't know how he has done in acting since, but this was pitiful. Stiff. Unnatural. He didn't even move realistically.Another of the criticisms of this film is that, in terms of Buddhism, it is not very realistic. Really? Is that why 3 actual Tibetan incarnate lamas have significant roles in the film? Some people say that American boy is not realistic. I don't know about that. As a teacher\/school administrator, I've met plenty of precocious children, and this performance seems rather realistic. After all, he isn't meant to be the average all-American boy; he's supposed to be different.Ying Ruocheng is superb as the main lama in the film. And Sogyal Rinpoche's performance was charming, and about as realistic as you can get since he is actually a leading Tibetan lama in real life.The performance of the other two children in the film are interesting, particularly the girl with self-importance and self-promotional skills...that surprised me a bit...I wonder if that would be realistic for someone like that to be a reincarnated lama.Special mention should be made of the photography. It is interesting how the cinematographer gave the film a different warmth depending on whether they were in Seattle, or Tibet, or back in Buddha's time. Quite lovely, really. And the sets and special effects helped tell the basic bio of young Buddha's life.Financially, this was a disaster at the box office. Which is what I would expect since it was clearly a niche film with an all too big budget. Casting Keanu Reeves may have been an attempt to cash in on a rising star's box office mojo, and clearly some of our reviewers went to the film to see KR, rather than because of the subject of the film.For me, a lot about this film comes down to how I feel as a Buddhist about non-Buddhist Americans (and others) watching this film. Does it present Buddhism as it really is? Yes and no. I'm a mix of a Theravadan (as in Thai) Buddhist and a philosophical Buddhist, and the film doesn't portray those schools at all (beyond the fable-istic telling of the life of Siddhartha\/Buddha; it is a depiction of Vajrayāna Buddhism. My impression is that it depicts Vajrayana Buddhism fairly well, but that gives the impression that Buddhism is based on animism (e.g., the appearance of the seer), and to be honest, there is a lot of animism in Buddhism in the way it is approached in the Old World.Normally, based on only the cinematic aspects of this film, I would give it a 7. However, I'm going to bump it up to a 8 because it has one quality that separates it from typical popular cinema -- it is something different and unique.

BLACK DOG is a fairly standard late-90's B-grade action movie, but its colorful characters help it to transcend the genre clichés and make it somewhat memorable. The basic plot is that Jack Crews (Patrick Swayze) is in need of some extra money and agrees to take a truck-driving job transporting some goods. Little does he know that it's some illegal guns, and soon he has people on his trail as he tries to make the delivery.I've never been too much of a Patrick Swayze fan, mostly because I don't think he can act that well. He has some charisma, for sure, but the only movie I've really enjoyed him in prior to this was ROAD HOUSE. Here, he doesn't get that kind of a role to play, but thankfully the supporting players pick up the slack and make the movie worth watching. Of those cast members, the most entertaining were Meat Loaf as a Bible-quoting madman, and Charles Dutton and Stephen Tobolowsky as a bickering FBI and ATF agent, respectively. Their short scene that opens the film is, in my opinion, the best part and sort of sets the tone for what follows, at least when they're on screen. Randy Travis also has a supporting role, but all they can do with him is make jokes and references to his real-life career as a country singer.In general, the acting was decent for this type of movie. The action, of course, was well-done. By virtue of being produced before Hollywood became obsessed with CGI and shaky-cam, this film features real stunts, real explosions and crisp, clean action sequences done with some flair. Yes, having cars and trucks explode on impact in a collision is ridiculous, but it's also ridiculously entertaining to watch. Most importantly, the truck-driving sequences were filmed in an interesting way, and actually on the highway. Other positives I can think of are a suitably bombastic score and some gentle soundtrack cuts courtesy of Randy Travis. I don't really care for country music, but he's one person I can tolerate.The negative aspects I can mention are all fairly standard for the genre. There's a lot of plot holes, story threads that aren't followed up on (or at least satisfactorily), and of course the premise. Part of this can be chalked up to the run time. At 89 minutes, it is a little light on story and character development, but then again it didn't exactly need to be complex. Overall, this was much more fun than I was anticipating.

Something about it, sets this one apart from the other two, this one a longer time span from the second entry. This is such a fresh third entry, and we are riveted from the word Go and if you're a revenge fan, it's an added bonus here. Part of the scenario has John Maclaine's past catching up with him, and that it does, in a cleverly constructed scenario that has the chief villain, terrorist Simon Gruber (a fantastic Jeremy Irons) create a diversion, using our hero, to act upon these requests (the first ones a killer, using the N word, hence the start of Jackson's arrival) and working out riddles and math, what have you.

And, of course, as always Robert De Nero delivers. In the scenes that they share, they have an wonderful dynamic. The other 'great' in this film is of course Marlon Brando. Whilst at the very end of his career and therefore lowest ebb of his professional life, he still manages a performance that's above most other lesser actors' best.The cinematography is lovely to watch. The lighting in Nick's apartment fits the mood of this film perfectly. And the pacing is just right. All-in-all, all of the people involved did a wonderful job. It's a pleasure to watch.The story itself concerns a heist at the Montreal Customs House. Instigated by Edward Norton's character (Jack Teller), Robert De Nero's (Nick Wells) aging professional thief decides to take on One Last Job, despite that job containing some less-than-ideal risks (including it being located in his home town.) The story is ostensibly about Jack's wish to have one big score, Nick's desire to retire comfortably and live out the rest of his days as an ordinary businessman, and Jack and Nick's attempts to outdo one another. Thrown into the mix is Marlon Brando's (Max's) role as a fixer, putting one in contact with the other.The above plot points are, however, as in all good thrillers, merely MacGuffins. The real story lies in the interplay between the characters. Their various strengths, weaknesses and motivations are revealed as the story moves along towards its conclusion. Like all good anti-heroes, there's much to admire and to despise in each character. I particularly enjoyed the scenes between Jack and a rent-a-thug hired by Nick. It was very well done, and demonstrated both the toughness and the self-control of Edward Norton's character, Jack.I'd put this film in my top ten of all time across all genres. It's not quite on a par with Heat (my all-time how does this compare to? film in the crime genre), but it's still pretty damn good. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 December 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This film shows, more than any other, what a brilliant actor Edward Norton is.

One of favorite aspect of this movie was how they didn't just tell the story of Kane's life beginning to end as most movies do, the way Welles used Kane's last words rosebud as more of an object through which the rest of plot developed was very interesting. My biggest complaint with the film is that throughout the movie there are several key characters and while brilliantly acted, I never fully understood who they were. If I watched the film over again I would probably understand who everyone was but in my opinion it took something away from the story. These characters were very interesting and each had a different perspective on who Mr. Kane was, I feel that if I could distinguish his account from his best friend I think this would have added more to the experience for me.Another aspect I really enjoyed about the movie was the acting. Although as previously mentioned sometimes it was hard to distinguish who was who, but the performances were still really good. Orson Welles did an amazing job as the rich powerful, but never happy newspaper tycoon, Charles Foster Kane. I really enjoyed seeing how Mr. Kane reacted to money and wealth and how as he gotten older he looked at the world differently. Also Dorothy Comingore who played Susan Alexander Kane had a wonderful performance that really showed the emotional toll of living with Mr. Kane. The way her character developed really highlighted how Mr. Kane changed throughout the film and really added something to the movie.The only other problem I had with the movie is in some parts the movie was slow. This was not a huge part of the movie but some scenes seemed to drag on a little to long.In Conclusion, Is it 'The greatest in cinema history' as some have said? I don't think so. With that being said is it possible that I just didn't appreciate the movie fully. Probably. I think it was well directed, acted, and had an interesting story. I will definitely want to watch the movie again and maybe after a second viewing I will understand its full brilliance. Util then, I think this is a great movie that definitely made cinema history at the time and has only been getting more respected as time goes on. I would definitely recommend you see this move and make your own conclusion.

Although as previously mentioned sometimes it was hard to distinguish who was who, but the performances were still really good. Orson Welles did an amazing job as the rich powerful, but never happy newspaper tycoon, Charles Foster Kane. I really enjoyed seeing how Mr. Kane reacted to money and wealth and how as he gotten older he looked at the world differently. Also Dorothy Comingore who played Susan Alexander Kane had a wonderful performance that really showed the emotional toll of living with Mr. Kane. The way her character developed really highlighted how Mr. Kane changed throughout the film and really added something to the movie.The only other problem I had with the movie is in some parts the movie was slow. This was not a huge part of the movie but some scenes seemed to drag on a little to long.In Conclusion, Is it 'The greatest in cinema history' as some have said? I don't think so. With that being said is it possible that I just didn't appreciate the movie fully. Probably. I think it was well directed, acted, and had an interesting story. I will definitely want to watch the movie again and maybe after a second viewing I will understand its full brilliance. Util then, I think this is a great movie that definitely made cinema history at the time and has only been getting more respected as time goes on. I would definitely recommend you see this move and make your own conclusion.

One of favorite aspect of this movie was how they didn't just tell the story of Kane's life beginning to end as most movies do, the way Welles used Kane's last words rosebud as more of an object through which the rest of plot developed was very interesting. My biggest complaint with the film is that throughout the movie there are several key characters and while brilliantly acted, I never fully understood who they were.
