I prefer Wes Anderson's Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou -- they're both equally pretentious, however Life Aquatic was funnier to me and also more appealing because its themes were better developed than Tenenbaums, which deals with so many characters that it can become a bit muddled at times.I like both films, though. This one's advantage is that it came first and therefore the whimsical, wacky nature of the story was more original (Rushmore was weird too, but in a more traditional sense).Royal Tenenbaums stars Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum, an ex-millionaire who has been exiled by his family and lives alone in a fancy apartment downtown - until he loses all his cash and is kicked out onto the streets.Faced with nothing, he tells his family he is dying of stomach cancer in the hopes that they will accept him back into their lives.The family - Anjelica Huston, Luke Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Stiller - don't care one way or another, except for Stiller, a braniac whiz-kid who has grown up into a neurotic man. His wife has just died and he's alone with his two kids, wanting nothing to do with the father he never had as a child.There are other wacky characters - Bill Murray as Paltrow's shrink husband, Danny Glover as an associate of Huston's (and a potential love interest), and Owen Wilson playing Luke Wilson's best friend.The movie is good and I admire how its fairy-tale\/children's book-structure is so well captured - even with the turning pages that appear on screen to introduce new chapters of the story.But overall I was left feeling a little underwhelmed when it was over, thinking I preferred Life Aquatic a bit more because I just found it more easily accessible in terms of humor and narrative.Royal Tenenbaums is pretentious and showy, but if you like unique films, you'll find something worthwhile here.

Well, this movie shows just that, but not in a cheesy, run of the mill sort of way. This is the story of Tombstone.Tombstone stars Kurt Russell as the legendary Wyatt Earp, the U.S. Marshall known for 'keeping the peace'. He and his two brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) decide to head out to the town of Tombstone. It's a place where you can make it rich and quick, too. Wyatt decides to grab a share of the local saloon\/casino called The Oriental. Making all of this money and having a good time is all they want to think about. They just want to leave they're past behind them. Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer) wants to do the same thing. With his lung condition worsening, he is trying to live life to the fullest...that is gambling, drinking, smoking, and doing his marital duties with his wife Kate. A traveling group of actors and performers roll into town put on a show for Tombstone. Josephine Marcus (Dana Delaney) and Mr. Fabian (Billy Zane) sweep the town off of their feet with their charm and talents. Josephine is attracted to Wyatt's ruggedness and mystery. Wyatt tries not to be tempted even though his drug addicted girl friend doesn't help his cause much. With all of this going on in Tombstone it seems like it will be easy sailing for Wyatt and his crew...until they have a run in with the Cowboys.Led by Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), this gang has been terrorizing the west for a number of years. They are the law in the town of Tombstone. They influence everything from the sheriff to the saloons. When the local marshal is shot by Curly Bill, Wyatt locks him up this is when the cowboys start to make trouble. Virgil and Morgan soon sign up as the new Sheriff's in town and Wyatt doesn't want any part of it. Doc has become enemies with one of the quickest and skilled guns in the west named Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). When Wyatt is forced into help keep the peace, there is the showdown at the O.K. Carral that would just become more of the legend of Wyatt Earp and his band of law men.Tombstone is a great film with a lot of action, drama, and even some comedic moments. The screenplay is fantastic with Wyatt Doc having some great conversations. Russell, Kilmer, Elliott, and Paxton all give good performances. Kilmer especially shows his range as an actor with his charm and charisma not scene in this way before. The ailing Doc Holiday is an interesting character to portray and Kilmer nails it. Along with Doc, Wyatt couldn't be just another law enforcer. He had to have a soft side and a mean streak as well. Russell give Wyatt a feeling of accomplishment, like he has done what he has set out to do. But when things go wrong, he is the first one you want on your side.Fans of westerns, have no fear because Tombstone is hear!

On the way to wherever he was going an assassination attempt leaves Benes with a serious brain injury & in a coma. Charles Grant (Stephen Boyd) is taken the the top secret Government organisation the 'Combined Miniature Deterrence Forces' where he is told by General Carter (Edmond O'Brien) that he will oversee an operation by brain surgeon Dr. Peter Duvall (Arthur Kennedy) & his technical assistant Cora Peterson (Raquel Welch). Grant is confused & says there is no reason for him to be present, General Carter goes on to say that he will be placed in a submarine, miniaturised & injected into Benes arterial system & travel to the injury which is the only way to operate on the blood clot in his brain without killing him. There are however a couple of problems, they can only be miniaturised for 60 minutes & that there may be a saboteur among the crew as the 'other side' doesn't want Benes to talk. Together with the pilot Captain Bill Owens (William Redfield), Dr. Duvall & Cora plus Dr. Maxwell Michaels (Donald Pleasence) Grant boards the sub which is then miniaturised & injected into Benes. Things don't go according to plan as the team encounter various obstacles that they must overcome in a race against time to save Benes & eventually themselves...Directed by Richard Fleischer I thought Fantastic Voyage was a very enjoyable piece of 60's Sci-Fi adventure that has not dated that well but still entertains & is good fun to watch on a lazy afternoon. The script by Harry Kleiner moves along at a nice pace, has a good solid if somewhat simple story that engages, manages to maintain interest & is very focused as it doesn't get distracted with silly sub-plots like any sort of romantic nonsense. There is a nice underlying current of mistrust as we know one of the team is a saboteur & the various problems the team encounter provide some nice scenes. Fantastic Voyage hasn't dated well, some of the 'futuristic' looking technology & the medical equipment simply don't hold up these days but I thought it gave the film a certain naive charm & innocence about it. The special effects won't impress anyone theses days used to the latest multi million CGI stuff but everything considered they aren't too bad & I've definitely seen worse. I'm not sure how accurately Fantastic Voyage depicts the inside of the human body, I personally thought it would have been more red but maybe I'm wrong. Whether Fantastic Voyage is accurate or not doesn't really matter as this is pure science fiction & the overall look & feel of these scenes is very good & memorable. Technically Fantastic Voyage is very good with some nice colourful sets & production design, some unconvincing special effects the only real aspect that lets Fantastic Voyage down today. The acting is OK & no one is going to win an Oscar, I also thought the casting of the bad guy gives him away a little too easily if you now what I mean & I'm surprised Richard Basehart isn't here somewhere! Raquel Welsh fans get to see her in tight fitting scuba gear which shows her best assets off quite well... I like Fantastic Voyage, it's good fun for all the family despite it age.

The original was a ripoff of the better Die Hard, which is one of my favorites. Granted that it was as such, I still enjoyed the hell out of it. I didn't think there'd be a sequel, I didn't even know they made a sequel, I'm sure most people didn't. There was somebody who thought this would be a good idea, armed with crappy actors and driving around on a train (I hate traveling this way) and zapping things with a laser, I didn't know if I was going to be given some good action. Probably written while watching another film, it really doesn't deliver anything but action. I was disappointed by this film's villain, not only is he a loser but he's a geek who dies in a crappy way.I was sort of reminded of Air Force One, that came out two years later. Did that ripoff this classic? I doubt it! Unlike Air Force One however, we are given a fat man with a ponytail. Sure Seagal was good for that one year he had in the 80s, but his style of slapping people around and breaking limbs is over. Notice how we ditched that toad Jean-Claude Van Damme as well? Well Seagal doesn't have an appeal to him, Ah-nuld can throw out one liners, and we'll pay to see it again. Unlike the governor however, I have never found Seagal to have any personality, even when he tries to force it.Now as I mentioned, the story sucked. The acting was too good either, from the loser thugs talking about Oh, maybe he is dead, what's with this crap? I mean given simple logic, I would shoot the guy in the head, rather than in the arm. But I guess if you pay the best mercenaries in the world, chances are there will be another one who is a little smarter than those you bought. What a waste.So of course Seagal saves the day.

It has been chronicled in silent films (1912's Save the Titanic), as the basis for a Nazi propaganda film (1943's of Titanic), a historical drama (1958's A Night to Remember), and most recently a romantic epic drama (James Cameron's Titanic). Jean Negulesco's 1953 version of Titanic tries to be like a historical drama and fictional drama at the same time, succeeding in some areas, but failing in most areas.Rich, upper-class married Julia Sturges (Barbara Stanwyck) separates from her stuffy and uptight husband Richard (Clifton Webb), wanting to bring up her teenage daughter (Audrey Dalton) and young son as middle class Americans in Michigan. Richard doesn't want his kids to have such low lifestyle, so after buying a ticket from a steerage passenger aboard the Titanic, is set to stop his wife from taking his kids. Aboard the ship, the daughter strikes up a romance with an American college student (Robert Wagner), a defrocked priest (Richard Baseheart) is running away from his own problems, and the eventful April 15 sinking of Titanic will change everyone's lives forever.Let me start off with the positives. As a historical drama, this movie does pretty well in most areas. The sets are pretty awesome in scope and detail. You get the sense of the vastness of the Titanic from the many rooms and wide shots throughout the film. While it is normal for Hollywood to take artistic license with anything that has historical significance, the things that I know beforehand and know are historically inaccurate, I can't let fly by. There was no explosion on board the Titanic as it would've been impossible, right before the Titanic sank in the ocean the passengers didn't stop and sing a Welsh hymn. Those two things that happened in the movie really bothered me as anyone who is not familiar with the Titanic should know that stuff never happened. Hollywood can take artistic license as long its believable to some degree.Now the movie as a drama is so uneven I may not have the right words to get my point across, but I'll try my best. The actors are for the most part great. Barbara Stanwyck has yet to fail me. Clifton Webb as well. He is very good as unhumorous, spoiled man who wants to do things for his benefit and his ways. They both have a sincere love and understanding for each other as characters, yet still have a true yearning to do things their own ways for their own reasons. This was my first Audrey Dalton film, and she gives a well enriched performance as an arrogant, stuck up, spoiled rich girl, who knows that the one thing she can't buy is love and wants it from the right person. Thelma Ritter who plays a Molly Brown like character is fantastic as usual. She delivers lines like she was born to say them. Another one that has never failed me. Richard Baseheart is also very good, and quite possibly the best actor in the film, as the priest who is running away from his own demons. There is a scene with him and Barbara Stanwyck in his cabin and she finds out he was priest. The monologue he gives about his family and his reasons why he left the priesthood is so poignant and heartbreaking. The one who has though in this film, is Robert Wagner. I personally feel his character is so out of place, like he is from the wrong time period. His dialogue, actions, and overall conduct seem too 1950's for me. It seems more that he should be more in a 50's sitcom as an older brother like in Leave it to Beaver. His romance with Audrey Dalton works, mostly because Dalton isn't so upfront with her emotions. I could believe more that she loved him, and not the other way around.While having good actors is a plus, the writing and direction are another story in there own ways. Jean Negulesco unfortunately doesn't seem to know pacing because the movie at many times just seems to stop, with characters just talking. The actors are great to watch, but even a great speaker should know when to stop talking and take his seat. I understand this is a melodrama, but even melodramas should have their own distinct pacing. The writing is probably the worst, which surprises me as there were three of Hollywood's most adept screenwriters writing on this film. Charles Brackett wrote another great melodrama with Billy Wilder, Sunset Blvd., but I have no idea what went wrong here. The dialogue ranges from good to acceptable with the actor's delivering the worst lines in the best way they can.Titanic is a movie not for people looking for history of the Titanic. It is for people who like Hollywood melodramas. If you want to see the best film about Titanic in my opinion, see A Night to Remember.

In fact, it meshes well with most of his films, in that this is a film with a social conscience, after all. The screen play by Robert Riskin has some awkward moments, but the finished product proves that Mr. Capra could turn any script into a movie with great success. While this film is not in the same league as his other masterpieces, it is still a good way to spend some time with good company.Much has been said in this forum about the merits of YCTIWY. The cast of this film is Hollywood at its best. Lionel Barrymore makes a great contribution with his Martin Vanderhof, the patriarch of the crazy household where happiness lives. Vanderhof's life is full because of his family and the friends he welcomes to share whatever he has, asking nothing in return. He is a rich man, indeed.By contrast, Anthony Kirby, the Wall Street millionaire, is a miserable human being. His whole aim in life is to amass a fortune that he will not be able to spend at all. He is reminded by Vanderhof that his life is worth nothing because he has no friends. Edward Arnold does wonders portraying this unhappy man, in perhaps, the best performance of his long film career. Mr. Arnold was a great actor.The other notable character in the film is Alice Sycamore, the young secretary that happens to fall in love with the rich Kirby heir. In fact, she has the pivotal role of telling off the father of the man she loves because she sees the older Kirby for what he really stands. As Alice, the wonderful Jean Arthur takes the role and makes a splash with it.James Stewart has a minor role in this film, in comparison to the above mentioned ones. Ann Miller is charming as the happy would be ballerina Essie. Spring Byington makes a great Penny, the woman who can write plays in the middle of all the confusion going on in the Vanderhof household. There is a small scene where the incomparable Charles Lane, an actor that has been seen in innumerable films in minor roles, who plays a tax collector. The rest of the cast is excellent.

Then came the horrible sequel, starring an obese Danny Devito, my hero Christopher Walken and Ms. Pfeiffer. That one was just as bad. So I am met with Batman Forever, a film that is just a lot more fun that the others. Sure it's filled with constant homosexual closeups of asses, and a weird relationship between the bad guys, but I'm strong enough with my sexuality to get through this spectacle. Only until this years Batman Begins did I like Batman movies, because I had been a fan of the comics and cartoon show when I was a kid.This one had two villains for some reason. Why? Two-Face is played by Tommy Lee Jones, not like the real Two-Face who has many more problems that in this film, but in kind of a manic comedian with an ugly birth mark. Jim Carrey was The Riddler, and had me laughing the bulk of the film. Jim is funny period, if you didn't like Dumb and Dumber, I feel sorry for you because you should be buried as we speak. I liked both the villains, although they were over the top, they were fun. Val Kilmer's Batman was the best out of the three (Bob Kane, the creator of Batman said this as well, I'll trust his judgment). Chris O' Donnell was plain annoying and when his family is smashed, I laugh every time. I read recently that Christian Bale tried out for Robin, thank God Mr. Donnell got the part, what a loser. Nicole Kidman looked really hot in this film. For some reason, she never gained that hotness in anything else, which is why I switched my attention to Ms. Hallie Berry. Whoa Baby! The story is corny, Riddler puts a mind control device on TV's and sucks brain waves. See a little more fairy juice for you. But I thought the good thing about this movie is the the comedic tone. I couldn't take the first two Batmans' serious, and yet that's what they were trying to be. This one was bad funny, but still funny.I don't care what anyone says, but the Burton Batman flicks just aren't that good.

The story is thin, the actors are bad, the characters are seriously weird and the horror\/comedy mix is as awful as it can get! I could write a very long list of errors and flops in this movie, but lets make it short. I want to focus on some of the big flops\/questions this movie contains The biggest question is HOW DID THAT OLD LADY GET THOSE CRODODILLES? How can she tame them when they are adults? if you think of it, every one that tries to tame a Lion or a Tiger knows that these animals are not used to be pets, so its impossible to tame a animal that large. And by the way why oh why do that old lady have Cows, horses, chickens next to a lake? When you live near a lake, you DO NOT run a farm, you go fishing in the lake!!!!! The characters are seriously weird! At points they can work together, and even talk normally, but suddenly they just flip out and begins to yell and argue about something that isn't important! Another problem is with the role Bridget Fonda plays (Katty or something (from now on called Katty). She is letting us know something about her1) allergic to trees 2) hate Moquitoes 3) hate Ticks (the nasty little treehanging animal) 4) doesn't know what camping isShe is supposed to be a Big City girl who don't know anything about nature. But the problem is that she HAS been to lakes like lake Placid as a kid!!!!!!! She says that she always spent time at a lake, throwing stones at the water. But how can she suddenly have an allergy for trees? how can she NOT know that camping is used to be in tents?It makes no sense that she HAS been out of the city as a child, but as an adult cannot be a minute at a Lake in Maine!!!! And by the way When she is helping the policeman (which she is (at some points) in love with) in the tent, she is telling that her father was a surgeon. Well it could be, but do surgeons use plaster? do Suregeons use plaster when they a finished with an operation? The answer is NO!!! Its a lame dialog, as all the other dialogs in this movie!!!The investigation team is not investigating, they are just fooling around trying to find an animal, which they don't know what is and what to do with!! And here another question Which animal does the old policeman (who hates Hector) suspect is the killer? He doesn't think that it is a crocodile, so what animal did attack the boat in the middle of the lake? The Loch Ness monster? a underwater bear? A beaver? a Fish? This is so weird as it can get! When I found out that this was a comedy-Horror film, i knew why it wasn't as scary as it could be, but still the movie sucks!!!!! Its NOT funny, its not scary, its just a boring awful movie, that should be thrown away!!!! If anyone of you have seen the horror movie about the Killer Ants, you'll know that this movie is even WORSE than that. the movie about the ants did actually have a point, and did NOT just be a movie about some idiots that are just fooling around.Even another question Is the movie about the Crododile or about the persons? We see a lot to the persons, and not much to the animal thats killing almost everyone near the lake. But if we say its about the persons, Wy oh why do we not get any deep understanding of them? they just fool around and do NOT cooperate or do NOT let us know them! So to me, it shows that the director didn't know what the movie was about, and then just made it as it is.I think i know why its supposed to be a comedy. After making the Horror movie, he found out that is was so lame, the actors so stupid and bad, that he thought hey if we say its a comedy, we can be sure that no one is saying that the actors are bad, they just think they are playing bad, because its a comedy!

Eddie Dodd is a fascinating character type almost unique in eighties movies; a pot-smoking old hippy who used to have a set of principles and is trying to pretend he still does.

When the conservative whitebread DA accuses him of being a man who defends coke pushers for free, his response is, Coke pushers pay cash, Mr Reynard. That subsidises the pot possession cases. They're free.. The rest of the cast are excellent, with lots of great players in the small roles (Hallahan, Bower, Guzman, Fuller) and Wesley Strick's great dialogue makes them jump off the screen with immediacy. Equally good is the piano and bass score by Brad Fiedel and there is some inspired use of classic sixties anthems, as well as a great end-credits song by Lou Reed (another sixties survivor) called Busload Of Faith. All this, combined with Ruben's assured direction and classy photography by John W.

Some of the characters (hobbits, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli) are actually drawn (though they move like real people, thanks presumably to rotoscoping), and some of the characters (such as the orcs, and especially the characters in the prologue) look like live actors filmed through a red filter. But I'd rather talk about how this movie handled the story.(2) The live actors are so bad, they're a hoot. Check out the prologue The actors are all silhouetted and they STILL look like actors in a high-school play. Note especially the ultra-lame swordplay, and the laugh-out-loud display that Gollum makes of his suffering at the hands of the ring (he ducks behind a rock, holding his shaking hand up in the air and making gargling noises -- funny funny funny, so bad it's good). Also check out the live actors at the inn in Bree -- people in Renaissance costumes, pretending to be drunk, and grinning swaying dwarfs (the real kind). Hilarious.(3) The movie can't make up its mind whether the traitor wizard's name is Saruman or Aruman; he's referred to by BOTH names.(4) In the interest of brevity, the screenwriters butchered some of Gandalf's best lines, and Gandalf ends up sounding lameWhen Frodo says to Gandalf, I wish it need not have happened in my time, Gandalf says (in the book and in Peter Jackson's film -- I'm quoting from memory) So do all who live in such times, but that is not for us to decide. All we can do is decide what to do with the time that is given to us. This movie, instead, has Gandalf saying, almost absently, So do I. Lame!When Frodo says What a pity Bilbo didn't kill that vile creature (Gollum) when he had the chance, Gandalf says (in the book and in Jackson's film) It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Do not be too quick to deal out death and judgment. I feel that Gollum may yet have a critical part to play before this is over. This movie just has Gandalf say Yes -- it was pity, pity and mercy. Gee, thanks, Gandalf.(5) Samwise Gamgee comes across as a bumbling clown, with his goofy voice and flailing arm motions. But of course his flailing arm motions are nicely animated.(6) SPOILER ALERT. This movie ends abruptly. I can only imagine how much this film angered Tolkien fans back in the day. Gollum is leading Frodo and Sam toward the Secret Stair, the orcs are attacking the men of Rohan at Helm's Deep, Gandalf shows up with the formerly exiled Riders of Rohan, the orcs flee, and a narrator suddenly announces The forces of darkness were driven forever from the face of Middle Earth by the valiant friends of Frodo. As their gallant battle ended, so too ends the first great tale of The Lord of the Rings. Since the forces of darkness were driven forever from the face of Middle Earth, I guess there was no need to worry about what happened to Sam and Frodo.So this movie is only so-so -- 5 stars out of 10. Its animation is often well done and fun to watch, and parts of the film are good, but parts of the film are awful, and its handling of Tolkien's story is clumsy and ham-handed.

I almost forgot that before he made L.A. Confidential he was relatively unknown in the U.S. and it was only when he was nominated for an Oscar for The Insider that his movies became big events.That aside, this is an immensely entertaining little movie and Crowe has a very sympathetic character here. His character has many things in common with characters in other sports movies like Walter Matthau in Bad News Bears and most of these movies have a strict formula. They usually revolve around underdogs and here we get a local hockey team who gets a chance to play against a NHL team, the New York Rangers. There are not many ways to tamper with this formula and indeed Mystery, Alaska does not stray from it. Instead we get very enjoyable hockey action and the usual rivalry between the better hockey player and the one who thinks he should be the star. In this case the part is filled out nicely by Ron Eldard, who is not a household name, at least not here in Denmark, but he has made a few films that stuck with me, one of them being the revenge drama Sleepers. Here he has a much larger part and he does well as the arrogant rival to Crowe.The other supporting actors like Burt Reynolds and Hank Azaria are mostly decorative but there is no one who can play smarmy better than Azaria and Reynolds does well as a more dignified character than he has ever played before (check out his senator in Striptease to compare). The sole female, Lolita Davidovich, is terribly underwritten but that is typical of this kind of movie.Last there is a cameo by Mike Myers who of course struck gold with the director of this film and this is as it should be. So many directors do the same so why not here. The actual big game is not that extraordinary but there are enough good moments to make this a pleasant viewing experience.

Bob Hoskins' career-best portrayal of Harold Shand displays both the utter ruthlessness of the character as well as his vulnerability engendered by the chaos that descends around him. It also shows Harold as being an ethical villain, one who has principles in the way he conducts his empire. Helen Mirren is also superb as Victoria and this must rate as one of her best performances. The rest of the cast is top-notch and, while Hoskins is clearly the star character, the whole film comes across as more of an ensemble performance. The film also makes superb use of the Docklands locations and the period in which it is set many Londoners of my age get very nostalgic when watching this film as shows the East End of London at a time when the glory of the docks had faded almost into memory and before the regeneration that has transformed the landscape today. As such, it serves as a fascinating visual record of how the area looked before development.Others have commented on Hoskins' magnificent and moving performance at the very end of the film when he is being driven away from the Savoy but, for me, his speech to the two Mafia hoods embodies and illustrates the very nature of what it is to be British. One can almost hear Churchill in his voice as he berates them no red-blooded Englishman can fail to feel a certain sense of pride and agreement with his sentiments.Phil Meheux's cinematography is especially deserving of praise in particular, the shot where Harold emerges from his boat after killing Jeff is stunning. A lesser person would have cut away to Victoria as Harold descends the gangplank and then cut back to Harold. Instead, Meheux starts to follow Harold then reverses and tracks back to the top of the gangplank turning to follow Harold and thus capturing Victoria's reaction and then comes back down to ground level and tracks them to the car. The effect is subtle but one which brings a tension to the scene which would have otherwise been lost by inter-cutting.Anyone with an interest in British cinema will not be disappointed by this truly excellent example of the oeuvre.

However the dark edge of the movie was a bit too much for me and I felt as a children's tale it was probably a bit too scary.Don Bluth returned in '91 to film the sequel to his last hit, this one a satire of the westerns. Fievel the mischievous mouse returns as his parents are shipping off to Green River to escape the cats, led by Cat R. Wall (voiced by John Cleese).Along the way a spider (voiced by Jon Lovitz) tries to kill Fievel and he falls off the train, into the desert, where he pines for his feline friend from the first film (voiced by Dom DeLuise).Eventually Fievel finds his way out of the desert and finds a dog-sheriff (voiced by Jimmy Stewart) who decides to help train him so that he can fight off Cat R. Wall, who has moved out west to spread his reign of terror.I enjoy this movie more than the first one because it's not as dark (something I just have a problem with in a kid's movie). The satire isn't as strong and the whole WWII edge is lost but it still retains the cats vs. mice, which is a nice element.The animation in my opinion is more classical and the musical sequences are more lively. The voice talents are far more impressive and I love Jimmy Stewart and John Cleese in this movie - talk about great casting! Overall this is better than the original and it surprises me that more people don't actually know about it. As a nice little family adventure film it's pretty entertaining and in terms of animation it represents everything Don Bluth is known for.

Wall (voiced by John Cleese).Along the way a spider (voiced by Jon Lovitz) tries to kill Fievel and he falls off the train, into the desert, where he pines for his feline friend from the first film (voiced by Dom DeLuise).Eventually Fievel finds his way out of the desert and finds a dog-sheriff (voiced by Jimmy Stewart) who decides to help train him so that he can fight off Cat R. Wall, who has moved out west to spread his reign of terror.I enjoy this movie more than the first one because it's not as dark (something I just have a problem with in a kid's movie). The satire isn't as strong and the whole WWII edge is lost but it still retains the cats vs. mice, which is a nice element.The animation in my opinion is more classical and the musical sequences are more lively. The voice talents are far more impressive and I love Jimmy Stewart and John Cleese in this movie - talk about great casting! Overall this is better than the original and it surprises me that more people don't actually know about it. As a nice little family adventure film it's pretty entertaining and in terms of animation it represents everything Don Bluth is known for.

However, Bob Wylie, a referred patient with extreme anxieties who is convinced Dr Marvin is the only man who can help him, follows him on vacation and simultaneously ruins Dr Marvin's holiday and hits it off with his family.This is basically a one-joke movie - Dr Marvin can't get rid of Bob (The man is human crazy glue !) - but it's such a funny idea, it's beautifully made and it features a terrific pair of nutty performances from Dreyfuss and Murray. There's a tremendous rhythm to the movie too; Dr Marvin starts out well-balanced and gradually goes insane, while Bob starts out bonkers and gradually becomes normal. Murray as Bob has the flashier role, full of body twitches and quirks, with his eyes cast down like a child's and a monotone, but Dreyfuss is the real joy of the picture for me. Dr Marvin ostensibly has everything in life; he's wealthy and he has a beautiful family and successful career, but he's really a pathetic figure, basking in his own self-importance, constantly preening, impatient and a not very good father. His descent via Bob's influence from clipped, mannered, coiffured man-about-town to cackling homicidal maniac is a hilarious gem of a performance. The direction is first-rate, and the movie features great location photography by Michael Ballhaus and a very enjoyable light score by Miles Goodman. A tremendous black comedy about how people, more than anything else, can drive you crazy.
