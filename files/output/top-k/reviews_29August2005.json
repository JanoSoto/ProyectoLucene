[{"date":"29 August 2005","score":"","review":" Meg Ryan is Kathleen Kelly the owner of a small bookstore. Tom Hanks is Joe Fox the son of the owner of a huge mega-bookstore which moves into the neighborhood and threatens her little bookstore. They make contact on the internet but she doesn't know her true identity and she doesn't know his.This is supposed to be a romantic comedy in the vein of Sleepless in Seattle but Hank's character is not likable. Why would Meg Ryan fall for him when she hates everything he represents? The story just doesn't ring true. I didn't like this movie much for that reason.Meg Ryan is just getting too old to play these parts any longer. She certainly has been cute in previous movies but now her wrinkles are showing.Tom Hanks is just too good an actor to play these slight roles anymore. He seems to sleepwalk through the movie and his heart just doesn't seem in it.Instead of this movie I'd recommend Must Love Dogs with John Cusack and Diane Lane.

Anne Bancroft is the Mother Superior, Jane Fonda is the investigating psychiatrist (every movie should have one), and Meg Tilly is the enchanting yet frustrating nun whom nobody can budge with common sense. Adapted from the kind of stage-play that doesn't go over well in high schools, Agnes of God (terrible title!) is sort of the flip-side to Rosemary's Baby, an unsettling, overwrought exercise for thespians to display their range. What's amazing is that these actresses carve out interesting characterizations within the hoked-up, hysterical scenario. They can't possibly believe these goings-on, but they give it conviction, particularly Fonda, sterling as usual. Bancroft shines in one particular scene, again hoked-up, where she sneaks a cigarette; it's a cliché, but it's the relief the picture needs. Tilly is aggravatingly bright and beguiling. By the third act, the film has pretty much self-destructed, yet there's not much satisfaction in the answers given to us. **1\/2 from **** ","genre":null},{"date":"29 August 2005","score":"15 out of 28 people found the following review useful","review":" Young nun in a convent, so enamored with her Savior that she seems to be in a lovestruck daze, may or may not have killed an infant.
