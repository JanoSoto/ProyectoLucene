The amount of people who saw this movie and loved it makes me worry about the state of humanity.I saw this movie because some of my so called friends were saying how excellent this movie was ( I have seriously questioned my friendships with these people after this disaster!!!) and to say it was rubbish is an understatement.Keanu Reeves who plays the 'hero' role, is one of the most wooden actor's and in this movie he just plays Ted from Bill and Ted but in leather!! Thats not to say that I do not like Bill and Ted as I enjoyed both of them. But to have Reeves playing him in every film is a bit much.The story is boring and all the acting is poor. Why did they bother with this movie. If I wanted to watch a truly great sci-fi movie I would watch any of the Star Wars films.When watching this movie I broke into a cold sweat and started uncontrollably shivering - The film had made me ill. After sitting through it, I had to bleach my DVD player to get rid of the foul stench of rubbish.

Johnny Depp is one of my all time favorite actors and always will be, but this is the one movie he should not have been in. Yes he has played the role of a drug dealer before but this one was awful. Usually when he plays a character, the character actually comes to life, but this one however did not. I have not seen the movie Blow but I bet its probably a hole lot better than this one. Some parts were funny I will admit but I could not even finish watching the movie, it was so stupid. Johnny you are my favorite actor but how could you have done a movie like this??? I love you anyways. ","genre":null},{"date":"4 March 2005","score":"3 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" OH MY GOD!!!! This movie sucked so bad.

About 5 minutes in the film he is lying in bed, nothing but bad relationships, nothing but a bad history and the last word he utters to his mum is bitch.However, after the argument with his mother he takes his medicine, which stops him from walking around at night he sleeps like a baby in bed.Then he is killed by a fallen object. And in the pico seconds before he dies he invents the rest of the movie - a good relationship with his family - he even chuckles and have a drink with his father agreeing that everybody else are bastards (something that would never happen in Donnie Real Life) - and all in all, the whole world focuses in on Donnie just before he dies. This way, his sorry little life can end with a feeling that he is giving life to other people. If he Don't die, other people will, so really he is pure chivalry.Well, just my 50 cents, i gotta know if anybody else had the same experience? Great film - uh ! Frederik Oh by the way, I have never seen a Directors Cut which was better than the original. Dunno why.

She performs on the stage, and for people with enough money, in bed too.But she falls in love with a penniless poet. Ummm...well that is the plot. Oh wait, I forget an evil duke.Baz Luhrmann, the crazy Aussie director, takes this simple plot and proceeds to hit the audience over the head with enough camera cuts, visual style and just plan Bazisms so that you are forced into feeling everything the characters feel in a way no other film maker does.Often I feel that Baz never has enough confidence to trust the audience to take the journey with him, but what what he does, only he does.From the first moment you are dragged into an amazing cinematic world where you should turn your brain off. This is not because the movie is stupid but because Baz and his film making team are going to do the thinking and feeling for you.Unique and amazing this movie uses things we are familiar with to transport us into a world that we don't really understand. A world where the can can is a notorious dance (actually women wore split crotch panties when they did this dance) and the electric light bulb was a modern wonder (people went to Moulin Rouge just to see this technological marvel...or so they told their wives).
