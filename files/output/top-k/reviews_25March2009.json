[{"date":"25 March 2009","score":"","review":" The final act in Wes Craven's thriller trilogy falls flat. The original remains one of my favorite scary movies, as it blended scares with humor in a perfect blend. The second film followed pretty closely in it's footsteps and, while it didn't improve on the formula, it didn't fail to do it's job. The third is barely suspenseful and seemed to focus more cracking jokes than slitting throats. In this final installment, a film production for STAB 3 hits a snag when cast members are being killed off in the order they die in the script.As I'd stated, the film neglects it's horror element in this run. The kills are no where near as brutal as we've seen previously and they rarely frighten. Most of the scares in the movie are just BOO moments, which run out of steam after a while. I think something else about the first two films was that the victims were people the audience could relate to teenagers and college students. The horror occurred in a small town that could've been any small town in America. Now, the events take place in Hollywood and the victims are a bunch of unsympathetic, whiny actors. I personally found that I couldn't care less about whether any of them survived. As for the major moment when the killer is revealed? I can't begin to describe how anti-climactic it truly is; the filmmakers tried to tie the killer to the very beginning of the series but I don't feel it worked.The film reunites the three major players of the franchise. Neve Campbell is Sidney Prescott, who has gone into hiding as a crisis hotline attendant when she becomes haunted by visions of her murdered mother. Campbell's character, for once, is not the center of attention in this installment, seeing as how her character really doesn't have much screen time. David Arquette and Courtney Cox-Arquette return as Dewey Riley and Gale Weathers who team with Detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) to solve the string of (not) grisly murders. One a positive note, Jamie Kennedy has a cameo to reprise his role of Randy Meeks, the horror movie geek who arrives via video-tape to give the rules of a horror trilogy. Aside from some amusing performances from Patrick Warburton and Parker Posey, the remaining cast does little to stand out.While this is easiest the least frightening of the series, it isn't a terrible movie. A good portion of the humor works and the cast does enough of a job to keep the movie somewhat entertaining. I wish the filmmakers had remembered the name of the movie to be SCREAM and lived up to it's origins, but it could've been worse. It's worth watching if for no other reason than to see it all out until the end.

While there are some significant points to this sequel ultimately it is simply an epilogue to the first film. There isn't anything wrong with that but the story in this second film is barely existent. It's just Jason going on an enormous rampage following the actual story of Part One. There are two significant things about Part 2. First of all we get the finality of Jason catching up with Alice Hardy from the first film. And secondly you have the fact that Jason Voorhees becomes the sole psycho killer for the rest of the series. Basically they simply wanted to show this fact so the story line for this installment is weak, even more weak than the usual slasher story lines. The cast is there simply to get picked off and have no personality or even the guts or style to go up against the killer. Nonetheless Friday The 13th Part 2 gives fans plenty of killer gore, plenty of Jason and that's really what it's all about. Unfortunately a sequel should be more than an epilogue especially under the pretense of serializing and Lord knows they serialized Friday the 13th.What can really be said about the cast? Much like the first installment the cast is very campy and they aren't really looking for any solid acting parts. Adrienne King returns briefly from the first film. She was terrible in the first film and proves to have learned nothing about acting in this installment. Still she doesn't last long and it's good to have the main character from the first film come back. With a background in Soap Operas Amy Steel plays free spirited Ginny in her first film role. She does okay but there is still some element of really cheesy acting to her, maybe it's the script. A gentlemen who went on to Soap Operas, John Furey plays her love interest and the male hero Paul. Honestly he barely lifts a finger and never really plays hero in any way. Still they are decent together but I think he could have been and done a lot more. Warrington Gillette takes over the role as the hulking killer Jason. He shows the strength but somehow lacks the personality that others have managed to show with emotion and body language. I would go through the rest of the cast but honestly none of them stand out one bit. They all have their roles as victims but ultimately they don't do themselves any justice.Considering this was director Steve Miner's first film, but certainly not his last, it might have taken him this film to really learn the horror genre. I think he might have struggled picking up the film where the first one left off but he gets to try it all over again for a third installment which I will review very soon. The bottom line is simple if you're willing to sit down for the entire series which any horror fan or slasher fan or Jason fan must and will do then you have to watch this installment. It isn't awful, and it is entertaining, it just isn't the best of the series but every series will have it's speed bumps and you have to watch all of them, the good and the speed bumps. Still part of a classic series with some important classic moments for Jason. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 March 2009","score":"","review":" The tagline for Friday the 13th Part 2 really says it all.

Much of that, whether or not it was meant to be originally, is funny in that very fun unintentional way that makes watching a work like this even more-so with an audience. It's got dialog that crackles with the knowledge to not take itself too seriously as a movie, and it also knows not to cheat its fans looking for its titular hero to deliver the goods. The good news is 45 years later Goldfinger is still a classic of the spy movie, if only for its cache as a trend-setter (Aston Martin, Shaken not stirred, characters like Q and Moneypenny and named like Pussy Galore).To say it also hasn't aged entirely well would also be not true. Some of the ways, matter of fact most of the ways, that James Bond kills people, or in ways that other people try to kill him, are fairly preposterous. For God sakes, a man has a killer hat and the main villain meets his demise in such an absurd way that it's impossible not to laugh at the magnitude of it. And yet at the same time that one can see the absurdity, or the cheeky one-liners (i.e. shocks a guy in the bathtub, Shocking), the action may have more lasting power and ability to draw any viewer of any age in than say the recent 007 Quantum of Solace. People can only take so much fast cutting and practically R-rated violence, but with the classic-era Bond it straddles a more particular line realistic absurdity.Matter of fact that is when the Bond movies work best, and though some of the footage and a little of the pacing keep it from not quite being a great film, it certainly can be argued as a great movie. It's got a terrifically wonderful and preposterous plot - the title character, a German elitist who has super elaborate plans with Fort Knox and even more elaborate dioramas to show off to his investors before killing them - and plenty of the same sort of gadgets; seeing a good actor like Daniel Craig with that stern-face doing real things in flashy cars is one thing, but seeing a STAR like Sean Connery flashing a grin and getting tough in his Astin Martin decked out with tricks and booby-traps is something totally different. Even the villain has some crazy tricks that stick where else will we see a plane that just happens to gas everyone on cue as happens at Fort Knox?As mentioned, some of it is quite dated, but that's also in line with the fun; the banter between Bond and Moneypenny gives enough room for a whole doctoral feminist paper, and just the name of the lead femme fatale still puts a wallop in any man's day. And extra kudos to two things Oddjob (Harold Sakata), one of the strangest and most horrific villains in any movie with his preferred lack of dialog and repetitive facial expressions, and John Barry's score which takes the energy or subtlety of a scene and takes it into unexpected territory. There's excitement, sure, but a scene where Bond is trapped at night by gunpoint and has to momentarily surrender the music goes soft and slow at just the right pitch.Goldfinger was and remains a remarkable achievement in popcorn movie-making, and even those who aren't too keen on newer Bond flicks can take a look and see how sexy and self-conscious and knowing it is of itself and its audience, and how its mostly all for the better.

I'm not sure what I was expecting, having seen only The Life Aquatic as an example of notable writer-director Noah Baumbach's work (and of course that film was written with Wes Anderson, and directed by Anderson, so I wasn't sure how much of it was Baumbach's), but nothing I read specifically about Kicking and Screaming lead me to expect what I got one of the most devastating films ever made, and one which while not on par with stuff like The Graduate formally, remains one of the very best 'where-is-my-life-going-after-college' movies ever made. It also boasts perhaps the smartest use of flashbacks in a recent American film.I was thinking this would be sort of like a Wes Anderson film but it's really more what Kevin Smith would have written circa 1994-1997 if his parents were critical thinkers instead of lower-middle-class Catholics, and if he'd been writing about students and recent college grads instead of deadbeats lounging about convenience stores and malls and comics writers involved in bizarre love triangles. Perhaps that's selling this short because as much as I am drawn to some of Smith's work he could never come close to capturing the sort of melancholy Baumbach absolutely nails with this film.The film isn't really brilliant, mostly because it is really plot-less (which wouldn't be a problem usually but read on) and especially since outside of Eric Stoltz's philosophizing bartender I found nothing particularly interesting about any of the supporting cast. The main emotional pull for me was with Grover (Josh Hamilton) and Jane (Olivia d'Abo)'s story. Jane is pretty much the ideal realization of all the odd, quirky, lovely, bizarre, pretentious, disaffected, writers I had crushes on in university and even before and after that time, and the few I was fortunate enough to date. Ideal really because she's a deeply flawed character. Outside of this core story Kicking and Screaming relies primarily on Baumbach's witty banter. The trouble is that I found few of the characters to be all that interesting outside of Grover, Jane, and Chet.Baumbach's direction initially seems primitive but every so often he surprises with a genuinely sophisticated shot. I assume he got better as he went on and that stuff like The Squid and the Whale is entirely sophisticated but he already showed a lot of promise with this film. While again I didn't find the film perfect, I connected so much with Grover and with the place in their lives that all these people are that I found the film genuinely devastating at time.

Perhaps that's selling this short because as much as I am drawn to some of Smith's work he could never come close to capturing the sort of melancholy Baumbach absolutely nails with this film.The film isn't really brilliant, mostly because it is really plot-less (which wouldn't be a problem usually but read on) and especially since outside of Eric Stoltz's philosophizing bartender I found nothing particularly interesting about any of the supporting cast. The main emotional pull for me was with Grover (Josh Hamilton) and Jane (Olivia d'Abo)'s story. Jane is pretty much the ideal realization of all the odd, quirky, lovely, bizarre, pretentious, disaffected, writers I had crushes on in university and even before and after that time, and the few I was fortunate enough to date. Ideal really because she's a deeply flawed character. Outside of this core story Kicking and Screaming relies primarily on Baumbach's witty banter. The trouble is that I found few of the characters to be all that interesting outside of Grover, Jane, and Chet.Baumbach's direction initially seems primitive but every so often he surprises with a genuinely sophisticated shot. I assume he got better as he went on and that stuff like The Squid and the Whale is entirely sophisticated but he already showed a lot of promise with this film. While again I didn't find the film perfect, I connected so much with Grover and with the place in their lives that all these people are that I found the film genuinely devastating at time. When focusing on Jane and Grover it is absolutely phenomenal, and the final scene, I admit, almost made me cry.

At the time of its release it became the highest grossing film of all time. It then went on to spawn two sequels and three prequels, not to mention numerous spinoffs in various forms of media.The principle characters in the story are Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), an idealistic farmboy, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), a cocky starship pilot & Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), a feisty rebel and 'damsel in distress'. All have been assimilated into popular culture, as have numerous supporting characters like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader & Chewbacca. The cast is indeed a good one but objectivity is difficult at this point since the cast and characters are so inextricably linked.George Lucas's script does a fine job of creating an energetic story and populating it with memorable characters. His direction is well handled but the best aspects of the film's visuals come from the ground-breaking special effects. Sure, they may not be outstanding by today's standards but they were breath-taking at the time and for many years afterwards.In addition to the stellar visuals, the film also excelled on the aural front. The sound design by Ben Burtt masterfully brought the world and its creatures to life and resulted in a special achievement award from the Academy. And who can forget John Williams's legendary score, which, in 2005, was chosen as the greatest American film score of all time by the AFI.Simply put, this was a film that not only connected with millions of people but changed movie-making itself. As a result, it is a must for any film fan. That being said, I've only rated the film an 8 for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I feel that the trilogy is best appreciated as a whole and, secondly, the follow-up refined the characters and storytelling to such a degree that the original suffers slightly by comparison.By the way, if you've only seen the prequels (Episodes I thru III), don't let them dissuade you from seeing the original trilogy.

It was filled with too many movie clichés of the day (with one exception) and the humor wasn't very strong. Nonetheless, it was passable....enough to stick with it.

Cecil Kellaway as the magician The Great Solvani was entertaining. Kellaway was such a likable actor I don't know if I ever saw him in an unlikable role.Peggy Moran is the lone female in here, the magician's pretty daughter who you know (because it always happened) is going to for the manly serious guy of the leading twosome. In this case, that would be Dick Foran as Steve Banning.George Zucco looked pretty convincing as the bad guy. He was the most interesting guy in the film. His demise in this movie came as a shock - one of the few times I've seen any classic-era film go completely against the usual. The goofy Babe had a gun on him and threatened to shoot the villain at point-blank range with the standard, Three.....two.....one....and then - to my utter surprise - bam, he actually shot the guy! The villain went tumbling down some long stairs, apologized to his god, and died. It was amazing, and totally unexpected. The villain, I don't think, was even armed.Well, at least the film will be memorable for if, for nothing else, that one scene.

Most of us are used to see Hitchcock in a scene of his films but there is an unusual scene in which Hitchcock appears in a photograph that contains graduation ball of the students.According to the story, Tony is married to a famous writer who is Margot but he thinks she cheats him with another writer Mark who come for her from America regularly so Mark is right about his doubts. Because of all these matters he makes a plan upon murdering Margot by a man. This man is previously convicted and followed by Tony.Tony explains the plan to the man who should come into the house about at 1100 PM and he is wanted to wait Mark's telephone from party to Margot. Dial M is the sign of this murder trial in which M letter appears in the phone while Tony calls her. As an important part of plan, Mark say the place of the key which is placed under the carpet of the stairs against flat door. But the plan doesn't work and Margot kills his future murderer with a scissors stroke. The key that isn't found in the pocket of the man make the inspectors get confused because how he open the door is a big mystery due to absence of any stroke of windows or door.

One of the letters that Mark wrote to her was previously captured by Tony but nor Margot neither Mark knows this one was captured by Tony.

She feels like she needs an occasional escape from her stale marriage (to a stoner, painter and decorator hubby played by John C. Reilly), she rots away in her menial store job and she remembers that she used to dream of so much more. So it's a case of exceptional timing when she connects with Holden (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), a young man working the tills who picked his name from The Catcher In The Rye and writes many stories with the same, tragic themes. A friendship develops into a little more and then the minor mistakes lead to bigger mistakes and before she can get to grasp any remaining sane strand in her life, Justine finds things unravelling far too quickly for her own good.Written by Mike White and directed by Miguel Arteta (who both gave us the twisted love story of Chuck & Buck), this movie manages to mix the familiar with the familiarly edgy to provide an impressive, and rather different, little unhappy in love tale. Holden is an emotive and sensitive young man but is also shown to be quite unstable at times and, obvious to us before it becomes clearer to Justine, rather immature. The stoner hubby is not the nasty, lazy slob that we often see women running away from. He is, in fact, a loving man who unwinds after work with his friend (another good turn from Tim Blake Nelson) most days and suffers most from his own contentment which leads to thoughtlessness and taking his wife for granted.And the characters surrounding the main story strand are all enjoyable and interesting enough despite just hanging on to the very edge. White himself does very well as a security guard trying to gain newcomers to his bible study while the lovely Zooey Deschanel manages to snag all of the best moments as a majorly bored store worker who makes her own fun on the PA system and with any customers unlucky enough to be served by her.This is not a life-changing, major movie but it IS a quality piece performed by people giving some of their best work (Aniston is the revelation but Gyllenhaal also deserves credit alongside everyone else who gets some decent screen time here) and while it may not have any big WOW moments in there it doesn't leave you feeling short-changed either.

In the high-energy action-film, a special forces team, lead by Schwarzenegger, are thrust into Central America on a rescue mission. What starts out to be just another high-risk job for the crew quickly takes a turn for the worse, as the group find themselves being hunted by an alien who can blend into the environment and whom, despite all their fire-power, can't be stopped.As McTiernan's first effort (he would later go on to direct Die Hard), Predator still holds up as an effective action-flick\/monster-mash to this day. With plenty of quotable quotes from Arnie (Get to the chopper!) and a supporting group of macho-stereotypes, it's a full-on, action packed ride that doesn't let up for one minute -- logic be damned! The Predator itself -- although looking somewhat hokey by today's standards -- is an interesting and challenging villain, with a face that only a mother (or Stan Winston) could love. Before he descended upon L.A. and did battle with other Aliens in a couple of mediocre cross-over films, he was giving The Terminator himself a run for his money. Schwarzenegger is pretty much playing the action hero as only he knows best, and the final act that finds him engaging in war games with the deadly creature is among his most entertaining work. Overall, Predator hits all the right marks, with it's sense of humor, sense of camaraderie, and overall assault on the senses. If you like non-stop gun-fire, lasers that blast holes through heads and alpha-male posturing, this may be the flick for you.

From its opening, viewers are encouraged to somnambulate through Picnic at Hanging Rock believing--offered as a passage from Poe, spoken on a breeze, forewarning from a chain of wood-nymph Cassandras--what we see and what it seems could be nothing more than a dream within a dream. From that moment until the closing credits, the dream theme remains constant, with a plot that unfolds in such a way that everything is believed at face value, not a scene goes by without seeming relevant and every image is pregnant with multiple meanings; yet, nothing is ever really said at all---the plot (Victorian schoolgirls go on a picnic at a local place of natural wonder; some get lost with their teacher, some will never return--it doesn't really matter what happens; you'll care about the what but not necessarily the why) is never neatly resolved, nor is the audience told what sort of story they'd actually seen. Everything in Picnic at Hanging Rock is presented with the authority of dream logic; of course it all makes sense. To borrow from Miranda, Everything happens at the right time. Actions are accepted as is and without question, such ambiguousness lending to both cosmic significance and fundamental meaninglessness--essentially summing up Picnic at Hanging rock in one line. This film being set in the Victorian period--and the same thing that captures me about any costume film--adds an element of passed time, its wistful poignancy, immediacy. However disconnected people of the 1970's would've been from the year 1900, as time marches on, humans become further distanced from those who lived during those years. Through death of people from an era or generations, the living travel further away from the moments, places and things that were so important to those who lived--their collective consciousness, shared memories. Nomatter what happened to the girls, or how intense the situation was for the people who were part of it, that time is gone. The transience of time and how pieces of knowledge are left out of the greater puzzle, when people don't have the tools to interpret them, could be seen as two powerful themes running throughout Picnic at Hanging Rock. What did we know 110 years ago that we don't know now? In the same sense, what will humans know that same passage of time into the future? Whatever it is, it's unlikely we'll be alive to know it. Picnic at Hanging Rock implies that despite our best intentions of progress and education, we never really know either. We live in the present, our past is dead, we are yet to exist in the future; however, in the future we will, with certainty, cease to exist.The two things Victorians romanticized most, youth and death, are assigned places of honor in this story. A cold realization creeps up your spine as the film progresses; though unfortunate enough to die in youth and miss out on their own life stories, the vibrant girls at the center of Picnic at Hanging Rock would've aged and eventually died, anyway. All of these characters in context would be dead at this point in time if they'd actually existed. Every person at the search party was in for the same fate as that of the girls--whether or not it came earlier or later, swiftly or drawn; painful or not We are all going to die. By keeping ourselves busy constructing social stories, rules and customs we take our minds off the inevitable.It was also interesting to see that photos of the girls were shown often, with people responding to the pictures and assigning a sort of life to them. Throughout the film, the ugliness of death is eclipsed by romantic tragedy and the legends that spring from it--the idea of The Beautiful Tragedy as entertainment; people responding to ideals and romance--cultural or otherwise--as a way of ignoring the existential horrors and biological violence most assign to death and decomposition. In this sense, we are also reminded of the eeriness of the film medium itself, the way it taunts us with ghostlike images (sometimes of stars long dead), implying captured time and lingering souls---visual compositions of human mannerisms and personalities; an artistic distortion of past time and an attempt to capture the social essence of a living person. There is great monumental-ism to be found in being a screen star, where, as long as the medium endures in one shape or another, one can be remembered by the living and unknowingly exist as an active part of their world---people will feel some kind of emotion toward you, as you were in that moment in time.I also think it's no accident, coming from the maker of Dead Poet's Society, that the most grounded characters--the ones that manage to keep calm and evade danger--are the poorer, less educated ones. If only viewed as a commentary on isolated academia and how excessive education and social regimentation can sometimes make humans too precious for life, Picnic at Hanging Rock can be seen as a success.In my opinion, Picnic at Hanging Rock is the most effective kind of scary film; a mind-bending, atmospheric chill-inducer that disturbs us by mixing elements of natural beauty with sinister realities. A common ghost story could never hit the same chord; that sort of thing gives us hope about existing after bodily death. Picnic at Hanging Rock, however, taps into the subconscious unease that comes with being a creature aware of its own mortality; the impending doom of its own nothingness. Mortality is the alarming mystery each of us faces every day and some works of art perk us up and force us to pay attention to this ringing bell.

It surely is one hell of an experience watching it the first time, easily one of the most successful horror's of the 90s. After a second, third, fourth or even fifth viewing it doesn't have the same feeling that it did the first time. You know the twist, the ending, what's going to happen. Similar to Saw in it's own way, it still provides entertainment but not that scariness and thrills it did from the first viewing. No doubt it created a modern horror icon and was directed by a living horror legend Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street). A very suspenseful horror loaded with plenty of violence, a twist and the typical but executed well elements. All in, a great horror.

What he lied about was the names of people and motives. During his interrogation he tried to tell as little as possible and make himself out to be just a pawn in the game. But Dave Kuyan was figuring things out, and as such Verbal would have to reveal more or feign ignorance. Eg, Verbal said it was about drugs, Kuyan figured out it was to hit an informant. So all the actions from the lineup to the boat were real, and the fact that the lawyer picks Verbal\/Souze up at the end shows this.As for the twist, its a good twist, and not one that just comes out of the Blue. There are many hints throughout the movie that Verbal is more than he seems, but these are only apparent second time round. Hints include, The way Verbal shot the guy in the car despite supposedly being disabled and not being able to flick a lighter properly. The absolute first scene that shows Keaton about to die, that shows that Keaton knew who was about to kill him, the sigh and the way he says Kaizer implies he realised he got played, should of know better, and now he knows who that person really is. Other hints, Verbal emotion when he told the story he believed about Kaizer. and also when they were watching the boat he knew specifically that they were speaking Hungarian.So all in all this is a good film, the genius being that everything makes sense and there are hints throughout about Verbal.
