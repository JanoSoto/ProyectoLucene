[{"date":"11 August 2002","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Shrek is one of those kids´ movies that adults are sure to enjoy as well. Many of my friends (I´m 19) saw Shrek before me and they all said it´s very good. Now I finally decided to rent the film and watch it myself. I´m glad I did. The movie´s hilarious! Donkey, played by  Eddie Murphy, is the best character and he´s sure to make you laugh. Another great character is Lord Farquaad, played by one of my favorite actors, John Lithgow. He is such a fantastic performer, just watch The 3rd Rock From The Sun and you´ll know what I mean.        It´s no wonder that Shrek became a massive box office hit all over the world. Disney´s not the only studio that can produce good-quality family entertainment. Ice Age is another proof of that (I´ve only seen the trailer, but what a trailer that is!). Shrek actually pokes fun at many familiar Disney figures, but it´s not like Jeffrey Katzenberg is mocking them. I guess he just wanted to show his old pals at Disney that there´s a new player in the game and that´s DreakWorks & Co. Shrek, one of the best family movies out there, gets 8 out of 10.
