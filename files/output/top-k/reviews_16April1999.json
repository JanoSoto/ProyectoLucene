Self-indulgent tripe or brilliant cinema? A little of both. Billy Brown is a wholly unlikeable character, even at the end when he's all gushy about heart-shaped cookies. Christina Ricci looks drop-dead gorgeous in this film, and I always like what she does with characters, even ones as lame as this. Of course we learn nothing about Layla (I thought her name was Wendy, same as Rosanna Arquette's character? Wha?) so we don't know why she clings to this unmannered, unkempt, oily loser... she must have low self-esteem. In any event, there ARE things I like about this movie; the cinematography, the interesting use of flashbacks-in-a-box, the photo booth scene (We're the couple that doesn't touch. We're spanning time) and Ricci's very sexy dance at the bowling alley. (sort of an Eraserhead feel to that, although I don't know why exactly) Well, we obviously aren't SUPPOSED to know anything about Layla's life... but why any woman would stay with a greasy jerk who treats her like crap is beyond me. But that's true life, I guess. Some of the scenes went WAY long... like, enough already! All in all an interesting movie, to be sure. Dark, grainy, odd music, Ricci's big blue eyelids...

When I first viewed Saving Private Ryan, I enjoyed the film, but at the time I didn't really think about why. I walked out of the screening not really thinking about the film at all. First bad sign! Later on, at home, I began to think about the impact that Saving Private Ryan had on me. I started to feel as though the film had no impact on me what so ever. Second bad sign! How could this be? How could a film acclaimed by so many as one of the best war films ever made, have no effect on me? So, in a couple of days, I went and watched it again and then everything became clear. Saving Private Ryan is Steven Spielberg through and through. When I first saw the film, I had thought that Spielberg had risen above the many poor works of his past, but I was dead wrong.Steven Spielberg is a master at pulling the wool over the eyes over his momentous audience. He made many of us feel that we really needed another epic WWII film, such as what he has created. He has done the same thing with other films such as Schindler's List and Amistad. While I admire Schindler's List for its historical merits and its importance of topic, I hardly regard it as the high form of cinematic art that so many have claimed it to be. My opinion of Saving Private Ryan does not change too much from this.The film does nothing to add to the war genre. Much of it is a regeneration of older, and much better war films. Not only this, Saving Private Ryan blatantly contradicts itself. The film is obviously meant to be perceived as an anti-war film. I suspect that Spielberg would not have filmed the opening battle scene in the manner he did, if it wasn't. No doubt, most people will see this as an anti-war film, but is it really? I think not. If a film is to be truly ant-war, then there can be no redeeming qualities of war. This means that war can not be seen as heroic or patriotic. How many times was there a flash of the American flag over the entirety to the screen? I can not remember, but if it was five, then it was five too many. There is an overwhelming question in the film. Was it really worth it to go to the trouble of saving Private Ryan (Matt Damon)? Of course, in light of the fact that the majority of the Hollywood audience is intolerant of ambiguity, they answer this question. John Miller (Tom Hanks) is to be seen as an American hero for the mission that he and his squad accomplished. This does not sound like anti-war to me. In great war films like Paths of Glory and Full Metal Jacket, there are no heroes that transpire from battle at the end. There are no redeeming qualities illustrated at all. In these films, war is depicted as ugly, inhumane, alienating, and just plain wrong.The opening battle sequence which lasts for about 30 minutes is wonderful in its brutal realism and its leads us into thinking that we are about to experience a truly harrowing war picture. In fact, this is one of the best sequences that I have seen on film, and the movie is worth seeing just for the one scene. We, the audience really feel as if we are in the midst of this highly violent and bloody battle at Normandy.  The sound quality and the visuals are immaculate. The camera seems to take on a role of its own. It seems to be ducking behind objects to avoid being hit by bullets, just as the rest of the soldiers are. The entire scene is shot with the hand held camera, with jerky, and often disorienting movements, adding to the chaos of the battle.Unfortunately, the rest of Saving Private Ryan isn't as well made as this first scene. The battle scene near the end of the film feels like something out of an action movie. It has the same effect as an action sequence from one of the Die Hard movies in that it thrills us with its fast-paced shootouts and numerous explosions. I found myself not caring who was killed and who wasn't. It felt like cartoon violence. I enjoyed watching the sequence for this reason. It came no where close to having the same impact as the opening battle.While I recommend seeing Saving Private Ryan for the technical merit of the opening battle, problems continuously present themselves throughout the rest of the film. It contradicts its anti-war presence. The ending is summed up to nicely. Leaving the end more ambiguous would have been effective at least in terms of provoking thought. My strongest objection to the film is its sinking to the level of an action picture at the climax. This is not something that I wanted in a film of this scale. Saving Private Ryan leaps to a great start, but ends up not having the endurance to make it to the finish line as a winner. *** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"16 April 1999","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  One of the great things about seeing a film twice is that it allows you to go back and see the flaws that flew right on past you the first time you saw it.

Whoops - this inundation of characters is too much for the audience in the second movie as well.  Why is Sub-Zero a good guy, and where does he go?  Who the heck is Nightwolf, and why doesn't he help save Earth other than to give Liu Kang the test(s)? What purpose do characters like Jade, Sheeva, and Montaro serve other than to provide some kung fu cannon fodder?  It's like we had one good human villain (Shang Tsung) and one good F\/X villain (Prince Goro) in the first movie, so they decided, Hey, lets put in two human villains and two F\/X villains in this one.Which brings us to the F\/X.  Arrgh.  There is none of the care that obviously went into the first movie, which whatever its deficiencies, at least gave you something good to look at.  In the rush to kick out a sequel (barely two years), they obviously spent neither time or money.So MK A is mildly viewable in a martial arts\/fantasy kind of way.  The fight sequences are still good to look at. But the animated series, or the subsequent prequel of the TV series, is probably better to watch if you're looking for something entertaining.

He's turned sleaziness into an art form. So, you think he'd be the write guy for a satire on Hollywood movers and shakers. Slippery producers, wacko directors, narcissistic actors. This is Joe's world. Unfortunately, An Alan Smithee Film Burn Hollywood Burn is not exactly The Player. The script is not as clever by half. For those who don't know, Alan Smithee is the name directors use when they feel their movies have been altered or even ruined by studio intervention. They don't want their real names associated with the finished product. The joke here--and it's a small one--is that the director (Monty Python vet Eric Idle) is Alan Smithee. That's his real name. The studio isn't satisfied with the action movie he's made so they re-cut it, much to his dismay. He decides to steal the master copy and burn it. Idle is wasted in the title role. He's a caricature and, as such, someone we can't really sympathize with. That leaves us with a series of interviews with actors, producers and agents telling us, in documentary fashion, what went wrong with Smithee's film. None of them are particularly interesting. Rappers Chuck D and Coolio come off best as independent filmmakers the Brothers brothers (yet another lame joke). Ryan O'Neal is one dimensional as a slimy producer who expected the film to become another Titanic. O'Neal's inclusion should have been one tip-off that An Alan Smithee Film... would turn into a real Alan Smithee film. In fact, Arthur Hiller took his name off it. Incidentally, the film being made in An Alan Smithee Film... is a big budget thriller starring Sylvester Stallone, Whoopi Goldberg and Jackie Chan. Perhaps Eszterhas should have used that concept instead. It's hard to say who this film was made for. It's not a realistic satire of Hollywood movie makers...it's not funny...and, considering Joe's reputation, there aren't any wild sex scenes to keep us from being bored. Stick to the sleaze, Joe. It's what you do best.

It is defined and encapsulated by this striking film directed by Vittorio De Sica.  THE BICYCLE THIEF is the best of a group of films that depicted the hardship and despair that Europeans, specifically Italians, went through after the death and destruction of the war.  The economy was horrible, and the towns and cities were half-destroyed and decaying.  Rome is the location for THE BICYCLE THIEF and De Sica shoots the city in grainy black and white with non-professional actors to get a simple, yet unbearingly emotional point across.  A simple thing such as a bike can be someone's entire world at that time and losing it means doing something irrational or perhaps necessary.The lead in the film is played by Lamberto Maggiorani who seems to be a very good actor.  He is not an actor, however, and maybe this is why the film hits its mark so well and comes across so realistically.  Maggiorani is of this difficult world and his brooding face is a clear indication of this. His job is to plaster film posters up on the walls of buildings all over Rome.  He even hangs a picture that symbolizes the absolute opposite of the misery surrounding him.  Rita Hayworth from GILDA is on the walls all over the city, a sign of joy to some, a representation of their own lowly status to others.When the bicycle is actually stolen, the title character is sought after by Maggiorani and his young son (Enzo Staiola), a little kid with so much acting ability, you swear this must be a documentary.  A grueling search throughout Rome has the essential parts of the movie, because we see up close the actual people and places the neo-realist film movement came to represent.  It is a small, sad world they live in and the bike has to be found so that they can live.  The father is put to the ultimate test in front of his son.  Will he do the honorable thing or will he do what his mind and heart know is only possible? These are the tense moments of the film's climax.There is a lot of THE BICYCLE THIEF in Benigni's LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and some obvious comparisons have been drawn because of the father-son relationship. They are worthy of comparison and have equal artistic prowess.  What is different about THIEF is the level of intensity maintained throughout.  I felt the key element was the music by Alessandro Cicognini, a simple horn that plays so tragically that it is a main character in the picture.  What De Sica does here, as well as other neo-realist directors (Rossellini, Fellini), is create for American audiences a powerful counterpoint to what we are used to.  An honest, non-corporate portrait of the struggle for life and self-respect.
