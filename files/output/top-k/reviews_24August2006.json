Possession is a textbook example of the so-called love-it-or-hate-it film and there's really nothing in between! On the 1-10 weirdness scale, this movie easily gets a rating 20, as it is a non-stop series of bizarre events, demented characters and incomprehensible plot twists. If you add to that a whole lot of gore AND an attempt to stuff the film with symbolism, you get something that becomes incredibly hard to rate and masterpiece or turkey-trash purely lies in the eye of the beholder. Personally, I'm a big supporter of strange cinema (films like Sweet Movie or Santa Sangre are highly listed among my favorites), but even I thought that writer\/director Adrzej Zulawski exaggerated with the constant adding of new and always odder elements. There's absolutely nothing that makes sense here and, eventually, the story lines and sub plots begin to contradict each other and the ambitious screenplay simply becomes one giant pseudo-artistic MESS! The entire story revolves on the troubled housewife Anna who abandons her husband Mark &#150; upon his return from a very long business trip &#150; as well as her eccentric lover Heinrich with no apparent motive. Both gentlemen don't handle this rejection very well, but they eventually discover that Anna left them for a piece of homemade fungus that has its own apartment in the center of the city! Yes, fungus! Not just any type of fungus, but fungus that feeds on private detectives and their gay lovers.

Well, in case you're not, there's a lot more weirdness where this came from, but I can't possibly bring myself to list it all. If you expect at least a minimum of logic when watching films, I strongly suggest you skip Possession. It's either that or continuously asking yourself the question Why is this happening?

It's unfortunate that i'm limited to a thousand words to describe how bad it truly is. The basic plot is a character named Raymond Joshua, a rapping drug dealer played by Saul Williams, gets arrested for drug possession, then bailed out by a fellow prisoner - SERIOUSLY - then must decide whether to go back to prison. For starters the quality of the film is poor, a good twenty minutes could be cut out removing these slow motion flashbacks that are just time killers. Yes it was low budget, but many other small films don't look this ridiculous. In particular the chase seen in which Joshua picks an arbitrary point to climb up a white picket fence, despite being chased by overweight 50 something detectives that randomly burst into song, literally.The biggest problem with the movie is the unrealistic character of Joshua, amongst other problems. He is not a typical drug dealer or rapper despite whatever the poor black men have no chance message this film is going for. When asked if was guilty of the possession of the marijuana Joshua responds I mean I don't know, yet throughout the film he breaks into poems\/raps that clearly display his tremendous vocabulary, you aren't just born knowing these words. It's clear that he was well educated, yet not very educated in basic laws, or the principals of using your education to get a legal job.While in prison, Joshua breaks up a inmate riot by yelling a poem. The poem is pretty entertaining, it goes on to blame whitey for everything and his inspiring words stop everyone from stabbing each other. He then meets a female poetry teacher who happens to see the riot stopping poem, a foolish plot device an indie film fan would never forgive in another situation, but hey THIS IS REAL. In the one poetry class Joshua goes to, which is the last one due to budget cuts of course, his instructor goes on a whiny diatribe about how good the people in the prison are. This despite the previous poem by an inmate being titled I shot three mother you can guess the next word and I don't know why.A very interesting and entertaining character named Hopha, a prisoner who goes around in a lab coat for some reason, then bails Joshua out. Joshua then goes and hooks up with the poetry instructor, and has a week to decide whether accept his guilt, or flee or something. The films climax is him performing a poem to a small club that goes wild afterward. Once again the bad editing is at work here as he rattles off 20 seconds of poem, then starts over, I'm fairly sure it wasn't meant to be that way they just didn't feel like doing another take. Then a member of the audience yells an expletive that clearly should have been deleted because it makes the whole scene look ridiculous.I really worry about people being inspired by this film or wanting it shown in public schools, the latter a possible sign of the apocalypse. It seems a lot of commentary's from outside the U.S. like the film, I really hope this isn't the only vision of America you have. Film is not reality, the best it can do is present a situation that might have some truth in it, something this film does very little of. If you want a better film about prison injustice try Brubaker, it cuts to the heart of matters more and is of much better quality. I could go on about other errors in the film. A first time offender getting ten years for a small amount of weed. The screaming character Jimmy Huang who is billed high on the credits for yelling briefly, to his credit his scene is worth watching. The abundance of over and underacting. The intentional, yet not clever, cameo of Marion Berry. I could go on for hours but lets just say my rating for this film is ONE ONE ONE. . .ONE ONE ONE.

I have read many comments on this film and if I didn't know any better I would have to use the term controversial to describe Quentin Tarantino. What other word could better describe a film that receives icon status with the obligatory perfect 10 rating from a reviewer only to be followed by a bomb 1 or 2 rating. Well, I gave the movie a 9 and if someone would start a drum roll I will tell you why.Normally, I would have given this movie a perfect ten due to the fact that I never tire of watching it. If I need a laugh, throw Pulp Fiction into the DVD player because it never fails to deliver. However, I had to go way back to 1994 to remember why I have to give it a nine. Pulp Fiction almost lost me when I watched it the first time. I described the movie in 1994 as very slow in the beginning, but stick with it and it all pays off. I use the term lost me because it best describes the art form that I most love and even perform on a regular basis.I am a stand up comedian. You may be saying so what? Well when you watch this movie from my point of view, then you might appreciate it for what it is(which I will get to in a moment if I don't lose you). Stand-up comedy if not for the faint of heart. Unless you are a well known commodity(Chris Rock, George Carlin), audiences will not give you time of day. If you don't grab their attention in the first thirty seconds, then you have probably lost them for good. It doesn't matter if the rest of your act would make the warden from Shawshank Redemption roll over in his chair barely able to breathe from laughter, its a lost cause. Well, the first time I saw Pulp Fiction, the film was about ten seconds from losing me in the first 45 minutes. Now that I have developed an appreciation for the movie, it never comes close to losing me as I am watching a masterpiece unfold. The problem with people who give this movie a 1 is that they take filmwatching too seriously. Pulp Fiction is not Citizen Kane. Surprise!! Pulp Fiction did not want to be Citizen Kane. Not every movie is made with the intention of making you look deep into your own soul to discover the meaning of life. There is nothing wrong with movies that have a profound positive impact on people. Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie of all time and I admit that it always brings a tear to my eye. There is nothing wrong with movies that teach you something about people of a different era or race. I love The Color Purple and Driving Miss Daisy.I would give all three of the above mentioned films a 10(Shawshank, Color Purple, Driving Miss Daisy). I know some of the people who have coined Pulp Fiction with terms like i worry about the world I live in when I see people rating this trash a ten are probably thinking that I must be bi-polar.However, when you look at these four films as a whole, there are many recurring themes. Rape occurs in most of the above mentioned films and all the films have racial overtones. So if these classics have so much in common, then why such a disparity in the way these films are graded? Pulp Fiction isn't trying to say that rape is cool. Tarantino is simply taking a very dramatic experience and finding a way to derive some humor from it. Often, the best laughs come unexpectedly and for a comedian like me not to see the punchline coming from a mile away is very much appreciated. You must admit that Tarantino has some filming courage. I can only imagine the crew on the set of Pulp Fiction during the car scene. To have blood and human brains splattered across the car while listening to Tarantino asking Samuel Jackson and Travolta to be funny with the dialog must have been hilarious. Only a very skilled filmmaker could make the following quote funny. What now? Let me tell you what now. I'ma call a coupla hard, pipe-hittin' n-word, who'll go to work on the homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch. You hear me talking', hillbilly boy? I ain't through with you by a damn sight. I'ma get medieval on your ass. Very few people could read that dialogue and make it funny. I'll close with this. . Just loosen up a bit and watch the movie with lowered expectations. Criminals do have everyday conversations. They don't just talk about killing people all day. In fact they probably don't discuss it much at all. Didn't you learn anything from The Godfather or Goodfellas? Its always take care of that thing with that short guy from the south. That is the point that Tarantino is trying to establish in the opening scenes with the whole Royal with cheese dialogue that people whine about so much. Once you loosen up and realize that this isn't one of those groundbreaking films that teaches us values blah blah blah....then you might see that Pulp Fiction isn't that different than some of your favorites. Most of the classic films tackle issues like rape, racism, and violence. The difference between Pulp Fiction and the other classics is that sensitive issues are dealt with in comedic fashion rather than the standard dramatic flair that most of us are use to. Psychologist always recommend humor to break the ice prior to dealing with sensitive issues. So think about that before you throw a one out of ten grade to a film that obviously deserves better.

Well, I gave the movie a 9 and if someone would start a drum roll I will tell you why.Normally, I would have given this movie a perfect ten due to the fact that I never tire of watching it. If I need a laugh, throw Pulp Fiction into the DVD player because it never fails to deliver. However, I had to go way back to 1994 to remember why I have to give it a nine. Pulp Fiction almost lost me when I watched it the first time. I described the movie in 1994 as very slow in the beginning, but stick with it and it all pays off. I use the term lost me because it best describes the art form that I most love and even perform on a regular basis.I am a stand up comedian. You may be saying so what? Well when you watch this movie from my point of view, then you might appreciate it for what it is(which I will get to in a moment if I don't lose you). Stand-up comedy if not for the faint of heart. Unless you are a well known commodity(Chris Rock, George Carlin), audiences will not give you time of day. If you don't grab their attention in the first thirty seconds, then you have probably lost them for good. It doesn't matter if the rest of your act would make the warden from Shawshank Redemption roll over in his chair barely able to breathe from laughter, its a lost cause. Well, the first time I saw Pulp Fiction, the film was about ten seconds from losing me in the first 45 minutes. Now that I have developed an appreciation for the movie, it never comes close to losing me as I am watching a masterpiece unfold. The problem with people who give this movie a 1 is that they take filmwatching too seriously. Pulp Fiction is not Citizen Kane. Surprise!! Pulp Fiction did not want to be Citizen Kane. Not every movie is made with the intention of making you look deep into your own soul to discover the meaning of life. There is nothing wrong with movies that have a profound positive impact on people. Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie of all time and I admit that it always brings a tear to my eye. There is nothing wrong with movies that teach you something about people of a different era or race. I love The Color Purple and Driving Miss Daisy.I would give all three of the above mentioned films a 10(Shawshank, Color Purple, Driving Miss Daisy). I know some of the people who have coined Pulp Fiction with terms like i worry about the world I live in when I see people rating this trash a ten are probably thinking that I must be bi-polar.However, when you look at these four films as a whole, there are many recurring themes. Rape occurs in most of the above mentioned films and all the films have racial overtones. So if these classics have so much in common, then why such a disparity in the way these films are graded? Pulp Fiction isn't trying to say that rape is cool. Tarantino is simply taking a very dramatic experience and finding a way to derive some humor from it. Often, the best laughs come unexpectedly and for a comedian like me not to see the punchline coming from a mile away is very much appreciated. You must admit that Tarantino has some filming courage. I can only imagine the crew on the set of Pulp Fiction during the car scene. To have blood and human brains splattered across the car while listening to Tarantino asking Samuel Jackson and Travolta to be funny with the dialog must have been hilarious. Only a very skilled filmmaker could make the following quote funny. What now? Let me tell you what now. I'ma call a coupla hard, pipe-hittin' n-word, who'll go to work on the homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch. You hear me talking', hillbilly boy? I ain't through with you by a damn sight. I'ma get medieval on your ass. Very few people could read that dialogue and make it funny. I'll close with this. . Just loosen up a bit and watch the movie with lowered expectations. Criminals do have everyday conversations. They don't just talk about killing people all day. In fact they probably don't discuss it much at all. Didn't you learn anything from The Godfather or Goodfellas? Its always take care of that thing with that short guy from the south. That is the point that Tarantino is trying to establish in the opening scenes with the whole Royal with cheese dialogue that people whine about so much. Once you loosen up and realize that this isn't one of those groundbreaking films that teaches us values blah blah blah....then you might see that Pulp Fiction isn't that different than some of your favorites. Most of the classic films tackle issues like rape, racism, and violence. The difference between Pulp Fiction and the other classics is that sensitive issues are dealt with in comedic fashion rather than the standard dramatic flair that most of us are use to. Psychologist always recommend humor to break the ice prior to dealing with sensitive issues. So think about that before you throw a one out of ten grade to a film that obviously deserves better.

It tackles the issues of female abuse in the military, corruptness of military officials, and ultimately betrayal between father and daughter. Unfortunately these themes have been explored to death in many other films, and this film does little to improve on the subject matter.John Travolta, a cocky but smart military cop with an extreme dislike for authoritative figures, leads an investigation into the death of a female military officer. As events unfold, he finds out that things aren't what they seem (what a surprise!) and that a massive cover-up has been put in place by the woman's father, a general in army, about the fact that she was gang-raped 7 years ago.The rape scene is brutal and powerful and you will land up hating all military people, which is exactly the reason why her father tried to cover up her rape. It is completely implausible that a father would cover up his own daughters brutal rape to avoid, what is ultimately, bad press.Travolta is favourite of mine but he plays his character too tongue-in-cheek, considering the subject matter. Although he is extremely entertaining, I get the feeling that he plays it lightly because he's not able to play the roles seriously. He's just not a dramatic actor and I kept waiting for him to say stuff like cool baby.James Woods, a powerhouse actor if given the right opportunity, is unfortunately given a small role, although crucial to the plot. The witty remarks between him and Travolta are really what make this film worth watching.The ultimate baddie in this film is the general, played by the same actor that played the corrupt police captain in L.A Confidential. They're basically the same type of characters...corrupt and powerful. For me this was a give-away as soon as I saw him because he always plays the bad guy. Is there a more type-casted actor? He's also not particularly a powerful actor, nor was his character interesting. They could have made him a lot more intimidating...like Jack Nicholson's character in A Few Good Men. At the end you're just not sure if he was a good father who made a bad decision or a corrupt general who made a good decision.There are many characters and scenes in this move that have no real purpose. The fight scene in the beginning of the movie when Travolta is attacked by some guy that he's been investigating is not necessary. Travolta just laughs at the situation, makes a few witty remarks and leaves. The general's loyal assistant who helps him cover up the rape. has no input to the movie or storyline. The ultimate no-needer is Madeleine Stowe's character. She seems to exist just to give male viewers something to look at other than guys in army uniforms. Her character has no depth nor enough lines in the movie. Everything she uncovers could have been done by Travolta's character. The film is engaging although disappointing in the end. In the last few minutes, Travolta's character threatens to court-martial the general and following a few witty remarks, the general leaves. I can't help thinking that the movie should have centred around the court-martial instead of the actual crimes. It would have made a much bigger impact as a court-room drama then as a second-rate criminal investigation. It just feels like another episode of CSI Miami.It's watchable only because of the A-list cast, also including Madeleine Stowe and Timothy Hutton.

I loved every line of dialog from him, and I just highly recommend seeing any movie with him in it. The saddest thing is this is only one of two movies that I know of he fights in. The other is Rising Sun, which quite frankly shouldn't exist because it has too much awesomeness. Connery, Snipes, and Tsung. I need say no more. The rest of this movie is awesome too. Robin Shou is a damn good martial artist and I like what he brought to the character of Liu Kang. I wish the video games would have retconned to conform more to this continuity. Johnny Cage too. This movie really defined his character better than any of hte games ever did, and his romance with Sonya should have been incorporated. The sequel to this was the most disappointing thing ever, but man it could have been good. They just set this thing up perfectly and BAM they ruined it with devastation. I heard they're making a third movie. That would be sick. Tsung needs to get resurrected baddddd. as to my summary, I am advocating that Elektra 2 should be little more than Shang Tsung versus General Zod, and I believe Mortal Kombat 3 should include this as well. Watch Elektra He wears the exacty same costume as Tsung from the video game! This movie is great, and with a proper sequel it will be elevated to the level of undisputed best video game movie ever.

I loved every line of dialog from him, and I just highly recommend seeing any movie with him in it. The saddest thing is this is only one of two movies that I know of he fights in. The other is Rising Sun, which quite frankly shouldn't exist because it has too much awesomeness. Connery, Snipes, and Tsung. I need say no more. The rest of this movie is awesome too. Robin Shou is a damn good martial artist and I like what he brought to the character of Liu Kang. I wish the video games would have retconned to conform more to this continuity. Johnny Cage too. This movie really defined his character better than any of hte games ever did, and his romance with Sonya should have been incorporated. The sequel to this was the most disappointing thing ever, but man it could have been good. They just set this thing up perfectly and BAM they ruined it with devastation. I heard they're making a third movie. That would be sick. Tsung needs to get resurrected baddddd. as to my summary, I am advocating that Elektra 2 should be little more than Shang Tsung versus General Zod, and I believe Mortal Kombat 3 should include this as well. Watch Elektra He wears the exacty same costume as Tsung from the video game! This movie is great, and with a proper sequel it will be elevated to the level of undisputed best video game movie ever. Bring it on Zod, bring it on!

Allen is often portrayed in the media and by critics as an albatross of Hollywood, and I really don't have a lot of experience with his films. Besides Bananas, I have only seen Match Point, which is one of the best films I've ever seen. Being made in 1971, Bananas touches on the activism culture of the time, and the USA's involvement in South American politics. Focused around the the fictitious country of San Marcos, presumably any number of nation-states the USA was involved in destroying. It opens with the president of San Marcos being assassinated and a general taking the reigns of power in the country.Good afternoon. Wide World of Sports is in the republic of San Marcos where we are going to bring you a live on the spot assassination. They're going to kill the president of this lovely Latin American country and replace him with a military dictatorship.A strong-handed dictator, a group of (apparently marxist) rebels ban together in opposition. Woody Allen's character is living in the States and falls in love with an activist who is looking for support of the people of San Marcos. They make plans together to fly down there in a show of solidarity, but his girlfriend breaks up with him (in one of the most humorous moments of dialog recorded on film). Because he already had plans to go, he visits San Marcos where he is unwittingly joined to the rebel cause.This is a very funny movie, especially is you are a fan of Groucho Marx - Allen's influence is quite obvious through lines such as, I object, your honor! This trial is a travesty. It's a travesty of a mockery of a sham of a mockery of a travesty of two mockeries of a sham. But Woody also brings his own spin, which is pretty political - You cannot bash in the head of an American citizen without written permission from the State Department. Most of it is one-liners or character comedy, but there are also cleverly composed dialog sequences and wacky settings. The film making is somewhat weak, and the musical score is odd, but this is about on par with early 70s movies. The story was flimsy, but apparently most of the movie was filmed improv. It is definitely worth a watch if only for the last scene alone.

After the German Wehrmacht suffered a disastrous defeat at Stalingrad earlier in the year the Red Army then launched a massive 500 mile offensive along the souther sector of the Eastern Front. One of it's main objective is to recaptured the Crimea and Taman Peninsulas and it's there where the movie Cross of Iron takes place.Sgt. Steiner, James Coburn, had been out on reconnaissance with his platoon and during a fire fight with the Soviet troops he captures a young Russian boy that later, instead of having him shot, not only spears his life but escorts the kid back to the Russian lines. Sgt. Seiner expecting that he'll be taken back by his comrades in the Red Army the boy soldier is instead machine gunned by the Reds before he could reached their trenches. This is how war is depicted in Sam Peckinpah's classic Cross of Iron cold impersonal and deadly where in the end there's no winners but only losers on both sides of the battle-line.Undoubtaly the most shocking and effective anti, or even pro, war film ever made this side of All Quite on the Western Front Cross of Iron shows what war is really all about and how it effects by almost totally dehumanizing the men who participate in it. Taking over Steiner's company is an arrogant and pompous Prussian aristocratic jerk Capt.Humptmann Stransky, Maximilian Schell. Capt. Stransky wanted a transfer from his cushy assignment in occupied France to the bloody and hell-fire Eastern Front so he can earn himself the coveted Iron Cross. We see right away that Stransky and Steiner don't at all care for each other since in Stiner's case he already has earned an Iron Cross and is anything but overjoyed by it. Referring to the Iron Cross Sgt. Steiner says that it's just a worthless piece of medal but Capt. Stransky is so obsessed by the German war decoration that he goes so far as to blackmail one of his men Let. Triebig, Roger Fritz, to falsify a sworn statement, which Sgt. Steiner refuses to do, to testify to his courage in battle. During one of the many battles that Steiner & Stransky participated in a Let. Meier, Igor Galo, lead a counter-attack against the attacking Reds, which cost Meier's life, repulsing and thus keeping the Russians from overrunning his infantry company's defensive positions. Stransky was hiding in his bunker during the entire Russian assault. After the dust cleared Stransky tried to get the credit that the dead Let. Meier earned by telling his superior Col. Brandt, James Mason, that it was he, Captain Stransky, who manned the guns and passed out the ammunition during he fighting not Meier. It's later when Steiner is wounded in action and hospitalized, for a severe concussion, that Capt. Stansky's orders from Col. Brandt to receive an Iron Cross is just about finalized. Yet the very fact that Steiner is still alive and not willing to go along with the ridicules sham of Strasky being a war hero, which he's not, that leads that low-life Prussian swine to do everything in his power to not only get Steiner but his entire platoon killed in a sick act of revenge and cover-up.Great study of how war brings the worst, as well as best, out in people. With a heroic but disenchanted Sgt. Steiner not only fighting the enemy Red Army but his own superiors. With the only thing he cares about, and is willing to give his life up for, is the men in his platoon. In the end even Sgt. Steiner's platoon, by then reduced to only two men, has no attachment to him anymore. Steiner leaves it and goes after the hated Stransky who was responsible for having it mowed down. When the platoon,together with Sgt.Steiner,tried to make it's way back to the main German lines. Caught in no-mans land in a vicious cross-fire between the Red Army and fellow German troops ,under the command of Stransky's boot-licking lackey Let. Triebig, Steiner's platoon was wiped out almost to the last man. Triebig's own men couldn't continue, when they realized that they were shooting on their fellow German soldiers, to keep firing on Steiner's platoon with a totally outraged Steiner jumping into the trenches where Let. Triebig was trying to make a run for it. Cornering the rat after the gutless coward pleaded for his life telling Steiner that he was only following, Capt Stransky's, order. Sgt. Steiner then blasted Triebig to bits and pieces reloading his machine gun at least once as he kept pumping away. It's now left for Sgt. Steiner to come face to face with Capt. Stransky and make him answer for what he did to him and his men in his selfish quest for the Iron Cross. A medal that he planned to get at the expense of the lives of men who were far more qualified to get it then he'll ever be.A once in a lifetime movie about war and the courage cowardice and self-sacrifice that comes along with it. An outstanding cast headed by James Coburn and Maximilian Schell leaves it's audience with a real insight of what war is really all about. As well as a unique experience of how men, and women, are changed forever by both living and suffering through it.

After the German Wehrmacht suffered a disastrous defeat at Stalingrad earlier in the year the Red Army then launched a massive 500 mile offensive along the souther sector of the Eastern Front. One of it's main objective is to recaptured the Crimea and Taman Peninsulas and it's there where the movie Cross of Iron takes place.Sgt. Steiner, James Coburn, had been out on reconnaissance with his platoon and during a fire fight with the Soviet troops he captures a young Russian boy that later, instead of having him shot, not only spears his life but escorts the kid back to the Russian lines. Sgt. Seiner expecting that he'll be taken back by his comrades in the Red Army the boy soldier is instead machine gunned by the Reds before he could reached their trenches. This is how war is depicted in Sam Peckinpah's classic Cross of Iron cold impersonal and deadly where in the end there's no winners but only losers on both sides of the battle-line.Undoubtaly the most shocking and effective anti, or even pro, war film ever made this side of All Quite on the Western Front Cross of Iron shows what war is really all about and how it effects by almost totally dehumanizing the men who participate in it. Taking over Steiner's company is an arrogant and pompous Prussian aristocratic jerk Capt.Humptmann Stransky, Maximilian Schell. Capt. Stransky wanted a transfer from his cushy assignment in occupied France to the bloody and hell-fire Eastern Front so he can earn himself the coveted Iron Cross. We see right away that Stransky and Steiner don't at all care for each other since in Stiner's case he already has earned an Iron Cross and is anything but overjoyed by it. Referring to the Iron Cross Sgt. Steiner says that it's just a worthless piece of medal but Capt. Stransky is so obsessed by the German war decoration that he goes so far as to blackmail one of his men Let. Triebig, Roger Fritz, to falsify a sworn statement, which Sgt. Steiner refuses to do, to testify to his courage in battle. During one of the many battles that Steiner & Stransky participated in a Let. Meier, Igor Galo, lead a counter-attack against the attacking Reds, which cost Meier's life, repulsing and thus keeping the Russians from overrunning his infantry company's defensive positions. Stransky was hiding in his bunker during the entire Russian assault. After the dust cleared Stransky tried to get the credit that the dead Let. Meier earned by telling his superior Col. Brandt, James Mason, that it was he, Captain Stransky, who manned the guns and passed out the ammunition during he fighting not Meier. It's later when Steiner is wounded in action and hospitalized, for a severe concussion, that Capt. Stansky's orders from Col. Brandt to receive an Iron Cross is just about finalized.

Why it's great, in fact.CINEMATOGRAPHY Shots were beautifully colored in this film. Australia was bright and cheery. The Southwest's red land contrasts beautifully with the blue sky. The red-tainted Outback is that much better in the midst of a blood-red sunset. Biocyte's lab is a visual monotone of cool colors, which later pose a stark difference to sparks and explosions. MI 2 had beautiful cinematography.PLOT I really don't follow why so many claim the plot is bad. It's certainly not as convoluted as the first, but I think that that's for the better. People speak of plot holes, but I didn't see any (nothing major, anyway). The premise was certainly more intelligent than, say, Die Hard (yippy-kay-yay, let's go kill all the motherfu**ers). It's not Syriana, but hey.ACTING There seems to be a rule in action movies that actors can't act. Now, performances weren't quite Oscar-worthy here, but this movie was really an exception to that rule. Dougray was menacing, a truly great villain. I don't think Cruise has ever let me down in the acting department. Thandie Newton was GREAT in that she wasn't the female just thrown in for the love story; she was a real person, darnit!, and she had emotions and facial expressions and wasn't just there to have sex! I mean, some have called the acting wooden, but I'll take this over Vin Diesel's monotone expression in xXx any day.DIRECTION\/EDITING Very well done. MI 2 doesn't suffer from quick cuts like so many other modern action films do. It succeeds brilliantly in its camera-work, allowing us to always understand what's going on, and giving us some very eye-pleasing shots in the process. Scenes inter-cut with each other (Cruise going into Biocyte\/Ambrose explaining what he'll do, Cruise in motorcycle chase\/Newton on bluff, etc.) were done not only so they wouldn't subtract from each other, but so that they complement each other and give us the bigger picture in a very well-done way.SCORE Yay for Hans Zimmer! Along with what many deem a genre change (btw, many seem to have a problem with this. I personally don't, and if you do, I'd simply ask you to go along with it. If you still disapprove, well, sorry.), Zimmer changed the theme from a more spyish tune to a much more actionesque theme that perfectly reflected the mood and genre of MI 2. Also, Injection, the song played at the end of Biocyte Infiltration when Cruise jumps out of the building, is my favorite action song. It's a beautiful song, with vocals, strings, a drum, and if I'm not mistaken, some synth, too. It's a very deep song, perfect for a stylistic action scene that ended up being Biocyte Infiltration. It's doesn't bang you over the head with I'M HEAVY-METAL ACTION MUSIC!!! but is a soothing, ear-pleasing piece of art (yes, ART!), that adds emotion when needed, suspense when needed, and complements what is being shown PERFECTLY. Yay for Hans Zimmer.ACTION (ACTION!) Action is undoubtedly this film's biggest selling point. Some call it over-the-top, and it is, but it's nowhere near as bad as something like xXx. Also, everything shown is, though very improbable, at least possible (you've beaten out a lot of action movies, now, already). On top of that, it was AMAZING! Slo-mo when needed to add stylistic depth to Cruise running through a shot-up corridor towards an anonymous light source of hope as sparks soar through the air; a knife driving down atop Cruise's face, stopping abruptly mere MILLIMETERS from his eye (and, btw, this was done w\/ Cruise for real; no special effects); Cruise lifting the rear end of his motorcycle up as a car hood passes underneath it, swinging his pistol around to shoot the gas tank of the previously mentioned car until it blows up and rolls very eye-pleasingly, etc, etc. (Actually, I think myth busters proved you can't blow up a car by shooting its gas tank, so I'll give you that; still, its a very minute detail and worth it for a very insane shot). This action is way up there, giving movies like The Matrix a run for their money.CONCLUSION MI 2 is done so well in so many aspects that I really don't feel it should be written off as a stupid, over-the-top action movie. I mean, how many action movies in the following six years can compare in action OR plot? I think you'd run out of films before you'd get to the end of your fingers. Even if you included every action movie before it, I'd think you'd be hard-pressed to find a large number. Certainly, MI 2 deserves more than its current 5.7 rating.

Realizing that this is a big melodrama doesn't take much thought, and director von Trier isn't shy to blatantly face this fact. Dancer in the Dark is a sort of psychology test. It asks just how long one can live in shame, and how far people will go to defend their honor.Lars von Trier doesn't hide the fact that he hates America. Unafraid to show the dark side of it, he often shows his characters isolated and withdrawn from the world, stopping at nothing to get what they want. But he doesn't do it so that it seems as though this is the only way the people are. He carefully places psychological elements in order to manipulate the characters to seem more bitter. In this case, he focuses on greed.Dancer in the Dark is about Selma Jezkova (Bjork), a Czechoslovakian woman who moves to America in 1964 to pursue her dreams of being a musical actress. However, while in America she realizes her condition she is going blind and there's nothing she can do about it. She has a son who is at huge risk of also getting the disease and to protect him, Selma slowly saves money for an operation. She does this all while going blind.I was skeptical about Bjork playing the part for a number of reasons. She doesn't look eastern European, she doesn't sound eastern European, and she certainly has never been in a large motion picture before. But then something happened, and from minute one of Bjork's presence I knew there was something about the performance that gets right down to your bones. Here is a movie that throws you in powerful emotion, and Bjork was able to pull it off. And then some.The story itself isn't very complex but it does represent how constricted a community can be, and just how hunger for power can only go so far. Like his later work, Dogville and Manderlay, von Trier simply relies on the performances to drive the movie more than anything else. He and Bjork, though often hated each other on sets, pulled off the best performance of the year, and the most emotionally charged film since Titanic. This is a movie that in my opinion was wrongfully snubbed at the Oscars for at least a Lead Actress nomination.

Even if you see error in the husband's thinking, it is clear he believes with all of his heart that he truly can love both of these women at once and you sympathize with his sincerity. The wife is easy to care for, a good mother and very devoted, and the mistress is not someone you feel compelled to hate, either. She's not out to break up this marriage and she seems to really need this love.And what makes the film endlessly interesting is in how ambiguous Varda is about her own feelings. She never leads you to pick a side, never encourages you to see one specific viewpoint or leave the film feeling a particular way about what happened. While the music (Mozart is used throughout most of the film) in the last 15 minutes would seem to suggest anger at the way things have turned out, you can also look at the early stages of the film and see the image of the idyllic family with pastoral music as too perfect a presentation, one that is not entirely believable. Varda even hints at this herself; after we've watched about five minutes of this family picnicking in the woods, she cuts almost immediately to nearly the same image in a TV advertisement, suggesting that a marriage that happy only exists in commercials to begin with.

The 1978 version in particular was just about as good as it could have been, even better than the original (in my admittedly biased opinion). Why did anybody feel the need to remake it? Maybe even a better question is, why did a studio feel that there would be enough marketable interest to bankroll what amounts to a remake of a remake? For one thing, the gamble here seems to have been to turn the original's adult protagonists into teenagers. The film really has only one teenager as its centerpiece, Marti, the daughter of a scientist working on a military base, but it gives the story a different perspective than the other films, which is a plus.Each Body Snatchers film has had its own subtext involving the alien threat. The original had a red scare political slant, the 1978 remake referenced pop psychology and satirized the whole I'm OK, You're OK movement, and this 1993 remake seems to distinguish itself with elements of political correctness. Forest Whitaker, when confronted with a pod enemy who tells him that his race has learned that the individual is less important than the entire species, Whitaker's character hisses The individual is ALWAYS important! The pod people as a metaphor for the shaping of language and culture by the whole political correctness phenomenon would have made for a very interesting idea, but this movie doesn't take it far enough in that direction. Abel Ferrara crafts it more as a straightforward horror film, with some great pod effects (other special effects, such as some blue-screen matte shots, don't fare so well). Meg Tilly is wonderful as Marti's stepmother, one of the first to get taken over by the pods, and she's genuinely creepy.We start to wonder exactly what the 'rules' are for a pod person. At one point, an unformed clone of Marti seems pretty much finished, and rises up off of its table to seduce Marti's boyfriend into not waking her up. So why is Marti fine when she's roused from sleep thereafter? At what point does the human body collapse during duplication? Additionally, why do so many of the pods seem to understand and react to emotions, when they're supposed to be emotionless? For instance, one tries to lure Marti into revealing whether she's human or not by baiting her with information about her little brother. So what's the point here? If Marti was a pod, wouldn't she have immediately suspected the pod person who baited her in the first place? Why don't they scream at each other? These inconsistencies were never that apparent in the previous versions.Despite that nitpicking, the real liabilities here are mostly all in the overly familiar material, which brings me back to the beginning...why did they remake this?
