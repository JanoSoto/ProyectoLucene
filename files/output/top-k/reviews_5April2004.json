I rate how I feel about a movie based on a combination of what my expectations are for it based on the advertising, how much they spent making it, who is in it, and how much I paid to see it.  So, a low budget clunker that I see at a $5 matinee show will get a pass over a high budget clunker that I pay full price for.  The Haunting fits into the latter category.  This is just a putrid pile of puss of a movie and I would think you would be better off in a dentist chair than sitting at home watching this film.I was sitting around a few years back watching some bad horror movie and realized that I had not seen a really frightening movie in a long time.  I was in the mood to be scared and I saw the making-of video for The Haunting on HBO.  It looked like it might be scary, with all of those menacing looking sets, so I decided to go see it that night with my wife, thinking we would be in for a scary movie.  Turns out that the whole movie was nothing but menacing looking sets, with no scares behind them at all.  In fact, my wife and I spent most of the time in the theatre laughing very loudly at the horrible plot, the inane dialogue, the misplaced special effects, and the absolutely horrid acting by Lili Taylor.  I'm not sure what else she has been in, but based on her performance in this film I would never watch any of her other movies.  I literally laughed every time she said Hugh Crane or whatever the ghosts name was.  She acted the way a little kid would on the playground if they were playing The Haunting.By far, the thing that ticked me off the most in the movie was the menacing sets.  It felt like they were setting you up the entire movie for something really scary to happen in one of these ominous rooms, but nothing ever happened.  They spent an hour showing off the mansion and how weird it was, but nothing happened.  A great example was the mirrored-room with the carousel.  They went in there in the beginning and I thought something would happened.  It conjured up images of Something Wicked This Way Comes, so I thought OK, something weird has to happen in here.  When they finally go back there, all that happens is that Nell sees herself in the mirror looking pregnant or something.  What is that?  How do you run around for two hours going oh my God, something frightening is going to happen and then nothing happens... Oh my God, the one lady got hit in the eye with a broken string form the harpsichord...ooooo I have to hide my eyes.I normally give any movie a chance, but we almost walked out of this one.  If it had not been so comical seeing these actors floundering in the muck, we would have left.  Never rent this, never buy this.  It's one big, over-budget, set-driven nightmare that stole $18.00 out of my pocket.  You want to be scared?  Watch Jeff Goldblum's performance in The Fly.  You want to laugh?  Watch The Haunting.

Robinson as Johnny Rocco--the brash, boisterous, sleazy gangster whose frailties (cowardice and a yearning for better times) gradually unfold before us.  There's Lionel Barrymore as James Temple, the delightfully feisty and crusty hotel owner overcome with revulsion at Rocco's presence.  There's Thomas Gomez, Harry Lewis, Dan Seymour and William Haade as Curly, Toots, Angel and Ralphie--Rocco's colorful but hard-edged thugs who are presences unto themselves.  There's Claire Trevor as Gaye, Rocco's declining, alcoholic moll who symbolizes more than anything how far Rocco has fallen.That's an awful lot.  Too much scenery-chewing from Bogart or Bacall would push it over the top--and director\/screenwriter\/demigod John Huston knows it.  He coaxes remarkably restrained and subtle performances out of his star couple.  The romantic tension between them is suggested but never shoved in the audience's face.

Just not by a lot.First the plot.  Attack of the Clones has a deliberate method of storytelling that I don't recall in the original trilogy.  For example, before Amidala's remark that she heard Anakin having a nightmare, the audience must first be presented with a scene showing him groaning and moaning in bed.  It's like connect-the-dots where the dots are lettered and numbered and there's a dot every centimeter.  It occasionally feels patronizing, as if Lucas assumed the audience consists of 2nd graders.And yet there were other times when I wished that Lucas had done more with certain scenes.  For example, I wished he had extended Anakin's rampage against the Sandpeople; it would've offered thrilling entertainment and even some characterization.The romance was quite hokey, and the script was generally forgettable. George Lucas knows how to make great star battles, but he knows JACK about romance, and boy does it show.  The scenes between Anakin and Padme come off as cliched and awkward.  I honestly think that Lucas should have tried a touch of of romantic comedy in the Anakin-Padme scenes.Speaking of Anakin, Hayden Christenson is a much better actor than Jake Lloyd (he'd better be).  I guess if we are to believe that a child as brilliant as Anakin would speak like a bad actor, then his stale monotone would carry over into adolescence and adulthood as well.Another problem is the timeframe.  These movies are supposed to take place one generation before the original trilogy.  Yet the sets and props look more high-tech than the value-city toys of Episode IV.  Furthermore, with all the effects they had at their disposal, I'd think they could have done SOMETHING to accommodate the bizarre aging of Anakin and Amidala.  While Portman's character appears to have aged two weeks since Episode I, Anakin has morphed from toddler into full-grown adult, and a tall one at that.Although the CGI was state of the art, it still looks inferior to live action in many respects.  It seems that in the realm of digital effects, animating a rider upon the back of a creature especially poses a challenge. In many scenes featuring riders, the movements were choppy and looked like claymation.  This was the same jerkiness I noticed in Lord of the Rings when a character jumped on top of an animated troll, and again in Harry Potter.But the biggest flaw with the new Star Wars movies is the lack of lovable characters and the chemistry between them.  In the original series, we had the wild, reckless Han Solo, the naive, idealistic, space-redneck Luke, the unwaveringly loyal, always-moaning Chewie, the serious, wise Obi-wan, the slightly snotty yet sensitive Leia, the digital bickering of the two droids, and then we had the wonderful scenes that resulted when their personalities clashed together and mixed into fun, entertaining, dramatic, memorable adventures.Now in the new series, we have Obi-Wan, who is still serious, Anakin, who is supposed to be a wildchild but comes off as forced and serious, Padme, who is generally serious, and a bunch of jedi, who are deadly serious.  You have all these characters standing around being serious, looking cool if you will, and this leaves any humor and color up to the droids, who do their best, and the slapstick antics of Jar-Jar, who thankfully is nearly absent in AoC.  The end result is poor personality development and characters who are mildly interesting, but not particularly lovable or memorable.Like Phantom, the sabre battles again were breath-taking and well-choreographed (or animated).  However, as cool as it was seeing you-know-who kick butt, it still was not executed as well as the show-down between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon\/Obi-Wan.Finally, I thought it was funny how ultimately the entire fall and corruption of the Republic can be traced to Jar Jar Binks.

I probably cannot make any statement about this film that has not already been made many times, but it really is one of the most beautiful and moving films I have ever seen.  I first read Harper Lee's lovely novel when I was a young teen, and it was one of those books that gave me an experience that changed the way I perceived the world and my own family.  The movie stays true to the wonderful, innocent prose.Every time I watch, I see my father in Atticus Finch.  He, too, is a southerner who respects people and defends his beliefs.  He also has always respected his children and treated us the way Atticus treats Scout and Jem.  I also see other family and friends in various characters in the film, because we have such strong southern roots.  Even the negative aspects of racial antipathy and loss of childish innocence bring certain memories to mind.  Those who did not grow up in the south or with southern families might not see parallels the way I do, but the movie would be a gem to anyone.  Gregory Peck put in the performance of his career, and the children acted in the least forced manner I have ever seen.

I mean there are no cinematic thunderbolts involved. It flows along, rich in atmosphere, switching about half-way through from a tourist's view of Savannian eccentrics to a rather ordinary courtroom drama.It's one of Eastwood's better movies, about at the level of, say, Bird and Play Misty For Me, although entirely different in content. One of the reasons it's as good as it is, is Bumstead's art direction. I can BELIEVE that this is Jim's or Sonny's home, so tasteful, elegant, and expensive.Another reason is the performance of Kevin Spacey, who has been good elsewhere but never better than here as the slyly cynical, secretive, supercilious Sonny. (Sorry about that.) God, he's just great. He sort of WAFTS through the first part of the movie, just barely suggesting his bisexuality, enjoying his cigars and reveling in his money and good taste. John Cusack is a reliable sort of everyman. His character, Kelso, evidently didn't exist in the book. I didn't read the book but I did catch excerpts in the New Yorker. But the character is useful here, the way any newbie is useful when we're being introduced to a relatively odd social world. As a writer sent from New York he has to have things explained to him, and they are thus explained to the viewer. The novice character is a useful shorthand expository device. Eastwood's daughter looks the part and is very attractive. Sonny's lawyer is a good ol' boy who proclaims proudly to the jury and the judge and the spectators in the courtroom that he has no idea who the writer Hobbes was, but he knows who Perry Mason was. There aren't that many places in the country where ignorance is a point of pride. He kvells he as confesses this, jes' folks, you know? I enjoyed the judge too, played by the guy who was Sonny's real trial lawyer. There are assorted people of unusual character on display. A guy who walks a dog that isn't there. Some guy surrounded by bees. A voodoo priestess. A (gasp) transvestite show girl, Lady Chablis, of whom a little goes a long way. People carry loaded guns to Christmas parties. Sonny and some others are either gay or bisexual. But they are mostly harmless clownish figures. At one point Cusack calls his editor and says, These people are really weird. New York is boring. Is he supposed to be kidding?The fact is that they actually are pretty eccentric, at least the particular social circles we get to see, but they're odd in a user-friendly way, polite, articulate, sensitive to the impression they make on an outsider, blasé about most things including murder. Sonny went and shot someone -- have some crab cakes? The thing I remember best about the excerpts from the book is the meeting of the lady's bridge club or whatever it is. It's only a snippet in the film, although an enjoyable one, what with the twittering belles all dressed in pink and white flounces and wearing broad-brimmed hats. In real life, as far as I can recall, these little luncheons could have served as a movie unto themselves. The host's door never opened until the scheduled second. The ladies knew one another and were ushered into the parlor where they chatted about circumscribed topics and were served two extremely potent drinks, so they were all smashed within an hour of their arrival. (No men allowed, of course.) They were served a light lunch after a predetermined interval and left precisely at the same time after each meeting. The whole affair was as highly ritualized as a church service.Nice use is made of locations. What we see is what might be called the aesthetic component of the community. The houses are painted in pastels and are well kept up. (There's another Savannah that we don't get to see.) Parts of Charleston look picturesque like that too. What we see in the colored cemetery isn't voodoo, at least it's not what passes for voodoo in Haiti. It might be called folk spiritualism. The cemetery is an atmospheric place though. Eastwood heightens the effect by having incense smoke drift through the tombstones. (He lapses into another cliché later, when Sonny dies. A man gets dizzy and the camera spins around in a circle.) The statue of the placid young girl, holding a scale in each hand, is a striking image. (She has since been removed for her own safety after the movie was released) The score is by Lennie Niehaus, who used to play an accomplished alto sax in Stan Kenton's band. The courtroom drama is competently done, no more than that.This is worth watching, if not worth watching too often. I could have done with less of Lady Chablis and her tootsie roll. She isn't as funny or shocking as she and Eastwood seem to think she is.

He makes Sharon Stone look masculine and very unsexy just by being in the same frame with her.  Pardon me for a moment, but... eeeeyeck! I think I need a shower now too.Two more criticisms 1) This has one of the cheesiest moments I've ever seen in an action film that's supposed to at least have high production value, if nothing else.  2) What the heck happened to the cat at the end?  He was the only character I cared about!Like I said, James Woods is the only thing this movie's got going for it. He gives a great performance as the villain.Stallone should've stayed away from trying to play macho tough guys and stuck to playing likeable underdogs with tough guy tendencies, like in Rocky and Cop Land--it's the only time he's ever been good.3\/10 stars (mostly for Woods).

That unfortunately did not turn out to be the case.

Zhang Yimou beautifully crafts this anti-Communist and pro-feminist film where the concubines are merely subjects of their master.  Vying for his attentions through various methods, the system that exists in this almost miniature Forbidden City contains red lanterns that are lit when the master comes to one of the concubines' houses within this gigantic complex.  With the lit red lanterns comes power within the household.  Chances to procreate and bear a male heir, further consolidating their role and position within the household.

It's all a very striking and realistic look at how women were treated in China back then by the mainly paternalistic society.It's quite slow, which is the main reason why I'm not enamoured with it, and nothing really happens in the movie (aside from the fact that she must compete with the other mistresses of the household, something that I've known already, considering I've watched many other Chinese films involving royal intrigue and infighting to get more power etc).  The complex is quite gray in colour, lending it an almost prison-like quality, which these women unwittingly are pretty much in.  They're not allowed to leave, and they're expected to be obedient and subservient to the master (ie warden).  It's not a masterpiece of cinema, or even of Asian cinema, but if you haven't seen stuff like that before, and you really want to get a taste of what survival of the fittest is really like, or you want a good introduction into mainland Chinese film, look no further.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"5 April 2004","score":"236 out of 284 people found the following review useful","review":" Raging Bull isn't the average, stereotypical underdog boxing movie, because it isn't really about boxing at all. Like most great movies, its focus is much deeper. It came out in 1980, earned Robert De Niro a Best Actor Academy Award, and was marked down as another solid triumph by director Martin Scorsese, whose previous 1976 outing with De Niro earned them both critical acclaim (and for De Niro, an Oscar nomination, although he would actually earn an Oscar for Raging Bull four years later).It dwindled in production hell for quite some time, with Scorsese's drug use halting production and only the duo's strong willpower that kept the project moving ahead. It was after De Niro read boxer Jake LaMotta's memoirs that he knew he wanted to make the film, so Scorsese and De Niro turned to Paul Schrader for a script. Schrader, who had previously written Taxi Driver (1976), agreed, and wrote the screenplay for them. The rest is history.Raging Bull has often been regarded as the greatest film of the 80s. To be honest, I'm not so sure about that, since various genres offer different feelings and emotions (comparing this to a comedy might seem rather silly). But to say it is one of the most powerful films of all time would be no gross overstatement -- it is superb film-making at its finest.De Niro gained 60 pounds to play LaMotta, which was an all-time record at the time (later beaten by Vincent D'Onofrio, who gained 70 pounds for Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket). His physical transformation is on-par with any great screen makeover, especially the most recent, ranging from Willem Dafoe in Shadow of the Vampire to Charlize Theron in Monster. In addition, co-star Joe Pesci also lost weight for his role of Joey, LaMotta's short, eccentric brother. The greatest scene in the film is when LaMotta accuses his brother of having an affair with his wife. The tension is raw, the dialogue amazing, and the overall intensity electrifying.The film is most often compared to Rocky, more than any other, apparently because they both concern a certain level of boxing. As much as I absolutely adore Rocky, Raging Bull is a deeper, more realistic film. But whereas Raging Bull is raw, Rocky is inspiring, and that is one of the reasons I do not think these two very different motion pictures deserve comparison, for the simple fact that they are entirely separate from one another. The only connecting thread is the apparently central theme of boxing, which is used as a theme in Rocky, and a backdrop in Raging Bull. They're entirely different motion pictures -- one uplifting, the other somewhat depressing -- and the people who try to decide which is better need to seriously re-evaluate their reasons for doing so. They both succeed splendidly well at what they are trying to do, and that's all I have to say about their so-called connection.De Niro, who could justifiably be called the greatest actor of all time, is at the top of his game here. In Taxi Driver he displayed a top-notch performance. He wasn't just playing Travis Bickle -- he was Travis Bickle. And here he is Jake LaMotta, the infamous boxer known for his abusive life style and somewhat paranoid delusions during his reign as world middleweight boxing champion, 1949 - 1951. Throughout the film, he beats his wife (played expertly and convincingly by the 19-year-old Cathy Moriarty), convinced that she is cheating on him, and that is more or less what the film is truly about. The boxing is just what he does for a living, and could be considered as a way to release some of his deeper, harbored anger.LaMotta has a close relationship with Joey, his brother, and their interaction is often what elevates the film above others of its genre. The dialogue is great, close to the perfection of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, rich in that rapid-fire filthy language and brutal insults. Pesci, who was on the verge of quitting showbiz at the time of pre-production, was spotted by De Niro in a cheap B-movie named The Death Collector (1975), a.k.a. Family Business, a truly horrid film that nevertheless showcased an early sign of things to come for Pesci. De Niro wanted him for the movie and his premonition was either very lucky or very wise -- this is one of the best performances of Pesci's entire career.Scorsese shot the film in muted black and white, portraying a certain era of depression and misery. To make the blood show up on screen during the occasional fight scenes, Scorsese used Hershey's Syrup -- which is an interesting tidbit of trivia for any aspiring film-making planning on filming a violent movie in black and white. But how often does that happen?This is certainly one of the most intense films Scorsese has directed, and one of the most important of his career. Along with Taxi Driver, it is an iconic motion picture that will stand the test of time for years and years to come. Scorsese and De Niro's partnership over the years has resulted in some of the most influential and utterly amazing motion pictures of all time Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, Goodfellas and Casino come to mind almost instantly. But perhaps the one single title that will be remembered as their most daring effort is Raging Bull, a motion picture so utterly exhilarating that it defies description. It is simply a masterpiece for the mind and senses, leaving you knocked out cold after its brutal one-two punch. If I had to assemble a list of required viewing, this would be up there towards the top.
