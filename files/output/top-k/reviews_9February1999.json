Now Sense and Sensibility had this flaw of a slow pace, but at least it had lively lines to make up for it, as well as some good performances!That brings me to flaw #2, which is of course, the acting. While I don't happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film, I am sure they are capable of good work, but I didn't see much of it in this movie. It was like people were trying too hard to be witty, too hard to be upper-class, too hard to be British (well, some of them), so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as people.#3. The cast, as I said, seemed only like actors, and not actually like the people they were playing. Maybe that's a good thing, because the people they played really weren't all that nice. Why did everybody like Emma, for example? Sure, she was nice to the rich, handsome people in front of them, but she was an awful gossip behind their backs. If her friends were ugly, then she didn't even bother to go behind their backs. So, why is this girl so great? Why do people have to tell stories, just to make her laugh? Of course the snob couldn't even do that right. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her Emma did not exactly change my opinion.Well, it's easy to see that I did not care for this one.

I had no idea that what seemed like an 'interesting' little film would end up being one of my all-time favorites.Field of Dreams is an amazing illogical, fantastic journey that never seems to be going where you think it is. Rather than get distracted in trying to figure out what is going to happen (like I often do upon first viewing), Field of Dreams is one film where I was just content to sit back in wonder waiting to find out where Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) and I were being led to.The film wastes no time with set up and supposition. If you build it he will come a strange voice whispers in the opening minutes of the film and Ray Kinsella, the Iowa farmer who is the only one who can hear the voice is just as perplexed as you are as a viewer. Without giving too much away, because of this voice Ray is led on a pilgrimage across America, that is seemingly all about baseball; but turns out to be really about something far more poignant and touching.A fine cast does an excellent job tip-toeing around the fragile confines of the story, somehow avoiding the corny or ridiculous. To a great degree what keeps Field of Dreams from becoming nothing more than an absurd excercise is that Kevin Costner makes his character so down-to-earth that he really seems like an ordinary person who has been placed in an extraordinary situation that is beyond his control or understanding.I loved Field of Dreams the first time I saw it and it has never lost it's luster in the countless times I've seen it since.

Boorman's film is much better, in so many ways, not the least the fact that the amoral violence would carry more of a kick in the late 60s.

I suppose it could have been for the actors, and Young Guns boasts a so-so cast of them Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Lou Diamond Phillips, Kiefer Sutherland, Dermot Mulroney and Casey Siemaszko. Obviously, as actors go, some are better than others(Siemaszko, Mulroney, and I suppose Sutherland outweigh the other three), and as far as the performances go, some are also better than others, with Siemaszko as the most moving and Estevez as the most miscast.I don't know what it is about Emilio Estevez's performance that bothered me so much, because usually I don't mind him, but in this one he just didn't click. For one thing, he doesn't look believable as a cowboy, he just looked like he was playing dress-up, basically. For another, he spoke in some weird faux-Southern accent and I guess I don't really like those with most actors. Either you are Southern or you aren't. He also made his voice all deep and cold, and I just don't even know how to explain it. I just didn't like him. If it's any consolation, I didn't really care for Lou Diamond Phillips either.I was somewhat more impressed with the work of Dermot Mulroney and Casey Siemaszko.

Casey Siemaszko also gave a rather good turn, which for some reason, also took me a couple of tries to really notice. While he probably plays the most ignorant of the Young Guns (and Siemaszko often gets stuck playing people who are not of high intelligence), his character has enough wit and depth to get past the dumb guy role. He also gives it a nice sensitive touch, that suggests that maybe Charley Bowdre is smarter than anybody allows him to be.But sometimes good acting just isn't enough.

As far as basis in fact goes, this movie rests on the truthful scale somewhere between Titanic and Star Wars. About the only thing Spielberg got right was the fact that there was a war going on at the time. He owes both the Niland and Sullivan families very sincere apologies for butchering what he originally claimed was their true story.I had a harder time judging this movie on a reality scale. In some ways, the movie was very gripping and realistic, but in other ways, Spielberg failed miserably. In Spielberg's WWII, there were two groups of people. The horrible, murdering Nazis, and the good ol' boys of the US. I may be biased because I currently reside in Canada, but I know that there were probably just as many Canadian (not to mention British and others) troops roaming around during WWII. I admit they did do a tolerable job on the WWII ambience, but did very poorly on creating a realistic military environment.Saving Private Ryan was a good movie, and well worth every penny it cost to see eight times in the theater (eight different groups of friends), but I wouldn't laud it as a fabulous war film, nor would I use it to teach military history, as some schools are considering doing. There were two things that really hurt the movie; 1) Spielberg's Hollywoodization of the film and his insistance on hiring over-aged big-name actors; 2) Spielberg's insistance (until recently) that Saving Private Ryan was a true story. Spielberg would have done better hiring some relatively unknowns and making clear the film was fiction. It may have just been me, but seeing Matt Damon as Private Ryan made me wish they had just left him there. Matt Damon was the Hollywood heart-throb after Good Will Hunting, and it was so obvious it was Spielberg's way of pulling in the teen crowd. I was surprised he didn't hire the DiCaprio boy.Saving Private Ryan wasn't the best film of the year, but it was by no means the worst. I recommend it to anyone over 18 who is looking for an entertaining, hard-hitting way to pass three hours. The scenes on the beach really are well done and excellently written (makes it easy to overlook the mistakes), and while the movie does drag at times, it's worth taking a look-see. I would not suggest allowing children to see this movie, because many of the scenes are highly graphical and highly disturbing. I have no plans on letting my children see this film until they're old enough to understand that film isn't reality, and that Saving Private Ryan is just as fictional as most war films (G. I. Jane, Courage Under Fire, etc). If military films are a real interest, I would suggest either adaptation of The Thin Red Line. It is more realistic than Saving Private Ryan, and as opposed to the fictional Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line has a high basis in fact.

I remember watching it on the big screen in '92 and being satisfied back then. I watched it on video recently and thought it rather embarrassing. It's main points of interest are the recurring Enya track and the incredibly committed Alice Krige whose intense presence I suspect was the reason this film came to be made at all. She's far too classy for this, her performance is from a movie for grown-ups while everybody else plays pantomime. Interesting for completists who have an urge to see for themselves cameo appearances by the likes of Stephen King and Clive Barker but in 1999 these things merely add to the embarrassment.

This is one of the hallmarks for truly successful film adaptations of books, I think.  Look at the wildly successful adaptation of _The Silence of the Lambs_ or the very close screen adaptation of Stephen King's _The Shawshank Redemption_.  When you start screwing around in a film adaptation with what made a book successful in the first place, you're asking for trouble.  Unfortunately, too few producers and directors in Hollywood seem to recognize this.What about the film?  It's a harrowing, ultimately depressing experience. But, that's a positive thing.  It's nice to see that those involved weren't pressured to give this story a happy ending.  It could not have supported one.  Bill Paxton does his usual great job, though his acting is so non-flashy, he'll probably be overlooked for any sort of recognition.  Billy Bob Thornton does a great job and his Oscar nomination is well-deserved. It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who acted in _Sling Blade_. Bridget Fonda is also memorable, as the film's dark heart, the instigator who causes most of the problems the various characters must deal with.The film is somewhat reminiscent of a harder-edged _Fargo_, set in a cold, snowy Minnesota winter, but it lacks any comedic edge.  The story looks very critically at human motives, greed, and what the average man (or woman) might be capable of, given the right circumstances.  Director Sam Raimi is also to be commended.  This is a much more restrained film than some of his other efforts, befitting its serious and somber subject matter.One of the best films of 1998.
