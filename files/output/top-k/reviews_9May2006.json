The description of primitive people and how they trained (or still train..) their children to be killers and cannibals when it comes to members of other tribes that comes before the school sequence certainly tells you what's going on. Civilization hasn't come very far. However, apologists for both the cannibal tribe and the 'war on obesity'might have to think the 'apologies' over. (unless they are hopeless) When it comes to animals..the human one is one of the really low ones, especially when it's part of a group or a tribe. Of course the scenes with the characters most reviewers call Adam and Eve do in the end suggest South Africa during the apartheid period. The police and guns and dogs. The twins..are an easy part. However, not all twins are happy to be twins. (And certain cultures view twins in very vicious tribal ways..) The sequence in the desert could give a viewer something to think about when someone comes around asking for donations for starving desert tribes who wear turbans and paint themselves blue. The tribe kills the woman, one of the twins,because she offered to stay behind while the others involved in the 'accident' drove to notify the police. A child who should not have been running alone in the desert was killed by the reckless driving of a western man incapable of much thought. He's no better than the jerks who laugh at the incident involving the blind woman's seeing eye dog earlier in the film. There too the twin tries to help and is hit at by the blind woman trying to fend off the dogs in heat and maybe their counterparts. The twin is innocent but the members of the tribe think in numbers. They are incapable of any of the nuances human beings should after all this time be capable of. The reckless driver gets off free and is happy to leave the woman behind. Her boyfriend is a little upset. Of course we don't know who played the tribe in the desert... It's a nicely cynical piece of work. Sex is the least interesting thing in the movie.

Much of the time, groundbreaking films are not particularly remarkable artistically-- they simply get by on doing something that had never been done before. NotLD is a particularly glaring exception because it is so effortlessly and organically transgressive. A film like Last House on the Left seems to exist exclusively for the purpose of pushing the audience to the edge, but NotLD never announces that it is a new, darker sort of horror film. One gets the impression that Romero and Russo and all the others didn't even specifically intend to make a more graphic horror film when they started out. It appears almost normal, initially, but moves inexorably towards the horrific conclusion, at all points defying the expectations as to who ought to survive, or whether or not bravery or cowardice ought to be rewarded. It never feels self-conscious or scripted, and that's why it holds up so well even after it is no longer a particularly morbid or gruesome film. Despite the supernatural elements, NotLD is disturbingly authentic.Horror films tend not to be to big on plot, and Night of the Living Dead is no exception. It is your standard zombie apocalypse plot, though, of course, no such thing existed at the time. Most modern zombie films take the action-horror route along with an urban setting, but NotLD is pure horror, and takes place inside a desolate farmhouse out in the Pennsylvania countryside. As the film opens we are introduced to Barbara and Johnny, brother and sister. These are characters we've seen before Barbara is snippety and uptight, and seems to be well on her way to becoming an old spinster. Johnny feels like the hero, and he'd probably feel at home in a 50's Sci-Fi or Horror flick, as he's whiny and jokey and teases his sister. Still, he seems to have a good, courageous heart, however, as he immediately comes to his sisters aid after she's assailed by a strange man in the graveyard. But Oops! Johnny gets his brains bashed in only a few minutes into the film. And though she's technically alive Barbara is more or less out for the count for the rest of the film, and mostly lounges about in a nearly catatonic stupor.Barbara flees to an apparently abandoned farm house, and we are shortly introduced to the films real hero, Ben, played by Duane Jones. The acting in the film isn't exactly terrific, but Jones is good as Ben, and helps create one of the most appealing protagonists in all film. He's smart and capable but certainly not a saint-- Notice how he decks the hysterical Barbara after she slaps him during her vain attempt to get them to search for the now very dead Johnny. Much has been made out of the fact that he's black. Romero will tell you that this means nothing, or nothing more than that Jones was the best actor they could find for the part, regardless of race. Again, the roots of NotLD's greatness are exposed-- They were neither conforming to nor defying tradition. They simply made it their way.The core of the film is not especially eventful Ben works to barricade the house, and eventually argues with the unexpected tenants in the basement, two couples and one child. These scenes show that Romero really knew what he was doing from the very beginning, and that his experience in industrial films and commercials wasn't wasted. The film somehow maintains a slightly hypnotic intensity in the section as Ben seals of the house while the all to calm radio announcer drones on and on in a hopeless attempt to get a grip on the whole extraordinary situation. Romero keeps the camera moving and the editing sharp so that even after over 10 viewing my mind never wanders in this seemingly uneventful section of the film. (This is a good description of the visual style of the film in general, as it is far from flashy and very realistic, but still energetic enough that it never really feels flat.) And then there is, of course, Ben's dramatic monologue about his first encounter with the things. This scene has been surpassed a few times in later films, like Jaws or 28 Days Later, but it still holds up very well.Eventually, the majority of the farmhouse's residents determine that it's best not to simply wait around for help, and plan a fairly reasonable escape. Suffice to say, things do not go well. I don't want to go into too many specific as it'll hurt the film, but this part is really quite brilliant. Their plan seems really quite reasonable on the face of it, but it proves disastrous. Fate and human error intervene, and we a treated to one of the earliest gore scenes you'll ever see outside of an H.G. Lewis film, as the ghouls feed on charred remains while ominous, amelodic electronic music drones on in the background. Again, this isn't remarkably gruesome by modern day standards, but it's probably the creepiest zombie-feast scene ever filmed.Shortly after this things spiral out of control between the survivors, and all hell break's loose, leading up to one of the greatest endings in all film. Again, I won't go into specifics, but it's just such a classic, senselessly tragic endings. It's been knocked off many times, but the ending here still has the sorta authenticity that you find in all the rest of the film. This isn't a morose, violent ending that a supposedly edgy director stuffed on to prove how far he'd push boundaries This is just they way it happened to turn out. Just a great film.

At a resort in which she vacationed with her family, she was intrigued by dance instructor Johnny and his bad boy image. This is a summer in which Baby is faced with moralistic issues ranging from premarital sex, deception, adultery, theft and abortion (to name a few).Even the title of this film offers a sense of vulgarity which I connected with the type of dancing since it so close and the amount of body contact. They way the characters dressed were also very sexual with the frequent showing of flesh and the idea that this type of dancing hinted at sort of a foreplay act.On the more religious aspect of the film, Baby lies to her father about needing money to help out a friend, something that she never had done to her father before. The reason for her lie is to help out a less fortunate cause. As if lying wasn't bad enough, the money she lied to borrow from her father was to go towards Penny's abortion. Another immoral act in the film involved the old married couple who stole from the members of the resort, this contributed to the many morally wrong acts that occur in the movie as well.Although the film contains many religious and moral issues, it also tells a love story and shows the growth of a naive young woman as she is faced with the everyday problems that are a huge part of the world today. While she made some wrong choices herself, she learned from others mistakes and grew up throughout the whole process.Despite the fact that Dirty Dancing contains a lot of moral issues which I do not agree with, but contrary to those facts I still enjoy the film.

He wanted to make a porno back in the early 70's that an audience would stay around for after they got their satisfaction. He wanted art from what would be sleaze.Recently, I saw a IFC documentary called Chop Socky Cinema Hong Kong in which Woo himself describes his beautifully choreographed gun play style to that of traditional swordplay Hong Kong films that Woo grew up on. And he's right, when we see his violence, its not just to count bodies (well, maybe). But there's a helluva lot of difference between most shoot the character for fun, and forget about him. Chow Yun-Fat's character of Jef or John (depends upon the translation you get of the film) is the ultimate in modern cool, just like Melville's under seen and always watchable hit-man Jef Costello in Woo's favorite film (or one of them, at least) Le Samouari (a must-see, by the way, even Tarnatino listed it as an influence on his Reservior Dogs DVD) Like Costello, Chow's Jef dresses well, is handsome, confident and damn good at killing people. (When the film was released in Hong Kong, scores of men wanted to dress like him.) So far, so commonplace in every film. Line the victims up, and let Woo do the fancy gun play and you would get ... just an adrenaline high. A man who shoots unbelievably well, and that's it.A good Woo film never settles for an empty thrill, or a visual stroke. It's about why he kills, and the choices he made in making a mistake that make us care, that make us want to stay after the guns. The key to a good John Woo film is honor among thieves -- something like this doesn't exist in every world but in a romanticized world of John Woo it's the only thing that makes worth living for a man like Jeff.(Note how he cares about an accidentally shot girl on a beach and consoles her as he drives her to the hospital; Tarantino might have used something like that scene for Reservior Dogs.)Woo grew up on streets as mean or meaner than Martin Scorese, but like Scorsese he was also raised Catholic. So like Scorsese, violence is a factor in the people he portrays, but in the heroes, so is compassion. That woman whom he shot becomes Jeff's salvation. His unrequited love is Platonic; he is a killing machine but also compassionate towards mankind. If this was a Western-cowboy genre, Yun-Fat would have a black hat in the beginning, and then, to save the girl, a white hat. In order to bring his own redemption to the violence he creates, he teams with Inspector Ling (Danny Lee) to fight the requisite bad guys in a church with the now standard Woo doves flying out of the church signifying a final war is about to begin for one man's soul. (The church is an excellent choice, because the film is about the brotherhood of man Jef's now dead mentor was a father to him, Ling's dead partner was a friend; and Sally, who both men try to save from blindness and death, is a holy innocent.The body count is immense. But there is a purpose this time a killer's soul. There is action, but ism spirituality among the characters. They are, granted, almost too one-dimensional at times by Western standards, but they define themselves by actions and little word play. This is the type of film that pleases both our violent natures .., and supplies a little chicken soup for the idea of redemption too (covered in guns, bullets, and blood.)

It's about why he kills, and the choices he made in making a mistake that make us care, that make us want to stay after the guns. The key to a good John Woo film is honor among thieves -- something like this doesn't exist in every world but in a romanticized world of John Woo it's the only thing that makes worth living for a man like Jeff.(Note how he cares about an accidentally shot girl on a beach and consoles her as he drives her to the hospital; Tarantino might have used something like that scene for Reservior Dogs.)Woo grew up on streets as mean or meaner than Martin Scorese, but like Scorsese he was also raised Catholic. So like Scorsese, violence is a factor in the people he portrays, but in the heroes, so is compassion. That woman whom he shot becomes Jeff's salvation. His unrequited love is Platonic; he is a killing machine but also compassionate towards mankind. If this was a Western-cowboy genre, Yun-Fat would have a black hat in the beginning, and then, to save the girl, a white hat. In order to bring his own redemption to the violence he creates, he teams with Inspector Ling (Danny Lee) to fight the requisite bad guys in a church with the now standard Woo doves flying out of the church signifying a final war is about to begin for one man's soul. (The church is an excellent choice, because the film is about the brotherhood of man Jef's now dead mentor was a father to him, Ling's dead partner was a friend; and Sally, who both men try to save from blindness and death, is a holy innocent.The body count is immense.

Not really knowing what to expect, the film's opening of a car thief being stopped by BB (the robot) made me laugh immediately. The movie made me sad in a way, especially when BB gets blown to bits and the scenes with Kristy Swanson in her zombie form, desperately longing for Matthew Laborteaux' love. Wes Craven's signature is all over the film.

It's very, very shocking even now, and even more so for its time (when it was nominated for a Best Picture many Hollywood heavyweights refused to even show for the ceremony), and Stanley Kubrick's stale, disgusting vision of the future still strikes a specific, hidden nerve. It tells the story of Alex, a juvenile delinquent who adores violence and rape of all kinds. When he is imprisoned for murder, he becomes a test subject for a new form of torture that is supposed to reform criminals of violent behaviours by associating images of violence, blood and rape with severe physical sickness. After two weeks, Alex emerges spineless and brainwashed, and considerably less menacing - a clockwork 'orange'; that is, orangutan - symbolic of his weak facade to try and fit into society once more. After this point, it's very hard to watch, because once Alex is released back in his tiny world, he learns there really is no forgiveness of any kind. What's funny throughout is that the violence of Alex and his companions pales in comparison to the violence exerted on them by the government and their world in general - for example, a regular bar is filled with horrifying pornographic images, wholly unnecessary measures and cruelty are used during the treatment...and perhaps most troubling of all is that Alex's former companions, upon his 'reform', have since become part of the police force. There really is no right or wrong. By the end we realize that what we thought was terrible at the beginning doesn't really mean anything. And what's scary is that the lonely world of A Clockwork Orange really isn't too different from our own. From a debate about whether the treatment is 'right' because it doesn't really change desires to harm, it progresses to a point where the actual reform of a human being seems impossible - there's no way how or why somebody would want to change. Even when the possibility of something other than 'an eye for an eye' is introduced, it turns out to be functionally impossible. Both the film-making and the acting are heavily stylized, cloying, and somewhat difficult to watch - all this works well with the intended effect of the film. Malcolm McDowell pulled off a difficult role reasonably well, but he's not too great. The rest of the characters stick in your head in a distinctly Fellini-esquire manner, which makes for a memorable storyline. The themes of regression vs. progression are toyed with in a way that really makes you think about the 'progress' we've supposedly gone through in the past century or so.

Since Steve Buscemi is here too, you can predict the tone of the comedy, which is very dryly hilarious - the point of the movie is to contrast tragedy with comedy for a haunting and bittersweet ending. An interesting idea, but the tragedy wasn't tragic enough, it was disaffected in an odd way. Normally gruesome scenes are trivialized in a way that I don't like.

But Blue Velvet was the only film I've seen to date that shocked me far more than I thought it would. It's hard to say exactly what it was, but it did such a grotesquely fine job of carving out sickness from beneath an idyllic front that it couldn't help but be disturbing. It's also partly because David Lynch is a genius - some of the camera angles alone are enough to give you nightmares. Jeffrey is a young guy visiting his hometown when his father has a stroke. He finds a human ear in a field, and when he tries to find out more about it independently, he's drawn farther and farther into the world of sado-masochistic violence via Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini in a troubling role) and her tormentor, until he uncovers some unsavory findings about his own soul. Dennis Hopper - from Easy Rider - gives an absolutely disgusting performance as Frank. I mean, really, really disgusting. This from a person who thought Hannibal Lecter was kind of cool - trust me on this. All in all, the satirical film-making and saturated color, together with Rossellini's and Hopper's performances, make it really disturbing.

Everybody compares this movie to Goodfellas (which was one of the most horrendous movies I've seen that wasn't outright 'bad') but in truth it was much better. It was much worse than what Scorcese is capable of at the top of his game, however, which makes it watchable. Dancing around the theme of redemption, like so many Scorcese films, it tells of Ace Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a crook trying to redeem himself and go straight, and who ends up running a fancy casino. Awesome, right? Wrong. He falls in love with a hooker (Ginger), marries her, and then his best friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci, playing a trigger-happy psycho for once!) comes and wants his share of what Vegas has to offer. Except Nicky's not even trying to go straight. Ginger ends up an abusive, cheating junkie bitch on wheels, and Nicky, by virtue of his relations with Ace, ends up messing Ace's life up in a big way. A main theme in this movie is trust - Ace begins with saying there can be no love without trust, and by the end it turns out Ace shouldn't have trusted anybody. Robert De Niro gave a pretty good performance - nothing compared, of course, to Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, or The King of Comedy - but he is from head to toe a fundamentally good guy with his head on right, who in fact tends to live too much in his head until he crashes for Ginger. He recovers quickly enough, though, and although he isn't perfect, we want him to win. One of the interesting points of the performance is that even though Ace is so logical and tough, when he gets hurt it's unbearable. Joe Pesci was OK, nothing compared to his performance in Raging Bull of course, and while I'm tempted to say Sharon Stone was awful she wasn't that bad. In my opinion Scorcese was a lot better before all the expensive sets and frou-frou camera-work. It just gets in the way of his message. I guess ultimately it's about how your life adds up at the end of the day, and how you can escape your past. It's got a very Catholic tone to it with respect to absolution - it seems to convey the thought that if you're just sorry enough for your sins, everything will work out.

Some of the jokes did give me a few giggles, but House II The Second Story just doesn't win me over as others. It is a nostalgia trip for some fans, I believe, remembering with fondness scenes like when our heroes lose a crystal skull with jewel eyes to a baby pterodactyl, or having to deal with doors that lead to alternate times\/universes, having to overcome an undead gunslinger looking for said skull (which grants eternal life), and other characters who escape into the house to nap the skull for their own specific purposes (one mute Neanderthal who looks like a steroid freak, grabs the skull, taking it back to his prehistoric time which has creatures that look a bit off-the-wall such as a green worm dog or the aforementioned baby dino-bird who flies its way into the house, complicating matters for our heroes). Arye Gross is the lead and he has one of those recognizable faces you have seen on shows like Law & Order and CSI, while his hard-partying buddy Charlie is played by Jonathan Stark (known to many as Chris Sarandon's casket guard in Fright Night), and the two of them give all they can (the cast as a whole is game, working their asses off to make the material as humorous as possible) to this movie. Ethan Wiley had to have been grateful that despite the movie's many failings, his cast pressed hard to make this entertaining. The film's heart and soul is Royal Dano. Dano, as the zombie great grandfather of Gross' Jessie, who had a falling out with an ex partner over the skull (responsible for killing Jessie's parents twenty-five years ago when he was a baby), returning from the grave trying to protect it, has a good-old-koot likability that is infectious and lovable. You can't help but embrace Dano the moment his undead carcass comes back to life, popping out his casket ready to have a grand old time. Lots of familiar faces show up in small parts such as Bill Mahr as a wiseass big-shot record producer, Lar Park Lincoln (as the telekinetic adversary of Jason Voorhies in Friday the 13th VII) as Jessie's girlfriend (who Mahr eyes, using sneaky tactics to win her from Jessie), Amy Yasbeck (Problem Child; the widow of the late, great John Ritter) as Charlie's wannabe singer\/star (and girlfriend), and John Ratzenberger (Cheers) as a sword-wielding electrician (!) who finds a dimensional door by making an accidental hole in the wall. The film has this aiming to please energy about it, with kitchen sink approach that throws a little bit of everything at the viewer, so I could see why many find it enjoyable. I don't think it's very good, if I'm honest, and there were times I just rolled my eyes, but this viewing experience was better than the painful previous sit-down. Best suited, I think, for late night viewing with a beer\/drink, popcorn, and time to kill.

She was then forced to move in with her father Roy who she really didn't consider to be her dad. Being the only white girl in a black community she felt very out of place in school and not too safe walking around the streets at night.

She introduces Sara to some of her friends and everything seems to be going fine.Even though she seemed to have made friends it doesn't mean people technically agree with her having feelings with a black boy. At first Derek and Sara didn't get along then they started to hang out and dance together. This is when she started to fall for him. One scene that sticks out in my mind was when Sara and Derek were on the train together and the old lady kept starring at them. She was disgusted to see an interracial couple. In her days it wasn't fine to see that, today in the 21st century it is more normal but still not to accepting. Another scene that showed someone cared that they were together was at the club. One time was with Derek's ex-girlfriend Nikki. Derek and Sara were dancing and Nikki got jealous and told Sara off saying just because she is white she thinks can come and take what's hers hence Derek. Despite what everyone else thought they were in love. They only cared about each other and those who didn't mind them being together. They were both splitting and going their different ways when they movie was over. Derek going off to medical school and Sara being accepted to Julliard, we will never know what ends up happening to them unless they make another movie. Whatever does happen though will work out for the best of them I feel.

This movie was about a white girl named Sara Johnson who fell for a black boy named Derek Reynolds. Sara originally lived in the Midwest until the death of her mother. She was then forced to move in with her father Roy who she really didn't consider to be her dad. Being the only white girl in a black community she felt very out of place in school and not too safe walking around the streets at night. She met Chenille Reynolds who we eventually figure out is Derek's sister. Chenille welcomes her and makes her feel at home. She introduces Sara to some of her friends and everything seems to be going fine.Even though she seemed to have made friends it doesn't mean people technically agree with her having feelings with a black boy.

The plot is solid, the imaginative sets are nicely lit, and there are some accomplished performances from the young cast. But Ms Balk captivates, mesmerises, shocks, scares, and charms her way through every one of her scenes. Tunney may play the central character and has many of the best moments to herself, but Balk's range - from a cheeky wink to a full-blooded rage - is what provides the entertainment here.Watching it again now makes me wonder if it may have influenced elements of Buffy, especially the later Willow episodes. It has that same quality feel to it, same beautiful set design, even the magic shop looks familiar. The theme however is a little more adult, and the humour more low-key. Like Buffy, there is a certain morality to it all, and witchcraft is certainly not glamourized. Did Willow getting hooked and going off the rails in some part pay homage to Balk's performance here? Overall a likable movie and one I could watch over and over. Probably appeals to different generations on different levels, but I think it's a worthy piece of art and technically, quite brilliant in places.

Somebody described it as tender but never sentimental which I think describes it perfectly. It tells the story of two teenage hustlers at a specific period in their lives. Mike (River Phoenix) is somewhat of an enigma. He is dreamy, gentle, and in love with his best friend. He is also, unfortunately, a narcoleptic, and is obsessed with finding his long-lost mother. Scott (Keanu Reeves) is his best friend, who is a rich boy and only prostitutes himself as a way to be rebellious and humiliate his father. A plot is somewhat secondary, since the movie is about the inner lives of its two main characters (given Reeves' acting talent, more like one main character) but there are a few points I will mention...an older homeless guy named Bob is also in love with Scott, although it's more of a father\/son thing. In the scenes with Bob, Shakespearian dialogue straight out of Henry IV is used - and unfortunately, the story has the same turnout Scott (Henry) comes into his fortune and reforms himself, refusing to associate with any of his old friends, and ultimately breaking Bob's (Falstaff's) heart in two, and he dies. Kenneth Branaugh pulled Henry off pretty well, in part because Henry's motives are unselfish (good of the country) whereas Scott is only concerned with money and himself. When Scott and Mike go to Italy to try and find Mike's mom, she's long gone, but Scott falls in love with an Italian girl (Sorry Mike!) and abandons his friend to a life of prostitution, completely alone. By the end of the movie, Scott is in a three-piece suit and Mike is fast asleep in the middle of a road in Idaho. The film does a great job portraying the unending loneliness in our souls that we attempt to break up by human relationships that never end up meaning anything. Every man is an island. It also conveys a sense of there only being the past - the future never seems to enter Mike's consciousness. Overall wonderful, although uneven and slow in parts. River Phoenix is not a great actor, but he was much better than I expected him to be. He seems like he's from another planet, but he's so sweet all the time and never seems to have any hatred in him - not even when Scott deserts him. He does a great job portraying the painful plight of the gay best friend...and the guy who played Bob was also pretty good. Not Keanu, though. Scott is supposed to undergo pretty radical character development, but Reeves just goes on AutoKeanu which really isn't too exciting to watch, all considered.

Luke Jackson, a down-on-his-luck war veteran, is arrested for vandalising parking meters while drunk and sentenced to imprisonment in a brutally tough prison. At first his offhand, seemingly arrogant, attitude alienates not only the prison governor and guards but also his fellow-prisoners, and he is soon challenged to a fight by another inmate named Dragline. The tall, powerfully built Dragline is an easy victor, but Luke's determination and fighting spirit, never knowing when he is beaten and refusing to quit, arouse the respect of the others, especially Dragline who becomes his close friend. Luke becomes a hero to the prisoners because they see him as a rebel who refuses to be beaten by the system. (His nickname stems from the cool way in which he plays a hand at poker, but it also refers to his remaining cool in the face of persecution). Luke makes two escape attempts, but on both occasions he is recaptured and brought back to the prison for punishment by the guards who are determined to break his spirit. It seems that they have succeeded, but then Luke and Dragnet make one last break for freedom.On one level this film is a critique of the inhumanity of the American prison system, part of a tradition going back to I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang and continuing more recently with Brubaker (also directed by Stuart Rosenberg) and the less successful The Last Castle. The regime in this jail is particularly inhuman. The prisoners are put to work all day digging ditches in the hot sun. (It is never made clear whether the ditches need to be dug and the prisoners are a useful source of free labour, or whether putting them to demeaning and useless work is seen as a means of keeping them under control and of giving vent to the sadistic impulses of their jailers). There is a long list of petty regulations, breach of which is punished by a night in the box, a tiny cell used for solitary confinement. The guards take a perverse delight in tormenting and humiliating the prisoners. Strother Martin's governor (who prefers to be called the Captain) is a particularly frightening figure, a little man with a grating, high-pitched voice who can even make a piece of bland management-speak like What we have here is a failure to communicate sound like a terrifying threat.The film is more, however, than a social-realist exposure of conditions in America's jails. It was made in the sixties, the decade when the times they were a-changing and when traditional concepts of authority were being challenged everywhere. Like a number of films from the sixties and seventies, Cool Hand Luke reflects this popular mood. The film with which it has most in common is One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in which Jack Nicholson does for mental asylums what Paul Newman does here for prisons. Newman's screen persona was often that of the cool, detached outsider. This may have had the effect of narrowing his range as an actor somewhat- he could often seem too laid back in more traditional types of film, such as Hitchcock's Torn Curtain- but it meant that he could be excellent playing anti-heroes in films of this nature. (Hombre is another example). Here, in one of his best performances, he makes Luke a symbol of the little man standing up against authority. We learn that he was a hero in the war and was decorated a number of times but that he finished the war as a private after being demoted from sergeant. The implication is that military discipline was as uncongenial to him as prison discipline and that he lost his rank for some act of insubordination. Even his crime can be seen as a protest against the petty tyranny of rules and regulations of which parking meters are a symbol.There has been speculation about the possible religious implications of the film and whether Luke is intended to be a Christ-figure. Certainly, the shot in which he is seen in a crucifix-like pose after the egg-eating contest is derived from standard Christian imagery, but in my view this is not a deliberate Christian allegory along the lines of Whistle Down the Wind or The Omega Man. In orthodox Christian thought, Christ is much more than a rebel against authority or even a man unjustly persecuted; he is also the Son of God and the Redeemer of mankind. One scene does not an allegory make. Nevertheless, there are undoubted religious overtones to the film. If Luke is an allegorical figure, the allegory is not with Christ but with Everyman, a man in search (sometimes a despairing search) of God. He claims not to believe in God, yet has long conversations with Him. The song he sings after the death of his mother is irreverent, possibly blasphemous, but blasphemy is the sin of the angry believer, not of the unbeliever. A true atheist cannot blaspheme, because there is nothing for him to blaspheme against.Newman was nominated for Best Actor and George Kennedy won a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Dragline, but I was surprised that the film was not nominated as Best Picture, especially as the nominations in 1968 included a film as weak as Dr Doolittle. Whatever the Academy may have thought, however, Cool Hand Luke is a film that has matured well. It is a multi-layered film that works well on each of its several levels of meaning. With I am a Fugitive&#133;. and The Birdman of Alcatraz, it is one of the greatest of all prison dramas. This was Stuart Rosenberg's first feature film, but like Orson Welles (Citizen Kane), Sidney Lumet (Twelve Angry Men) and Bryan Forbes (Whistle Down the Wind) he made a great film on his first attempt. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 May 2006","score":"11 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":" This film is set in America's Deep South in the years after the Second World War.

This may have had the effect of narrowing his range as an actor somewhat- he could often seem too laid back in more traditional types of film, such as Hitchcock's Torn Curtain- but it meant that he could be excellent playing anti-heroes in films of this nature. (Hombre is another example). Here, in one of his best performances, he makes Luke a symbol of the little man standing up against authority. We learn that he was a hero in the war and was decorated a number of times but that he finished the war as a private after being demoted from sergeant. The implication is that military discipline was as uncongenial to him as prison discipline and that he lost his rank for some act of insubordination. Even his crime can be seen as a protest against the petty tyranny of rules and regulations of which parking meters are a symbol.There has been speculation about the possible religious implications of the film and whether Luke is intended to be a Christ-figure. Certainly, the shot in which he is seen in a crucifix-like pose after the egg-eating contest is derived from standard Christian imagery, but in my view this is not a deliberate Christian allegory along the lines of Whistle Down the Wind or The Omega Man. In orthodox Christian thought, Christ is much more than a rebel against authority or even a man unjustly persecuted; he is also the Son of God and the Redeemer of mankind. One scene does not an allegory make. Nevertheless, there are undoubted religious overtones to the film. If Luke is an allegorical figure, the allegory is not with Christ but with Everyman, a man in search (sometimes a despairing search) of God. He claims not to believe in God, yet has long conversations with Him. The song he sings after the death of his mother is irreverent, possibly blasphemous, but blasphemy is the sin of the angry believer, not of the unbeliever. A true atheist cannot blaspheme, because there is nothing for him to blaspheme against.Newman was nominated for Best Actor and George Kennedy won a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Dragline, but I was surprised that the film was not nominated as Best Picture, especially as the nominations in 1968 included a film as weak as Dr Doolittle. Whatever the Academy may have thought, however, Cool Hand Luke is a film that has matured well. It is a multi-layered film that works well on each of its several levels of meaning. With I am a Fugitive&#133;. and The Birdman of Alcatraz, it is one of the greatest of all prison dramas. This was Stuart Rosenberg's first feature film, but like Orson Welles (Citizen Kane), Sidney Lumet (Twelve Angry Men) and Bryan Forbes (Whistle Down the Wind) he made a great film on his first attempt. 9\/10 ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"9 May 2006","score":"7 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Sure, Phantasm is about as low budget as you can get, even for a horror film, but the amazing thing about this movie is that a lack of funds did not hurt it at all. In fact, some of the plot holes that a bigger budget would have filled in actually work in the movie's favor. By not really understanding who the Tall Man is or why he does what he does, Phantasm assumes enigmatic dimensions that practically beg for explanation through further sequels. Coscarelli, who I think is planning yet another sequel in this franchise, has also made a few other films over the years the recent Bubba Ho-tep and the ubiquitous cable favorite The Beastmaster are the most memorable.Reggie, Jody, and Jody's younger brother Mike soon learn strange things are afoot at the Morningside Funeral Home. After a funeral service for a friend of Reggie and Jody, Mike sees the eerie undertaker at the funeral home heave a three hundred pound casket in the back of a hearse all by himself. Intrigued, Mike begins to investigate the funeral home and this puzzling figure, fondly known to fans of the series as the Tall Man, and unearths a whole heap of weirdness. Before long Jody and Reggie get caught up in the madness of the Tall Man's world. What they discover behind the walls of the funeral home is a nightmare of endless dangers twisted, angry little creatures clad in robes, a portal to another dimension, and small flying spheres that seek out human flesh with disastrous and bloody results. As the three attempt to put together the odd pieces of this puzzle, the Tall Man and his minions always lurk in the background ready to do serious bodily injury to the interlopers. What Reggie, Mike, and Jody discover is hardly reassuring the Tall Man is some sort of other dimensional being roaming our world in search of corpses. He then reanimates the bodies and transforms them into stunted little creatures so he can transport them into his dimension. Why does he do this? Who knows, but it is fun watching our three heroes battle the Tall Man in this film and the subsequent sequels.One of the best elements of Phantasm is the characters. You have the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), a lumbering giant of a man dressed all in black and sporting a perpetual scowl. He delivers his lines, of which there are few in this movie but more in subsequent films, in a growling tone full of dark menace. Scrimm is creepy as the Tall Man, and I think this character may well be one of my favorite horror film bad guys. The actors who play Reggie, Jody, and Mike appear in all of the sequels (with a minor switch in two), an important continuity because it gives the Phantasm franchise a real contained universe feel lacking in most horror series. It was fun for me to watch the original film after seeing the later sequels because the guys are so much younger here. Jody sports a '70's coif that would do Starsky and Hutch proud, and Reggie looks so young that it is almost frightening.Phantasm films always contain elements that make for a great, downbeat atmosphere. The music is absolutely fantastic, and if I had to compare the background beats of Phantasm with the sound of another horror film it would have to be something along the lines of Kubrick's The Shining. The movie sounds creepy, and when matched with the mostly shot at night scenes and the wickedly gory rampages of those metallic spheres, the whole film takes on a most memorable feel. Coscarelli does not rely solely on gripping horror, however, as there are many humorous scenes throughout the film. The scene where Mike and Jody do battle with the severed finger is one of the funniest I have seen in a horror movie. Even the fake looking bug and the gruesome little minions of the Tall Man are amusing in their own right.If you want to buy just one DVD because of the extras, you should get Phantasm if you can track down a copy(it's gone OOP now). I couldn't believe how much stuff they packed on one disc! You get lengthy deleted scenes, a commentary with Coscarelli and the film's actors, a long interview with Coscarelli and Angus Scrimm made years ago with some film professor, a short film of an appearance Angus Scrimm made at a horror convention, trailers, a disco version of the theme song (!), poster and lobby card pictures, a kooky promotional ad made by Angus Scrimm for the Australian market, and a widescreen picture transfer. I especially enjoyed the footage of Scrimm speaking at a horror film convention. Even though it was a bit corny, he quickly ran through all of the lines the Tall Man said in the Phantasm films, and since most of his dialogue in these movies is so memorable it was great to hear him say them in character. Overall, it felt like it took longer to view all of the extras on this disc than it did to watch the film! If you haven't delved into the dark world of Phantasm, start here and rapidly move on to the excellent sequels.

Instead of the loquacious, witty character he played in the former film, the audience is instead presented with the stony, taciturn Nishi who could give a blank piece of slate a run for its money for a deadpan expression. Not knowing quite what to expect and having the whimsical images of Kikujiro still in my head, I was a bit disappointed with the film when I watched it the first time, but after repeated viewings and having viewed most films in which he has directed and\/or acted has given me a greater appreciation of the film which many still consider Kitano's masterpiece.A very quiet and sometimes brutal man, Nishi works alongside his partner Horibe to keep crime, yakuza, down in the streets of Tokyo. If this job was not stressful enough, Nishi has also recently suffered the loss of his daughter and his wife has been diagnosed with leukemia. In order to make ends meet and to pay his wife's increasing hospital bills Nishi is forced to borrow money from the yakuza who he is supposed to be keeping off the street. However, unlike most who are in dept to the yakuza, Nishi is unafraid of those who he is in debt to and even goes as far as to pierce the eye of one yakuza with a pair of chopsticks. With his stoic nature it seems that Nishi is willing to endure his life's situation for as long as it takes. However, one-day Nishi's world is turned upside down.While on a stakeout with Horibe and two other policemen named Tanaka and Nakamura Horibe suggests that Nishi go to the hospital to check on his wife.
