All these family movies have the boilerplate `'I hate you, Dad\/Mom'&#133;'save me, Dad\/Mom'&#133;'I love you,  Dad\/Mom'' subplots, as if they're required by law.  I thought such subplots were dumb when I was young enough to appreciate family movies.  As an 18-year-old, they look even stupider.  I don't think anyone truly gets anything from them.  Even the dumbest jokes were a better investment of time.Still, it's not all bad.  Silly movies like this can be much worse.  The acting was decent, assuming that several actors were still kids.  It's sad that they did a career-crushing film like this.  Of the five kids, only Rachael Leigh Cook has had a remotely notable role since (`She's All That,' almost three years later).  As for the adults, I was impressed with Rod Steiger and David Paymer, but couldn't they find something better?Most would be horrified to think about a sequel, but with so much to improve, I doubt it could be worse.

The hijacker could be an early-20's guy so he can have a love\/hate relationship with Kayla.  You groan, but would you rather a cheesy parent\/child relationship?)  These are just my ravings even if you could get the actors to return, the reputation of the original would still be there.  Then again, maybe the public has forgotten after four years.My overall impression this movie is as mediocre as it gets; just how so depends on your age group.  Kids will enjoy the bad jokes.  Adolescent boys will enjoy Kayla's outfit.

Take the opening scene, where the camera zooms out through a human brain until we're staring down the barrel of a gun.

One of the best acting performances I have ever seen. He is just so cool, which I know it hardly a good way to review it, but it is true!I was quite surprised that this film was snubbed by the Oscars, but I guess that a film that attacks society is hardly going to be rewarded by the Academy - wealthy people who believe they have more of a right to decide what is good than us! Besides, don't let the lack of box-office success bother you. In a few years time, this film will have cult status and be a modern classic.The one negative point I can offer, is the film will never ever be able to give you the initial rush you get when you see it for the first time.

She tends to believe in the supernatural, he does not, but both are spurred on by the danger of both discovery and the bombs raining down on London. Perversely, when her husband confides to Maurice his suspicion that Sarah is having an affair, Maurice hires a private detective to investigate, in effect, himself. In the end, it is God who decrees the finale, not the characters, who accommodate as best they can to their destinies.Do we really care? This is not easy to answer. Maurice, the narrator, is a prize prick, unfeeling of others, concentrated on his misery and his work, yet obsessively jealous. Sarah provides a focus for his substantial sex drive but he does develop an affection for her. Sarah, on the other hand, clearly likes a good bonk as well, but she needs the relationship to full the void left by her husband's emotional absence, and Maurice is too self-centred to be a real soulmate. She is also quite a nice person in comparison with nasty bitter old Maurice. So yes, we are sorry for her. We have to admire Maurice for being honest enough to tell the story but there is an air of self-flagellation about it. As a film, this is a terrific piece of work, directed by the Irish director Neil Jordan who was responsible for The Crying Game. Greene is a very cinematic novelist - at last count there were at least 40 screen versions of his works - and Jordan has very cleverly used a present - flashback - present and then forward technique to tell the story from both Maurice's and Sarah's viewpoint. The gloom and danger of wartime London is effectively invoked but there was a bit of overkill in having it rain almost continuously from 1939 to 1945 (London has less rain days than Sydney!) It struck me early on that Ralph Fiennes was by no means inevitable in the part - I was reminded of the early Sam Neill. His character is really rather empty - a man whose only real commitments are to his work and sex. Julianne Moore, delightfully bad as Mrs Cheveley in An Ideal Husband, and delightfully slapstick as the childish Cora in Cookie's Fortune, is much more sympathetic here. Stephen Rea (a Jordan favourite) as the cuckold is the most sympathetic of the lot or at least the most self-aware. He gives us a wonderful portrayal of stitched up dismay and yet it does not seem beyond the bounds of credibility that, knowing of the affair, he should invite Maurice to come and live with them towards the end.Greeneland is a pretty bleak place, but a couple of apparent miracles brighten things up. Greene clearly thought God had a sense of humour. The novel is said to be semi-autobiographical, but the real affair Greene had with the wife of a wealthy businessman, while no doubt equally painful, did not end so melodramatically as the novel. Looking at a biography of Greene by Michael Shelden I note that Catherine Walston, whose relationship with Greene was the chief inspiration for The End of the Affair, died in 1978, aged 62, 13 years before Greene. According to Shelden, Catherine refused to see Greene on her deathbed because she didn't want him to see how sick she was. The affair itself petered out in the early fifties, though they remained in touch. Henry Walston, it seemed, asserted himself and demanded that Catherine cut down on her contact with Greene. Greene went overseas to find danger and forget, to Vietnam and elsewhere, and these trips produced at least one more major novel, The Quiet American. However Greene's career as a writer peaked with The End of the Affair. His later work is interesting and readable, but never again did he reach the same emotional depths and heights.Greene is often said to be a Catholic novelist but on the basis of this work at least he wasn't a great pitchman for the Almighty. Greene was, however, an eloquent portrayer of spiritual suffering and this aspect has been effectively brought to the screen by Neil Jordan. Perhaps it takes an Irishman to understand an English Catholic.

The contrast between the Muslim culture and the Viking culture is wonderful.  Banderas is constantly faced with the rowdy Viking attitude.  They spit and growl and drink and cuss and fight and kill.  Banderas plays an Arab who can't abide much of their behavior, but they grow on him and he becomes `little brother' to them.  Banderas starts to earn his Viking stripes by figuring out their language, then he shows what a brilliant horseman he is, and then ultimately (of course) he is a marvelous swordsman and a brave fighter. The Eaters of the Dead are even more repugnant to him than his funky brother Vikings, and so he fights them with gusto.  It is easy to fall in love with the Viking culture, they laugh constantly, and live fiercely.  It would not have been an easy life, but seeing the wolf capes and beautifully carved and crafted boats are just wonderful.  This movie is a visual delight.  It was just my cup of tea.

Then a movie about two hit men, a boxer, a mob boss and his wife, a gold watch and a suitcase came along and restored my faith in film. There are only two flaws in Pulp. The scenes w\/Butch and Fabion drag a little and the movie ends. One complaint that I often hear is that people don't understand what the movie was about. The movie is about Redemption plain and simple. Some people don't see it but it is there. I still remember the first time I saw it and I kept trying to figure out where the movie was going. I was wrong everytime I guessed. Another great thing about it is that each story can work independently of each other. I've watched the three stories separately and still enjoy each one of them. My favourite story is The Bonnie Situation. Much needed comic relief after The Gold Watch. Great stories, great script, great cast, great music and simply the best movie ever made.

Final Destination is a creepy, atmospheric, and surprisingly scary film. I actually felt sorry for the characters, even if they weren't developed enough, because their dilemma is engaging.
