Excellent source material, an excellent director and a excellent cast. Which more is needed, right? Unfortunately, nothing works. The adaptation of the classic book to the film is mediocre at best. The story came in pieces, and is absolutely incoherent further first viewing, that is the most important. It improves upon a second viewing, mostly because you can pay attention to other aspects of the film which is impossible to do with the consistent cuts and scenes rising out of nowhere in first viewing.Still, there are totally nonsense scenes (the cemetery scene is a prime example) in the film that are there for whatever reason. The film captures one of the most important aspects in the book, that is the ambient, the erotic and romantic atmosphere contrasting with the horrific monsters and the dark, Gothic tone given by the excellent art direction. The visual effects tough, are outdated and horrible, it is even awful at times.The acting, apart for the good performance by Gary Oldman, is average and even mediocre at times. Winona Ryder is pretty disappointing in it. Keanu Reeves it's in one of his best performances here, and still that's not saying too much. Anthony Hopkins is meh, neither good nor bad, just mildly convincing. The first sequence, explaining how 'Draculia' turns in 'Dracula' has one of the worst acting efforts I've seen in a long while. But despite that, it's not as big as a problem as the editing is. Frankly, it's a disappointing film mostly because it had everything to be a great and big one. It seems that everything was done badly and in the laziest and campy way possible. A shame.

I heard a lot of good things about it, plus it had a good presence in the Oscars in 2002(I don't know if anyone cares, but I think it's worth noting) so I finally watched it. And I realized it wasn't impressive. First thing that bothered me was the narrator. It was insufferable bad. I don't like that kind of narrator at all. It looked like I was reading a book instead of watching the film. The worst part is that it really wants to look like a book. The narrative is also weird.

In the end, is just a romance story of a 'late' girl that finds in the introversion and in the fantasy(her biggest allies) are now troubling and ruining her life.

Being said, everything on it seems necessary for the whole experience. Not the best or most entertaining three hours long-plus film I've watched, since that it varies from extremely good to very bad and melodramatic moments. Very inconsistent, but again, mostly good. And it's impossible to not consider how well made and big this film is, and then consider the age it was done(1939!). It basically did open the doors for the other successful 'epic' films that would come, due to it thunderous success(a film that big in 1939 would obviously make success).What most surprised me was the dark tone of the film, I am certainly it bothered some prudes in the age. Treason and tragedies makes it looks like the film in the poster, which clearly suggests that it's a dull romance film. It does a good work picturing the horrors of war and how it changes people, mostly for bad. There is about a hour and a half passing through the war.The cinematography is nothing less than excellent, but outdated, since that some angles aren't even used anymore. The special effects and the non-stop soundtrack bothered me as well,but not as much as the stage- like exaggerated acting, which was common in the 30s I suppose, but for now it's pretty ridiculous and outdated.Well, I haven't much more to say about this film. If you are facing nothing to do so this film will fits well for you. Though if you are bored and wants something dynamic don't even try this film. It's length is the worst part about this film, even more for an audience that can't stand films that are slowly paced than The Avengers(2012) nowadays.

And of course, the smart thing to do would be to continue the story from the first movie. And for the most part, the sequel stays faithful to the story line. It does have a few areas that need to be addressed but all around it pretty much matches its parent. After the torturous event of Charles Lee Ray (The Lakeshore Strangler) attacking the Barclay home, it was time to move on. Sadly things didn't get better for Andy Barclay. Andy's mother is sent to a psych ward for help and Andy is put into a foster home. Making matters worse, is the Good Guy Doll company somehow acquired the burnt dismembered parts of Chucky and decided to clean him off and put him back together. Unbeknownst to them, once re-assembled, Chucky comes back to life and begins his rampage of violence to find Andy again. And that's all there is to this. It is just another set up to have Chucky (voice by Brad Dourif) killing people to get to the boy that he told his secret to. Is it bad? No, it actually can hold its own as a good sequel.The weakest area is Mr. Mancini's writing. For example, very few audiences are familiar with voodoo and it's never explained to why Chucky came back to life after being re-assembled. Was that apart of the voodoo spell? Besides, in the first movie, wasn't it shooting Chucky in the heart the only way to kill him? That's a big loophole. However, it's also forgivable because a lot of people like Chucky, so it's obvious a lot of people will not care too much. It's crazy though how similar this sequel is like Hellraiser II Hellbound (1988). The director of Hellbound was a crewmember for Hellraiser (1987) and then directed the sequel. Same goes for John Lafia, the director of this film. He too was apart of Child's Play (1988) and then went on to direct the sequel to this franchise. And both sequels are decent and have good continuity but suffer from weak reasoning for the logic behind the continuity. A very similar parallel that is interesting to think about.As for actors, it's obvious that Brad Dourif is needed to play Chucky and his performance is always the best. Next is Alex Vincent whom fans should be happy to see because he's a key part of why Chucky exists and his performance is just as likable as he was from the first movie. Lastly is Christine Elise who plays another foster child named Kyle who befriends Andy. At a point she develops a strong will to fight and it's good that she wasn't written in as a scream and do nothing girl. But as for the rest of the cast, they aren't much to talk about. The foster parents and every other individual are the same. They don't believe a killer doll exists (and right fully so, IF this were a reality). Oh well, their loss.The last couple of elements that viewers should enjoy is the cinematography by Stefan Czapsky and music. Unlike the first movie, which contained grittier and darker colors, this movie has brighter more elementary colors, which give something new for fans to look at. Plus, the music produced by upcoming composer at the time, Graeme Revell, did a much better job than the score from the first movie by Joe Renzetti. Here Revell actually uses an orchestra and not just synths. And, Revell even gives the Child's Play franchise a motif theme and some creepy tunes. A well developed horror score.

Here Revell actually uses an orchestra and not just synths. And, Revell even gives the Child's Play franchise a motif theme and some creepy tunes. A well developed horror score. Does it top its predecessor - no. Is it a good sequel - yes.Like other horror sequels, it lacks clarification on logic but it still amounts to a decent sequel. The score has improved as well allowing to sound more like a horror film.

It had modern special effects concepts that no one understood, casting and characters that went against the normal mentality, and above all things, it was science fiction (not a bankable genre at the time) But when the film was released in May 1977, all the doubts were immediately blasted away and the film became an international and cultural icon.Star Wars is one of those films that takes risks and presents what people can do with a lot of imagination, determination, and a lot of sweat. George Lucas changed cinematic technique forever with this movie. He applied universal themes and classic good vs. evil to a story with mind-blowing effects and a grand spectacle for all ages to come.This particular (now fourth but at the time first) chapter of the long (six-film) story involves the adventure of a young farm boy named Luke Skywalker as he is swept into joining the rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire. He encounters many obstacles and tight situations along the way, before becoming the very hero of the Rebellion. This story, inspired by old space serials on television, may seem initially basic. But the way Lucas conceives his characters and the themes of the story is what makes it truly fresh and original. this begins Luke's emotional journey to becoming a Jedi warrior, and his understanding of a mysterious energy called the Force. This film has classic characterizations, which makes all the more universally appealing. Luke is our innocent blank slate, who becomes just as invested as we do, but he isn't boring. he is a headstrong youth who will jump in feet first if he must. Han is very cynical, but ultimately sees what's important in the end and becomes a good friend. Leia is a not so typical damsel-in-distress. She is much like Luke in spirit, but projects some kind of wisdom beyond her years, which has become typical around Lucasfilm these days, but its not a bad thing. Alec Guinness expertly plays the wise mentor, Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who imparts his wisdom of the force onto Luke and the past story of the now prequel trilogy. Now comes the symbol of all evil in this universe, Darth Vader (physical performance by David Prowse, voice by James Earl Jones) Darth Vader is more famous than the movie itself, and has become the symbol of Star Wars. His commanding presence is terrifying.What separates Star Wars from other films is its distinctive look and effects. The very impressive sets, designed and built in England by Superman designer John Barry, evokes a sleek but what Lucas called used atmosphere. The reason why we buy that these things and sets are for real is that they look like they have been used and lived in for years, and that we can see the rivets and tiniest of details on the models used for the effects. The effects are some of the best that I have and ever will see. All the films in the saga have great effects as well, though some of them have better effects more than others. Just the frenetic pacing and fast action is enough to satisfy any movie goer.I will say, Star Wars isn't Star Wars without John Williams. His greatest known and successful score adds this level of timelessness that Lucas was trying to achieve. The famous fanfare is used everywhere now, as it heralds greatness. Lucas and Williams agreed that this score should be full of motifs and themes that would give an emotional anchor that may not have come across otherwise. While there is the grand and bellicose music for the action, there are very sweet and emotional themes punctuated throughout, making the experience of watching this film even greater.I can't say enough about this magical movie that uses movie magic to its advantage.

Starting off with Tim Burton's trademark dark vision which IMO worked perfect for Batman, mixing the Gothic style Burton is known for with a bit of humor without seeming totally over-the-top. Batman Returns took a darker turn bringing in Burton's stock character of a misfit wanting to be accepted by the fickle society he lives in, but it wasn't as successful, so Burton got the boot and enter Joel Schumacher. Batman Forever was a good popcorn flick, but the villain was weak, as it was basically just Jim Carrey cosplaying as the Riddler. With that out of the way, you may be expecting me to give Batman & Robin a verbal thrashing like many reviews that came before, but honestly, it's not as terrible as people make it out to be. Don't get me wrong, it earned its nasty reputation, but I want to be fair and praise the movie on what it did right. For instance, some of the special effects were good, rubber icicles aside, sound mix was good, camera work is on point, and some of the music is good. Plus Freeze's backstory from Batman TAS comes back, but that's all the positive comments I can give. Where the movie massively fails is trying to be a revival of the campy 60s TV show. George Clooney is not Adam West, and even though I liked Batman Forever, Clooney and Val Kilmer were the worst men to ever put on the cape and cowl. Chris 'O'Donnell is too angsty for my Robin. I mean I understand, he wants a moment in the limelight with Batman instead of being pushed to the side, but he comes off as an angsty teenager. Arnold Schwartzeneger makes for a horrible Mr. Freeze. I understand Schumacher wanted a chiseled man for the part, but Arney just isn't the man for the job, especially if his dialogue consists entirely of ice puns and cheapens the character, especially after a stunning revision in the animated series. Uma Thurman plays Poison Ivy and she's really over the top with the role, which some might find detracting, but she looked like she had fun. The writing is truly the film's biggest handicap. As I always say, you can have an all-star cast who've proved to be competent actors in other movies, but give them a crappy script and they'll suffer, even if they're doing their best to make it work, they're going to suffer greatly. That's the case here. The cast is already a mixed bag as I mentioned before, but with a godawful script, it's no wonder why some of the delivery is the way it is. Now all of this said and done, is this the worst comic movie ever? No, there are plenty of more obscure flops that make this look like a Christopher Nolan movie, but it is the worst Batman movie (Unless you count Catwoman). It's not the biggest cinematic abomination either, but if you take into account that another Batman movie wouldn't come for another 8 years and the fact the movie seemed to have killed light- hearted superhero films, they screwed up somewhere, but I reiterate, it's not the worst failed abortion, but it's still a failed abortion. Watch it with Rifftrax or watch it with friends and riff on it and you'll have the time of your life. Otherwise, unless you want proof that not all nostalgia is good nostalgia, don't watch this.

It's not the biggest cinematic abomination either, but if you take into account that another Batman movie wouldn't come for another 8 years and the fact the movie seemed to have killed light- hearted superhero films, they screwed up somewhere, but I reiterate, it's not the worst failed abortion, but it's still a failed abortion.

Starting off with Tim Burton's trademark dark vision which IMO worked perfect for Batman, mixing the Gothic style Burton is known for with a bit of humor without seeming totally over-the-top. Batman Returns took a darker turn bringing in Burton's stock character of a misfit wanting to be accepted by the fickle society he lives in, but it wasn't as successful, so Burton got the boot and enter Joel Schumacher. Batman Forever was a good popcorn flick, but the villain was weak, as it was basically just Jim Carrey cosplaying as the Riddler. With that out of the way, you may be expecting me to give Batman & Robin a verbal thrashing like many reviews that came before, but honestly, it's not as terrible as people make it out to be. Don't get me wrong, it earned its nasty reputation, but I want to be fair and praise the movie on what it did right. For instance, some of the special effects were good, rubber icicles aside, sound mix was good, camera work is on point, and some of the music is good. Plus Freeze's backstory from Batman TAS comes back, but that's all the positive comments I can give. Where the movie massively fails is trying to be a revival of the campy 60s TV show. George Clooney is not Adam West, and even though I liked Batman Forever, Clooney and Val Kilmer were the worst men to ever put on the cape and cowl. Chris 'O'Donnell is too angsty for my Robin.

Frank Capra's masterpiece It's A Wonderful Life is one of those beautiful masterpieces. It's difficult to make a normal review about a film such as this. It's rare that a masterpiece as great as this is shown to the world. Few characters and stories are as engaging as George Bailey (James Stewart) or his story. This movie deserves a commentary rather than an actual review. The movie gets everything right in telling this story. George Bailey gets an opportunity that would benefit every person who has ever lived- he gets to see what the world would have been like without him. George is the perfect character for this journey. He is the closest to being a real person out of every other character I've ever seen in cinema, even Rocky Balboa. George Bailey is full of love, kindness, and optimism, and he has dreams of going places and doing big things. However, he is unable to achieve these things, and gives them up to help his family and friends. We all can relate to this kind of disappointments, and they can make us all better people. And he is obviously disappointed when he makes these decisions, but he ultimately does the right thing. Then there comes a time where he is desperate. George is a good person, but he despairs when he has upset everyone he knows and is in danger of going out of business and going to jail. He is shattered, and decides to kill himself. George has been such an optimist the entire movie, that seeing him despair is truly disheartening, and yet it's believable when he falls apart because George is so human and capable of anger and sadness. But when his guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) shows him what the world would have been like without him, he thinks. He realizes how many people he's affected, how many lives he's touched. Because he loves people so much, seeing his loved ones not recognize him is terrifying. After this night, he learns how wonderful his life is, and how much he alone has touched so many others. This message and journey is more inspirational than those of any other movie I've ever seen. Jimmy Stewart is George Bailey. He plays this brilliantly written character with absolute conviction and love. Few actors have felt as real as Stewart. He talked like a real person when he acted. He stuttered like a real person, and didn't always think through what he said, just like a real person. He gives a chilling performance, one of the greatest in any film. George Bailey is It's A Wonderful Life, just as Rocky Balboa is Rocky. He is part of this amazing story, backed up by an outstanding supporting cast, including Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter (one of cinema's greatest and most despicable villains), and Henry Travers as Clarence.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"10 January 2014","score":"","review":" John Woo has certainly proved in Hollywood now that he has what it takes to be a top rate international action film director. The Killer is an early example that shows the maestro of mayhem and action at his very best. I really liked this film and I think it's one of John Woo's best films along with Hard Boiled. You get to see a vulnerable side to Chow Yun Fat's character as the hit-man Jeff who accidentally blinds a nightclub singer. What I liked was the way in which Woo showed that hit men are tortured souls doing a job that they don't always like doing and that there are so many emotions that they have to deal within in carrying out their job.

That's how I feel about ideas, to me their as real as the air we breathe, they are what drive us, keep us alive, and are capable of making differences in a person, people, a small or big portion of the world. This believe or not is my favorite film from Frank Capera.Like in most of his films there the kind that really speak to me and just give me a good feeling inside which I don't get nearly enough of which is part of what makes them timeless. You can also say this film is also kinda a Christian film since like most of his films have themes on selflessness as well as a Christian like protagonist whom like most have to endure a lot of hardship before triumph.I like the story, it's true it's kinda far fetched but I just rolled with it. To me like with most of Capra's films what really drove it are the characters and what they do.I really like the protagonist John Doe played well by Gary Cooper. You really do feel a heavy sense of pathos for the guy, because of how human he feels. At first when he takes this job on, he doing it for survival which is the money. Though I wouldn't say it's a totally selfish reason since he wanted that money to also help his friend. But also just simply as an opportunity for another chance, the guy isn't a bum as he stated he use to be a star ball player but as time went on has ran into hard times. But of course as he goes along with the role of playing a guy that doesn't really exist, as things grow he begins to realize the importance of what has been created as well as feel a sense of guilt over having to lie in order to retain hope for everyone but is still willing to admit the truth about himself. That I personally feel makes him a true hero and the real deal, willingness to revoke his title which shows he's not selfish but truly selfless.When we see John go though that as corrupt corporations rear their ugly head to destroy his character which they do, it just made me feel all the more pathos for him and hope he wins. He wasn't harming anyone but to some ideas are a threat because they evoke certain changes their selfish ambitions don't agree with. One really profound moments with John are the speech he gives the corporates which I thought was great, it says that people with ideas exist and it doesn't matter how many are struck down their will always be another or many.I even like the chemistry between both John and Ann Mitchell(Barbra Standwick) so this film is another one of the romance stories I like because they actually work. I thought it was believable because both had genuine interaction time, one of my favorite scenes is when John tells a story about his family to Ann which I found very touching because it shows that John truly does have a soul and isn't nobody. I even like the Ann character who is also human and whom was the one that created the whole John Doe phenomenon; her character I don't feel is a bad guy her head at first is just in the wrong place. At first when she created it it was simply for survival since she was being let go of, she needed a hot story fast to retain her career. Though I wouldn't say it was totally selfish since the paper she works for was going under so it was a way to keep them in business. But as the phenomenon grows she also grows a conscious about the whole thing realizes it's importance as well as ethical boundaries broken to keep it alive but the effect it would have on John which makes her concerned for his life. This just all the more makes us hope she might find some redemption for herself but also hope John can forgive her.To me the message is about ideas and dreams can never be destroyed, as long as good people, belief, and hope exists, ideas will always be fruitful and multiply.John Doe isn't a nobody, he is a somebody because he is everybody.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"10 January 2014","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" As Captain Sisko in Star Trek Deep Space Nine put it in an episode Beyond the Stars You can take away the story, but you can't destroy the idea, it exists in my mind, it's ancient knowledge, it's real.
