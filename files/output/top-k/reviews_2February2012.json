Well, regarding the box-office score, yes, the fourth opus of the Rocky series is the highest grossing and this is a fact. If it is the best is another matter. While this honor goes either to the opening or the concluding film in my opinion, it's not the worst either, and it carries a little charm getting more palpable after each viewing, granted you know you're not watching a film on the same caliber as Rocky, THE masterpiece.I think the 'charm' thing has to do with the cult status of the film, something that defines the 80's in such a flashy way, it's almost blinding. Rocky IV works as a kaleidoscope of all the cinematic stereotypes of the 80's, name one, you'll find it. First, by being (not another) sequel, the film incarnates one of the 80's most obvious trends, the necessary continuation of a money-making series. We forgive the musical montage since it's almost a trademark of the series, and Rocky IV's training montage is particularly well done, the sight of Rocky Balboa climbing the frozen peaks of Russian mountains is dizzyingly inspiring and one of the franchise's best shot. We have the one-dimensional antagonist, through Ivan Drago, furthermore from Soviet Russia, the greatest cinematic propaganda villains' providers before September Eleven. Drago defines the film's age and his evilness is defined by one of the cruelest movie deaths after Bambi's mom Apollo Creed. Rocky IV is infamous for being the one where the glorious and charismatic Apollo is killed, so Rocky can get on the ring and take good old revenge, the most overused plot device of the sport genre.I could go on and on about the movie clich√©s, but these are the most blatant ones, and I even forgive the speaking robot offered to Paulie for his birthday, it was the 80's, when we thought we would all be in flying cars in the 2000's. All the archetypal elements I defined don't ruin the film, but they create a huge gap in quality with what the first opus stood for, a movie beyond all the traditional representations. Rocky didn't need to win but to go the distance, Apollo was cocky but not evil, the montage was about building resistance not becoming a superhuman, and certainly not the revenge on a dead friend. Yes, I have a problem with Apollo's death, because it's so unlike the values incarnated by the series that it feels forced. I guess Stallone thought  Rocky needs a good reason to get back on the ring again then he thought of a terminator-like opponent, Dolph Lundgren as Drago, the pride of USSR, a powerful athlete training with the most modern equipment and not without use of steroids, USSR so he can challenge America (Cold War days). And who's the most openly American on the heavyweight competition? Bingo. Apollo gets in the rings to get out of it two feet ahead. We have our pivotal moment..To make it simpler, my problem with Rocky IV is that I started appreciating the film only after Apollo's death; the beginning was an artificially written build-up that doesn't match the quality of the rest of the film. And that's symptomatic of most of the sequels, they end up better than they started, I thought Adrian's coma and Rocky's struggle to find a job were too long in the second film, the training for Lang's fight in the third proved that obviously Rocky wasn't in the best shape to win, and the movie got better when Mickey died and Apollo trained Rocky. Rocky IV sins with the same problem of obviousness, we know Drago will destroy Apollo, Apollo's pretension is so blatant it's like he forgot that he was beaten two years in a row, you'd think it would have taught him a lesson of humility. Apollo didn't even have the 'eye of the tiger' because he acted like a caricature of the first Apollo, with the whole 'Living in America' parade, James Brown, stars and striped short. We're always ahead of the characters and know what would happen, Stallone with an Oscar nomination for writing proved to have a talent to come up with inventive ideas, but in the Rocky sequels, he always seem more inspired in the second acts, probably confident that the ending would redeem the flaws in the beginning..And he's not totally wrong, the Rocky films always have been about the ending, and the climactic fight, whose patriotically austere undertones contrasts with the flashiness of the first one, features probably one of the most painful to watch fights, yet awesome and entertaining. Rocky's journey in Russia becomes the reason to be of the film, and although the ending doesn't surprise us, it's handled with a positive message, here comes the 'we can change' speech, that sounds rather naive now, but doesn't deprive the film from a poignant humanistic value. I only wish it could have encouraged Stallone to write a less formulaic story, although it contains some unforgettable lines such as If he dies, he dies, Duke's repeated No pain catchphrase, the classic I must break you followed by probably one of my Top 10 lines from the film when Paulie tells Rocky Remember what I said back there about wanting to be you? Rocky nods, Paulies says Forget it. Apollo is no more with us, but thank God we have Paulie for the laughs, and Adrian for the heart.(On a last note, I always tried to point my finger on what the movie lacked besides the writing, and I remember that I always thought the movie featured the song The Final Countdown one of the most defining music of the 80's, I was disappointed not to hear the song in Rocky IV and I guess it would have been a huge contribution to the film, had it been used.)

Better to compare it to movies of the past few years, and even then it would stand out. It is a phenomenally good film, and perhaps even groundbreaking in its own way, since it goes against the trend of quirky, violent, sex-obsessed movie-making that's become so popular recently. We've finally been given a film with a good, almost mythic story, complicated yet believable characters, a masterful blend of emotional intensity and critical restraint, and a series of dance scenes that are authentic, inspiring and completely integral to the plot.No wonder critics have been falling over themselves in heaping praise on Billy Elliot. No wonder it's been holding its own in the box office despite being shown in a mere handful of theatres (one-quarter to one- sixth as many as the big Hollywood blockbusters) and despite its receiving hardly any promotion at the moment. Its success is being driven by word of mouth. And what is the word? Here is a movie that appeals to your heart, head, funny bone, eyes and ears, and last but not least your feet, for the music and the movement will have you wanting to get up and dance. And it achieves all of this without insulting the intelligence. I sometimes wonder how the movie would have been done by Hollywood Billy would have been made a more pathetic figure; the people in his life rendered more black and white; characters would have either remained caricatures, or made to develop in the blink of an eye. All such excesses are avoided in Billy Elliot, where the characters develop in a totally believable way, where Billy invites admiration instead of pity, and where the silences, looks and gestures all leave so much to the imagination. The dictum Less is more is clearly the guiding principle behind the film.The buzz for Billy has been so positive that people sometimes come away disappointed that their lives haven't been changed. So don't go expecting a knock 'em dead Hollywood roller-coaster. Billy Elliot is far more subtle, though the emotional moments are all the more powerful because of that. You can however believe everything that has been said of Jamie Bell. He has an outstanding screen presence and carries the movie on his little shoulders with breath-taking naturalism. His dancing is honest and powerful, and very masculine. He makes you forget that all the other actors give the performances of their careers in support. If the Oscar were awarded without consideration for age, career, box office draw or Hollywood clout, Jamie and his movie would win hands down.

Where the film goes wrong, I think, is in Barry Levinson's tone, who opts for a light and comedic approach to the potentially biting satire of the story.The plot revolves around a spin-doctor and Hollywood producer who team up to fake a war in order to distract the nation and get the President re-elected. This is a topic that is ripe for sharp social and political commentary and the script goes in that direction plenty of times, but I feel like the tone of the picture takes things far too easy on the potentially brilliant themes of it all. They go for comedy so often and I didn't even consider laughing once during the film, but instead was just hoping that there would be more dramatic scenes.With actors like Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro in the lead roles, the opportunity was right in their palms to make something edgy, intelligent and razor-sharp, but they just...didn't go for it. What came out was a lackluster comedy with no laughs. Hoffman adds more weight to his character than the rest of the film has going for it, imbuing his producer with a vanity and remorseful quality that is interesting to watch, but he only gets the opportunity to really do anything with it once (and it's easily the finest scene in the film).De Niro is someone I've never been a fan of, but I didn't mind him much here, mostly thanks to his chemistry with Hoffman.

Without a doubt you've heard of it, probably in the same sentence as 'scariest ever'. Almost 40 years later, it certainly has aged, but the terror is still there if you want it to be.At first, you'll wonder if this is the right film. The first scene, a long one, is in Iraq, following an unnamed archaeologist or something, digging up a little rock and looking at a statue. By the end it makes sense, and is actually quite relevant, but it's a very obtuse start. In fact nothing really happens until the 30 minute mark, but then it seems someone flips on the 'eerie' switch and it stays that way until the end. The Exorcist has a feeling to it that I have never felt, and it's impossible to describe. It's thoroughly unsettling.The main plot famously follows Regan MacNeil's possession, and a priest who questions his faith. They don't meet for a long time, but the whole film is just buildup for the ultimate confrontation. I bet this would be very rewarding on a second viewing. The characters and their portrayals are a mixed bag. Father Karras(Jason Miller) is excellent as the conflicted young priest who finds himself in over his head with Regan's occupant. He's an excellent character perfectly executed. The other priest, Merrin (Max von Sydow) has very few scenes, but like Hannibal Lecter 20 years later, is an example of quality over quantity. He speaks with his facial expressions, mostly hidden fear. He steals scenes, even if the character isn't as fleshed out as he should've been. Regan's mom Chris is a little shaky though. In some scenes she behaves very understandably, but in others she's very off, like when she receives news of a death. I loved Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream, but not so much here. The director and detective are both underdeveloped, and just sort of appear on screen without explanation.Lastly, the infamous Regan MacNeil(Linda Blair). While it's debated how much she actually acted, the character is amazing. Pure evil in the form of a little girl. That face appears whenever I blink today. If someone asked you who had the power in a room, two grown men or a tied down girl, you would say the men... unless you were watching The Exorcist. The horrifying things she does are so absolutely random and shocking, even today, mixed with that HORRIFYING voice, make one of the greatest villains ever on the screen.Much credit has to be given to the effects and makeup. I wondered how von Sydow hasn't aged in 40 years- he was around 40 when this was made. And Regan's makeup- yikes. But the little things make this, like little noises, and that creepy all-white face that appears from time to time to creep you out with being overly jumpy.What's the film about? I don't really know. The Exorcist certainly dwells on religion, or lack of, and with Regan's medical diagnosis, science versus faith. I think at its cold, empty center it is about true evil versus pure goodness. The Exorcist is an experience- mandatory viewing for all who care about film. It brings one of the best characters, a brilliant song, and a famous poster.

The film is directed by Tim Burton, and stars Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, Estella Warren, and includes a cameo appearance by Charlton Heston, star of the original Planet of the Apes from 1968. The film also includes a wonderful soundtrack by the talented Danny Elfman. The film has Tim Burton's thumbprint all over it with all the themes Burton typically uses in his films. Tim Burton insists that the film is not a remake, and has it's own original story. All the film does is use the same premise that the original Planet of the Apes did.THE STORY -It is the year 2029. A young man named Leo Davidson works on a United States Air Force space station called the Oberon. When a mission in space goes wrong, he crashes on a strange planet and finds himself in a world where intelligent and English-speaking humanoid Apes rule the world, and human beings are kept as slaves. The relationship between the two groups is very similar to the early relationship between White-Americans and Native-Americans and White-Americans and African-Americans. HOW THIS FILM COMPARES TO THE ORIGINAL PLANET OF THE APES FILMS -The original Planet of the Apes and the sequels that followed were full of political and social parables that both mirrored and responded to the many conflicts that were taking place in the United States of America during the years those films were released. What makes the 2001 Planet of the Apes reboot different then the original films are that the makers of the reboot took out the politics that was in the original series, and gave the audience a standard sci-fi action film of good vs. evil. The reboot does have an anti-racism theme, as well as a point that protests against general cruelty, but the reboot is fairly uncontroversial on the political level, not rocking the boat and not really challenging the mind that much. I also felt the original series had no villains or heroes - Just characters doing what they thought was right. Those films were not about telling you how to think. They were about telling you to think for yourself. The reboot however is very one-sided, and gives you the viewer a clear idea of who you're suppose to cheer for, and who you're suppose to be against. WHO I THINK WILL ENJOY THIS FILM - Kids. Boys for sure. The novelty of talking apes, the realistic make-up on the actors and actresses's playing the parts of the Apes, and the action\/adventure theme of the film will appeal to them. There is mild cursing, some violence, and a few scary scenes, but nothing too bad I don't think. The one scene that really sticks out the most to me that may scare younger viewers is a scene where the lead character discovers two dead bodies of Apes, but that was the extent of horror I saw in the film. A parent may need to consider watching the film first to decide. But I think boys 10 and up will be able to handle it, and I think this is one of those films that would serve as a great attention-getter for parents to use on their son(s) to watch while they do chores.People with a thing for Mark Wahlberg will enjoy the film I think as well, and people looking for solid and fun entertainment that doesn't make you think too much will also enjoy it. WHO I THINK WILL NOT ENJOY THIS FILM - Because the film is a straight-up good vs. evil film, some people may find the film to be too clich√© for them. Most hardcore fans of the original, and just remake\/reboot haters in general may not enjoy it because they won't be able to stop comparing it to the older films. And movie elitists won't be able to take a film about talking apes seriously, and will perceive it as a kid's film. MY THOUGHTS - I enjoyed this film, but it took a few times to get to that point. ) I really desired to enjoy the film because I loved the original series so much, but I had to stop comparing it to the older Apes films. The original Planet of the Apes is a classic, and very hard to beat. It's best to judge the reboot as it's own film. What also helped me enjoy the reboot more is I read the book that the film was based on, and was able to appreciate the film more since the book went into greater detail and explained what the character's thoughts and feelings were. Visually, this film is beautiful. It plays a big part in why I liked it. It also has several nods to the original Ape series. I loved the soundtrack by Danny Elfman as well. I felt his music summed up the emotions that many of the characters were feeling. All and all, the film is just a fun roller coaster kind of a film. What it lacks in some emotions, and deep thoughts, it makes up for with the visual effects, and serves as a great and fun summer blockbuster\/popcorn and soda\/live-action comic book\/time-filler film that I think is entertaining enough and will keep you entertained. Fully accept it for what it is, and if you can appreciate awesome visual effects and make-up in movies, you're in for a ride, and you'll have fun.

This is what a lot of those 'Working' people that politicians tend to smugly refer to them in the abstract are like, just struggling, trying to get by, a lot of Melvin Dunbarrs out there. And this is an interesting 'nobody\/loser' kind of guy, since he picks up an old bum one night who claims to be Howard Hughes, and then doesn't think much of it... until years later when, after the old codger dies, leaves 158 million dollars to him as one of his beneficiaries.

Melvin *should* be a jerk, but so much keeps getting thrown in his way, either by himself with his unfortunate purchases, or how he's treated by an a-hole boss at his work as a milk-man (and the bigger question - will he be Milkman of the Month?) The strategy in Bo Goldman's Oscar winning script is spot-on and reveals itself gradually there is a story here, but it's majorly a character piece, so that by the time the 'twist' arrives about Hughes' fortune and the controversy (based on fact) about this will, we've become invested with this likable lunk-head who is a lot of things but not a liar.It's a wonderful odd-ball duck of a movie, led along by some wacky country music that should work but does, and by Le Mat who finds the correct way to play this character and sticks with it (same with Steenburgen, who has the kind of spirit to make getting totally naked while quitting a stripping job very funny and kind of invigorating for the human spirit).

Something crazy happens that causes Marty to go back to 1955 in Doc's time machine and is stuck in 1955, and to make matters worse, the time machine is broken! On top of that, he stupidly alters his future and prevents HIS OWN BIRTH! Crazy huh? But, its up to Marty and Doc(played by Christopher Lloyd) to not only get Marty back to his present time, but to also fix the wrongs he has caused to his future! I will not spoil this movie because you must go see this magnificent piece of film-making! The performances in this movie were all fantastic! Especially the best villain in that movie Biff. He is a mean bully that picks on everyone and has the most hilarious lines in this movie!Well look at what we have here.

The story is actually not as complicated as people think. But, it does make your head spin of all the things going on in the movie! Its very consistent on switching to those scenes.

It was so packed that me and my two friends had to sit separately from one another because there simply were not enough seats. The movie did not disappoint. The Others was just subtle enough to lure you into a sense of security before it through another jump at you. The music was perfect because, in most mystery\/thriller types the music gives it away but in The Others you keep thinking that you know what you're getting and just when you're ready to call it a false alarm, something else comes out of the shadows. The kids are deliciously creepy and the servants make you wonder what secret the house and its occupants truly hold. I was particularly intrigued by the mute servant. Throughout the entire film I could not wait to hear what dreadful secret she possessed that would compel her to give up speech. Then the end came and I was so disappointed. Not only did the Sixth Sense literally just come out a few years before so the twist was completely played out, but the way they did it was so damn cheesy! Nicole Kidman is ripping up a piece of paper and then it cuts to a piece of paper ripping in midair in front of a s√©ance group. The effect was lame and lazy. The whole thing was lazy. Cool, I'm glad you realized you killed your kids (which was creepy, I'll give them that) but she probably still should have been alive. Or something, I don't know. All I know is that I was let down.

A friend, however, brought this film to my attention because he said he couldn't get the story out of his head, and made further comments that piqued my curiosity.Well, it didn't kill me to see the film and I'm happy to say that it was worth my time &#x96; for a number of reasons. First, the mise-en-scene is quite imaginative with absolutely surreal environments that I think owe a lot to the imagery of Monty Python; nothing wrong in copying &#x96; everybody does it, anyway.Second, it's a fairly simple story about the oppression and exploitation of the masses in a fantastic society somewhere in the cosmos. To that extent, it's an allegory for any situation that results in a clash between opposing cultures, different societies and so on. It's given a new slant here, though, by portraying humanity &#x96; called the Oms &#x96; as the oppressed who are exploited by blue giants, known as the Traag. The plot follows the exploits of one male Om who, after learning all about the Traag, escapes from them to rouse the other Oms to mount a rebellion.Finally, however, the most intriguing aspect about this film is the clear connection between it and other sci-fi and fantasy films. For example, the discordant sounds in this film are, I think, a direct copy of those I heard in The Forbidden Planet (1957). As noted already, the whole scenario owes much to the Monty Python TV series. And for sure, I think, James Cameron copied the idea of a giant tree sanctuary from this film for inclusion in his epic Avatar (2009). Cameron, of course, reversed the oppressed-oppressor roles of humanity and the blue giants for his story.Moreover, here's a way-out thought being a French production and seeing as how the French just love Hollywood westerns, I was amused to see the 'outlaw' Oms run for cover to a tiny hole in a wall &#x96; a long, blank, gigantic solid wall &#x96; much like how the real Butch Cassidy and his outlaws retreated to what was known as The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang hideout in the late nineteenth century. Too much of a stretch for you? Then think about why the writers here also included a Hollow Bush Gang of Oms who acted as enemies of the rebellious Oms in the Tree of Life sanctuary who wanted to escape from the Traag.Actually, I also think that The Hollow Bush Gang is a metaphor for the Gang with No Brains, as you will see &#x96; in contrast to the rebellious Oms who figured out how to escape from Traag domination. Knowledge, after all, is power and so forth...And, for something even more off the wall long ago, Edgar Rice Burroughs (famous for Tarzan and others) wrote sci-fi stories about Mars. In one of those stories, there were headless humanoids that could function only when a head slithered into position between the shoulders. So watch for a brazen copy of that idea in this film.I guess kids today would find the graphics and imagery quite rudimentary when compared to the current technology of mind-blowing CGI action. Too bad &#x96; their loss.If you ever come across it on TV or on DVD, you could do lot worse with a couple of your hours, I guess.

It follows the three girls as they escape the settlement and starts on the long journey home, and are hunted by the white men who are doing everything they can to bring the three girls back to the settlement. The plot is taking place in the year 1931.

This film does a good job of entertaining the viewer! The director has done a good job finding locations to film and placing the right music in the right place.

What is a little special about this film is that it manages to keep it interesting to watch without the Hollywood use of special effects, weird camera angels or other things that would be typical for a Hollywood-film.

But Casino, to me, is more in depth and gives a much more detailed look into the 'big' mobs, the ones that ran Vegas.The photography is great, especially the camera movement. The voice-over narration may be more than you heard in GoodFellas, but in a way it's necessary to get into the minds of Nicky and Ace. It's like a documentary and these guys are just giving us the facts. Not using a traditional film score also helps to make it feel more 'natural', the pop music selected to give exactly the right mood to its respective seen. Particularly the 'House of the Rising Sun' played towards the end over a sort of 'epilogue'.

I just watched Casino last night and I think I can say it is one of the best, most involving and well-directed films I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is great, De Niro and Pesci giving wonderful performances of 'Ace' and Nicky, respectively. I haven't seen Sharon Stone in any film before, but she also gave a great performance as Ace's wife Ginger.In a way, Casino is a companion piece to GoodFellas. However, it needs to be judged as a film in it's own right. GoodFellas is a great movie, one that almost anyone can enjoy. But Casino, to me, is more in depth and gives a much more detailed look into the 'big' mobs, the ones that ran Vegas.The photography is great, especially the camera movement. The voice-over narration may be more than you heard in GoodFellas, but in a way it's necessary to get into the minds of Nicky and Ace.

Man, was I wrong! The first time I watched it, I sat there as it ended, and I was just completely in a state of shock. This movie, more than any other movie I had seen on the subject of racism, really made me think twice about how I treated people of a different race. The way that Derek Vinyard's family was almost completely split apart and destroyed due to his racist beliefs should be a wake-up call to those people who have any racist beliefs whatsoever. I believe that this movie was a whole lot more than just a ground-breaking, controversial drama; it was a portrayal of exactly how much damage can be done to a family and a nation simply because of the hate for a person or people of a different color, for almost no reason at all. The Bible says that God created man in his own image. It also says to, Love your neighbor as yourself, which, right there, implies that racism is not something people should even consider. I wouldn't recommend that anyone under the age of 16 see this movie due to its graphic content and language; however, I believe that everyone who is over the age of 16, should see this movie at least once. This way, more people will get a chance to see the true consequences of racism, and how it can easily tear apart a family.

The film's lead, a man who has taken a fair few knocks in his time, looks on at those embracing the outer-shell without, it would seem, giving much of a thought to anything else. You wouldn't know that Joe, the titular lead, was once an embittered and thoroughly foul individual whose turning to drink had him become a bit of a monster without a scene in which he confirms such a thing. The film is about alcoholism, but not the descent into it as much as it is the tale of somebody who has been there; defeated it and then strives to hold it off again on the way back up. In a sense, the film adopts that of the complexion of something along the lines of Carlito's Way but does for addiction what said De Palma film did for crime whereas its veering away from the depiction of someone (usually a young person, or a collection of young people) getting caught up in drugs and drug addiction has it feel eminently more refreshing away from British fare of around the time in Trainspotting and Human Traffic or from across the Atlantic in Requiem for a Dream.That notion, harking back to those tourists and the distinction between what people can only see and what the reality of someone or something actually is, lies in Peter Mullan's Joe Kavanagh, a rough and ready individual who redecorates houses for a living; plays his football at weekends and sticks to the tried and tested items of leisure from his era, in the form of music from decades ago. The fact he was once the monster that he was becomes more apparent when we realise anyone in the world would far prefer him the way he is now compared to then, and yet brief descriptions of the man still has him sound like the sort of person most would cross the street if it meant avoiding walking past him. The film begins with a man's verbal confirmation of what an alcoholic is; the verbal closing of a particular chapter in his life and then a getting up and exiting of a room full of people to a round of applause from all involved. It is our Joe, and he has just attended his last alcoholic support group therapy session having been declared as to have defeated the condition and thus, free to go on living away from therapy attendance.Thus starts a 'beginning again'; a new chapter and a new lease of life beginning with this point, a line from Joe during a chess match with one of his many friends seeing him state that he has absolutley nothing and is generally on the bottom rung of whatever ladder encompasses this time and place. Hiding behind his quick wit and cynicism, Joe keeps male company that isn't necessarily of the most resounding sort, and sees him able to wind them up them by instigating a mock-police raid prior to knocking on the front door &#x96; their reactions of leaping out of windows and doing everything in their power to escape speaks volumes. They play football at weekends and shout and jeer and swear, they even steal brand new football kits from the rear of sports shops when it becomes apparent they need new ones as people unload the things from lorries. Throughout, Loach's style, indebted to cinema v√©rit√©, props up proceedings and compliments greatly the material throughout.At the core of the film is a relationship Joe finds himself in with a woman of his age named Sarah (Goodall), a social worker who operates with children that are under a great deal of strain thus coming across as someone adept at dealing with those of whom are a little problematic; a tad difficult to initially get to grips with and someone, we feel, with an enormous amount of patience in this regard &#x96; characteristics which bode well for her bond with Joe. While she doesn't understand, nor is particularly fond of, football and he doesn't go anywhere near the wine that she enjoys drinking with her dinner, these two come together and share something special which is introduced; developed and generally depicted with near effortless precision and finesse.Around at Joe's apartment for one evening, she observes a group of youths casually enjoying alcohol on a local green outside his window and we get a general sense that this is where Joe was as a young man. Their tryst is a pleasing addition to Joe's constant combating of veering too far back towards old habits, his relationship with Sarah the opportunity for redemption in maintaining a relationship with a woman after it is revealed what previously happened. There are, of course, events and people around the lead whom drag him ever closer back to his pits of despair and disaster; the crime genre aspect of the film as a young hothead struggles with an outstanding debt compliments, more-so sits unsettlingly, with the lighthearted and comedic strand following the fortunes of a hapless football eleven as well as the romance with Sarah. One cannot speak highly enough of this wondrous piece, an intelligent and well made film those of whom enjoy their drama grounded and adult and their characterisation rich and textured.
