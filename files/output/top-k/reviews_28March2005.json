Using voyeurism as its central theme, the film takes us into a fairly straightforward mystery that is well told but also laced with subtexts and other windows to stare through. To me this makes it a better film because there is much that intrigued me about the characters and the neighbourhood while also providing me with an engaging mystery. Modern audiences who have seen this film copied and referenced countless times will doubtless struggle to see what the fuss is about and perhaps they are right as the story doesn't have the twists and turns that are considered the norm now in a lot of thrillers; but it is still strong enough to keep the interest. The voyeuristic nature of the characters is interesting &#150; with them changing throughout the film; meanwhile the many lives on display in the other flats provide other things to be interested in as well.Of course a massive part of it working is the cast. Stewart plays his usual aw-shucks personae to good effect but crosses it with a certain lack of ethnics and a less than wholesome character who spends his nights with a young girl who he doesn't want to commit to and an unhealthy habit of staring at his neighbours. Kelly is sexually innocent and seductive with it &#150; unlike Hitchcock I tend to find blonde princesses all a bit dull and obvious but she worked here. Stealing most of her scenes is sterling support from Thelma Ritter, not that different a performance from some of her others but still very well timed and blessed with some really great lines. Burr is rather stiff but at a distance it doesn't really matter and he does well enough. The various other neighbours each works well with their mini-stories that barely exist within the film but do add to the layered effect of the film.Overall the film is classy and the rich colours and ordinary setting are nicely in contrast with the action of all the main characters. The mystery is well delivered and engages in a gently dramatic fashion while the starry cast are impressive and interesting throughout. For my money not as pound-for-pound entertaining as North by Northwest but still one of Hitchcock's more widely accessible films if not quite one of his best.

It didn't take much more than a few weeks before we decided to see it, and from the moment we put it on, we didn't regret the decision one bit. This film currently holds the record as the best war movie I've seen(before held by titles as Full Metal Jacket, and after that, All is Quiet on the Western Front). It's by far the most realistic and intense war movie I've ever seen, and up there as one of the most effective. Contrary to what I had expected, the better part of the movie is action and intensity. I was under the impression that most of it would be build-up and there would be one or two relatively short war scenes near the end. Or worse, half the movie would be the general and colonels talking about how to get out of the situation. Instead, most of the film is action, and almost all of it is realistic, too. This perfectly illustrates how intense and chaotic warfare is, particularly urban fighting. While this doesn't have the beautiful symbolism and strong message of All is Quiet on the Western Front, it does have the more accurate and disturbing portrayal of war. The plot is good, and apparently mostly true(though I don't know how much is shortened and such to make for more dramatic sequences at the cost of realism). The pacing is incredible. Never before have I seen so long and yet so captivating film. Even more so than The Godfather, I was glued to my seat, barely ever even glancing at my watch. The high level of intensity is kept through pretty much the entire film, from the beginning of the war-scenes that take up almost all of the film. The excellent editing and cinematography also contributes to this. The acting was great. The characters are well-written, though I suppose there are a bit too many to keep track of(though this is because we are introduced to all of those who played an important part at this battle), and not all of them get enough character development or screen-time. The effects and action are fantastic. Amazingly accurate to the real thing, as well. The details, however, are what make the film the nearly perfect piece of war film history that it is; you'll see so many things in this that happen in real life war that are usually overlooked or ironed out, for the people supporting war to keep face. Friendly fire, underrating the strength of your enemies, ignoring a blind angle for even a second... however, the film also has a sour aftertaste of Hollywood and mainstream film to it. This film isn't completely free of the ever-popular and completely ludicrous slow-motion shot of the heroic soldier running from one point to another, while under fire of several automatic weapons at much too close range, and coming through without a scratch. It doesn't hold true, it doesn't happen in the real world, face it. Near the end there is also a dramatic silence, despite the ease with which the enemy could attack our heroes... again, most likely done for effect, rather than realism. There's not much of it, but it still hurts the experience far more than it adds to it. I didn't see this film to see heroic, American soldiers do impossible feats; I saw it to see what by many is being referred to as the most realistic war film ever made. In the end, this still stands as at least one of the best war movies out there, despite some shortcomings. I recommend this to just about anyone who can stand the violence in it, which is quite uncompromising and real. If you're able to see this, and you're not deterred by the reasonably high level of graphic violence, you really should watch it. 8\/10 ","genre":"Drama, History, War"},{"date":"28 March 2005","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" After having taped this film off TV, me and my father(who is about as anti-war as you can get, partially due to having a little experience as a soldier) talked about seeing this at some point.

Forget the reviews of the critics who seem to love bashing films, this is a tremendous, epic film with such a great heart that explores the values and meaning of humanity and life in general. I saw it for the first time in ages today and its still as touching as the first time I saw it a few years ago. In fact I remember it being shown on a plane I was on the year it came out and I watched the first 5 minutes on a screen with poor picture and sound and remember thinking it was just cheesy family comedy which just plays for humor and nothing else. When I first saw it a few years later when there was nothing else on I was completely blown away by it. It was the complete opposite of what I was thought it was originally. This film does have its humor and that humor is often hilarious in parts, but thats because its delivered so brilliantly by Williams who plays his character to perfection. More importantly it is not supposed to be a comedy. Its a drama and features brilliant performances from an underrated cast including Williams, Sam Neill, Embeth Davditz and Oliver Platt among others.The film is also outstanding from a technical perspective. The futuristic cities, buildings and vehicles look fabulous along with the new household appliances, but the most important thing that really steals the show is the Script and Direction from Kazan and Columbus respectively. I will certainly be watching more of Kazan's films in the future and already thought he did a great job on Matilda beforehand. I've always been an admirer of Columbus and this has to be his best film to date. His vision of the film is splendid and I applaud him for bringing such a brilliant set of actors and sets together to make such an epic and unforgettable film.For most of my reviews for films, I don't like commenting too much on the plot, but here I feel the need to because it touched me so much and the plot helps explain why this happened. It is about a Robot that over 200 years, learns about humanity and seeks to be a part of it. At the beginning its more of a comedy as the robot (who's called Andrew) gets used to the way humans are and learns about simple well known things in life i.e Laughter, Sex, Family Life and Change. But further on as he becomes close to the youngest in the family, he learns more about love and how life is. I sympathised with him as he has to witness this and we follow him as he experiences the deaths of the people closest to him. I felt for him due to him being unable to experience these things like we do. Throughout the film I felt (although the critics certainly didn't and many here probably don't) all these things and became closer and closer to him as he constantly never gives up hope on becoming a human. I found it very emotional and I actually appreciated many of my abilities that I as a human have. To love, to cry, to experience changes, to reproduce, watch my children to grow up, to get older and to eventually move onto another life. As Andrew learns about all these things and begins to want them I really did feel for him like I say because I would find it incredibly hard to live if I was like that.SPOILER Having witnessed the ups and downs of Andrew's life throughout the film and his epic journey to finally become a human being, by the end of the film Andrew has managed to fully achieve this. He is fully human and unfortunately misses this declaration by a few seconds. But he didn't need to like his lover Porscha (His closest family member's granddaughter) says. He has done it. He has found the love he's wanted all those many years with her and he won't have to experience the sadness of watching things change ever again. He has moved onto another life like we're all destined to do and Porscha decides to join him. END OF SPOILERBasically, after seeing this film I did learn just how lucky I am to possess all these extraordinary and unique abilities and I don't believe it is just an accident or coincidence. We each have a destiny and I believe God wants us all to experience these things in life and I'm grateful to be here today and will certainly not be taking any of them for granted.I really think that that this film with a rating of just 6.1 and with the harsh and very unfair criticism its got from critics has to be the most underrated misunderstood film ever made. The film is not really in my opinion a family comedy although it unfortunately has been marketed that way. Its a drama about humanity with bits of comedy that should be watched by anyone of any age. I believe it can help people to become, like me, much more grateful for things we as humans perhaps take for granted in life.I thank you for reading this review and advise you to watch this film and prepare to be moved in a way I don't think any film has done or ever could do.10\/10 Not my favourite film of all time but certainly in my Top 5.

To love, to cry, to experience changes, to reproduce, watch my children to grow up, to get older and to eventually move onto another life. As Andrew learns about all these things and begins to want them I really did feel for him like I say because I would find it incredibly hard to live if I was like that.SPOILER Having witnessed the ups and downs of Andrew's life throughout the film and his epic journey to finally become a human being, by the end of the film Andrew has managed to fully achieve this. He is fully human and unfortunately misses this declaration by a few seconds. But he didn't need to like his lover Porscha (His closest family member's granddaughter) says. He has done it. He has found the love he's wanted all those many years with her and he won't have to experience the sadness of watching things change ever again. He has moved onto another life like we're all destined to do and Porscha decides to join him. END OF SPOILERBasically, after seeing this film I did learn just how lucky I am to possess all these extraordinary and unique abilities and I don't believe it is just an accident or coincidence. We each have a destiny and I believe God wants us all to experience these things in life and I'm grateful to be here today and will certainly not be taking any of them for granted.I really think that that this film with a rating of just 6.1 and with the harsh and very unfair criticism its got from critics has to be the most underrated misunderstood film ever made. The film is not really in my opinion a family comedy although it unfortunately has been marketed that way. Its a drama about humanity with bits of comedy that should be watched by anyone of any age. I believe it can help people to become, like me, much more grateful for things we as humans perhaps take for granted in life.I thank you for reading this review and advise you to watch this film and prepare to be moved in a way I don't think any film has done or ever could do.10\/10 Not my favourite film of all time but certainly in my Top 5.

However, the more the story unfolds we are banged over the head with numerous names, situations and too much narration that really isn't necessary to follow the story.There are other problems, especially regarding the Nicky Santoro character, played by Joe Pesci. There are conflicting information about him all through the movie. Was he a major figure in organized crime or was he simply a two-bit hood. It is never quite made clear but he must have had some connection since he gets in any casino before he is banned. The friendship between him and Ace is never really fully explored either. A background sequence could have saved the viewer a lot of confusion. As they are portrayed in this movie they don't even seem to be of the same species. The way Rothstein tries to cover up where he comes from is essential to the plot but that he behaves a lot more like a socialite than a gambler is too polished to be believable.The Sharon Stone character Ginger is the most fully developed person in the movie. Her character is pretty much revealed in the first two minutes she's on screen and the way she transforms during the movie is also believable. Even though her pimp, Lester (played by James Woods) doesn't have a lot of screen time, we can guess what purpose he had in her life. Therefore, it must have been hard to cast the Ginger role as her's requires a great deal of acting skill.Like so many actors Scorsese has worked with before, De Niro, Pesci and Frank Vincent does pretty much what we expect.

It's rare for a film to combine these elements properly, and many have failed at it, but through it's efficient pace and competent piecing together, Mississippi Burning achieves it's aim admirably. Mississippi Burning is a very professionally handled film and credit for that has to go to the director, who has a habit of putting together very professionally made films. The influence that this film has had on later crime investigation films such as the magnificent 'LA Confidential' is evident throughout, and that adds yet more credibility to the proceedings. In spite of it's turbulent plot, Alan Parker never sets out directly to shock the audience, and despite several scenes of violence, it's always the film's plot that takes centre stage and Alan Parker doesn't stray from that as many other directors have done. This film doesn't need to shock and offend to get it's message across.The plot follows the disappearance of three men - two of them white Jews and the other a young black man. We then follow the fortunes of two FBI men that come into town to investigate the disappearance. The acting in the movie is strong throughout, with William Dafoe and Gene Hackman heading a strong cast. The two stars do a great job of drawing the audience into the movie, and the two shine throughout. They are joined by a host of lesser-known stars, such as Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky and a great little turn from Michael Rooker as a racist KKK member. The themes that are implemented into the plot are impressively portrayed, with the social study being the most prominent of them. Mississippi Burning adequately denounces hatred, and does a great job of getting across the stupidity and pointlessness of it. The film is also notable for a great atmosphere throughout, which is matched by a great soundtrack that creates a very foreboding and tension filled feeling. My only real criticism of the movie is due to it's ending, which goes on a bit and kills the atmosphere that the film has done such a good job of creating.

Luckily this woman happens to be a dresser at one of the big shows in town and, while stripping to pay the rent, Nomi gets to meet the movers and (literally) shakers within the business. It is not long before she starts to get some breaks and things look like working out for her; however, can she survive among the betrayal, bitchiness and excesses and keep her naïve, down to earth spirit? Ermmmm &#150; no, no she can't.How easy it would be for me to throw my hands up and attack all the easy targets in this messy shambles of a film; but I want to be fair to it.

Rowling, so I can't really say how this movie compares with it.So, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is left to grow with his eeeevil aunt (Fiona Shaw) and uncle (Richard Griffits). They make harry do all the chores, while they pamper their own son. But Harry is not an ordinary boy he's a wizard and he's been accepted at wizard school of Hogwarts. So of to school we go.

Not great, but still entertaining. If you watch it together with Mad Max I and II, it becomes an annoying movie full of plot holes.Some examples 1. What happened with the gyro captain? In Mad Max 2 the road warrior, the gyro captain with his helicopter eventually teamed up with Max and ended up leading the small colony of the compound toward a new civilization. In Mad Max 3 he still has a flying machine, but this time he has a son, he lives in some kind of house-hole in the desert, and robs Mad Max from all his belongings. He and Max don't seem to have met before neither. Is this a different character than the gyro captain? Is this the same character? He's certainly played by the same actor and he still has a flying machine. This doesn't make any sense at all.2. In the Road Warrior, Mad Max's car (the last V8-interceptor) was completely blown to pieces. In Mad Max 3, this car miraclously reincarnates, and even contains exactly the same boobytrap. Or maybe he bought a new one??? How many 'last of the V8 interceptors' can there be? Too bad his dog, who died in the Road Warrior, didn't reincarnate as well. 3. What happened to civilization? In Mad Max I, Max even watched television at one point. Civilization was in decay and anarchy was rising, but infrastructure was still okay. There were hospitals, restaurants, night clubs, ambulances, newsreporters, etc&#133; Okay, at the end of the first movie Max wanders into the waste land, leaving this civilization behind. But what happened to it? Has everything turned into wasteland? Are there some pieces of traditional society left, thousands of miles away from where the action in the story takes place (as suggested in the Road Warrior)? It is okay not to explain everything, and you can leave a lot to the imagination of the viewer, but some logic,some suggestions and clues might be in its place. 4. In this movie it is suggested that Max was a cop before some kind of apocalypse took place. The first mad max movie however, where Max was a cop, was already set after the decay has begun and after some kind of war. Or maybe a second nuclear war (this movie refers to water contaminated by radio-activity) or another world war took place after the events in the first Mad Max movie? Or not? How do the children from the planecrash fit in this story?Sometimes it tends to be a sequel (at one point the movie refers clearly to the history of Max and the personal drama that struck him in Mad Max I) sometimes it tends to be some kind of remake of Mad Max II the Road Warrior (recapturing some of the same dialogue, a kind of gyro captain, a settlement in the middle of nowhere), sometimes it tends to be another movie with new characters played by the same actors (a bit like Sergio Leone's spaghetti-westerns with Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef), with the exception of Mad Max who's still Mad Max. It seems to be a bit of everything, so in the end it doesn't make any sense at all. Moreover, this movie seems to be directed by two different directors. The first half of the movie still contains the raw, dark, nihilistic atmosphere of the Road Warrior (with a great action sequence in the Thunderdome), the second half seems to be directed by somebody who had a new Peter Pan movie in mind. It is okay to give the story an optimistic twist after the first two movies (there is still a light at the end of the tunnel), but ending the trilogy with an hour long children from Neverland against captain hook and his pirates ... that's just stupid.Not for fans of Mad Max I and II.

His car breaks down and the only option that he has is to leave the main road and to go to a small, dusty town called Superior. In this town live all kind of weird people. A blind Indian who doesn't do much else but drinking Dr. Pepper on a bench, next to his dead dog; a dumb garage owner; a young macho, called T.N.T, who seems to come straight from the fifties and his nymphomaniac girlfriend... Bobby Cooper wants to get out of there as quickly as possible. But he has one problem. He's got no money because he was robbed and the mechanic charges him an enormous price for the repairs. He can't do anything else but to stay in the village, to try to live with these weird people and to stay out of the hands of the bookies until he has found some money...I must say that I was quite surprised by this movie. The way everything was shot is really well done and the music (composed and selected by Ennio Morricone) gives it all an extra touch. Even all the acting was very convincing. With people like Sean Penn, Billy Bob Thornton, Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte I don't expect anything less than a good performance. But it has to be said Jennifer Lopez, who certainly isn't a great actress, was actually pretty good in this movie.All in all this is a very good movie, plenty of dark humor, good acting and some very nice shots.
