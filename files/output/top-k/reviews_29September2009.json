But with a rare night off work and nothing else on TV, my Better Half and I settled down to watch this strangely old-fashioned but contemporary heist thriller. It might not offer anything new to the mix and is even slightly silly at times but it's perfectly acceptable TV fare, which may explain why it gets shown so often.Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Gin Baker, an insurance worker who investigates art thefts. After a priceless Rembrandt is stolen, Gin is sent after the prime suspect, legendary thief Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery) but like all heist movies, nothing is as it seems. It turns out that Gin is an accomplished thief herself and she needs Mac's help to pull off a massive job on the eve of the Millennium. The question is, who's playing who? Like most heist movies, Entrapment is a film that wants to be very cool and tries too hard. True, it doesn't bother with irritating split-screens and flashbacks like Duplicity but like that film, it bases the whole film around the two leads. Zeta-Jones and Connery aren't exactly newcomers yet they simply don't gel as a couple - the age difference doesn't help but neither character struck me as being particularly appealing. None of it felt believable from the rightly mocked heist sequence itself to the clunky dialogue. Even the ending felt far too convenient and dare I say it, predictable. In fact, what made Entrapment entertaining was reminding me of all the pre-Millennium fears that were voiced in the days and weeks before Y2K. But when the credits rolled, I didn't feel involved at all and if a heist movie has to make any impact at all, the very least I should feel is challenged.Like I said, this is perfectly acceptable to watch on TV because at least you're not paying for it. But had I splashed out on a DVD or seen it at the cinema then I might have felt short-changed. Entrapment could have been much better than it was but by trying too hard, it ends up falling flat on its face. It also hasn't aged well due to the complete lack of chaos everyone predicted that was Y2K. For once, I'd like to see a heist movie where every character isn't double-crossing each other, where the ending isn't ambivalent and that doesn't involve the whole one last job routine we've all watched hundreds of times before. Entrapment, sadly, isn't the movie I've been waiting for.

Chuck's cop buddies already killed the guy days before! & even worse, thanks to the usual sneaky scientist types you usually see in films like this, he has now been made virtually indestructible, meaning he can be stabbed & shot at only for his wounds to heal in seconds (Kind of makes you wonder why these guys are allowed to be scientists in the first place, when you consider how smart these guys are, I mean which smart scientist would want to make an unhinged bloodthirsty maniac super invincible to begin with?!) Now after killing off those that attempted to pull the plug on him for good, the maniac sets his sights on The Sheriff's girlfriend & the Sheriff learns to his horror that this time not only will he may not be able to kill this guy, but he & is girlfriend may wind up as yet two more victims on his grisly resume. SILENT RAGE is a film I heard about some 10, 12 years ago when I stumbled upon a review of it in an old movie review book, the plot sounded pretty neat & I never knew action star Norris had done a Sci-fi\/ Horror\/Action film prior to that, so I was interested in seeing it, but could never find a copy until lately, when I stumbled upon an old VHS copy of the film & decided to watch it & while the film is a cut above most horror combos that were being made at the time (& far outshines pretty much any horror film being made currently) I still felt a little disappointed by the time the credits rolled. The acting & directing is very well handled here & there are a few tight suspense sequences on hand, to keep you on the edge of your seat, however the film is far to chatty at times & has the usual clich√© characters you would come to expect from this type of film, a fat dumb deputy, tough, bad to the bone bikers, sneaky scientists & the not so sneaky one who realizes the whole experiment is a mistake to begin with, the cheesy subplot where two lead characters who were once in love are trying to sort out their differences etc. & that's exactly the problem, after the suspenseful opening ten minutes, the film slows down until about midway, with far to many scenes where Norris & his former girlfriend try to work out their problems & the unneeded subplot where Norris & the Deputy must deal with some bad guy bikers who plan on tearing up his town, unneeded because the plot point adds nothing to the movie & could have been written out of the script, & the element of regeneration, although boasting many interesting ideas, is handled quite awkwardly & when the Killer does spring back to life the film is almost over & many scenes that could have been suspenseful is ruined since the film cries out for a musical score, adding that something special to the film, heck even the finale between Norris & the psycho would have really benefited from a great music score, yet when there should be music in many of the attack scenes there's none! another problem that no doubt stopped me from enjoying this movie a little more than I should have was this, thanks to the moron in the movie text who reviewed it, he totally gave away the ending to the movie which dampened any possible suspense there might have been in the finale. Though I highly doubt weather I learnt of the ending before hand or not would have made the ending more suspenseful, since the final confrontation is poorly executed, at least in terms of the unexciting fightNorris & the killer has & what's worse, Norris sees this guy lit on fire & shot at countless times & heck even falls out a top story window, & get back up alive, moving just as good as always, yet he thinks dumping this vicious psycho down the well is going to kill him?! In fact the ending seemed like it was laying the groundwork for a larger future scenario for a sequel that fortunately (or unfortunately, whichever way you want to look at it) never materialized.

Rambo First Blood Part II takes Rambo back to the jungles of Vietnam, where most of the mental traumas that dog him began. His mission is to search for missing POWs, instead he falls right back into a war that, for him, has never really ended.As I said, the action in this film goes way beyond anything we saw in the first one (but with James Cameron as one of the screenplay writers, that's not exactly a surprise). Less content to let the personal and political dramas propel the action, this film is pretty much the reverse, with the action being cause to create those plot developments. In many way, this film seems to forget the humanity shown in the original and opts to let the excitement of the moment wash over you, like the backwash of an F-16 fighter jet, as the explosive battle sequences blast you against the back wall. Although, while extremely over the top in almost every stunt and fight, to the point ungodly suspension of disbelief is pretty much the order of the day, it is a beautifully choreographed bloodbath to behold. It basically, for good or ill, set the stage for what the 80's action epic would be expected to achieve for the rest of the decade.While not exactly a deeply emotive character in the first film, Sly gets even less moments here. There is no understanding to what Rambo is feeling being back in the place that has tortured him so. There is almost no attempt to play on those feelings at all, save an all-too-brief scene on a boat, between Rambo and the young Vietnamese woman (played by Julia Nickson) who is helping him in the mission, but that's as far as they go to give you any idea on what Rambo is thinking and feeling, being back in 'Nam after all this time. I would have liked to get into Rambo's thoughts more, as the traumas he'd suffered there could have added even more depth to an emotionally complex character. But that simply isn't what this film was about.Richard Crenna reprises his role, as Rambo's C.O., but he gets very little to do in this film. Whereas in the first he was a key to understanding Rambo and used to contrast the political themes that were presented, here he is merely a very small cog, used mainly to set up the plot to get Rambo back into action. He does have one very intense scene, where he argues with the slimy Washington bureaucrat (played by Charles Napier), which brought back a momentary flair from the first film, but it is over quickly, as the need to get back to the jungle slaughter is the paramount concern here.Rambo First Blood Part II was less the ending of an iconic character's saga (not the least of which is due to the fact two more sequels were made) and more the start of replacing character-driven action, with action-driven drama. It created a new standard for what action films could be (and in many cases, would be) from that point on. It set up a game of constant oneupmanship with the other action stars of the day, as they all attempted to outdo what this film began. In some ways, this film is almost a whole new entity, completely separate from the original film in every thing but the characters names, yet it is also strangely completely bound to it. As a sequel to a film that had some very deep philosophical and political themes, this film fails to recapture almost any of that same spirit, but in terms of spinning the action film genre into an ever growing and testosterone-fueled behemoth, determined to make the impossible seem probable, as well as solidifying Rambo's status as an 80's icon for all-time, the film succeeds on a level no other film could ever hope to manage.

As a sequel to a film that had some very deep philosophical and political themes, this film fails to recapture almost any of that same spirit, but in terms of spinning the action film genre into an ever growing and testosterone-fueled behemoth, determined to make the impossible seem probable, as well as solidifying Rambo's status as an 80's icon for all-time, the film succeeds on a level no other film could ever hope to manage. This is truly the film that epitomizes the phrase, check your brain at the door and enjoy! Which I am more than able to do.

Compared to epic Hollywood movies that have been made before and since, the strength of 'Lawrence of Arabia' is that the film's heart lies in its story and character rather than lavish sets, action scenes or special effects. That is not to say that this movie was lacking in the aforementioned department. Quite the contrary because Lean has used a lot of rawness and subtlety. The desert is so wonderfully captured that it is successfully portrayed as ruthless and yet seductive. The viewer can understand why Lawrence is drawn towards it. During the action sequences, the camera would shift back to the characters' faces allowing the viewer to see their emotional reaction to the ongoing horror rather than merely showing 'cool action scenes'. Beautifully shot and edited and thanks to a solid screenplay, 'Lawrence of Arabia' follows a very smooth pace and even though the running time is more than 4 hours long, there was not a moment when I felt that it dragged. The soundtrack is mesmerizing. However, what would have 'Lawrence of Arabia' been without the immensely talented Peter O'Toole? I was very surprised to discover that this was his first film. Whether it's his spontaneous reaction, impressive improvisation, or terrific dialogue delivery. The actor plays the part very naturally. There is not one scene where he acts formulaic or theatrical (a risk many actors ran into those days, especially with such roles). It is a prototype performance that portrays a heroic character as very human. Of the supporting cast, Omar Sharif is very likable as Sheriff and Anthony Quinn provides some comic relief. The rest of the actors do fairly well. Only Alec Guinness's portrayal of Prince Feisal falls flat.Overall, 'Lawrence of Arabia' can be described as a one-man show because of Peter O'Toole, but then that would be unfair to David Lean and Robert Bolt as this also marks their best work (or at least one of their best works) to date. This is truly a unique epic film experience and there is hardly any other picture of its genre that has achieved remotely close to what 'Lawrence of Arabia' has.

One era of films I never really dabbled in was anything before the mid 1940's. Bringing Up Baby was made in 1938 and stars two of Hollywood's greatest actors, well, at least that is what I have always been told. Katharine Hepburn is always praised for her amazing acting, and this being a screwball comedy, I feel that I don't get a chance to see her shine. I have not seen much of her work, but I am willing to. I just didn't feel that this was a good vehicle for me to be introduced to her. Carey Grant on the other hand was wonderful. Prior to seeing this I was told that he and director Howard Hawks were very close and Grant would try anything for him in his films. Knowing this I payed close attention to Grants performance and was glad that I did. His facial expressions and reactions to the situations he was in were great. Besides the two of them the plot was somewhat solid but to plain for my taste. The older films have a lack of what I am used to, and because I was not familiar with more of them until now, I feel I am set in my ways and need to get out of them if I can. There is a lot of silence in the film, due to a minimal musical score and sound effects, and at times the actors seem to be talking way too fast, probably because it was a screwball comedy. Now I had seen Preston Sturges Sullivan's Travels a few years ago and loved it. I want to now go back and re-watch it so I can compare the two films as screwballs.

It is also, perhaps more importantly, a look at the misuse of government power in a democratic society and those willing to expose it.The film features what can be called a perfect cast. Jean-Louis Trintignant is the Examining Magistrate, the government official who is supposed to sign off on the police's version of events but discovers the truth is much different. Then there's the officials involved including Pierre Dux as chief of police and Julien Guiomar as his deputy who both give fine performances as men in power who become increasingly desperate to close the case. There are those directly involved in the assassination such as Renato Salvatori and Marcel Bozzuffi who convincingly play ordinary people who political beliefs and the power of public officials lead them to commit the assassination. Last but not least are Yves Montand as the Deputy (aka Gregoris Lambrakis) and Irene Papas as his wife, both of whom use their rather limited screen time to great effect. There really didn't seem to be a single miscast part which is an incredible rarity and something that makes the film even better.This brings us to the production values of Z.

Perhaps as a consequence of that there seems to be very few sets in the film which helps even more to give a sense of verisimilitude to the entire film. The film also replays the assassination several times after showing it to the viewer in its entirety to show how points of view and ulterior motives can affect views of an event (something echoed by Oliver Stone in his 1991 film JFK). The film's editing allows the action of the film's first half to be a bit more drawn out as it paints a portrait of the events leading up to the rally where the assassination takes place yet allowing for it to have the pace of a thriller when the investigation of the Examining Magistrate begins, allowing for flashbacks from different witnesses. The result of all this is a film that seems very realistic, slowly paced at times and yet tightly paced when it needs to be.Then there is the script of course. The script written by Jorge Sempr√∫n and director Costa-Gavras, is a casebook example of how a real-life vent should be transposed to the silver screen as it condenses a significant amount of time down to two hours without confusing the viewer or being tedious. The script also pulls no punches with its views of the right wing government of Greece at the time (though the country is unnamed in the film) starting with appears at first to be a lecture about agricultural policy that leads into a rant about the government's wanting to destroy the mildew of the mind i.e. everything to the left of it politically. From there the script shows how officials how officials allowed the assassination to happen and how they then tried to hide their involvement as quickly as possible. The script shows even those not involved, under pressure or by being complacent, try to stall the investigations of the man charged with finding the truth (the Examining Magistrate). Considering when the film came out and the events in the years preceding it is hard to see why it was so successful here in the U.S. and why it continues to have strong resonance today (especially considering that the assassinations of Lambrakis and JFK were a mere six months apart).

The script is above all a demonstration of misuse of government power, the lengths it will go to cover its own tracks and those who are willing to expose it.Z is many things. It is a true story told like a thriller that shows how a historical event would be put on the screen. It is a fine film that is well acted by a perfect cast all of whom are backed by good production values, fine editing and a script that pulls no punches. Above all though I believer it is a warning. To whom is it a warning? To those who say that something like this can't happen in a democratic society because in 1963 it happened there.

Time is money, and success is everything. Anything else is second to that, even his girlfriend. Even his own personal life. She gets sick of it and leaves, but not before an overstressed Nelson manages to get fired. But then he has just met Sara. Sara is a down to earth, seemingly crazy girl with an odd set of rules. She just wants one month, to wake him up. To save him. But time is the one thing that is most difficult to give.Comments This is a movie that really leapt on me. Or mostly it was Theron's character Sara that enthralled me. Such warmth, such joy de vivre is rarely seen and even more seldom actually felt coming across the screen. And, like Nelson, I find her totally captivating. She really is this movie.Keanu Reeves are more limited with emotions and do not come across the screen as well as Theron do. But for one he and his character is not supposed to, not until the end at least and he does warm up considerably. He also does provide a nice and almost needed contrast to Sara, as another character like her would be too much.Also well worth mentioning is Jason Isaacs that are really impressive in an odd but interesting supporting character.I find it surprising that this movie wasn't considered for any more awards than the Razzie. Especially Theron's acting was impressive, and she certainly didn't deserve a Worst Actress Nomination.If you haven't figured it out already I really like this movie. It was a movie that managed to captivate me. It was so full of emotion it was hard to resist. Also there is something mysterious and secret behind Sara's fa√ßade, and it is almost impossible not to come to care for this woman. In addition to finding out how the relation between Sara and Nelson developed (but that almost came to be secondary), I really wanted to know her secret.I think this is a movie that should be seen with a certain someone. With all the emotions flowing, some really nice scenes and a really fitting soundtrack it is almost perfect for a nice evening at home, just the two of you.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 September 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Recap Nelson, a man in the fast lane, highly talented advertising consultant and workaholic to boot.

Maybe what I like so much is that Mulan is not waiting for her prince to come or any damsel in distress deal, but she is an intelligent woman held down by her society. The story Mulan's father is old but he is called to war. He will probably die. Mulan decides to take his place. This is remarkably unselfish because if she's discovered she will be killed. This shows how much she loves her dear old dad. You just have to see the movie to appreciate it. The songs are amazing (I'll make a man out of you Donny Osmond's voice is fantastic). The extra features were also pretty good. I found I'll make a man out of you in all different languages very interesting. The animation is great as it shows a lot of the natural beauty of China. So make sure you don't miss one of Disney's greatest(and probably last judging by the way Disney is going down the drain) animated movies. There is a strong message for us all when watching Mulan. The main character, Mulan, represents the cluminess in all of us. She tries very hard to please her parents but always seems to come up short from their expectations until the time is right. I know it was like that for me growing up and for a lot of people i know. Having seen this many times and enjoy it more as time goes by...if i was on a stranded island and can only have 3 DVD movies with me, this would be one of them.

He's perhaps best known (if at all) for three The Pumpkin Eater, The Innocents and this film, Room at the Top. It's remembered nowadays primarily (and justifiably) due to the extraordinarily rich, earthy performance of Simone Signoret.Room at the Top was a critical and box office success due in part to what was (at the time) some fairly straight forward dialog about sex. Seen from the vantage point of 50 years later, much of that dialog is quaint and square. There are several films of this time period (like Pillow Talk and Jack Clayton's follow-up to Room at the Top, his adaptation of Lawrence's Sons and Lovers) that pushed the boundaries of accepted tastes and reaped box office success from it. One could argue that without it, these films would not have been successful. Room at the Top probably would have ended up in this category were it not for Simone Signoret. Signoret's performance feels full bodied, rich and real. She's the heart and soul of the film and she's years ahead of her time. She acts the way Glenda Jackson, Jane Fonda, Ellen Burstyn and Meryl Streep would act later on in the 70s. (It's astonishing to me that the Academy managed to recognize this and awarded her the Best Actress award in 1959. I suspect it helped that she spoke English as it is easier for a wider audience to easily understand and react to.) When the films pivotal tragedy strikes, it's impact is completely understandable because of her. The rest of the film is extremely well made but no other character in it has the depth and honest charm of Signoret. (SPOILER My sole quibble is not with Signoret's performance but with her characters design. To me, it didn't make complete sense that a woman of such earthy charm and self knowledge would or could fall apart the way she does when Joe Lampton is forced to abandon her. In the scene where she tells Lampton about how she once posed nude for an artist, she comes across as a woman with an independent mind and spirit who (despite the heartbreak) could and would recover from such abandonment. Her end seems more of a contrived plot driver than a realist outcome.)

It is not until the very end, after the marriage gets properly annulled and Paul and Ellie get married, that the movie can make the suggestion that something more than flirting may happen between the two. Although I would never wish for the any type of censorship on Hollywood (or anyone else) to come back into effect today, there was something about the modesty and innocence of the film (a quality that is almost extinct in modern comedies) that I really appreciated.

Romantic couples are constantly finding new ways to fall in love with their loved ones or their ex partners,such as playing tricks on their partner's other romantic lover just to get their original partner to fall in love with them again.Sometimes,the male or the female would have to go out of their way to make sure that their partner don't have any feelings for anybody else so that way, they can keep their romantic life to themselves. Lies and tricks are horrible ways to get people to like or dislike you or put people in slander. Only when the truth comes out does romance and friendship become pure and faithful, and the couple will like each other for who they are.The filming and lighting in this film had gotten more advanced and better in 1940. There were a lot more panning in and out of the main characters with dramatic lighting on their faces that would create suspense and dramatize the scene. There was more cast shadows and reflected lights that almost looked as if they were created by real natural light on the wall, in a few scenes. The movement from scene to scene was more fluid and moved at a fast pace to give the film a more dramatic feel and make it more frantic and conveying the urgency of the character's actions and motives in the film, especially the news that was being shown throughout the movie within the narrative. The comedy was brought to a standstill throughout most of the film, except for a few awkward scenes with Grant, Johnson, and Baldwin.The comedy that was briefly showed flowed well through the film in a dialogue realistic manner. The acting in this movie was excellent.

We don't need much convincing that Navy Seals training is a hardcore testosterone-fueled boys club. And its a scary place to be. I'd liken it to a girl put into an all-boys public high-school. She's eaten alive at every turn. The viewer is put in the position of such vulnerability, because we are aligned with the one woman in a world full of bitter, threatened soldiers, constantly passing sexist comments and threatening to take advantage of the female Seal.There are moments that border on exploitation Demi Moore's implants are put to good use in a sequence doing pushups in a short cut-off shirt, set to Three Dog Night's Mama Told Me (Not to Come). There is a speech intended for dafter viewers by an African-American character sympathising with Moore by likening her to his grandfather who was refused navy service on the grounds that African-Americans can't see at night (A surreal anecdote, but believable.) On the whole, however, the film is well made in Ridley's late style, which is to say, less style than his earlier pictures. It has several glimpses of the striking lighting which characterised his earlier pictures. My recommendations are as follows 1) If you're looking for a silly movie, this is not one. Its dark.2) If you're looking for a dark war training picture, or a good drama, then I recommend it.3) If you're going through all Ridley Scott's movies as I am, this is a good three-star picture, but probably won't be one of your favourites by the end, which for me so far are Alien, Legend and Blade Runner.
