The filmed earned Bette Midler a nomination for Best Actress in what might be her best screen role. At least it's the favorite of mine.Dixie Leonard where Midler gets to show all her talents is a young club singer who gets a break to accompany famous entertainer Eddie Sparks as played by James Caan on a USO tour in World War II. Midler's husband is an army photographer who's killed in action, but she still has his son who is played at various times in his life by Brandon Call and Christopher Rydell, director Mark Rydell's son. George Segal who is Caan's gag writer also is Midler's uncle and he acts as cupid in this show business marriage. All of Midler and Caan's lives are played out against the background of America in World War II, the Korean War, the McCarthy Era and Vietnam.Caan's character of Eddie Sparks is said to be based on Bob Hope and God only knows what Hope must have thought of this film at the time it was out. By that point his stature as an American icon was secure. Hope was known to have liaisons with a few female performers, most discreetly however. The best known that kind of bubbled to the surface was with Marilyn Maxwell who Midler's character might have been based on. The character of Eddie Sparks however had three daughters and America's most well known father of girls was Eddie Cantor in most of this era. And Cantor's most well known extra-marital affair involved Joan Davis.By the way actress Shannon Wilcox has a brief but really telling part as Caan's ice princess of a wife. Her few scenes tell you exactly why Caan's out roaming.Caan got a lot of criticism for his part and I'm mystified as to why. Eddie Sparks is a complex part and Caan mastered all the subtleties even though he's not my idea of a song and dance man. He's the kind of man who will stop at nothing to climb the ladder of success, but he's also not a totally bad man. Knowing full well that George Segal's pungent political comments in front of gossip columnist Rosemary Murphy, another ice princess, will get him in trouble, he tries in one scene to tell him to just cool it. In that other classic, The Way We Were, Caan is adhering to Robert Redford's philosophy where in ten years time right wing producers will be hiring left wing writers and the blacklist will be forgotten, it's just something to be ridden out if one keeps a cool head. I don't think Caan was totally wrong there, he didn't want to lose his friend and a good writer.What finally breaks Midler and Caan apart is the death of her son, like his father in combat in Vietnam. Caan and the boy bonded genuinely and the young man, probably more to honor his father chose a military career, graduating from the Citadel. Caan has a flip attitude towards education which is something the kid picks up on. But people who have a flip attitude towards education, albeit with a military bent, don't last at the Citadel.Midler sees Caan as a warmonger who built his career on the publicity surrounding the entertainment of troops like Bob Hope. Caan argues quite rightly that he doesn't make policy, he doesn't send kids to war, he's a song and dance man. A good mixture of songs from the various eras make up the score for For The Boys. One song, Bill-A-Dick by Hoagy Carmichael and Paul Francis Webster was an unpublished number at the time it was written and makes its debut here. It's sung by Midler along with Melissa Manchester and Pattie Darcy as an Andrews Sisters like trio. Remember Midler did revive the Andrews Sisters's Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.The film is an absolute gem, Midler is divine and don't listen to the criticisms that were given to James Caan.

Usually that prior one is pretty good. In this case, it IS pretty good, and historically important too.It was the first popular talkie, and not all talkie either. It was pretty amazing in depicting New York Jewry in a way gathered from the reality of the era, and on that score alone is fascinating. It was perhaps overly melodramatic, but suitably severe. And its message though simple wasn't quite dumb that jazz music can be sacred work if delivered so. Along the way, we got (still!) entertaining songs. Now this. I do not know what prompted the remake. It seems that they simply had Neil Diamond and saw a fit. He is Jewish. He has a fantastic portfolio of songs, some of which seem written for the project, and he is at least a credible actor. So they tromped through the old script, modernizing as they went. They shifted the focus to the music and the self- discovery of the musician. The rift with the father is recast as upset over sex rather than jazz, something I think is a big mistake.And the script and production values (other than the songs) is horrible, Laurence Olivier embarrasses himself and us all every thing he speaks with some sort of faux stage accent. he is truly dreadful. Everyone is, save one, but he is the worst. The only good actor is on screen only a few times he is the booker, played by Sully Boyar, and every time he shows up to speak, the sun shines.

Firstly, it is a very rough interpretation of real events, and in places extremely so. Certain key characters are portrayed incorrectly - notably Jack Clement and Sam Phillips - but most importantly it is the persona of Jerry Lee himself that is of concern. I certainly don't blame Dennis Quaid for this; his performance is suitably crazed and his on-stage antics are at times reminiscent of The Killer in his prime. But Quaid was clearly instructed to play the role more as a comic turn than as the troubled and conflicted man that Lewis was at the time. In fact, the whole film is positioned as some sort of over-the-top comedy, and some of the lowest points of Lewis's life are treated with, at best, a kind of dark slapstick.There are also some more minor details which I personally disagreed with. In some ways, getting Lewis himself to re-record many of his classic hits was a good idea and added more immediacy to the 'live' performances than the old and familiar recordings would have done. However, in parts of the film where actual records of his songs were playing, I believe the originals should have been used to add authenticity. This raises the wider point of the fact that Dennis Quaid lip-syncs at all. Ever since Gary Busey, Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith performed every song completely live in The Buddy Holly Story, anything less has been (rightly or wrongly) seen as some sort of cop-out in rock biopics. Lip-syncing has been used with minor success in films such as Ray, but there is an argument that says you should allow whichever actor you have entrusted to play a rock legend the opportunity to undertake the most important aspect of the character - the musical performance.Another issue with the film is one of its main themes - the relationship between Jerry Lee and Myra, which is handled rather clunkily. The resolution between Lewis and Myra's father is sudden and unexplained, and the relationship somehow goes from being completely taboo to accepted and even normal in a very short time.I'm not surprised that this film was disliked by the Killer himself. It makes light of extremely serious chapters in his life and misrepresents certain people who were dear to him. In my view, it is never a good idea to take a real story and tailor it for your own preference in the hope of entertaining people. Usually, the real story - and in this case, the real man - is much more interesting.

Let's just say, a bunch. I never saw it in the theater, which I suppose is my one big regret in life. The first time I watched it was from a bootleg video print someone loaned me not long after the film came out. I remember standing in one spot in front of the TV, not moving for two hours until it was over. I didn't even realize I was standing the whole time.

This is Ridley Scott's masterwork and try as they might, none of the film's imitators have managed to duplicate its aura of silent menace and genuinely disturbing creepiness. While 'Alien' draws its inspiration from several earlier films and books, the way it merges them all together seems completely original. H.R.

The alien itself is wet, slimy, feral; it's as though the crew is trapped with an insane, rabid, murderous animal that they never get a good look at (and neither do we, until the very end.)

At first one may say that the entire film is one long road towards destruction- the destruction of a man's family, then of his morality. Or maybe it implies destruction of a hit-man's ex- employers by the ex-employee. Or it could be the destruction of all the hopes and dreams of a man, followed by the destruction of those who destroyed the hopes and dreams. The point is, these forms of perdition are not what the film is meant to be about.

After his wife and one of two sons is killed by his brother, also intending to murder Sullivan and his second son, Michael and Peter (Liam Aiken) go on the run to primarily escape danger, then go on a mission of revenge- both corporal and pecuniary.Throughout the film, Michael kills men practically in front of Peter, robs banks with the help of Peter, and, alongside Peter, is shot at by a sociopathic hit-man (who happens to have an interest in the art of photography and played by Jude Law). The thing about these horrendous acts by Michael in front of his young son, who is merely a child, is that the audience supports each one after the other, smiling at the bank robberies and satiated by the coldblooded murders of his enemies.

I think the original film was meant to be a single movie that stood on its own, but a sequel was squeezed out when it turned out to be a Best Picture winner, and since this first sequel was so good, it seems only natural that it should be followed by four more, right?The movie starts off exactly where the original film left off. It even shows the last few minutes of the last film before continuing on to the hospital, where Creed's attitude has changed drastically. He is no longer telling Rocky that there will be no rematch, now he's so angry that he's demanding, from his wheelchair, that Rocky get up out of his own wheelchair right then and there and they'll finish the fight. Rocky, in his unique way, politely wonders what Apollo's so mad about, but ultimately they both go their separate ways in the hospital because, of course, neither can really stand up under their own power too well by this point. Rocky and Adrian are now married and shopping for a new house and a new life together using Rocky's winnings from his first fight with Apollo. But the money goes quickly, even though it was such a huge and commercially successful spectacle. You remember in the original film, for his amateur fights, his total prize money was something like $40. Rocky brought home tens of thousands from the fight with Apollo, but he and Adrian bought a house and a car and various other essentials and soon found themselves again with little to no money and a whole list of new expenses.Rocky promised Adrian that he wouldn't fight anymore because she just can't handle the stress and the emotional trauma of watching her love getting battered all over the ring, so when Apollo begins publicly chastising Rocky for winning by freak chance and demanding that he face him again in the ring, Rocky has to grin and bear it even though he is forced to earn money doing janitorial work at the local boxing gym. The movie works because it plays on all the things about Rocky's personality that made us love him in the first place. A lesser film would have had the hero angrily fling his mop and bucket against the wall and get right up in Apollo's face, but Rocky is more devoted to his wife than to his public image, so he literally does grin and ignore the taunts and demands coming from Rocky, even though his life has become something so timid and moneyless.Adrian hears the demands and watches Rocky worriedly, afraid that he is going to give in to the pressure and endanger his safety again, but even though Rocky is tentatively interested in defending his reputation in the ring, it is more important to him to make his wife happy. But both are driven to the ring because Apollo has lost the respect of his fans, who think that he was paid to take a fall, and Rocky and Adrian are on their way to the poor house. It is one of the film's few week moments when she changes her mind and urges him to fight again, but the formula that we saw and loved from the first film comes back and it still works here. The only major drawback of the first Rocky sequel is that it is much, much too sappy. There are genuine emotional moments when Adrian falls into a coma after giving birth to their son, but mostly it is things like the army of thousands of children following Rocky completely parent-less as he goes on one of his famous training runs. I realize he's famous in Philadelphia now, but an endless crowd of children? Come on&#133;The fight at the end of the movie fulfills a dream that was unfulfilled in the first movie, and some people will argue that it is unnecessary since, in some ways, it sort of negates the whole purpose of the first movie ending the way it did, but Rocky II is such a good movie that this doesn't seem to matter. The fight's not as well done as in the original film, for most of the time you may find yourself wondering why Rocky, from start to finish, doesn't block Apollo's punches at ALL, but it is no less exciting. In the world of sequels, this is definitely among the best ones.Oh and by the way, Rocky II was released the day after I was born!

","genre":"Drama, Sport"},{"date":"11 November 2008","score":"","review":" So when Apollo says at the end of the first film that there isn't going to be any rematch (sorry, ain't gonna be no rematch), I'm thinking that it was probably because no one really knew how big the movie was going to be. I think the original film was meant to be a single movie that stood on its own, but a sequel was squeezed out when it turned out to be a Best Picture winner, and since this first sequel was so good, it seems only natural that it should be followed by four more, right?The movie starts off exactly where the original film left off. It even shows the last few minutes of the last film before continuing on to the hospital, where Creed's attitude has changed drastically. He is no longer telling Rocky that there will be no rematch, now he's so angry that he's demanding, from his wheelchair, that Rocky get up out of his own wheelchair right then and there and they'll finish the fight. Rocky, in his unique way, politely wonders what Apollo's so mad about, but ultimately they both go their separate ways in the hospital because, of course, neither can really stand up under their own power too well by this point. Rocky and Adrian are now married and shopping for a new house and a new life together using Rocky's winnings from his first fight with Apollo. But the money goes quickly, even though it was such a huge and commercially successful spectacle. You remember in the original film, for his amateur fights, his total prize money was something like $40. Rocky brought home tens of thousands from the fight with Apollo, but he and Adrian bought a house and a car and various other essentials and soon found themselves again with little to no money and a whole list of new expenses.Rocky promised Adrian that he wouldn't fight anymore because she just can't handle the stress and the emotional trauma of watching her love getting battered all over the ring, so when Apollo begins publicly chastising Rocky for winning by freak chance and demanding that he face him again in the ring, Rocky has to grin and bear it even though he is forced to earn money doing janitorial work at the local boxing gym. The movie works because it plays on all the things about Rocky's personality that made us love him in the first place. A lesser film would have had the hero angrily fling his mop and bucket against the wall and get right up in Apollo's face, but Rocky is more devoted to his wife than to his public image, so he literally does grin and ignore the taunts and demands coming from Rocky, even though his life has become something so timid and moneyless.Adrian hears the demands and watches Rocky worriedly, afraid that he is going to give in to the pressure and endanger his safety again, but even though Rocky is tentatively interested in defending his reputation in the ring, it is more important to him to make his wife happy. But both are driven to the ring because Apollo has lost the respect of his fans, who think that he was paid to take a fall, and Rocky and Adrian are on their way to the poor house. It is one of the film's few week moments when she changes her mind and urges him to fight again, but the formula that we saw and loved from the first film comes back and it still works here. The only major drawback of the first Rocky sequel is that it is much, much too sappy. There are genuine emotional moments when Adrian falls into a coma after giving birth to their son, but mostly it is things like the army of thousands of children following Rocky completely parent-less as he goes on one of his famous training runs. I realize he's famous in Philadelphia now, but an endless crowd of children? Come on&#133;The fight at the end of the movie fulfills a dream that was unfulfilled in the first movie, and some people will argue that it is unnecessary since, in some ways, it sort of negates the whole purpose of the first movie ending the way it did, but Rocky II is such a good movie that this doesn't seem to matter.

One of the greatest things about this movie is that the father, who is constantly busy throughout this film whether it's battling the furnace or trying to get his car to start or any other number of task that he becomes occupied with, has very little dialog with Ralphie. Yet it is the father who in the end gets him his BB gun, he knew all along what Ralphie wanted although he never was told directly what it was he wanted. When reading reviews for this movie I am surprised that this has been overlooked. The final scene with the Father and Mother just sitting down watching it snow was the only time in the movie they showed affection for each other, not because they didn't care for one another but because like in real life they were just too busy. Finally when the children go to sleep they have their quite sentimental moment together and it was more believable than any scene in any romantic movie that has ever been made. A Christmas Story's final line sums up how truly happy Ralphie is now he has his Christmas wish. Next to me in the blackness lay my oiled blue steel beauty.

Other times I am pleasantly surprised at how good a movie is, or irritated at how bad, or just amazed that someone would think to make something so bizarre or cheesy. But with Rocky, everything is exactly what it should be, the movie knows exactly where it belongs and exactly what it wants to say, and so it comes across as a perfectly natural piece of storytelling. The way that Rocky was directed not only indicates skillful direction but also very skillful acting. The film is composed of unusually long takes. There is very little cutting during scenes, which is difficult to do because the actors have to act for such a long time without stopping. This type of cinematography requires much more planning and meticulous rehearsal to get right, and there is much more dialogue for the actors to know all at once. There is something to be said about the actors because they were able to do this and still avoid making the dialogue sound even a little bit rehearsed.There have been thousands of movies made about an underdog getting the chance of a lifetime and rising to the challenge, but not only is Rocky barely about that fight, it also goes deeper and gives a reason for it. The world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, is planning a fight on the 4th of July that is to be a major, major event. All other professional fighters are booked on other events or, if he says so himself, afraid to fight him. This necessity inspires Creed to come up with a marketing ploy where he will broadcast an opportunity for an amateur fighter to fight the greatest fighter in the world on America's 200th birthday. But not just any fighter, it has to be someone significant, someone that will give meaning to the date that the event is to take place, and of course someone who will make Creed look symbolic and meaningful as he's knocking him out. And what better way to celebrate America's birthday and how far we've come than for a black man to beat an Italian in a major fighting event! (you see, Creed mistakenly believed that Christopher Columbus, an Italian, had discovered America, unaware that Columbus never set foot in North America and thought he was in India anyway, and regardless, the Chinese had landed on American's east coast more than 70 years before Columbus ever set sail!).But what really wins Rocky's way into our hearts is how regular he is. Like it or not, he's a big, dumb oaf, but he's honest, he's hard-working (his job as a collector for a bookie is not exactly high-brow professionalism, but he knows it's a bum job but he also knows that it's really the only thing he's any good at), he has a genuine love for someone who clearly needs it, and he cares for small animals and there's nothing quite as charming as a huge man who loves his turtles. Besides that, he believes in himself, even when it seems ludicrous to even consider that he might have a chance against the greatest fighter in the world. What gives the movie real drama is that to Apollo, the entire fight is just for show, but Rocky doesn't know that. He thinks it's meant to be a real chance for an unknown fighter to challenge the heavyweight champion. Apollo plans to knock him out whenever he's ready, but still that he's doing some kind of humanitarian thing by putting an unknown fighter's name and face up there on that poster next to his own. The fight between Rocky and Apollo at the end of the film is one of the true classic moments in the history of film-making. It proves that it's not about winning or losing, and it's not even about how you play the game, it's about giving it everything you've got when you have an opportunity. Rocky had a chance to do something that seemed impossible, and he did everything he possibly could do to make it happen. Bravo!

The dinosaurs, while obviously models moving in stop motion, are not cartoons but realistic models. If a giant Allosaurus is about to attack, he whips his lizard-like tail around, just as the Ymir did in 20,000 Miles to Earth. They copied a lot of this stuff for the 1950s monster movies.And the plot! I don't know how closely in adheres to Conan-Doyle's novel, but in The Lost World we see laid bare the structure -- the armature, as it were -- of a dozen later movies, beginning with King Kong. How's this for a plot structure? A hardy handful of explorers and adventurers travel to an exotic land, dragging a beautiful young woman along. There, they discover dangerous creatures of monstrous size, prehistoric and alien. They manage to capture one of the beasts and take it back alive to the Big City, but it escapes and runs wild through the streets, smashing buildings, knocking over landmarks, eating people, and parking illegally in handicapped zones.That's what happens here, only instead of a giant ape or some ill-formed and befanged organism from outer space, it's a brontosaurus.The effects are really sophisticated for their time, 1925. And though the science may be pure hokum, still the adventure is an exciting one. What's missing here is the death of the monster, and the pathos of King Kong's death, who, after all, died for love, just like the rest of us. This dinosaur simple rumbles onto Tower Bridge. The bridge collapses under its weight and the creature swims to the sea and presumably freedom. Just as well. There is no record of a brontosaurus ever having harmed a human being before. This one was simply taken from its natural environment and presented with the overwhelming temptation to do so. Live and let live, I say. If you don't bother THEM, they don't bother YOU. Unlike, may I say, certain forms of spyware and the purveyors of male enhancement products.The acting is of the period and not worth much attention.This version of The Lost World is shorter than the 1960 Irwin Allen version and I enjoyed it more. In the latter, real lizards and crocodilians, dressed in fake horns and blown up to giant size, actually fought and tore pieces of flesh from each other. These models fight too but nothing is being wounded or killed for our pleasure. There's always the knowledge that what we're watching is what was known at the time as fake photography. Not bad. And not just not bad per se, but not bad because in watching it we seem to be witnessing the birth of an entire genre of films. Willis O'Brien was to pass the baton to Ray Harryhausen, who would carry on with the stop-motion work until obliterated by time and the advent of computer-generated images of the kind we see in Jurassic Park.

The catalyst may well have been a propaganda publication referring to Chaplin as a Jewish sympathizer. In The Great Dictator, Chaplin created a dead-on parody of Hitler that is as funny as it is frightening at times. The film traces Hitler's experiences in the German army from World War I up to the present day. Simultaneously, Chaplin plays a Jewish barber who dresses like the tramp who comes out of a hospital after a long long time, only to discover how different the world is under Nazi rule.Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at the time, plays a young Jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a Jewish ghetto. Jack Oakie has a great, Oscar-nominated supporting role as a Mussolini look-alike (Benzini Napaloni) who gives Chaplin's Hitler character, Adenoid Hynkel, a lot of fits. Henry Daniell is his usual staid self as Garbitsch, chief adviser to Adenoid Hynkel. Chaplin wrote and directed the film and received Oscar nominations for his screenplay and his acting. The film was also nominated for best picture.Chaplin made the film under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known. He financed the entire film himself at great risk because of the subject matter, and there were no other major films made regarding Nazi Germany up to that time. The film spent about twenty-one months in production with Chaplin even rebuilding a set and re-shooting a scene to get things right. By the time of the film's release in October of 1940, the war in Europe was well under way with Hitler conquering one country after another, so the film became much more topical at its release than when production first began.There isn't much plot in looking at the film in retrospect; the film seems more like a series of comedy sketches and\/or mishaps strung together to get to a purpose independent of the film itself. Several examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the meeting between Hynkel and Napaloni. The scene is very very funny, but it leads no where in terms of the plot. Likewise, the escape of both the barber and Schultz simply leads to the mistaken identity of the barber for Hynkel in order to give Chaplin (through the barber character) an opportunity to pontificate to the audience at the end of the film. On the other hand, what better way to make a point about the misplaced narcissism of Aryan superiority than to have a Jewish Barber mistaken for Hynkel? Still, the film contains many high comic moments, such as the rally speech, the new war developments (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), the dancing globe scene, the coin in the pudding scene, and the entire scenario between Hynkel and Napaloni (including the barber chair scene) to highly recommend the film.

Despite the young age of the actress, she seems older and you can read from her face that something unpleasant is going on. An alcoholic (and maybe prostitute) mother to take care of, a life in a campground, no friends, nobody that seems to be vaguely sympathetic with her, the need to work in order to survive and (probably) a poor schooling education. Brothers Dardenne do not give anything from granted the unease of Rosetta's life is given by the continuous repetition of daily acts that in a normal life nobody has to do. Rosetta does not have access to hot water, she does not have a tap water in the van, she dresses with only few pieces of clothing, she always change her shoes with rubber boots before passing through the bush that leads to the campground ,etc. The movie is filled with normal acts that are not skipped or just summarized by the directors. When shutting down the hut where she sells muffins (job stolen to her friend), the directors let you see the entire procedure. The same when Rosetta drags her mother (completely drunk) in the van, or when she goes to get a new gas tank. The strength of the movie is represented by all of these scenes that make a life hard to live.This movie, if it can be defined neorealistic, differs a great deal, for example, from the Italian neorealism of the late '50. Despite all the difficulties of the Italian society after WW2, it appears that at least the family or the solidarity among desperate people is there. Rosetta seems to be an alien, one of the few people remained at the outskirts of a wealthy society. She cannot rely on other people like her, all the environment around her is not in tune, she is alone, she has not a chance to change her life.NOTE FOR SOME US AUDIENCE despite Europe is quite far away and therefore it can be difficult to appreciate difference between countries, I would like to remember that Belgium is not France.

An alcoholic (and maybe prostitute) mother to take care of, a life in a campground, no friends, nobody that seems to be vaguely sympathetic with her, the need to work in order to survive and (probably) a poor schooling education. Brothers Dardenne do not give anything from granted the unease of Rosetta's life is given by the continuous repetition of daily acts that in a normal life nobody has to do. Rosetta does not have access to hot water, she does not have a tap water in the van, she dresses with only few pieces of clothing, she always change her shoes with rubber boots before passing through the bush that leads to the campground ,etc. The movie is filled with normal acts that are not skipped or just summarized by the directors. When shutting down the hut where she sells muffins (job stolen to her friend), the directors let you see the entire procedure.

It's also difficult for me to think of anyone more overrated than Comden and Green, who are right up there with Hitchcock as far as misplaced plaudits are concerned. Their schtick was New York and the bulk of the Books and lyrics they wrote seldom ventured West of Central Park, this Hollywood-spoof being one exception. Producer Arthur Freed clearly wanted to kill two birds with one stone by raiding his own back catalogue of mediocre lyrics (you don't believe me? try listening to Cole Porter, Frank Loesser, Larry Hart, Johnny Mercer, etc) written largely with Nacio Herb Brown and then blatantly 'stealing' Porter's Be A Clown melody and cobbling on new lyrics. The satire is okay but even in 1952 was hardly new, Debbie Reynolds is competent at best, Jean Hagen and Donald O'Connor excellent which leaves Gene Kelly showing yet again how many light years behind Fred Astaire we was lagging. Pleasant rather than memorable.
