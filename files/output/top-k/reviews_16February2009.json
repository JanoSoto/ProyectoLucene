The second entry to Raimi's wonderful Evil Dead franchise, Evil Dead II of 1987 is not so much a sequel, but rather a remake of the first film, this time with a higher budget, more complex special effects, and a strong focus on Comedy elements. Many people actually seem to prefer the sequel over the original, as it got a higher rating here on IMDb. While this sequel is doubtlessly a great film of its own right, I will personally always prefer the 1981 original, a personal all-time favorite of mine which is simply unrivaled in its creepiness and its status as an absolute Horror\/Gore milestone. The sequel once again takes Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend on a trip deep into the woods, where the residents of a small cabin are one by one possessed by evil forces after playing a mysterious tape... The plot is basically the same as that of the original, only that, this time, the film is a very morbid black Horror Comedy rather than a terrifying Horror film like the first one. The original Evil Dead was basically the epitome of Horror, and while it also had some humorous moments, the humor was only present in small doses, and it never lessened the film's constant terrifying suspense. The sequel still has its creepy moments, of course, but in this film, the Comedy elements are predominant. The film is, once again, extremely gory, but even the gore is funny and goes more into the direction of Gore-comedies than of the terrifying original. While Evil Dead II may not be quite as scary as its predecessor (it's still suspenseful though), its humor should appeal to the tastes of the fans of the original - in short it's the most morbid kind of black humor imaginable, just delightfully demented from the beginning. The film also introduces a bunch of new characters, including a stupid redneck named Jake. The original had turned Bruce Campbell into one of the most popular Horror\/B-Movie stars ever, and he is once again great when he reprises the role of his life, Ash, in this sequel. The film's higher budget allows more complex special effects, great makeup and a spectacular cinematography. Yet, as said above, I will always prefer the original, which stands out as of the greatest Horror films ever and the ideal proof that a relatively low budget can result in an absolutely amazing film. Even so, Evil Dead II is a great film, and an absolute must-see for all Horror fans and lovers of morbid humor. Enjoy!

The movie is scary and Vaughn does a good job with his character, making him a little more sinister than the original. The movie, though, really doesn't stand on it's own because it's really not it's own, if you know what I mean.

The Empire Strikes Back brings back the incredible original heroes, gives them even more depth and story and still finds time to bring in new timeless characters that become legends in their own right. Even with a new director at the helm, Irvin Kershner, the story and the world that made the first Star Wars so incredible is in tact and even better. The only problem really with the first Star Wars is it felt like only the beginning. Like there were layers of detail that we didn't get and The Empire Strikes Back burst into those layers and put us deep into the world and the story never to turn back. On top of that the film delivers the first and most infamous twist in film history...family connections so to speak. I won't give it away if you have existed under a rock for the last three decades. The fights are epic, the new characters are amazing, and even Hamill as Skywalker starts to really shine and get some real depth to his character.I already reviewed the cast of the original film but their characters really do change a lot for the better in the sequel. Mark Hamill's performance matures and really comes full circle just like his character in the film. His naivety and boyish charm changes for the better as he trains to become a Jedi and an adult. Harrison Ford's Han Solo is probably the character that changes the least and probably just a case of don't mess with a good thing. Solo is still a kick butt hero and his story is a focal point of the sequel. Carrie Fisher slips back into her role as the feisty Princess flawlessly. This time the banter and romantic tension between Fisher and Ford heats up and really gives the story a timeless romance. Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Peter Mayhew return in full form as C3P0, R2D2 and Chewbacca and they are better than ever. David Prowse with James Earl Jones providing the voice continues to make Darth Vader the most evil, intensely bad villain in the history of films. Vader's character really turns up the heat and gives a terrifying turn as the leader of the Empire. Billy Dee Williams is a newcomer to the cast and a welcome addition. He plays gambler, scoundrel Lando Calrissian. He doesn't get a lot of background or depth to his character and yet he is a great addition to the cast. And saving the best for last...the master of the Star Wars Universe. Frank Oz brings Master Yoda to life. The entire sequence with Luke and Yoda meeting for the first time and training is brilliant. Yoda is a timeless character, a pop culture phenomenon and yet his part in this is touching, funny, and brilliant. Pretty good for a puppet.The Empire Strikes Back is just simply non stop. The film picks up where the first left off and takes the viewer on a thrill ride that just never stops. This is ultimately all about the evil Empire and Vader getting his revenge and essentially succeeding. Starting from the opening moment of the film on the brilliantly crafted ice world of Hoth, and continuing on to a show down between Skywalker and Vader himself and the revealing of the infamous secret this film is just brilliant. The direction, the creation, the writing, the characters and the special effects are jaw droppingly amazing. There is simply no way you can watch just one Star Wars movie because the story is so important but after watching the first one and thinking...wow this is pretty incredible, The Empire Strikes Back will floor you!!

We get the classic minkey sequence and meet Cato, for the first time, in one of the series' great slapstick routines. However the film has a sort of split personality and the current DVD transfer is too grainy for a large-screen TV IMHO. So, rent it, but I'd wait for something better if you're looking to collect.I wouldn't exactly say this movie sets the tone for the rest of the series. The original starred David Niven, with an all-star supporting cast including Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau. Then Clouseau became the star of A Shot in the Dark, which didn't involve either the Pink Panther gem nor jewel thief Sir Charles Lytton. This film has them all, so tries to 'balance' the action between Clouseau and Sir Charles.

It looks like one of those real hardcore chick-flick romances, where a bunch of middle-aged-to-elderly housewives and lonely women go in and imagine themselves in the part of Francesca being possibly taken away by Robert Kincaid to far away places. And no wonder since it was first a book that was a major hit - and also, from all accounts I've heard, a trashy piece of mainstream for-women work. But the factor of Clint Eastwood is a curious one, especially since he's rarely had movies that were about just two people in love (the closest one can find are in the 70s with Play Misty for Me, which is more of a thriller, and the obscure Breezy). It turns out he was an excellent choice to direct the picture, as well as appear as co-lead, because he never second-guesses or pushes the material where it would feel false.In fact, this is one of the more realistic weepie love story films I have come across, at least from recent memory. It starts with the dialog and the characters, and whatever writer Richard LaGravanese was able to take away from the book he made it work for Eastwood's aesthetic, which is that of two people who meet, have actual conversations without pablum or hokey bits, and even when the occasional self-indulgent narration bits from Francesca come up they're not un-welcome. When we see this man Robert come into Francesca's life it's very natural, or appears to be as much as it could be for these two people. Then as things deepen, albeit quickly, this becomes part of the romantic feel that is captured with subtlety and delicacy. So, when the real dramatic quandaries come around- of whether or not this woman will leave her husband, who is a good man without anything on him to make him villainous, and her kids- it too is dealt with rationally, with a sense of tragedy but humanity.Bridges of Madison County is nothing if not a very human tale of love and loss. It's a chick-flick with all of its clichés pared down, stripped away of all their chicken fat and shown with the bones that make them work for just any viewer looking for a good story, love or otherwise. And Eastwood is also very good at including the plot device of the two 40-something kids reading through the late Francesca's journals- their own experiences as people are brought in to the narrative wonderfully. All in all, the story reveals the filmmaker to have such a great sense of what makes a good romance film- a hopeless romance, perhaps, in a similar mold of the films of Wong Kar Wai- while also being able to have us connect with these people. The wife commits infidelity, but it's hard to really side either way. They're too real and too conflicted to stick on any one side (some may disagree, which maybe will reveal more about themselves than the actual film, which is interesting), which is rare.And what about the stars? This and Heat are, clearly, the films that in 1995 had iconic stars of their generation on screen facing off. Whereas Pacino and DeNiro had one scene, Clint and Streep have the bulk of the picture to hang on to. It goes without saying Streep lays bare her characters flaws and conflicts and joy so well, a given perhaps, but the real revelation is Eastwood. Who knew such a man who usually eats grit for breakfast and in later years has a gravel-chiseled profile has such a tender soul to lay bare? There are some who will avoid the picture just for this reason, which perhaps is fair; no one wants to see their tough-guy icon showing how soft and vulnerable they can be on camera.

This version of Bangkok Dangerous was filmed in Thailand, not their homeland of China. It must have been challenging to secure funding and other rudimentary objectives before filming began. Their deaf-mute hit-man concept is unique (at least from my own limited film viewing experience). Bangkok Dangerous reflects the precision and enthusiasm of their direction. I can see how many people enjoy it. I can't say that I'm one of them. I found the movie severely lacking a plot until halfway through, and I didn't like how many action sequences were framed. It's so distracting to watch this subtitled movie while various faces appear. Your eyes are drawn to someone's face in anticipation of, well anything, and you miss dialog. Close up shots are to provide introspection within character or audience or heighten the experience of an action segment. If overused, like they are here, they become a murky amalgamation of meaninglessness. However, I must confess that if you know Thai, you won't experience the framing problem to the degree I did.Kong is a warm blooded killer from the mean streets of downtown Bangkok. We see him shooting people throughout the opening segments and cannot detect if he has any remorse for his occupation. He looks passé in comparison to the modern hit men of Western cinema. He goes home after a hard day of work to his shared apartment that is inhabited by his employer Jo. Jo may not really be his employer. I couldn't tell what his job is. He seems to exist to provide Kong companionship. Oh, and he also brings in business by asking his girlfriend, Aom, to deliver requests to Kong.

I usually hate reviewing films that have this aura of absolute majesty around them with a fan base that is insane!! But I have no worries reviewing this and the subsequent sequels because this is one of my favorite movie series of all times. I am not a HUGE sci-fi fan but this film can appeal to every genre watcher in the world. Star Wars was so simply made, and carefully crafted, and gingerly put together by a man who had such deep passion for the story and everything he built from the ground up. The special effects they used, the story, the characters, everything about it is the definition of timeless because it is as good now as it was more than three decades ago. The characters come to life, each and every one of them and the story leaves you riveted to every moment and throws this mysterious force of good against one of, if not thee, greatest villain in movie history. The film, I believe, has this deeper meaning, something that could actually be translated into modern day religion of belief systems and created one of the greatest pop culture references in the world.Who to start with in this cast...Mark Hamill IS Luke Skywalker. Now I will say openly Hamill is not a great actor. In fact his performance as Skywalker in the first film is a little cheesy and weak and even amateur. And yet still you become enamored with the young, naive Skywalker. Harrison Ford became a star and for good reason playing Space adventurer Han Solo. Ford exudes confidence and snide sarcasm and is the perfect hero. He has always been one of my favorite characters and subsequently one of my favorite actors. Carrie Fisher creates one of the greatest female heroines in film history. Her portrayal of sexy feisty Princess Leia is timeless. She is strong willed, and just as tough as the other male heroes but still exudes this terrific feminine sexy character. Her and Solo and their banter are fantastic. Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew are just brilliant as their respective sidekick roles as C-3P0, R2D2, and Chewbacca. Baker and Mayhew do have a single English line in the film and create these lovable fantastic character and Daniels is a master at the comedy, sarcasm, and scared C3P0. The three of them become like a fantastic trio that is a must have in the film. David Prowse and James Earl Jones (as the infamous voice) play the evil Darth Vader. Vader doesn't really come full circle evil in this film but he is still one of the best villains in film history. This is only a small dip into Vader's character.George Lucas, the master and leader of all modern day nerds geeks and sci-fi lovers created this film with every ounce of his being. His labor of love shows through because the film is so delicately constructed. Even though the first film is not even the most epic, it has this feel of being so much bigger than what anyone could have dreamed. We know now what Star Wars and the world around it is all about but in 1977 this was all new and just the timeless, magic, immense feeling makes it all worth while. If there is any living person left who hasn't experienced Star Wars then you are missing out. It doesn't matter what your film likes or dislikes are...there is something for everyone in this film and there will inevitably be a character you fall in love with!! If only I could experience the film again in a theater. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 February 2009","score":"","review":" I don't know when I first saw Star Wars but I know I never tire of seeing it again and again.

I was eleven years old while the film was enjoying its box office success, and yes, I did hear a lot about the movie and how massive it was. I was also soon familiar with the famous song, My Heart Will Go On, performed by the greatly despised Celine Dion. Still, I never actually saw the movie for over a decade. Shortly before finally watching it, I knew that despite its popularity, it has also been widely ridiculed. So, it wouldn't have surprised me if I wasn't very impressed at all, but that didn't exactly turn out to be the case.84 years after the sinking of the Titanic, a group of treasure hunters discover a drawing of a naked woman from the ship's wreckage. A TV report catches the attention of a woman around 101 years old named Rose Calvert, who contacts the treasure hunters to tell them that she is the one in that picture! She then goes with her granddaughter, Elizabeth, to visit the team. Although they are skeptical, the very elderly woman begins to tell them about her experience back in 1912, when she was Rose DeWitt Bukater, a rich teenager aboard the Titanic, believed to have gone down with the ship! She tells them how she began an unlikely romantic relationship with a poor young man on board named Jack Dawson after he saved her from a suicide attempt, and how this led to conflict between Rose and her family and oafish fiancée Caledon Hockley.Several months ago, I watched Pearl Harbour, and it seemed that some people compared that film to Titanic, which I thought was not good. As a result, I was expecting the same kind of poor dialogue and romance in this movie, the first of the two. Well, I definitely did find some fairly weak dialogue, and there definitely are flaws in the romance, so the film does have those things in common with its successor, but fortunately to a lesser degree. At least none of it made me laugh here, though it certainly does take some points off. Some of the performances here are also weak, including some of the actors who played the treasure hunters in the 90's parts of the film. When the acting isn't poor, it's basically average, for the most part at least. Oh well, at least I actually cared about what happened to the two main characters, even if they weren't portrayed as well as they could have been. I watched this movie on VHS, and due to its length, it was split onto two tapes. To tell you the truth, I was definitely more impressed with the content on the second tape than the content on the first. Without the climax (which I saw on the second video tape), I would be giving this movie a rating no higher than 6\/10, but even that part isn't perfect.I know this is a widely loathed movie. I'm also no fan of the widely loathed Celine Dion, who performed the hit song for the film, and am not proud of the fact that she's from my country. (Mind you, I think My Heart Will Go On is the only song in her catalogue I've ever heard more than once, and I couldn't even name any of the others.) However, while it is severely flawed, and I wouldn't want to watch it multiple times, I think it could have been much worse. The climax is suspenseful, and before that, the film basically has some good and not so good moments. There may be some FAIRLY moving moments in this 1997 blockbuster, though nothing that even came close to having me in tears, unlike apparently many other viewers. It was also interesting for me seeing Gloria Stuart as 101-year-old Rose, since I had previously seen her in The Invisible Man, which was made over sixty years before this film! Is this version of Titanic thoroughly inaccurate? I'm sure it is, so don't watch it if you want a realistic film based on historical fact. It's a fictional story about a romantic relationship between two fictional people. While it isn't worthy of its position as the highest grossing movie of all time, nor was it worthy of eleven Oscars, at least I think I can call it half-decent.

Well, I definitely did find some fairly weak dialogue, and there definitely are flaws in the romance, so the film does have those things in common with its successor, but fortunately to a lesser degree. At least none of it made me laugh here, though it certainly does take some points off. Some of the performances here are also weak, including some of the actors who played the treasure hunters in the 90's parts of the film. When the acting isn't poor, it's basically average, for the most part at least. Oh well, at least I actually cared about what happened to the two main characters, even if they weren't portrayed as well as they could have been. I watched this movie on VHS, and due to its length, it was split onto two tapes. To tell you the truth, I was definitely more impressed with the content on the second tape than the content on the first. Without the climax (which I saw on the second video tape), I would be giving this movie a rating no higher than 6\/10, but even that part isn't perfect.I know this is a widely loathed movie. I'm also no fan of the widely loathed Celine Dion, who performed the hit song for the film, and am not proud of the fact that she's from my country. (Mind you, I think My Heart Will Go On is the only song in her catalogue I've ever heard more than once, and I couldn't even name any of the others.) However, while it is severely flawed, and I wouldn't want to watch it multiple times, I think it could have been much worse. The climax is suspenseful, and before that, the film basically has some good and not so good moments. There may be some FAIRLY moving moments in this 1997 blockbuster, though nothing that even came close to having me in tears, unlike apparently many other viewers. It was also interesting for me seeing Gloria Stuart as 101-year-old Rose, since I had previously seen her in The Invisible Man, which was made over sixty years before this film! Is this version of Titanic thoroughly inaccurate? I'm sure it is, so don't watch it if you want a realistic film based on historical fact. It's a fictional story about a romantic relationship between two fictional people. While it isn't worthy of its position as the highest grossing movie of all time, nor was it worthy of eleven Oscars, at least I think I can call it half-decent. I'm not sure what it would have been like watching this film without having seen Pearl Harbour first, but now that I've seen them both, I do think Titanic is pretty good in comparison.

It is in the middle between Aunty Entity (Tina Turner), the leader of the town and the Master Blaster (Angelo Rossitto and Paul Larsson) who runs the power supply. Max agrees to help Aunty Entity in exchange for the return of his belongings and ends up challenging the Blaster in the Thunderdome (a gladiatorial style battle).

For good reasons, as this is one of the most unique and original cinematic masterpieces ever brought to screen and an absolute must-see for everybody interested in film. I will not try to discuss whether this is a Horror film or not. The unique greatness of The Wicker Man combines elements from a variety of genres, Horror, Thriller, Mystery, Fantasy, Drama, and even Musical, but it can not really be limited to one particular genre. The Wicker Man is one of the most essential films for any lover of Horror and Cult-Cinema to see for a variety of reasons. Firstly, this film profits from one of the greatest scripts ever written. The convoluted and fascinating story of The Wicker Man from the pen of Anthony Shaffner, who had previously written the screenplays to Sleuth (1972) and Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy (also 1972) is based on David Pinner's novel Ritual. Though I have never read the novel, I must say that Shaffner more than deserves to be called a genius for how he transferred it into one of the most intriguing scripts in film history.Scottish police sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is called by an anonymous letter to investigate the disappearance of a young girl on the remote Scottish island Summerisle. Upon his arrival, nobody seems to have ever heard of the girl. The deeply religious Sergeant Howie, however, is shocked to find out that the residents of the island, above all the sophisticated but mysterious Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), are practicing a pagan customs and free sexuality...As said above, the ingenious script by Anthony Shaffner must be one of the most brilliant that was ever written. Robin Hardy's direction also deserves utmost praise, however. The beautiful Scottish landscapes are a wonderful setting for this fascinating film, the cinematography is brilliant, and, above all, the film provides one of the most unique scores. Beautiful Scottish folk songs go in hand with gripping suspense, surrealism and convoluted mystery. Another outstanding quality of The Wicker Man is the brilliant cast. Edward Woodward is excellent in the role of Sergeant Howie, who has little understanding for non-Christian beliefs. The character of Sergeant Howie is another brilliant aspect of the story. At first one does not really know whose side to be on - that of the dutiful but narrow-minded Sergeant, or that of the open-minded, but mysterious pagans. The incomparable Christopher Lee, one of the greatest actors ever in my opinion, delivers one of his greatest performances as the mysterious Lord Summerisle, another character which makes this film so brilliant and unique. The female cast includes Swedish beauty queen Britt Eckland as the innkeeper's seductive daughter Willow, Diane Cilento as the school teacher, and Ingrid Pitt, sexy leading woman of several Hammer Horror films, as a librarian. Actually, it must be said that all the performances are great here. Lee and Woodward, of course, range at the very top, and Britt Eckland is too beautiful to be true. All said, The Wicker Man has everything one could possibly desire in cinema, stunning suspense and genuine creepiness, complex mystery, delightfully bizarre weirdness, overwhelming settings and photography, brilliant performances and intriguing characters, beautiful and hypnotic music, and one of the most mesmerizing story lines ever in cinema. A remake was made in 2006, which I will never watch as the mere thought of it disgusts me. This 1973 original is one of the most unique, fascinating and compelling experiences a cineaste can have, one of the greatest British films of all-time and a masterpiece that no lover of cinema can afford to miss!

The Ymir is mainly portrayed, like Kong, as a sympathetic creature. His highly humanoid body also lets the viewer associate him with a creature possessing more than animal intelligence. Also, though speechless, his vocalizations are great.Probably the best scene takes place in an old barn, where the creature takes time out from fleeing from pesky humans to nibble on a bit of sulfur. He isn't let be for long as the farm dog charges into the barn and takes a bite out of crime. The director wisely shows this battle in shadow; I'm sure the dog would not have looked that believable as a miniature. Then when the pesky humans arrive, one guy decides to pitchfork the beast, and he receives a delicious come-uppance, and rather violent for the time. The Ymir beats him down and bites him several times. It's not bloody but high effective.The next best sequence shows the Ymir battling an elephant in the city streets. While a great rough n tumble fight, the elephant is not properly made to scale and unfortunately is too huge for his own good. The fleeing citizens are about twice as small around his crashing legs as they should be. But, given my admiration for the Ymir, I can overlook it as a serious flaw and just enjoy it.I've heard that for the film's 50th anniversary, the film was colorized. I haven't seen the colorized version and probably won't. This is a movie that works very well in black and white. I rank this high on my list of guilty pleasures. I hope it's never remade unless the designs for the Ymir are kept completely intact.

I'm amazed at all the pretentious, heavy psycho-analytical essays on this site from people who think it's a masterpiece. Give me a break, for God's sake! Yes it's a masterpiece, alright--a masterpiece of really bad film making! One of the silliest, most pretentious, pointless, dull, boring and generally stupid movies ever made. I found myself laughing throughout at the lame plot, ridiculous dialogue, and silly scenarios. If you wanted to hold a seminar on how to make a really bad movie, Blow Up would be a great example. First thing on the list the screenplay, which is just plain hopeless. Add to this the bad acting, cheesy music,and lousy editing. To be fair to the cast, however in the final analysis the one to blame for this piece of total absurdity is the director. Anyone who could make something like this and get taken seriously, must have a huge ego. Even his name Michelangelo Antonioni is pretentious. The only good things are the nifty cars and the shots of London in the sixties----and the fact that it does show how uptight and conservative things were at the time, when it was considered controversial and racy. I recently reviewed all the comments again, just to see where I rated. Boy, am I ever in the minority! Unfortunately I work in the movie business, so I don't look at movies with rose-colored glasses. Blow Up was on TV again recently, and I am even more convinced that it's one of the most ridiculous movies in history.

First i thought this could be a dull romance movie. But after reading the synopsis, it seems to grab my interest! But i'm not expecting a powerful storyline and great performances from this movie. The only reason why i bought this movie is because of Micheal Douglas and Robert Duvall.Here after i watched this movie, it was proved that i was wrong about this movie. This is one of the most important movie and most powerful movie i have ever watched in my whole life! The story is really great! Michael Douglas has given the best and most sensational performances in his career! Don't forget about Robert Duvall too... he's also important in turning this movie into a great classic! I really think that Douglas should win an Oscar for this movie...It's really sad after watching Douglas died at the end of the movie... i almost cry after watching this movie! It was Douglas who has brought up this movie! I'm not a real fan of Douglas, but this movie have proved that Douglas is one of the best actor in the 80's and 90's! 10\/10* (PERFECT & HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!)
