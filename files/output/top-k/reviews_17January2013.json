The direction and tone is breathtaking. The editing was great. His quick screen cuts with Thelma Schoonmaker is as brilliant as always. Poetic to the eyes. Cinematography was superb.His camera movements inside and outside of the ring is legendary. The black and white filming only adds to the beauty of the film. Brought class and design to the screen. I've read people complain about the fight scenes not being believable but I believe that was the inflection Scorsese was looking for. It was a mess in the ring. It was careless, unorganized, sloppy and devastating. Jake La Motta was a monster and the choreographed fight scenes spoke for him.The acting in this film was marvelous. What more could be said about Robert De Niro? He was magnificent. An Oscar winning performance. He's brilliant though the character he is portraying was far from it. Jake La Motta is a self-destructing man who is spiraling out of control. He is rude, impatient, paranoid and oh, so violent! Yet at the end of the film, you feel sorrow for such a monster. Joe Pesci is also great. He stands by his brother's side as long as he could. He is abused physically and emotionally in his home and in public. After a while, the audience begins to feel his pain. He is looked at like a clown by his own blood. But at the end, he has the final laugh. Great story telling.The score was fascinating. Scorsese went for a more classical genre in this picture. There's such carnage and menace through the film yet in the background you hear such beautiful music. It left me at a loss for words yet at the end, it worked. It worked like a charm. It brought class to such a brilliant and brutal story.Raging Bull is a masterpiece. I believe to be the best film to come out of the 80's.

If you are their friends they will look after you, but if you get on their wrong side, you won't live long enough to regret it.The casting was really good. Marlon Brando played the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone. This was the best role he has played that I have seen so far. Al Pacino played his son Michael. A brilliant performance. He looks so young in this film... I nearly didn't recognise him. James Caan played another son, Sonny. I am not a huge James Caan fan, but he did well in this movie.The Godfather is not the best gangster movie I have ever seen. I think Goodfellas is still the best in my opinion.

Many of the locations are closed to visitors, though, or are an nonmagical disappointment in person, unless you're a huge fan (Openshaw). When visited later, the filmed locations aren't nearly as exciting; the filmmakers were able to create magical scenes in everyday places. The sets in this magical film series add onto the reasons that everyone should see these films.Finally, movie watchers should see the films because of their amazing soundtracks. Hedwig's Theme Song is the theme song used in all the movies. A song analyzer wrote, Obviously, this piece has a great deal of chromatic movement for it to remain tonal (Hedwig's). This song is just one of the many instrumental pieces composed for the Harry Potter series. The soundtracks in these movies create a sense of imagination that any person should see! In conclusion, the Harry Potter movie series are great movies that should be seen by anyone that hasn't seen them. First, the cast is a group of very talented actors joined together to make great movies. Second, the costumes should be loved because they relate to the way viewers dress and create a sense of closeness to the actors. Third, the sets turn day to day places into lovable, magical places. Finally, the soundtracks were composed for the purpose of being loved and magical. Looking for a good movie? Or maybe 8? Watch the Harry Potter series, you should see them if you haven't already!

This scene works well. Clooney handles his part nicely. He never fails to know what to do and acts very quickly. Kidman keeps up with him.The movie glorifies the U.S. technical prowess. The depictions are unreal and fantastic, if not ridiculous. It makes for propaganda.Nuclear warheads on American soil in terrorist hands are the ultimate U.S. nightmare, and so that's what the movie shows.

For everyone else, this is an excellent period piece from 1969 that explores the nature of freedom and the quest thereof.Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper star as Wyatt and Billy, two hippies who travel by choppers from Los Angeles to New Orleans to attend the Mardi Gras. Along the way they experience gorgeous landscapes, a commune, jail, new friends, unexpected enemies, drugs galore and a whore house when they arrive.Jack Nicholson stands out as one of the friends they meet; while the beautiful Karen black & Toni Basil star as two prostitutes in New Orleans.What makes Easy Rider great is that it's more than just a road adventure with a modern Western garnish (i.e. cowboys on motorized horses). The film has depth that separates it from the typical biker flicks of that era. It's really about freedom or the lack thereof. Wyatt and Billy certainly have some grasp of freedom &#x96; and they desperately pursue it &#x96; but they're ironically so shackled by their OWN carnal desires and growing addictions that the most they attain is a piece of it. Wyatt laments near the end of the film We blew it; we really blew it as he realizes freedom has slipped through their fingers like water. Nicholson's character, George, has more of handle on what's going on, but he obviously has his own issues.The hippies at the commune seem to have escaped society's shackles but to what end? There's a reason communes never really caught on in America, and the film shows why.In an interview with Rolling Stone in the early 70s Fonda pointed out that Wyatt represented everybody who feels that freedom can be bought, that you can find freedom through other things, like riding motorcycles across the country or smoking pot. He confessed that Easy Rider is actually about the LACK of freedom in modern Western Civilization. Wyatt and Billy are not right, they're wrong. The only thing the writers (Fonda & Hopper) could do in the end was kill the characters. In a sense, committing self-destruction, which Fonda claimed America was doing. He said viewers often respond to the end by lamenting, Look at those terrible rednecks, they killed those two free souls, blah, blah, blah. But Easy Rider, he pointed out, is a Southern term for a whore's man, not a pimp, but the dude who lives with her. He's got the easy ride. And that's what he claims happened to America &#x96; liberty's become a whore, and we're all taking the easy ride.So what's the answer? The answer's there and it's pretty clear, but don't expect me to hand-feed it to you. Seek and you will find.In any event, this might give you some food for thought the next time you catch the film.Some modern viewers with ADHD criticize the film as boring, but I find it strangely engrossing from beginning to end.

She duly arrives in the form of Angelina Jolie. When she asks him why he wanted an American wife he answers, Here we are the past and there you are the future.He marries her, finds that he really loves her, is then deceived and robbed by her, seeks revenge but falls in love with her again only to be enmeshed in her deceitful lifestyle. It was a tall order to make it all work; the film bites off more than it can chew then chews like crazy for the rest of it's running time.Original Sin has enough packed into its 116 minutes to provide the material for a six-hour mini-series. The film is based on Waltz Into Darkness, a novel by Cornell Woolrich, who must rank just behind William Shakespeare for producing the largest number of works that have been turned into film.Original Sin is fast-paced, beautifully photographed, and features two charismatic stars &#x96; it all works perfectly as long as you just go along with it. Where the film runs into trouble is in consistency of tone, especially in the second half. But even if the only consistent tone in Original Sin is Angelina Jolie's nail enamel, part of the fascination is seeing how the filmmakers manage to get the story out of the many corners they have painted it into.One thing is for sure, Angelina Jolie dominates the screen. The filmmakers also showed a fascination with those famous lips; so much so that a couple of sequences start with a close-up of her lips before the camera pulls back to reveal the whole scene. In fact, she is photographed to great advantage in this film, and her Victorian era costumes suit her so well she looks as though she could sit for a portrait by John Singer Sargent the moment the director called cut.The interaction between Jolie and Banderas is fascinating and actually carries the movie over the rough spots in the plot. Calm and controlled, their performances have considerable depth despite the mounting implausibilities of the story. A couple of the supporting roles are also interesting; Australian Jack Thompson, who did brisk business around this time playing portly Southern gentlemen, plays Vargas' friend who warns him against Jolie's character. The other is Thomas Jane who plays a detective in a somewhat bizarre role.Original Sin is a throwback to an era in Hollywood filmmaking when the audience accepted a fairly far-fetched plot as long as it was wrapped in the gloss of fabulous stars and a lavish production. Anyone looking for reality in film can forget this one, but the two attractive stars light up the screen, and despite everything that has gone before, it has a satisfying ending that brings a smile to the face.

The trick with the truth is that sometimes we want to tell it but not to hear it, or vice versa. Do we really want to know what is said about us at the third person? Truth is a social double-edged sword, and lying a psychic boomerang, hitting you in the face when you don't expect it.This is why the main premise of a film like Liar, Liar where a man endures the curse of not lying, worse not being able to articulate one lousy syllabic that wouldn't tell the truth is not only hilarious, but intellectually challenging, as it incites us to question the place 'lying', occupies in our lives and daily agendas... and occasionally on America's judiciary system. Indeed, maybe the fact that the story focuses on a slick lawyer in Los Angeles, a sort of Lionel Hutz in flesh and blood and competence, asks a bit too much on the suspension of disbelief department, still what a premise, the kind that probably started with a simple what if&#x85; question and one wondered how no one ever got this idea before. It seems so clever, yet so simple, but it's not a laugh-riot guarantee either, my guess is that it's the kind of plot premises that can only work if you have the comical performance to efficiently conduct it from paper to screens. Think about that, a man can't lie, so what, what is funny? The fact that he can't lie can easily become redundant; it's all in the diversity of reactions then. And who's better than Jim Carrey to takes you by surprises even when you expect to laugh? Only Carrey could have been so hilariously, pathetically, frantically funny in his desperate attempts to let one single lie comes out of his mouth, especially the day of a very tough divorce and child custody trial.Jim Carrey delivers his funniest performance, and certainly one of the funniest of the 90's, Adam Sandler? Chris Farley? Liar, Liar is the ultimate proof that Carrey is the real thing when it comes to comedy. Carrey's face is a gift from Cinematic Gods, hell, you don't even need CGI, it's like every parcel of his face is capable of displaying more hilarious elasticity than all the comics of his generation combined in all of their films. Liar, Liar is 80 minutes of demonstration, of Carrey's talent and comical superiority. Naturally, it's not just all about grimaces, funny faces or scream, like the best comedies, Liar, Liar has a heart and maintains an overwhelming everyday feeling, we're enjoying Carrey's talent, but still, we think of our own lives&#x85; or lies.Marking the return of Jim Carrey after the film 'that almost ruined his career' according to Homer Simpson, Liar, Liar is the second collaboration with Tom Shadyak after Ace Ventura Pet Detective in 1994, the breakthrough year where he starred in 3 movies from the Box- office Top 10. He made it again with Liar, Liar, for all the zaniness, Jim Carrey played a more mature, and identifiable character through Fletcher Reed, half liar, half lawyer (a clever opening joke probably lost in translation in all the foreign versions). While it does flirt a little bit with the too-busy-to-see-his-son father cliché, it avoids it by focusing on lying, this is Fletcher's problem, he can't see his child because he just built his whole life, professional, social and familial, on lying.And when the kid gets one lie too much, he blows the candle of his birthday cake and makes the wish that his father can't lie during 24 hours, the curse applies immediately with the hilarious sex aftermath comment followed by the unforgettable drool-inducing elevator scene. Indeed, this scene speaks for all the men who tried to maintain eye-control in front of a nice pair of juicy &#x85; well, that's our mind whispering to us, and Fletcher's nightmare is that it's his mind controlling his words. And while transposing his case to my personal life, I wondered to what extent my life would have been different if I had one day without lying. I even shudder thinking to the eventuality of my wife asking me some questions about my past. Of course, it's just a film, but still.So, as soon as the curse operates, the movie takes off for a magnificent, flamboyant bravura performance from Jim Carrey, one gag after another, making the little archetypes, from the cute Justin Cooper with the worst haircut ever to Maura Tierney, the comprehensive divorced wife who still has feelings toward her ex-husband and the dull and boring replacer, Cary Elwes doing well in a rather ungrateful role, not to mention the scene-stealing Jennifer Tilly as the slutty ambitious unfaithful wife, they all become insignificant, because it's Carrey's film. And Carrey carries it with the power of his face, and a terrific script, one that visits every kind of situation where the 'to lie or not to lie' dilemma plays a pivotal role, even one that allows Fletcher to relieve himself by roasting everyone during an unforgettable board meeting, literally the film's laugh-out-loudest moment. And we catch our breath during some genuine moments of true father- and-son tenderness showcasing an unknown capability for seriousness, something the previous movies didn't show. And Liar, Liar probably played a vital and pivotal role in Carrey's career, proving he was at ease with slapstick humor (damn, I can't get the face he had with the luggage thing stuck in his face) and emotions too, a versatility that would be confirmed in The Truman Show one year later. And Liar, Liar concludes with a nice moral, if you build your life on lies, it might collapse sooner or later, if did for Fletcher, but the essential remained, and he would finally value it.

And with all the trademarks of style, story, and character. On top of that, it's really good! I can watch any low grade bad film noir and like it, but this one is for everyone. Fast, crazy, dramatic, beautiful. And with such sparkling noir dialog you want to see it twice. In a row.The premise here is that a jade necklace has gone missing and a man hires detective Philip Marlowe to be bodyguard when he goes to buy it back. Things go wrong, but lucky for Marlowe he is now on the inside of a duplicitous bunch of thugs, many of them part of one family. It gets confusing if you don't listen closely and don't get the noir slang, but you realize you don't totally need to follow every nuance of the plot. It's also largely about style, about how this is all told and played out for the cameras.There are a handful of formative early film noirs going back to The Maltese Falcon which has some echoes to this one. Most are based on detective stories like this one by Raymond Chandler. Like most mystery or detective fiction, there is a formula at work, a huge dependency on one main character and his point of view, and a slightly contrived plot without deep emotional stakes. Later noirs can get more personal and involving emotionally (like Out of the Past or even the 1945 Mildred Pierce) but the point of view of the protagonist is still important because it's from a lonely position as the world swirls around. The detective was a perfect starting point for this genre--detectives work alone, after all, and see things the rest of us never dream of.So Marlowe gets taken for quite a ride. Dick Powell is terrific in the role. He's no Bogart or Mitchum, and he's no looker (no Dana Andrews). And so he becomes a really regular guy, someone you can relate to. He's tough and savvy and he has a great sense of humor in his interior monologues (another feature of noirs, used heavily here). And when he's abused you feel less like it's a Hollywood star up there but just a character. It works well.There are some really inventive visual things happening. The first happens several times, with black inky pools taking over the screen when he gets knocked out. But there are other distortions, and a fabulous (if technically simple) hallucination sequence that surely had some small influence on Hitchcock in making Vertigo. When you finally get to the end of this whole up and down adventure you've been a lot of places quickly. It's quite a movie.Don't expect normal realism. The movie is stylized and made to be illustrative, even as it gets gritty and real. The whole situation is a bit improbable, but forget likelihood. Go for the ride yourself. Get into the dialog (which is as classic as it gets). And watch it. Or watch it twice.Oh, and if you want a treat, check out the weird and actually terrific remake, hard to find on DVD, with Robert Mitchum in rich noir color called Farewell, My Lovely.

It gets confusing if you don't listen closely and don't get the noir slang, but you realize you don't totally need to follow every nuance of the plot. It's also largely about style, about how this is all told and played out for the cameras.There are a handful of formative early film noirs going back to The Maltese Falcon which has some echoes to this one. Most are based on detective stories like this one by Raymond Chandler. Like most mystery or detective fiction, there is a formula at work, a huge dependency on one main character and his point of view, and a slightly contrived plot without deep emotional stakes. Later noirs can get more personal and involving emotionally (like Out of the Past or even the 1945 Mildred Pierce) but the point of view of the protagonist is still important because it's from a lonely position as the world swirls around. The detective was a perfect starting point for this genre--detectives work alone, after all, and see things the rest of us never dream of.So Marlowe gets taken for quite a ride. Dick Powell is terrific in the role. He's no Bogart or Mitchum, and he's no looker (no Dana Andrews). And so he becomes a really regular guy, someone you can relate to. He's tough and savvy and he has a great sense of humor in his interior monologues (another feature of noirs, used heavily here). And when he's abused you feel less like it's a Hollywood star up there but just a character. It works well.There are some really inventive visual things happening. The first happens several times, with black inky pools taking over the screen when he gets knocked out. But there are other distortions, and a fabulous (if technically simple) hallucination sequence that surely had some small influence on Hitchcock in making Vertigo. When you finally get to the end of this whole up and down adventure you've been a lot of places quickly. It's quite a movie.Don't expect normal realism. The movie is stylized and made to be illustrative, even as it gets gritty and real. The whole situation is a bit improbable, but forget likelihood. Go for the ride yourself. Get into the dialog (which is as classic as it gets). And watch it. Or watch it twice.Oh, and if you want a treat, check out the weird and actually terrific remake, hard to find on DVD, with Robert Mitchum in rich noir color called Farewell, My Lovely. With Charlotte Rampling, no less.

One of the biggest issues here is the fact that, despite initially being targeted to be a commentary on the clichéd nature of horror, Slasher films in general, it seems to be more about offering a chance to utilize those clichés rather than poke fun at them. Far too often it expends a great deal of time to warn about a particular situation familiar in horror, such as running up the stairs to escape the killer or that he's not dead at all and comes back for one more scare despite being the subject of inhuman torture, then decides to play off a sequence that allows for such a moment to transpire. As well, many of the claims about this being funny are incredibly inaccurate as there's absolutely nothing in here that's really funny material, and the stuff that's here which is being called funny is reprehensible, deplorable and quite a stretch for anyone to call funny stuff. As such, it's the shining example that a reputation is far more damaging to a film than anything. That said, it does have some good stuff in some particularly chilling chases and stalking scenes including the rousing opening, some incredibly brutal, gory deaths and some fine moments of real suspense that are far more developed than expected.
