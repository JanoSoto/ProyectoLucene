It wasn't just a boring, derived big-screen adaptation of some cartoon - it is evident that the producers and creators had their inspiration, what with the school being turned into some sort of futuristic sci-fi base. It would never happen in real life, but the fantasy of this film shows that people actually wanted to make this film, rather than having to make it just to satisfy all Recess fans. And the flashbacks to the 60s only help matters and give the film a really interesting plot, with real character being revealed. If only Prickly and TJ's escape from their cage could have been slightly better thought up and executed, I would have given it a 10. This film really helped develop on the characters from the original show - all of TJ's gang actually showing some ambitions in life (eg. space camp, baseball camp, army camp), and Prickly not being the cruel, harsh principal he was made out to be. The film did not do badly at all - I hope its current average rating of 5.9 starts to increase. Because this film actually had some inspiration and was very funny - highly-trained guards and police being outfoxed and beaten by schoolchildren, anyone? More cartoon big screen adaptations should be like this - this felt not like one overlong episode, but a proper movie in its own right. And I definitely enjoyed it.

Twister has a ride there. And even though the ride is only there because Twister's huge explosions and scenes of chaos would work well at a theme park and frighten the nippers, it's still not a bad film. None of the science makes sense, and even though the invention that our main characters have built is interesting and easy to understand, it isn't the most exciting of things, and the end does get a bit silly - crushed up Coke cans being used as probes, anyone? But as I've said, most people care about it for the explosions only. And Twister sure delivers on the action. The start of the film is brilliantly intense (if a bit silly) - and is explained to us later in the film in a highly emotional scene - it has a link to one of the main characters. And that is the only scene which tries for sentimentality - which is good, because if the whole film tried to be a gory tear-fest (*cough*Saving Private Ryan*cough*), it would have been ruined. Character development is tried upon, but you won't really care about any of the characters by the end - you'll only want to see them going through hellish weather anyway. Some of it is breathtaking and fabulously done - take the scene where the main character scientist guy (I've forgotten his name - that's how much the action rams the characters out of your mind) and his girlfriend (forgotten her name too - and I'm not even sure if she's actually his girlfriend) have to drive straight through a house which has landed in the middle of the road (yes, it really did happen) - and some of it is a bit silly, like the cow flying through the air (this could happen in real life, but not with the results shown), but it is all action-packed and very fun, even if not that environmentally conscious.

Dr. Alexander McCabe, (Bob Gunton) reveals that they're genetically altered bats, forcing Sheriff Emmett Kimsey, (Lou Diamond Phillips) to call a town evacuation. When the order goes unnoticed, the bats attack the small town and the citizens, causing massive panic. Finally calling in the military, the survivors work together to stop the bats from spreading around the country if they escape.The Good News There are some pretty decent good points in this one. The bats here are actually pretty good, and they're really believable. Abandoning the CGI commonly used for these types of films. The puppets look pretty realistic, and their close-ups make them out to be pretty terrifying to a degree. That also helps out in a mildly effective shot. The bats swarm over a truck containing several characters when a second one comes up and they suddenly become aware of the new vehicle and come to an abrupt, silent stop. They then turn their heads towards the car and its headlights, so that all their eyes light up a malevolent yellow. This is one of the best shots and looks quite menacing and effective. The main attack sequence in the middle of the movie, where a large swarm of bats attacks the population in the middle of town, causing general panic and mayhem. The large amount of action, including causing a character to run and crash through a glass door while being attacked and a car crashes into an electrical pole, sending it down to the street, while other vehicles crash into each other, causing them to explode and burn. Another vehicle crashes into a ticket booth. The fact that it plays out over a long period of time is quite nice, allowing for a lot of great action and gore to pop in. Also on the upside is that it's a little refreshing to see a movie like this having everybody agreeing that the problem is bats right from the start. Rather than having the clichéd extended argument among people who had clear evidence that it was bats and someone like the chief cop constantly butt heads over what the culprit is until it had a physical attack done in front of everyone to convince them. This is a nice change of pace. Still, let's give credit where it's due. The last segment shows a bat burrowing out of the ground, and just as it breaks completely free, the heroes' truck comes along and they unknowingly run over and squash it. So they did have enough wit to make fun of those annoying 'it's not over yet' endings. With some mild gore and a really fast and quite watchable pace to it, this is a lot better than it's been made out to be.The Bad News This here does have some problems. There are several confusing parts of this. Every time there was some sort of dramatic bat attack, the camera would go off on some sort of hyped up whirlwind trip of herky jerky motion. This is what keeps it from being scary or creepy, as the attack scenes become mush because we don't even get to see what's going on in the scene the cuts are so quick. This the film provides in spades, since you often can't tell what the heck is happening on screen. It is definitely the picture for those who find the videos on MTV too stately and static. Making the technique even more obnoxious is that it's used pretty much throughout the entire film. The origin of the bats is also a little confusing. All we know is that bats are attacking. How they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery. The other big problem here is that the bats suffer from an annoying flaw in logic that modified animals are not just more intelligent, but that they mysteriously acquire knowledge of matters completely outside their range of experience. Here, a bat that has been trapped and tagged with a tracking device then is hunted down and killed by the modified bats, who know that the device will give away their colony's position. When they get trapped in a truck, the bats are able to deduce the schematics on the workings of a mechanical object, and it's not something they would be familiar with. These bring the film down slightly from what it could've been.The Final Verdict While there's some problems here, this is overall not as bad as it's been made out to be.

The bats here are actually pretty good, and they're really believable. Abandoning the CGI commonly used for these types of films. The puppets look pretty realistic, and their close-ups make them out to be pretty terrifying to a degree. That also helps out in a mildly effective shot. The bats swarm over a truck containing several characters when a second one comes up and they suddenly become aware of the new vehicle and come to an abrupt, silent stop.

The main attack sequence in the middle of the movie, where a large swarm of bats attacks the population in the middle of town, causing general panic and mayhem. The large amount of action, including causing a character to run and crash through a glass door while being attacked and a car crashes into an electrical pole, sending it down to the street, while other vehicles crash into each other, causing them to explode and burn. Another vehicle crashes into a ticket booth. The fact that it plays out over a long period of time is quite nice, allowing for a lot of great action and gore to pop in. Also on the upside is that it's a little refreshing to see a movie like this having everybody agreeing that the problem is bats right from the start. Rather than having the clichéd extended argument among people who had clear evidence that it was bats and someone like the chief cop constantly butt heads over what the culprit is until it had a physical attack done in front of everyone to convince them. This is a nice change of pace. Still, let's give credit where it's due. The last segment shows a bat burrowing out of the ground, and just as it breaks completely free, the heroes' truck comes along and they unknowingly run over and squash it. So they did have enough wit to make fun of those annoying 'it's not over yet' endings. With some mild gore and a really fast and quite watchable pace to it, this is a lot better than it's been made out to be.The Bad News This here does have some problems. There are several confusing parts of this. Every time there was some sort of dramatic bat attack, the camera would go off on some sort of hyped up whirlwind trip of herky jerky motion. This is what keeps it from being scary or creepy, as the attack scenes become mush because we don't even get to see what's going on in the scene the cuts are so quick. This the film provides in spades, since you often can't tell what the heck is happening on screen. It is definitely the picture for those who find the videos on MTV too stately and static. Making the technique even more obnoxious is that it's used pretty much throughout the entire film. The origin of the bats is also a little confusing. All we know is that bats are attacking. How they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery. The other big problem here is that the bats suffer from an annoying flaw in logic that modified animals are not just more intelligent, but that they mysteriously acquire knowledge of matters completely outside their range of experience. Here, a bat that has been trapped and tagged with a tracking device then is hunted down and killed by the modified bats, who know that the device will give away their colony's position. When they get trapped in a truck, the bats are able to deduce the schematics on the workings of a mechanical object, and it's not something they would be familiar with.

The movie starts off in the very dark and atmospheric home where young innocent Casey Becker(Drew Barrymore) awaits her boyfriend's arrival. What she does not know is that he won't be coming at least not in the way she predicted.What I really LOVE about this scene is the suspense of the first scene. It actually ran chill bumps down my back. Drew was terrific in this scene and so was Roger's menacing voice. I also love the part where she can't talk but she's like 10 feet away from her parents. That's what movie creativity is all about my friends. On the sad side Drew ends up getting it, she gets it BAD and so does her boyfriend. I do believe this is one of the best opening scenes in horror movie history(behind Halloween and Black Christmas'74).Later in the film Sid now realizes that the guy who killed her mom is the same guy who took out Becker. Another thing I like about this movie are the characters. Never in my viewing of horror movies have I said I like everyone in this movie. Tis true, Neve Campbell gave an amazing performance and was a great heroine. Skeet Ulrich was great as the red herring boyfriend. Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy added that comedy spice to this film that I love. Rose McGowan was terrific to as a hot best friend of Sid. Even the Kenny The Camera man was cool.I also enjoyed the very creative death applied to this such as Casey's and Tatum's garage death. The ending is still one of my favorite parts. I craved to know who was the killer in the Randy and Stu scene. Then we find out the killers. That's right there's more than one folks, it's Billy Loomis and Stu Macher. Billy Loomis was all ticked off because Sid's mother had an affair with his father causing his mother to abandon him. Stu Macher....well....Stu was just out of his mind. I like these two as a combo. I found Stu to be hilarious and Billy looks really psycho. I really like the Norman Bates line revealing Billy is the killer and I liked Stu's as well.Buy Scream on DVD.

Actor and Director Clint Eastwood is probably one of the most knowledgeable artists about the Western genre, as his acting career began as the legendary Man With No Name in the Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s. As a director, he somewhat continued this legacy through movies like High Plains Drifter and Pale Rider, but finally in 1992, Eastwood released what many consider his final ode to the Western, and his ultimate masterpiece of the genre Unforgiven, an epic saga about the deconstruction of the Western myths.Clint Eastwood himself plays William Munny, a former gunslinger who is now living a peaceful life as a farmer with his two children. However, life is very difficult for Munny's family, as since the death of his wife the family has been facing financial problems. One day a young man calling himself The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) appears looking for Munny. The Kid tells Munny about a bounty offered in the town of Big Whisky, and offers him the chance to join him as hired gun and split the reward between them. While Munny's days as a murderer are in the past, he decides to join him after thinking about the farm's problems, but not without calling his old friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) to join them. However, Munny's past as a notorious thief and murderer will return to haunt him in this last mission, as the Kid shows a true and honest admiration for Munny's fame as a gunslinger, even when Munny himself considers his past as villainous.While better known for his work in science fiction, David Webb Peoples' screenplay proves to be a very accurate description of life in the American west, particularly concerning the aspects of the uses and abuses of violence in that era. It is in fact the use of violence what comes as the main theme of the story, as Munny is escaping from his past's violence while the Kid is eagerly awaiting the next chance to prove his masculinity by the use of violence. The duality between man and myth is explored not only via the relationship between the Kid and Munny, but also in the shape of a character who writes novels about the wild west, and sees the figure of the gunslinger as an idolized modern hero. Peoples' screenplay is remarkably well written, as the many characters and their relationships are exhaustively explored, resulting in a character driven revisionism of the western, that in many ways criticizes the genre's origins as violent Shoot 'em up films.Peoples' script is definitely the movie's backbone, but it is Eastwood's masterful direction what transforms this meditation of violence into a unique revision of the Western. With a gritty and realistic approach very in tone with the script, Eastwood portraits the Wild West without romanticism and leaving out the mythic aspects of the genre, taking the revisionism of the Western one step beyond. Using Peoples' script, Eastwood takes a critic view on the figure of the hero in Westerns, focusing on the image of the gunslinger and the use of violence to solve problems. Visually, Eastwood has crafted his most impressive movie since Bird, with an extensive use of shadows and light in the excellent work of cinematography by Jack N. Green. Eastwood's style, originated by the influence of Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, and developed through many stages seems to finally have spawned its masterpiece in this film.As William Munny, Clint Eastwood is simply perfect in what at first sight looks like an extension of his earlier Man with no name persona. William Munny has a name, and a past he wants to escape from, and Estwood captures the image of guilt and regret to the letter. This is easily one of his best roles to date. Morgan Freeman is also very good as Ned Logan, although like Jaimz Woolvett (who plays The Schofield Kid), gets easily overshadowed by Gene Hackman's powerful performance as Little Bill Daggett. Hackman completely owns every scene he is in, showcasing his enormous talent in a very dramatic role. The legendary Richard Harris has a small appearance as another aging gunslinger, English Bob, in very memorable scenes where he demonstrates why he is considered one of the best actors of his generation.After starting his career playing a mythical hero in Leone's Dollars trilogy, it is actually fitting that is Eastwood who explores the figure of hero in his many movies. Ever since his first directed western, Eastwood showed an interest in the duality of the hero, taking a special interest in the archetype of hero portrayed in the classic 1953 Western, Shane. Eastwood has explored this theme in many ways in the past first as a true antihero (High Plains Drifter), then as a man becoming legend (The Outlaw Josey Wales) and later as a true mythic hero (Pale Rider); all this culminates in Unforgiven as the ultimate demythologization of the concept, and his final ode to the Western genre. While the movie indeed feels a bit preachy at times, the story is devised in such a way that it never feels too heavy handed, as it unfolds nicely as a classic epic tale of the West.Personally, I can't praise this movie enough, as it is easily one of the best Westerns done since Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, and required viewing not only for fans of the genre. While some consider it an anti-Western, I think that with this movie, Eastwood's name can proudly stand along those of Ford, Hawks, Leone and Peckinpah as a master of the Western. Unforgiven is definitely Clint's masterpiece. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 February 2007","score":"70 out of 88 people found the following review useful","review":" Ford, Hawks, Leone, Peckinpah, all of them big names who have defined the Western genre in one way or another across the history of cinema, transforming what started as low-budget action films into an art itself where the American Old West served as setting for tales of mythical heroism, classic tragedies, and legendary adventures.

However, Munny's past as a notorious thief and murderer will return to haunt him in this last mission, as the Kid shows a true and honest admiration for Munny's fame as a gunslinger, even when Munny himself considers his past as villainous.While better known for his work in science fiction, David Webb Peoples' screenplay proves to be a very accurate description of life in the American west, particularly concerning the aspects of the uses and abuses of violence in that era. It is in fact the use of violence what comes as the main theme of the story, as Munny is escaping from his past's violence while the Kid is eagerly awaiting the next chance to prove his masculinity by the use of violence. The duality between man and myth is explored not only via the relationship between the Kid and Munny, but also in the shape of a character who writes novels about the wild west, and sees the figure of the gunslinger as an idolized modern hero. Peoples' screenplay is remarkably well written, as the many characters and their relationships are exhaustively explored, resulting in a character driven revisionism of the western, that in many ways criticizes the genre's origins as violent Shoot 'em up films.Peoples' script is definitely the movie's backbone, but it is Eastwood's masterful direction what transforms this meditation of violence into a unique revision of the Western. With a gritty and realistic approach very in tone with the script, Eastwood portraits the Wild West without romanticism and leaving out the mythic aspects of the genre, taking the revisionism of the Western one step beyond. Using Peoples' script, Eastwood takes a critic view on the figure of the hero in Westerns, focusing on the image of the gunslinger and the use of violence to solve problems. Visually, Eastwood has crafted his most impressive movie since Bird, with an extensive use of shadows and light in the excellent work of cinematography by Jack N. Green. Eastwood's style, originated by the influence of Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, and developed through many stages seems to finally have spawned its masterpiece in this film.As William Munny, Clint Eastwood is simply perfect in what at first sight looks like an extension of his earlier Man with no name persona. William Munny has a name, and a past he wants to escape from, and Estwood captures the image of guilt and regret to the letter. This is easily one of his best roles to date. Morgan Freeman is also very good as Ned Logan, although like Jaimz Woolvett (who plays The Schofield Kid), gets easily overshadowed by Gene Hackman's powerful performance as Little Bill Daggett. Hackman completely owns every scene he is in, showcasing his enormous talent in a very dramatic role. The legendary Richard Harris has a small appearance as another aging gunslinger, English Bob, in very memorable scenes where he demonstrates why he is considered one of the best actors of his generation.After starting his career playing a mythical hero in Leone's Dollars trilogy, it is actually fitting that is Eastwood who explores the figure of hero in his many movies. Ever since his first directed western, Eastwood showed an interest in the duality of the hero, taking a special interest in the archetype of hero portrayed in the classic 1953 Western, Shane. Eastwood has explored this theme in many ways in the past first as a true antihero (High Plains Drifter), then as a man becoming legend (The Outlaw Josey Wales) and later as a true mythic hero (Pale Rider); all this culminates in Unforgiven as the ultimate demythologization of the concept, and his final ode to the Western genre. While the movie indeed feels a bit preachy at times, the story is devised in such a way that it never feels too heavy handed, as it unfolds nicely as a classic epic tale of the West.Personally, I can't praise this movie enough, as it is easily one of the best Westerns done since Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, and required viewing not only for fans of the genre. While some consider it an anti-Western, I think that with this movie, Eastwood's name can proudly stand along those of Ford, Hawks, Leone and Peckinpah as a master of the Western. Unforgiven is definitely Clint's masterpiece. 10\/10 ","genre":"Western"},{"date":"19 February 2007","score":"70 out of 88 people found the following review useful","review":" Ford, Hawks, Leone, Peckinpah, all of them big names who have defined the Western genre in one way or another across the history of cinema, transforming what started as low-budget action films into an art itself where the American Old West served as setting for tales of mythical heroism, classic tragedies, and legendary adventures. Actor and Director Clint Eastwood is probably one of the most knowledgeable artists about the Western genre, as his acting career began as the legendary Man With No Name in the Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s. As a director, he somewhat continued this legacy through movies like High Plains Drifter and Pale Rider, but finally in 1992, Eastwood released what many consider his final ode to the Western, and his ultimate masterpiece of the genre Unforgiven, an epic saga about the deconstruction of the Western myths.Clint Eastwood himself plays William Munny, a former gunslinger who is now living a peaceful life as a farmer with his two children. However, life is very difficult for Munny's family, as since the death of his wife the family has been facing financial problems. One day a young man calling himself The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) appears looking for Munny. The Kid tells Munny about a bounty offered in the town of Big Whisky, and offers him the chance to join him as hired gun and split the reward between them.

Henry's (Ray Liotta) grandest dream as a young boy is to someday become a gangster. As he says, being a gangster was better than being president of the United States. He grows up in a neighborhood full of them, and even gets a job at the cabstand which gains him respect among his peers. (During all of this, his parents become aware of his interaction with the other mobsters, and his dad cruelly beats him.) He continues to work and become more familiar with the neighborhood, including Paulie (Paul Sorvino) who he becomes very close to later on. Eventually, he is introduced to Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) who he begins working for soon selling cigarettes. From here, he first meets Tommy DeVito, who he will also become extremely close with later on along with Paulie. Unfortunately for Henry, he is caught selling one day and is immediately arrested. Luckily, Henry is smart enough to not reveal anything, and he is acquitted of the charges. Later on, the story moves into Henry's adult life where he continues robbing the airport and other places with his close friend Tommy (Joe Pesci). We learn more about Tommy from this point. What we learn more than anything else is how insane he is. He is obviously a complete psycho, and at his worst he kills people just for kicks. Over time, Henry begins dating Karen (Lorraine Bracco) who, while she seems close to him, is infuriated when one day he decides not to show up for a date. She stands him up, and this is when the connection between the two of them is soon about more than just a date.Over time, Henry marries Karen and they have two daughters. Henry's work starts getting more serious, and occasionally they have fights which result in Karen almost killing him. Tragically, Henry and his friends' killings go over the line and result in ***SPOILERS!!!*** Tommy's death.***END SPOILERS!!!*** Henry becomes a cocaine dealer and addict (despite Paulie's warning that if he messes around with it too much he'll disregard him forever) and earns a fortune from it. But, what he and Karen don't realize is that narcs are fully aware of his actions, and they arrest him one day. When they arrive on the scene, Karen, in panic, thinks that they are actual cops and flushes all of Henry's cocaine down the toilet (all of which is worth about $60,000).

Zemeckis has stated this from the beginning. FedEx is not the main thrust of the movie anyway. It is merely the means whereby we come to see Chuck's transformation from time-obsessed employee to a deep, introspective thinker who is more emotionally mature than before his time on the island. Additionally, the schtick about the package being delivered at all costs is wrong. He wasn't delivering the package to its intended destination; he was returning it to sender.Also, the claims that the movie is poorly written are off base. Part of the reason there is little dialogue is that Chuck has been alone for a long time and has developed the ability to convey meaning and communication with very subtle changes in expression. The main complaint about the ending is that Chuck simply stands in the middle of the crossroads with a stupid expression on his face and doesn't do anything or go anywhere (nor, even know where he is going). This is not the case. If you notice at the beginning when he picks up the package (and first sees the angel wings), there is a sign over the entrance to the farm that says Dick and Bettina. When he returns it to sender later, check out the sign. Dick's name is gone (he's either died or been kicked to the curb). After he drops off the package and Bettina gives him directions (he is at first clueless about her identity), he is still thinking about what to do.

You follow him through his life, from the time that he was a young colt (and the darned cutest thing you ever did see) until his old age. The narrator of the story is Black Beauty himself. He will open your eyes to the treatment that animals receive at the hands of their masters -- a problem that is not unique to writer Anna Sewells' time. Spoilers for the book and movie Some may complain that movies based on books always stray far from the original plot. In most cases, this is extremely true. In the case of Black Beauty, the greatest and most irritating change, I found, was the fact that the horses could not communicate with each other. They whinnied and neighed, but they never spoke English. In Anna Sewells' book, Beauty held conversations with nearly every horse he met. However, I liked this change in the movie. It is fine to hear Beauty narrate, but I found the movie much more convincing without the horses talking. An adult is most likely not going to jump at the chance to watch a movie with live horses communicating like that, never mind watch long enough to get the message of the movie. I think that this was a change for the better, even though it then cut out some of the characters and a few heart-rending lines (my favorite Captain's speech about war -- it gets me every time). End SpoilersThis movie is never found wanting in any way. Be warned This is not an action movie. Those with short attention spans will probably not enjoy it. While Beauty goes through some terrifying moments, remember that a horse is narrating. However, it is my personal opinion that even when there is a decrease in action, the movie absolutely wonderful -- maybe even better than some action scenes. You may also need a box of tissues. Because (I suppose) I grew up watching it and practically had it memorized by age five, I never cried, but it is still a tear-jerking movie. There are few people who don't get teary at moments.As a child, I loved the film. When I was four years old, I'd sit and watch it repeatedly. Even now, the movie still enthralls me and is considered one of my favorites. It is a classic that I will treasure forever and pass down through generations. SpoilersThe casting could not have been better. Alan Cumming has the perfect voice for Beauty -- mellow and world-weary. You can feel his excitement at those moments when Beauty is reliving his first run and his fear when the barn catches fire. You sympathize with his wariness and confusion when (I believe) Reuben Smith tries to ride him drunk. Alan Cumming put his heart and soul into Beauty. He was perfect for the role.Eleanor Bron is a fantastic Lady Wexmire. She is great at playing those cruel characters (as seen in A Little Princess as well) and she is very convincing. While I like her as an actress, I absolutely despise her in the film, which is the point of her character. She was like Cruella de Vil from another time.The rest of the cast was wonderful as well. Everyone was extremely gifted in the acting department and were great in their roles. This movie is highly recommended! It is a must-see. Do not discard it as PETA propaganda or a child's story -- it is so much more than that. It is a masterpiece in its own right.

While Beauty goes through some terrifying moments, remember that a horse is narrating. However, it is my personal opinion that even when there is a decrease in action, the movie absolutely wonderful -- maybe even better than some action scenes. You may also need a box of tissues. Because (I suppose) I grew up watching it and practically had it memorized by age five, I never cried, but it is still a tear-jerking movie. There are few people who don't get teary at moments.As a child, I loved the film. When I was four years old, I'd sit and watch it repeatedly. Even now, the movie still enthralls me and is considered one of my favorites. It is a classic that I will treasure forever and pass down through generations. SpoilersThe casting could not have been better. Alan Cumming has the perfect voice for Beauty -- mellow and world-weary. You can feel his excitement at those moments when Beauty is reliving his first run and his fear when the barn catches fire. You sympathize with his wariness and confusion when (I believe) Reuben Smith tries to ride him drunk. Alan Cumming put his heart and soul into Beauty. He was perfect for the role.Eleanor Bron is a fantastic Lady Wexmire. She is great at playing those cruel characters (as seen in A Little Princess as well) and she is very convincing. While I like her as an actress, I absolutely despise her in the film, which is the point of her character. She was like Cruella de Vil from another time.The rest of the cast was wonderful as well. Everyone was extremely gifted in the acting department and were great in their roles. This movie is highly recommended! It is a must-see. Do not discard it as PETA propaganda or a child's story -- it is so much more than that. It is a masterpiece in its own right.

You follow him through his life, from the time that he was a young colt (and the darned cutest thing you ever did see) until his old age. The narrator of the story is Black Beauty himself. He will open your eyes to the treatment that animals receive at the hands of their masters -- a problem that is not unique to writer Anna Sewells' time. Spoilers for the book and movie Some may complain that movies based on books always stray far from the original plot. In most cases, this is extremely true. In the case of Black Beauty, the greatest and most irritating change, I found, was the fact that the horses could not communicate with each other. They whinnied and neighed, but they never spoke English. In Anna Sewells' book, Beauty held conversations with nearly every horse he met. However, I liked this change in the movie. It is fine to hear Beauty narrate, but I found the movie much more convincing without the horses talking. An adult is most likely not going to jump at the chance to watch a movie with live horses communicating like that, never mind watch long enough to get the message of the movie. I think that this was a change for the better, even though it then cut out some of the characters and a few heart-rending lines (my favorite Captain's speech about war -- it gets me every time).

Admittedly, not the best you've ever seen, but overall, it does have an atmosphere you can't but like. It's a romanticized view of hackers, depicting them as a cool subculture not harming anyone, but also showing the potential threat they can become. Although an older film, the computers they used at the time were more or less up to date, which is all the more credit to them (compared with the simple mistake made in Simone). I absolutely like Angelina Jolie in the role of Acid Burn. She's so much more natural than in her later films, but already shows the tough chick personality and spirit so well known from her later performances. Johnny Lee Miller (probably best known from Trainspotting, at least to me) isn't too bad either. There is chemistry between them. Matthew Lillard does what he can do best be the most flamboyant character in the film. You can't but love him. The plot is simple and well known, someone has to clear their name for something they didn't do. As for the soundtrack, it fits seamlessly in with the atmosphere the film breathes, and consists of Orbital, Prodigy and Urban Dance Squad, amongst others. All in all, I had a really fun time watching this film.
