[{"date":"24 August 2012","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" The most striking thing about The Blair Witch Project is that the ending strikes you two seconds later, when the end credits begin. For a moment, your mind reels back to the preceding events and you realize how terrific and terrifying the moment is. Paranormal Activity, released much later may have more jump scenes, but nothing in the movie, not even the spooky as hell climax is as intense as Blair Witch's last fifteen or so seconds. If you think I am going to say 'The ending is great but the rest isn't', you are incorrect. Comments such as 'The worst movie ever', 'I hated this film', 'Indie crap' are written as usual without much justification, and that some call the characters 'absolutely unlikeable' is a thing I find utterly baffling.Three newcomers &#x96; one a Shakespearean actress (Heather Donahue), another an experienced independent director (Joshua Leonard) and the other a theater actor (Michael C. Williams) not just act but also film most of their scenes in an isolated forest area using a 16mm and handicam and not just that, the actors were not aware of what was to happen in the woods since the directors didn't tell them what would happen next in their scenes. In the director's commentary, one realizes how spontaneously the three amigos (not exactly 'amigos', just using it because it sounds sweet, sad and ironic) improvised their scenes in order to extract realistic performances. Donahue, who won the Razzie Award for Worst Actress for an act that should've clinched her a Golden Globe nomination, is believed to have modeled her character on a director with whom she had worked with. With such experimentation, such capable acting and such fine editing, I am simply astonished that the word 'worst' is attributed to The Blair Witch Project. 'Unlikable characters'? So if the characters were unlikable, then the reviewers should've loved the film since they 'got what they deserved' according to them &#x96; similar to the unlikable characters of Final Destination series. What is get from reading their reviews is plain contradiction &#x96; I think the moment they realized it was a shaky camera, they judged every other element superficially. The plot is simple Three student filmmakers begin making a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch, and this leads them to the forest where the witch is believed to have existed. Things turn sour when they find stuff in the forest they aren't supposed to, which is ironic since these stuffs would've made their documentary even more credible. They realize that the Blair Witch is simply not a myth of the ignoramus past, and that this force would always work in a similar fashion haunt at night, leave an after effect in the morning. They also have to maintain their sanity even when tensions and tempers are high. Shaky camera is probably the best aspect of Blair Witch Project. How close we are to the action, how much we anticipate like the actors about what's to happen, how much we are involved in the film because of this wonderful camera technique; it is something only a person who is ready to adjust to any film would understand. Remember Meryl Streep's line at the Oscars 'When they called my name I had this feeling I could hear half of America going, oh, no!', the same thing may apply to certain audience members when they sensed the shaky camera 'When they saw shaky camera, half of the audience members went 'Oh no!'. You have to look beyond that.The camera work is crisp, highly engaging and very ingenious, even though the actors themselves didn't realize some of the best shot scenes by them were accidental. I never imagined Donahue's last message to her parents was an accidental stroke of greatness till I saw the director's commentary Heather had thought the camera was recording her entire face while she shot the sequence. Also the interesting shot of Michael in one the bottom left corner of the screen while the rest of the frame is taken up by the tall, foreboding trees was accidental. Even the perfectly coordinated shot of Michael walking away at a distance while Donahue is talking to Joshua in front. Everything is raw, raging and unconventional.Interviews with local townspeople are also very engaging, since some of the members were non-actors Advice &#x96; don't miss the director's commentary if you have the DVD; you may find new love for the movie. Another advice do not sleep during those things, considering them on trivial importance. Coming to the three main stars, Donahue is certainly the best, channeling so many emotions in the course of the film effortlessly. The scenes where she breaks down are absolutely powerful. Great support from the two guys, and again, you'll get to see 'Michael's Great Moment No 1,2&#x85;' in the director's commentary. The DVD version does go for an overkill with the made for TV feature that seems silly and excessive &#x96; it reminded me of a silly animated movie we had made for a competition where we included dozens of additional attractions, including fake reviews for the film within the film.

The main plot point, about a boy being dumped by his girlfriend, who then begins dating a minor celebrity who happens to be a douche bag, had interestingly enough been a subplot in another high school comedy released two years earlier She's All That (1999).Even more interestingly, this movie's screenwriter, R. Lee Fleming, Jr., actually wrote the screenplay to She's All That. Although he doesn't have to worry about being sued for copyright infringement, it really shows laziness on his part that Get Over It doesn't do more to add originality to a hackneyed story involving young, unrequited love.In all fairness, though, Fleming actually wrote the screenplay to Get Over It before She's All That according to interviews. Still, there are other elements of this movie that feel mercilessly ripped from other teen comedies.Most notably, the love story within this movie loosely follows the non-supernatural plot line to William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which, not coincidentally, happens to be the play in which the movie's characters participate. A little too reminiscent of 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), wouldn't you say? Recycled teen movie trends aside, a movie called Get Over It should effectively make the audience feel for the protagonist who has just been dumped. The said protagonist is Berke Landers (Ben Foster), whose longtime girlfriend Alison (Melissa Sagemiller) breaks off their 16 month relationship.It's not because she's a bad person, or because she's fallen for someone else. She clearly explains that she just doesn't feel the same way about Berke anymore.Of course, breaking up is hard to do, and it hurts no matter what age you are. However, it's difficult to feel bad for Berke for these reasons.First, all you see of Berke and Alison's previous relationship is a montage of them making out. Sure, Melissa Sagemiller is pretty, but the film needed more vivid scenes reflecting the anecdotal happiness of their relationship.Second, other than Ben Foster's sulking expression, you get no indication from his acting how much this breakup really hurts him, or why and how he misses Alison. As good an actor as Foster is in movies like Liberty Heights (1999) and 310 To Yuma (2007), he's not convincing enough here to play heartbroken. His expression is morose, but that's about it.Third, while Sagemiller seems to be (and play) a nice person, you don't get what it is about her that sets her apart from other girls, especially the many hot ones that exist in this movie (including then-unknown Zoe Saldana and Mila Kunis, who have supporting roles). Berke doesn't seem to explain that fact at any point in the movie, either, and it hurts his case.Finally, in the film's opening credits, you see Berke, departing Alison's house after she lay down the bad news, being followed by Vitamin C and an accompanying band as they lip synch Captain & Tennille's classic Love Will Keep Us Together. Vitamin C mouths the song very well, but would feel less out-of-place in that scene if she were actually mocking Berke on his walk of shame.So Berke tries out for the spring play, a musical version of A Midsummer Night's Dream, specifically to spite Alison and Bentley (Shane West). Bentley is her jerk of a rebound boyfriend who is a former boy band member with a very phony British accent. When Kelly Woods (Kirsten Dunst), a cheerful, magnetic girl who happens to be the sister of Berke's best friend Felix (Colin Hanks), offers to help Berke with his lines, you pretty much know how the story is going to go.Kirsten Dunst gets top billing in this movie despite having fewer lines and scenes than Ben Foster, but she totally deserves it. She's a welcome presence on screen, and the only downside to her character is that you fall in love with her instantly, thereby making you wonder why Berke doesn't do the same sooner.Interestingly enough, Sisqo gets third billing after Dunst and Foster. Despite an energetic ending sequence where he and Vitamin C sing a rendition of Earth, Wind, & Fire's September, Sisqo has a thankless role as the Token Black Guy. On the other hand, it's better to remember Sisqo from this movie than for his only hit, the atrocious The Thong Song.While Foster is on emotional autopilot along with the love story, Dunst actively makes the best of her role. One of her best scenes is when she sings Dream Of Me, a touching song her character wrote and included in the play against the wishes of Dr. Desmond Forrest Oates (Martin Short), the production's narcissistic director. Dunst is one of the few actresses and singers to make that song more heartbreaking and less cheesy, and she sells it.Get Over It has its good moments, and the climactic final showing of A Midsummer Night's Dream lives up to more than the entire film ultimately does. It just could have been so much more if it had tried to differentiate itself plot-wise with She's All That and other teen films. As it is, it's worth at least bag of chips, but not much more that that.

It can be the way you dress, the music you listen to, or even for teachers the way you speak to the students or the way you may put your hand on the students' shoulders.This film is perfect and so British indeed. It touches the right points and it plucks the right strings. How can a 16 year old young man, or boy if you prefer, come out of the closet and just trust himself, trust his family, trust his school, trust the world even, and know he will be accepted the way he is and the way he feels happy? That's the worst part of it. Of course the parents know there is something bothering the boy, or the young man if you prefer. Of course the teachers feel it too and even know it. The other students just feel it, decide that it is what they feel it is, and most of them, at least most of those who will say anything, will condemn the young man, or the boy if you prefer. And don't even imagine it is not the same thing for girls, or young women if you prefer.But at the same time the only way to get out of the closet is to open the door with a bang and to let everyone know that from now on they better not walk on the boy's, or the young man's if you prefer, prick and even raise one single finger to block the way, otherwise their cubes as they say in CSI will be mashed to a pulp. It takes crazy courage for the first one. It takes courage for the one hundred next ones and when you reach one thousand you can finally start finding it nearly natural. But it will be natural only when you reach the million of out-of-the-closet-tall-walkers. And tall you need to walk.I regret that this simple question of the freedom to love who you want to love and who wants to love you back, no matter who that one is has become a religious question, a political question, a philosophical question, or whatever other label you can put on that. It is none of these and it is no other classification you may invent. It is only a question of sentiments, feelings, emotions, passions, empathy and liberty. It is a basic human right. Everyone has the right to love everyone else who accepts that love and loves them back.I have been dealing with men, or women, in the closet, no matter what closet it may be, all my life. Some of my university professor colleagues told me I was not supposed to know who is Jewish, who is Moslem, who is LGBT, or whatever, and that the students are not supposed to tell. Some professors are still living on the don't ask don't tell syndrome, you know that cowardly compromise Bill Clinton invented to make everyone forget what was happening at the time in the Oval Office.And now this DADT shameful legislation has been dropped all the fundamentalist brains in the world consider marriage is for sex and sex is for procreation, and that there is no other dimension in sex and in marriage. As you can see love has disappeared for these brains that are indeed no brains. You make love but you do not love. For them everyone on this planet, and sooner or later they are going to extend this silly ideology to the moon or to mars, has to wear the only penguin costume that is allowed by the necessity to make spermatozoa and eggs meet and fertilize each other. If you use a French letter, not to say a condom, a pill of any sort, a diaphragm or, horrible horror of horrors, vanity of vanities, an abortion you become a killer, a murderer, an assassin, some one who should be stoned on market day on the market square in every village or neighbourhood in the world.Yeah it is nothing but love and love is a passion, an emotion, a feeling, a sentiment, something that makes your mind rev up and then take off at cosmic speed and in that phenomenal power and force there might be for some a sexual dimension but there is no obligation for that dimension to exist and be experienced by all the people who are in love, who love one another.

It was a runaway sensation which spawned hundreds of imitators and continues to even now. Whenever a movie is financially successful, you can bet on it studios are going to demand a sequel. Halloween II followed the original in 1981 without Carpenter's direction. It picked up exactly where the first one left off. An attempt to take the Halloween franchise into a different direction without the help of serial killer Michael Myers chopping away at victims failed in a third movie. The decision was made to re-instate the successful formula of the first two films with the next installment, Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers. Anchor Bay released a new Blu-ray version of the 1988 movie and it looks marvelous. It's the 10th anniversary of the Halloween night massacre in Haddonfield, Illinois. Michael Myers escapes from an ambulance while being transferred to another mental facility. He makes his way to the small town obsessed with finding and killing his nine-year-old niece. Dr. Loomis is hot on his bloody trail and must protect the girl and her new family from the knife-wielding maniac. Halloween IV The Return of Michael Myers is a competent follow-up to the second film. It contains everything fans of the original could want with the exception of Jamie Lee Curtis. The movie takes viewers back to the familiar location of Haddonfield 10 years later. It shows us how the town has dealt with the many deaths of their family members a decade before. There's also a direct tie to the first two films because the character of Jamie is the daughter of Laurie Strode. We see the return of Dr. Loomis and gain some insight into what happened to him after the hospital fire in Halloween II. It's interesting to note that there are very few actual scenes of stabbing or hacking. Director Dwight H. Little chose to go for a less- is-more approach and cuts away from direct scenes of penetrating carnage. It gives the film a bit of a Hitchcockian atmosphere. You can tell Little wanted to focus more on the suspense and less on the graphic violence. However, there's still plenty of blood and gore to thrill horror enthusiasts. Actor Danielle Harris is perfect as the character of Michael Myers' nine-year-old niece, Jamie. She moves back and forth through emotions quite effectively and is convincing in the role. Donald Pleasance pours his heart and soul into his portrayal of Dr. Loomis for a third time. It's excellent to see a veteran actor of his caliber take a part in what most would call a simple slasher film and treat it with such a high level of sincerity. The high-definition transfer looks and sounds excellent. The picture maintains its original feel but is clear and precise at the same time. The audio delivers all the slashing, screams, and pulsating music your nerves can take thanks to a 5.1 surround mix. Special features for this edition include two separate audio commentaries with actors Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris and director Dwight H. Little and author Justin Beahm. The 'Halloween 4 \/ 5' Discussion Panel from the 25th Anniversary celebration is also here. It contains a theatrical trailer as well. Fans of the franchise who are always looking for the latest and greatest versions of these films will want to run out and buy the new Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers Blu-ray from Anchor Bay. Consumers will also be happy with its slightly altered but new packaging.

He gets to see a couple of clips of it, but the cost of it is that a train of events is initiated leading to a deadly war between mutant (and mad) humans and the apes spurred on by impatient gorillas. Except that the Battle with everyone shouting Kill and Guns is more akin to a tightly packed affray from a Monty Python film or a Monogram mob scene. A key part is the attempted murder and the subsequent death of Caesar's son &#x96; this is poignantly portrayed for 10 minutes but is utterly jettisoned giving the outrageous impression the attention span of chimpanzees must be minimal! The entire film would probably have made a convincing episode from the TV series this incredibly spawned just afterwards, as it is it's almost unbearably drawn out. Maybe a more coherent timeline would have helped those of us ordinary people who had made it this far &#x96; as it stands the convoluted chronology is only comprehensible to dedicated geeks.

Maybe it wouldn't be as bad as when I first watched the film in theater back in 2001, and yes I stupidly paid to see this in the theater. It had been over 10 years since I've seen this movie. Who know my opinion of the film might have changed, but after watching it again it hasn't. It's just a terrible movie. This will be one of my shorter reviews and there I think will be some spoilers, but I don't care since this is just a terrible film.The story revolves around a group of bank robbers (Kurt Russell, Kevin Costner, Christian Slater, David Arquette and Bokeem Woodbine) dress up as Elvis's and rob a Las Vegas Casino. Things go wrong when Woodbine (Franklin) is shot by police and security. The four remaining robbers escape by helicopter with the help of Jack (Howie Long). The four head back to their run down motel outside Vegas to sort their shares, but Murphy (Costner) as other plans as he shots and kills Gus (Arquette), Hanson (Slater) and believes he's also killed Michael (Russell) who was wearing a vest. From there on it's a race to get the money as Cybil Waingrow (Courteney Cox) and her son get mixed up with it along with two US Marshal's (Thomas Haden Church, Kevin Pollak).The bad story was bad enough, but adding in uninteresting and uninteresting characters and you've got a terrible film. Russel's character was supposed to play the good guy as he had a conscience, but that doesn't take away that his character is about as interesting and likable as a rock you have to stare at four hours kind of like this film. Costner playing the bad guy seemed not to want to be in this awful film. He probably was wondering when his career took a downward turn. It was just a few years ago he was starring in films like A PERFECT WORLD, ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES, JFK and THE BODY GUARD. I think his career took a turn with WATERWORLD and THE POSTMAN. Waterworld wasn't good, but it's not as bad as people make it out to be, especially if you watch the extended edition. The Postman in my opinion is a good film, but not great. Still neither were box office hits and his career started to go downward until he relegated to star in crappy heist films like this one. The most interesting and fun characters are the the supporting characters. Howie Long the ex-NFL player turned analysis and actor was having a fun time with this film as he had no pressure on him. Also Thomas Haden Church and Kevin Pollak seemed to have good chemistry as partners and to be honest I was rooting for them to kill all the bank robbers including Russel's character.You'd expect the action to be good in a heist film. Now I wasn't expecting great action like HEAT that was just a special film, but I was expecting to be entertained. I wasn't and outside of the beginning action scene in the casino which was decent it was all bad. Even the climax in a warehouse was a let down. There's lots of blame to go around for the lack of good action, you could blame the studio Warner Brothers for this, but I don't. I think the WB gave up on this film after they saw it, and if I remember it right there wasn't a lot of promotion for this film. You could just tell WB had no confidence in this film. No I blame the director Demian Lichtenstein who also co-wrote this piece of crap. Apparently Demian was a big music video director, but had only directed one feature film before this one called Lowball, and I had to look it up to find out that it was a direct to VHS film. Maybe I should blame WB for hiring this guy to write and direct a feature film, because he's terrible.Overall 3000 Miles to Graceland is a terrible film and as bad a I remember it.

Usually movies are bound by their basic settings. If the movie starts with certain characters and tones, chances are that those basic building blocks will not change all that much throughout the course of the movie. Which is why I love adventure films so much as they're usually full of exotic locations, ever-changing situations and there's always something new to marvel at.The same principle applies here. The seven wishes granted to Elliot (Brendan Fraser) allow him to go through many different scenarios and locations, from Columbia to the 19th century America. The problem is that some of these scenarios brought by the wishes are not that creative and usually depend on a singular joke to be made. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. The first few wishes and the various problems that occur are pretty funny to follow and I found myself chuckling from time to time, but the novelty wears off pretty quickly. The scenarios don't repeat themselves that much, but when you know that Elliot still has wishes left to be used, you can pretty much expect that something will go wrong with the first six, which kills the excitement. All that is left is the wonderment of how the Devil (Elizabeth Hurley) will screw up this particular wish for Elliot. Though admittedly the last few wishes manage to dust off the formula to a certain degree, but I still feel that the writers could have been a bit more creative. Of course this is a remake, but they already changed some things, like the gender of the Devil, so why not go a bit further.On the technical side of things, the three main actors (Fraser, Hurley and O'Connor) play their roles pretty convincingly and I enjoyed their performances. They weren't anything spectacular, but the comedic timing was there and I especially enjoyed Hurley's portrayal of the Devil as a vindictive, petty and mean-spirited, yet surprisingly sympathetic character. She was evil, sure, but the malice just wasn't there. It's her job to be evil, so she is. Strange take on the classic character, but for the purposes of the film, it actually worked quite well.Final thoughts I cannot really find it in me to call this movie bad, though the rating I'll give it is quite low, mainly because it's just so cheesy and doesn't really explore its possibilities. It's still enjoyable if all you're looking for are some cheap laughs and a way to spend an hour and a half.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"24 August 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Close to the brink of America's involvement in the II World War the Trask family living in a small community in Salinas Valley attempts to revolutionize transport of fresh food with the use of ice wagons. Deeply religious and well-meaning Adam Trask (Raymond Massey) brought up his two sons by himself, having told them that their mother died long ago. Aron (Richard Davalos) is the perfect child, helpful, considerate and much akin to his father. His opposite is Cal (James Dean), treated very much as an 'evil seed', a troublemaker and almost an outcast within this small family of three. Change enters into the life of the Trasks, when Cal unwittingly uncovers that his mother is in fact still alive and operates a bordello in the neighbouring town.Elia Kazan's East of Eden, based on the brilliant novel by John Steinbeck, enters the XXI Century in a digitally improved version with vibrant colors and outstanding shots stemming from a weird phase in American film history. Nonetheless the ultimate pitfall stems from the impossibility to modernize the acting or storytelling enacting present in this revered oldie.One of only a handful of films featuring the legendary James Dean, East of Eden was bound to develop an undying fanbase, hellbent on admiring the picture despite the problematic ageing of the movie itself. Dean himself comes across as a tremendous actor, a true volcanoe of talent, screen presence and charm, but even more apparent is that his is an uncut rough diamond yet to be fully utilized in a masterpiece. Nonetheless the acting methods employed by Kazan now seem horribly out of touch, while Julie Harris (playing Aron's fiancée) comes of wooden with a forcibly fake overacting. The contrast to the naturally rebellious Dean just enhances the weaknesses of the remaining cast.The backbone of the movie is a family friendly rewrite of Steinbeck's novel with such ridiculous underpinnings as the absurd attempt to avoid explicitly talking about bordellos, instead referring to them as 'those houses'. Albeit justifiable given the religious upbringing of the Trask family, it does dilute certain key oppositions presented in the novel. 50+ years on the lightly treading presentation reeks with taking the easy 'Hollywood' road, so despite strong symbolic undertones the movie does seem awash of real depth, instead just offering a light dramatic punch for easy viewing. Given the high tempo narrative to which the newer generations are being accustomed to East of Eden does seem to unnecessarily drag, especially in between scenes not featuring James Dean. Well placed on the shoulders of an excellent story and James Dean rough, but forceful performance, East of Eden does stand the test of time to a limited extent, now coming off overly melodramatic, self-consciously cautious and slightly heavyhanded with it treatment of the story's potential. Surprisingly in a movie focused on recovering the past the characters have none with little time really offered to discovering dark family secrets, instead tough subjects are glossed over with empty statements. That said the expectance to entail the multitude of threads in Steinbeck's novel may just have been beyond filming. Nonetheless East of Eden so diluted by the script seems overly hollow and fails to attack the real gist of the book.
