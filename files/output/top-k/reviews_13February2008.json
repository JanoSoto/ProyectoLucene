If you've seen films like JAWS or DELIVERANCE, the premise of ANACONDA is nothing new We've all seen this set up before, a group of people thrust out from civilization, and completely out of experience and supplies, the jungle gets pretty rough on them. To add up to the challenge, circumstance throws in a bloodthirsty creature who happens to be hungry for anything, even if its Jennifer Lopez in need of a paycheck. But while it could have been at least a decent guilty pleasure, ANACONDA is just another monster movie with the seen that, done that, now here's just more of it feeling. Still, now matter how much this film was predictable and passé, I am happy to credit one of the best things about hate film, which is actually more creepier than any snake in the film. This is Jon Voight's character called Serone. He's the bad guy who's sole purpose is too simply learn his lesson the hard way. It's no spoiler he's the bad guy, with his squint-eyed looks, you know this guy's up to no good. Sure he camps it all up, but at least he's more lively than any of the other cast members, which happen to include big names like J-Lo, Ice Cube, Jonathan Hyde and Owen Wilson, who serve very little purpose but snake chow. Although it is pretty decent as a creature flick, with a few scenes of suspense (not to mention Serone), but the payoff is just a cheap, campy monster flick revamped with a bigger budget but still with B-grade quality of story and characters. The special effects don't help much either. While the animatronic Anaconda is OK, the CGI ones are just bad. Even the CGI in JUMANJI was more convincing. Despite a few occasionally seat-gripping moments, there are no real scares or suspense whatsoever. ANACONDA is not a terrible film, but it is still not a very good one, or at least a good one at that. Either I'm bored with it, or its bored with itself. Which ever, you'll still find a better show when you look up anacondas on a book. At least you'll know how to close it and end it.Rating *1\/2 out of 5.

Not by any stretch of the imagination. I've only watched one of his films(Signs), but what I hear about the others doesn't particularly help my view. But I must admit, this film did keep my interest throughout. The version I watched had been edited for content, and was about an hour and a half, not the two hours or so that IMDb lists. My interest in this stems solely from my being a long-time fan of comic books, and the media of them. That was the only reason I gave this a chance. I am not disappointed. Be aware that you shouldn't expect a comic book film... or an action piece based on comics. This is still M. Night, and from what I understand, his work is about the build-up, the atmosphere, and the twist in the end. On that, I can't help but be impressed, in fact by all three. The film has something of an undertone of comic books, without ever losing seriousness, as so often happens when the silver screen has such projected onto it. M. achieves that masterfully. Lighting, cinematography, editing, all top-notch. The acting hardly possesses any flaws. The writing is solid, though a few scenes and lines came off silly. The ambiguity and depth herein is commendable. The humor is a fitting dry wit. The film is disturbing at times. The references to both comics and comic book films are great. The twist, I found to be breathtaking. I won't claim that I got everything about this movie, but I was definitely intrigued. Pacing is deliberate.

And let me just say right off the bat, that Brad Anderson is a genius. Horror movies nowadays suck to the Nth degree, they are not scary to begin with. Also, horror films nowadays are filled with lazy scripts that consist of tired remakes and ripoff's of better movies. I applaud filmmakers like Brad who decide to do something new, creative and beautiful at the same time and don't just solely reside on copying other people's films just to get a few bucks. After seeing Brad Anderson's superb The Machinist, I didn't knew he had made another horror\/thriller film beforehand. Much to my surprise, they had a previewed copy in Blockbuster, and I bought it without thinking it twice. You see, there are different types of Horror. There's the supernatural horror, with howling spirits, Satan and his cronies and men under white sheets. The monster Horror movie which basically consists of, well, you guessed it Monsters! And then there's my favorite The Psychological Horror. This is my favorite simply because it is the more effective. Entering the mind of a sadistic serial killer is more eerie and creepy than any movie with vampires or ghouls and goblins. Yes, sometimes you can combine them producing great results (Exorcist, Changeling, Herzog's Nosferatu among others), but they don't always prove a success.Session 9 is basically a whodunit, but done much more interestingly and creepy. An asbestos crew is hired to do a clean up in an old, dusty and exhaustively big abandoned insane asylum. They have about a week to tidy the place up so they can get a 10,000 dollar bonus. What happens between those days, is truly the stuff nightmares are made of. A decent cast is summoned here. David Caruso serves us a good performance and his now infamous line F*ck youuu really cracked me up, but apart from that, he was good. The fantastic Peter Mullen has obviously the best performance, a really great characterization of a calm, lonely and ultimately ____ man. Josh Lucas did a surprise performance, and Stephen Gevedon was also very effective. However, I found Brendan Sexton's acting truly atrocious. Even though the character he portrays is basically a dumbass, he just didn't render him good enough and he delivered his lines like an unexperienced child-actor would; he was really one of the things that I hated about this movie. The sound effects in this one are very good; they constantly reminded of a video game called Silent Hill, especially it's sequel, Silent Hill 2; truly marvelous games that were destroyed by a pisspoor movie adaption. And the wheelchair scene in this film and also on The Changeling, which I guess was this film's inspiration, actually makes an appearance in Silent Hill 3, just to show that the Japanese sometimes gets their ideas from Americans. Some things bothered me in this one, like a certain scene with a naked somebody or some poor camera work, and Sexton, goddamn him.The Bottom Line A truly smart horror film, with a superb script, acting (except Sexton of course), music, ambiance, mostly everything really. Brandon definitely perfected his craft with The Machinist, but this movie could've been something more if it had more refining and more cash to work with. But what we get is something very original and great. An 8\/10, one of the best horror movies of the 21 century.

What happens between those days, is truly the stuff nightmares are made of. A decent cast is summoned here. David Caruso serves us a good performance and his now infamous line F*ck youuu really cracked me up, but apart from that, he was good. The fantastic Peter Mullen has obviously the best performance, a really great characterization of a calm, lonely and ultimately ____ man. Josh Lucas did a surprise performance, and Stephen Gevedon was also very effective. However, I found Brendan Sexton's acting truly atrocious. Even though the character he portrays is basically a dumbass, he just didn't render him good enough and he delivered his lines like an unexperienced child-actor would; he was really one of the things that I hated about this movie. The sound effects in this one are very good; they constantly reminded of a video game called Silent Hill, especially it's sequel, Silent Hill 2; truly marvelous games that were destroyed by a pisspoor movie adaption. And the wheelchair scene in this film and also on The Changeling, which I guess was this film's inspiration, actually makes an appearance in Silent Hill 3, just to show that the Japanese sometimes gets their ideas from Americans. Some things bothered me in this one, like a certain scene with a naked somebody or some poor camera work, and Sexton, goddamn him.The Bottom Line A truly smart horror film, with a superb script, acting (except Sexton of course), music, ambiance, mostly everything really. Brandon definitely perfected his craft with The Machinist, but this movie could've been something more if it had more refining and more cash to work with. But what we get is something very original and great. An 8\/10, one of the best horror movies of the 21 century.

Lecter hints that he knows who Bill is and Clarice tries to find out...but Lecter is playing serious mind games with her. I caught this back in 1991. I liked it but I thought Foster was just OK and I found the story pretty confusing with glaring lapses in logic. Seeing it now some 17 years later I still feel the same way. The film is somewhat slow and I wasn't that scared or upset by it. Also Foster (who's Southern accent comes and goes at an alarming rate) is just OK. I'm really surprised that she won the Oscar for this. PLOT SPOILER AHEAD!!!! There was also a lot of gay groups who complained that Buffalo Bill was a transsexual. As a gay guy I wasn't offended but other people were just horrified. END SPOILER!!! Still the movie isn't a total washout. Hopkins is just superb as Lecter. He's downright terrifying at times. He's only on screen about a total of 30 minutes but you always feel his presence. Also his breakout (while completely illogical) is one of the scariest sequences I've ever seen. The whole movie is well-directed especially during the final sequence. Also it's the first horror film since 1932 to win an acting Academy Award. Heck, it won quite a few! Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Hopkins), Best Actress (Foster), Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. So, it's a very good thriller worth catching...but Academy Award material?

To me, 'E.T.' is a nice little fairy tale with some cute moments, a two and one-half star film. But 'Poltergeist' is perhaps THE great modern horror flick, a trendsetting movie and one of those which pays homage to to its predecessors while raising the bar for all that follow. I won't get into the who-really-directed 'Poltergeist' argument, Tobe Hooper or Steven Spielberg, other than to say it has Spielberg written all over it. This time, that's a good thing, as the material plays to his strengths and minimizes his weaknesses. He loves telling stories that revolve around a family, which 'Poltergeist' certainly does, and his childhood love of horror flicks stands him in good stead to deliver the scares several times during the warm-hearted yet spooky adventure. Casting of the actors was certainly a key factor in the film's success. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams were hardly household names at the time, but the two of them have never been better, as Steven and Diane Freeling. Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robins, and especially Heather O'Rourke each provide exceptional performances as their kids in the film. O'Rourke is a natural child star, adorable beyond words but just as importantly, absolutely believable. There are several ways 'Poltergeist' could have gone terribly wrong. Spielberg manages to rein in his cutesy side just enough; it's still there, but in tolerable doses. It must have been tempting to simply make the ghosts mischievous and funny. Fortunately, one of them isn't, and there is a very real aura of menace and fright as well as concern for what might happen to Carol Anne (O'Rourke). Likewise, the spiritual medium brought in at the end, Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubinstein) has her share of funny lines but thankfully isn't played just for laughs. Even though it's a horror movie, 'Poltergeist' is one of those films you wish you were in. The Freelings are such a likable family that you think, I wish that was my family. Sequels followed (the second 'Poltergeist' is a very decent and scary film) but inevitably they ran out of steam and ideas.

O'Brien's songs are exactly the sort of high-energy, get-down music that is needed to pull off this wildly imaginative spoof of horror\/sci-fi\/crime film.It's a hoot to see future Oscar winner Susan Sarandon as an uptight, recently engaged, virginal Janet (with pink dress, of course), having a night with her fiancé, the equally uptight Brad, that neither of them could ever have imagined.Every now and then, a poll is taken to list the best film performances of all time. This one has never made the list, but for my money, one of the top ten performances in the history of film belongs to the Sweet Transvestite himself, Tim Curry. He inhabits the role with such verve and engaging weirdness that you WANT him to win out, even though you know that (among other things) he's a murderer and a cannibal. You even try to tell yourself that hey, what he did wasn't THAT bad.In every scene, the eye is drawn inexorably to Curry (no mean feat, with Sarandon as costar). Everything he does, whether drooling over his latest creation, using an electric knife to slice a turkey, or merely raising an eyebrow, is magnetic; it's impossible to look away. He's funny, he's frightening, he's amazingly sexy, and his performance is sheer genius.

When Benjamin Caine (Rob Lowe), a TV executive, buy the show Wayne and Garth must deal with the differences between their little show where they can do everything and their new big show where they are exploited.The script of this film was based upon the characters created by Mike Myers for the show Saturday Night Live and for me the characters of Wayne and Garth are nothing but memorable just like all the original scenes of the film like the sponsor's commercials, the scenes with the camera following the characters, the scene with Jimi Hendrix's song Foxy Lady and the different endings including a great spoof of Scooby-Doo.The cast is really funny with Mike Myers in one of his first films and still one of his most memorable works. Dana Carvey is just the perfect partner of Myers and is really funny too. The cast also include the lovely Tia Carrere as Cassandra, her most known role and the cameo of Alice Cooper as himself, according to the film, a very boring rock star.And as i said the music of the film is terrific, including songs of great bands like Queen (Bohemian Rhapsody), The Jimi Hendrix Experience (Fire and Foxy Lady), Soundgarden (Loud Love), Red Hot Chili Peppers (Sikamikanico), Temple of the Dog (All Night Thing) and some other great songs.Conclusion this is an excellent comedy with two great characters and with a very original style, always with rock music in the heart. 9 out of 10DVD i recently get this DVD in a very low price and is excellent too.

Rather than trust John Law to sort things out, he runs off to find the story behind the belt, taking with him Erica (Nova Pilbeam), the young and innocent daughter of the village police chief.If The 39 Steps is about the man running away, Young And Innocent a.k.a. The Girl Was Young, is about the woman helping him. Young Pilbeam (as of this writing the earliest Hitchcock heroine still alive) radiates unusual low-key beguilement for a Hitch blonde with her strong Martha Plimpton cheekbones, trim build, and fetching eyes. Unlike Madeleine Carroll in The 39 Steps, she's never not on Tisdall's side in some way, and the suspense of Young And Innocent is less for that. But she keeps you watching her.Poor De Marney is more like a stick of wood, though, reminding me of a grown-up Freddie Bartholomew and not surprisingly called a boy a few times. He distractingly treats the whole ordeal as something of a lark.I can laugh because I'm innocent, he tells Erica. You don't believe me. I wish you did. Eventually, of course, she does. There's a fun scene at a children's party the two fugitives are trying to escape, where Basil Radford in a wimple offers unlikely aid. J.H. Roberts' defense attorney gets his client off despite his ineffectuality - easily the funniest incompetent solicitor until Henry Winkler's in Arrested Development. Hitch's cameo here is rather more fun than most - it's one of his longer bits, and involves some animated expressions.Hitchcock finds the funny and sets a steady pace, but allows a dodgy story to get away from him more than usual, averaging one contrivance every five minutes. The anti-cop animus is heavier than usual, for example when he sticks a pair of friendly constables in a pig truck. He even allows Erica's dog Towser to disappear mid-scene without explanation. The Scottie Vanishes! The finale is the one trick Hitch pulls out of his hat, an utterly masterful one, probably working even better today because of its in-your-face South Parkean political incorrectness. Not going to ruin it, just bemoan the fact that after the big reveal, the resolution itself is another one of Y&I's underdone moments.But this is a good opportunity to observe Hitchcock's early mastery of the setpiece, and his mingling of suspense and comedy. Just don't ponder the holes too much - Hitch sure didn't!

","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Romance"},{"date":"13 February 2008","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" This early talkie from Alfred Hitchcock would stand a little taller in his catalog had it not come two years after his greatest wrong-man chase story, The 39 Steps.This time the wrong man is Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney), in trouble when a female acquaintance washes up on a quaint English beach while he is walking by - along with a coat belt which choked the life from her and apparently belonged to him. Rather than trust John Law to sort things out, he runs off to find the story behind the belt, taking with him Erica (Nova Pilbeam), the young and innocent daughter of the village police chief.If The 39 Steps is about the man running away, Young And Innocent a.k.a. The Girl Was Young, is about the woman helping him. Young Pilbeam (as of this writing the earliest Hitchcock heroine still alive) radiates unusual low-key beguilement for a Hitch blonde with her strong Martha Plimpton cheekbones, trim build, and fetching eyes. Unlike Madeleine Carroll in The 39 Steps, she's never not on Tisdall's side in some way, and the suspense of Young And Innocent is less for that. But she keeps you watching her.Poor De Marney is more like a stick of wood, though, reminding me of a grown-up Freddie Bartholomew and not surprisingly called a boy a few times. He distractingly treats the whole ordeal as something of a lark.I can laugh because I'm innocent, he tells Erica. You don't believe me. I wish you did. Eventually, of course, she does. There's a fun scene at a children's party the two fugitives are trying to escape, where Basil Radford in a wimple offers unlikely aid. J.H. Roberts' defense attorney gets his client off despite his ineffectuality - easily the funniest incompetent solicitor until Henry Winkler's in Arrested Development. Hitch's cameo here is rather more fun than most - it's one of his longer bits, and involves some animated expressions.Hitchcock finds the funny and sets a steady pace, but allows a dodgy story to get away from him more than usual, averaging one contrivance every five minutes. The anti-cop animus is heavier than usual, for example when he sticks a pair of friendly constables in a pig truck. He even allows Erica's dog Towser to disappear mid-scene without explanation. The Scottie Vanishes! The finale is the one trick Hitch pulls out of his hat, an utterly masterful one, probably working even better today because of its in-your-face South Parkean political incorrectness. Not going to ruin it, just bemoan the fact that after the big reveal, the resolution itself is another one of Y&I's underdone moments.But this is a good opportunity to observe Hitchcock's early mastery of the setpiece, and his mingling of suspense and comedy.

Lock... is a bit different movie, cause Ritchie introduces us with the way he's making movies and the whole atmosphere of London he wants to present. While Lock... has more 'domestic' look, Snatch has more well-known actors (bigger budget) and also a story that doesn't get behind Ritchie's first movie. My personal favorite is Snatch, although I gave maximum grades to both movies.Ritchie's constellation of characters is simply great. Here, the story follows Turkish (Jason Statham), an unlicensed boxing promoter, and his friend and colleague Tommy (Stephen Graham). They are involved into the world of match fixing by the notorious Brick Top (Alan Ford). Things get complicated when the boxer they had gets beaten by Mickey (Brad Pitt). Tommy is guilty for that, cause he wanted to buy a caravan from the Irish Gypsies (Mickey and his 'family') and things get pretty wrong. Now Turkish and Tommy tries to convince Mickey to fight for them and eventually lose. At the same time, a huge diamond is stolen, so that involves lots of strange characters, like 'Cousin Avi' (Dennis Farina), Boris 'The Blade' (Rade Serbedzija), Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro), Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) and lots more, who all want diamond (on one way or another) for themselves.We've got bunch of crazy characters, excellent story and brilliant direction that makes this movie interesting and not for a second boring. My favorite character is Boris 'The Blade', played by Serbedzija. Maybe I'm not very objective, cause I'm Croatian just like Rade but he really had amazing character and he acted perfectly. But the best performance comes from Brad Pitt. He is memorable as Mickey and this is definitely one his best roles in career. Of course I bow to everyone else, especially Ford (brilliant), Statham, Jones, Farina, Del Toro and those three 'bookie robbers' Robbie Gee, Lennie James and Ade. They afford me laugh that is hard to forget. Thank you all. All that I can say is that I want more, more of this sort of characters and more of this kind of bizarre situations. And of course more of Ritchie's humor that blown me off the first time; and now once again.

The prof teaches a class on terrorism, especially homegrown cases, such as Ruby Ridge. At this time, Grant is struggling over the death of his mother and the fact that his father has a new girlfriend, Brooke (Hope Davis). One day, Michael comes across a boy stumbling down his street, badly hurt and bleeding. Not hesitating a moment, he loads the boy into his car and rushes him to the nearest hospital's emergency room. The boy survives. All at once, the boy's parents, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack) rush into the medical center and learn about the near calamity. It seems their son was playing with fireworks and accidentally injured himself. What is more startling is that the Langs are the Faradays new neighbors. The two families begin a relationship, with Oliver suggesting that Grant might benefit by joining a scouting group in the area. It works, Grant seems better. But, even though the Langs appear to be the All-American Family, things begin to unsettle Michael. When Mike locks himself out of the house, he tries to use the Lang's telephone but the children, home alone, are most reluctant to let him in the house. There is a large map hiding something in Oliver's study, too, and Mr. Lang's job, as an engineer, may be a cover for something else, also, when Michael tries to get a hold of him at work. Little things start to add up, especially since Michael learns that Oliver was in the area of the deadly terrorist attack in St. Louis the year before. Could Mr. and Mrs. All America really be, gulp, terrorists? This is a great film which takes its themes straight from today's headlines (most notably, the Oklahoma City bombing) and asks the viewer to consider the hypotheticals. Would it be possible for you to have a terrorist neighbor, who appears to be an ordinary, upright citizen but who knows how to arrange acts of destruction without getting the blame? What a scary thought but, as this movie shows, it could happen. As the film's players, all of the actors here are magnificent. Bridges is terrific as the professor who thinks he knows something about terrorism but has some lessons to learn. Davis is intelligent and beautiful as his wary girlfriend and Robbins and Cusack are absolutely terrifying beyond belief as the smiling neighbors who have gigantic secrets to hide. The scenery around the nation's capital is fine, as are the costumes and production values. The script is tantalizingly wonderful and the direction has one's heart pounding away at any given moment, leading to a sensational conclusion. If you have never seen or heard of this movie, don't delay! Go up the road NOW and rent or borrow this gem. It is as exciting and relevant as a film can ever get.
