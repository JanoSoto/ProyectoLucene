While K.O.D was not as good as either of those movies, I think they definitely achieved that tone. If you've seen Fist of Legend, you can definitely see that they heavily borrowed from it's fights; and the movie sort of has the same ambience as The Professional.I have been waiting for several years now, to see an American movie that really shows more of Jet Li's ability. While he was cool in Lethal Weapon 4, it really didn't show us enough. Romeo Must Die was just a major disappointment; seemingly more focused on the rap music (and stars) than really showcasing Jet Li.Now we have K.O.D., while not perfect, is a definite positive step towards an awesome Li movie. As you watch the fights in this movie, you can really see the pain in the punches, so to speak. Corey Yuen, although a good fight coreographer, needs to work with the director on showing the action as a whole, more then in a bunch of quick-cutting closeups. I tend to notice this in a lot of his coreography (especially in his U.S. movies). It also seems he put in an ode-to-Wolverine, with the chopsticks scene (he did the coreography for X-men).Bridget Fonda was (and although I think she's okay) just wasted. She always just seems a little too nice, and she spent a good deal of the movie whining. I found myself waiting for her scenes to be over so we could move on to the next.Another element, even though it was cool, that seemed thrown in was the dojo scene. That was almost certainly taken right out of Fist of Legend, with the leg hitting techniques of Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection (which FOL was a tribute to).And when, oh when, will we ever see a modern martial arts movie without rap music. Soon I hope. This movie almost made it, but it was still scattered throughout.To sum it up, the movie had a decent plot (although full of holes) and had some good fights.  A solid 8\/10.One more thing.... when will people learn that an actors ability to fight in movies, is in NO WAY a reflection of how he fights in real life?! That's like saying that an actor really acts like the character he's protraying. Jet Li does Wushu Kung-Fu which is a really showy martial art and is heavily used in movies. I happen to know people who know close connections to Jet Li which in fact, admit that he's not that good of a fighter. In fact, they said if anyone, Jackie Chan is a better real life fighter ( and Sammo Hung is known to be a better fighter than Jackie). In terms of movies, Jet Li is up there, if not better than Bruce Lee. But out of the movies, Bruce was known for being the real thing.

Not only the way the suspense is built up but also the way it is filmed... to give just one example the scene at the beach when Roy Scheider is observing the sea.In style and esp. in the style of the music there are a few minor similarities to Hitchcock (and his main composer Bernard Herrmann).By the way The music by John Williams is very strong and adds a lot to the film!As I would rate the first half of JAWS for 9 or 10* of 10 points - but I'd give the second half of the movie probably 2* out of 10 points.Maybe I am the only one who sees it this way but I really think it gets a lot weaker in the end.The final on the small ship with the three men and the shark takes much too long in my opinion.

And the three of them did. This is a perfect combination of romance, comedy, suspense and action.You are kept guessing the entire time who is who and since the movie moves so well and is so completely entertaining, you are going to have a great time watching this.  Add three actors who would go on to win Supporting Oscars - Walter Matthau, George Kennedy and James Coburn - all of whom are very funny and menacing.  Kennedy, Coburn and Ned Glass make memorable entrances into the movie, one by one, each funnier than the last.  I am sure in 1963 this was thought of as a decent movie, no great big deal.  Seen today, next to today's computer-generated movies and movie stars, it looks even better.

With its impending DVD release, and the subsequent controversy (translates to free publicity) that is sure to follow it, 'Series 7' is going to become one of the defining films of 2001.  And what a film it is...Crafted as a modern reality television show (and including all of the pop psychology, melodrama, and editing-based cliff-hangers that these shows thrive on), 'Series 7' basically tells the story of eight-months-pregnant Dawn returning to her East Coast hometown to confront her family and her old high school sweetheart.  The residents of her hometown are not exactly delighted to see her (at least not in person!), since for months now they have all witnessed Dawn brutally murdering people on the mega-popular 'Contender' gameshow.  Five hometown residents are particularly concerned with Dawn's return, as they have been assigned by government computers to join Dawn in the 'Contender's' kill-or-be-killed gameshow.  It's survival of the fittest, where the only grand prize is life, and the only parting gift is a bullet in the head.Sounds like a laugh riot, huh!?  Easily one of the funniest films I have seen in a long time, 'Series 7' relies primarily on violence or the preparation for impending violence to elicit laughter from the audience.  And laugh they did!  I have seen only a small number of comedies at the Uptown Theatre, but none was as warmly received as 'Series 7.'  From the opening gunshot to...uh...well, to the closing gunshot, this crowd was in stitches!  So were most of the 'contenders'...Sure, people will complain that this is just American bloodlust at its worst, that somehow violence and humor should never be so directly linked, that this film will inspire violence in the real world, blah, blah, blah.  Well you know what I say to those people!?  Too bad!!  Murder can be damn funny on film and few films pull it off as well as S7.  It also works as a quality satire, critiquing both the constructed reality of television in general and the tropes of reality shows like 'Survivor' and 'Big Brother' in particular.Complaints, you ask?  Surely there must be something to criticize!  Well, every film has its flaws, and S7 is no exception.  A minor issue to be sure, but I think S7 was just a little to restrained when it comes to violence.  We could have used a few additional contestants (meaning a few additional murders) and maybe some more backstory on Dawn's earlier success on 'The Contenders.'All in all, I loved it and I can't wait for the DVD!

While Final Fantasy wasn't nearly as bad as Tomb Raider, the spiritual element made up far too much of the story for the film as a whole to be taken seriously. The religious aspect is unmistakable and almost suffocating, as Aki and Dr. Sid and the others search feverishly for the spirits that are expected to collectively eliminate all of the invading phantoms. There are many other heavily religious allusions, not the least of which is the basic good vs. evil story structure and the clearly Satanic appearance of the phantoms themselves. One of the great ironies of computer animation, that this film in particular brings to attention, is the fact that the better it gets, the less necessary it is. Sure, there are things that can be done with computer animation that would be impossible to film with real actors, but Final Fantasy looked so real that many of the scenes may as well have been real. On the other hand, humans have been particularly troublesome in computer animated films - they just never quite look right. But here, they are so real that it is unnerving, but this time, they screwed up the humans MOVEMENTS. No matter how real they looked in the movie, the actual motion was still entirely robotic. Besides that, it was a mistake to have so many well known actors lending their voices to the film, because all that did was take voices that we know and put them on other people, which was distracting because the people looked so real. This all makes you wonder when full-length animated films will become obsolete and computer animation will be used only to add to the special effects of other movies. On the other hand, Final Fantasy did have some of the most amazing scenery ever made with computer animation. The desolated New York City was amazingly real, and the idea of the humans hiding in gigantic enclosed areas to keep safe from the phantoms was also very interesting. But in the second half of the film, this all gets a little convoluted and we see the sacrifice of the human element of the movie in favor of the competition between Dr. Sid's peaceful theory and General Hein's militaristic tactics, as the two clash at the film's climax. Final Fantasy is not a complete failure, and is far superior to it's real life counterpart, the awful Tomb Raider, but there can be no mistake that it is disappointing.

He infuses his character with warmth and sincerity that makes him by far the most endearing character on film in recent memory, and in a world not gone mad, would all but guarantee him the Oscar this year.  In a surprise trick casting, we have Nicole Kidman as an ambitious whore who compensates for meager talent by her willingness to enter a sham relationship in exchange for fame and fortune.  Where does she find her inspiration?  She reaches somewhere inside and finds something to make it work, and work it does in far and away her best role since she was again surprisingly cast as a scheming conniving bitch in Malice.  They just keep coming out of the blue.There isn't a single cast member who isn't stellar, and the pace and density of the production, although at times a little trying, is an embarrassment of  riches.  Watch for John Leguizamo's touching speech about love as the unloved Toulouse Lautrec.  He should be getting much bigger and better roles, and maybe this will open some doors.Although a must own on the eventual DVD, this is also a big-screen experience that cannot be missed.

She reaches somewhere inside and finds something to make it work, and work it does in far and away her best role since she was again surprisingly cast as a scheming conniving bitch in Malice.  They just keep coming out of the blue.There isn't a single cast member who isn't stellar, and the pace and density of the production, although at times a little trying, is an embarrassment of  riches.  Watch for John Leguizamo's touching speech about love as the unloved Toulouse Lautrec.  He should be getting much bigger and better roles, and maybe this will open some doors.Although a must own on the eventual DVD, this is also a big-screen experience that cannot be missed.  It is everything a great musical should be, and everything all great musicals have been, all rolled into one.  An absolute treasure.

In the pop culture tradition of the best postmodern fiction, it is endlessly self-referential, and delightfully merges just about every cultural reference imaginable with each of their antecedents.  Madonna and Monroe are unified in a psuedo-drag number that objectifies every drag queen who ever did the same to the originals.  And oh, those songs!  From the Material Girl to the Rocket Man, and everything in between, with totally acceptable performances by all involved.  If you love good music, you'll love some of the best all over again as you see it in a context you never imagined.Ewan McGregor is absolutely enchanting as the young writer attempting to break into the Paris arts circle that inhabits the Moulin Rouge.  He infuses his character with warmth and sincerity that makes him by far the most endearing character on film in recent memory, and in a world not gone mad, would all but guarantee him the Oscar this year.

After numerous viewings -including the original viewing in the theatre - it never looses its' shine!  My favorite comedy out there by far.

I love sci-fi, video games, computer animation so this seemed like a movie that I would love.  I have to say that watching this movie was a very enjoyable experience, but it could have been better.Here are my complaints with this movie (although they are relatively minor).  First of all, the ending neither gave us a sense of closure nor made us excited about a sequel.  They killed off too many of the characters.  It wasn't really necessary to kill Grey at the end.  Speaking of Grey, he allowed Aki to control him too much.I also would have liked to seen more environments to allow for the exhibition of a wider range of animation techniques.  Titan AE did a great job in this area while Final Fantasy stayed in just a few settings.  Furthermore, this Mother of the Earth junk too closely resembles Captain Planet and that is never a good thing.As for the good in this movie, I could write forever on that but most of it is obvious.  The computer animation's realism surpasses everything before it.  I mean, they have the details down to the pores in their skin.  The action is superb, and Skywalker Sound did a fantastic job with the audio.  The flow of this movie is truly unique.  It is almost like a Virtual Reality.Conclusion one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies ever,  9 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 July 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I had been eagerly waiting for this movie for over a year.
