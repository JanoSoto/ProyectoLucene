She could star in a two hour movie that consisted entirely of her sitting in a rocking chair and reading the Wall Street Journal, and I would see it on opening day and love it.  The other factor is  2)  I love cheesy horror movies.  The cheesier, the better.On those two counts, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer shines.  It's not a great movie, not by a long shot.  I don't think anyone expects it to be a great movie.  It's not even as good as the original.  But, I don't think to many people expect a sequel to be better than the original, anyway.The movie has a stylish opening in a church confessional that provides an excellent means of re-capping the events of the first film, and provides a unique setting for a confrontation between the fisherman and Julie, the film's protagonist.When the above sequence turns out to be a dream, a clever throw-away line is spoken by a would-be admirer of Julie.  He asked Julie if she had the dream about the shower again.  And in doing so, explained away the last scene in the original as being a dream, and not merely a forgotten plot point.The rest of the scenes in Julie's college town are a fine, quick introduction to the core ensemble of the film.The movie falters somewhat once it gets to its island getaway.  It falters because of the introduction of a dearth of uninteresting, outright annoying characters.  There is a fatso-druggie character whose death I was hoping for from the very first scene he was in.  There was also a stupid red-herring character  of a vodoo practitioner.  His death, too, was a welcome one.  The list could go on and on.But that is really my only complaint about this movie.  I have to say that Jennifer Love Hewitt's scene on the tanning bed was the highlight not only of this film, but of every movie I've seen this year.  But that's just hormones talking.Mekhi Phifer was a particular stand-out in this movie.  He got most of the good lines and was the character I most identified with.Brandy, I expected to be annoying; however, she was perfectly fine in her role as Julie's friend.The biggest lost opportunity this movie had was the fact that it didn't really explain what happened to the fisherman's hand at the end of the first film.  He didn't mention that it had been cut off in his final confrontation with Julie.  And he didn't explain exactly how he went about attaching the hook as a sort-of prosthetic hand.Overall, I clearly loved this movie.

(I think Weaver and Ryder knew the truth, because, wow, were they just walking through their roles.) The best of all the Alien films was the first Alien. Why? I can think of three reasons right off the bat -- 1) Ridley Scott directed masterfully (especially for a first feature film), 2) this was a film based on characters (even the alien) and not gadgets, and 3) because in Alien the idea was new and fresh, it was (dare I say it?) original. And credit Scott that it was at least as suspenseful as Hitchcock's very best -- possibly more so. For Aliens John Cameron (writer, director) thought the original idea was good, so instead of being original himself he threw a bunch of money at it. He tossed in some unnecessary back story, filled the screen with gadgets and people in black rubber suits crawling through the air conditioning ducts atop sound stages at Fox, and had nearly all the characters play it either over the top (Bill Paxton comes to mind) or over-simplistically. Do you really want me to believe that, with the exception of Vasquez and Hicks, those intergalactic Marines were a group of tough hombres? But then, maybe Cameron was just practising for Titanic, great eye-candy with little or no script support (he co-wrote) or depth of character.

This is a sham and a shame, and I don't recommend it even slightly. The acting was as dry as the Arabian desert, the action was beyond belief and tolerance, and the actors-Yikes! The only reason Clooney and Silverstone got the part was because at the time they were popular, a fad as short lived as Chris Rock. Silverstone as Batgirl was pointless and useless, while Clooney was bland and inhuman, I won't even try to tell you how annoying and immature Robin was. However, the actors can't be blamed, just like in photographs, the photographer is the main ingredient, in movies it is the director and writers. Bob Kane, who was one of the best writers for the Batman series, helped with the first two, with Tim Burton, (best director) Danny Elfman, (best music) and, of course Keaton, (best batman.) Bob Kane should be given the job of writing Batman 5, he would do a better job than the writers now could, and not only because Bob Kane passed on a while ago, but because being placed in a blender on liquify would be more enjoyable than listening the the countless one-liners spewing forth like so much mindless drivel. Joel Schumacher (is that right?) has managed to not only tarnish, but completely trash the Batman franchise made by Burton. With momotonous thoughtless action scenes, and awful characters, this movie, once part of the proud batman series, now goes on the shelf kept in the back closet of Hollywood. You know, the shelf with all the other American film industry whorehouse classics, such as but not limited to I still know what you did last summer, The Peacemaker, and, perhaps the most frightening of all, The Blues Brothers 2000. All those movies made the fatal mistake of trying rather blatantly to cash-in on the success of the movies that preceded them, and the belief that most people just want idiotic action, and no actual character development.

The movie is not even, god help us, about Welles' descent from the heights into slumming it in a Grade B flick.The movie is about two things  film-making, and character. Every shot worth remembering (and there are few that aren't) is an exercise in the possibilities of film, particularly black and white film. Woody Allen makes movies in black and white that are  all conversation. Welles made movies in black and white because that's where the colors of the characters, the location and ultimately the meaning of the movie are possible. Black and white film is about the infinite possibilities of shadow. Touch of Evil is about the infinite possibilities of human nature.Heston, for those of you who just can't see past a bad accent is about rigidity and short-sightedness. What kind of idiot would leave his wife in all those threatening situations? The kind of idiot who can't imagine that anyone would harm HIS wife, simply because she IS his wife! Akim Tamiroff's Grandi is about flexibility to the point of breakage. Always playing ALL ends against the middle he is the essence of harmless corruption, that ultimately harms everyone.And Welles' Hank Quinlan ... I just don't have the time or space to explain that Quinlan is about the true cost of police work when the humanity has gone out of it. Ultimately Quinlan would kill his best and only friend, the only one, as Dietrich has it, who really loves him. At one time, perhaps, Quinlan WAS the image that Pete  Menzies saw. But the man behind that image was eaten up long ago with alcohol and frustrated grief. It's all about winning and losing now, and things he would never do. Until he does them.There are so many other moments and characters that I'm afraid you'll just have to watch the film with your eyes and your mind open instead of shut to get it. Pay attention to what's on the screen instead of the smart, cynical, hip comments you can make about an actual work of heart.Well, what the hell. Joan Didion said it best.

Touch of Evil is about the infinite possibilities of human nature.Heston, for those of you who just can't see past a bad accent is about rigidity and short-sightedness. What kind of idiot would leave his wife in all those threatening situations? The kind of idiot who can't imagine that anyone would harm HIS wife, simply because she IS his wife! Akim Tamiroff's Grandi is about flexibility to the point of breakage. Always playing ALL ends against the middle he is the essence of harmless corruption, that ultimately harms everyone.And Welles' Hank Quinlan ... I just don't have the time or space to explain that Quinlan is about the true cost of police work when the humanity has gone out of it. Ultimately Quinlan would kill his best and only friend, the only one, as Dietrich has it, who really loves him. At one time, perhaps, Quinlan WAS the image that Pete  Menzies saw. But the man behind that image was eaten up long ago with alcohol and frustrated grief. It's all about winning and losing now, and things he would never do. Until he does them.There are so many other moments and characters that I'm afraid you'll just have to watch the film with your eyes and your mind open instead of shut to get it. Pay attention to what's on the screen instead of the smart, cynical, hip comments you can make about an actual work of heart.Well, what the hell. Joan Didion said it best.

The movie is not about Heston's Mexican-ness or lack of it. The movie is not about the 5 or 8 or 10 minute opening shot. The movie is not even, god help us, about Welles' descent from the heights into slumming it in a Grade B flick.The movie is about two things  film-making, and character. Every shot worth remembering (and there are few that aren't) is an exercise in the possibilities of film, particularly black and white film. Woody Allen makes movies in black and white that are  all conversation.

It is one of the more atmospheric and stylish films I have seen. It would have even topped Se7en as one of my favourite films, except for one thing.The ending!  When Van Orton jumps off the edge of the building, we hear Christine scream his name and then see visions of his father.  Right there! That's where should've been taken to another ending where Van Orton dies, just like his father.I believe that was the original intention, it might have even been filmed. But the ending that is in the movie seems too much like a tacked-on Hollywood ending.  They show the downbeat ending to a test audience, they don't like it because it's not Armaggedon or something.  So the studio have to reshoot & rewrite the ending (That's where I think the Gonna shear some more sheep line comes from, it sounds like it was written in a hurry).Why? Why? Why?  You had a brilliant movie WITH the downbeat ending.  That's why I ask David Fincher to please, please release a Director's Cut.  I know the real ending is out there somewhere.

Another example of extreme self-indulgence by the director and the special effects people. What made things worse was that the watcher was expected to figure out who exactly A.S's character really was, he did not know himself. The violence done to the human frame in this type of film with no apparent ill effect always spoils any enjoyment that might be gained from these stories. Outrageous plots are acceptable, being exposed to several minutes of the vacuum of Mars with instant recovery when an earth-like atmosphere with blue skies and fluffy clouds is manufactured is too much.
