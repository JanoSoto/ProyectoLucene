Mr. Blume is outwardly successful (owns a steel mill, drives a BWM), but he's miserable until he meets Max and rekindles his enthusiasm for life.  Miss Cross is an intelligent woman who is given two choices first between Max and Mr. Blume, but ultimately her choice is whether she wants a relationship again or to stay faithful to her dead husband.Some people just don't get Rushmore -- it's a difficult movie to latch onto, and not always easy to like.

In the movie, Jim Carrey plays Fletcher Reed, a divorced lawyer whose son named Max wishes that he could tell nothing but the truth for just one day.  Well the wish comes true.  Unfortunately for Fletcher it causes a lot of problems.  He can no longer keep secrets, which causes him to embarass himself.  For example, he tells a woman in the park just exactly what he thinks of her and she slaps him.  Later, his son, ex-wife, and her future husband are on their way to Boston.  Good old Fletcher comes to stop them with some comic tactics like hiding in a suitcase and using some wheelstairs to take him to the departing airplane.  Eventually, a bunch of luggage falls on him leaving him injured.  Max, ex-wife, and the future husband come out of the plane.  Fletcher tells his son just how much he wishes he could've spent time with him but was just too busy with his job to do so.  The mother asks him if he really means it. Max says, Of course, mom, he has to tell the truth!  Reed tells Max that the wish wore off and things are back to normal.  At Max's next birthday, the lights temporarily go off and when they turn on again, Reed and his ex-wife are kissing.  Reed asks Max if he wished for them to get back together.  Max says, No,dad, I wished for some new rollerblades!  This is a wonderful movie that everyone should watch.

Our health teacher decided to show us a movie. In a boring tone of voice he said, OK, we're going to watch a movie about a college student who graduates and what he does and decisions he makes. We all thought we were in for a boring film. And the film we got was Tommy Boy!I don't usually go for movies like this, but this one's a riot. The whole road trip story is funny, and David Spade gets off some of the best one-liners you'll ever hear.

But when Fox announced they were making a tv movie of it, I was apprehensive. Americans don't generally appreciate British tastes. But, I loved the show, so I held out hope. When the movie aired, it was awful. Hideous. The only redeeming part being that it had Sylvester Mccoy in it.What's the point? The X-Files movie is awful. It's a complete disaster. I was a fan of the series and when I saw the movie I gave up on the show. I watched 3 or 4 years for *that*?? The government is working with the aliens, because they'd wipe us out if they didn't? Huh? I don't even care if I'm getting the plot wrong. That's the whole point.Whatever. Talk about your serious letdowns. I think it's obvious that Cris Carter has no creative energies left. Millennium tanked. Harsh Realm lasted what, 15 minutes of its first showing?This movie is just a bunch of different episodes patched together. We get the informant that gets killed. Ooh! Shocking! That's never happened on the show before! We get Mulder and Scully reassigned. Gasp! Scully gets kidnapped! Holy god! How original!I've joked to other friends about this. Mulder should call the guinness book of world records people. Scully obviously has to have the record for most times being kidnapped.Another problem, and this is one I have with the tv series too. Why do they keep referring to each other by name, even when they're alone? If someone did that to me, I would be very worried. But then all of Hollywood has nameitis.

I am not a big sci-fi fan and even less of a horror fan, I was prepared to be underwhelmed.  In fact, I was extremely impressed, not with the story, but with the filmmaking, particularly the direction by Rand Ravich.The story was a patchwork of a lot of different worn out sci-fi themes.  There was the alien takes over the human theme, the alien dwells among us theme and of course, the evil baby gestating in the good and pure mother theme.  Suffice it to say that this wasn't fresh material.  But let's be honest; how many stories are really fresh material?  Why are we suckers for the same old romantic comedy storylines again and again and yet we expect that sci-fi must be completely novel to be good?What is outstanding about this film is the suspense.  I haven't seen a film that was so effective as a suspense film in quite some time.  It was effective because of daring use of the camera by Ravich that visually left me begging for relief in scene after scene.  Actually, if there is any criticism of this film it is the fact that the suspense was too well done.  It wears the viewer out without sufficient mental rest stops.Ravich's use of extreme close ups, wide angle shots, rapid camera movements, odd perspectives, and tight sets produces a sense of relentless suspense that made me want jump into the screen and yell at the characters.  For some, this was probably overwhelming and tedious.  It seems that viewers today want pace, novelty and surprises.  Yes, we knew Spencer (Johnny Depp) was now an alien.  Yes, we knew that Jillian (Charlize Theron) had alien babies growing inside her.  What we didn't know was what she was going to do about it and what he was going to do about her.  So I thought the story was ultimately effective in achieving its goal...thrilling suspense.What this film lacked was a hideous monster and a lot of blood and gore.  This is why it wasn't popular in my opinion because these are staples of today's mass market viewer.  This is the very reason I thought it was excellent because it produced fear and anticipation, not by what was seen, but by what was unseen.From an acting perspective, this was a shining moment for Charlize Theron.  This was a very demanding film for a female lead and she handled it like a pro.  Her part demanded a full range of emotions from sweet adoring wife to the terror of a caged animal and she delivered the most complete performance I've seen from her to date.  As a matter of fact, Theron so controlled the screen that Johnny Depp didn't really have much to do except give the occasional menacing look.I'm going to buck the tide with this one and give it an 8\/10.  This film was about style.  It failed to deliver the obvious and this elusiveness made it unique among all the weird science fiction rip-them-to-shreds hack movies that jam the video store shelves.

The soundtrack is excellent for the film, but paradoxically not very memorable (apart from one or two good songs).I wish I'd been born before 1981 (maybe 1961) so that I could have lived in the late-70s and 80s, and would have memories of the best music from that time, and not the boybands\/Beatles clones\/dance ditties (not decent tunes mind) we have now.All in all an (almost) perfect film watch it and you'll (most likely) enjoy it and watch it again and again.

Most of them have been said by other reviewers anyway.I saw Amadeus in a theater when it first came out, applauded wildly when it won I don't know how many Academy Awards, and have enjoyed it any number of times on video since then.  Peter Schaffer brilliantly adapted his play, which became even more dramatic and human onscreen. The story is moving and profound, and the performances wonderful.  F. Murray Abraham was truly brilliant as the tormented mediocrity Salieri.  So was Tom Hulce as the callow genius Mozart.  Not too-often mentioned is Roy Dotrice as Papa Mozart; he was great, as was Jeffrey Jones in a slyly funny performance as the officious but empty-headed Emperor. I was delighted by the fact that the film avoided the stuffiness so often associated with period drama.  I will even confess that I giggle just as insanely as Amadeus every time Salieri calls Mozart The Creature!  The scene where Salieri takes dictation from Mozart and we see artistic creation happening must be one of the greatest ever put on screen. I hope everyone takes the opportunity to see this wonderful film on video. OK, I do have some more serious stuff to say.  As a budding screenwriter myself, I was impressed by the writer's attention to depth of character, and subtle, interlocking themes.  As a student of cultural history, I was fascinated by how much history really came across onscreen.  Not necessarily historical fact (I know that Salieri didn't murder Mozart, and most likely didn't try, and there were undoubtedly many other inaccuracies, due to the need for condensation).  When I think history, I usually think of the history of ideas.  And if you want to look at the historical development that took place from the idea of the artist dedicated to God, and the modern one of an artist as a tormented individual, striving for excellence on his own, you can see it in Salieri.  And the film also made it clear how the coming revolutionary changes in 18th-19th Europe were to carry the artist from having to please a patron to having to make it in a democratic marketplace (well, until the founding of the NEA, anyway).  Just compare this film to that odious monstrosity Shakespeare in Love, which also, inconceivably, won a Best-Pictur Oscar!  There, nothing goes beyond dull sitcom contrivance and cliches about the theater, and the conception of the characters is so thoroughly twentieth-century that no real historical ideas can possibly get though.

However, that is only in retrospect, I actually really enjoyed watching it.  This is not a credit to either of the lead characters, Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock, both of whom I usually love, came off trite and type-cast...  and despite their vain attempts to be tough they presented as so sugar sweet I couldn't eat chocolate for a week following.  No, I enjoyed this movie for one reason, the supporting cast.  Blythe Danner as mother of the bride is elegant, graceful, real, and lovely as always.  We see where her daughter gets her talent.  Steven Zahn is hilarious.  I never cease to be entertained by his sharp-wit and perfect timing.  But most of the credit for saving this film belongs to Maura Tierney.  Her scenes provide much welcome respites from the ridiculous antics of Affleck and Bullock.  Tierney is wry and funny, not to mention terribly appealing.  The audience finds itself rooting for her happiness and cursing Affleck's boneheaded attempt at a tryst.  Tierney's performance adds a much needed earth to a film that spends most of its time on the fringes of the clouds.  She grounds it gracefully, creating the center of mass around which all other insanities and adulteries and abnormalities can revolve, because she is sure of two things...  herself and her love for her fiance.  Maura Tierney makes it worth the rent, Blythe Danner and Steven Zahn help it breathe...  now all you have to do is ignore the stars of the film.

But even if this movie wasn't based on a real singing superstar, it would have been great to watch anyway.Jennifer Lopez is stunning in every way as Selena. She hits all the right chords as a teenager, a woman in love, a dutiful daughter and sister, and a singer adored by legions of fans. And she loved everyone of them right back. The actors playing her family are all great, too (especially her father). Ms. Lopez also has a sweet, natural chemistry with Jon Seda as Chris. Their relationship is so real because they were friends first...friends who fell in love.Ms. Lopez also does a great job lip-synching Selena's songs, and the ending will bring tears to your eyes. A must see!
