I enjoy The Land Before Time, another movie by him, so naturally I had quite high expectations for this movie. However, it was a big disappointment.Right from the beginning, the story has shown how silly it is. Somehow, the movie's heroine is willing to risk the safety of her three children, and waste a lot of time doing all kinds of dangerous errands just because 'the air is bad' for her fourth child. Why not just find a warm blanket, wrap him up and run? With all those people around, they could even carry his bed with him on it. That whole deal is clearly just a poor excuse to get the story going. And then things got worse. Characters just keep appearing out of nowhere with dim intentions and unexplained relations. What is the relationship between the Great Owl and the rats? What is the rats' plan exactly? What does the villain really want? How does NIHM know about their hideout? And what's so special about NIHM if normal mice like Mrs Brisby can do what those rats and mice from NIHM do anyway? Questions after questions about the plot keep popping up but never get answered. Finally comes the horrible ending which was just a total deus ex machina. The rats, who before that point were just intelligent animals that relied on technology, somehow managed to create magical artifacts, which the heroine was given for some unknown reasons, and then used to save the day. The end. An utterly terrible and lazy excuse of a plot.The animation, despite being quite good for its time, especially with the special effects, is still not really satisfying for me due to the simple and unimaginative backgrounds. And the sound editing is just terrible compared to Disney movies of the same period. To sum up, this movie may be good for the 1980s thanks to having a more complex plot than most other animated movies at the time, but judging from today's point of view, it's a very flawed and forgettable product.

However, after the latter film left me so numb, I thought it was best to leave films dealing with religion and Jesus Christ dormant for a while due to that film being so heavy and jarring in its depictions of violence and graphic content. I made the wise decision, for a college course I'm currently enrolled in called religion and ethics in film has kicked off by showing The Last Temptation of Christ in its entirety, allowing free-form discussion and conversation to take place regarding its allegedly blasphemous depictions of Jesus Christ and the gospels along with its radically unconventional approach to biblical characters.Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader create the most original works involving our Lord and Savior that I, and undoubtedly countless others, have ever seen. The film involves Jesus Christ (played by Willem Dafoe) as a man entirely unsure of himself and his own ability to be the strong, reliant son of God. The film opens showing Jesus Christ making crosses for the Romans to crucify Jews on, already kicking off the film on a note of complete shock to anyone who has read and studied the gospels. In the film, Jesus is close friends with Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel), who deviates from his role in The Bible dramatically to frequently challenge and question the motivations of Jesus Christ while simultaneously trying to believe he is the noble messiah that is to be trusted and followed. Finally, there's the third central character of the film, Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey), who has turned to prostitution following Jesus's rejection of her offers of fulfilling his sexual desires.Throughout the film, Jesus is tempted by many things, such as doubt, depression, uncertainty, fear, and lust, prompting visions of carrying out sexual desires with women. Initially, any devout or simply practicing Christian will look at The Last Temptation with an understandable uneasiness about such narrative inclusions like Jesus carrying out sexual desires, or even being uncertain and fearful of his taxing responsibility to carry out the word of God. Your response to such ideas is dependent on how open you are about hearing a different, pragmatic take on the life of Jesus Christ rather than the frequently institutionalized, dehumanized version of the messiah.We see Jesus Christ not as a holier-than-thou messiah, or a bold and confident individual, sure of the gospel and his duty granted by an almighty god, but instead, a deeply bashful, neurotic soul, grappling with the idea of being both one-hundred percent man and one-hundred percent God. As a result, we get perhaps the most human (notice I didn't say faithful) adaptation of Jesus Christ ever put to film, one that doesn't blind us with the glow of his metaphorical halo and holiness and one that doesn't resort to caricaturing. Despite taking massive creative liberties, Scorsese and Schrader seem to have a great deal of respect for the messiah, as they care about him enough to give him an identity beyond institutionalized scriptures and sloganeering.Furthermore, the humanization of Christ allows Christians to see their Lord and Savior in a light they likely hadn't previously thought of because of such sloganeering. It's strange and unconventional to see a leader be portrayed as bashful and doubtful in himself, but such feelings were likely to be felt by Jesus in at least some manner. Imagine existing as both a man and a god of some kind, burdened by the dictation of a higher power you, yourself, didn't understand, who wanted you to preach the gospel to many who would hate or doubt you, effectively preventing you from carrying out any relationships of your own and grappling with your own sanity? The fact is you cannot imagine it because it's too overwhelming to even conceptualize; it's not of this natural world.Regardless of how you want to view The Last Temptation of Christ, one cannot deny its ability to provoke some kind of feeling between believers and non-believers. It's a film that sits with you, unnerves you, and plays with your emotions in the best possible way. When it was over, the class I was surrounded by was surprisingly vocal, many of whom either shocked about the Jesus Christ they saw or maturely criticizing what they had seen unfold. One woman even said the film was dangerous because it has the potential to give someone unfamiliar with the gospel a completely different and false idea of Christ.

","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"13 January 2015","score":"","review":" Nolan's movies seem to often involve two rival men playing cat and mouse with each-other (most obviously The Prestige but also the Batman films and Insomnia, the rest not as literally but still thematically). It becomes ambiguous as to who is chasing who. They push each-other to extremes and end up going in circles, forget what they cared about so much, wonder where their morals have gone. They eventually realise they're kind of just chasing themselves. What have they become? How did they end up in this mess? There are always twists and lies. They often end up being quite self-destructive and are left wondering how they got this way. The characters reflect back on what's happened and see things in a whole different light. Ultimately we find where the two men differ, some small indestructible principle they each carry with them.His movies always probe the mind, human nature. They're about trust, memories, manipulation, guilt and anger, the way our decisions affect us over time, the way we lie to ourselves and try to keep our belief system intact. He questions why we do things, why we feel so certain about ourselves and then keeps showing us things that make it clear how little we really know. It's like with magic, we only get tricked because of our own incorrect assumptions and we make them all the time, automatically. Is that really a normal pack of cards? Has he swapped it at any stage? Is this person really my friend? Can I believe anything they say?There are interesting similarities to Memento, particularly the fact that the story has a non-linear timeline (a technique made famous in Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects). It's also in black and white and the main character is a bit neurotic and we hear his inner monologue. There are physical changes that make it clear where we are in time although following it all (accidental pun) can be tricky. And it's presented in a logical order that increases the tension as we gradually learn more about who did what and why.It's short but engaging and satisfying nevertheless. For $6000, it's pretty impressive. The acting is fine but could be better. The characters only focus on each-other, like they know they're in a movie.

All I see and absorb is in human's view. Again, human as a truly human. Not just the physical appearance, a bunch of talent, or even the incapability. Human is indeed the conscience itself, the feeling of empathy, or we can say the very soul of human. It is connected with characterization of the movie. The more human the character is, it indicates the rate of the movie. But, that's technical. In addition, the biography-movie must have very strong character and improvisation. And, Amadeus drives away the human value in a delightful way.Of course, nobody will not expect what a vulgar man Mozart would be. We just live in a different era with him. The movie just capture the reflection of Mozart by his letter, so we can enjoy Mozart that has peculiar personality. I give applause for Tom Hulce, he gave his best for this monumental role. A strong protagonist combined with the stronger antagonist, just make the complication feels so perfect. How wonderful F. Murray Abraham act for this cinema. He deserved the Oscar, without a doubt. The feature simply about two sides of the paradigm, we can understand how Mozart and his rival, Salieri, defines how they walk their life. You know, it's just make me realized, that even the talented man like Mozart, still had so many classic problems, like family, economics, or relationship. Meanwhile, Forman crafted the act well with the other elements of movies. Such as, the music. Of course it's about a musician, you must make the great play-list in the movie-sequence. So do the make- up-artist and the setting-maker, great work for them. At least, you can really feel the atmosphere of Vienna in that century by watching it. At last, the scenario is just a breakthrough of the biopic- movie. In my opinion, the historical correct is the best way to define each person. Yes, I know some of the part is incorrect, but the personality of each role is nearly perfect. A history-adviser accompanied Forman to make this movie. Of course, Forman can't follow all the historical-advice, he is more concerns with the entertaining way to provide that history. And he did it awesomely.

Unfortunately, Mozart didn't master it. He is genius in one way, but idiot in another way. Amadeus brought all that value in a very emotional way. It's 3 hours though, but you won't regret it. There are always reasons why someone make this movie this long.So, that's all I need to say. I give nine out of ten for all those aspects and value.

The main characters reveal themselves hilariously, while Nicholas Cage's voice-over regales as classic understatement. The dialogue remains offbeat and original, with only occasional lapses. Cage and Hunter often sound as if they've watched too much Oprah, rambling on about the family unit, or his description of her infertility as insides too barren for my seed to get a purchase. With this film the Coen Bros. prove they can do comedy as expertly as melodrama, as does Cage, whose mix-master hairdo and bewildered expression reflect the social rules he just can't seem to get right. Only businessman Nathan Arizona remains a sane sensible voice throughout, a departure for the usually anti-business world of film. Almost stealing the show is William Forsythe as Evelle the quarter-wit brother of half-wit John Goodman. His gap-toothed grin and eternal high spirits amidst a starkly blank expression remind me of a demented Cheshire cat. The movie as a whole amounts to a light-hearted jape at family obsessed America, where by Hunter's logic some peoples has too many kids while others ain't got enough, so it's okay to take from them that has too many. Sort of like socialist logic applied to child distribution. On a more ominous note is a Keystone Cops indictment of gun-toting America, where too many civilians and cops alike come armed and ready to shoot, except Cage who reveals a benign inner nature by refusing to load. Only the epilogue and Randy Cobb disappoint. Cobb certainly looks the part of cartoon evil, but can't project the menace to go with it. With these dim but lovable characters, it's obvious the Bros. were at sea in figuring out how to end. It's as though they're suddenly embarrassed with the liberties taken with the institution of family, so only a Norman Rockwell level of smarmy apology can compensate. Too bad, because the compensation is already there in the characters of H.I. and Ed (Cage & Hunter). Nonetheless, the movie remains fresh and rollicking, thrusting the Coens to the forefront of independent filmmakers, and presenting the audience with a good number of belly laughs along the way.

Even if you ignore the fact that it is a terrific cast full of familiar faces and stars that went onto to be superstars, the story and the concept and the writing and the ethical and moral dilemma that comes out of this will be talked about for decades. Grisham created one of the best legal thrillers ever and who better because the man practically created the genre. Translating it to the big screen would be no small feat but I think they went a step beyond and captured the book and the characters very nearly flawlessly. The film runs a little long, I'm not sure given that it is technically a thriller moreso than a drama that it should feel like it drags just a little bit but I can't fault them for making sure the characters and idea is fully developed. The best thing to come out of A Time To Kill is the dialogue. The script for this film written by Akiva Goldsman is brilliant and masterful. He has done some great screenplays (we'll forgive him Batman and Robin and Lost In Space) but this is truly one of his best. Fortunately for him he also had some incredible actors delivering the lines.Matthew McConaughey is perfect as the struggling lawyer Jake Brigance. No one can play down to earth better than McConaughey and his charisma is brilliant on screen. He also plays a darn good lawyer. His closing speech is one of my favourite scenes in film. Samuel L Jackson perfectly plays the father who murders his daughter's rapists in cold blood. Jackson is emotional and moving in his role and the chemistry between he and McConaughey is very good. There are such incredible actors in this film and the one criticism I can give the film is that I feel like once you move away from the main cast, some of the supporting cast doesn't get the screen time they could have or deserve. Kevin Spacey is good but underused as the cocky DA Rufus Buckley and Sandra Bullock is feisty and fun and a very strong female lead but underused in her role. Oliver Platt who was always good for the sarcastic, fun but serious looking supporting character does exactly that in this film. Donald Sutherland is also terrific as Brigance's mentor but I wanted to see more of him. Kiefer Sutherland couldn't be better playing the smarmy and evil looking brother of one of the dead rapists. Ashley Judd is sort of flash in the pan as McConaughey's wife.This was Joel Schumacher at his best. He was a great director at one time but has slipped in recent years. This was a great example of the sort of vision he once had. He captures the racial tension of the deep south perfectly. You can just feel the air of tumultuous politics. Despite being a courtroom battle, the film is more about the racial battle happening outside the courtroom. The case and situations gives rise to a brand of the KKK and puts Brigance's life in danger and those in his life around him in danger as well. The opening scenes of the film are literally hard to watch, one of the most disturbing rape scenes in film and yet not because its graphically done or shown in poor taste but rather you feel and sense the danger and horrible act that is being done to a defenceless little girl. A Time To Kill is terrific. Its more art than entertainment because of the concepts behind it but if you love legal drama, thrillers, courtroom battles or just a very good film then this is one to see. 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 January 2015","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is the sort of film that I am certain in 30 or 40 years will be considered a classic.

The opening scenes of the film are literally hard to watch, one of the most disturbing rape scenes in film and yet not because its graphically done or shown in poor taste but rather you feel and sense the danger and horrible act that is being done to a defenceless little girl.

Even if you ignore the fact that it is a terrific cast full of familiar faces and stars that went onto to be superstars, the story and the concept and the writing and the ethical and moral dilemma that comes out of this will be talked about for decades. Grisham created one of the best legal thrillers ever and who better because the man practically created the genre. Translating it to the big screen would be no small feat but I think they went a step beyond and captured the book and the characters very nearly flawlessly. The film runs a little long, I'm not sure given that it is technically a thriller moreso than a drama that it should feel like it drags just a little bit but I can't fault them for making sure the characters and idea is fully developed. The best thing to come out of A Time To Kill is the dialogue. The script for this film written by Akiva Goldsman is brilliant and masterful. He has done some great screenplays (we'll forgive him Batman and Robin and Lost In Space) but this is truly one of his best. Fortunately for him he also had some incredible actors delivering the lines.Matthew McConaughey is perfect as the struggling lawyer Jake Brigance. No one can play down to earth better than McConaughey and his charisma is brilliant on screen. He also plays a darn good lawyer. His closing speech is one of my favourite scenes in film. Samuel L Jackson perfectly plays the father who murders his daughter's rapists in cold blood. Jackson is emotional and moving in his role and the chemistry between he and McConaughey is very good. There are such incredible actors in this film and the one criticism I can give the film is that I feel like once you move away from the main cast, some of the supporting cast doesn't get the screen time they could have or deserve. Kevin Spacey is good but underused as the cocky DA Rufus Buckley and Sandra Bullock is feisty and fun and a very strong female lead but underused in her role. Oliver Platt who was always good for the sarcastic, fun but serious looking supporting character does exactly that in this film. Donald Sutherland is also terrific as Brigance's mentor but I wanted to see more of him. Kiefer Sutherland couldn't be better playing the smarmy and evil looking brother of one of the dead rapists. Ashley Judd is sort of flash in the pan as McConaughey's wife.This was Joel Schumacher at his best. He was a great director at one time but has slipped in recent years. This was a great example of the sort of vision he once had. He captures the racial tension of the deep south perfectly. You can just feel the air of tumultuous politics. Despite being a courtroom battle, the film is more about the racial battle happening outside the courtroom. The case and situations gives rise to a brand of the KKK and puts Brigance's life in danger and those in his life around him in danger as well.

As I noted in my review of that movie, the scene where Katie first has sex with Hubbell challenges our attitude about rape and the double standard. In that case, it had to do with having sex with someone too drunk to have given consent. Summer of '42, on the other hand, challenges our attitude about rape and the double standard when it comes to having sex with someone too young to have given consent.With both movies, we pretty much have the same three time periods the 1940s, when the movies were set; the early 1970s, when the movies were made; and today, when we watch them from the perspective of the twenty-first century. In Summer of '42, a 15-year-old boy named Hermie falls in love with a 22-year-old woman named Dorothy. One evening, she gets word that her husband's plane has been shot down over France, and he is dead. She and Hermie have sex, and the next day she is gone.I never really cared for this movie, but that is neither here nor there. The sense of it was that Dorothy, in her grief, turns to Hermie for affection, and that what happens is a deeply meaningful and positive experience for him. Now, I don't know what the laws were in Massachusetts in 1942, but I am pretty sure that in most states, if a 22-year-old man had sex with a 15-year-old girl, he would be guilty of statutory rape, and if found out would be sent to prison, especially when the jury was told that he had sex with her on the very night he found out his wife had been killed, for that would make him seem callous. Should we condemn the man but excuse the woman? Did Dorothy deserve to go to prison for rape, just as a man would?Once again, as with The Way We Were, we have a situation in which there is consent after the fact, in this case, when the boy becomes a man.

And once again we have to distinguish between the attitudes existing when the movie was set, when it was made, and the attitudes we have today.Even today, the double standard lends itself to late-night humor.

Edward Scissorhands was the first film they collaborated on and is probably considered by most to be their best. For me I think the film is a bit overrated. It wants us to believe that this is a man we should all feel sorry for, which we do, but it also tries to convince us that his wrongdoings aren't his fault. While I believe this 'man' deserves to be treated like a human, but I don't think mixing him with other humans and not thinking chaos would eventually happen was the right move.Depp is great as the title role. In fact it's hard to believe anybody else really playing this role. For once he actually gave a tremendous amount of subtly to this strange role and he also gave it a lot of heart. But the problem is that I don't think the supporting characters were developed enough. Not only that, but I don't think any of them actually seem like people who would live in a real world. Perhaps that's the point. Winona Ryder's character has a far too sudden change of mind half way through the film, and her boyfriend is the most clichéd ex boyfriend ever. But I did enjoy watching Depp play this character. And I think his 'mother' had some really great scenes with him as well.So the problem isn't so much the actual story but rather the execution. There are few Burton movies that I thoroughly enjoy so perhaps my problem is more so with him than the rest of the crew. His films tend to be split down the middle with audiences so I think this may be one that I have to sit on and re-watch for further appreciation.+Depp's subtly emotional performance +Dianne West -clichéd characters-Style over substance 6.0\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 January 2015","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" If you had to name the most famous director-actor collaborations working in Hollywood today, I would bet Johnny Depp and Tim Burton are among the first you would name.

Big Brother had aired in the summer of 2000 and dominated the tabloids while Pop Idol and Survivor both debuted the following year to equal success. But the backlash was already beginning and it started with this razor-sharp parody that took the genre to its logical conclusion. But this doesn't just illustrate the problems with reality TV - it shines a light on the depraved, fame-hungry individuals who will literally do anything in order to get on TV for their fifteen minutes of fame. Catching up with it again today, I was reminded not only of how far ahead of its time it was but also how scarily accurate it was. One suspects that it's only a matter of time before such a chilling scenario appears for real.The film is presented as a series-long broadcast of a show called The Contenders in which five randomly chosen people are each given a gun and thrown into a battle to the death with the sixth entry, the winner of the previous series. For this, the seventh series, current champion Dawn (Brooke Smith) is heavily pregnant and determined to be victorious again as her freedom is due once she wins. Returning to her hometown, she is pitched into battle with college student Lindsay (Merritt Wever), unemployed thug Tony (Michael Kaycheck), Christian nurse Connie (Marylouise Burke), paranoid conspiracy theorist Franklin (Richard Venture) and cancer patient Jeff (Glenn Fitzgerald). As the series progresses and the body count rises, each contestants secrets are revealed in front of the nation. Will Dawn survive for the sake of her unborn child or will another of the Contenders take her crown? Series 7 The Contenders is a spot-on parody of the countless shows of this nature that pollute our screens on a daily basis. Writer\/director Daniel Minahan's use of graphics and narration (provided by Will Arnett) perfectly apes the genre so well that you have to remind yourself that it is a movie and not an actual show. The mostly unknown cast also add to the illusion that this is really happening - Smith's foul-mouthed mother-to-be is a brilliant character and you root for her throughout, even if her morals are somewhat twisted. But then again, this feels like a slightly different America - when she blows away an old guy at a cash desk, few of the other people present bat an eyelid because they see the TV cameras there and realise it's a show. And without meaning to, the movie also parodies those desperate souls who wish to partake in these ridiculous shows. No detail is too graphic and no secret is too big to be splashed in front of the cameras, all for the sake of entertainment. I loved the moment when the previously loyal Lindsay confronts her pushy parents and even stabs one of them and then, seconds later, she's expressing her undying love for them. The film reeks of hypocrisy, as it should. It leaves the same nauseating taste in your mouth that most reality shows do.There will be some who don't get the joke, probably those people who believe that the likes of The Only Way Is Essex and I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here! are documentaries. But I can't stand these reality shows which have about as much reality in them as a Mark Rothko exhibition. Series 7 The Contenders remains a solid and stark reflection on a subculture of TV and TV viewers that have abandoned reason and logic in the pursuit of audience numbers, even if it smashes the point home over and over again. The movie does have a very strong 'indie' feel to it (or 'low budget' if you're being unkind) and it's impossible to listen to Joy Division again without thinking of the movie. But I have a lot of respect for this movie and would recommend you try and watch it. And whatever you do, please keep telling yourself that it's just a movie...

Plot In A Paragraph Dean Youngblood (Rob Lowe) a 17-year-old farmhand from New York, has dreams of playing in the National Hockey League. He is granted the chance to travel to Canada to try out for the Hamilton Mustangs. At the try-outs, Youngblood displays the talent which got him 92 goals in the New York League but also displays a lack of physical toughness that is so prized in Canadian hockey. This weakness is pounced upon by a brutish player, Carl Racki (George J. Finn), who is also trying out for the team and engages him in a fight. Youngblood quickly learns that flashiness and pure athletic ability will not be enough to be successful in this league. Despite being beat up by by Racki, the coach opts to select Youngblood for a spot on the team. He ingratiates himself to the other players and particularly Captain Derek Sutton (Patrick Swayze) and the coach's daughter Jessie (Cynthia Gibb), its not long before Racki reappears playing for a rival team. Rob Lowe is good as Dean Youngblood, he is pretty enough for the pretty boy tag and looks in good shape. Cynthia Gibb is very attractive as Jessie Chadwick, and what an ass she has!! I loved it!! Ed Lauter is a lot of fun as Coach Murray Chadwick and George J. Finn is imposing and does a good job as Carl Racki. However Patrick Swayze steals this movie (yes even away from Cynthia Gibb's wonderful ass) as Derek Sutton. He is brilliant, and a reminder of what a talent we have lost.
