It is definitely not a masterpiece like, e.g., Murnau's Nosferatu, where you will remember the first appearance of Max Schreck in the gate with a far remote camera until your last day.First, I do not understand why it was considered necessary to put a subsidiary story into the main story. Se7en has a default dramaturgy, due to the 7 sins, as, e.g. The Lodger (2007) has a default structure, due to the killings of Jack the Ripper, not to mention the Zodiac killer movies, etc. Why was it necessary to put the character of Brad Pitt besides the character of Morgan Freeman? Both are in the rank of detectives - the older is a highlight, the younger a zero - the older stands above marriage, the younger is unable to be a good husband and future father and meanwhile enjoys his three of four dogs. But not enough with that The writer of Se7en considered it also important to build in a cross-relation, when Paltrow's character contacts Freeman without letting know Pitt. This one scene as well as their common gathering for a dinner are without any sense for the story, it is painful for Freeman's character - and for the real audience.Second, after having watched this movie a second time, it has lost all of its initial effects.

The first thirty minutes or so were great, and formed a classic intro for a horror movie. TCM takes the first thirty minutes or so, to create memorable, and individual characters. The beginning also has humor in it, which is very important, (if not essential) for a great horror film. Without humor horror movies can come across as too stark, in my opinion...This isn't just true for horror movies, but just about every genre. If a movie doesn't have any humor, you just start to think, Why so Serious? This was not the case with TCM though, the beginning of the movie was pretty funny, and realistic. The problem with this movie was, once the group of kids visited the grandfathers house, and all of them were kidnapped, the plot starting falling apart. I've noticed that this is a typical problem in slasher films. Like, its good for a slasher film to have memorable characters, but they are always killed off early in the movie. At this point the plot is between the protagonist, and the crazy killer. This killer often is a very silent one. So, what you have towards the end of the general slasher movie is long, drawn out scenes of the killer chasing the victim, with the victim screaming at the top of her lungs, helplessly.Now, these scenes can be very good, if they are filmed well, and\/or are scary. But for some reason, the scenes in Chainsaw were not that scary, especially the chase scenes. There were a few moderately scary scenes (i.e. the kids going into the deserted house), though these could have been a lot scarier if they had used more of a suspenseful soundtrack. (This may not be essential in the chase scenes actually, as the wailing of the chainsaw is not only intimidating enough, though I don't believe any music could be heard over it) Overall, I thought TCM was a important but somewhat marginal horror film. The movie was influential to the developing of the slasher genre. I had wanted to see it for a long time. But I'm still glad I saw it. The movie actually functioned very well until the last 30 minutes. (The Dinner scenes, and the Gas Station scenes) At the point of this part of the movie, it had lost nearly all of its appeal. These scenes were also incredibly weird, and didn't mix well with the rest of the movie. The scenes toward the end were supposed to be terrifying I guess but they were really dated. The last five or so minutes were very good though. It has some great scenes, and is entertaining, but is overall a little disappointing. But slasher fans might like it. I'm not a huge fan of the slasher genre, as a whole, but there are a couple of them I enjoyed.

One night the duo are attacked by a werewolf where Jack is ripped to shreds and killed but David lives. Soon he's going to regret surviving because when the moon is full he too turns into a wild beast. I watch this film after every five years or so and it's rather amazing to see how well it holds up with each passing year as time has certainly been kind to the movie. This isn't really a horror film or a comedy but instead it's pure Landis, which means you're going to have just about everything thrown in from graphic violence and gore to some great comedy moments and even some rather sad moments. It seems Landis wanted to make two or three different movies but crammed everything into this one and in the end everything mixes quite well together. There's no question that in the end this is still a horror film as it's these moments that are most memorable. The most famous sequence is the transformation, which is still rather eye opening nearly thirty-years after being created. This sequence is certainly amongst the greatest in any werewolf picture and they rightfully got Baker an Oscar. Another great moment is the opening attack, which is pretty intense. I love the way Landis keeps us guessing as to where the beast is and then throws in a brief moment of humor just to throw us off guard. The humor that works is Dunne's decomposing corpse that keeps showing up to warn his friend of what's coming. The make up on him are terrific and really adds some great dark humor. The performances are another major plus as Naughton really makes for a believable man trapped with this curse and he makes us care and feel for everything he does. Jenny Agutter is wonderful as the love interest and she helps make the ending so moving. The soundtrack is another major plus as Landis picked all the moon titles he could get. This early part of the decade delivered quite a few different werewolf movies but after all these years I think it's pretty clear that this one here was the best of the bunch.

A really bad movie can be really good if it's bad for the right reasons and a better movie can be a lot worse for some other reason. When you're counting with camp and schlock, the sum will definitely come out a little different.Sometimes a B-movie can be talked-about, banned in Britain and regarded as a balls-to-the-walls-gorefest even though it's really not that graphic. The Exterminator is an example of this. It's a vigilante action\/thriller, your average take on Death Wish, but despite having quite an eye-catching cover, and despite being banned in Britain and despite being pretty brutal, there are a lot of more shocking movies out there. If you are a gorehound, and I know there's a lot of you out there, I think maybe you're looking for something like Fulci's Contraband or New York Ripper. That's intense. In The Exterminator, we do get a mob boss in a meat grinder and some messy executions to be sure, but nothing that will shock anyone who will actually go looking for a movie like The Exterminator.In this take on civil disobedience on steroids, the late Robert Ginty plays a normal guy who totally flips when his buddy from Vietnam gets paralyzed due to an attack from one of those batches of racist, anarchist scum who randomly act out mayhem in broad daylight. As the exterminator Ginty's character have a few things on his agenda. Steal money from the soon-to-be-bolognese-mob. Check. Kill sodomizing pervs. Check. Shotgun away at guys who rob old ladies. Check. Interrogate his way ahead with a very talk-efficient flame thrower. Double-check. Hum, what else? Oh, right, pull the plug on his veggie buddy without asking his wife and kids about it. Yeah, check.For what it is, The Exterminator is a pretty decent exploitation movie. You can't expect much more than what the cover says. Ginty is an odd hero to boot, but I can't help but liking him. Probably due to his offbeat appearance. Who could ever take him for a lone ranger type action hero? I don't know if he looks like much of anything at all. For something as definitive as an action star, Ginty was fascinatingly bland. And ironically, that comes off as very original! Looking at his resume, somehow, despite any given logic, I feel tempted to check out a movie with the title Maniac Killer.Another thing I have to mention is Christopher George, one of my all time favorite B-movie actors. He was always so suave and self-aware, as if he wasn't really convinced he was actually doing the schlock movies he was doing. In The Exterminator he plays the cop who goes after Ginty. Once again, he wanders about the movie with this self-ironic smirk, as if he's just doing the role, not asking questions and just getting on with it (not entirely unlike Sean Connery in Highlander II). I especially like one dialog scene he has with Samantha Eggar where she asks him about the Vietnam war. It was bad he says with a pause, as if he's amazed at the stupidity of the line. It's as if he's thinking; really? It was bad? Shouldn't I say something else?? It was.... bad he tries to continue, and eventually says Not as bad as New York City... but... it was bad.... The movie makes parallels to the war, but I still can't help but wonder if that was actually in the script, or just some kind of joke from Mr. George. In another scene he misses a line but laughs it off while the camera keeps rolling, and for a moment there you can see him realizing what kind of production he's in.

The Exterminator is an example of this. It's a vigilante action\/thriller, your average take on Death Wish, but despite having quite an eye-catching cover, and despite being banned in Britain and despite being pretty brutal, there are a lot of more shocking movies out there. If you are a gorehound, and I know there's a lot of you out there, I think maybe you're looking for something like Fulci's Contraband or New York Ripper. That's intense. In The Exterminator, we do get a mob boss in a meat grinder and some messy executions to be sure, but nothing that will shock anyone who will actually go looking for a movie like The Exterminator.In this take on civil disobedience on steroids, the late Robert Ginty plays a normal guy who totally flips when his buddy from Vietnam gets paralyzed due to an attack from one of those batches of racist, anarchist scum who randomly act out mayhem in broad daylight. As the exterminator Ginty's character have a few things on his agenda. Steal money from the soon-to-be-bolognese-mob. Check. Kill sodomizing pervs. Check. Shotgun away at guys who rob old ladies. Check. Interrogate his way ahead with a very talk-efficient flame thrower. Double-check. Hum, what else? Oh, right, pull the plug on his veggie buddy without asking his wife and kids about it. Yeah, check.For what it is, The Exterminator is a pretty decent exploitation movie. You can't expect much more than what the cover says. Ginty is an odd hero to boot, but I can't help but liking him. Probably due to his offbeat appearance. Who could ever take him for a lone ranger type action hero? I don't know if he looks like much of anything at all. For something as definitive as an action star, Ginty was fascinatingly bland. And ironically, that comes off as very original! Looking at his resume, somehow, despite any given logic, I feel tempted to check out a movie with the title Maniac Killer.Another thing I have to mention is Christopher George, one of my all time favorite B-movie actors. He was always so suave and self-aware, as if he wasn't really convinced he was actually doing the schlock movies he was doing. In The Exterminator he plays the cop who goes after Ginty. Once again, he wanders about the movie with this self-ironic smirk, as if he's just doing the role, not asking questions and just getting on with it (not entirely unlike Sean Connery in Highlander II). I especially like one dialog scene he has with Samantha Eggar where she asks him about the Vietnam war. It was bad he says with a pause, as if he's amazed at the stupidity of the line. It's as if he's thinking; really? It was bad? Shouldn't I say something else?? It was.... bad he tries to continue, and eventually says Not as bad as New York City... but... it was bad.... The movie makes parallels to the war, but I still can't help but wonder if that was actually in the script, or just some kind of joke from Mr. George. In another scene he misses a line but laughs it off while the camera keeps rolling, and for a moment there you can see him realizing what kind of production he's in. It's a special kind of movie magic that you will only find in a movie like The Exterminator.

Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways.

This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level.

The town's children come down with a mysterious virus and soon they are killing adults apparently with the possessed soul of a boy who died fifty-years earlier. Normally you'd expect the fourth film in a rather mediocre series to be the pits but that's not the case here as we have a fairly good story brought to life with some nice acting and good direction. Watts steals the film as she manages to make her character very believable and shows a good strength, which allows her to carry the movie without any problems. Black is pretty much being Black as she plays the weirdo but who better to do that than her? I was also impressed with Brent Jennings as a father accused of killing him wife and William Windom as the local doctor. The actual story, as with the previous two entries, is far away from King's original short story but that might not be such a bad thing. This entry also contains some of the most brutal killings, which leads to all types of gore. One scene has a farmer getting all the equipment used to rip him apart and the every loving scythes.

This movie makes Orson Welles look better than any other movie I've seen him in, especially in his first shot in the movie.The plot is that the occupation of Vienna by the major powers (Great Britain, US, France, and Soviet Union) leads to a black market. Our naive hero, Holly Martins (played by Cotten), comes to Vienna to see an old chum, only to find that his chum (Harry Lime) was killed in a traffic accident. Holly is just in time for the burial. Lime, it turns out, was selling fake penicillin, placing him on the most-wanted list of most of the police and MPs in town.Director Carol Reed does an excellent job, and Orson Welles is very good as Lime. The city of Vienna has a starring roll as well, which it plays with admirable degradation.* Martins finds out that Lime was involved in the black market in a way that resulted in many deaths, especially among children. There are puzzling aspects about Lime's death (who was the third man at the accident scene, for example), and Martins, who should have left well enough alone and gone home, is involved in the investigation into Lime's chicanery and death and becomes involved with Lime's distraught surviving girlfriend. It's an excellent film that has recently been released in Hi Def on Blu-Ray DVD, which brings all the glory of its black and white shades of gray back from the blotchy blacks of VHS and standard definition. Reed achieved an admirable number of great shots in the film, and using black and white was genius. Vienna has never looked so glamorously demolished.The Third Man has a great ending that book ends the beginning, leaving us no better off than we were. No, we're worse off. Sometimes we don't need to know what we wanted to know. Superb closing scene.*If you liked The Third Man, I recommend reading Hotel New Hampshire by John Irving, which has much of its action taking place in the same town at the same time and which is excellent. The novel is free at your public library. Also listen to Marelene Dietrich sing Falling in Love Again from The Blue Angel. Although performed in the late Twenties, the refrain I can't help it sums up the theme of The Third Man, and Dietrich vocalizes the dreary lostness of post-war Vienna. Look for Marlene on YouTube.

I would make the best effort to catch any movie of his when it came on the television. A few I rented from the local video store. Ferrara began his career with ultra low budget flicks like 'the driller killer' and 'ms 45'. The movies were humorous as well as being serious. In the 90s the quality of his projects improves with 'the bad lieutenant' and 'body snatchers. His movies have always been character driven as depicting the mental state of mind going in to the negative stage. He genre has always differed, so he has demonstrated that he has versatility. His movies mostly are shot in New York, just like Martin Scorsesee.This is a gangster movie. I have always been a fan of this genre and I have seen many. The plus point of this movie is that it's short, but the linear pattern of the movie somewhat feels disjointed. One scene moves to another without a certain flow. However this film does not have the ability to contend with the likes of 'scarface' and 'goodfellas. It is not a classic either, but that does not mean that one would not enjoy it. Abel has clearly demonstrated that he can make gangster movies. Though I did not have much high opinion in regards to 'the funeral'. It was dull and slow paced.*************************SPOILERS AHEAD************************** The plot centres around a crime boss that is played fantastically by Christopher Walken, who is released out of jail after doing time. He decides that he wants to start afresh and distribute his wealth and profits to the poor and needy by investing to build a hospital. He aims to accomplish this by killing his rival enemies and being the dominant in the city. However this does not prove easy as a group of cops are hellbent on taking him down. Walken's gang is eradicated after Caruso (the cop) plan an undercover operation. However Walken attempts to fight back.**********************END OF SPOILERS******************* Wesley Snipe's 'New jack city' was far more superior than this movie. It was everything that this movie was lacking. It contained everything within that king of new york did not have. It has a short paper thin plot but Walken's performance substitutes for that. After this he got many bad guy roles. There's plenty of violence for the viewer to enjoy thus the movie would be incomplete without it. The movie would have been more better if the plot was more enhanced and involved the cops more in to the story. The focus on them was lacking. The movie does have its fair share of flaws which tends to take away the true realism. For example 'does a gang boss really have to kill people himself ?', and 'why does know one get shot even at close range during the car chase on the bridge ?'. The highlight of the movie was the confrontation scene between Walken and the detective in the apartment near the end. Walken's facial expressions and emotional acting just made me feel for him.28\/8 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 October 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" When I was at University I was a fan of Abel Ferrara's movies.

That's not the case here because of Price's wonderful performance and he's so good that you really don't care how silly the story is because he makes you believe in what you're seeing. I love the way Price delivers his line with the best example coming when he's trying to get his wife to sign over some cash to her sister. Another memorable sequence is Price's LSD trip, which was a first for mainstream cinema. We also have the famous death sequence, which had a few color scenes added to it. These scenes still remain rather effective, which is just more credit for the director. The supporting players deliver some nice performances but there's no question that the film belongs to Price.

The leader of this operation is Lord Dark Helmet played by Rick Moranis who has all the best moments.Where to begin? Well, the cast is great (Dick Van Patten, Mel Brooks, John Candy, and John Hurt just to name a few), the special effects are those grand old school effects, and the comedy is both laugh out loud and subtle. A particular favorite of mine is the ludicrous speed scene.

They generally believe they can get by on suspense, intrigue and our inherent and insatiable need to find out 'whodunit.' But Se7en is a philosophical thriller that addresses a much bigger part of our nature - the age old question of whether or not humans are inherently evil. As gripping as it is the way it turns gears in your head in search of any way to get mentally one step ahead of the plot, Se7en is a first-rate crime thriller because of the ideas fueling the story and a director in David Fincher who perfectly understands them.More than a story of two detectives on the trail of a serial killer committing murders based on the seven deadly sins, Se7en wants to be something bigger. It wants you to take a breather from figuring it out and chew on something a little more sophisticated, like say, human nature. The contemplative script by Andrew Kevin Walker gives us plenty of time for this as retiring Lt. Somerset (Freeman) and Det. Mills (Pitt) bicker over the killer's motives together or even have dinner at Mills' apartment. It's not just about the mystery and what psychology or ideals drive the killer -- those ideas echo throughout the film and even in these basic conversational scenes.None of that would be communicated well, however, without Fincher (Alien 3). Se7en takes place in an unnamed rundown city, presumably in modern day, and that locational flexibility allows Fincher and whoever scouted locations the ability to film the movie in places that would better tell this story about human nature. The murder scenes take place in seedy, decrepit apartments -- all usually dark -- in attempt to tell a story of humanity in its darkest place, at it's very worst. Constant use of on-screen lights (e.g characters holding flashlights, red lamps, etc) give the film its signature while also extending the metaphor. It's the work of a director who understands the script through and through and has command of his vision.The characters are also extremely sophisticated and believable as are the performances of the actors playing them. Freeman comes fresh off his Oscar-winning performance in The Shawshank Redemption and absolutely dominates the pacing of the film. We take our cues on when to relax, when to get more curious and when to get passionate from his performance. On the verge of retirement, we see perfectly how this one life-changing case challenges his hardened world view.Even Pitt's Mills, in his impatience, naivety and quick-tempered rebellious perspective, goes quickly from characteristics that feel a little forced to monumentally epiphanic near the climax. Pitt's taken on numerous roles in his career where we think we're getting the shells of a character role but we end up getting something meaningful after all.That's sort of the way Se7en works on the whole. Before you can even realize it, you suddenly realize you've been watching a thoughtful two-hour sermon about mankind's true nature and its inclination toward evil with a large order of murder mystery on the side. Few thrillers give us the pleasure of meditating on such important ideas, in this case a question at the center of philosophy for hundreds if not thousands of years. ~Steven CVisit my site at http\/\/moviemusereviews.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"4 October 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Murder mysteries don't often indulge their audience's intellectual capacity.
