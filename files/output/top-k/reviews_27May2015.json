Edward is an outcast because he has had to live his life with scissors for hands after his inventor died before he can finish his creator. Edward is taken in and cared for by a kind woman and falls for her pretty daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). However, things prove tough for Edward as he has to try and deal with disapproving neighbours and Kim's rather aggressive boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall).Burton's primary objective here was to tell the story of a man who may be a bit scary and weird on the outside, but ultimately show that underneath his rather scary exterior is a man who is kind and gentle. Yes it's a little clichéd and mushy perhaps, but I think it's something that writers can get away with if a film has a certain charm and warmth to it and that's where a film like Edward Scissorhands really succeeds.Another interesting facet with this film is that it acts as a satire\/social commentary on suburban life; I must admit that I found it amusing to watch these shallow and dull 'suburban housewives' all chatting on the phone about Edward's arrival and to here them gossiping about their neighbours and so on. It's a spot on critique about modern suburban life that was both clever and funny.Edward Scissorhands is awash with beautiful colours and wonderful cinematography; not only does this film have oodles of charm and heart, but it's also quite pretty to look at as well (and it's not just the cinematography that's pretty - Winona Ryder scrubs up quite well too).As far as performances go then this is Depp's film hands down; he captures both the innocence and naivety of Edward in such a way that it's almost impossible not to care about him as a character. Anthony Michael Hall was surprisingly effective in his role as a thug (I've only seen him play the geek before and must admit that I think he's better playing a geek than a thug, but he was still good here).If I'm being critical then there are one or two weaknesses with this picture; firstly I felt that this film could have benefited from a little more character development (the suburban housewives were quite funny at first, but I do believe that they out stayed their welcome and towards the end they were becoming more annoying than funny). I felt that Burton could have perhaps developed Edward's character a bit more as I couldn't help but feel that he only scratched the surface with his original and impressive creation.To be honest though when a film has this much charm, this much warmth and this much likability it's hard to really put it down. It's pretty to look at, it has a nice story and it contains some fine acting performances. It's a very difficult film not to like so just sit back and enjoy!!

This movie is horrible, worst Batman movie ever! Everyone with the exception of Michael Gough (Alfred) and Pat Hingle (Gordon) are miscast in this movie. Arnold took a huge step backwards from the last villain he portrayed, to play this guy who cracks so many puns it's quite more painful than circumcision. George Clooney isn't Batman, he's himself in a bat suit complete with bat nipples. Playing Batman is a tough job and he didn't try, you need to play three characters but he played himself in all three parts. 1. Bruce Wayne the playboy billionaire 2. Bruce Wayne as he is alone 3. Bruce Wayne as Batman. On a side note, I like the aforementioned actors, Arnold has starred in great action flicks like the Terminator series, Totall Recall, and Predator. George Clooney is a great actor, I don't blame him for this disaster, he's even publicly apologized for this movie and so did director Joel Schumacher.This really isn't a movie, it's a two hour long toy commercial with sloppy acting, sets that look like they were made for toy commercials, and way too many supporting characters and subplots nobody cares about. I swear the writers were drunk when they wrote the script when it came down to Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy's plan, yeah they teamed up. Freeze plans to freeze Gotham and then the WORLD! Ivy then plans to repopulate the planet with new plants, anyone with a brain would know PLANTS CAN'T GROW ON ICE! Let's talk about Robin played by Chris O''Donnell, he's a spoiled brat and I want him to freeze to death, enough said. Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) is way over the top and she comes off as sex symbol acting like a porn star with a plant fetish. Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) is the most shoehorned character ever, how she became Batgirl makes no sense. There's suspension of disbelief, but in this movie try suspension of insanity. Bane, no just no. Bane is not a brainless brute who growls gibberish, he's supposed to be intelligent, here he's a blithering idiot. Wow, you guys messed up big time!It's difficult to talk about the plot because as I said, there are way too many subplots.

The movie had no clue what it was talking about, you hear these people say stuff and you think to yourself What?.

If you enjoy tension and horror in the slightest go and see it, 'cause you will probably love it. It's one of those very special and fearsomely distinctive kinds of horror movies from yesteryear that has the rare enduring charm and quality about it that just more than stands the test of time. I suppose it's a simple and straightforward enough tale of fear, distrust, and most importantly twisted alien abominations, and how they slowly but surely invade and infect the desperate souls who are trapped in a place where none of them can hope to escape or even call for help, which of course just raises the despair and unease to new levels. This group of essentially doomed men must try and prevent the end of the world, provided they can figure out who to trust and who is still human before it's too late... Damn if it isn't so near-perfectly made, everything about it is handled so well and works out so beautifully. The starkly freezing visuals and cinematography is suffused with fear and unseen menace, with the early point in the film where they visit the grim charred remains of the Norwegian camp being especially nightmarish and creepy because unbeknownst to them, that's what's lying ahead. It just draws you right in and makes you almost feel like your in their shoes, and that's one of the things that I think a worthwhile horror picture is meant to do, it immerses you in the environment of what you're watching. I like how the cast are all interesting guys who are different from one another, and while they're not super-developed or anything you definitely care about them enough that you fully share their horror at what's befalling them. I really like the performance of the dog in the opening act which isn't all that it seems, you get a very sinister vibe from it, it doesn't look like your average plain old happy dumb dog, it looks like it's thinking and waiting for something. Way to go dog.. Never looks at the camera once! I don't believe that you can truly love this film without enjoying all the aspects of it, some love it for all the psychological atmosphere, whereas myself I lean more towards the monsterfest splatter side of things(!). But the creature appearances and the mood play off each other, every build-up is paid off, and when the Thing does explode out of nowhere when you're least expecting it, it's really the cherry on the top. I'd put my money on it as the scariest monster ever, I mean what's more alarming than the terror of your own body and mind being stolen and corrupted from within and turned against you? The horrific concept of the parasite taking over is truly used to its fullest potential. As a creature, I see the overall entity of the Thing as a giant all-consuming mouth, with each separate organism a tooth, and all that they can really do is to see how long they can, stem the jaw... The complete carnage of the monster attacks is violent and revolting, but also so undeniably fascinating that you just can't look away, it's like madness given form... My favourite is the sideways snappy-head because the legendary build up to it with the blood test is so perfectly nail-biting to me every time. The moment is so hectic that it's almost absurdly comedic, the way poor frightened Windows has his head thoroughly chewed on before being spat out! It's a picture that really shows what could be done with the technique of practical effects.

John Carpenter may not have technically created the idea of the Thing, but it's because of this movie and his awesome vision why people recognise it to this day, it was him that breathed life into it and gave it an enduring(many!) face and identity.

The photography and sets are just stunningly well done; the attention to detail that was Stanley Kubrick. My review is a philosophical review. I must say, as just a straight narrative, the picture is very interesting and well done. You do not have to grasp the ideas I am talking about to enjoy a very intriguing, straight forward adventure picture. The going out into the world to find my place archetype shorn of all the Kubrickian's themes serves the movie sufficiently to make it worth owning. Kubrick's main goal is always to expose human irrationality how the surface, seemingly rational facade, is but a thin patina covering an utterly irrational savage. HAL goes nuts trying to reconcile the two opposing directives of his designers perfect information processing and imitate humans as much as possible. Well, humans are complete mendacity always prevaricating mostly to hide from themselves their true natures. Here the template is human ambition. Redmond gets a hankering to climb the social ladder after some interesting misadventures. Through laborious, painstaking, immoral deceit and ruthlessness, he supplants the previous Lord of Lyndon; he gets the noble wife but no title. His ruthless mother gets behind him with a whip and a chair pushing him for that title he must have. He then is forced to chase all these nobles all around throwing money and galas for every blue blood for miles. The first thing to notice is how unhappy Redmond is when he attains his earthly Nirvana. The look on both of them; how utterly bored with all the endless work that goes with being rich and owning all those possessions. The constant status games to own the right paintings, know the right people. What a crushing bore? Again, Kubrick wants you to see how completely crazy to desire and fight to achieve misery. Like Schopenhauer points out, human life is a pendulum between desire for the poor and boredom for the rich. Misery is the usual outcome. The poor, like naive Liza, in My Fair Lady crooning how,''wouldn't it be lovely, to be rich; no, it is a massive amount of work, worry and boredom.Schopenhauer points out how the rich own so many homes so that at least all the travel will consume all that boredom. Kubrick shows you the stack of bills, the huge staff, the entourage that goes with you everywhere. I love the scene where Redmond is just staring blankly, in boredom, as Lady Lyndon signs the mountain of checks. The other major theme is that the skills requisite for ruthlessly grabbing the wealth are the very ones that destroy Redmond. When he is just about to ooze his way, at a music recital, into that coveted title; Lord Bullington provokes him, the old Redmond, the violent usurper, attacks and beats him. Well, there goes the title. It is a beautiful masterpiece another illustration of the utter insanity within human beings that will lead to their self annihilation in Dr. Strangelove. However he strays, Stanley always returns to this theme humans live totally in the dark about their irrationality and their violence. I think this is a real work of art.

However upon repeated viewings I rate it as good as the first movie, just because it surprisingly does have a lot to offer the franchise in terms of style and pacing. Unfortunately production began with sadness, as the series producer Byron Kennedy died in a helicopter crash in 1983 whilst location shooting. Director George Miller was somewhat obviously distraught and reluctant to continue, thus leading to the employment of George Ogilvie (Whom Miller worked with prior) as a Co-Director.Set 15 years after the events of The Road Warrior, Max (Mel Gibson) is now navigating the wasteland by a camel-drawn wagon. It is eventually stolen and the trail of the thief leads him to Bartertown, a seedy community ran by the somewhat eccentric Aunt Entity (Tina Turner). As Max soon learns things are not all as they seem, his exploits in the towns gladiatorial arena The Thunderdome eventually leads to exile, discovery and redemption.Probably the most campiest of the series, and considering everything we've seen so far that is saying something. Mad Max 3 definitely is a lot more kid focused in this outing, but the style is delightfully exaggerated given that the budget (12 million Australian dollars) was the highest the series had seen yet. Unfortunately the car chases have taken a back seat this time around, therefore the other action sequences do a somewhat decent job making up for it. The Thunderdome itself remains unique and exciting, maybe in the future we too will suspend weaponry on the roof of our cage fights (One can dream). Mel Gibson is still a strong leading man, but Tina Turner's hammy performance steals the show and she easily holds her own as one of the most memorable characters of the series. Sadly series composer Brian May doesn't return this time around, then again is it actually possible to go wrong with Maurice Jarre (The man responsible for the music of Eyes Without A Face, and Lawrence Of Arabia)? Either way the soundtrack does the job, but Tina Turner steals the show blaring out her songs over the opening and closing credits (We Don't Need Another Hero would go on to be one of her biggest hits).Final Verdict Fans have openly criticised Beyond Thunderdome for being more obviously Hollywood-ized then the previous outings, but I think there remains just enough here to not label it as the black sheep of the franchise. Though a light, Peter Pan-esque tone certainly doesn't suit a series originally inspired by car accidents and high speed chases, there is enough here I remember fondly to keep me coming back. Essentially it's like an old episode of TV's Batman (1966), it's rusty but there's a certain charm reflecting back on it. 7\/10.

Now free after twenty years, he wanders back into a town that regards him at first with suspicion, even though few remember his crime.You can hardly blame the good folks of Dogpatch. They're mostly polite, earnest, God-fearing sons of the soil, while Thornton has a closely shaven head, a chin that is so far jutted out that it almost defies gravity, and a maniacal smile fixed to his face. On top of that, he speaks in a voice like that of someone gargling pebbles and he ends his utterance with a lunatic Mmm-HMMM. He doesn't walk so much as creep, and he rarely looks people in the eye.A stunner of a performance in a film that nicely captures the veneer of politesse and generosity that masks the wellsprings of violence in a small Southern town.I don't think I'll describe too much of the plot. The movie is overlong and the screenplay puts Thornton in the middle of all the rituals and intrigues of small town society. He gets to meet his estranged father, he gets baptized, he gets to meet a slow salesgirl at the local Dollar Store, he serves as a surrogate father to a young boy.The ending is a bit abrupt, as if the screenwriter couldn't think of a truly satisfying ending. As it is, it's a big improvement over Thornton's falling in love with the retarded salesgirl and living happily ever after in a rose-covered cottage. Nobody weeps. There is little sentimentality on display. Only once does the closed-mouthed Thornton begin to spout what sound a little too much like folk poetry. Thet there boy lives in his hort and there ain't much room in there fer him. We know fairly soon who's good and who's bad. That's rather a weakness. Yet there really IS only one bad guy, Dwight Yoakam, the singer, who gives a scary performance as the abusive, hateful suitor who disliked whimpering kids and retards. Of course, when he's bad, he's very, very bad, but he tries to be good, really he does. And he features in a comic scene in which he gets his cowboy band together and they play the lousiest music that ever assailed the human ear, and later argue about which of their works is most poetic.Some of the film could have been condensed. Thornton doesn't make it with the salesgirl. Okay. It takes ten minutes to establish that in the film. It could have been dealt with in one or two. The baptism doesn't signal any change in Thornton's character. It just pads the film out and renders it sluggish, like the muddy stream in which the born again are dunked. I suspect the scenes were ornamental enactments of Billy Bob Thornton's childhood memories of Arkansas. He must have thought them sensitive and evocative but, as the obscure writer said, Kill all your darlings.
