As a film that has had much acclaim I was already familiar with its storyline and some musical numbers, although having never seen it. I had high hopes. I love a good musical. 'West Side Story' received an outstanding eleven Academy Award nominations. It would go on to receive ten of these including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor and Actress for George Chakaris and Rita Moreno respectively, and Best Direction for the dynamic duo of Robert Wise and principle choreographer Jerome Robbins. I was expecting perfection. Perhaps it was for this reason that I was unfortunately left feeling deflated and ultimately disappointed.That being said, I do not want to let my disillusionment cloud my objectivity. The film was not all bad &#x96; there were pleasant aspects. The choreography by Robbins is sheer genius. I do not envy the gruelling efforts the cast and crew made to create this excellence. The stories of Robbins need to create perfection in every take are well known. His inability to say 'Cut!' did ultimately lead to his removal from production due to financial impracticality but his assistants proved loyal to his vision and every step we see is his. Robbins displays innovativeness far out ranking any of his contemporaries. The notable scene whereby the gangs run toward a tall chain-link fence and manoeuvres themselves barehanded upwards and over onto the playground below in one fluid motion is not only incredible to behold in the moment, but you cannot help but wonder how many times the poor actors, not stuntmen, were forced to carry out this sequence to give it it's effortlessness.I also found the retelling of 'Romeo and Juliet' itself to be utterly refreshing. I enjoyed the setting's transference from 16th Century Italy to the more familiar Upper West Side New York. The Montagues and Capulets become two rival street gangs - the second generation European immigrant Jets and the Puerto Rican Sharks struggling to find their place in the world. While I find fault with the actual names of the gangs and dub them corny, the perpetuation of the young adults as victims of racial barriers evokes empathy in the viewer and an understanding of the feud not present in Shakespeare's play due to purposeful ambiguity. The removal of the parents from the plot and the casting of a young Rita Moreno as Anita to mirror the role of the older Nurse serve to make the film more appealing for a younger audience. These simple plot devices come together to make William Shakespeare approachable and take away the impossibility of coming to terms with his extensive literary catalogue.Be all that as it may, I cannot hide my belief that this film was anti-climactic. I found the dialogue uninspired and bland. It was corny, and not in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way. As a Disney lover, I am a big fan of cheesy fairy tale romance. That being said, I cannot hide my disdain for the interchanges between the two leads Maria (Natalie Wood) and Tony (Richard Beymer). Firstly, there is a sheer lack of chemistry between the two lovers. Beymer is cripplingly insincere due to his incapability to carry the role of leading man let alone portray the role of a reformed gang leader. I am unable to find them to be a credible couple. I do not root for them. In terms of casting, on the other hand Rita Moreno's portrayal of Anita saves the show. She is utterly deserving of her Oscar. She exudes a charisma, magnetism and passion in that role that puts on display the numerous flaws of Beymer and Wood for all to see.While I can admire the bold move to rewrite Shakespeare's tragic ending of mutual suicide, I cannot help but wonder if perhaps to have had Maria shoot herself would have saved my view of the film. While this film does indulge on tragedy through violence, murder and an attempted rape, I cannot help but say I was unmoved. The film lacked the same powerful ending that 'Romeo and Juliet' has. The death of Juliet in the play is critical to the play's success. It embodies the play's message of love and intensifies its moral - intolerance creates only sorrow. I understand that it played into the character development of Maria in becoming a confident and independent woman, but I do think her death could have given the movie the strong conclusion it so desperately needs. The hint of reconciliation between the Jets and the Sharks is utterly contrived and does not do anything to add a satisfactory climax. If anything, it only serves to underline American cinema's need at the time to provide feel good cinema and a happy ending.Overall, the film's drama is nothing compared to its dancing. The leads are overshadowed by Rita Moreno. The gangs are parodies. The ending is lacklustre. It is for these reasons I would give it only three-and-a-half out of five stars. For a film with such potential and such acclaim, I truly had expected more.

I first saw it in the cinema as a child, it was then worn out on VHS tape. Played to death on DVD & is now owned on special edition Blu Ray. It is by far, one of my favourite ever movies. Everything about this movie is perfect. It is a subject which is relateable to every single person who has ever watched this film; that our toys came to life when weren't there. In Toy Story the toys don't just simply come to life, they have their own world, their own relationships, their own problems and conflicts. But above all else they have friendship, loyalty & a special togetherness. The story begins with the Toys in Andy's bedroom. It is the day of Andy's birthday party and the toys gather round anxious awaiting the news as to whether a new toy has been given as a birthday present, and if it is to be Andy's new 'favourite toy'. The toy that is handed over as a present is the brand spanking new, space ranger, Buzz Lightyear. All the other toys are all in awe of him, all toys that is, expect for Woody, Andy's current favourite Toy.

The story progresses sending the toys on an adventure which is like no other seen before!The casting for Toy Story is simply perfect. Tom Hanks & Tim Allen put in fantastic performances as Woody & Buzz. The relationship they create is so believable and they develop fantastic chemistry throughout the film. The best thing about Toy Story is the way it manages to involve you in the film. It makes you feel all of the toys emotions & really makes you feel for them. But at the end of the day they are just toys! We shouldn't get that involved yet somehow we do! Toy Story has many hidden meanings and gestures which really drive home the message of friendship and love. They are not cheesy, they are touching and realistic. This is what Disney do so well, they make children's films but whilst doing so they create them so they can be related to by adults. The animation is also on the money, this movie is almost 20 years old but looks as good today on Blu Ray as any other animation.

The leading lady, Suzanne Cloutier, was French Canadian and needed to be dubbed. The important role of Cassio was dubbed by Welles himself, the actor not being available at the time.

The film was also released six years after Halloween 5. As most hardcore fans know, the production on Halloween 6 was one of the biggest disasters in the horror genre. Splitting opinions caused a mayhem on events that lead to the theatrical version being one of the worst pieces of film in the entire franchise. The only thing that saved it was the Producer's Cut, and even that version wasn't amazing. The following is my review of Halloween 6 The Curse of Michael Myers.Daniel Farrands wrote the film and is know more recently for his work on some fantastic documentaries His work on this film will always be a point of controversy. His original screenplay for the film was apparently a very good effort, but studio heads(The Weinstein Brothers) wanted a more slasher take to the film, and thus things got twisted and turned around. The basic story of this film is that we find out more about what drives Michael Myers to kill. Basically he was called upon as a young kid to kill for a group called Thorn. The idea is a giant step in the wrong directing in my opinion, but because Halloween 5 set this up, ending this story had to be done. The story itself is very strange as we find out at the start of the film that Jamie Lloyd has died following the events of Halloween 5 in the prison escape. However, the truth is she is actually alive, and she is seen for the early part of this film. We find out later in the theatrical version just in passing that the child Jamie is carrying in the early part of the film is actually Michael's child. Yeah, very strange stuff. However, in the Producer's Cut we get a much more stern hint that the child Jamie has is in fact Michael's Child. Either way you slice the cake, the story of this film is very odd. The Producer's Cut excels in other areas which I will be getting into soon. Overall, the story itself is very odd, and certainly one of the worst of the franchise(second worst in my opinion). Farrands apparently had a good idea for the story, but it got lost in the shuffle, so I cannot really blame him for the mess that is this film.The film was directed by Joe Chappelle. Chappelle will take a good bit of the blame on this production as he was the director, but he was young and wanted to please the studio heads. The Weinstein's are the real villains behind this awful mess called Halloween 6. The Theatrical version of this film actually underwent some re-shoots because the Weinstein's wanted more gore. The Theatrical Cut of the film seems to be a Friday the 13th type rip off, instead of being a nice thrilling horror film. The Producer's Cut of the film excels in the regard of letting you use your imagination instead of overloading on the gore factor. While there is still blood, and more than the original film, it certainly doesn't compare to the mess that was the Theatrical Cut of this film. The acting is pretty bland once again as the film stars a young Paul Rudd. Sadly, this was the final Halloween film for acting legend Donald Pleasence. He sadly passed away before the film was ever released in theaters. While this wasn't exactly the best movie for him to go out on, just seeing him one last time take a strong command of the Dr. Loomis role was such a great joy to see. Halloween fans will always remember the legacy he created for himself doing a total of five of these movies, never thinking twice about it. He loved the role as much as us fans love the entire franchise. Overall, Joe Chappelle was a young director trying to become famous and he got himself into a battle that no one was going to win. The end result was a sub par film.Alan Howarth also came back for this outing, this would be his last try at the Halloween score, as the later films went a different route. The score is this film, is once again dependent on which version of the film you are watching. The score on the Theatrical Cut is bizarre at times. There is some almost heavy metal added to it, and some 1990s grunge rock added as well. While Howarth is credited for some of the bad scoring of this film, during the re-shoots for some of the scenes, Paul Rabjohns actually came in to finish off the score for Howarth. The end result was a giant mess of a score for the Theatrical Cut. The Producer's Cut however has a much more classic John Carpenter feel to it, and it really makes that version of the film so much better. Howarth deserves some blame here, but not that much,In closing this film wasn't really the best effort to end on. The Thorn storyline frankly shouldn't have even been considered, and should have never moved along as far as it did in this film. While the Theatrical Cut is a giant mess, the Producer's Cut is much more watchable even though there are still some ludicrous story lines in it. Fans of the franchise like myself will not only watch the Theatrical Version, but also watch the Producer's Cut, and while the Producer's Cut has been on bootleg version for over a decade, it has finally been released on Blu-Ray in stunning quality for everyone to finally see. It might not be the version that should have been made, but the Producer's Cut is the best version of the film that was shot.Theatrical Cut 3\/10 Producer's Cut 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 October 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The following review will contain spoilers.Halloween 6 The Curse of Michael Myers takes place six years after Halloween 5.

It might not be the version that should have been made, but the Producer's Cut is the best version of the film that was shot.Theatrical Cut 3\/10 Producer's Cut 6\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"24 October 2014","score":"","review":" Halloween 4 was a huge success, no doubt.

If this has indeed happened to you, then 1981's The Howling won't put you at ease! It all begins on the mean streets of Los Angles with local TV reporter Karen White on her way to meet a vicious serial killer named Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo) who's reached out to her. After a terrifying encounter with Eddie in a darkened room and a police shoot, you can probably see why Karen's a little strung out. So on the advice of renowned psychologist Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Macnee) she and her husband, Bill(Christopher Stone) head up to a secluded, counseling sanctuary known as the colony. All seems well at first; the people are friendly if not slightly odd to some degree but still friendly enough. But just when she's settling in for the night that's when the howling begins. Soon enough, we discover that the colony is actually a place for werewolves to get away from the civilized world and these aren't your Lon Chaney type wolves that have to wait for the moon to be full. They are the primal beasts within all of us, waiting to be unleashed onto the world. Will Karen and Bill make it out or are they destined to be victims of the howling?Directed by Joe Dante (Gremlins, Pirana) The Howling came out at a time when werewolf films were all but dead. There hadn't really been any real hits like 1941's The Wolf Man in decades and most studio heads considered the werewolf premise corny and outdated. Needless to say, The Howling forever destroyed that idea. Based off of the novel by Gary Brandner, the story strips away all talk of the full moon belief (Which was never part of the original werewolf lore to begin with. The whole notion of the full moon was created by Curt Siodmak when he wrote the screenplay to 1941's The Wolf Man) and instead presents the werewolves as simply shape shifters who have a craving for blood every now and then. This makes them more evil and powerful since there are no limitations to where and when they can transform. All of this is directed masterfully by Dante, who is able to create a spooky and foreboding atmosphere and for a second make you believe that all talk of beasts in the night may not sound so ridiculous after all. I would even go as far as to say this is his best work. The script is cleverly written to include not only horror but a few inside jokes for those who know a thing or two about werewolf flicks.And as for makeup, this isn't your grandfather's werewolf flick. For the longest time, Hollywood werewolves looked like a guy with a hairy football glued to his head (No offense to Lon Chaney and the guys at Universal). Here, the werewolves look exactly as they should; big, hairy, mean beasts from the pits of hell. Rob Bottin must be congratulated all the way for his work here, especially when it comes to Eddie's transformation sequence which has to rank as one of the best transformation sequences ever. All of the actors and actresses play their parts well, which goes a long way to making films of this type into something special. Dee Wallace proves she is by far one of the actresses when it comes to getting into character and being scared out of her mind when playing Karen. Christopher Stone should be congratulated for his role as Bill, who badly wants to help his wife but is unsure just how. Patrick Macnee of The Avengers fame is delightful to watch here as the good if not slightly unconventional doctor, as is Robert Picardo as the disturbing Eddie Quist. Rounding out the cast is the beautiful but sadly deceased Elizabeth Brooks as Marsha Quist, John Carradine, Slim Pickens, Dennis Dugan, Noble Willingham, James Murtaugh, and many more who I just don't have space for. In the end, The Howling is a everything a horror film should be Spooky, scary, unsettling, and able to stand the test of time. This film, along with An American Werewolf in London of the same year, probably saved the werewolf genre from extinction and still is one of the all time greats of its kind.

All of those elements make For A Few Dollars More a terrific film and one of my favorite movies that is Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood at their best.For A Few Dollars More tells the story of The Man With No Name(his name is Monco in this film)who is now a bounty hunter who teams up with fellow bounty hunter Colonial Douglas Mortimer(Lee Van Cleef)to take down sadistic outlaw Indio(Gian Maria Volonte)dead or alive.After the Box Office success of A Fistful Of Dollars director Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood were both asked to do a follow up and the two responded with For A Few Dollars More the second film in The Man With No Name\/Dollars trilogy and is a brilliant,thrilling and intense Western classic that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the very end and will keep you glued to the screen. Sergio Leone was given a much larger budget with than the one in Fistful and it truly shows because with For A Few Dollars More Leone expands the scope of Fistful and gives this movie a bigger and much larger canvas that is gripping and incredible with an epic style that is operatic. Where as Fistful was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Youjimbo Leone For A Few Dollars More comes up with his own story and does it in a flawless and stylish way that is pretty amazing. With each of The Man With No Name\/Dollars movies Leone's style grew and led all the way up to his masterpiece The Good,The Bad And The Ugly where Leone took the trilogy to a higher level. If A Fistful Of Dollars was about the war between two rival families then For A Few Dollars More about how life and death has a price and outlaws were brutal and vicious with violence being the only option and Leone gives us a stylish yet gritty look at the Old West. What makes FFDM so great and interesting is the teaming of The Man With No Name(Monco)with Mortimer because we see both of them are good bounty hunters by themselves but together they make a lethal combination and both want to capture Indio but for different reasons. Monco wants to capture Indio for the money where as Mortimer wants Indio for the money and personal reasons which makes Mortimer a strong and complex character. Monco and Mortimer like any duo that teams up together have clashes because both either want to do their own thing or it's because of their different personalities but the two start to respect each other. You will enjoy the relationship between the tough and gritty character Monco and Mortimer. Where as Monco and Mortimer are charming and likable antiheroes the character Indio who is the villain in the film is a horrible and vicious character who is so evil that he has no chance for redemption or to be good again because when ever kills a person Indio does it with a twisted glee that is disturbing. Every time Indio showed up on screen you feel like no one is safe from his violent wrath and you are rooting for Monco and Mortimer to catch him. Indio is a character you will never forget and is one of the most intense characters you will ever see in a Western film. While FFDM is without a doubt a classic and one of Leone and Eastwood's best the movie is often seen as the weakest film in the trilogy. I guess the reason some people say that is because it's not as groundbreaking as A Fistful Of Dollars or as epic and sprawling like The Good,The Bad And The Ugly or the story is isn't strong. In my opinion the story in FFDM is strong and had enough greatness the keep viewers entertained. The Action and gunfights in FFDM are truly thrilling and are done with white hot tension and suspense that never quits. The ending in For A Few Dollars More is outstanding and a classic finale filled Action,explosive moments and surprises. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Clint Eastwood is excellent once again as The Man With No Name(Monco)with Eastwood commanding the screen. Lee Van Cleef is brilliant as Colonial Douglas Mortimer and has great chemistry with Eastwood. Gian Maria Volonte is amazing and intense as Indio a sadistic outlaw. Mario Brega(Nino),Luigi Pistilli(Groggy)and Klaus Kinski(Juan Wild)give good performances as well.The direction by Sergio Leone is fantastic and stylish with Leone always moving the camera using close-ups,zooms and creative visual style. Amazing direction,Leone.The score by Ennio Morricone is dazzling,haunting and epic and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Another great score,Morricone.In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Clint Eastwood,Westerns or films in general,I highly suggest you see For A Few Dollars More,one of the greatest Westerns ever made and an excellent,unforgettable classic that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.

All of those elements make For A Few Dollars More a terrific film and one of my favorite movies that is Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood at their best.For A Few Dollars More tells the story of The Man With No Name(his name is Monco in this film)who is now a bounty hunter who teams up with fellow bounty hunter Colonial Douglas Mortimer(Lee Van Cleef)to take down sadistic outlaw Indio(Gian Maria Volonte)dead or alive.After the Box Office success of A Fistful Of Dollars director Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood were both asked to do a follow up and the two responded with For A Few Dollars More the second film in The Man With No Name\/Dollars trilogy and is a brilliant,thrilling and intense Western classic that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the very end and will keep you glued to the screen. Sergio Leone was given a much larger budget with than the one in Fistful and it truly shows because with For A Few Dollars More Leone expands the scope of Fistful and gives this movie a bigger and much larger canvas that is gripping and incredible with an epic style that is operatic. Where as Fistful was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Youjimbo Leone For A Few Dollars More comes up with his own story and does it in a flawless and stylish way that is pretty amazing. With each of The Man With No Name\/Dollars movies Leone's style grew and led all the way up to his masterpiece The Good,The Bad And The Ugly where Leone took the trilogy to a higher level. If A Fistful Of Dollars was about the war between two rival families then For A Few Dollars More about how life and death has a price and outlaws were brutal and vicious with violence being the only option and Leone gives us a stylish yet gritty look at the Old West. What makes FFDM so great and interesting is the teaming of The Man With No Name(Monco)with Mortimer because we see both of them are good bounty hunters by themselves but together they make a lethal combination and both want to capture Indio but for different reasons. Monco wants to capture Indio for the money where as Mortimer wants Indio for the money and personal reasons which makes Mortimer a strong and complex character. Monco and Mortimer like any duo that teams up together have clashes because both either want to do their own thing or it's because of their different personalities but the two start to respect each other. You will enjoy the relationship between the tough and gritty character Monco and Mortimer. Where as Monco and Mortimer are charming and likable antiheroes the character Indio who is the villain in the film is a horrible and vicious character who is so evil that he has no chance for redemption or to be good again because when ever kills a person Indio does it with a twisted glee that is disturbing. Every time Indio showed up on screen you feel like no one is safe from his violent wrath and you are rooting for Monco and Mortimer to catch him. Indio is a character you will never forget and is one of the most intense characters you will ever see in a Western film. While FFDM is without a doubt a classic and one of Leone and Eastwood's best the movie is often seen as the weakest film in the trilogy. I guess the reason some people say that is because it's not as groundbreaking as A Fistful Of Dollars or as epic and sprawling like The Good,The Bad And The Ugly or the story is isn't strong. In my opinion the story in FFDM is strong and had enough greatness the keep viewers entertained. The Action and gunfights in FFDM are truly thrilling and are done with white hot tension and suspense that never quits. The ending in For A Few Dollars More is outstanding and a classic finale filled Action,explosive moments and surprises. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Clint Eastwood is excellent once again as The Man With No Name(Monco)with Eastwood commanding the screen. Lee Van Cleef is brilliant as Colonial Douglas Mortimer and has great chemistry with Eastwood. Gian Maria Volonte is amazing and intense as Indio a sadistic outlaw. Mario Brega(Nino),Luigi Pistilli(Groggy)and Klaus Kinski(Juan Wild)give good performances as well.The direction by Sergio Leone is fantastic and stylish with Leone always moving the camera using close-ups,zooms and creative visual style.

The story occurs in the United States, during now days. The main character who's played by Edward Norton is a pathetic guy who's working for an insurance company, what makes him insomniac, so he tries to find a way to sleep and his solution is going to meeting like alcoholic anonymous, or a meeting with people suffering from testicles cancer. In these meetings he meets Maria Singer, she is a woman that is totally disturbed, neurotic, and incredibly funny in her own way but we must say that this character is awesome due to the fact that she is played by the amazing Helena Bonham Carter, who's for me one of the best actresses from all time. The Double of Edward Norton Character in the movie is incredibly well played by Brad Pitt. This movie will be remembered in the future such as pulp fiction or the godfather are remembered now days. This is a masterpiece in the field of cinema. Despite the quite violent aspect of the movie it is a funny movie in some part. So if I could advise you a movie this one would obviously come to my mind.

Who would have thought, especially in todays day and age of loud noise = scary, that would work? But it does. Session 9 really gets in your head, and that's exactly how it scares you.Session 9 is about a asbestos cleaning crew who goes into an abandoned insane asylum. That's when things start getting weird, and you begin to wonder who in their group is trustworthy. You are constantly getting new little clues and hints, all telling you that something isn't right, but you're not sure what. As I said before, there is basically no jump scares, so all of the horror is about visuals, sounds, and atmosphere. It gets pretty creepy, and there are some really visually scary things, such as the hallways of lights scene. It's just really freaky.The film is clearly shot on some kind of digital camera, and it kind of gives it a cheap look. I have to give them credit, because occasionally they capture some nice shots, but overall it does look kinda cheap. Another gripe I have with the film is that the resolution is slightly unoriginal. It feels like you've seen it before, even if you are a little surprised. This film is more impressive when you look at how it was executed, rather than the main plot itself. It's a really eerie and scary film, and will most certainly get into your head when watching it. I'm sure you will be spooked if you watch it all alone and in the dark.
