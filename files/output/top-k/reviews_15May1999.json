[{"date":"15 May 1999","score":"","review":"  Choices- this is what distinguishes Election from the spate of teen comedies and failed satires to which it has been compared.Unlike the majority of films today, Election hasn't been homogenized to make it more palatable to general audiences.  This isn't a high school in the vein of 90210, the actors wouldn't make it in Tommy Hilfiger ads. Shot almost entirely on location, it appears that almost nothing was changed- no repainting, building or reimagining of the buildings, no designer outfits for the actresses, no extras from central casting.Alexander Payne carefully injects the venom of the script, employing a smattering of techniques  aspect ratio, stock footage, freeze-frames, titles, split-screen, camera angles and framing.  The narration, intermittent and from several characters, is the most effective in a movie since Badlands, serving as ironic commentary (as opposed to unnecessary summation  ie, Gattica).  Thanks to these elements- and owing a debt to some superb editing -the film's multiple points of view enhance rather than detract.Election is more than a great high school comedy, though- it's an indictment of hypocrisy as lived out by middle America.  None of the characters are fully conscious of the consequences of their actions, and they all pay a price for being so oblivious.But something about the movie, brilliant as it is, troubles me.  While it does retain sympathy for its characters, my suspicion is that the audience is permitted to feel superior to them.  Election seems to be a confirmation of, not a challenge to, common perception and stereotype.  Waiting for Guffman, another brilliant film, gave me the same feeling, Both movies produce in their audiences laughter derisive and, ultimately, dismissive of their characters.Still, not since Guffman can I remember being so wonderfully uncomfortable at the movies.  Election is, at once, terrifically shrewd, splendidly funny, eerily sad.
