Invited over to his girlfriends (Charlotte Stewart) house Henry is told by her mother (Jeanne Bates) that her daughter has given birth to his child, she expects the two married very soon & the baby to be picked up from the hospital. Henry discovers that his baby is a mutant that screams constantly, the constant noise & pressure gets to Henry's girlfriend she leaves him & the baby to go back home to live with her parents. Left alone with his wailing baby in his cramped little apartment life & fatherhood becomes almost unbearable for Henry...Written, produced & directed by David Lynch who also gets production designer, sound effects, special effects, editing & original music credits many consider Eraserhead as some sort of classic, some sort of modern surreal masterpiece oozing with metaphors & deep symbolism but I really can't see where those opinions come from. Eraserhead is the sort of film that really does defy description or categorisation as it's one of a kind, not meant as a typical straight forward film with a linear story that can be understood easily Eraserhead is hard to interpret & seems like one long surreal dream full of symbols & metaphors for everyday life & it's the way you subconsciously interpret these images & metaphors that will ultimately decide how much you get from Eraserhead. Unfortunately for me I just thought Eraserhead was a random collection of seemingly unconnected weirdness that never came together in any meaningful way & if I have to think about the meaning or message of a film or even something as basic as what's it's about then the artsy symbolism & surrealist nonsense has probably gone over my head & as a whole the film wasn't obviously for me. For a film like Eraserhead to work you need to associate the surrealism & metaphors with something tangible & I didn't, I just thought Eraserhead was a mess of scenes & images that overall meant nothing to me.Maybe the single biggest cult film of all time Eraserhead is definitely worthy of it's notoriety, filmed in black and white with barely any dialogue & nothing in the way of standard narrative for an audience to grip onto Eraserhead isn't an easy watch. From piles of dirt on Henry's dresser to a bizarre scene where an old woman starts singing & dancing while giant sperm rain down which she them tramples to when Henry's head falls off & is replaced by his mutant babies to a general weirdness & unease that the not quite right normality it has. Apparently shot over five years as & when first time director Lynch got some money Eraserhead is amazingly well made considering it's low budget with a really crisp & clean look about it, sure it's weird but it's also stylish & nice to look at. Two years into filming original cinematographer Herbert Cardwell died in his sleep & was replaced by Frederick Elmes for the rest of the shoot.Shot on a budget of about $20,000 Eraserhead is incredibly well made with great special effects & some mildly gross-out scenes of mutant babies, decapitated heads & giant sperm. The acting is pretty good & quite intense although there's barely any dialogue & the character's are never fleshed out.Eraserhead is hailed as some sort of cult classic that I admit just went over my head, I thought it was a boring mess of a film with scenes of surrealist weirdness that to me didn't mean anything.

I don't know much about the creation of this film, nor about its source material, but I don't feel especially compelled to. The Fox and the Hound features moments that try to attain the kind of drama of Disney's very earliest work, but by the end comes off as little more than a retread of past Disney films with much weaker animation and less compelling characters, despite some psychological content that might have held potential for more mature storytelling.Structurally, this thing is a straight lift of Bambi. The first half details Tod the Fox and his days as a child learning the ways of the world. Interestingly, the film kicks off with a surprisingly dark tone, killing off the mother in the first scene and leaving an orphaned cub to be taken in by Tweed the widow. Already, some interesting themes are introduced as we see Tod make friends with the hound pup Copper, a friendship that's clearly doomed to tragedy. Aside from the obvious forbidden friendship, there are themes of man's relationship to nature in the widow becoming a mother figure to Tod. Clearly, this was the most character driven Disney feature in a long time for Disney. Does it pay off? Nope. Mostly, the first half of The Fox and the Hound prefers to waste time with a bunch of asinine comic set-pieces in which the twosome play tricks on Chief the hound and get the Hunter all riled up for some wacky redneck gags. In between this is a lot of cloying nothing that isn't half as cute as watching Bambi stumble his way through early life. It meanders and meanders without really making much of a point other than these guys enjoy each others company. There's also some side plot about a pair of woodpeckers trying to get a worm, but it adds up to absolutely nothing and mostly serves as annoying padding.Then, like Bambi, we get the second half where Tod simultaneously discovers his sexuality and the horrors of life. This half works a bit better, with some moments of real power, but makes a fatal flaw with the relationship between Tod and Copper. Tod sends Copper on a vengeance fueled rampage against his former friend when he...gets Chief's leg broken. Now, had Chief been shown as a faithful friend and father figure to Copper, and had Tod gotten him killed (as, I believe, it was originally meant to be) this shift would have real gravitas to it. Instead, it comes off as unearned and random, totally against what we've come to know about his character. The rest of the film simply doesn't have the weight it needs because of this one fatal script flaw.Which isn't to say there aren't those moments that truly work wonders toward the end. The bear scene in particular, though rather abrupt, is fantastically animated and legitimately thrilling, a triumph for greenhorn lead animator Glen Keane. The climax, in which the Hunter compromises his pride, is legitimately powerful as an ending, and in a better context would have been truly moving. Alas...whatever moments work here, they're constantly hindered by what comes before and after.As animation, The Fox and the Hound is a real step down for the studio. Disney's newfound star, Don Bluth, stayed aboard for a time before packing his bags and walking out to start work on the vastly superior Secret of NIMH. His team's animation here reminds of their work on The Rescuers; very well done technical wizardry for pretty vapid scenes. A few of the Nine Old Men do scant work here and there, but none of it stands out. The best work is done by future star animator Glen Keane, whose bear scene has a remarkable weight and power to it, and whose Badger character is kind of fun too. Otherwise, the animation on this film is competent at best and mechanically dictated by adherence to animation principals at worst. It's a shame seeing technical elements so by-the book here. What's even more distressing is that it's still far better animated than the next Disney project, which will barely pass Saturday Morning Cartoon with more in-betweening levels.One can see the process Disney was going through. Take an old framework like the plot to Bambi and update it to fit the trend of edgier animation that was going on at the time. It's too bound by convention to be anything but a pale retread, unfortunately, and it's unsurprising that the Disney exodus took place during the making of this and The Black Cauldron. Bluth moved to his new studio to make The Secret of NIMH, a great, dark fantasy feature that accomplished everything Disney was trying to, and various others left either with him or to start their own projects.It's really a precursor to The Black Cauldron, a film that aims for the same goals to a much more prevalent and upfront manner while failing even more miserably as a film.

Who else would be suitable for him?! Chuck Norris, Rob Schneider, Jim Carrey or somebody else? Stallone was made for the role. It was like he was born to do it.Rocky and Rambo are both alike. They can take on the world themselves whether it be in the ring or in Vietnam (please excuse me if this was wrong, I haven't seen all the Rambo movies yet, just part one). Sylvester Stallone kicks ass with the right roles with the exception of Judge Dredd.

You've seen them again and again. A few of you may even remember when many first came out, or when you first rented them on video when you were in junior hell school. I'm sure a few of you even lived through your own personal '80s horror film (Topsiders w\/ no socks, flat-tops, Vuarnet, Kajagoogoo cassettes, etc.) And how many times did you watch Evil Dead II, The Lost Boys, Fright Night, Return of the Living Dead, The Howling, Re-Animator? Or what about all that (yeah, I'm saying it) over-rated crap from Carpenter and Landis? Well, I bet there's one '80s horror film a few of you may not have seen; back in the day, it slipped right in between Fright Night and Evil Dead II. Its name is Night of the Creeps, and no joke, it's the best of its kind.The complete brainchild of one Fred Dekker, (someone give this man millions to make more movies&#x85; please!) Night of the Creeps creates a perfect balance between the pseudo- escapist, xenophobic scare-fare of the 1950s (i.e. The Blob, It Came From Outer Space, It! The Terror From Beyond Space, etc.) and the in-your-face splatter-gore of the 1980s. Hence the film itself begins in the '50s&#x85;1959 to be exact, and something mysterious has crashed down to our peaceful Earth. Investigated by a hearty frat member, he pays a nasty price for his snooping, becoming impregnated\/infected by something long, black and slithery&#x85;hot! Oh yeah &#x96; subplot &#x96; his girlfriend, who was left in the car, gets hacked to bits by an asylum escapee. Forced cryogenic entrapment helps secure the pristine Eisenhower-world from alien apocalypse. Fast-forward to 1986, and two frat-wannabe geeks, quite homely I might add, are trying to impress the hot girl on campus. They find themselves agreeing to steal a corpse in order to get into her boyfriend's fraternity, thereby impressing the young lovely. Of course, said corpse ends up not being a corpse at all, but the iced-stiff jock from the prologue, which comes back alive and begins to infect the whole campus. You see, that something long, black and slithery was in fact a parasitic brain-eating slug that turns its host into a killer zombie. Once the slugs are done feeding and gestating, the zombie head will explode sending forth scores of more newborn slugs, that all have one purpose &#x96; find a mouth. Hmmm&#x85;sounds like a few dates I've been on.No one in Night of the Creeps gives a half-assed performance either. I tip my hat to the delightful Jill Whitlow, who plays the girl-to-impress, Cynthia Cronenberg. Cynthia's the kind of girl we all want to have at our side when we're fighting aliens, not afraid to get a little dirty, which I imagine is the kind of girl a lot us want for other reasons as well. Also impressive is Tom Atkins as Detective thrill me Cameron (hubba-hubba), who has a personal score to settle connected to the aliens (see 'subplot' above). The script is one of the smartest of its genre, giving respectful nods to all its influences (pay attention to everyone's last names), and creating some genuinely wonderful and original dialogue in its own right. The editing is as tight as can be, allowing this film to be just as enjoyable after the thirtieth viewing as it is during the first. And the special effects are still excellent, proving that the passing of time is no lazy, fallback excuse for more recent films whose own CG-effects now look bland or campy.Few carnage-ridden films are as fun and stylish as this, and in every frame you can tell that Fred Dekker truly loves what he does. So sell all your copies of Carpenter and Landis movies, and send the money to Mr. Dekker. Then get yourself a copy of Night of the Creeps and celebrate the gruesome deaths of many-a-jock, and be witness to perhaps the last, great unheralded horror film of the 1980s.

It is not spectacular, and is not so far removed from reality that the viewer knows absolutely that he or she is watching a movie. Movies made after 1980, but not all, abound so much in camera work and effects and video acuity that the dialogue becomes facsimile. Another very famous movie Hopper starred in is an example of reality in cinema that still becomes a realistic phantasmagoria in Southeast Asia. That, of course being Apocalypse Now. I don't watch horror so I cannot comment on Texas Chainsaw Massacre(but I might). Commentary is all this essay really is, yet much has been said and will continue to be said about Easy Rider. I say Easy Rider has no personality because the film is actually a documentary, in most ways. The footage of everything that goes on in this classic is the telling of a journey, and that is all. It's been called the essence of the 60's more times than the fans took something at Yasgur's farm. Everyone at Woodstock did not trip or get drunk, but those times were ending, the end of a decade. That jam was at the very end of the 1960's and Easy Rider was made at the very same time. Easy Rider was a Columbia movie, directed and produced by the two main actors in it. But why I say the movie was less a motion picture is that the actors were so, so natural. It was like a documentary, but from the inside instead of the outside. The screenplay does not serve to be entertaining, or to shock, or to cause the viewer to judge. The lines, the filming, all that just is. No point is being made. The commune is viewed by Hopper and Fonda(as director and producer) honestly and openly. The relationships between everyone who lived there are as if seen in a documentary with no narrative. It is not like watching a National Geographic show where the meerkats interact and play and then Hopper chops up the whole herd with a chain saw. Like a bushwhacker. No one at the commune in Easy Rider seems to be in a hurry, and it appears that they are living on and with the land. The story of Captain America and Billy is quite different. The commune is a stop along the way, and so is another less enchanting place where they meet Jack Nicholson. Billy is throughout the movie the type who believes in living for the minute, and ironically Billy is a worrier, a whiner, and a complainer. Captain America is quite a different kind of person, a thinker, a planner, a guy with a clear head. Even though they are both criminals headed for a first hearing and beyond, Captain America is soft-spoken, thoughtful, and really considerate, especially on their first stop at a charitable farmer's place. As the two bikers continue their odyssey(the viewer's)Karen Black later enters the picture with her stirring and provocative eyes, and the movie begins taking on a more psychedelic quality at that point.

Along with his early childhood role in The Goonies and later on as Sam from The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Astin has put on a resume that spans over 25 years in the movie industry. It's a shame he's been overlooked over the years, by lesser talents like Corey Feldman and Haley Joel Osement. This guy has showcased he has charm and talent which goes together like fish and chips. Charles Dutton provides a stimulating performance as the gruff but kindhearted groundskeeper. Dutton prevents his role from being a throwback role by making it a pivotal supporting role. The musical score is something to get the party going. Sure it gets repetitive at times, it succeeds in keeping the spirit of this film alive. Sure it can be overlooked by other classic sports movies like Rocky or Raging Bull, but Rudy is right up there with the big guns.

AHX knows this, so advances a paper thin plot with any number of ludicrous clichés, cardboard characters and dopy narrative devices. Edward Norton is no longer the Universes least convincing skinhead (stand up, Elijah Wood), but this movie stretches credibility way past breaking point.The movie doesn't actually try to analyse racism on the more subtle, insidious way in which it exists in most peoples lives. Sure, there are neo-nazi and black power groups around, but this isn't most people's experience of racist behaviour. Only at the end of the movie do we get any hint this, when we see Dereks father discussing his pejudices over the dinner table. But this is very fleeting and it doesn't really give adequate justification for why Derek decided to go down this road in the first place. The movie should have spent far more time looking responsibly at the root causes of such peoples actions and ideologies - but that isn't as easy or as sensationalist as portraying all racists as maniacal cult-heads or separationists. The presence of characters like Stacy Keach's Manson-esquire demagogue serves the questionable purpose of allowing audience members to distance themselves entirely from these kinds of beleifs. Most people I think struggle to some degree with inherited prejudices as a result of ethnicity, class, geography, economic status etc, but films like this pander to our solipsistic view of ourselves as utterly non-judgemental by suggesting that racism only occurs amongst the lunatic fringe.Additionally Tony Kaye more or less disowned the finished product, claiming that Edward Norton used his star clout to have the film re-edited so that it was more to his liking.

It has a number of distinctive elements that make it transcend mere romance, though.Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander play two guardian angels who oversee much of the actions and thoughts going on in the divided city (the film was made in 1987). These two actors are excellent. Ganz and Sander had worked together as actors for 20 years before this film was made, and their camaraderie is obvious. Much of the film was shot in black and white by Henri Alekan, who did the cinematography for Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast. Ganz's and Sander's roles in great part are merely watching and reacting to the streams of consciousness of Berliners, and they are masterful in passively listening with their hearts on their faces. The use of black and white brings their faces into subtle, shaded relief, mirroring their inner feelings. Cinematographer Alekan (you will notice that the trapeze artist is in Circus Alekan) was born in 1909 and died in 2001. His work here reminds me of the cinematography of Kazuo Miyagawa in Rashomon. The camera work and tracking are intricate without ever being obvious, bringing focus on the actors and their faces.The score is by Jurgen Knieper. He wrote an angelic score without being campy or heavy handed. The music is understated and perfect. He uses strings and a choir to make spoken words into music that fits the scenes.The frail elderly man that wanders in and out throughout the movie represents Homer, the original story teller. Homer frets about losing his touch. He's played by Curt Bois who was born in Berlin in 1901 and who had a short scene in Casablanca. This was his final role; he died in 1991. The use of Bois is bittersweet, as he was a famous actor in Berlin in the Twenties and Thirties before he was forced by the rise of the Nazis to leave the country.Wenders surprises with his juxtapositions. In black and white we see an old man in modern Berlin get into a classic Thirties car and drive down the street. Then we see a view from within the car looking out onto a color film of 1930s Berlin full of Nazis and red flags with black Swastikas in their hearts; a cut and we see black and white film of Berliners digging out of the rubble with rows of corpses lined up beside the street as we drive by in that car. Then we arrive at a movie location in modern Berlin with actors in Nazi uniforms and Peter Falk waiting for us, and we realize we've seen what the car has seen during its life. We have a sad scene of Bois as Homer wandering near the modern Berlin Wall looking for Potsdamer Platz as it was in the Twenties and Thirties, when it was the heart of Berlin and the busiest intersection in Europe. In 1987, it was a desolate wasteland of refuse and weeds, and Homer collapses into a junked chair, weary from his fruitless search.Wenders also introduces subtle tension by giving us the thoughts of characters, showing their depression or anxiety. Then Wenders puts them into positions where we have the possibility of accidents or intentional acts. Each scene is played out slowly, without dramatic music, realistically as we watch and wait to see the outcomes. It's very nicely done without melodrama or histrionics, but like the lives of quiet desperation quote we all know.The movie seems to be best known for its soaring hope - in spite of all the wars, death, and destruction, we have guardian angels looking over us. We find that the angels envy us, and Ganz's angel crosses the river and becomes human, reveling in the human senses, seeing in color for the first time (black and white shots represent the world as seen by angels bereft of our senses), and finally finding love, the most human condition of all.Wings of Desire reminds me of a few movies. As I said earlier, Rashomon is comparable in cinematography. If you treasure the cinematographer's art, I recommend Wings of Desire and of course Beauty and the Beast. I was also reminded of Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451 in the scenes where people learning books walk around giving lengthy quotations as snow fell - a condition existing in Wings of Desire, as well. Finally, I have a reaction to Wings of Desire that I had to Donnie Darko I think the director left too much to the audience to fill in. There's no real story to Wings of Desire, just a series of interior monologues, which we the audience have to string together into our own coherent whole. Some people are put off by the lack of action and plot, while others take full advantage of the opportunity to vest the movie with their own plot and feelings. Wings of Desire is definitely a movie for adult contemplation.The American film City of Angels with Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan was loosely based on Wings of Desire. The two movies do not bear comparison; do not avoid Wings of Desire because you found City of Angels to be a sappy Hollywood romance.

Regardless of how many times I've seen Conan, whenever it happens to be on I have to stop and watch it, and there are not many films I can say that about. Released in 1982, Conan the Barbarian is also one of those films I remember most fondly from childhood, along with Clash of the Titans and Xanadu (tell you much?). Of course I realize that childhood probably sounds odd, considering Conan is full of nudity, sex, graphic violence, buckets of blood, etc., but my brother and I had progressive parents. Or maybe they just never bothered to actually look at the video boxes we had them rent for us? (This laissez faire attitude of my mom and dad also resulted in me seeing Blue Velvet when I was thirteen years old&#x85;not a good idea, or was it?)For many sword 'n' sandal movie lovers I've spoken to over the years, Conan the Barbarian is the film which first got them addicted as well. The never boring revenge-plot, the seemingly futile quest, the evil cult of snakes and its bare-breasted acolytes, the over- sized monster, the steamy and wanton orgy, the fierce black body-paint, the wonderful Basil Poledouris score, and my personal favorite &#x96; the scene-stealing, take-no-crap, glamazon that is Sandahl Bergman, as Valeria this all makes for a wonderfully spent two hours. And of course, the Governator. Even when first viewing it, I knew that there was something good- bad about Arnold Schwarzenegger. I didn't know what camp was yet (something very hard to believe now, like admitting there was a time I didn't know how to breathe), but I would always giggle whenever he tried to act. Apart from this, it's not hard to admit that he has a cinematic presence in Conan the Barbarian &#x96; the film that launched him as a full-fledged movie star. Arnold admitted during interviews held at the time that his favorite actor was John Wayne, and that he learned everything he knows about acting from watching Wayne's movies. Now I just viewed The Searchers again the other day, and let me tell you, sometimes I forget just how dull of an actor Duke really was. Not exactly the thespian I'd be mimicking to enhance my performance. I'm told that Conan the Barbarian is true to the original Robert E. Howard stories, if not in characterization (debatable) or plot, at least in its edge-of-your seat adventure and the overall fantastical tone. The cinematography is almost exquisite, with many scenes ostensibly shot through pale gold or russet filters &#x96; the candlelit scenes being striking as well. And the meticulous art direction is perfectly balanced between the pseudo-bizarre (the orgy scene, Thulsa's temple) and the realistic (Von Sydow's throne room, Mako's abode). Nothing is too gaudy or purposefully unreal either, like the purple or green lights that seem to come from nowhere in the typical '50s and '60s Hercules\/Goliath\/Samson films of yore, i.e. the movies of Mario Bava, or Sergio Cottofavi. Perhaps that's what makes the giant snake, and Thulsa's transformation all the more eye opening. You don't expect them to happen. The moments in the film which incorporate monsters, magic or the like are so few and far between that they truly jolt you when they occur. This dual-existence, unfortunately, is not carried into the sequel, Conan the Destroyer, which is clearly a flat-out fantasy cum monster movie, but it does have Grace Jones, whose feral performance alone warrants an essay.With the over-saturation of CGI, and our unfortunate dependence on them for the genre films of today, this movie is a wonderful chance to see what heights fantasy-loving filmmakers could reach without the aid of a computer.

Regardless of how many times I've seen Conan, whenever it happens to be on I have to stop and watch it, and there are not many films I can say that about. Released in 1982, Conan the Barbarian is also one of those films I remember most fondly from childhood, along with Clash of the Titans and Xanadu (tell you much?). Of course I realize that childhood probably sounds odd, considering Conan is full of nudity, sex, graphic violence, buckets of blood, etc., but my brother and I had progressive parents. Or maybe they just never bothered to actually look at the video boxes we had them rent for us? (This laissez faire attitude of my mom and dad also resulted in me seeing Blue Velvet when I was thirteen years old&#x85;not a good idea, or was it?)For many sword 'n' sandal movie lovers I've spoken to over the years, Conan the Barbarian is the film which first got them addicted as well. The never boring revenge-plot, the seemingly futile quest, the evil cult of snakes and its bare-breasted acolytes, the over- sized monster, the steamy and wanton orgy, the fierce black body-paint, the wonderful Basil Poledouris score, and my personal favorite &#x96; the scene-stealing, take-no-crap, glamazon that is Sandahl Bergman, as Valeria this all makes for a wonderfully spent two hours. And of course, the Governator. Even when first viewing it, I knew that there was something good- bad about Arnold Schwarzenegger. I didn't know what camp was yet (something very hard to believe now, like admitting there was a time I didn't know how to breathe), but I would always giggle whenever he tried to act. Apart from this, it's not hard to admit that he has a cinematic presence in Conan the Barbarian &#x96; the film that launched him as a full-fledged movie star. Arnold admitted during interviews held at the time that his favorite actor was John Wayne, and that he learned everything he knows about acting from watching Wayne's movies. Now I just viewed The Searchers again the other day, and let me tell you, sometimes I forget just how dull of an actor Duke really was. Not exactly the thespian I'd be mimicking to enhance my performance. I'm told that Conan the Barbarian is true to the original Robert E. Howard stories, if not in characterization (debatable) or plot, at least in its edge-of-your seat adventure and the overall fantastical tone. The cinematography is almost exquisite, with many scenes ostensibly shot through pale gold or russet filters &#x96; the candlelit scenes being striking as well. And the meticulous art direction is perfectly balanced between the pseudo-bizarre (the orgy scene, Thulsa's temple) and the realistic (Von Sydow's throne room, Mako's abode). Nothing is too gaudy or purposefully unreal either, like the purple or green lights that seem to come from nowhere in the typical '50s and '60s Hercules\/Goliath\/Samson films of yore, i.e. the movies of Mario Bava, or Sergio Cottofavi. Perhaps that's what makes the giant snake, and Thulsa's transformation all the more eye opening. You don't expect them to happen. The moments in the film which incorporate monsters, magic or the like are so few and far between that they truly jolt you when they occur. This dual-existence, unfortunately, is not carried into the sequel, Conan the Destroyer, which is clearly a flat-out fantasy cum monster movie, but it does have Grace Jones, whose feral performance alone warrants an essay.With the over-saturation of CGI, and our unfortunate dependence on them for the genre films of today, this movie is a wonderful chance to see what heights fantasy-loving filmmakers could reach without the aid of a computer.

Everyone knows he's quite the live wire comedian, so it's probably groundbreaking each time he gravitates towards more dramatic, serious fare such as Dead Poets Society and The Night Listener, with even rarer turns as negative characters, such as that in Christopher Nolan's Insomnia, and One Hour Photo.Written and directed by Mark Romanek, the film has as a central character, somebody in the background, easily forgotten, never a hero and frankly someone that we don't really care about unless we know them personally prior. Robin Williams junks his jokey side, and plays a quiet loner who works at a megamart as the one-hour photo lab tech guy who processes your photographs. Yes it's Year 2002, so cameras of the digital type were not that prevalent, and surely a film with a premise of this nature probably can no longer use this setting because it doesn't exist, at least not in a widespread manner. If you, like me, have seen the demise of this part of the photo industry, may have a tinge of sadness since you're likely to have built up some keen rapport with the person who through the development of your film, likely to have entered your personal circle of trust.And part of the brilliance of the film is how detailed it is to show how films were processed back then, from the small film roll into negatives on which photographs get printed on. William's Seymour Sy Parrish narrates this delicate process, which tells us his personality and his approach in life, chillingly meticulous and taking pride in his profession to deliver the best of his services, where memorizing facts and figures of his customers seem to be part of his edge in delivering customer service, never betraying that hint of misappropriation where he siphons off extra prints of the Yorkin family photos to feed his obsession.Working 11 years on the same job, he has seen the Yorkins - husband Will (Michael Vartan), wife Nina (Connie Nielsen) and son Jakob (Dylan Smith) grow in the community, and they soon become his family of choice, a unit that he craves for but knows he has missed the boat and can never enjoy what this family has in its ties. So the next best thing is to creepily collect mementos, and plots to be as close as he can to members of the family, stalking Nina even and trying extremely hard to connect at any level through a little bit of ingenious social engineering.A lesser story will have this degenerate into something of the Fatal Attraction kind, exploiting Sy's loneliness into something dangerous and threatening the family direct. But here's where Romanek's story succeeds in providing a breath of fresh air, where that tinge of danger becomes a suspenseful thriller, keeping us constantly wondering just what sort of edge does Sy get pushed over, and rolling his disgraceful past into the mix as well in one fell swoop, in desiring his utopia of what a family is to be maintained at that virginal level, keeping it perfect.It didn't go down the road of the mediocre or the typical, but kept things open especially in the final moments of conversation between Sy and detective Van Der Zee (Eriq La Salle), where we get the rug pulled from under our feet, yet allowing things to swing either way, depending on whether we desire to sympathize with Sy, or prefer that it be something more bleak than it already is. One thing's for sure though, with the advent of technology, the potential for something like this has moved from the photo-studio where a select few employees have privy to the photos you send for development, or this gets unwittingly revealed through the lack of securing our digital photos on social networking sites.Robin Williams is a one man tour de force, and he disappears effortlessly into the role, hidden behind the shy, lonely facade, becoming somewhat of an an eerie avenging angel type who sees his utopia being destroyed, and wants to do something about it. And the misc-en- scene gets carefully crafted to support this, from the music, sets and the spot on creation of mood that gets to crawl under your skin. His performance alone is astounding, and he totally owned the role and made this film come alive.

And though I would venture to say that nothing Kubrick ever made could be safely classified as a genre picture, The Shining is almost always, and rightfully so, listed among the top horror films of all time. But Kubrick always found a way to transcend these genres he chose to immerse himself in, whether they were noir, gladiator, (anti-)war, sci-fi, period drama, contemporary satire, etc. And out of his entire oeuvre, The Shining is perhaps the most perfect example of said transcendence, shattering most clichés of the horror genre the main character is the monster; there's only one murder in the entire film; and lastly, it's never a question of who or when in The Shining, but why (did Jack do it?) and how (was he also in the past?), which themselves are questions left arguably ambiguous at the end. Its this very ambiguity, one of the most non- genre devices there is, that elevates The Shining to not just the top of the best horror movie lists, but perhaps on to the best films ever lists. For me, ambiguous conclusions make for great psycho-logical film, and The Shining is just that.Released in 1980, The Shining was Kubrick's next film after 1975's Barry Lyndon (his best?). Based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, Kubrick rejected King's own adaptation and instead enlisted the aid of novelist Diane Johnson to help write the screenplay. Many King-lovers decry the script's strong differences with the actual source material, but who cares? Considering King's own at-best-mediocre screenplays, and his disastrous attempt at film directing &#x96; the mind-numbing Maximum Overdrive &#x96; I have no problem trusting that Kubrick knew how to make a film better than Mr. King.The Shining is, on its surface, a ghost story. A failed, alcoholic, and abusive husband and father, one Jack Torrance, decides to take a winter-season caretaker position at the Overlook Hotel, in hopes that the seclusion will help him to rebuild his life, and also assist in revitalizing his creative juices as a writer. Despite the warnings of cabin fever, and the story of a past murder\/suicide by a previous caretaker of his entire family, Jack takes the position and travels to the Overlook, with his mousy, chain-smoking, battered-wife syndrome poster- girl spouse, Wendy. They also have a son, the often bruised yet powerfully clairvoyant, Danny, who foresees the evil, but is powerless to understand or prevent it. Of course we, and the entire Torrance family, soon learn that the hotel is named Overlook because, one it's what you should do if you ever come across it, and two because it affords glorious views of Hell. Whether it's a simple case of one man going mad, a genuine haunting\/possession, multiple hauntings, or if the hotel itself is an evil and sentient being, we never really know. The majestic and horrifying images Kubrick creates, his nail-biting pacing, the revolutionary steadicam work of John Alcott, and the performances of all three major characters, make The Shining one of the most atmospheric nightmares on celluloid.And something else about The Shining not often said, is that it's the only film starring Jack Nicholson that isn't overpowered by Nicholson himself.

They also have a son, the often bruised yet powerfully clairvoyant, Danny, who foresees the evil, but is powerless to understand or prevent it. Of course we, and the entire Torrance family, soon learn that the hotel is named Overlook because, one it's what you should do if you ever come across it, and two because it affords glorious views of Hell. Whether it's a simple case of one man going mad, a genuine haunting\/possession, multiple hauntings, or if the hotel itself is an evil and sentient being, we never really know.

And though I would venture to say that nothing Kubrick ever made could be safely classified as a genre picture, The Shining is almost always, and rightfully so, listed among the top horror films of all time. But Kubrick always found a way to transcend these genres he chose to immerse himself in, whether they were noir, gladiator, (anti-)war, sci-fi, period drama, contemporary satire, etc. And out of his entire oeuvre, The Shining is perhaps the most perfect example of said transcendence, shattering most clichés of the horror genre the main character is the monster; there's only one murder in the entire film; and lastly, it's never a question of who or when in The Shining, but why (did Jack do it?) and how (was he also in the past?), which themselves are questions left arguably ambiguous at the end. Its this very ambiguity, one of the most non- genre devices there is, that elevates The Shining to not just the top of the best horror movie lists, but perhaps on to the best films ever lists. For me, ambiguous conclusions make for great psycho-logical film, and The Shining is just that.Released in 1980, The Shining was Kubrick's next film after 1975's Barry Lyndon (his best?). Based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, Kubrick rejected King's own adaptation and instead enlisted the aid of novelist Diane Johnson to help write the screenplay. Many King-lovers decry the script's strong differences with the actual source material, but who cares? Considering King's own at-best-mediocre screenplays, and his disastrous attempt at film directing &#x96; the mind-numbing Maximum Overdrive &#x96; I have no problem trusting that Kubrick knew how to make a film better than Mr. King.The Shining is, on its surface, a ghost story.

Featuring tough men on a mission against ridiculous odds, most of these films used war, not to express any moral or patriotic sentiment, but as vehicles for action, aimed primarily at the young modern audiences of the Vietnam era, and their aging WW2 era fathers.The Guns of Navarone is one of the worst films in this wave. Based on a novel by Alistair MacLean, it's a routine mission movie in which a rag tag bunch of guys join forces to bomb a German gun emplacement. The film ignores the politics of WW2, ignores the mindset of those taking part in the film's suicide mission and reduces Germans to sock puppets.Superficial and stupid, the film anticipates Steven Spielberg's boy's own adventures set against serious backdrops, and contains several scenes akin to Saving Private Ryan, most notably one in which our heroes wrestle over whether or not to kill an enemy officer.One can rationalise these films being made during WW2 (dehumanising the enemy is common in propaganda), but to make such a thing in 1961 (or 1998 as in Spielberg's case) is simply unconscionable. David Lean, and the moral probings of various other Brit directors during the 50s, had rendered this stuff obsolete by 1961, and yet the film was a huge success in the US, raking in piles of cash. No surprise that The Guns of Navarone was released just before the Vietnam War, just as Ryan was released before the second Gulf War, both films priming their nations for some down and dirty warmongering (cf historian Patrick McCormick).By the time the Vietnam war hit and was drawing to a close, The Guns of Navarone's imitators (Kelly's Heroes, The Dirty Dozen etc) had found a way to rationalise their unscrupulous subject matter by embracing and exploring their roots in junk, trash and exploitation cinema (hence Tarantino's fondness for these films, and his homage, Inglorious Basterds). Indeed, it's an understanding of their debased roots that make fare like Inglorious Basterds and The Dirty Dozen so interesting. Dozen, for example, is implicitly about both the perversion of cinematic justice and the impossibility of honour, and goes out of its way to show how evil exists, not mysteriously in the hearts of Nazis, but in complicit men, women and soldiers on both sides.But even if one switches off the brain, The Guns of Navarone fails as a mindless action movie. Actors Gregory Peck, David Niven, Anthony Quinn and James Darren turn in some wooden, stiff performances, and though director J. Lee Thompson's action scenes are sudden, violent and brutal, the film is ponderously slow when the bullets aren't flying.6.9\/10 &#x96; This film needs some Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood and Terry Savalas.

The film is a really engrossing drama centering on a number of disparate residents of Los Angeles round about the time of the film's production; a snapshot of warts-and-all living in amongst both the higher-ups and lower-downs of a city plagued by a heatwave; an insect infestation and, it would seem, the odd earthquake. Altman and his film take very few short cuts to anywhere at all, his film is just as interested in the catalysts of life that drive us to where we end up as it is the intricacies that unfold around these events with others we may already know. Take, for instance, a sequence early on involving a group of fishermen whom discover a dead body in the waters the're around; where another film may have picked up on that and run with it as a plot mechanism inciting causality, Short Cuts allows the men to take note of the situation before making a decision which allows the film to consequently revolve around something else other than a set premise. Short Cuts being of an ilk which will later explore how this decision they make comes to affect each of them and their relations with certain others. The film begins with a physical placing of the audience high above ground level, a flock of helicopters equipped with pesticide late at night gliding through the sky so as to eliminate a recent pest problem which is plaguing the area. Beginning so high up enables the first shot of the entire film to be one of an establishing variety, the following three or so hours coming to revolve around what feels like all of those within the vicinity of this locale and a sense of power or establishing of power which comes with the ability to access such private tales in these people's lives. The film goes on to flit from a pool cleaner named Jerry Kaiser, played by Chris Penn; to a limousine driver Tom Waits' Earl Piggot; to Robert Downey Jr.'s layabout Bill Bush whom takes a swig from a beer can during breakfast as well as a large proportion of others all mingling in and around what appears to be an individual block.To list every actor or actress and their role would be beside the point, needless to say, the film isn't so much preoccupied with the gimmick that their lives and existences should become entwined, as much as it is the thematics of each of their tales that are eerily similar to everyone else's; the overlying idea that regardless of age; gender; marital situation or class distinction death, or loss, affects us all and the ingredient of deconstructing these characters' attitudes towards sex or love keeps the film on that so-called path seeing it explore the two things humankind is apparently so fascinated by - the thesis or pitch makes the film sound terribly self-important; it is, in actuality, anything but. Altman's bounding from person to person; from character to character; from family to family is enthralling, the staying with each bunch of characters for what feels like the minimal of time before heading onto the next port of call somehow manages to get across as much in the way of development and a feel for who these people successfully executed with the smallest of hassle in the shortest span of time possible.Altman produces amusing transitions which propel us from tale to tale, his ability as a director to link or build bridges between seemingly disparate sequences away from core thematics works wonderfully. A glass of milk sits idly on the side in a room, specifically for Ann Finnigan's (MacDowell) son Casey whom was hit by Doreen Piggot's (Tomlin) car but got up and merely walked home in shock; a cut later, we're on another class of milk in somebody else's house &#x96; that of the husband, Earl, whose wife it is that hit the child. The television in Earl's house speaks of accidents happening and that care ought to be taken; the-then leaping to the three fishermen and their continual ignoring, for now, of a dead body sees us effortlessly transit back into the city and young cellist Zoe (Singer) whom lies face down in a swimming pool in a state of mock-drowning. Where Zoe's tale comes to lead us, as she struggles to hold down a basic relationship with her mother Tess (Ross), sees these seeds that are planted of a very ominous kind.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"15 November 2010","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" A common complaint I read about Spellbound is that it panders, indeed every few minutes Ingrid Bergman sits down with someone to explain and be explained psychiatric babble, guilt complex, amnesia, dreams, every small psychologic detail that is introduced as plot function is laid down bear before the audience at some point, their design and pattern revealed clear and rational like a clock mechanism might work, this is how it works, this is what it does to you. This complaint attempts to shift blame to the handy scapegoat, producer David Selznick. The Spellbound I am repulsed at every attempt to like, that forces me to sift through the cloggings of plot to find an original idea that was intriguing at some point, much like Rear Window then, is the Alfred Hitchcock film.It's that film made by someone who wants to be all things to all people, where the protagonists must fall in love, that love which is the undying foolhardy love of a lifetime (can we start calling this 'movie love'?), where every few scenes, almost mechanically, comic relief must be inserted lest the film be too grim for an audience, where the director speaks about love, fear, madness, sanity, in the same flat tone of voice, never enunciating anything, never with a particular inflection or mannerism, as though a bulldozer has steamrolled through the finished film to rid it of any anomalies. When Bergman falls in love she falls in love with declarations of soaring emotion, when Gregory Peck goes mad he goes mad by babbling incoherencies and fainting and wielding razorblades, and when a character notices a small revealing detail said by the villain that detail is repeated inside her head with thunderous echo.The one Spellbound I would begin to like is the Spellbound that ends with Gregory Peck the killer and Ingrid Bergman shocked to the depths of her soul that she has fallen in love with a man capable of murder. That question is interesting to me, is love a safeguard instinct, a moral compass that we can trust at all times to point north, or do we fall in love against our better judgment with people who can be bad? And more, when we do, what does that say about us? Hitchcock's film is not one that has the balls to end with shattered worlds and burning questions though, in the end Ingrid Bergman is reassured that she didn't love a guilty man. I liked a lot the dream sequence based on Salvador Dali designs, with the masked faces and the eye curtains, which is too bad because two psychiatrists sit down keeping notes in their pads to translate every small detail of that dream. ","genre":null},{"date":"15 November 2010","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" A common complaint I read about Spellbound is that it panders, indeed every few minutes Ingrid Bergman sits down with someone to explain and be explained psychiatric babble, guilt complex, amnesia, dreams, every small psychologic detail that is introduced as plot function is laid down bear before the audience at some point, their design and pattern revealed clear and rational like a clock mechanism might work, this is how it works, this is what it does to you. This complaint attempts to shift blame to the handy scapegoat, producer David Selznick. The Spellbound I am repulsed at every attempt to like, that forces me to sift through the cloggings of plot to find an original idea that was intriguing at some point, much like Rear Window then, is the Alfred Hitchcock film.It's that film made by someone who wants to be all things to all people, where the protagonists must fall in love, that love which is the undying foolhardy love of a lifetime (can we start calling this 'movie love'?), where every few scenes, almost mechanically, comic relief must be inserted lest the film be too grim for an audience, where the director speaks about love, fear, madness, sanity, in the same flat tone of voice, never enunciating anything, never with a particular inflection or mannerism, as though a bulldozer has steamrolled through the finished film to rid it of any anomalies. When Bergman falls in love she falls in love with declarations of soaring emotion, when Gregory Peck goes mad he goes mad by babbling incoherencies and fainting and wielding razorblades, and when a character notices a small revealing detail said by the villain that detail is repeated inside her head with thunderous echo.The one Spellbound I would begin to like is the Spellbound that ends with Gregory Peck the killer and Ingrid Bergman shocked to the depths of her soul that she has fallen in love with a man capable of murder. That question is interesting to me, is love a safeguard instinct, a moral compass that we can trust at all times to point north, or do we fall in love against our better judgment with people who can be bad?
