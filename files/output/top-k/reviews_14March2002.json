The answer is that the artificial gravity used throughout the pressurized compartments of the ship doesn't have to end at the atmosphere barrier. The Flight deck would have to have gravity so fighters could land. And to push Forbes' fighter into a zero-g environment from the flight deck might block the incoming fighters' approach, hence the pit for crashed fighters.In some ways, this movie reminded me of Space Above and Beyond. There was racism, malevolent aliens, and the very REAL message that people die in war zones.As far as the drop off the flight deck, it looks unrealistic but so what? This was a fun movie and a good way to spend a couple of hours on a rainy Saturday afternoon. If you want movies with a message or realism, don't rent Science FICTION.

I really enjoyed BlackHawk down, and i was expecting something of similar entertainment.  I did not like this movie at all, it disgusted me and filled my heart with rage.To understand why i may feel this way, i will tell you about myself.  I am Eurasian (asian and european), my father is from Vietnam, and he immigrated shortly after the Vietnam war.  This movie reminded me of other peices of garbage - like Rambo.  Movies like BlackHawk down and WWS are entertaining if have your eyes closed to the world.The movies these days are following a disturbing trend. 1. Killing large amounts of people is OK 2. America rules 3. Being a soldier who gets payed to KILL people is OK and a very important and honorable role. 4. UNCLE SAM WANTS YOU! 5. They did it to us, lets do it to them back - Revenge is OK 6. NationalismI havent seen a larger amount of propaganda in my whole life.  Could it be that just maybe these movies are an attempt to get young Americans to join the war against the axis of evil.Personally, if America wants to go to war against tyranny, and calls on its allies, i will be hard pressed to decide which side to fight on- given that America runs programs such as the school of the americas.This movie did not do enough to show both sides of the story.  The US forces are shown as nazi supermen - i'm sorry, did i say nazi? --- i mean American Supermen.The part of the film that enraged me the most was when the american artilleryman was hit my napalm, you saw the horror of napalm.  What they dont show, of course, is the suffering of the hundreds of Vietnamese going though the same thing on that battle field.  Oh yes, and the countless villages of innocent people that were massacred or napalmed in Vietnam.The next time i see a movie like this i am going to walk out of the theatre. I recommend Platoon or Appocalypse Now if you want a more touching movie about the Vietnam tragedy.Rating 2\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"14 March 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I was excited about this movie while i was standing in line with my friend.

Black Hawk Down ranks up with other movies such as Saving Private Ryan and Platoon, however those wars would decades ago, when in fact this film takes place in recent 1993, when most of us were still alive. The film is based on a very closely related story with true characters and plot. Ridley Scott, one of my most favorite directors, again shows his great talent in Black Hawk Down by going to the limits to make the movie real, and it is very real. I've heard from many magazine articles praising this movie that it is the most realistic war movie out there. It goes deep into you and makes you think how bad war really is. The majority of the soldiers that were sent on the relief mission to Somalia were young and many had never gone into battle before. The film captures the true emotion of these young men when they realize within an hour how bad and unexpectedly bloody a war or special op can get. Hans Zimmer composes yet another great score (he worked with director Ridley Scott on Gladiator also). I am now reading the book, which is just as engrossing as the film, if not more. The thing about this war film was that it is a story of modern war, not WWII or Vietnam or any wars before that. It is also different in a way because these soldiers were sitting ducks and were attacked without warning, so it shows some of the realistic reactions of the soldiers when this occurs like in no other war movie. The film also is focused on one single overnight battle, not several battles as in other war films. Although this may seem to get boring after a while, the film is full of action. If you are looking for impressive special effects and gore and are turning away from this movie believing that the fact that only a little more than a dozen americans were killed decreases its gore, don't. You get plenty of effects and blood in this movie, just as much as all the other war dramas. The actors did a great job in adding to the film's realistic value by showing a variety of emotions during the surprise battle--anger, sadness, and fright. This is quite possibly the greatest war movie out there right now, and I highly recommend it. 9\/10 ","genre":"Drama, History, War"},{"date":"14 March 2002","score":"","review":"  If you're going to see this movie for the first time, see it in the theater, because it is much more powerful with the surround sound (the good sound effects add to it also) just as with any war movie.

So when I was at first annoyed and angered by the beginning of this movie, I passed it off to his soon-to-come deeper agenda, which in Dr. T... never arrives.I loathe this movie.  Let me count the ways1. (Most importantly) We are led to empathize with a man who believes he loves too much, too hard, and hence, the consequences.  This, if played out, would be great, as he gets his come-uppance, realizes the self-delusion and that his life and ways with women is a lie.  But that's not what happens. We are supposed to feel sorry for and sympathize with him the entire way, even as he cheats, avoids true responsibility and, despite what the ending is supposed to say, never changes.  Rather than the boy-birth being a sign of evolution\/change\/enlightenment, it debunks all that came before, in fact saying that all these women were the problem all along.  Instead of being a witty examination of flawed Dallas women, it concludes with a tacked-on non-epiphany, which by its very existence makes everything before it misogynistic, and none of the characters likeable.2.  Watch how many times Altman works in gratuitous nudity, like an 11 yr. old peeping tom.  When he shows Janine Turner's derriere-crack, at the end of her scene, it's not Richard Gere following it with his eyes,  it's the CAMERA, as if to say, hey, look at this -- like a little elbow in our sides.3.  He does the same thing often at the end of scenes, swinging the camera with a wink to pick up a sign, a heavy-handed metaphor or scene-link that is beginning film school pretentious artifice at its worst.4.  The editing and cinematography again is of the film-school variety, and at often times is like a rough cut.5.  Helen Hunt, who for years has been trying to convince us she's newly sexy, is so self-conscious that we never can buy into any kind of character.  I am sick of her flinging her hair.6.  The camera holds so long on the golf sequences, as if to say - these actors really can play golf, which they really don't very well.  But it becomes a call-attention lingering as opposed to a mere setting for dialogue.7.  The overly intrusive soundtrack by Lyle Lovett may be close to the worst in history.  Not only does it blot out large sequences of dialogue, and call attention to itself mindlessly at every turn, it actually has lyrics which say exactly what's going on in the scene.8.  The writing and dialogue are extremely sophomoric; very few times do the people seem real in what they're saying, and often they resort to movie cliche-speak.9.  Gere has a few good real moments, but the direction hurts him as well.10.  Altman's trademark everyone speaking at once, in this movie is contrived and annoying.11. (And maybe worst of all) this movie made me replay all the movies of Altman that I really like and see that many of tendencies above that I criticize are prevalent in ALL of his movies, now tempering my enjoyment of them.  I now see a old lecher with a misogynistic bent and an arrested development, calling attention to his weaknesses in a pretentious and juvenile way.

But the surprising box office performance in the week following its release seems to now suggest otherwise.This is a really fun movie. It's a tad slow at first, but since it's only a short 96 minutes, things get going pretty quick. Guy Pearce is well-cast as the slightly-nerdy mathmetician, Alexander Hartdegen, and the special effects were very well-done (some were shown unfinished in the trailer and in the TV spots, so don't let that deter you.) Two of the best sequences are the two forward-traveling sequences, the first when Pearce begins his journey into the future, with the change from Victorian era to the future flashing by before us during a terrific pull back from the time machine all the way out of Earth's orbit and around to the far side of the moon, where a ship is coming in for a landing on a colony. The second is when Alexander is knocked unconscious by an explosion tremor in the distant future, when explosives mining on the moon have knocked it from its orbit and have caused it to come apart, showering the Earth with moonrocks, and the time machine speeds forward into the very distant future. It's a terrific sequence in which we see the geological evolution of the area in a matter of moments, from cliffside rock formations taking shape to environmental changes and everything in between. A truely awe-inspiring moment that is one of ILM's finest effects sequences.I also liked how they kept a lot of elements from the original good friend Mr. Philby, the spider making a web at the top of Alex's greenhouse, the constantly-changing store window mannequin that appears in the building across from Alex's house, the stop at one point in the future to discover that a disastrous incident is occuring (nuclear war in the original, the moonrock shower in this version), and the entrance to the Morlock's underground lair. Even the talking rings in the original are sort of brought back, though this time in the form of a holographic New York City public library computer (Orlando Jones), whom Alex first encounters in 2030 and again later in the film, set nearly 800,000 years later. The Eloi this time around are not all blonde and lifeless. In the original, they calmly walk into the Morlock's lair when the horns sound. Here, they run fearingfor the lives when the Morlocks come to hunt. And the Morlock's are no longer the lumbering bodybuilders with green body paint and white fright wigs. Here they are taller, more-muscular deadly creatures with an animal-like ferocity, with incredible physical abilities and capable of fast speeds.I think this movie is a good example of what remakes should be. Keeping the concept and elements of the original, while bringing to the material something new. Pearce, as I said, is well-cast as the time traveler, who builds the machine first out of his desire to right a tragedy in his past, then ends up traveling into the future. Samantha Mumba does a fine job in her first feature film role. I'm not too fond of singers who try to make the move to acting (witness the debacles of Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, and countless rappers), but Mumba was pretty good. I have a feeling we'll be seeing her more in the near future. Jeremy Irons' role was too brief, though. Being the Uber-Morlock, I was hoping for more screen time, as well as a lengthier confrontation. But he was still good. If I didn't know it was him, I never would have guessed it. Much to my surprise, his performance is a very restrained one, never exploding into one of those bursting, over-the-top speeches about wanting to overtake the planet. I was also expecting him to attempt to use the time machine to travel back to the past and take control in a time when there were more resources, but that idea (again, much to my surprise and delight) never even comes up. He seemed pretty content just doing things in the time he was in. Still, I would have liked for him to had more screen time.I was also very impressed with the score by newcomer Klaus Badelt, who has worked mostly in association with composer Hans Zimmer, providing Additional Music from films liked HANNIBAL and GLADIATOR. His score here is full of action and emotion, with a heroic main theme and a really nice African tribe-like sound for the Eloi. I look forward to the release of the soundtrack, and I'll be keeping a watch for his future projects. He sounds very promising.My only real complaint is that it all goes by too fast. A full two hours would have been great.In comparison between this one and the original film, I suppose some people would say it lacks the charm of the first.

I like both decade's action movies, but the mid-80's action has the power of nostalgia...After having heard a lot about this particular movie from several friends in my class at college - who were also into B-actions - I decided to dedicate a couple of hours trying to find it. Since the DVD version of this movie probably hasn't been printed in too many copies, there were no DivXs available anywhere.

When Chuck returns home with the POWs at the very end of the movie and enters the hotel where the diplomatic conference is held with an american MIA soldier under his right arm, the movie is abruptly ended and the aftertexts starts scrolling up.

Further down, I will reveal what I thought was the most funny parts of this movie, including stuff from the ending!I would like to start off with introducing myself as a fan of Chuck Norris. Although (or perhaps, just because) I'm a member of Mensa and have just recieved a bachelor's degree in computer networking, I enjoy to sometimes just put the whole intellectual\/elitist attitude behind me and dive into a macho B-action from the 80's starring people like Chuck Norris, Steven Segall, Charles Bronson, Dolph Lundgren or Jean-Claude Van Damme.The mid-80's was the age of bazookas, M16s and M60s, and the heroes were super-heroes who could stand how much punishment as imaginable by the director, just as long as they stayed focused on getting to the goal. 10 years later it became more popular to depict action with a somewhat deeper touch of realism, often performed by people acting as elite troopers with M4s and M249s (weapons which are successors of the classical M16 and the M60). I like both decade's action movies, but the mid-80's action has the power of nostalgia...After having heard a lot about this particular movie from several friends in my class at college - who were also into B-actions - I decided to dedicate a couple of hours trying to find it. Since the DVD version of this movie probably hasn't been printed in too many copies, there were no DivXs available anywhere. So I settled out to do what I should've done from the beginning - supporting one of my favorite action heroes by buying his stuff! I mean, Chuck doesn't seem like the gazillonare-type actor that you see in Sylvester Stallone )So finally, the day before yesterday, tuesday 2002-03-12, I found it at Mega Skivakademien, Stockholm's largest (?) record\/video store in the very heart of the capital kernel. It was on sale, too! Only 99 swedish kronas (less than ten bucks) for 1 hour and 52 minutes of brainless entertainment!So I watched it, and what did I like? These are the things i remember and will carry with me until I become old and senile (or maybe turn psycho after having watched too many B-actions from the 80's)1. The sunglasses Chuck wear at the diplomatic meeting in Vietnam! Brown-to-transparent fade, and they are HUGE!2. Chuck's attack-raft... Its potons are made out of kevlar and therefore it is regarded as bullet-proof! It can take fire from an AK-47 Kalasjnikov without being punctured! Brilliant! D3. After the vietcong have sunk the attack-raft with a rocket launcher and stand laughing at their typical Pacific-Rim-fishing-boat-ish boat, Chuck surfaces with the M60 from the raft that he seems to have dismounted at swimmed up with (those things weigh in at... Like... 30 pounds!) and finished off all three of them in one sweep! Is he cool or what...4.

Thin Red Line told us every man fights his own war.  Black Hawk Down told us that everybody comes home.  There have been many war movies on the dreaded World War II, but never any on real-life war.  Black Hawk Down presents a great presentation of the war in Somalia not a decade ago.  There seems to be a lack of drama in this movie, but it still shows how war is HELL.  People in America take great pride in the countless big and small wars the United States have won, but most do not understand the detail of it.  They don't understand the chaos of war.  Saving Private Ryan had some great drama, but they didn't express enough on the death of soldiers, and the movie presents thousands of soldiers dieing in the beath scene as almost nothing.  Black Hawk Down expressed most (if not all) drama on the death of each and every soldier, that every single man is important to war.  Some people believe that there was too much action in this movie.  I feel it is ok.  In World War II, they had times where they can just enjoy the fields because they have a whole continent to go around.  In Black Hawk Down, they have a small city of 5000 armed Somalians, which means there has to be action in it throughout the movie, because in such a small area, there is not a single point in the day where you can relax.  Black Hawk Down only is about the #150 of the top 250 films.  I believe it should be higher.  Saving Private Ryan changed the views of people of how a war film should be, so they feel this wasn't such a good film.  However, Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan were in 2 long different time periods, and for the time period Black Hawk Down takes place in, this was truly a great presentation of real-life war, and it should be #50 and higher.10\/10 Best war movie replacing Saving Private Ryan. 3rd is The Thin Red Line.

I was disappointed to hear that William Hurt would be playing Rochester. I loved Mr. Hurt's work in Broadcast News, The Accidental Tourist, and just about everything else I've seen him in, but he just doesn't fit the character at all. The Mr. Rochester of the book is dark, brooding, not handsome, and above all, British. I guess we can all be grateful that he didn't try to affect an accent, but he was just wrong for the part. There was absolutely no chemistry between Ms. Gainsbourg and Mr. Hurt. I even rented this movie again to see if it was any better the second viewing, but no, it was still a horrible adaptation.Amanda Root was marvelous as Miss Temple, but she was unable to save this movie. I am amazed that someone such as Mr. Zeferelli could ruin such a good story.Those who want to see a good representation of the book should rent the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke (it's now on DVD!). It was made on a shoestring budget, but it follows the story and the performances were true to the book.

It was originally supposed to be directed by horror veteran George Romero but he decided not to after his script (which was way better) was turned down.  Enter Mr. Anderson...

I won't give much of the simple plot away but here is what I liked and disliked.  Likes  Production.  -Great looking effects and design.  The mansion and facility looked really good and solid. Dead Guys. -The zombies were some of the scariest looking I've seen in a while (very well acted too).  Mostly make-up with good C.G. enhancements. The 'hunters' look pretty good as well.  Gore.  -Bloody but not ridiculous. They could've gone for a P.G.-13 rating for the kiddies but opted to go the whole 9 and make it violent like the game.  Scares.  -I jumped at a few of the scares.  Great if u have your clingy lady-friend sitting near you... ;) OK... now the cons  Dialogue.  -Really bad dialogue at times.  Very bland lines.  Some jokes worked and some didn't.  Acting.  -Other than the main actors (Jovavich and Rodriguez) everyone else seemed deader than the zombies.  Directing.  -Very slow narrative and the action was dull and brief.  There was also too much emphasis on establishing a 'style' with wash-outs and camera angles.  Very distracting...Editing.  -Too many quick cuts.  Plot. Too simple and ineffective with too many plot holes and unoriginality.  This is based on a game that plays like a film so it really shouldn't be 'that' difficult...  Music.  -Probably the worst gripe of all. Crappy 'industrial' music from Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson.  Ugh... It was 'accidental' instead of being 'incidental' music.  It gave a lot of the scares away and was louder than the film itself.  Overall this film is for the fans of the game who will appreciate it more than others who haven't experienced the 'Resident Evil' games.  With a better script and better director this would've worked much better.  Maybe the sequels will be better...P.S.

Ever since learning what one was when I was 4--the same way a lot of children did, by watching The Wizard of Oz--I have hated and feared them all my life. Fortunately, I don't live in tornado country. But once when visiting tornado country for a couple of years and having to live through tornado warnings, I was absolutely terrified.

You would think that I would be even more frightened than the average moviegoer when seeing this film.Surprisingly, even I watched it without a twitch.Instead of a tense action-packed thriller, what we have here is a supremely silly movie that's so inept in logic and plot development that I don't know where to begin.

Just what kind of a technical marvel WAS it she was conversing on, anyway?!As for the crew of tornado chasers... well, that's where the earlier Goofy comment comes into play. We're talking weird, smelly, nerdy, bucktoothed, southern-accent-insulting weirdos here. I mean, you can just imagine their breath smelling of Jack Daniels. Even though Melissa was annoying in her prim neatness, I couldn't help feeling sorry for her--not because her character was interesting, mind you, but because she reacted to these bozos with the exact same disbelief and forced politeness I personally would have!She finally yells at them, YOU'RE ALL CRAZY, YOU KNOW THAT??? My feelings exactly, Melissa.Add into all this overacting leads, a completely predictable love triangle situation AND a ridiculous subplot involving a rival scientist, and you have a film which is pretty good for a few bellylaughs on a Saturday night!Oh, and by the way, the tornadoes look fake. Well, at least they do on the TV-sized screen. Maybe they look more impressive in a theater, I wouldn't know. But on a small television tube they look like a jumble of grey computer graphics, like something out of a videogame. Which, in a way, they certainly are.It won't scare, but I'm pretty positive that you'll laugh at it. It's not Plan 9, but it sure does seem to be the equivlalent of a modern-day Ed Wood production!

Goofy, either!No, wait... on second thought, maybe I am. Let me put it to you this way if a lot of the characters in this flick aren't really clones of Goofy, they're sure close.Tornadoes are my absolute worst fear in the world. Ever since learning what one was when I was 4--the same way a lot of children did, by watching The Wizard of Oz--I have hated and feared them all my life. Fortunately, I don't live in tornado country. But once when visiting tornado country for a couple of years and having to live through tornado warnings, I was absolutely terrified. Even earthquakes, as awful as they are, don't scare me as bad as tornadoes do--that's because an earthquake doesn't look like a giant, living, breathing, demonic THING of a monster hunting you down with an agenda of killing you and devouring everything you own!So I avoided watching this movie for years until now. The first time I ever heard of it was when I went to a local WB store to buy cartoon shirts...and the trailer for this yet-to-be-released-at-that-point film came up on the big screen there, and it scared me so badly that I literally threw up right there on the floor.Now, the reason why I mention all of this is so that you can get a good understanding of what I'm about to describe concerning Twister as entertainment value. You would think that I would be even more frightened than the average moviegoer when seeing this film.Surprisingly, even I watched it without a twitch.Instead of a tense action-packed thriller, what we have here is a supremely silly movie that's so inept in logic and plot development that I don't know where to begin. In fact, it's only a hairsbreath away from being something to be mocked on Mystery Science Theater 3000! I won't go into a list of details which you would have to be blind as a bat to miss, but there's one I just can't resist because it made me laugh so hard--I found it hilarious that everybody was driving right next to dangerous tornadoes, and even between them, and yet all through the bad weather Melissa the therapist continues to get calls on her cel phone and is able to keep perfectly normal conversations with her callers without any call dropping or interference. Just what kind of a technical marvel WAS it she was conversing on, anyway?!As for the crew of tornado chasers... well, that's where the earlier Goofy comment comes into play. We're talking weird, smelly, nerdy, bucktoothed, southern-accent-insulting weirdos here. I mean, you can just imagine their breath smelling of Jack Daniels. Even though Melissa was annoying in her prim neatness, I couldn't help feeling sorry for her--not because her character was interesting, mind you, but because she reacted to these bozos with the exact same disbelief and forced politeness I personally would have!She finally yells at them, YOU'RE ALL CRAZY, YOU KNOW THAT??? My feelings exactly, Melissa.Add into all this overacting leads, a completely predictable love triangle situation AND a ridiculous subplot involving a rival scientist, and you have a film which is pretty good for a few bellylaughs on a Saturday night!Oh, and by the way, the tornadoes look fake. Well, at least they do on the TV-sized screen. Maybe they look more impressive in a theater, I wouldn't know. But on a small television tube they look like a jumble of grey computer graphics, like something out of a videogame.

In fact, I could go so far as to say it was quite watchable. admittedly, there are plot holes, Michelle Rodriguez seems wasted in her role, and the material owes a great debt to George Romero's work, but once one gets past all that, a big dumb popcorn movie is there for the taking. In its favor, the actors give convincing performances, the cgi effects are used sparingly enough so that when one does get large doses of it, they don't look obviously fake like in the Harry Potter movie or _Jumanji_, and the movie overall displays an understanding that while it doesn't have the chops to actually scare you, it also doesn't over-rely on startling moments like so many horror movies will nowadays. Is it worth the full price of admission? Compared to some of the alternatives playing in theaters, I'm afraid so.As a sidenote, who among us knew that, at this point in our lives, with Paul T.

Disney went whole hog and spiffed this puppy up with a full-fledged 5.1 presentation, which serves to amplify the emotions evoked by the film. I'm not ashamed to admit that this film still makes me weep, and that emotion was not diminished in any way by the IMAX presentation.
