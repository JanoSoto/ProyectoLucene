In fact, I really can't think of anything bad about the film, though I did find it a bit odd seeing Cary Grant play a role that seemed more designed around an actor like Clark Gable or perhaps Gary Cooper. In other words, seeing the sophisticated gent that was Cary Grant in the South American jungle just didn't seem real. It wasn't really a problem with Grant's performance but more my expectations based on the types of roles he generally played.The story is about a small struggling airline in the Andes and the group of outcasts who often give up their lives trying to make the dream work. Cary is the boss and the entire organization is thrown into some disarray when Jean Arthur enters this all-male enclave.

An example was Six Days, Seven Nights in which David Schwimmer essentially played Ross from Friends under another name. In The Good Girl, Schwimmer's co-star Jennifer Aniston appears to be trying to escape this trap by getting as far away as she can from her yuppie-chick Rachel character. She plays Justine, a thirty-something checkout clerk in a downmarket small-town supermarket. We learn that seven years earlier Justine had the opportunity to go to college, but turned it down for fear of losing her boyfriend Phil. This was a bad move. Phil, now Justine's husband, is a dull, boorish slob who, when not working as a painter, spends all his time with his good friend Bubba watching TV or getting stoned. (The name Bubba seems to be cinematic shorthand for redneck poor white trash). Phil and Bubba's one gesture in the direction of unconventionality is that their drug of choice is an illegal one (cannabis) rather than the more socially acceptable alcohol.It is a stock Hollywood cliché that life is only worth living if one has the good fortune to live in a major city on America's East or West coast. The Middle American small town, even if it appears happy and tranquil at first sight, is generally portrayed as a pretty hellish place to live, and the Texas town where Justine lives does not even bother trying to hide its hellishness behind a façade of happiness and tranquillity. Yet, even though the main characteristic of life in the town seems to be a soul-destroying dullness, the only people who are seriously discontented with their lot are Justine and her workmate Holden Worther, a young man in his early twenties.Holden's real name (or, as he puts it, his slave name) is Tom, but he has renamed himself after the hero of Catcher in the Rye. That should have been a clue to his real character, but Justine has presumably never read Salinger's novel and so misses this obvious danger signal. Holden is a geeky loner, obsessed with the idea that he is misunderstood by an uncaring society. He sees the equally malcontent Justine as a kindred spirit and the two embark on an affair. From Justine's point of view, this proves to be an even worse move than her marriage to Phil, as Holden is not only possessive but also mentally unbalanced. Worse still, their affair is discovered by Bubba, who has long cherished an unrequited lust for Justine and takes the opportunity to blackmail her into sleeping with him. Justine begins to wonder whether she might not be better off with Phil after all; he may be a slob, but he is, basically, a decent-hearted slob. He is one of the few major characters in this film who never does anything spiteful or mean-minded.The film does not take its subject-matter altogether seriously, but for most of the time its overall tone is not so much one of humour- not even black humour- but what might best be described as ironical distancing. There are, however, some effective pieces of satire. Cheryl, another of Justine's colleagues, uses the supermarket's public address system to insult customers, generally without them noticing. A vegetarian health-food zealot dies of food poisoning after eating contaminated blackberries. A fire-and-brimstone Christian fundamentalist turns out to be a hypocrite and a creepy pervert. (Actually, that last one is probably not satire, just Hollywood's standard view of conservative Christianity).Aniston is reasonably good as Justine, although I did not think her performance merited an Oscar nomination, as some have suggested. Most of the other actors turn in good performances, within the limits of the one-dimensional way in which most of the characters are written. The film's main drawback is that, like a number of satires aimed at small-town America, it tends to stereotype and patronise its subjects. It seems to be written from the standpoint that Holden and Justine are to be pitied because they are so miserable at having to live in such a godforsaken place and that all the other townspeople are to be pitied because they are so stupid that they do not realise how miserable they are. (It must be said, however, that The Good Girl is far from being the worst offender in this respect- that probably being the crude and ill-natured Drop Dead Gorgeous).

JORDAN. And it also is the only time that two of the best actors of the golden age of sound films worked in a film side by side in the same scenes of a movie.* I am referring to Mr. Paul Muni, who played Tony Carmonte in SCARFACE and Mr. Claude Rains, who played that beacon of heavenly fairness and decency Mr. Jordan in HERE COMES MR. JORDAN. (*The two actors actually appeared in a film before this JUAREZ in 1939. But Paul Muni played Benito Juarez, and shared no scene with Rains as Napoleon III of France - the two leaders never met.)Muni's Eddie Kagle is a reprise of his Tony Carmonte, complete with Carmonte's deadly looking slit-like stare. But at the start of the film he is murdered by Smiley Williams (Hardie Albright - who is always smiling), and finds himself in the netherworld's lower regions. In some ways Eddie's discovery of Hell is among the best part of the film, as he sees the other inhabitants are all in a state of continuous agony and realization of their own sins. Eddie does not have sufficient time to suffer to become as zombie-like. A stranger comes to him, offering him an opportunity to get out of that place. Eddie is willing to hear the deal.The stranger is Rains, naturally playing the Devil (and thus joining the ranks of Walter Huston, Adolphe Menjou, Ray Milland, Laird Cregar, Ray Walston, and Edward Arnold). Rains is a businesslike Devil, who complains to his henchman that the place is too cold (the henchman increases the heat). He has nothing currently going on, when he has noticed Muni. Muni's Eddie Kagle resembles a Judge Parker, an honest, upright man who is running for governor of his state. Rains realizes that if Kagle can replace Parker, then he can ruin the Judge's campaign for cleaning up the corruption in his state.So Rains makes his offer to the eager Muni if Kagle agrees to this switch, playing the role of Parker while the latter is in an enforced coma, and undoing Parker's campaign, Kagle will get a chance to even the score with good old Smiler. Muni is definitely interested, but he wants a guarantee of no double-crossing. He knows his Devil as well as any other human, and he does not want old Smiler to get away.This is the main problem that perplexes Rains in the movie. He is the author of all the mischief in the universe, but he is also unable to fully control how that mischief is working (an interesting variation on the Devil - compare Rains here with Milland as Nick Beal or Walter Huston (for the most part) as Mr. Scratch). The best moment illustrating this problem Rains gets Muni worked up to deliver a violent tirade that would send Judge Parker's campaign into the toilet. But a bunch of gangsters, opposed to Parker, arrange for the Judge to be met with a barrage of garbage thrown at him on stage when he's about to speak, knocking him out. Rains is flabbergasted by this, and he can't prevent it the gangsters are doing his work too. Kagel\/Parker is not condemned in the papers but praised for his bravery against the gangsters.Also, as the film progresses, Muni meets the Judge's girlfriend Barbara Foster (Anne Baxter). He falls for her, and she slowly corrupts him - he starts wondering if the Judge and Barbara don't have the better view of the world.The film is a good fantasy, that resolves well - a kind of a twist, in fact, on the conclusion of CASABLANCA, with Muni and Rains walking off together, tied by the knot of their agreement. But who will win - we are never certain until the end.The title of the film, by the way, is based on a line of dialog from a sermon that a minister (Erskine Sanford) is preparing and reads out loud.

But Paul Muni played Benito Juarez, and shared no scene with Rains as Napoleon III of France - the two leaders never met.)Muni's Eddie Kagle is a reprise of his Tony Carmonte, complete with Carmonte's deadly looking slit-like stare. But at the start of the film he is murdered by Smiley Williams (Hardie Albright - who is always smiling), and finds himself in the netherworld's lower regions. In some ways Eddie's discovery of Hell is among the best part of the film, as he sees the other inhabitants are all in a state of continuous agony and realization of their own sins. Eddie does not have sufficient time to suffer to become as zombie-like. A stranger comes to him, offering him an opportunity to get out of that place. Eddie is willing to hear the deal.The stranger is Rains, naturally playing the Devil (and thus joining the ranks of Walter Huston, Adolphe Menjou, Ray Milland, Laird Cregar, Ray Walston, and Edward Arnold). Rains is a businesslike Devil, who complains to his henchman that the place is too cold (the henchman increases the heat). He has nothing currently going on, when he has noticed Muni. Muni's Eddie Kagle resembles a Judge Parker, an honest, upright man who is running for governor of his state. Rains realizes that if Kagle can replace Parker, then he can ruin the Judge's campaign for cleaning up the corruption in his state.So Rains makes his offer to the eager Muni if Kagle agrees to this switch, playing the role of Parker while the latter is in an enforced coma, and undoing Parker's campaign, Kagle will get a chance to even the score with good old Smiler. Muni is definitely interested, but he wants a guarantee of no double-crossing. He knows his Devil as well as any other human, and he does not want old Smiler to get away.This is the main problem that perplexes Rains in the movie. He is the author of all the mischief in the universe, but he is also unable to fully control how that mischief is working (an interesting variation on the Devil - compare Rains here with Milland as Nick Beal or Walter Huston (for the most part) as Mr. Scratch). The best moment illustrating this problem Rains gets Muni worked up to deliver a violent tirade that would send Judge Parker's campaign into the toilet. But a bunch of gangsters, opposed to Parker, arrange for the Judge to be met with a barrage of garbage thrown at him on stage when he's about to speak, knocking him out. Rains is flabbergasted by this, and he can't prevent it the gangsters are doing his work too. Kagel\/Parker is not condemned in the papers but praised for his bravery against the gangsters.Also, as the film progresses, Muni meets the Judge's girlfriend Barbara Foster (Anne Baxter). He falls for her, and she slowly corrupts him - he starts wondering if the Judge and Barbara don't have the better view of the world.The film is a good fantasy, that resolves well - a kind of a twist, in fact, on the conclusion of CASABLANCA, with Muni and Rains walking off together, tied by the knot of their agreement.

Always have, and probably, always will.But if there is one thing that annoys me about it, it is the fact that a very small amount of films live up to the hype and talk that surrounds them, good or bad. Rarely am I ever impressed throughly by a film, and even more rare is when the film actually lives up to what people are saying about it. Although it is not perfect by any stretch, I feel that John Waters' masterwork of sorts, Pink Flamingos, is one such film that lives up to everything that has been said about it, and more.The plot is simple. Divine has been proclaimed as the filthiest person alive, and is now living in a trailer out in the middle of nowhere with her family under the name Babs Johnson. Unfortunately, the Marbles, Raymond (David Lochary) and Connie (Mink Stole), feel they rightfully deserve the title, and set into motion a series of plans to challenge her title reign.It is not much, but the film stretches this plot line through ninety-plus minutes of some of the most disgusting and vile acts ever put to celluloid. The only modern thing I could possibly compare it to are the gross-out gags (and not silly stunts) from Jackass, and even they are pretty tame compared to this. Without going into a whole lot of detail, you will be mortified, disgusted, offended and you may just catch yourself in hysterics. This film pulled out all the stops, and thankfully (if that is indeed the right word) did not have to sacrifice anything to get into theatres. It is completely uncut and untouched from Waters' original vision, and for that, is an obvious rise above everything we have now, which is forced to be decent and politically correct.It is obvious then why this film became and continues to stay popular. Even though standards have changed, this film still manages to feel contemporary. It bravely stands its ground, and does everything that any movie could possibly want to do and more. It is unflinching in its graphic sexual depictions, and even more so in some of the overly vile situations the characters find themselves in. This movie was made and shown to the public the way it was originally envisioned, not by the way of what someone else wanted. This is the type of film that everyone in Hollywood wishes they were a part of. In an age where political correctness is forced, and controversy is avoided, this movie represents everything that a 2006 audience cannot see on a movie screen. In this way, it is both sad and touching to note what our society has evolved into 34 years after this film. And it is only ironic to note that it was released the exact same year as the pornographic classic, Deep Throat.If there is anything wrong in my mind with the film (content notwithstanding), it is my issue with the motivation of the Marbles. Yes, the acting is totally amateur, and yes, some of the dialogue is absolutely horrendous, but for the point of the film to really be about a challenge to a title, you would think there would be a reason for the challenge in the first place. To me, it just seems like the Marbles randomly want something that someone else has. Hell, they are not even nearly as filthy as they seem to want to be (or claim to be for that matter). Everything else seems to be well expressed and thoughtfully put to the screen, except for this. Did Waters just not know what to do for these characters, or did he just happen to leave it out thinking it was not all that important? It aggravated me to no end while watching the film, and still does as I write this. It is too easy a detail to miss, and for that reason, feels incomplete in my mind.But while some of the actors just barely make an attempt at being serious in the light of the ridiculous humour of the whole film, Divine stands above them all. Her (or his) performance is electric and is the stuff of legend. If Waters made bad taste more mainstream, than Divine was the reason why people took notice. This is the real actor of the bunch, and the real reason why this film did so well initially. People wanted to see Divine do sick and twisted things, and look good doing it. She is believable as this notorious figure, and even the shoddiest of dialogue sounds poetic coming from her. It really is a shame that she (or he) did not break out of these low-budget B-movies. Yes, Divine made a name for herself with the help of John Waters (as he did with Divine), but you cannot help but wonder what would have happened if Divine moved into the realm of the mainstream.While I definitely enjoyed the film, I cannot help but fathom that I will probably never be able to endure watching the film in its entirety again. It has a lasting feel to it, and I can only hope that more people watch it, but I just do not think I will ever have it in me to give the film another whirl. But I must concede that I will always have the utmost respect for it, and will always tell the right people looking for a hearty laugh to give it a shot. The content might be a little hard to take, but if a movie like Jackass can make people laugh, then I am sure that Pink Flamingos can deliver even more so.6\/10.

Yet the result is intriguingly fresh and creative.The best adjective to describe the movie's tone is whimsical. It's the type of sci-fi film with an almost childlike fascination with strange sights and happenings. Rarely has a film so pessimistic been this much fun. Many sci-fi films since Brazil have attempted a similar approach, usually with little success. The chief problem with most such films (e.g. The Fifth Element) is that they get bogged down in plot at the expense of emotional resonance. Brazil avoids this fate while the movie possesses psychological and thematic complexity, its plot is fairly simple, and the humor, quirky as it is, never relies on throwaway gags. Even the oddest moments have a certain poignance.The story seems to take place in a fascist alternative world. It isn't the future exactly. The technology is weird-looking but hardly superior to anything in our world. Money transactions are sent through pipes in what looks sort of like a crude version of ATM.

The pop culture references are positively retro, from the title song to scenes from the film Casablanca.The evil of the government in this film is driven not so much by cruelty as by bureaucratic incompetence, much of which is played for laughs. But some of the scenes look eerie today, in our post-9\/11 world, and are good fodder for conspiracy theorists. Pay particular attention to the scene where the official boasts that the government is winning its war against the terrorists. The movie is ambiguous as to whether there are any real terrorists, and we have a sneaking suspicion that the explosions are caused by the government itself. The plot is set in motion by a typographical error leading an innocent man to be arrested instead of a suspected terrorist. The movie is not about this man but about a meek government worker, Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), who's observing from the sidelines. Robert De Niro has a cameo as the wanted terrorist whose crime, from what we see, consists of doing home repairs without the proper paperwork.I have noticed that most of the classic dystopian tales are fundamentally similar to one another. But Brazil approaches the genre in a uniquely psychological way. Sam Lowry is different from the standard protagonist who rebels against the government due to noble motives. He doesn't seem to have any larger goals than his own personal ones. He isn't trying to make the world a better place. He's only longing for a better life for himself, one more exciting and romantic than the humdrum existence he currently occupies, where he's beset by an overbearing mother, a pitiful boss, and a dull job. In the midst of this bureaucratic nightmare state, he cares only about such matters as getting his air conditioning fixed and stalking a female stranger who physically resembles his fantasy woman--or so he perceives. The woman, as played by Kim Greist, appears in his fantasies as a helpless damsel with long, flowing hair and a silky dress who sits in a cage while he battles a giant Samurai warrior. The real-life woman he pursues, also played by Greist, sports a butch haircut, drives a large truck, and has a cigarette dangling from the corner of her mouth.It's a testament to Pryce's performance that he commands our total sympathy the whole time. We feel for him and go along with the romantic adventure he attempts to create for himself. His nervous, stammering personality is one that would have been easy to overdo, yet Pryce strikes just the right note, especially as we begin questioning the character's sanity. At one point, another character tells him that You're paranoid; you've got no sense of reality. But who wouldn't be paranoid in such a setting? The scene brings to mind the old joke that goes You're not paranoid. Everyone really is out to get you. The movie inhabits such a whacky, surreal world full of strange people and sights that Sam Lowry almost seems sensible by comparison.

Eliot Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal. Terry Gilliam is one of cinema's mature poets. His Brazil features homages to numerous other films, ranging from Modern Times to The Empire Strikes Back, and its plot is broadly similar to Nineteen Eighty-Four. Yet the result is intriguingly fresh and creative.The best adjective to describe the movie's tone is whimsical. It's the type of sci-fi film with an almost childlike fascination with strange sights and happenings. Rarely has a film so pessimistic been this much fun. Many sci-fi films since Brazil have attempted a similar approach, usually with little success. The chief problem with most such films (e.g. The Fifth Element) is that they get bogged down in plot at the expense of emotional resonance. Brazil avoids this fate while the movie possesses psychological and thematic complexity, its plot is fairly simple, and the humor, quirky as it is, never relies on throwaway gags. Even the oddest moments have a certain poignance.The story seems to take place in a fascist alternative world. It isn't the future exactly. The technology is weird-looking but hardly superior to anything in our world. Money transactions are sent through pipes in what looks sort of like a crude version of ATM. (One of the film's several nods to silent movies occurs after a character tries to stuff one of these pipes with wads of paper.) The pop culture references are positively retro, from the title song to scenes from the film Casablanca.The evil of the government in this film is driven not so much by cruelty as by bureaucratic incompetence, much of which is played for laughs. But some of the scenes look eerie today, in our post-9\/11 world, and are good fodder for conspiracy theorists. Pay particular attention to the scene where the official boasts that the government is winning its war against the terrorists. The movie is ambiguous as to whether there are any real terrorists, and we have a sneaking suspicion that the explosions are caused by the government itself. The plot is set in motion by a typographical error leading an innocent man to be arrested instead of a suspected terrorist. The movie is not about this man but about a meek government worker, Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), who's observing from the sidelines. Robert De Niro has a cameo as the wanted terrorist whose crime, from what we see, consists of doing home repairs without the proper paperwork.I have noticed that most of the classic dystopian tales are fundamentally similar to one another. But Brazil approaches the genre in a uniquely psychological way. Sam Lowry is different from the standard protagonist who rebels against the government due to noble motives. He doesn't seem to have any larger goals than his own personal ones. He isn't trying to make the world a better place. He's only longing for a better life for himself, one more exciting and romantic than the humdrum existence he currently occupies, where he's beset by an overbearing mother, a pitiful boss, and a dull job. In the midst of this bureaucratic nightmare state, he cares only about such matters as getting his air conditioning fixed and stalking a female stranger who physically resembles his fantasy woman--or so he perceives. The woman, as played by Kim Greist, appears in his fantasies as a helpless damsel with long, flowing hair and a silky dress who sits in a cage while he battles a giant Samurai warrior. The real-life woman he pursues, also played by Greist, sports a butch haircut, drives a large truck, and has a cigarette dangling from the corner of her mouth.It's a testament to Pryce's performance that he commands our total sympathy the whole time. We feel for him and go along with the romantic adventure he attempts to create for himself. His nervous, stammering personality is one that would have been easy to overdo, yet Pryce strikes just the right note, especially as we begin questioning the character's sanity. At one point, another character tells him that You're paranoid; you've got no sense of reality. But who wouldn't be paranoid in such a setting? The scene brings to mind the old joke that goes You're not paranoid. Everyone really is out to get you. The movie inhabits such a whacky, surreal world full of strange people and sights that Sam Lowry almost seems sensible by comparison. Creating a character like this was a fresh, innovative twist on a genre that normally loses sight of human personalities.

While many of his best films are among the comedies that he directed for SNL alumni Belushi and Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy, An American Werewolf in London stands apart from those by casting David Naughton, Jenny Aguter, and Griffin Dunne in the parts- all practically unknowns then- and giving them some of the best kinds of genre roles imaginable. The two friends played by Naughton and Dunne are out on vacation, sort of, and they stumble upon a town loaded with superstition about wolves and other things. When Dunne gets killed and something, uh, peculiar happens to Naughton, it changes both of them- principally because Naughton keeps seeing Dunne, deteriorating throughout the rest of the film, even as he both turns into the werewolf (Beware the moon, David, beware the moon) and falls for a kind nurse played by Aguter. All three roles are realized well, though it might be prudent to put a lot of good will on the male leads, as they both go under Rick Baker's still show-stopping make-up jobs.This is the kind of production that could go in a few different directions, and for someone like Landis's skills it could've gone in those directions, either one, considering his background. It could have been a send-up much like his Kentucky Fried Movie. It could have been just dumb, pure camp like one of his lesser comedies of the 90s. But here he's really sticking to his guns to make it really believably scary, but also with a sly, coarse, and crude sense of humor about it. It's almost in tune to what would come a few years later with Ghostbusters, only without the mega-wit and overall mainstream appeal. It's a cult item that probably isn't seen by many as Landis's other films, yet I still remember things very well from the film years later, indelible things like the use of songs (obvious, sure, by 'moon' being all over the place, but everything from Van Morrison to CCR to the main Blue Moon theme used during the crossover are really dead-perfect for what's needed). Aside from the obvious make-up scenes, I remember being both freaked and delighted by the undead exchanges with David, especially when it finally reaches its purest absurdity in the movie theater scene.And even the ending, unlike other Landis films, is with a tinge of tragedy and sadness. This is not the ending a typical comedy director would bring, as by now we've really gotten on the side of David, the scorned protagonist turned bloody villain by way of a curse. Some of the scenes that end up cutting back to the old rural village, as I also remember it, were not my favorite scenes as they brought more of the superstitious stuff that is not necessarily needed. It's the bits with Naughton, with Dunne, and even with the lady of the film that make it worthwhile. It's fun but not too goofy or bad B-movie-like, and it's scary without being cheap. It's basically the finest synthesis yet from the filmmaker to combine his gory theatrics with his firm, cool sense of humor. It's also one of my favorite films of 1981.

If you watch both films, you'll see that Hawks more or less stole the plot for The Proud Ones, even though the films allegedly come from different written sources. The Webb film is much more psychologically nuanced, without all the male bonding with which Hawks litters his films. Rio Bravo is still wonderfully shot and acted, but it feels a bit like Hawks was running on empty creatively, as he actually remade this film yet again a few years later. Again with Wayne (older and less funny), but with Mitchum (okay but looking bored) and James Caan (dreadful) this time. Any mention of the Proud Ones and Rio Bravo would be incomplete without mentioning what a great actor Robert Ryan was. He projects confidence and controlled menace, whereas Wayne is all bluster. Just compare the annoying-jokey tone of the Wayne-Brennan scenes in Bravo to the silent knowing exchanges between Ryan-Brennan (old Walter pops up in almost every Western in those days) in the Proud Ones.
