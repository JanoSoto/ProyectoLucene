The 15 minutes of voice-over at the beginning was actually perhaps 45 seconds. I have no idea what he means by his Five Sections theory. It seems that he's not just geographically Out There.This movie needs to be four hours to really do the complexity of the subject justice. Nevertheless, what is presented here is compelling and complex. John Travolta is truly excellent as a chilly ambulance chaser who gradually turns to care--to the point of obsession-- about justice for the families whose children have been killed by careless chemical handling--it's amazing to think that if it hadn't been for Tarantino, Travolta never would have had this chance to blossom. Sadly, though, his transformation, while well shown, is never fully explained. The well-written script stays away from his making a speech about how he's changed, but without it his motivations remain obscure. As he begins to tip into obsession, we are distanced from him by this lack of real internal understanding. This is a problem.Robert Duvall is also just amazing-- it's wonderful to see Duvall and Travolta spar with each other-- as a lawyer intelligent and depersonalized beyond the point of caring about cases as happening between actual human beings. His character is incredibly complex, and his and Travolta's characters, and this film's examination of them, is the film's best feature.The story is compelling, but feels confined and crammed in-- this all but crushes the film as it tries to fit Travolta's post-trial years and the EPA case that ensues into the final ten minutes. It seems to want to leave viewers with a sense of redemption, since the case is finally won, but it suddenly goes so detail-less--when the previous 2 hours have been so rich-- that it just seems limp. A bad note to end the film on.I would have liked the film to focus more on the divergence between justice and the judiciary system, and &#4;Travolta's transformation. I thought this film would have LIKED to do what GORILLAS IN THE MIST did-- show how a righteous obsession can warp someone beyond the confines of reason-- but it doesn't, leaving the transformation a bit hollow.William Macy is excellent in his typical decent man driven to desperation role. Tony (Hot) Shaloub also stands out.I would go see this movie, I thought it was very good, and the acting excellent, I just wish we lived in the sort of box-office-gross-less universe where the money and interest would be there to tell this story with all the detail it deserves.Nevertheless, if Travolta and Duvall were nominated, it would seem very fair.--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies www.cinemademerde.com ","genre":null},{"date":"5 January 1999","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" First, let me say that the commentator from Antarctica who disliked this movie clearly saw a different movie than I did.

Such a movie is Shakespeare in Love, now out in limited release (you can check it out at smaller art houses, but arrive early to find a seat as every performance is selling out).The movie, written by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman and Directed by John Madden (amazing what he can do when he isn't commentating on football games ), has probably the wittiest dialogue and most original premise that I've seen in years  What would happen if Will were a struggling playwright with writer's block, who needs the inspiration of a muse to finish his first big play, tentatively titled Romeo and Ethel, the Pirates Daughter?  Enter lovely Gwyneth Paltrow as a poetry-struck noblewoman who yearns for the stage; she disguises herself as a boy to act in the new production, only to fall for the young poet himself.  But then, she has been engaged in a marriage of convenience to the well-titled but lightly-monied Lord Wessex, and the game is an-on.  What follows is a fascinating play of words, funny situations made more funny by their similarity to modern times (check out the waiter giving out the daily special at the restaurant - a scream), full-egoed actors fighting for better parts, producers just trying to keep the show going, and intricate Shakespearean changes of scene.  The writers and Director are to be commended for blending the best of the Bard's comedies and making them appealing and understandable to modern audiences. You'll have to watch this flick more than once to catch all the little Elizabethan in-jokes.The performances are good, with a great cast.  Joseph Fiennes (Ralph's little brother) puts in a good performance as the lovestruck poet, and Gwyneth Paltrow plays the muse beautifully (of course she could play anything 'beautifully' ;), then again, after Emma, if she played dead it would be an improvement.  But the real treat is in the supporting cast, Geoffrey Rush as the producer who believes it all works out in the nick of time by a miracle, Dame Judi Dench as the stern yet human Elizabeth Regina, Ben Affleck as an Elizabethan Tom Cruise with a cruiseship size ego.My only criticism although like most good stories the ending is eventually foretellable, it drags a bit.  Of course, considering that the writers were taking on one of the finest writers of all times, someone who understood that after standing for two or three hours the audience wanted a good, strong, quick resolution, the ending is fine, but not up to old Will's standards.

He, his wife (rather than his daughter- as written in Exodus) and their biological son Ramseses consider Moses to be a full member of their family and, rather than try to kill him after he killed the sadistic Egyptian torturing the Hebrew slave (as written in Exodus), they ALL plead with him to forget his Hebrew birth and remain in the palace as though NOTHING had changed (even to the degree that Ramseses and the Pharaoh both try to decree that Moses's killing the Egyptian had NOT happened).

REVENGE OF THE NERDS is a step above teen movies, and because it requires some ill-conceived R-rated trash. It could have been the other way around. The two nerds in glasses was what made this movie likeable and special in every way, plus their ability to rule over an opposing fraternity that humiliated them made it an entertaining pleasure. This one should have been less intent on its raunchiness, though. The satire is welcome, but the film goes way off course when we're treated to plenty of unneeded flatulence and feminine body parts. Much more attention to comedy elements would've flattened the impact down to minimum size. An O.K. movie for its own good, yet ANIMAL HOUSE is far better on laughs than this one offered.
