Directed by Brad Bird and scripted Tim McCanilies and Andy Brent Forrester, The Iron Giant is one of those rare animation animals that delights the kids as much as it does the watching adults. Tho the actual giant himself, with all his dazzling weaponry, is the star attraction on show, it's the iron colossus' inner conflict that gives the film its heart. Aided by his friend, young Hogarth, good old iron decides he doesn't want to be a big weapon, but the authorities, as is nearly always the way, just can't let it be. The unflinching attitude that ran thru many of the 50s sci-fi schlockers was one of being-because we don't understand it, lets destroy it-something that Ted Hughes and the film makers here capture perfectly. Sophisticated and intelligent in its approach and delivery, this is definitely one of the better animated film's from the modern age. 9\/10Voice work comes from Jennifer Anniston, Harry Connick Jr, Vin Diesel, James Gammon, Christopher McDonald, M.

If you thought 'Blade was a decent action flick, Blade 2 will blow your mind, proving effortlessly that it out does it's predecessor easily. WWWHy? Because one of the greatest directors has taken over Guillermo del Toro! Guillermo really gives the film the tone the first one lacked, in pretty much every aspect possible. The lighting is more eerie, the villains much more threatening, etc., etc. First off, I love the cast!! Wesley Snipes and Kristofferson both return, both a host of new characters arrive, much more lively and likable ones to add to this. Where as Norman Reedus' performance is top notch and Leonor Varela is sexy as hell, Ron Perlman!!He steals the show in my opinion with his fantastic performance. It is characters such as the Blood Pack that make this film much more enjoyable than the first. The sense of conflict of Blade working with his own enemies to defeat a bigger threat, while still having its light touches of humor, is great. David Goyer really out did himself here. The art direction is stunning, from The House of Pain to the sewers, everything really sets the mood of the film as a scary-comic book come to life. Luke Goss as Nomak is dope and this time the end fight is truly pulse pounding! The pacing is better and the action seems literally non-stop. Also, we dive deeper into Blade's inner demons as he begins to challenge his hatred of his own kind and the story is simply great here. And the score is even better, this time Marco Beltrami being the composer. Tradgic, emotional, chilling, the score delivers the right tone at the right time. Such as Nomak, as when the audience finds out his true origins, the music is sad and remorseful for him, rejected by his own father. Blade 2 is definitely one of my top hero flicks of all time!!

The other characters ridicule the idea of Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson as a couple, but almost entirely on the grounds of class--she is a widow from one of the old families of the town, living in an old house, while he is a gardener. But how many gardeners (he actually owns a nursery) live in a huge, gorgeous converted barn in the middle of rich, beautiful countryside (ie, a property that would now be worth several million dollars, and even then, because of the land, must have been worth much more than Wyman's old house)? Of course, the more incendiary reasons for everyone's disapproval are age, sex, and money. There are only a very few, very brief, and very discreet allusions to these. Wyman never behaves in a sensual manner or trades her prim, tailored, buttoned-up clothes for anything more womanly, even though we see her having a good time at a party given by the only people in town who are jolly and informal and allow non-Wasps into their homes as guests rather than servants. Neither of Wyman's children says a word about their discomfiture that she plans to marry such a young, handsome, and, as far as they know, virile man as Rock Hudson--though, as we now know, children of whatever age are embarrassed by knowing that their parents are sexually active--even with each other. Nor do they mention their displeasure at the fact that, when she dies, their inheritance will be shared with a much younger widower (they are not troubled at the idea of her marrying a man old enough to predecease her and therefore not cut into their share).Not only was Hudson, as we now know, poor casting for an ardent lover of a woman, he is given a personality that makes him asexual and too good to be real. In their dialogues about Wyman's fears that her children and the townspeople will shun her, he is always wise and calm, despite being much younger than she, and always has a loving, sensible, word of advice. He acts so much like a guru or priest that he becomes desexualised as he takes on the role of a detached, all-knowing observer of life. In real life, surely a young man, one who knew he was antagonising all the townspeople (his customers), would be nervous and insecure and would be angry at Wyman for taking the attitude that all the risk and sacrifice were hers. She would seem to be too old to have children--doesn't he want any? Wyman claims to have been seventeen when she married, which, since she has two children in college, would make her at most 38. Yet she looks at least seven years older. I assumed this was Hollywood's typical flattery of its star, but looked her up afterwards and she WAS 38! It just shows how those hideous, prissy clothes and hairstyles of the period made women look much older than they were, as if youth was in itself an embarrassment. (Many women, ten or twenty years later, actually looked younger than they did in the Fifties because of the change in styles.) But everything that makes this a poor movie in conventional terms makes it fascinating as a document--not, perhaps, of what Americans were like in the Fifties but of what they believed, or at least wanted to believe or felt they should believe. After deciding not to marry Hudson, Wyman has terrible headaches, which her doctor diagnoses as her body taking revenge (though of course the word sex is not mentioned). This movie conveys, in its every aspect, the pain caused at that time by hypocrisy and repression. In emotional moments, the music rises to cue our feelings, a lot of slushy strings, poor-man's Tchaikovsky. The colours and lighting are often harsh and lurid--in one scene in a bedroom in Wyman's house, what looks like fluorescent light illuminates a headache-making blue-and-orange colour scheme. Everything is artificial and confining while pretending to be natural and realistic.It is hardly surprising that this awful decade, in which most people in serious movies seemed to be having a walking nervous breakdown, was followed by the let-it-all-hang-out Sixties. All that repression and dishonesty finally exploded, some of it into cleansing honesty and passion, some into hysteria and chaos.There's some more hypocrisy in the title, though only for those knowledgeable about seventeenth-century literature. The title seems to refer to untrammeled, raging passion. It makes one think of the phrase everything under the sun. Yet, though it comes from a poem by one of the most famous libertines in history, the Earl of Rochester, it treats passion lightly, even contemptuously. The rakish speaker of the poem tells his lover not to nag him about being unfaithful to her or breaking his promises, saying that if he can manage for even a minute to concentrate on her and only her, 'tis all that heaven allows, because that's how men are.It makes one wonder whether the filmmakers gave the film this tile in all innocence, just thinking it was an exciting and romantic phrase, or whether they used it knowingly, as an inside joke, to imply that Rock Hudson isn't going to be faithful to Jane Wyman after they get together--that, perhaps, the excitement for him is in winning rather than having her, making a conquest of someone thought to be above him.

Here is a story which is executed with enough intelligence to be both original and scary. Any horror film which can accomplish those two things (and not many can) is unlikely to be a bad film. Candyman draws you in with its strange storytelling and a deep ambiance, not to mention a handful nail-biting scary moments. From what I've described, you'd think nothing could go wrong with Candyman, unfortunately something does. A large middle portion of the movie seems to stray a little too far from the central plot line. Things get stagnant when they should be moving. As a result, Candyman is not quite the film it could've been, but it'll offer enough creativity to impress any horror fans who haven't yet seen it.College student Helen Lyle wants to do a project on the urban legend of the Daniel Robitaille (a.k.a. the Candyman). If you look in a mirror and say his name five times, he will appear, tall and sinister with his bloody hook hand and his bee eaten, rib exposed chest. While Helen searches for the candyman, she starts to realize that he is after her as well. The question is why?The first half hour of Candyman is an ideal example of good horror filmaking, but a couple of strange plot twists set the stage for a somewhat plodding middle section in which not a lot happens. The Candyman has perhaps a little too much screen time, and a lot of his lines are repetitious. He feels far more threatening off-screen than he does on-screen, except for the moments where he appears out of nowhere, those are scary. The climax also feels a little weird, What happens to our protagonist is quite dramatic, but doesn't seem to make much sense. At least there are no major clichés. The way Candyman ends, it is obvious they did not have a sequel in mind, but as is too often the case there is not one but two follow ups to this strange and eccentric film. Candyman is good enough to make you consider watching the next film. It succeeds in a number of other places too, the most important of which is scaring the audience, but I think it needs a little more work, just a little.

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"18 July 2009","score":"","review":" Cult horror films are almost always dismissed by the masses as junk for the weak of mind, but some of them like Candyman actually accomplish something. Here is a story which is executed with enough intelligence to be both original and scary. Any horror film which can accomplish those two things (and not many can) is unlikely to be a bad film. Candyman draws you in with its strange storytelling and a deep ambiance, not to mention a handful nail-biting scary moments. From what I've described, you'd think nothing could go wrong with Candyman, unfortunately something does. A large middle portion of the movie seems to stray a little too far from the central plot line. Things get stagnant when they should be moving. As a result, Candyman is not quite the film it could've been, but it'll offer enough creativity to impress any horror fans who haven't yet seen it.College student Helen Lyle wants to do a project on the urban legend of the Daniel Robitaille (a.k.a. the Candyman). If you look in a mirror and say his name five times, he will appear, tall and sinister with his bloody hook hand and his bee eaten, rib exposed chest. While Helen searches for the candyman, she starts to realize that he is after her as well. The question is why?The first half hour of Candyman is an ideal example of good horror filmaking, but a couple of strange plot twists set the stage for a somewhat plodding middle section in which not a lot happens. The Candyman has perhaps a little too much screen time, and a lot of his lines are repetitious. He feels far more threatening off-screen than he does on-screen, except for the moments where he appears out of nowhere, those are scary. The climax also feels a little weird, What happens to our protagonist is quite dramatic, but doesn't seem to make much sense. At least there are no major clichés. The way Candyman ends, it is obvious they did not have a sequel in mind, but as is too often the case there is not one but two follow ups to this strange and eccentric film. Candyman is good enough to make you consider watching the next film. It succeeds in a number of other places too, the most important of which is scaring the audience, but I think it needs a little more work, just a little.

A masterpiece too because of the three sons entirely entrusted to their ex-officer of a father because of the running away of the mother who could not stand the cold winters of Montana and was afraid of grizzly bears, that loving friendly species of furry animals more or less the cousins of our home-friendly teddy bears. Then the eldest son goes to the city of his mother to study and comes back with a fiancée, but it is 1914 and the three sons can only follow their patriotic call to go and fight in Europe on the English side. The father is furious but nothing can stop that call of the wild. The picture of the first world war is dramatic when you see these British soldiers running to the German lines with simple rifles and no helmets when the Germans have machine guns, helmets of course and gas masks against their poisonous gases. The eldest son is killed and the youngest son does what an old Indian rite tells him to do. He gets the heart of his brother out and eventually sends it back to his father for it to be buried in due place. Then he gets his Indian colors on his face and goes out to kill and scalp two German machine-gun operators, two of your teeth for one of my teeth. The middle son, wounded on one leg, is sent home and the younger son eventually comes back home. The real stake of the film then is Susanna, the fiancée of the elder son who was killed in the war. She was in love before the departure of the three brothers and still is after the war with the younger son, a wild but thrilling personality. A competition between the two surviving brothers starts then. Susanna chooses the younger one, but his wild side, what the Indian story teller calls his bear side, calls him away and he yields to that call and leaves the ranch for several years in order to discover the world and conquer his thirst, hunger and even his ravenous greed for the unknown and the savage. When he comes back Susanna has gone to the middle brother who has become a congressman in the meantime. The younger son, Justin, then accepts the situation and marries the daughter of the main family working on the ranch, from an Indian mother and an American father. He will get two children from her but he will try to compete with the prohibition traffickers who have the full support of the local sheriff. That will lead to a drama, the death of his wife, then his vengeance as soon as he is out of prison, on bail I suspect, and the attempt of the main moonshiner with the help of the sheriff to come and kill that rebellious man. And there the plot thickens and from dramatic we jump to tragic. And the main character of the story all get the ends they deserve, the middle brother, the younger brother, Susannah, the father and all the others, including the local moonshiner and his police friends. The end of the younger brother, in 1963 mind you, is absolutely brilliant. Add to that very strong story the beautiful and breathtaking landscape and mountains of Montana and you really enjoy every single scene. And after it all, when the last die is thrown on the marble of the tombstone you keep in mind the strong images about the first world war and the no less strong discourse of the father against all kinds of war that are declared bad by principle. Are they really bad by principle? Is there nothing to save a war now and then? For this film certainly not, and that is the fault of the politicians who are ready to do any kind of profitable maneuver to keep their juicy positions in government.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID ","genre":null},{"date":"18 July 2009","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" A masterpiece in its genre, post Indian war frontier films, Montana in that case.

Values are so much degraded that we cannot distinguish between right and wrong anymore. It's the story of a captain who during the Vietnam war is sent on a special mission aimed at killing a former American colonel who went insane and left the army to go into the jungle in Cambodia where he formed a private army with local tribesmen and went on fighting the war on his own making lots of atrocities. Horror is more or less his motto and his obsession. Besides that he is also a poet and a philosopher and this feature of his discourse fits well in his behaviour. The movie develops itself by showing the course of the captain on his way to colonel Kurz's stronghold on a small Navy boat up a river through the jungle. During that course he and the crew of the boat find themselves involved in several happenings showing the true face of war, some violent and some delirious like for instance in the beginning the attack of helicopters against a Vietcong position by the sea, accompanied by Wagner's The Valkyria commanded by a crazy Cavalry colonel insisting of surfing on the sea while bombs explode everywhere around; another delirious scene is when the boat on its course arrives to an army post where there is a musical show for the soldiers performed by a few Playboy bunnies coming from USA who in the end have to seek sudden refuge in the helicopter that had brought them to avoid being molested if not raped. Another curious but full of meaning sequence is when the boat arrives to an old plantation owned by a French family who refuses to leave despite the war. The conversation at dinner between the family members and the captain is rather interesting to follow showing how differently French and Americans faced the war going on there. The movie is well directed and well performed by the whole cast and Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurz who appears only in the end is not better than the rest.

It's a movie that simply tells the story of average normal people, with real-life feelings and emotions.I call this movie a little drama since it's a British movie, made without a big budget or any big stars in it, though Trevor Howard became a well known name later in his career. It's also a movie set at limited locations and it of course is mostly set at the train station and its small café.Kind of ironic that this movie got directed by David Lean, who would later make many great big epics, such as The Bridge on the River Kwai, Doctor Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia.It's a nicely directed movie, that keeps things going, without ever getting sentimental or over-the-top with any of its emotions.

What Farina doesn't realize is that Travolta is a stone movie freak and is converted by the seductive movie-making atmosphere of L.A. from a semi-hit man into a would-be producer. The money that Travolta intends to invest may still be sitting in that gym bag in LAX, surrounded by ill-disguised DEA agents who are waiting for someone to try to get it, but everyone knows the money exists and they treat it as if it's not just real, which it is, but readily available, which it's not.It reminds me of the fiscal situation on Yap, an island in Micronesia. The Yapese have a kind of money too. Huge stones, laboriously carved out of a mountain on a distant island and carefully shaped, then shipped hundreds of miles to Yap. In one case, a monstrously heavy stone fell from the canoe offshore and fell to the bottom of the ocean. But it was still counted as being in circulation because, after all, all the Yapese had seen it and knew it was there.The story in this movie is more complicated and involves a dozen or more characters, all of whom would love to get their hands on that money. Some want to use it to make a lousy movie -- with Travolta cheer leading this contingent -- and others want it because they figure it belongs to them. Some die but no one mourns them. The deaths may be richly comic.What makes it possible for us to enjoy this story of bullying, threats, violence, greed, lust, and murder is its cheerful acceptance of the philosophical propositions of moral nihilism.When Travolta is confronted by a muscle man, James Gandolfini, he kicks him in the shin and sucker punches him without adumbrating the act. When Gandolfini hits the ground, groaning in pain, we can afford to laugh at it because the values behind the movie have given us permission to do it. Travolta squats next to the supine figure and begins chatting with him about the movies in which he's been a stunt man. Sixty movies. Oh, yeah? asks Chili, which ones? And Gandolfini modestly begins mentioning some, dismissing their quality over Travolta's objections. The two chat as if the assault had never taken place.Nothing is good or bad but thinking makes it so, said Hamlet. We're on the side of Travolta, of course, because he's the unpretentious hero captivated by movies, just like the rest of us, but a guy who can handle himself too. And he convinces us, just as he convinces the others, that an entertaining movie can be made from this lousy script he's come into possession of. He cares nothing about other people, just movies. But at least he cares for movies. That's good in a film like this. It's constructive and Travolta's motive is passion. The bad guys just simply want the money because it's coming to them, and in some cases they're right. The Latino gang has taken a risk by shipping the drugs into the USA. They have a legitimate claim to it because, as one of the four factors of production, the entrepreneurs, they've earned it. They may be right but they're still bad in this context.The friendships and affairs mirror the moral nihilism of the other narrative strands. Nobody's in love. Nobody really cares deeply about anybody else. Allegiances shift like the wind. Betrayals are commonplace. And it's all so boldly stated that it comes out amusing.The dialog is pretty sharp and the characters well observed. The egocentricity of celebrities and the rich and powerful is used for laughs. Tiny Danny DeVito sits down at an al fresco café and orders the waitress to bring an omelet, but it has to be made with only egg whites, and the shallots have to be only slightly browned -- not too much -- and then he leaves before it arrives. When an acquaintance addresses him as Marty, DeVito smiles in a friendly way, nods, and corrects him -- Martin.Dennis Farina arrives at LAX, strides purposefully to the sidewalk, arriving at a right angle to the curb. A taxi sits a few feet away to his left. Without looking, silently, Farina snaps his fingers and the driver pulls up until the rear door is directly in front of his fare. The cab driver is a non-person to Farina. So is everyone else, to everyone else, except to the extent that they can be useful.It's a movie that's almost completely without heart.
