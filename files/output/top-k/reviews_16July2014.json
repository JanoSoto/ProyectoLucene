[{"date":"16 July 2014","score":"","review":" The word 'auteur' is French for 'author', essential the idea behind auteur theory is that a filmmaker exercises an authorship over his\/her work as if they were a novelist. This results in their work always consisting of a stylistic, technical or narrative signature that is unique to them, allowing the audience when watching a film to instantly be able know who directed it. Since the dawn of cinema, we have had the pleasure of witnessing many auteur's doing what they do best, which is making films that are unique and inherently them; may it be Hitchcock and his ever present big twists or Tarantino and his hyper violent nonlinear narratives. But in this modern day, only one filmmaker working do I really feel optimisers the word auteur the best, which is Wes Anderson and if you read my Moonlight Kingdom review you will know I'm a massive fan. Forget Moonlight Kingdom or Royal Tenenbaums, because Rushmore in particular ranks as my all time favourite Anderson film. Every school has them, that one kid who seems to have at least 40 hours a day, while the rest of us mere mortals only have 24 to wrestle with. Then not just seemingly having more hours than the rest of us, this one kid is also able to achieve and do so much more in a week then most people do in a life time. Rushmore has one and his name is Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), an obnoxious, precocious 15 year old who is just about involved in every extracurricular clubs known to man; it could be as dull as competitive box packing club, as pointless as a hopping backwards whilst blindfolded club or even as impossible as a synchronised diving whilst playing the violin club. If there is a club, I can guarantee that not only is Max Fischer the president of that club, but was probably the found of it to. But you're thinking with all that extracurricular activity, how would he have time to do well academically also? Well even the extraordinary Max Fischer can't be a part of all those clubs and still get straight A's, his failing and is in the danger of being kicked of Rushmore, which promises to make a lot of people happy, including the head teacher himself, the school bully and his once pint sized friend now turned bitter enemy . Then when you thought that was harsh on him, to top it all off, he has to compete for the affection of the beautiful yet quaint teacher Rosemary (Olivia Williams), with his much older, idol and best friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who also just happens to be a millionaire too. Sounds like trying to sink the Titanic with an ice cube or trying to accurately measure how tall Mount Everest is with a 6 inch ruler; basically what I'm trying to say is things seem pretty impossible for Max to able to both win the girl and stay at Rushmore too. But this is Max Fischer we're talking about! He can't even spell the word failure &#x96; no literally he can't, he flunked English too. Being only Anderson's second feature after Bottle Rocket, you can forgive Rushmore hasn't quite got the same Picasso-esk cinematography, that with its rich, vibrant and bright textures is so effortlessly able to set each scene a blaze with colour, that is beautifully demonstrated in his later films like Moonrise or The Grand Budapest Hotel. However Rushmore still possesses Andersons flair for creating seemingly perfect and coherent characters on the surface, but when you actually venture under the glossy finishes, you realise they are more mad, crazy and dysfunctional then you could ever imagine. And it's for that very reason why I loved the characters of Herman and Max so adamantly, who while on the surface seem so dissimilar; Max being so pronounced and well put together while Herman on other hand is always a car crash waiting to happen, but deep down they are just lonely souls seeking the honest feeling of love and acceptance. My favourite sequence of theirs was when they were trying to sabotage each other; Max by putting bees in Herman's hotel room and then Herman in retaliation destroying Max's bike. The sequence was so imaginative and provided a shed load of many great laughs, reminding me greatly of Tom and Jerry. What I also love about Wes Anderson, is that he never gets lazy when it comes to characterising his supporting characters, they are always so dynamic, unique and if we were to follow their lives instead, it will also make for a great movie. When it comes to picking the best supporting characters, it's so difficult because they all have such compelling personalities and idiosyncrasies, there is Max's father who is a barber but is always strangely mistaken for a neurosurgeon, there is the bully with the really thick Scottish accent and then there is Dirk who is so adorable that he puts Macaulay Culkin in Home alone to shame. Empire was right when it ranked Rushmore in the top 200 films of all time, because I'm in no doubt that Wes Anderson's banger should be on everyone's bucket lists of films to watch.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"16 July 2014","score":"","review":" Once upon a time in the 1930's, a legendary pairing of two stars took place in the midst of the Great Depression. Keep in mind that this era was a trying time for America due to the fact that many people were either broke or starving to death. What made this pairing so special is that they helped many people forget for a brief period of time that they were living in such an era. That pairing is none other than that of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Though Astaire would later star in other memorable musicals such as The Band Wagon (1953) and narrate the Christmas special Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town (1970), this team was probably best known by many for their collaboration on musical-comedies such as Swing Time (1936) and Top Hat (1935), the latter being the subject of this very review. Top Hat follows American dancer Jerry Travers (Fred Astaire) who travels to London to do a show for producer Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton). One night when practicing his dance routine in Hardwick's hotel room, a lady named Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers) from the room below comes up to complain about the noise he's making. Immediately falling in love with Dale on their first meeting, Jerry is determined to pursue her all over town to win her affections. But things get complicated when Dale mistakes Jerry for Hardwick, who is married to Dale's friend Madge (Helen Broderick), and Dale gets engaged to Italian fashion designer Alberto Beddini (Erik Rhodes). So Jerry gets Hardwick and his butler Bates (Eric Blore) to help him with winning back Dale. Basically, the plot centers on a new couple that must try to clear up a big misunderstanding that has come between them. To be brutally honest, the plots have never been the primary strength of the musicals Astaire and Rogers made during that time. In fact, I can see why this story in particular might annoy moviegoers today as it's the type of plot found in rom-coms that most people hate. Because of the fact that the story centers on a misunderstanding, the couple apparently have to be convinced that they hate each other throughout most of the film (Though to be fair, I don't think Astaire hated Rogers at all). And as a result, we have trouble being convinced that they'd be a happy couple. Given that the ability to be convinced that a couple is in love is a crucial ingredient to make a romantic story work, the negative comments regarding the plot to Top Hat are justified in that sense. The story is awkward to say the least. But in terms of its execution, it could have been a lot worse. The aspects that truly sell the musicals starring Astaire and Rogers, especially this one, are the musical numbers and the dancing. Film critic Roger Ebert really opened my eyes in his Great Movies review of Swing Time regarding what made Astaire and Rogers stand out. Ebert stated that Astaire believed every dance number should be filmed, as nearly as possible, in one unbroken take, always showing the full figures of the dancers from head to toes. There are no cutaways to an admiring audience--Astaire thought that was a distraction. No cuts, or very few, to different points of view. And no closeups of the dancer's faces, for that would deny us the movement of their bodies. When you see anyone--an athlete, a musician, a dancer, a craftsman--doing something difficult and making it look easy and a joy, you feel enhanced. It is a victory for the human side, over the enemies of clumsiness, timidity and exhaustion. To briefly summarize Ebert's brilliantly chosen words, Astaire and Rogers stood out from other talented dancers in Hollywood because they realized that little to no editing resulted in more convincing dancing. By using this minimal editing approach, we can truly appreciate the stamina and talent that Astaire and Rogers had as dancers and thus make the illusion seem more real to us. Remember the Isn't It A Lovely Day number early on in the film? The minimal editing used in that number captures the illusion that Rogers truly is progressing from a slow to fast dance alongside Astaire. As a result, the transformation of Rogers' character's opinion of Astaire's character during that song feels more complete. The dance sequences in the Cheek to Cheek and Piccolino musical numbers also obtain the illusion that they've been dancing for a certain period of time without interruptions. It's a smart strategy that Astaire and Rogers use for their dance sequences, so I give them full credit for that. Pet peeves with the narrative aside, Astaire and Rogers still have some likability to them. The exchange between them at the start of the picture (when Rogers complains about Astaire's noisy dancing) shows this teaming at their best and summarizes the chemistry between them in a nutshell. Rogers has some smart yet playful verbal jabs and Astaire always seems to maintain positivity even when the going gets tough (usually when certain people want him to go away). The songs by Irving Berlin stand the test of time, namely Isn't It A Lovely Day, Top Hat, Cheek to Cheek and Piccolino. The dancing between our two leads is amazing because of how they maintain pleasure even under pressing circumstances (wardrobe troubles, hours and hours of rehearsal, etc.). Top Hat is the type of picture you don't see being made today. I wouldn't say that it's going to be for everybody in today's world. But considering the time it was made, it's nothing short of a miracle.

Although I do feel this is maybe slightly overrated, it is still good and so I couldn't not recommended this to people to watch. It has actors who blossomed in the future to stardom and actors who even in this and it's crazy going's on, still give a great performance. I felt this was strongly pretty good and here below is why so.The story is pretty scattered and new things happen constantly all the time but within it all it can be pretty funny and also a good old fun high school film with typical characters we see a lot, although not overly dramatic like we so often see. I wasn't so keen on the end and it could be said it gets dull although it still stays fresh as it isn't a long film really. I think also it's chilled nature makes it easily watchable and anyone(of course over 18) can actually enjoy this, albeit not containing the most exciting of scenes.Jason London contributes to that chilled nature in the film and he keeps it very watchable, I also liked Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey's contributions as they are so angry and also chilled respectively and make this film much more watchable from the outset. I wasn't overall to keen on the acting front but it stays steady, some characters may seem a bit too wild and not fit in right but it is just like any other high school movie.Richard Linklater does this to in my opinion, not his best, although he certainly does it well and his great directing and writing shine in parts to make this film better as it goes along. I think writing wise it could have been better but he pretty much directs it perfectly and a screenplay to match could have made this one of his if not one of THE best films around. I liked the thrilling parts which usually have nice sets used and the suburban backdrop where they run amok is pretty nice too to see.My main negative point has to be the lack of comedy, it is classed as a kind of drama\/comedy but really lacks laughs wise, you really have to have been like these lot at school to really enjoy it. As said also before, the acting, not bad as I also said but it harms it at times and even it could be said that certain people are hard to actually understand when they are either drunk as hell or blazed out of their minds on some drugs.Recommend it to people who like drug fuelled adventure but also anyone who enjoys a good high school film, maybe lacks the comedy we see so often in that genre but still has the same spirit throughout. I could just say, high schoolers go watch this, but I think this one really is for adults too, not just those who grew up in the 70's but also anyone who really likes a fun film that doesn't out stay it's welcome.Overall it is Strongly Pretty Good and it could be said it is kind of near being just Good. Any fan of Linklater may be hugely proud of him when they watch it, it is a good watch for his fans and his work never seems to let him down really. I think to say it was made quite a bit ago now and it still remains a cult film really shows just how much of an effect this film can lay down and also, just how much you can really enjoy it also.

I wasn't overall to keen on the acting front but it stays steady, some characters may seem a bit too wild and not fit in right but it is just like any other high school movie.Richard Linklater does this to in my opinion, not his best, although he certainly does it well and his great directing and writing shine in parts to make this film better as it goes along. I think writing wise it could have been better but he pretty much directs it perfectly and a screenplay to match could have made this one of his if not one of THE best films around. I liked the thrilling parts which usually have nice sets used and the suburban backdrop where they run amok is pretty nice too to see.My main negative point has to be the lack of comedy, it is classed as a kind of drama\/comedy but really lacks laughs wise, you really have to have been like these lot at school to really enjoy it. As said also before, the acting, not bad as I also said but it harms it at times and even it could be said that certain people are hard to actually understand when they are either drunk as hell or blazed out of their minds on some drugs.Recommend it to people who like drug fuelled adventure but also anyone who enjoys a good high school film, maybe lacks the comedy we see so often in that genre but still has the same spirit throughout. I could just say, high schoolers go watch this, but I think this one really is for adults too, not just those who grew up in the 70's but also anyone who really likes a fun film that doesn't out stay it's welcome.Overall it is Strongly Pretty Good and it could be said it is kind of near being just Good.

Although I do feel this is maybe slightly overrated, it is still good and so I couldn't not recommended this to people to watch. It has actors who blossomed in the future to stardom and actors who even in this and it's crazy going's on, still give a great performance. I felt this was strongly pretty good and here below is why so.The story is pretty scattered and new things happen constantly all the time but within it all it can be pretty funny and also a good old fun high school film with typical characters we see a lot, although not overly dramatic like we so often see.

Notable Acting I will just say that Kevin J. O'Connor has to be one of my favourite actors when he plays that quirky coward character. Mainly because he plays the role so well and he plays off Treat Williams' character perfect, in a buddy criminal type sense. It is really fun to watch. We Studi plays the head mercenary and he looks like he really enjoyed his role as he is really going all out with it. The rest of his team however feel like they are just standard goons with no noticeable acting traits Noticeable Camera work Jut before the titles role on, we get what seems to be a POV shot from the prospective of the monster which is good, follow by a birds eye shot of the boat straight after the titles. The framing of shots is nicely done, this is something that I find a lot of movies doing, such as looking at the crew from behind as they walk through the door and the next shot as them walking towards the camera out of the door. Good framing comes from movies which aren't all that creative with their angles, but know it, so they make up for it with good framing.Graphics The monster isn't all too real, but it is great for 90's standards of movie monster. That is pretty much all I can say on the matter of that. Incorrect Science If all of the other computers were infected by the virus and taken down, I have a feeling the radar wouldn't be left working. The monster of the movie is an off shoot of a priapulid (Penis shaped worm) called Ottoia, this species went extinct 550 million years ago in the mid Cambrian era. They would only grow to 10 maximum, nowhere near the size of one shown in the movie. It is said they grew to obtuse sizes in the deep sea trenches. This is also wrong, mainly for the fact they were were native to shallow reef areas, because this is where they would hide in the sand in wait of their prey. But they did the method of feeding correct, eat prey and digest it before spitting out the indigestible features such as bones or shells. The elevator fall is too long and would have them falling thousands of feet if it was long. There is a scene at the end where John is looking under the hood of the jetski at the engine, but most jetski models have the engine under the seat. Overall Feel This movie was made by Stephen Sommers and was a year before he would go and direct the 'Mummy' franchise, which also has Kevin J. O'Connor in the first movie as well, playing an almost identical role to this one. This is one of those horror creature feature movies, which is a perfect blend of horror and action, but also has that element of cheesy horror in it as well.

People were wondering if the Harry Potter's books by J.K Rowling could easily be translated into the big screen. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone AKA Sorcerer's Stone directed by Chris Columbus, indeed show that it was somewhat possible. The story follows Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)'s first year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry as he discovers his gift and destiny against the dark forces of magic. The movie like the other films are cut into two plots directions. One is about student life at Hogwarts during the school-year, while the other half is about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. It works well as a long read novel, but in movie form its means a long sit through. The movie pacing is so long. It takes forever to get to the main plot of Harry Potter finding the Philosopher Stone. There are is a lot of filler scenes that could be cut away. I dislike how the Philosopher Stone is one-time movie McGuffin. For the best of my knowledge, the Philosopher stone plays no factor after this movie, and never mention again after this film. The third act, mostly comes out of nowhere. The twist toward the end, was pretty predictable, if you readt the books, but pretty interesting. Another thing about the movie is how non-logical the movie is. It really baffled me, how much exposition, it needed. Even an hour in the film, there were a lot of random odd things happening without much explaining. It gets more confusing as long bits of the book, like the Centaur showing in the woods, were shorten in the film. It gets worst for the centaur, as he wouldn't play a factor, in any of the later films, despite, saving Harry Potter from Voldermort. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) was also cut short. Her riddle solving in the book was cut from the film. Several minor characters have been removed from the film version, as well. Despite those, the movie is really close to the novel. In my opinion, don't bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. Still, there were some really dumb things to nitpick here like why would Professor Dumbledore (Richard Harris), even allow Harry Potter to stay with the Dursley's family when he knows that they're horrible people. Honestly, the Dursleys could had killed Harry Potter with the childhood neglect! What was he thinking? Harry Potter could had commit suicide, or gone crazy like Lord Voldermort! What an idiot! The whole movie is about children being danger all the time. I don't care if they're wizards in training, I'm surprise that the death tolls of students dying isn't as high as it should be. The school staff is questionable at times.

I think, children are a lot smarter than the childish message, the film is trying to pull. The acting in the movie is pretty bland, for the most part. After all, most of the child actors had this film as their first roles. I wouldn't say that Harry Potter's film series, have the most entertaining of dialogues, anyways. The wooden delivery, felt like a read-through. Most of what they're saying are stating the obvious or repeating what happening on screen. It's so annoying. The other actors were master British thespians, who seem to over-act at times. A good example of this is John Hurt & Alan Rickman. It was too hammy for already over the top world. The action scenes were pretty well-done. My favorite had to be the Quidditch match and the whole chess game. I can do, without the whole troll scene. The CGI troll hasn't aged well. Visually, the movie is beautiful to look at. I love the special effects, locations & set, and costume, they did. It really made the Harry Potter world, stand out. The music by John Williams is amazing to listen to. I think director Chris Columbus was indeed the best choice for this first movie, as he got the magically part, right and how to make a family picture. You even see, how much things, he establish that other directors would reused time after time. Still, I really hope for Terry Gilliam like J.K Rowling's first choice to be the direction. The movie has great social commentary themes like the metaphor of racism, ethnic cleansing and why Nazism is bad. You can also see possible influences from other words, that made Harry Potter work. There was a few controversial moments leading up to the film, like religious debates. A few religious groups claim that Harry Potter contain occult or Satanic subtexts that isn't good for children. Another one is the use of the word, sorcerer over the word philosopher in the title. US & British have different meanings to the words, plus marketing though, it would better to call it sorcerer as that word get more appeal. Due to this different, all scenes that mention the philosopher's stone by name had to be reshot, once with the actors saying philosopher's and once with sorcerer's. Overall The movie might has its flaws, but majority, a great first watch for any fantasy fan.

I dislike how the Philosopher Stone is one-time movie McGuffin. For the best of my knowledge, the Philosopher stone plays no factor after this movie, and never mention again after this film.

Dormer and Eckhart are assisted by rookie officer Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank). This particular homicide case is far from straight forward as the killer has taken many precautions and does his best not to leave any clues - this in part is down to the killer being a 'crime writer' so it kind of makes him an unofficial expert. Dormer is starting to piece the puzzle together, but there is an unfortunate twist in the tale which forces Dormer to co-operate with the killer. Will Dormer be able to get his man whilst also managing to keep his reputation and integrity intact? I'll admit that this film was a little slow to get moving, but there were several things working in its favour. Firstly, there is the great chemistry between Al Pacino and Martin Donovan. Pacino can do this sort of acting role in his sleep (no pun intended) and his reputation really does proceed him. I'm not quite as familiar with Martin Donovan, but he was good and the back and forth between him and Pacino was top drawer. The film is also interesting from a scientific perspective - there is a scene in the film where they are discussing going to school to interrogate a potential suspect and one of the Alaskan officers says we can't go now it's 10 o'clock and Dormer says So what? The Alaskan officers then inform him that it is in fact 10 o clock at night even though it is broad daylight outside - this isn't a plot hole btw. This is known as 'The Midnight Sun' and is witnessed in parts of Russia, Finland and Sweden and Alaska - it only occurs during the Summer months. I believe that the original film was set in Norway where the same phenomenon occurs.Insomnia starts off as a Crime\/Mystery film and it does maintain this theme throughout the film. However, once Walter Finch (Robin Williams) is introduced the film switches tone and becomes more of a psychological thriller. I liked the change of tone and found the psychological mind games that Finch plays with Dormer to be very entertaining and somewhat creepy. Williams is great in his role as the psychologically disturbed Walter Finch. It's not often that you can say that Al Pacino ends up being 'out acted' but I really felt that Williams stole the show. Pacino was still good, but Williams excelled in his role.Unfortunately, whilst this build up was good and Williams character was both disturbing and interesting I just found that once all this was established the film didn't really have anywhere to go. Insomnia plays its hand early by revealing that Finch was the killer - in some ways I liked it because it proved to be engaging and an extremely good psychological battle of wits. The downside of this is that it also made the film far too predictable - why couldn't there have been a few suspects throughout the film in order to keep the audience guessing? There were no plot twists and far less suspense than there could have been. Insomnia felt very clinical and by the numbers with very few (if any surprises).Even though Insomnia is a film with lots of flaws, it is still a good film and is worth watching (but more for the psychological aspect rather than the crime\/mystery aspect). I only realised that this was a remake after I'd watched this version so having enjoyed the remake I'll be sure to check out the original.

The Brave Little Toaster is a gem of creativity from a team of Disney animators independently of their corporate masters which never got the release it so richly deserves. Thanks to its smart writing, near-perfect direction, a glowing voice cast, and not half-bad animation, Toaster is cooked to the right shade of entertainment. In an isolated summer cabin, five anthropomorphic household appliances (a toaster, a vacuum, a desk lamp, a radio, and an electric blanket) wait forlornly in anticipation for the return of The Master, a little boy whom they formed a bond with before his 2,000 day disappearance with his family. Fed up with waiting, Toaster (outstandingly voiced by Deanna Oliver) decides its time for them to set out toward the City of Light to find him. Their journey includes the stuff of adventure including appliance mutilation at a parts shop, a waterfall, evil modern appliances, and a sadistic junkyard magnet. Along the way, they learn to deal with their differences and band together to get home.This film, based from the novella by Thomas M. Disch, was originally a vehicle for a young animator's directorial debut. That animator was John Lasseter, who sought to combine 2-D characters on a computer background in-house at Disney. Unfortunately, Disney's films were in the malaise era, therefore it's penny-pinching management pulled the plug on the project and fired Lasseter from his job. The project was then taken to independent studio Hyperion, where it ended up in the hands of Lasseter's good friends, animators Jerry Rees (Tron) and Joe Ranft (later Pixar writer) who transformed the novella into a smart screenplay that, unlike Disney, wasn't afraid to take risks with its imagery or ideas. Despite a budget that is practically an eighth of what it takes to produce decent animation, the heart and creativity gives it that special edge.What sets this film apart from other animated films during that time, and even some features nowadays is the way Rees and Ranft got a handle on their characters. Just like the finest work at Pixar (where Lasseter and Ranft expanded on these achievements even more) each character has a special personality, and has the voice cast to match. The cast includes great voice actors and some great comedians, like SNL alums Jon Lovitz (as the loud and bombastic Radio) and Phil Hartman (who hilariously impersonates both Jack Nicholson and Peter Lorre in great cameos), Disney\/Tony the Tiger voice actor Thurl Ravenscroft as the rumbling vacuum Kirby, Groundlings Deanna Oliver and Tim Stack as Toaster and Lampy, respectively, and Timothy E.

There are plenty to go around in this movie, which some have seen as totally unnecessary and cruel. However, they're no scarier than the original Disney features, which themselves dabbled in darker images to offset the whimsy and sweetness. These scenes also add to the emotions of the journey that anything may face. I must say the darkest, but also the best, has to be the Junkyard sequence which is accompanied by the Van Dyke PArks song Worthless, which evokes more emotion in five minutes than many features can't achieve in two hours. This movie has all the right elements that work to a very good degree. David Newman and Van Dyke Parks' score and songs are pretty impressive, and dare I say brilliant.

Unfortunately, Disney's films were in the malaise era, therefore it's penny-pinching management pulled the plug on the project and fired Lasseter from his job. The project was then taken to independent studio Hyperion, where it ended up in the hands of Lasseter's good friends, animators Jerry Rees (Tron) and Joe Ranft (later Pixar writer) who transformed the novella into a smart screenplay that, unlike Disney, wasn't afraid to take risks with its imagery or ideas.

It's not abysmal, but it strikes me as akin to the filmic equivalent of a garbage pizza. Lots of good ingredients thrown together pell-mell to produce something rather unappetizing.The idea for a good film--or five--is here somewhere, but it's so tangled up with so many other ideas none of which is ever resolved in any satisfactory way, that it's hard to see what exactly the take-away was supposed to be. Monica loves David because David loves Monica but not enough to persuade her husband to keep him around. From there everything devolves into a please every crowd member with something or other adventure action-flick. The film starts down one path for a while, but when it becomes clear that there isn't enough interesting material there, then it lurches in another direction before abandoning that path as well. Maybe this is a case of production fund surfeit? Not sure.I had no idea what this film was going to be about. I am not sure what I was doing in 2001, but I never read or heard anything about Artificial Intelligence. I picked up the DVD at the library under the assumption that it would offer some sort of eye-opening perspective on technology. It tries to, but falls flat because of the incoherent schmaltziness. It just doesn't work. It seemed initially that this was going to be a deep philosophical reflection on love and perhaps even a critique of selfishness and possessiveness. The idea of wanting a robot to love one's self unconditionally and unilaterally--is that really so different from getting a dog? I have to wonder. It's not really like Pascal's Wager, which exhorts would-be believers to go through the motions of religious faith, and one day they will find that they truly believe. That probably works because on some subconscious level the mind recognizes that if the person is doing all of this stuff for God, then if God doesn't exist, that can only mean that the person is flaming mad, complete with visions, voices and ubiquitous spies. But that's another story.The combination of Color Purple-style emotional string pulling and A Clockwork Orange's brazen amoralism doesn't work in this production. It's like oil and water. The movie is also too long, and the utterly gratuitous Jude Law character, to be perfectly frank, just seems like an effort to compensate for some of the vacuity of the main storyline.

Rowling, Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone begins the journey of The Boy Who Lived and covers his adventures during his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. Completely oblivious to the world of magic as well as his famed celebrity status, the young Potter learns to adjust well at his new home & begins to prove his worth but soon realises that this magical world is far more dangerous for him than he imagined.Directed by Chris Columbus, the film is a wonderful treat for kids & families plus as far as the screenplay goes, it remains pretty faithful to its source material. Cinematography beautifully captures the ambiance of Hogwarts, music by John Williams provides a magical feeling of its own & the visual effects clearly doesn't seem to have aged well over the years. Looking back, there are few moments which today seem pretty silly or stupid & unfortunately with every passing year, it's only going to get worse.Coming to the acting department, there are performances ranging from pretty impressive to childish & annoying but I still have nothing to complain about the casting choices made here as not a single actor feels like a miscast in the story. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint & Emma Watson do their part fine but it's Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane & Richard Harris who impress most in their respective roles of Severus Snape, Rubeus Hagrid & Albus Dumbledore.On an overall scale, Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone may not look as magical today as it was during its time of release but it's still a wonderful adaptation of J.K. Rowling's spellbinding world on the silver screen, which would later go on to become a cultural phenomenon of our time.

Most would probably say that his earliest productions were the most original and fun. The best example being Ghost Busters (1984). But as time went on, Reitman started making some oddballs like Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990) and Junior (1994). Then he started reverting back to more realistic normal comedies. This particular film is in this group and has things going for it. The problem is that it gets too bogged down with other details that it forgets what its main purpose was in the first place. The plot focuses on a couple that heads out on vacation when one of them is called back. While returning the partner is stranded on an island with the pilot and must learn to survive together. The plot isn't all that special but the way it's executed is. Anne Heche and David Schwimmer play the couple on vacation as Robin and Frank. There they meet their pilots Quinn (Harrison Ford) and Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors). The two that become stranded on a remote island is Robin and Quinn. There they learn how to survive on their own. Yet, the casting of Schwimmer and Obradors wasn't necessary. It could've just been Robin going on vacation and being stranded with Quinn. It's not that Schwimmer or Obradors aren't funny or can't act, but their character arcs are predictable from the start and it doesn't end clearly either. If a couple is heading to vacation and the first thing your boyfriend does is stare at curvaceous women, I think viewers will have a clear idea where he's headed. It's not new material.First time writer Michael Browning did an OK job defining each character, but they are either clichéd or oddly paired. The other strange casting decision belongs to having Anne Hiche and Harrison Ford being together. Over time after learning how to get along, Robin and Quinn form a relationship. During this time, Ford wasn't the strapping youth he once was. Of course some people still find him attractive but most people's viewpoints would be that Ford is too old to be having any kind of a relationship with what looks to be a late 20s \/ early 30s woman. It's not uncommon (in real life), but for the movie's sake since age isn't the focus, it feels a bit weird. Also cast in the film is Temuera Morrison (known for Jango Fett), Cliff Curtis and Danny Trejo. They are hard to spot at times, but if you see them it's cool to see.The comedy also helps relieve audiences of the either familiar story line or characters. Either when it comes to Frank being goofy or Quinn reacting to Robin's actions, it is genuinely funny. Ford has the best quips. Some of it even reminisces to that of something Indiana Jones would say. Besides it's not all fun and games, Quinn and Robin even run into some modern day pirates. Yikes. The cinematography by Michael Chapman looks great. The view of the islands out to sea looks mesmerizing. Even Randy Edelman's score is nice. It has a theme to represent Quinn and Robin and it sounds memorable. The tune involves piano keys, which isn't the most frequent of an instrument included in a score. It works as a comedy but isn't anything new. The elements of comedy are funny and will have people laughing thanks to its cast. Yet, the casting on a direct basis is questionable and the writing is a bit formulaic.

The other strange casting decision belongs to having Anne Hiche and Harrison Ford being together. Over time after learning how to get along, Robin and Quinn form a relationship. During this time, Ford wasn't the strapping youth he once was. Of course some people still find him attractive but most people's viewpoints would be that Ford is too old to be having any kind of a relationship with what looks to be a late 20s \/ early 30s woman. It's not uncommon (in real life), but for the movie's sake since age isn't the focus, it feels a bit weird. Also cast in the film is Temuera Morrison (known for Jango Fett), Cliff Curtis and Danny Trejo. They are hard to spot at times, but if you see them it's cool to see.The comedy also helps relieve audiences of the either familiar story line or characters. Either when it comes to Frank being goofy or Quinn reacting to Robin's actions, it is genuinely funny. Ford has the best quips. Some of it even reminisces to that of something Indiana Jones would say. Besides it's not all fun and games, Quinn and Robin even run into some modern day pirates. Yikes. The cinematography by Michael Chapman looks great. The view of the islands out to sea looks mesmerizing. Even Randy Edelman's score is nice. It has a theme to represent Quinn and Robin and it sounds memorable. The tune involves piano keys, which isn't the most frequent of an instrument included in a score. It works as a comedy but isn't anything new. The elements of comedy are funny and will have people laughing thanks to its cast.

Most would probably say that his earliest productions were the most original and fun. The best example being Ghost Busters (1984). But as time went on, Reitman started making some oddballs like Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990) and Junior (1994). Then he started reverting back to more realistic normal comedies. This particular film is in this group and has things going for it. The problem is that it gets too bogged down with other details that it forgets what its main purpose was in the first place. The plot focuses on a couple that heads out on vacation when one of them is called back. While returning the partner is stranded on an island with the pilot and must learn to survive together. The plot isn't all that special but the way it's executed is. Anne Heche and David Schwimmer play the couple on vacation as Robin and Frank. There they meet their pilots Quinn (Harrison Ford) and Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors). The two that become stranded on a remote island is Robin and Quinn. There they learn how to survive on their own. Yet, the casting of Schwimmer and Obradors wasn't necessary. It could've just been Robin going on vacation and being stranded with Quinn. It's not that Schwimmer or Obradors aren't funny or can't act, but their character arcs are predictable from the start and it doesn't end clearly either.

It spawned an endless series of films in which young, nubile teenagers are placed in isolated settings, often engaging one another in illicit sexual situations, only to be hacked up in endlessly graphic and gory ways by a madman. Granted, we had those in some form or another well before HALLOWEEN, and indeed, one could say this began with Hitchcock's PSYCHO in 1960, going through to the 1971 Mario Bava film TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE (probably this film's true progenitor) and culminating in the ultra-controversial 1974 opus THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE. But those films had a great deal of energy behind them, and a lot of thought; and even in a film like CHAINSAW, less blood was actually spilled than what everyone said. After HALLOWEEN, most films of this time were concerned with dismemberment, stalking, slashing, axing, and the like, all with both eyes on the mighty box office dollar.Into this breach stepped director Sean S. Cunningham (who helped produce Wes Craven's 1972 cult film THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT) with the original Friday THE 13TH, released in 1980.The basic plot point is that Camp Crystal Lake in New Jersey has been re-opened after two decades, where a boy named Jason Voorhees drowned in the lake as a result of negligence by the camp counselors. A new set of teens have arrived to revive a traditional summer ritual there, which inevitably involves a lot of sexual fooling around. Over the ensuing fifty to sixty minutes following this set-up, those same kids get chopped up, eviscerated, and dismembered in dozens of admittedly inventive, but invariably gory and violent ways&#x97;ways that would be repeated in the dozen or so films in the series that followed, and the dozens upon dozens of other films (A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET; SCREAM; SAW; HOSTEL) that have come since this film came out. In the end, there is only one of them still alive, played by Adrienne King, the only one of the teens not to engage in the kind of sexual activity that led to her friends' untimely demises. But when she meets up with a seemingly kindly woman (Betsy Palmer), she actually meets up with the real killer, since Palmer is the vengeance-seeking mother of the kid that drowned there.This last part is perhaps the most inventive of the film, since, unlike the subsequent sequels that involve Jason and his hockey-mask disguise, it his deranged mother (a la Mrs. Bates in PSYCHO) that does the killing, though, wisely, Palmer doesn't show her stark-raving-bonkers side until it's absolutely necessary. And some of the daytime scenes of Crystal Lake have the feel of the 1972 John Boorman classic DELIVERANCE, itself something of a horror film. But the basic point of Friday THE 13TH's existence is the extremely graphic violence that ensues; and whatever atmosphere and suspense the film otherwise has is abandoned a little more than halfway through for the blood and gore and guts.Friday THE 13TH does boast an early appearance by Kevin Bacon as one of the teens involved; indeed, he was the only one of them who went on to bigger and much better things. And no review of this film would be complete without mentioning the graphic make-up effects of Tom Savini, who worked on DAWN OF THE DEAD in 1978. But in the end, all of this does not, to my mind, make Friday THE 13TH a classic of the horror genre in the manner of PSYCHO, or HALLOWEEN. It is good enough for a rating of six out of ten, but I have to say that's as far as I'm willing to go.

It's difficult, near impossible to consider reviewing it without being at least slightly affected by the wider effect its had. It revitalised the Sci-Fi genre, created the first truly great Space Opera and solidified the summer blockbuster as the movie event. But one must depart from its cultural status to evaluate a defining movie.I mentioned above that Star Wars revitalised the Sci-Fi genre. While true, it did this rather coyly. Star Wars is successful because it doesn't jump knee-deep into Sci-Fi. At its heart, Star Wars is a Western in Space, with classical character tropes dating back to Fantasy of the middle ages (farm boy, princess, etc). It's also an homage to Akira Kurosawa's Samurai western The Hidden Fortress down to the heavy use of the 'wipe' screen transition and the 'sidekick' characters.Regardless, A New Hope succeeds both in spite of and because of its derivative core. It blasts past that with a successful mix of great characters and impressive world building. The Force is ambiguous between being science and magic (though Phantom Menace arguably retcons this, regrettably), and it is really the glue of the various quirks that make Star Wars so memorable; the Empire, the Jedi order, the futuristic Samurai Sword that is the light-sabre.The characters may be clichés, but full enough of life to excel. The main trio are all solid (Hamill being the weakest, but mainly for being stuck with the weakest writing), but the supporting characters make the film. Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan exudes the wisdom of age and the droids bring levity without undermining the film's tone (certain 'modern' films should take note!) Of course James Earl Jones as the voice of Vader steals the show, with a never-beaten level of blockbuster menace.Indeed, the common theme of Star Wars' success is its excellent use of familiarity. The beats are familiar, but are executed excellently. This is helped by ahead-of-their-time effects, combined with John Williams' greatest score. Without a doubt, the resounding score keeps the audience with the highs and lows throughout, and the fact that it gets better with episode V is all the more impressive.That Star Wars succeeds is not in doubt. Where does it fall down? Certainly, one doesn't get points for being as derivative as Star Wars unashamedly is. But George Lucas makes it his own. Providing his talents creating wonderful characters for a wonderful setting. But it also provides his weakness his writing, specifically the dialogue. It's hit and miss- may the force be with you works, but other bits fall flat, and can become cringe-worthy. And it treads on the wrong side of the line of exposition a few too many times. For a film with such impressive practical effects, it's a shame that the 'show, don't tell' maxim is not utilised more.Star Wars flits between predictability and innovation, and for the most part it keeps its balance, and as a result it has created a mega-blockbuster franchise and a generation of fans and filmmakers.

But one must depart from its cultural status to evaluate a defining movie.I mentioned above that Star Wars revitalised the Sci-Fi genre. While true, it did this rather coyly. Star Wars is successful because it doesn't jump knee-deep into Sci-Fi. At its heart, Star Wars is a Western in Space, with classical character tropes dating back to Fantasy of the middle ages (farm boy, princess, etc). It's also an homage to Akira Kurosawa's Samurai western The Hidden Fortress down to the heavy use of the 'wipe' screen transition and the 'sidekick' characters.Regardless, A New Hope succeeds both in spite of and because of its derivative core. It blasts past that with a successful mix of great characters and impressive world building. The Force is ambiguous between being science and magic (though Phantom Menace arguably retcons this, regrettably), and it is really the glue of the various quirks that make Star Wars so memorable; the Empire, the Jedi order, the futuristic Samurai Sword that is the light-sabre.The characters may be clichés, but full enough of life to excel.

Not only it is one of the best films that I have seen based on plays, but it is also one of the absolute best directorial debuts I have seen. Nichols has redefined dramatic acting with this landmark of a film that deserved all of the academy awards it won and even more awards including best actor for Richard Burton's wonderful work, as well as giving the best performance throughout the entire movie. This is a very good movie but some people will disagree with me as to thinking it is great but not for me. Think about it a drunken middle aged married couple trying so hard to embarrass their younger guests, yea not an ingredient for a great film.
