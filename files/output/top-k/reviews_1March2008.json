Basically ageing, pot smoking college Professor Grady Tripp (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Michael Douglas) is having to deal with his third wife leaving him, having an affair with married Dean Sara Gaskell (Fargo's Frances McDormand), and she is pregnant, oh, and he's got writer's block with an improvised novel. He also has to deal with odd, but potentially talented student writer James Leer (Tobey Maguire) who he knows pretty much nothing about. Grady and James are put together when at a party a dog belonging to Sara's husband, the college chancellor is shot by James, oh, and he also takes valuable memorabilia, Marilyn Monroe's (wedding) coat. Grady wants to deal with this in his own way, and thinks it best if James goes home, but with his homo-erotic urges taking over James won't tell much truth about his personal life.

The performances are all good, the direction is good too, I don't know if I can agree with the critics giving it four stars, but it is certainly worth seeing.

But things get complicated as a sneezing lottery agent comes to investigate the claim.This 'grey comedy' has an expansive humor and a great big heart despite its apparently morbid themes. And writer director Kirk Jones does a very nice job of creating real and believable characters despite the often preposterous turns of events. There is also a touch of romance, heart-felt friendship and a great deal of goodness examined in this odd little tale. The eulogy scene near the end is the film's climax, and it is as touching as it is perfectly written. Bannen, who delivered the lines that made this scene himself passed on a year after this film was released. R.I.P, Mr. Bannen, and thanks for what you gave us in this film.The acting is excellent all around. Bannen, Kelly, James Nesbitt and Susan Lynch were all stand-outs for me, but the entire cast should be equally commended. The cinematography is fairly standard but doesn't shy away from contributing some magic to this almost magical story. And the landscape in which the film was made is gorgeous and as believable as it gets.Highly recommended for fans of truly independent cinema.

Ralph Macchio plays Danny Larusso, who moves from New Jersey to California when his mother gets a job transfer. He tries to make friends, but can't seem to fit in with the new community. He has eyes for a girlfriend who recently broke up with Johnny, the main bully character in the film. A jealous Johnny and his friends are also top Karate students at a local gym, run by a sadistic instructor who encourages his students to fight dirty, never back down, as well as to inflict punishment and pain.Daniel took Karate in New Jersey at the local YMCA. But Johnny and his motorcycle friends are tormenting him at every opportunity. A few black eyes and kicks to the body later, Daniel seeks help from their apartment maintenance man, Mr. Miyagi, a wise Karate mentor, who learned from his father that fighting should always be a last resort. He shows Daniel how Karate can be used as an art form, to instill discipline in a positive way. Mr. Miyagi says that Karate should come from the heart, not the fist. He instills gradual self confidence in Daniel by teaching him poise, balance, and coordination exercises through discipline, timing and perseverance. (i.e  Show me, Wax On Wax Off Washing a car, Show me Paint a Fence, Show me, Sand A Floor.) At first, Daniel fails to see how these exercises relate to Karate and while initially resenting them, he begins to form a very touching, emotional bond with Miyagi, who enters Daniel in the big Karate tournament, where the final match is against his nemesis Johnny. The ending is predictable, but worth waiting for, created by the same director who did Rocky and Lean on Me, John Avildsen, you know the formula works....well almost.Bill Conti's music is great and sunny scenic California never looked better. Daniel's mother Lucille also provides strong support, and Pat Morita's Miyagi is deserving of an Oscar. The problem is with lead character, Ralph Macchio.For some reason, listening to his voice and looking at him reminds me of scraping fingernails on a blackboard. It's understandable for him to take on a wuss persona early on in the film. But the problem is, the character inside of him doesn't change where you WANT to root for him. Ralph's enthusiasm from within just isn't there. The birthday party scene is supposed to be one of the film's highlights. But Ralph's lines seem forced, Oh gee, this is great. You did so much already. In the big tournament, when Daniel gets his big win, you don't get the type of emotional high that this movie wants you to have. The reason is because Macchio's persona is somehow more naturally annoying that inspiring.This movie miscast Ralph Macchio as the main character. It needed someone you could really cheer for and care about such as Sean Astin in Rudy, (who would have been great in this role.) a Morgan Freeman in Lean on Me, Edward James Olmos from Stand and Deliver, Sean Penn in Bad Boys, Tim Robbins in The Shawshank Redemption or Sylvester Stallone from Rocky. Ralph Macchio just lacks that type of charisma that is needed that would have made this movie a classic. instead of very good. Survivor's The Moment of Truth as the credits roll, (shamefully not in some TV prints due to copyright issues) is one of the great inspirational songs of any movie. However, Ralph Macchio takes what could have been an awe inspiring powerful knockout film and brings it down to the level of asking, If only it wasn't him, imagine what could have been.

I have my doubts that the majority of cinema-goers will have seen Marion Cotillard in La Vie En Rose but then again, not many people had seen Halle Berry in Monster's Ball before she blubbed her way into the history books. Compared to Renee Zellweger in Bridget Jones' Diary who was also up for Best Actress that year (though Lord alone knows how), Berry was a shoe-in for the award in a movie that not only showcases her talents but provides a powerful lesson in the art of acting from everyone else on screen.Billy Bob Thorton plays Hank, a hate-fuelled and deeply prejudiced Corrections Officers in America's Deep South working alongside his son Sonny (the late Heath Ledger) and living with his racist elderly father Buck (Peter Boyle). After the execution of inmate Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs, otherwise known as P Diddy), Hank's world begins to fall apart - a tragic parallel with that of Lawrence's widow Leticia (Berry) who struggles to pay the rent working as a waitress in Hank's favourite café. Unwittingly, the pair of them start a torrid affair, each of them unaware of the roles and impact they have already have in the other's life so far.Like the similarly-praised Training Day, this is one film that provides the viewer with an dazzling display of powerhouse acting. Berry is faultless, lurching from grieving mother to a strong survivor in a heartbeat and holds your attention in a vice-like grip. But Thorton and Boyle hold their own brilliantly - Boyle's previous comic persona in Everybody Loves Raymond is shattered here and Thorton brings his trade-mark world weariness into a role he was born to play. The supporting cast, led by Ledger and Coronji Calhoun as Berry's obese son Tyrell, also supply powerful and evocative performances and there is nobody on the cast you could criticise. However, the story takes a while to get going and is plausible, to a point. Personally, I thought the scene that defied logic the most was the one everybody talks about and for what this film will probably be remembered for the explicit and brutal love scene. It's a real shame that the collection of outstanding performances in this film will be forgotten in the minds of most (male) viewers and replaced with something crude and unnecessarily graphic.But overlooking the hype and cutting through the crap, Monster's Ball is an exceptional film and one that no serious film fan should miss. The pop-corn munchers and blockbuster junkies won't take too kindly to its slow pace and lack of explosions but you don't need that to make a film of real quality. Berry shows us that for once, she is a legitimate actress and not just eye-candy - perhaps Gothika was a one-off after all! But this is a classic Southern romantic drama, filled with all the heat and passion of the Deep South alongside the dark racial undertones that flow through society. It's engaging and provocative all the way to the final reel, if a little ponderous for my tastes.

Not only is Nicholson as Dupea at his personal best ever, his performance in this film is unparalleled in post-modern cinema.We soon learn he works as a manual laborer in a hot, dusty oil field simply because he is so exceptional that he can do anything he wants, he can truly be anyone...except himself. The people with whom he surrounds himself cannot help being who they are, but they do the best they can with what they have. There is a humanity, an honesty in their simple lives that he admires but cannot find in himself. In a way it is honorable that he does not condescend, that with pleasure he dates a gum-smacking waitress from a diner and goes bowling with his pals. But he wants more, because he will never find what he is searching for in them, there is so much more to him than just a rowdy two-timing roughneck. Frustrated, he erupts in fits of torment and rage that obliterate his mask of sanity. He cannot escape the life he left behind.It is his past, his eccentric but gifted family that comes to bear when he returns to his childhood home on a small, eternally foggy island in Puget Sound. We see the real him emerge the tortured musical genius, the sensitive loving son. We are moved, they are moved, but he is not. He will always see himself as a failure, he has lost all he ever wanted, and nothing else matters. His entire life has been one of self-denial, and as a final act of self-condemnation he rejects himself.The closing scene will always be controversial because of its ambiguity. He looks in the mirror and fearing the past, present, and future dives even deeper into a life of anonymity. He has become no one.Watching this masterpiece is witnessing the journey of not just any man but every man, to choose between finding or losing, accepting or rejecting, living or dying. By watching Robert Dupea, we can choose to do what he could not.

Not only is Nicholson as Dupea at his personal best ever, his performance in this film is unparalleled in post-modern cinema.We soon learn he works as a manual laborer in a hot, dusty oil field simply because he is so exceptional that he can do anything he wants, he can truly be anyone...except himself. The people with whom he surrounds himself cannot help being who they are, but they do the best they can with what they have. There is a humanity, an honesty in their simple lives that he admires but cannot find in himself. In a way it is honorable that he does not condescend, that with pleasure he dates a gum-smacking waitress from a diner and goes bowling with his pals. But he wants more, because he will never find what he is searching for in them, there is so much more to him than just a rowdy two-timing roughneck. Frustrated, he erupts in fits of torment and rage that obliterate his mask of sanity. He cannot escape the life he left behind.It is his past, his eccentric but gifted family that comes to bear when he returns to his childhood home on a small, eternally foggy island in Puget Sound. We see the real him emerge the tortured musical genius, the sensitive loving son. We are moved, they are moved, but he is not. He will always see himself as a failure, he has lost all he ever wanted, and nothing else matters. His entire life has been one of self-denial, and as a final act of self-condemnation he rejects himself.The closing scene will always be controversial because of its ambiguity.

While his early films are a tad rough, I've always thought this criticism was entirely undeserved. With films like SUDDENLY, MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and this film, he proved pretty conclusively that in addition to singing, he was a heck of an actor. I wonder if some of the criticism of Sinatra was more a criticism of him as a person. Sure, he was in many ways difficult, but say what you want about this--he still could act.In VON RYAN'S EXPRESS, Frank plays the leader of a huge group of soldiers who escape from an Italian prison camp. The Italian government is in shambles and the soldiers have no desire to press the war, but when an entire camp of Allied soldiers bolts, the Germans come in force to stop them and save face.This is a big scope picture--with exciting prison camp scenes, chases, railroad scenes, etc. While not the best prison film I have seen, it's among the best and apart from a small handful of films (such as THE DIRTY DOZEN and THE GUNS OF NAVARONE), it's one of the best of the genre made in the 1960s.

A man is in a car crash that kills one of the other passengers, he begins a strange sexual affair with his wife, who also survived the accident. Author JG. Ballard, survived WW2, as documented in Stephen Spielberg's Empire Of The Son, an autobiography of the authors youth, but considers this his most personal work; the main character is named Ballard.Ballard then meets up with a man who is obsessed with re-creating celebrity car crashes, and makes up multiple explanations for his actions which all sound vaugely reasonable, but like The Dark Knight's Joker, all of them are flimsy names for what is basically unexplainable chaotic impulse. Whether he is explaining Crashing as a fertilizing rather than a destructive event, mediating the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity that's impossible in any other form., or discussing the time honored back-seat boogie as reshaping of the human body by modern technology, its all just ego making excuses for Id.More sex is had, and Ballard's wife, and several other people come into the general swinging mix of things.The performances are emotionally stale even during sex, eternally alienated, everyone's looking for greater and greater kicks, and the story moves like any porn should with escalating extremities building toward climax, but if there is a climax, and I'm not totally sure there is one, it comes a little too late, and doesn't leave us with enough intellectual or emotional denouement.In the end everyone is as automatic and mechanistic as the cars they operate, and are forced to collide in order to create spontaneous human contact, but we get that within the first 30 minutes, so why the additional hour sex? A beautiful body is it's own reward, sex has become meaningless, who cares why not, are all decent enough answers, so you can pick whichever sounds best to you.That being said Cronenberg is as much a masterful director of the body and the human form, here as he was ever, veering between unease, violence, the grotesque, and the arousing eventually into a wreck, but a flaming wreck of a film, that fails, but does so in manner that can generate arguments and interesting thoughts, not a film for everyone, but for the minority interested in literate cinematic porn, there may be something amongst the debris.

The movie that turned Arnie into an international star and director James Cameron a highly acclaimed director.The story is dark and disturbing.A nuclear holocaust is about to take place and the machines will take over.The only hope for the remaining human resistance against them is the still unborn leader John Connor.His mother Sara doesn't suspect that a machine called Terminator is sent from the future to assassinate her and prevent John's entire existence.To protect Sara the human resistance sends a man named Kyle Reese.But will he succeed against an enemy who seems unstoppable?And so a dangerous game of cat and mouse begins.There is a lot of action,chills but most importantly a great story ,something new and fresh for 1984 when the movie was released.Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn both give amazing performances and the audience feels what they are going through.But the real credit goes to Arnold himself who is absolutely stunning as the mean machine that kills everyone that gets in its way.He gets shot,burned,hit by a truck and blown up but just keeps coming back.A famous scene is when the Terminator goes into the police station after Sara and kills at least 20 cops in the process.One of the greatest things about the movie is the metal endoskeleton of the robot which looks like Death,covered in metal as Cameron describes it.Its totally terrifying and brutal. In conclusion I'll say that this is one of the greatest films of all time in my opinion and a must see whether you like this genre or not.

Death, defeat, the unknown, commitment, danger, the gaping maw of nature's wrath, Cary Elwes and his corporate sponsors...and sure, tornadoes, if you want to be all surface about it. But really, Twister is about fear, and how people choose to deal with it. The uptight girlfriend flees, while the weatherman can't resist his past life as tornado chaser, and lover of the heroine, tornado-obsessed Helen Hunt, who has formed her life around trying to make sure that no other little girls will have to live in fear of their father getting sucked away while he tries to hold the storm cellar door closed.To do this, she forms a motley crew of character actors (Twister does for the motley tech crew what Die Hard did for the action hero) who are as crazy and thrill-obsessed as her, drives away her dirt-smelling Bill Paxton husband and then steals him back from panicky reproductive therapist Jamie Gertz, drives multiple trucks into the heart of a tornado, and relives the formative experience of her life repeatedly in the quest to finally kick nature in the cojones.The scientific accuracy of the tornadoes is completely irrelevant - they aren't real-life tornadoes, they are a symbol for the ultimate threat, the unknowable void. Do tornadoes work just like they do in the movie? I don't know - most of the tornadoes I've seen up close are in my imagination, or as portrayed by someone else's. And that's the point of tornadoes in Twister, or the disaster in any natural disaster movie. These are the ultimate in devastation - the finger of God, as said in the movie - and as such they represent our fear of being at our weakest and most vulnerable state. (Case in point Helen' Hunt's character, young version.) I think this theme is executed fairly well considering that it's in the context of a big-budget effects thriller. Audiences may not be thinking all this stuff over - and certainly the movie doesn't say much if any of this stuff explicitly - but I think they feel it, and that's why people feel drawn to watch this movie repeatedly, despite its essentially basic and predictable nature. Would you dive into the thrashing pit in order to help save others from future devastation? How would it feel to have Mother Nature literally rip your father from your life...and then continue to stalk those you know and love with the same threat? Would you fight back? Would you give your life to fight back? If you did, you'd be well-put to get yourself a classic nutty motley tech crew headed up by Philip Dusty Barnburner Seymour Hoffman. Though he probably fetches a slightly higher wage these days.The movie has imperfections - the movie's own physics seems cheated to the point of distraction a couple times, and there's at least one action from our heroes which seemed reckless toward others (I like to knock before I drive through someone's house.) But Twister manages to create an effectively threatening villain in an ambitious visual rendering of the classic man vs. nature story.

I think the commander was disqualified to send a bunch of mindless soldiers to their deaths. If he wanted to reduce casualties, he could just send planes to bomb the hell out of them.The violence was on par with Saving Private Ryan. However, the cheesy characters couldn't get our sympathizes. Seeing bunch of soldiers getting decapitated, dismembered and incinerated, I laughed out loudly for their idiocies.The plot was mediocre. But what do you expect? Is it always the same thing for those human-vs-aliens movies. Independence Day, Mars Attacks, Stargate, you name it. The acting was cheesy as hell. I hated every single character in this movie except Sergeant Zim, he was kinda a flesh-and-blood sergeant. And Clancy Brown delivered his best performance since the Shawshank Redemption.

As I write this, it has been fifteen years (or close to fifteen years) since the release of this full-length movie featuring the SNL characters, and I have finally seen it. I don't know what I would think of any of the short Coneheads sketches, but there are definitely better movies featuring SNL characters than this one.Beldar and Prymatt are a couple with cone-shaped heads from the planet Remulak who find themselves stranded on Earth. They hope to be rescued and brought back to their planet, but until that happens, they will have to adjust to life on this planet. They begin to live their lives as middle-class humans, which seems to go well for them. They even give birth to a daughter named Connie. However, the government is very suspicious of this family, as they don't believe they are actually human. Nonetheless, the Coneheads live like this for quite a long time, and remain on Earth as Connie grows up. As a teenager, Connie has trouble with her parents, her love life, etc., and if the Coneheads are ever rescued, she might not want to leave Earth. In addition to that, of course, the government is still after these extraterrestrials!Since Coneheads is based on Saturday Night Live sketches, it's obviously supposed to be a comedy, but sadly, it fails in this genre. I certainly can't say I kept a perfectly straight face throughout, but from what I remember (and I should remember well, since I saw it so recently), I didn't laugh at all. In fact, even during certain parts where I was smiling, I sort of wondered if I should have been. I think an example of this is the scene where Beldar uses window cleaning fluid as mouthwash. I really can't think of too many other examples, since most of the gags are so forgettable. In fact, the movie as a whole is rather forgettable. Aside from the humour, there is a bit of excitement at times in the film, but not very much. The plot isn't the greatest one ever written.Like I said, better movies featuring SNL characters have been made. Dan Aykroyd plays Beldar in this one, and the fact that he is in this movie can easily remind one of The Blues Brothers, an earlier and FAR superior movie spawned by SNL which Aykroyd is very well-known for his role in. Several other SNL stars appear at different points in Coneheads, including Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Phil Hartman, Jon Lovitz, and David Spade, but for all of them, this movie was not a very high point in their careers. Much worse comedies have been green-lit, but much better ones have as well, including other sci-fi comedies. For the most part, Coneheads is just boring.

The plot isn't the greatest one ever written.Like I said, better movies featuring SNL characters have been made. Dan Aykroyd plays Beldar in this one, and the fact that he is in this movie can easily remind one of The Blues Brothers, an earlier and FAR superior movie spawned by SNL which Aykroyd is very well-known for his role in. Several other SNL stars appear at different points in Coneheads, including Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Phil Hartman, Jon Lovitz, and David Spade, but for all of them, this movie was not a very high point in their careers. Much worse comedies have been green-lit, but much better ones have as well, including other sci-fi comedies. For the most part, Coneheads is just boring. ","genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"1 March 2008","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I have known about the Coneheads for years now, and may have seen a bit of a Saturday Night Live skit with the characters at some point back when I was a kid. As I write this, it has been fifteen years (or close to fifteen years) since the release of this full-length movie featuring the SNL characters, and I have finally seen it. I don't know what I would think of any of the short Coneheads sketches, but there are definitely better movies featuring SNL characters than this one.Beldar and Prymatt are a couple with cone-shaped heads from the planet Remulak who find themselves stranded on Earth. They hope to be rescued and brought back to their planet, but until that happens, they will have to adjust to life on this planet. They begin to live their lives as middle-class humans, which seems to go well for them. They even give birth to a daughter named Connie. However, the government is very suspicious of this family, as they don't believe they are actually human. Nonetheless, the Coneheads live like this for quite a long time, and remain on Earth as Connie grows up. As a teenager, Connie has trouble with her parents, her love life, etc., and if the Coneheads are ever rescued, she might not want to leave Earth. In addition to that, of course, the government is still after these extraterrestrials!Since Coneheads is based on Saturday Night Live sketches, it's obviously supposed to be a comedy, but sadly, it fails in this genre. I certainly can't say I kept a perfectly straight face throughout, but from what I remember (and I should remember well, since I saw it so recently), I didn't laugh at all. In fact, even during certain parts where I was smiling, I sort of wondered if I should have been. I think an example of this is the scene where Beldar uses window cleaning fluid as mouthwash. I really can't think of too many other examples, since most of the gags are so forgettable. In fact, the movie as a whole is rather forgettable.

What follows will transfix you for over 2 hours, with exemplary support from Anna Lee as nosy Mrs. Bates, Maidie Norman as a concerned housekeeper, Marjorie Bennett as the overbearing mother of a rotund musician, the eclectic Victor Buono. Last, but not least, are two extraordinary roles for the stars, Bette Davis as drunken Jane, grotesquely made-up, domineering, sadistic and hoping for a show business comeback, and equally matched by Joan Crawford as demure Blanche, comparatively well-groomed, restrained, grounded, yet almost behaving like the eye of a hurricane. Direction of Robert Aldrich is masterful, music by Devol compelling, cinematography (especially when branching out to the light in the final beach scene) arresting, dialog is penchant.

One of the many things it's about is the masks we all wear, and how well they protect the secrets that they were designed to hide. It touched me, excited me, made me so restless to explore the concepts within it that I didn't sleep much the night I saw it because my mind was so super-charged with ideas. It forced me to look at myself and everyone around me in a way I had neglected, or shied away from in the past. It gave me a new perspective - made me wonder if those masks we all so carefully-craft to protect us are really that protection, or a prison we can't escape from. It changed me, and that's a priceless gift. I think Alan Ball's screenplay was genius, and Sam Mendes deftly drew something amazing out of the fine actors who populate this film, and then served it up unflinchingly. I am grateful for this movie. It will always be in my top ten. It's why I look at art-read-watch movies-listen to music...because there is always the chance - the perfect hope - that I will feel something like what American Beauty made me feel.

It was a film I grew up with and has always been a film close to my heart. Quadrophenia is the story of Jimmy, a mod who rides fast on his lambretta and lives faster fuelled by drugs, drink and a huge ego. Back in the 1970's Quadrophenia was a mere idea of musical rebellion on vinyl. Later with Franc Roddam (who later directed Auf Wiedersehen, Pet) they brought flesh and blood to a now legendary rock opera to the big screen. With key British talent playing the youth of tomorrow, Quadrophenia the movie was born. No-one at the time knew what cult classic it would become later in life but it has and will forever be. Quadrophenia is a movie where you can relate to the characters and you feel you are right with them through all the loud parties and the runs on the scooters right up to the fights and the arguments. Jimmy is after being the face the leader of the mods and as we journey through this film we can see that his wish may be the nightmare that he doesn't want. Filled with anger and hate, Jimmy's world slowly begins to crumble, he stands to lose everything that he holds dear to his heart. His world of delusions is dragging him kicking and screaming back to the real world. Phil Daniels gives a heartwarming performance as Jimmy that makes you believe exactly what the character is going through and makes you eventually sympathise with Jimmy. Ray Winstone is great and sometimes funny as his mate Kevin who has a new surprise for Jimmy. It's good to see Two of the cream of London Cockney's working together in a film that boasts the old trait of MADE IN Britain. The first time that they worked together was as rivals in the brutally realistic movie SCUM. I'd love to see another movie with these two sparring off against each other. Toyah it's a mystery Wilcox does a star turn in this as the girl who wants to get off with Jimmy, Dave Wingett makes you laugh as Dave, Jimmy's best mate, Phillip Davis provides some laughs as Chalky (check out the scene in the chemist) Leslie Ash does well in the role as Steph, the girl who Jimmy wants, and Sting as the face of the mods who Jimmy tries to outstage in Brighton. Backed by The Who's rocktastic soundtrack, Quadrophenia is a movie about what it's like to think you're somebody when you ain't and then get brought back to reality with a thud. The spectacular ending to this is the cream on top of this cult classic soufflé with the song that perfectly compliments the final scene sung with gusto by Roger Daltrey I'VE HAD ENOUGH which clearly words exactly what is going through Jimmy's mind at that particular point of the film. My advice is see it now if you haven't seen it before someone spoils the ending for you. Can you see the real me.......can ya?.........CAN YA?!!!
