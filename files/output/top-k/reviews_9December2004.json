[{"date":"9 December 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Arlington Road is one of the most darkest and thrilling action movies ever in My opinion! The film stars Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, Hope Davis, Robert Gossett, Mason Gamble, and Spencer Treat Clark! Bridges has one of his best performances and its one of the best I have seen by any actor! Robbins also has a great performance. As I mentioned the film is a very dark film meaning that it is one hundred-ten percent serious and the nature of the film will terrify the viewer. The music by Angelo Badalamenti and tomandandy is very good. The direction by Mark Pellington is excellent! The ending is unbelievable! If you like the cast mentioned and want to see Jeff Bridges in a great performance and want to see a very dark action thriller then I strongly recommend this film, Arlington Road!
