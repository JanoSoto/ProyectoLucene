The final year of that decade, they released this film, Tarzan. This film reminds me of Disney classics of old. It's a fun, entertaining film that is crisply animated and has a good story.Based off the creation of Edgar Burrough Rice, this film is about a kid who was shipwrecked with his family and is orphaned after his parents were killed by Sabor, a vicious leopard. He is taken in by a herd of gorillas if somewhat reluctantly. Years later, another group of humans come into the area and Tarzan meets Jane and that's where he finds out there are more just like him.This film has a good voice cast. There is some good talent here such as Glenn Close, Brian Blessed, Minnie Driver, and even Lance Henricksen.Overall, this is a very entertaining Disney film. Despite the fact that this film is rated G, adults will like this film even more than the younger ones since it has some mature themes. Another plus is this movie has a very powerful soundtrack thanks to the excellent talent of Phil Collins. This is not the best Disney film, but it's still quite magnificent. I rate this film 9\/10.

Opus 118 was initially created to save the famous violin program created and led by Guaspari from the looming government budget cuts but later expanded its vision to serve public school students of low income by engaging them in the field of musical education. As you might guess, despite of or, perhaps, thanks to being based on a true story, the movie is quite inspirational, very stereotypical, and thus predictable &#x96; a gifted, passionate, innovative teacher, struggling in personal life, a wise school principle deciding to give her a chance, skeptical colleagues, difficult at first kids from low-income families, challenges to overcome, and, of course, traditional Hollywood happy end &#x96; this time in the form of a triumphant all-star concert at Carnegie Hall. And yet there is something in Music of the Heart that elevates it from the comfortable, formulaic, cookie-cutter industrial mediocrity to the noble and mysterious realm of art. And moreover, there is also something that transforms a seemingly undistinguished happy ending story from the closing decade of the last century into a bitter tale, quite relevant more than 20 years after it first appeared on big screen.From the art perspective, one cannot help but notice something obvious &#x96; the great Meryl Streep in her nuanced Oscar- nominated performance as Roberta Guaspari. If I were a cinema scholar, I could have covered many pages with a lengthy dissertation on the ultimate professional heights that Meryl Streep so naturally reaches when portraying her characters. But since I am not a scholar, all I could say is this &#x96; you must see this acting magic with your own eyes; very few actors have ever been able to even approach that level of mastery.The distant second but still very important factor that compensates for the deficiencies of the story is the direction of Wes Craven, a classic music lover and a former English professor, who, however, is mostly famous for his influential horror movies (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream). The impressive work on Music of the Heart proved that the directing talent of Wes Craven is far more versatile than the one required from a typical horror movie director. My personal opinion is that Wes Craven continuing to explore movie genres other than horror is something that would benefit both the director and cinema in general. I should also mention the solid supporting performances of Angela Bassett as the school principal Janet Williams, Aidan Quinn as Roberta's classmate and romantic interest Brian Turner, and Cloris Leachman as Roberta's mother Assunta Guaspari. I also cannot but mention the wonderful music component of the movie that includes some great pieces written for violin (e.g. Bach's concerto in D minor for Two Violins), the impressive original music score by Mason Daring with its crown jewel - an Oscar-nominated song Music of the Heart and last, but not least - the famous concert scene at Carnegie Hall with the legendary violinists Mark O'Connor, Issac Stern, and Itzhak Perlman joining the movie crew.Besides the Meryl Streep s staggering performance, solid directing, and great music, there is something else that makes the movie from the late 1990s relevant today. I do not think, however, that it was intentional on the part of the movie creators; it looks more like an unintended consequence of their attempt to add traditional family values to the movie mix.One of these values is commitment &#x96; commitment to spouse, commitment to children, commitment to students, friends, coworkers, and finally &#x96; commitment to your higher calling to help those that need you. Being committed? It is so nineties (if not fifties). Nowadays we are so self-absorbed, so preoccupied with self-fulfillment (quickly morphing into self-indulgence), self-actualization and other self- words, that being committed to something or somebody other than oneself or making sacrifices for somebody else's benefit seems to be quickly becoming a rarity, an exception from the common rule.I do not think that it is important whether the commitment theme in the movie was intentional or not. For me it is enough that it reflects a timeless truth, the truth that appears to have been mostly condemned to oblivion these days, when everything seems to be relative, subjective, and conditional even such naturally unconditional thing as commitment.Moreover, nowadays it looks like it is almost fashionable to be uncommitted to anything &#x96; to explore things, to try things, to selfishly jump from one thing to another, to avoid attachments that slow you down on your chosen path and hurt your self-fulfillment perspectives.Those who fall victim of that trend I could only refer to the famous saying of the French icon Jean Cocteau Art produces ugly things which frequently become more beautiful with time. Fashion, on the other hand, produces beautiful things that always become ugly with time. The power of his saying lies in the fact that it applies to life just as it applies to art taking life lightly and following fashion in its important matters equals flirting with disaster.Perhaps, the main lesson of the movie is that becoming a great musician or a famous music teacher, acquiring major titles or achieving professional goals, in other words - investing exclusively into your precious self is not something that would fill your heart with music, your life with harmony, and your existence with higher purpose.The path to the true music of the heart leads in the opposite direction &#x96; to investing in others, cultivating awareness, empathy and compassion, and being committed, faithful, and unselfish in your relationships, both professional and personal.www.knowyourmovie.com ","genre":null},{"date":"14 July 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Music of the Heart is based on a true story of Roberta Guaspari &#x96; a gifted violin teacher and a passionate founder of Opus 118 Harlem School of Music private non-profit organization.

As a matter of fact the only Kubrick film I've seen is 2001 A Space Odyssey, which I thought was brilliant. I tried to watch A Clockwork Orange, but never managed to finish it. I'm not a huge Kubrick fan but I do need to watch his films. The Shining is one of those movies that I wish I would have seen years ago because it really hasn't aged too well and after seeing so many horror films I've realized how much they took from this film. That is why perhaps I felt the film to be very predictable, but there is no denying that this film influenced the horror genre during the last three decades and continues to do so. The film was adapted from Stephen King's novel, a writer which I'm not a huge fan of either (although I loved Misery). I guess that having watched The Amityville Horror before this, kind of ruined the suspense for me, but there is no denying that Jack Nicholson's performance was magnificent here during his psychotic transformation. That Here's Johnny scene is such a classic and it is proof that Kubrick knows his craft. He is a perfectionist and it comes through in his direction. The problem I had with this film is that the ghost story really didn't work for me and some of the scenes felt really cheesy. The imagery in this film however is technically brilliant and there is no denying why this film has become a classic.Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a failed writer who is trying to find inspiration for his next novel. He is offered a job as the winter caretaker at an isolated hotel in Colorado and he realizes it would be the perfect place for his writing project. He decides to settle in the hotel along with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and his son Danny (Danny Lloyd) who has some sort of a psychic ability known as the shining. Before the employees of the hotel leave for the winter season they warn Jack to stay away from Room 237 where a terrible murder took place several decades ago. The first person to have terrible visions of the place is Danny, but soon the rest of the family realizes that they aren't the only ones in the hotel. The place begins to take its toll on Jack who slowly begins to go through some sort of transformation that puts the life of his wife and child at risk.The Shining sets a perfect background for a horror story and Kubrick takes advantage of the screenplay and gives us some spectacular visuals. The symmetry of the images, the inclusion of the color red in most of the scenes, the impressive and claustrophobic maze and hotel corridors set the tone and mood of the film. My main issue had to do with the ghost story and the entire shining thing with Danny. Narratively speaking the film has many flaws, but technically it is very well crafted. The only performance I enjoyed here was Jack Nicholson's, but the rest of the cast wasn't really up to par with the movie. I do have to admit that the soundtrack was thrilling. If you leave out the entire ghost thing and realize this really has to do with how isolation can often turn into madness you will appreciate Kubrick's work even more. However, as a horror film this really never managed to scare me or make me feel uneasy so it doesn't really succeed in that level.

Recently I've watched it again from beginning to end in HD. Having watched watched pretty much every episode of all the Star Trek TV shows and all of the movies (including the newest Into Darkness), I felt the need to write a new, updated review for my take on this film. For many years, I hated this film as most other Star Trek fans have over the years. There many bad things about this movie. From the storyline to minor things like random changing between the standard TNG uniforms, this movie had a wild things going on. However, with all the shortcomings of this movie, after recently re-watching this film I've had a change of heart about my attitude towards this film.The good sides of this movie STG is still a good, quality Star Trek film. The camera work, set design, costumes, and the works were all done with superb quality. After having watched most of TNG over recently, I've come to appreciate the nice budget this film got. The CGI, for the most part, is great. The shots of the Enterprise D were fantastic and a huge step up from the TV show models, from the flying through space to the destruction of the ship. In HD, this movie really pops for being almost 20 years old already. Although some find Data's behavior over the top in this film, I found it hilarious and if you are truly a TNG fan you will enjoy Brent Spiner's performance. We even get to see Spot, Data's cat again! Lastly, although I'm not a fan of the story, the villain is great and the concept behind the nexus is intriguing. Now for the bad sides of this film the rest of the storyline! Simply put, STG has too much going on at once. They tried to cram too many things into this movie, making it a loyal TNG film while honoring Captain Kirk's history. The main thing that hurts this film and made many fans including myself dislike it, was the death of Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk's character was forced into this film. I found it completely unnecessary to ever make Picard and Kirk ever meet face-to-face in the first place. And the way William Shatner's Captain Kirk was killed off; I have and always will find it insulting and just plain bad for such a legendary TV icon. Although the story was interesting, in the end, TNG could have had a great start on the big screen without the passing of the torch from Kirk to Picard. The way The Undiscovered Country left off was perfect. Kirk has his last voyage in Enterprise and that was it. Instead they forcibly brought him back in this film as an excuse to involve him with TNG's storyline. In conclusion Star Trek Generations is a decent Star Trek film. If you can get past the mixed timelines\/story and enjoy the good sides of this film, it is still an enjoyable movie with some hidden surprises. With that being said, though, this movie at heart is a TNG film. If you're not a TNG fan, you're going to hate this film. I also don't thing this is a good Star Trek film for the general audience. Unless you're a Star Trek fan, you probably won't get this movie. Of the TNG franchise, I still thing the best of the bunch is First Contact.

It is like no other story I have ever seen, the location is creepy as hallway after hallway, stairway after stairway just makes for a very good suspenseful movie. The Castle Freak is truly wonderful in this movie, probably the best actor in it. Great special effects used to create his look. There is some disgusting violent moments if you are grossed out easily, and some serious nakedness, though brief. I like that the Castle Freak is not easily overtaken, he is fast, seemingly intelligent despite his horrible upbringing, and at times he even shows true sadness in his emotions. I actually felt myself feeling sorry for him a few times! The lead actor completely overacts throughout the whole movie, the wife and daughter are better. I do think it is weird how this movie, done in 1995, has the look and feel of a movie done in the late 70's\/early 80's. Not sure if it is the film quality or if they meant it to be this way.

Bud is also following advice from his father to find another girl who can satisfy his desires that he cannot fulfil, while his parents are disappointed and ashamed of his party girl older sister Ginny (Barbara Loden) who is smokes, drinks, due to sexual promiscuity gets pregnant and has an abortion, and has a marriage annulled. Bud is pressured into attending Yale University, and he does find another girl more willing with sexual desires, while following an attempted rape by another boy Deanie is driven to near madness and put in an institution, her parents are forced to selling stocks to pay for this, and just before the Crash of '29 leading to the Great Depression.

It has an awesome 80s feel to it which is one of the best feelings in a movie for me. There are still talks of a sequel to this film which I think would be a mistake. It is not the 80s anymore and that is one of the things that made this great. The new one would feel too modern and would just not have the same effect... just like Star Wars episodes 1-3.The films starred Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah & M. Emmet Walsh. Everyone did a great job. Especially Rutger. He has a real creepy look about him that I feel he brings to most of the roles he has played.I loved the toys that the character Sebastian made. I thought they were a fantastic part of this movie and really helped to make the movie more fun.I did find that the movie was slow in places... there were quite a few scenes where there was a lot of thinking and just looking. And the blues\/jazz soundtrack was not the greatest... but it kind of felt right with the mood of the film.The film was made by Ridley Scott who is a genius with Sci-Fi films as we know seeing Alien and more recently Prometheus. Ridley is a legend and I hope me makes more movies soon. Ridley is also apparently lined up to direct the new Blade Runner film... whether it be a sequel or remake... no-one knows as of yet.I will give this film 7 out of 10... which is really good seeing as before watching it this time, based on the last 2 times of seeing it, I would have given it 2 out of 10.More human than human is our motto.For more reviews, please like my Facebook pagehttps\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews\/456572047728204?ref=hl ","genre":"Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"14 July 2013","score":"","review":" Highly acclaimed as one of the best comedies in Hollywood history, Some Like It Hot has a neat comedic approach that was sure a topic on every gossiper's agenda in the late '50s.

Without it, Peter Jackson simply wouldn't have attempted The Lord Of The Rings trilogy or Robert Rodriguez would have been unable to shoot Sin City in the same way. On the other hand, I think we would have coped OK if Star Wars Episode 2 - Attack Of The Clones had never appeared in cinemas! I feel that some studios and producers look at what they can do in CG and then start planning a movie and this feels like one of those films. The other problem with CG is that it can date very quickly and I can think of few films that utilise so much CG so badly.Michael Jai White plays Black Ops bad-ass Al Simmons who works for shady Government boss Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). When Wynn betrays Simmons on a mission to destroy a biological weapons facility in North Korea, Simmons is offered to chance by the devil to return to Earth as the leader of Hell's army and avenge his murder. But as Spawn, Simmons finds that things have changed. His widow Wanda (Theresa Randle) has moved on and now married Al's former colleague Terry (D.B. Sweeney) while Wynn has his hands on a biological weapon of his own and plans to use it. But can Spawn trust the devil's right-hand man Clown (John Leguizamo) or does he put his faith in the mysterious old man Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson) that seems to follow him about as well?Spawn is undoubtedly a triumph of effects, at least at the time. Spawn himself, with his vast billowing red cloak and glowing green eyes, looks pretty cool while Leguizamo is completely unrecognisable under a tonne of make-up and prosthetics. But its vision of Hell felt not just predictable but also very poor as the countless number of souls ready to wage war on Heaven look little better than computer sprites. And while the film-makers were focusing on flooding the screen with fancy visuals, they forgot to make the film interesting. Leguizamo goes from being creepy to annoying fairly quickly while Sheen plays the baddie as though he's only read the first page of Playing Villains For Dummies handbook. White, meanwhile, never convinces as the man who regrets dealing with the devil (he obviously never read Faust) while the character itself feels flawed - why did his gunshot wounds heal but not his burnt skin, for example? I'm sure the answers lie somewhere in its comic-book origins but in the film, everything seemed to lead to more questions and more special effects.I actually wanted to like Spawn but alas, it has let me down. I simply didn't care about the characters or the story because I couldn't identify with any of it. It's like a music video - full of cool moments and glorious visual prowess but lacking any substance whatsoever. With a more experienced director at the helm than Mark A.Z. Dippé (who's more of a visual effects supervisor anyway), Spawn might have been more than the fire-and-brimstone effects exercise that it actually is. As such, this is yet another wasted opportunity that reminded me of the live-action Guyver Dark Hero movie in that all you're watching is an actor in a silly suit beating up bad guys, probably in ill-lit and rainy back alleys. If you're looking for sub-standard effects propping up a simple action movie then Spawn might do the trick but genuine action fans should look elsewhere. Just because this is different to most other efforts shouldn't be the sole recommendation for a picture and remember, this was released just two years before the ground-breaking effects-based The Matrix. Ponder that as you wonder why Spawn doesn't use his apparently-limitless powers and relies on a couple of machine-guns instead...

Basically beautiful con artist Jean Harrington (Barbara Stanwyck) has found her latest target is naive rich heir to the Pike Ale fortune, Charles Poncefort Pike (Henry Fonda), he is woman-shy, she works alongside her scheming father 'Colonel' Harrington (Charles Coburn) and his partner Gerald (Melville Cooper). Pike has returned from a year-long expedition in the Amazon, he is a snake expert, and though ladies are surrounding him desperate for his attention, but he turns to putty in the hands of Jean, but of course plans go astray as she is slowly falling for him in reality, and is trying to keep him away from her father. Muggsy (William Demarest), Charles's minder\/valet is highly suspicious of the relationship, and he uncovers what she and her father really are, following this Pike ends it between them, and angry at him, having true feelings, she tries to find a way to reenter his life. Jean manages to do so posing as the niece of Sir Alfred McGlennan Keith (Eric Blore), another conman who is fleecing rich people in Connecticut, she becomes posh Lady Eve Sidwich. Jean instead of rekindling their relationship is determined to torment Charles mercilessly, and he meets Eve is of course besotted with her and is willing to do anything to spend time with her, but Muggsy is trying to convince him of her true identity, Pike does not believe she would come back to him without disguise, so sees the resemblance as coincidental. Following brief courting the couple do get married, and on their train journey to a honeymoon she begins to reveal more about herself, dropping past boyfriend and lover names, and he gets fed up and leaves her jumping off the train, so after this the con team tell her she should try and close the deal and get a settlement. Charles's father and lawyers are trying to come a settlement, but Jean doesn't want any money at all, only to know that if Pike wants to end the relationship for good he should tell her in person, he refuses and through his father she finds out he will be going another travel. In the end though she manages to get on this voyage, this time returning to being Jean, no more Lasy Eve business, Charles is overjoyed to see her and they reignite their love for each other, he confesses to already being married, and she replies so am I. Also starring Eugene Palette as Horace Pike, Eric Blore as Sir Alfred McGlennan Keith \/ 'Pearly', Melville Cooper as Gerald, Martha O'Driscoll as Martha, Janet Beecher as Mrs. Pike, Robert Greig as Burrows and Dora Clement as Gertrude.

Very occasionally by accident rather than design he'd play a track I might like such as Dirt by Death In Vegas . One day he played a track by an act I'd vaguely heard of called The Beta Band . I instantly stopped working as a track was played utterly and helplessly hypnotized by the beauty of the song . The song was Dry The Rain and became the soundtrack of what was an up and down job I had but mainly ups and every time I listen to Dry The Rain I'm reminded of very happy memories mainly of Alan's girlfriend Maria who I'd sometimes share a smile with , or a cigarette or if I was really lucky an existentialist conversation on the meaning of lifeThat's the problem adapting a book like Nick Hornby's HIGH FIDELITY . We're asked to empathise not only with a character on screen but also to remember our own life experience . You can read about it on the printed page and picture yourself in the protagonists place and that's the whole point . We are the surrogate protagonist . It's very difficult to do with on screen visual images that are patently not us especially when they look like John Cusack and speak with an American accentHIGH FIDELITY possibly isn't a novel that's unfilmable but having the character of Rob Gordon constantly break down the figurative fourth wall and address the audience is a risky venture . You'll probably quickly come to the conclusion that you'll love this or hate this and I afraid I didn't love this concept at all . Changing the setting from Britain to America doesn't do the story any favours since you're constantly distracted as to how Americans at the turn of the century are aware of obscure bands like Belle and Sebastian or perhaps even The Smiths . Director Stephen Frears is a Brit and it shows a little too much as he's under the impression that American record buyers of 2000 are the Anglophile music lovers of the 1980s which they certainly were not when this film was released or even when the original source novel was written . Ironically the film might have worked better with a director who was younger and American That said it was very nice hearing the criminally underrated The Beta Band get a name check and a snippet of Dry The Rain and if nothing else this makes the film worth watching . Of course even this dubious value is undermined by Rob referring to them as  The bet-ah band  which just goes to show even if an American knows their music they haven't a clue about the English language and one wonders how this atrocity of pronunciation slipped by the British director ?

It's no exaggeration to say I had to sometimes endure ten hours of non stop Radiohead . Very occasionally by accident rather than design he'd play a track I might like such as Dirt by Death In Vegas . One day he played a track by an act I'd vaguely heard of called The Beta Band . I instantly stopped working as a track was played utterly and helplessly hypnotized by the beauty of the song .

To put it simply, this is a glorious film, that utilizes character development, poignancy, deep thought, personal flaws, and love to tell a story that is one for the history books of cinema.The film focuses on forty-two year old, comedy writer Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) who is going out with seventeen year old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway). Tracy views their relationship as a precocious one that is directly built off of love. Isaac views it as a passing diversion that will soon be forgotten by the both of them. Isaac feels as if he is the last thinking man in a world that is made up of a cesspool of idiots and pseudo-intellectual mouthbreathers. He winds up meeting Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton), who rubs him the wrong way at first, but eventually begins to grow on him for her the intelligence she provides and the waves of passion that seemingly flow off her body.Isaac still continues his relationship with Tracy, even though, at this point, why bother? He personally believes it will go nowhere. Tracy clings to hope that it will go somewhere and frets over the idea it won't and, in the end, feels as if she will soon be facing a dark inevitability of life. The only thing seemingly stopping Isaac from going all the way with Mary is that she is currently dating his friend Yale (Michael Murphy) is dating her. But, then again, it doesn't stop him so much to become romantically invested with her, spending all the time in the world and even having sex; so what is exactly stopping him.This is when Manhattan becomes one of the most involved pictures Allen has ever made. Nothing is truly stopping Isaac, but he is paranoid over small details and sees most everything as either trivial (his relationship with Tracy) or effectively makes it achieve a level of intimacy and success that cannot be passed (his relationship with Mary). Isaac wants his relationship with Mary to pass unfathomable heights that may not exist in reality, and his attachment to Tracy is one out of pure convenience. He is in dire need of a wake up call.Not many filmmakers could portray a relationship between a forty-year-old and a teenager to such great power and believability, and with Woody Allen's reputation as of now, one entering this picture blindly could base the premise too much on reality. The fact is he does a brilliant job taking a controversial subject into light. The scene at the diner between Isaac and Tracy, among many other things, is terrific and captivating and accentuates truly what Allen is about in making deeply involved human dramas.Combine the plot and character elements of the film with amazing black and white photography by Gordon Willis and an amazingly elegant score by George Gershwin and you have a picture that delights on every level for your senses. It's extremely rare a film hit many areas of a film on the head with such confidence and style, but Woody Allen's Manhattan does it and does it boldly, making this one of the best romantic films I have yet to see.Starring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Mariel Hemingway, and Michael Murphy.

He winds up meeting Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton), who rubs him the wrong way at first, but eventually begins to grow on him for her the intelligence she provides and the waves of passion that seemingly flow off her body.Isaac still continues his relationship with Tracy, even though, at this point, why bother? He personally believes it will go nowhere. Tracy clings to hope that it will go somewhere and frets over the idea it won't and, in the end, feels as if she will soon be facing a dark inevitability of life. The only thing seemingly stopping Isaac from going all the way with Mary is that she is currently dating his friend Yale (Michael Murphy) is dating her. But, then again, it doesn't stop him so much to become romantically invested with her, spending all the time in the world and even having sex; so what is exactly stopping him.This is when Manhattan becomes one of the most involved pictures Allen has ever made. Nothing is truly stopping Isaac, but he is paranoid over small details and sees most everything as either trivial (his relationship with Tracy) or effectively makes it achieve a level of intimacy and success that cannot be passed (his relationship with Mary). Isaac wants his relationship with Mary to pass unfathomable heights that may not exist in reality, and his attachment to Tracy is one out of pure convenience. He is in dire need of a wake up call.Not many filmmakers could portray a relationship between a forty-year-old and a teenager to such great power and believability, and with Woody Allen's reputation as of now, one entering this picture blindly could base the premise too much on reality. The fact is he does a brilliant job taking a controversial subject into light. The scene at the diner between Isaac and Tracy, among many other things, is terrific and captivating and accentuates truly what Allen is about in making deeply involved human dramas.Combine the plot and character elements of the film with amazing black and white photography by Gordon Willis and an amazingly elegant score by George Gershwin and you have a picture that delights on every level for your senses. It's extremely rare a film hit many areas of a film on the head with such confidence and style, but Woody Allen's Manhattan does it and does it boldly, making this one of the best romantic films I have yet to see.Starring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Mariel Hemingway, and Michael Murphy.
