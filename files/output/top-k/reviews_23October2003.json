[{"date":"23 October 2003","score":"","review":"  Before i write anymore, I must make a confession. I have never seen Child's Play 1 through 3. However, I am well aware of the history of the series, thanks in large part to the British ban of Child's Play 3 as a knee-jerk reaction to the Jamie Bulger killing. I came to Bride of Chucky expecting very little. A friend of mine said i should watch it and lent me the tape, so watch it i did. And i had a derned good time.This film wastes no time in letting you know where its coming from. In the opening shots, we see a police evidence lockup containing Jason's mask (of Friday the 13th fame) and Freddy's finger knives (of Nightmare on Elm Street infamy). From a locker, a cop pulls a bag containing the shredded remains of Chucky, the once goodguy doll who was possessed by the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray. It is obvious that Chucky will be resurrected, as were Jason and Freddy many times (most recently by Bride's director Ronny Yu, in the crossover Freddy vs Jason), and the setting is one of post-modern horror, as was fashionable at the time of the film's release, thanks to Scream and its disciples.The basic plot is this Chucky's former girlfriend, Tiffany, resurrects Chucky via some needlework and voodoo, who then kills her (whilst she is watching Bride of Frankenstein, geddit?) and pours her soul into a female doll of Chucky's stature. Tiffany manages to convince her hunky neighbour - who is running away with the girlfriend whose Chief of Police uncle has banned him from seeing - to transport the two dolls to Hackensack, New Jersey, where the body of Charles Lee Ray is buried. Once there, the two dolls will exhume the body, claim back the voodoo amulet which will allow them to repossess human bodies, kill the two teens and take over their forms. Its pretty weak at best, but lets face it, you're only here for three things - the dolls, some laughs and some grisly murders. And that's what you get. The Tiffany doll is brilliant and Jennifer Tilly - though i did miss her voluptuous form filling the screen - brings her to life wonderfully. Brad Dourif gives Chucky - now horribly disfigured, thanks to Tiffany's stitch-up job - appropriate levels of menace and sick humour. And the deaths are pleasingly grisly and imaginative.What is good about this is that it never really pretends to be anything other than ridiculous. There are constant references to horror movie staples, such as Pinhead etc., and the script consistently pokes fun at the state of affairs. And the whole thing rattles along at a brisk old pace. At just over 80 minutes, there isn't much screentime when some absurd situation or some blood-letting isn't in the works. It just sets up the plot and the set-pieces and gets on with letting them play out much as you would expect.All the people you dont really warm to get offed pretty quickly. Alexis Arquette, doing his best Marilyn Manson is the first to go, and while Chucky certainly puts him through some pain, the deaths get more elaborate as the film progresses. One of the best scenes sees Chucky blow up a cop car after getting stoned in the back of the teens' truck, and the reaction of a stoned spectator teen to Chucky crawling away and giving him the finger is priceless, and for me the biggest laugh of the film. It also has one of the films two impressive explosions, a minor note, but its always nice to see some good pyrotechnics in a b-movie.Some of the structuring is actually quite neat as well, with the two unaware teens gradually suspecting each other of the string of murders that seem to dog their roadtrip. And anytime someone new enters the fray, you can guarantee they'll get theirs. Perhaps the best death is a tie between the 'honeymoon sweets' murder and the resultant Final Destination-style splattering of one of the film's main characters. There's also a suitably perverse sex scene which was crying out to happen, topped off with a nice punchline, which sets up the film's final twist.And what a twist. Hardly unpredictable, but neat none the less, it tops off a sick and entertaining hour and a half effectively enough to warrant a further sequel. A date movie for horror fans, unless your woman is a) scared of murderous dolls, b) far too lofty for this sort of thing, or c)not into a bit of dark silliness. Otherwise, its a good little film, stylish and pacy enough to rise above Direct to Video horror and spineless dirge like I Know What You Did Last Summer. Give it a go - just don't expect The Silence of the Lambs. There's no Oscars here, and all the better for it.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 October 2003","score":"","review":"  Before i write anymore, I must make a confession.

The film had at least several writers and they just didn't come together to create a film that well, came together for lack of a better word. There was no explanation as to why Marty became a hit man or what the main business was behind all these hits. Not only that, but all the hit men were very mild-mannered and clean-cut. They came across like a bunch of church pastors playing a game of paint ball. IMHO it would of been much funnier for them to have been portrayed as the stereo-typical movie hit men such as the Mafia, for example. Also, some of the hits came off as serious instead of the black humor they were supposed to be. With the exception of a few good, funny moments, a lot of the humor in this movie fell flat. The movie did get somewhat better as it progressed-the scenes at the reunion were decent. And the acting was top-notch-no complaints there at all.

As if this film were an attractive production, the scratchy-voiced comedian Bobcat Goldthwait has joined the cast as a bumbling criminal who likes to watch cheery television shows in his little underground gang hangout. Does that sound like something worth paying to see? Me, neither.Police Academy 2 Their First Assignment is -- oh, and this is very original -- about the new cops' first assignment. Zed (Goldthwait) and his gang move into town and terrorize the peaceful little surroundings, and so Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), and Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow) carry out their assignment of ridding their little town of the bad guys once and for all. Meanwhile, Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf) sparks a relationship with a fellow officer of the law that gets a bit out of hand.Police Academy was nothing new -- just another typical retreat of the underdogs formula which has been used up by movie studios one (million) too many times. Yes, Rocky was a great film, and Stripes was funny, and the following films started to become unfunny. Police Academy was one of the many unfunny ones. And, as I stated in my review of the original, I simply cannot fathom why the original spawned six very, very unwanted sequels.I also said that the first Police Academy film was the best of the series in my review yesterday.

I recently rented this film on video to get myself acquainted with it again. Matt Dillon plays a teacher at a Florida prep school where he is wrongly accused of raping two of his students.  The plot in this film isn't that simple.  You won't know what will happen from one scene to the next.  The film has mystery, comedy, and erotic moments.  With so many Hitchcockian twists and turns, Wild Things doesn't disappoint.  The 3-way sex scene with Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, & Denise Richards is the best reason to see this film.  Denise Richards was a virtually unknown actress before this film came out.  She shot to stardom after millions of people around the world saw her go topless and share an erotic lesbian kiss with Neve Campbell. Trust me people, this scene is HOT!!!  But there are two disappointments in this film.  The first disappointment is that Neve Campbell doesn't go topless. I've discovered that Neve Campbell has it written in all her film contracts that she never goes nude.  That's a shame.  The second disappointment in this film is that Kevin Bacon does go nude.  Near the end of this film, we get to see Kevin Bacon's.... BACON.... dangle in a shower scene.  I think this was Kevin Bacon's first frontal nude scene ever.  Women may like this scene.  Men may want to look away.  Throughout the film, we find out that everybody are not as they seem to be as the characters are being betrayed left and right.... and killed off one-by-one.  I thought the cast members did some fine acting.... except for Matt Dillon.  I thought Matt Dillon was stiff and dull in his performance.  I thought Neve Campbell and Denise Richards were beautiful and gave decent performances with what they could with the B-movie dialogue that was written.  Bill Murray gave a very funny comedic performance as Matt Dillon's defense lawyer.  Kevin Bacon, as always, gave the best performance in this movie.  Wild Things isn't the best movie ever made, but the plot twists and the 3-way sex scene makes this film a fun ride to take.  This will forever be a classic!  Great Film Noir!

I recently rented this film on video to get myself acquainted with it again. Matt Dillon plays a teacher at a Florida prep school where he is wrongly accused of raping two of his students.  The plot in this film isn't that simple.  You won't know what will happen from one scene to the next.  The film has mystery, comedy, and erotic moments.  With so many Hitchcockian twists and turns, Wild Things doesn't disappoint.  The 3-way sex scene with Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, & Denise Richards is the best reason to see this film.  Denise Richards was a virtually unknown actress before this film came out.  She shot to stardom after millions of people around the world saw her go topless and share an erotic lesbian kiss with Neve Campbell. Trust me people, this scene is HOT!!!  But there are two disappointments in this film.  The first disappointment is that Neve Campbell doesn't go topless. I've discovered that Neve Campbell has it written in all her film contracts that she never goes nude.  That's a shame.  The second disappointment in this film is that Kevin Bacon does go nude.

I actually, somewhat stupidly, got off the couch and hugged the television set after it was over. Every single thing in this movie feels absolutely right; right from the beginning.

Sometimes, just sometimes, we'd like to break out into song, probably because of an intensely happy moment we just experienced.

Shallow? Please. Look at some of your more romantic mainstream pap, like, um, Runaway Bride, and then compare the two. Sure, it is lightweight, but it's still a little grounded, and it's all really refreshing.Kind of funny that I'd mention Runaway Bride, seeing how miss Julia is in both that and this.

I also didn't want to reprise the bloody horror of our   involvement in the war in Vietnam that I knew Oliver Stone was going to   serve up. And Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic? I just didn't think it would   work.    Well, my preconceptions were wrong.    First of all, for those who think that Tom Cruise is just another   pretty boy (which was basically my opinion), this movie sets that   mistaken notion to rest. He is nothing short of brilliant in a role   that is enormously demanding--physically, mentally, artistically, and   emotionally. I don't see how anybody could play that role and still be   the same person. Someday in his memoirs, Tom Cruise is going to talk   about being Ron Kovic as directed by Oliver Stone.    And second, Stone's treatment of the sex life of Viet Vets in   wheelchairs is absolutely without sentimentality or silver lining.   There are no rose petals and no soft pedaling. There was no Jane Fonda,   as in Coming Home, to play an angel of love. Instead the high school   girl friend understandably went her own way, and love became something   you bought if you could afford it.    And third, Stone's depiction of America--and this movie really is about   America, from the 1950s to the 1970s--from the pseudo-innocence of   childhood war games and 4th of July parades down Main street USA to   having your guts spilled in a foreign land and your brothers-in-arms   being sent home in body bags--was as indelible as black ink on white   parchment. He takes us from proud moms and patriotic homilies to the   shameful neglect in our Veteran's hospitals to the bloody clashes   between anti-war demonstrators and the police outside convention halls   where reveling conventioneers wave flags and mouth phony slogans.    I have seen most of Stone's work and as far as fidelity to authentic   detail and sustained concentration, this is his best. There are a   thousand details that Stone got exactly right, from Dalton Trumbo's   paperback novel of a paraplegic from WW I, Johnny Got His Gun, that sat   on a tray near Kovic's hospital bed, to the black medic telling him   that there was a more important war going on at the same time as the   Vietnam war, namely the civil rights movement, to a mother throwing her   son out of the house when he no longer fulfilled her trophy case vision   of what her son ought to be, to Willem DaFoe's remark about what you   have to do sexually when nothing in the middle moves.    Also striking were some of the scenes. In particular, the confession   scene at the home of the boy Kovic accidentally shot; the Mexican   brothel scene of sex\/love desperation, the drunken scene at the pool   hall bar and the pretty girl's face he touches, and then the drunken,   hate-filled rage against his mother, and of course the savage hospital   scenes--these and some others were deeply moving and likely to haunt me   for many years to come.    Of course, as usual, Oliver Stone's political message weighed heavily   upon his artistic purpose. Straight-laced conservatives will find his   portrait of America one-sided and offensive and something they'd rather   forget. But I imagine that the guys who fought in Vietnam and managed   to get back somehow and see this movie, will find it redemptive.   Certainly to watch Ron Kovic, just an ordinary Joe who believed in his   country and the sentiments of John Wayne movies and comic book heroics,   go from a depressed, enraged, drug-addled waste of a human being to an   enlightened, focused, articulate, and ultimately triumphant spokesman   for the anti-war movement, for veterans, and the disabled was wonderful   to see. As Stone reminds us, Kovic really did become the hero that his   misguided mother dreamed he would be.    No other Vietnam war movie haunts me like this one. There is something   about coming back less than whole that is worse than not coming back at   all that eats away at our consciousness. And yet in the end there is   here displayed the triumph of the human will and a story about how a   man might find redemption in the most deplorable of circumstances.    --Dennis Littrell, author of Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't   Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

A competing academy schemes deviously in childish ways to get Commander Lassard's new cadets to screw up and therefore make Lassard's academy look bad (resulting in the city closing it down) -- and so Carey Mahoney and co. are brought in to restore peace and point out the bad guys for who they are -- typical, immature bad guys in a very, very cliched script!Police Academy 3 is the starting point of a very ill-fated series; a series whose downfall began with the very first (and which should have been last) entry, and is now starting to become something so disgustingly hideous and vile that it makes you want to close your eyes and whine. Okay, I'll admit it, as horrible as the first two were, they were passable in a strange sort of way. (It's amazing, the kind of thing that will entertain you at 330 in the morning.) But Police Academy 3 is just awful -- the type of so-called comedy that isn't as much a comedy as it is a gigantic sore. I watched it on a truly lazy Sunday afternoon -- which may be why, in my original, older IMDb review, I said it was the type of comedy for people too lazy to mow their lawns on Sundays (something I usually do but had put aside on this particular day for...this...)Surprisingly, the film was directed by Jerry Paris, the man who helmed Part II in the neverending series. He is both an accredited actor and director, appearing in The Untouchables (the TV show, that is), The Dick Van Dyke Show, and directing some classic television programs, including The Odd Couple and Happy Days. Guessing from the outcome of the two films, you'd never guess that he has any background whatsoever.Why Warner Bros. thought shoving him towards the general direction of the director's chair was a good idea is beyond me, but the man obviously suffers from a rare disorder among men named Ican'tdirectavitis (a noun meaning incapable of directing even if the fate of mankind depended on it). Jerry Paris obviously favors dumb sight gags over intelligent humor. He would be great for some kind of Three Stooges remake that I hear the Farrelly Brothers are getting into -- but physical comedy also needs timing just as much as humor of the more psychological kind, something the Farrelly Brothers are good at. (Comedic timing is their perfection.)But poor Jerry Paris couldn't always have been that bad, what with all those television shows behind him. He's Vintage Hollywood. Note the Vintage part. The man simply lost his touch in the later years, which is quite evident through this putrid material. Jerry Paris passed away in 1986, the year Police Academy 3 Back in Training was released into theaters nationwide. With all respect to the man, maybe the fact that he was on his deathbed during the filming of the movie had something to do with its amateuristic style and incompetent humor.Steve Guttenberg remains unfunny for reasons I pointed out in my recent review of the original chapter in this neverending saga. The movies themselves remain disgraceful for noted reasons, as well. But Bobcat Goldthwait and David Graf remain the only two capable comedians in this film -- and their talents are wasted. I enjoyed the character of Tackleberry (Graf) in the first and second film, and Zed (Goldthwait) in the second. They saved what little was left of the series. But not here -- even they cannot lift this film from becoming a boggled mess of unfunny sight gags, flatulence gags, sound gags, and more sight gags.There's nothing more shameful than sequels being shipped out one-a-year in an effort to contribute to a pointless, loathed film series -- it's the most evident sign of a cash-in-franchise ever conceived by the scandalous thieves in Tinseltown. Did they expect the remaining small numbers of fans to turn up for...this? Steve Guttenberg, the man with no shame and sense of morality, even turned down the fifth film in this series. The sad thing? Nobody ever said anything about missing him.The tagline for Police Academy 3 Back in Training is Run for Cover! Out of the thousands of films I have seen, this tagline is one of the most fitting of all time.Run for Cover!I couldn't agree more.1\/5 stars.- John Ulmer ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"23 October 2003","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  I watched this movie again last night. I have to say that I think it is still pretty scary even after the umpteenth time. There are scenes in this movie that give me the chills just thinking back to them.

I mean, how many times have we seen LA so this little Texan town was a nice change, especially since I love stories like these set in these typical American midwestern towns. You've seen and heard the story enough but with interesting twists and outcomes. Nothing spectacular but thought provoking enough.I give kudos to Jennifer Aniston who really de-glamed herself for this role. She made a really good effort and it shows and she really deserves all the acclaim she got for this movie. I don't think we can ignore her efforts and how hard she's trying to prove that she is worthy of praise and she is an actress, not just a TV and movie star cum movie star spouse. Brad Pitt should be proud.The wonderful John C. Reilly is no good looker but a bundle of talents. He and JA look really odd together as husband and wife but I guess that's the irony of it. You don't like him and how he treats JA as his wife - you even cheer for her affair with Jake Gyllenhall's character. As the movie goes along, you realise he's no brainer but he's not malicious and really does love his wife. It would be too much to ask to let him play the lead or hero but he will be around for a long time to come.I've been a fan of Jake Gyllenhall since I saw him in 'Moonlight Mile'. His role in this movie is not too much different; that of a tortured sole in need of salvation and found in the arms of a beautiful woman. I really hope he plays a different character next time but maybe this is his forte. Perhaps, due to his excellent acting, I felt like slapping him in the face and telling him to just lighten up and stop being so depressed! He, or rather his character, was really pathetic.
