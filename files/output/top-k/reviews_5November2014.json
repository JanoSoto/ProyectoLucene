This is the 3rd outing of its two leading stars Tom Hanks from Toy Story and Big and Meg Ryan from Anastasia and Kate & Leopold playing the same damsel in distress in every movie she is in,but I do like Meg Ryan since I was a kid so that is why I bought this on DVD as I like Hanks and Ryan. Also they were good in the movie Sleepless In Seattle which I might get on DVD down the line. Anyway back to the film You've Got Mail which is distributed by Warner Bros Pictures in 1998 while they were celebrating 75 years of movie making is a romantic comedy about two business rivals named Joe Fox(Hanks)and Kathleen Kelly(Ryan)who start chatting online together little do they know that they have met in person on several locations. So the two fall in love online little do they know about their bookstores going head to head as he just opened a bookshop across the corner from Kathleen's bookstore which was ran by her mother before she died and since Fox Bookstores is so popular she has to end up closing up her bookstore.But will Kathleen discover that her secret admirer online is in fact Joe and will she be able to have a relationship with him? Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as the chemistry between Meg & Tom was very good and even though its a tad bit predictable you can't help but root for them to get together like in the 1993 film that they both starred in Sleepless in Seattle. Also I love Ryan's haircut in this movie that in the other film that she was in with that awful haircut in Kate & Leopold another romantic comedy that I secretly enjoy watching. Also starring in this movie(You've Got Mail) is Greg Kinnear from The Last Song as Kathleen's stand in love interest and Steve Zahn from Daddy Day Care. Overall I liked You've Got Mail which is almost on for 2 hours with a running time of 115 minutes and if you love a good romantic comedy that doesn't require sex in it then this is for you.

Well, the movie Toy Story answers just that! This movie has me by my heart strings. Growing up when I was a wee lad of small age and stature. I had grown in love with toys. As all small boys I imagined them being alive. So you can assume when I was a child and saw Toy Story for the first time I was off my rocker and was enamored with this glorious depiction of toys being alive. My childish mind had loved the idea of toys being alive and all the way till today. This movie is a part of me and my childhood. I have a whole box of toy story figures to prove it. The film starts in a small boy's room, named Andy. It is a regular day in 1995 I'm assuming. Cardboard boxes are set up to look like an old western town. Woody, a cowboy doll and one of the main characters, voiced by Tom Hanks, is sheriff in the town. Andy is playing with his toys and pretending Hamm, a piggy bank is wreaking havoc upon the town. And Woody is there to stop him. Within the first two minutes of the film, you have tasted the whole buffet of what you're getting yourself into. A story driven adventure with toys. The toys are lively, relatable and moody. The two main characters are complete opposite in all aspects. There's Woody, a sheriff cowboy, aged with years of play and kind of an old outdated toy, complete with a pull string that says There's a snake in my boot. Buzz Lightyear, voiced by Tim Allen, is a space ranger of star command. He is updated with all new bells and whistles complete with a karate chop action, a laser pointer, and he glows in the dark. The antagonist is the next door neighbor kid, Sid. A creatively destructive boy that likes to blow stuff up. When Buzz shows up unannounced, and threatens Woody's spot on the bed Woody is determined to get rid of him. And what ensues is a wonderful plot that is carried on with lively, entertaining characters. Supporting characters are just as special and well thought out. Mr. Potato Head, is based on the actual toy Mr. Potato head. He, of course is mad at the world and generally grumpy, probably due to the fact he gets his face knocked off many times throughout the film. Slinky, is based on the slinky with a twist of being a dog. His character is rustier and offers the maturity compared to the rest. Rex, a toy tyrannosaurus, is silly, clumsy, and the comedy relief. Hamm, a piggy bank, is the witty, one liner, know it all. Bo Peep, a doll shepherd and the love interest in the movie. Although this plays a very small role in the movie. Sarge is a veteran small plastic army man, who leads a small battalion of little green army men. Lastly there is RC, who is a remote controlled toy vehicle. He doesn't say any words in the movie except his revs he does to communicate with the others. The lovable characters, and beautiful voice acting come from a diverse cast of celebrities and voice actors. The movie also pays close attention to detail to everything you expect and more! I've seen this movie over the years, well over 15 or 20 times. Each time I watch, I notice something new. For instance, I noticed some of the adult jokes in the movie earlier I had not gotten. In one of the scenes Mr. Potato Head gets frustrated and removes his mouth and touches his butt with them. As an innocent child I had disregarded this gesture as something else but in retrospect I now know that he was implying the saying kiss my ass which made me laugh out loud the first time I had gotten it. I had been so naive and innocent before. And now watching the movie with my adult glasses I have gotten a whole new look of the movie. Makes me love it even more. When it offers something to the parents as well, you know you're making an excellent movie.My critiques are few and probably nit-picky. This movie is a well- rounded film and I don't have much to complain about. First off, I wish some of the supporting characters had more screen time to flesh out their personalities even more. I loved the interactions they had and I was sad to see there wasn't much of them throughout the film. Owning the Blu-Ray version of the film made me spot some technical animation errors as well. No film is without errors of course but I thought I'd mention them. The toys' feet seem to shake a tad when they walk and they seem to awkwardly float a little above the ground at times. Also the facial animations can get a bit funky and odd at times. I have no idea how difficult it is to make facial expressions animations on computer software, but I'll give them credit where credit is due. They did a fantastic job and I applaud them.I am no expert on films, but I am just an average joe. A joe that knows a good entertaining movie when he sees one. There is probably more errors or more critiques that I haven't mentioned or noticed but to me the film is as good as it needs to be. To be a kid friendly toy adventure. If you're a kid at heart, I'd still recommend this movie to you. Your inner child will thank you. I know I'll be watching this one for many years to come.

It would go the way of a thousand forgettable westerns or bad romantic comedies.There are just too many things wrong with it.For a start, the acting is awful. Everything depends on our believing that Sean Connery has fallen in love with Tippi Hedren, that he is so smitten he is willing to risk his business, his family, everything for her sake. But Connery's portrayal is so cool and distant that we don't believe for an instant that he is in love with her. He looks at her with a certain interest, perhaps assessing her &#x97; no, to be honest he just looks at her &#x97; but he never shows real emotion, the passion, the tenderness, and especially the loss of self that are the real marks of love. And, of course, it follows, fatally for the film, that there is no chemistry between the two main characters. His love for her is, after all, the entire subject of the film.Transitions are terrible. Just to take one example, Connery mentions rather casually that he plans to marry Hedren, with all the excitement of someone announcing a day of shopping. He is, by the way, doing it completely against her will, essentially blackmailing her into it. He springs the idea on her as a surprise, catching the audience off- guard, too. Then suddenly the marriage is over, and we see the two exiting a house as a married couple. No talk with the family, no preparations, no wedding, nothing. A number of incidents are portrayed like that, with a very disrupting suddenness.But oh, the worst is the hokey psychological nonsense that's served up to explain everything. It's completely shallow, simple-minded, and clichéed, on the same level as cocktail party chit-chat. Hitchcock may have been a good director, but he was not much of a thinker. I just watched Psycho a few days ago, and at the end when a psychologist gives a ridiculously long speech explaining Norman, supposedly justifying to the audience all the events we'd seen, it is embarrassingly awful &#x97; pop psychology of the trashiest kind.Hitchcock made some good movies. Praise him for that. He was a great mechanic of suspense. But don't worship him, don't assume that a movie as silly and badly made as Marnie must somehow be praiseworthy, too, simply because it is part of his oeuvre. It's not. It's a terrible piece of work. I would never have stuck it out to the end if I didn't feel an obligation because it was from Hitchcock.

How it escaped even an accidental viewing is, especially considering my thoughts on it in retrospect and my love of war-based cinema, is baffling.What might color the modern viewer who has yet to experience Born, as it did me, was the idea of Tom Cruise portraying a role more down to earth and realistic than we're used to seeing from the actor. Consider also that in 1989 he was just hitting his stride as a cinematic centerpiece along with the blunt force trauma he had to portray as real-life Vietnam veteran Ron Kovac, and the modern viewer is almost assured of having reservations. Watching some of the special features of my copy of the DVD makes me realize that even then, there were reservations about Cruise. At least outside of Oliver Stone and Ron Kovac, who were sold early on.It takes maybe half the film until you start to understand it, but Cruise does sell it, and he sells with more honest integrity than I think he's put into any role in his career. It doesn't surprise me as much considering the room and avenues of expression Oliver Stone has traditionally given to his actors, but it does further cement Cruise as an actor of quality more so than quantity.The film itself, and all of its particulars, offer sharp contrasts, bare humanity and the horrors we're capable of, and the eventual redemption of a man who I do believe, regardless of our own lives, anyone can relate to on some level. It is a story told many times, but this perspective, unique as all perspectives inherently are, is as vital to the entire story of the Vietnam War and ultimately of defining ourselves as any I've ever considered.Whether or not Stone embellishes is not for me to say; I have yet (and I stress 'yet', as I do believe this film will lead me to reading the book Kovac wrote) to explore the particulars. But, in the end, it doesn't matter; the overall message is as clear as can be by the end. This is the story of a young man who believed and who was deceived, only to once again believe. Each step is fittingly littered with personal conflicts and triumphs, intimate encounters with people from various walks of life. It emphasizes the point that our own beliefs, our own deceptions, our own lives are the product of influence. What we perceive from our families, our friends, our media, inevitably colors our choices in life. For Kovac, these choices led to a swirling chaos of negative consequences. These negative consequences ultimately lead to the redeeming aspects of his later life, but the truth is always there, and it's an ugly truth. A haunting truth, brought to life by haunting moments.What keeps me from considering this film as more than very good is an inherent disconnect of generations. While my generation will perhaps look back on our current conflicts in the Middle East the same way the Vietnam generation looks at their own conflicts and struggles, Oliver Stone was and, with Born, is a part of a generation that I am not. His perspective is not hard to relate to, but it is hard to understand.Beyond that, the film has a handful of small issues that feel more like nitpicking but can't be avoided. The cinematography, while advanced for its time, doesn't lend itself as much to intimacy as it does to the swirl of conflict surrounding Kovac and America. The viewer often feels so swept up in the background that it can be difficult to spot and hone in on the essential point of specific scenes. Also, while I applaud Cruise's efforts in his role, he and several other actors are still either miscast or underutilized in my estimation. The storytelling of Oliver Stone, while easy to digest once the film is finished, is choppy and inconsistent, and I felt that certain moments were not given the emphasis they deserved in the overall story of Ron Kovac.Despite the small flaws, I can't imagine nor have I witnessed a better overall portrayal of a war-torn life and the dirt, grime, pain and suffering that must be carried throughout such a life than this film offers. The gritty realism holds up even today, a time where we can often find more harrowing images on our local news than in this film.

On a 5 star scale I would give 6 of the 7 books in the series (all except Goblet) 5 stars. And when it comes to rating this movie, I would it give it a 10 if I were judging it based strictly on how much I enjoyed it. That said, I think on a 10 star scale the most accurate rating for the movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is 8. The movie is reasonably faithful to the book. And some of the decisions about how to transfer the story from book to film worked incredibly well. For example, the opening chapter of the book is a chapter of crucial importance. But this scene could not be allowed to drag on for 15-20 minutes in the film. A balance had to be struck between respecting the importance of this chapter and condensing it for time and space. The film struck this balance masterfully by eliminating Uncle Vernon's day and only showing Harry's arrival scene. Since that day was really more Uncle Vernon's story than Harry's it was able to be cut without doing any damage and what's left focuses on Harry's story as it should. Plus, cinematically, it worked well to have that whole opening scene set at night. This kind of good decision making was present throughout most of the book to movie transition. The only real flaw is that the main version of the film omits the scene where Harry finds Flammel on the back of the chocolate frog card before Hermione goes to retrieve the book. Hermione going to retrieve the book makes far more sense of the scene of Harry finding Flammel on the chocolate frog card before that is included. This is a deleted scene but it should have been in the main movie. Overall the book is reasonable faithful to the book. The casting is bloody brilliant. Robbie Coltraine and Alan Rickman were PERFECT for the roles of Hagrid and Snape. You can almost feel Hagrid's warmth through the screen when you watch this movie. As you expect, Richard Harris was a great Dumbledore, wonderfully capturing the grandfatherly mentor from the books. It's a shame he didn't live long enough to complete the series because he was so awesome in the role. Daniel and Emma do show some noviceness in this movie but their subsequent performances in the later films proved the casting correct. The special effects and visuals were mixed in this film and are by far the weakest in the series. On one hand, the filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing things like Qudditch, the Great Hall, and the Hogwarts Express to life. On the other hand some of the CGI was too cartoonish.

He claims to be an alien, gets locked in mental institute (understandably), and knows all sorts of things he shouldn't know about astrophysics.So is he an alien or isn't he?

By this time, of course, we know damn well what to expect, and the makers of Halloween 4 aren't about to muck with a winning formula. As scripted by Alan B. McElroy and directed by Dwight H. Little, this isn't without its moments (the rooftop chase scene is one that people remember) even if it's not exactly inspired.After the hospital explosion that concluded Halloween II, 10 years go by, and the comatose Michael Myers revives while being transported by ambulance. He learns that he's got a niece, sired by his now apparently deceased sister Laurie Strode. So he heads back to his old stamping ground of Haddonfield for the usual murder and mayhem, all in the name of killing this young relative of his.Fortunately, the movie benefits a lot from the presence of the late Donald Pleasence, who truly was the heart and soul of this franchise for 17 years. Once again he lends tons of gravitas to the proceedings, and we root for him to exorcise this demon from his life. It's also easy enough to root for our young characters; Ellie Cornell as teenager Rachel Carruthers is cute and appealing in a wholesome, non-flashy way, and film-debuting Danielle Harris is adorable as the niece Jamie. This time Michael Myers is played by stuntman George P. Wilbur, who fails to make Myers particularly creepy. (The horrible mask is another debit.) Character actors Beau Starr and Michael Pataki lend solid support, and the delectable Kathleen Kinmont adds a great deal of sex appeal as the self-serving Kelly. There is an extremely memorable supporting character in the form of Carmen Filpi's wandering reverend, Jack Sayer. It's a nice sequence where Loomis meets Sayer and realizes that he's found a kindred spirit.There is some genuine suspense and atmosphere to enjoy here (those opening credits are brilliant), although there's not very much gore. The climactic action is exciting and ridiculous in about equal measure. The ending is very striking and effective. Longtime Carpenter associate Alan Howarth does the music, using the classic themes as well as composing some of his own.Basically, Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers is good of its type, with enough filmmaking competence to counteract the familiar scenario.Seven out of 10.

But saying it's his worst is saying a lot. Insomnia is a brilliant psychological crime thriller that has a lot of the same beats as other police dramas but it definitely has the Nolan flavor along with it. It's about a detective Will Dormer, played by Al Pacino, who is forced to take up a case in Alaska with his partner in order to save his job because of previous mishaps on a case. The case is one of Kay Connel, a fan of Walter Finch's crime novels.As the movie progresses not only does Dormer have trouble sleeping, hence the title, but has to face his inner demons and mistakes he has made that have shaped an inescapable position. Pacino is brilliant in this film and plays well off of Robin Williams, who plays a surprisingly terrifying villain. I think this is another case of the acting in Nolan's films being overlooked. Nolan always creates great material for his actors to work with and puts them in perfect positions, but only one acting academy nomination has ever come from one of his films. I'm not sure Williams or Pacino's performances should have won Oscars but they are definitely under-appreciated.It's hard not to mention Hilary Swank who gives another incredible performance in a movie that she could have easily been overshadowed by two of the all time greats. Insomnia is one of the all time great crime films and I really hope that after Interstellar Nolan moves back into that genre and maybe even brings back Pacino for something. Perhaps something less cerebral than Inception but captures the intensity that Insomnia does, with the incredible characters of The Prestige.

However, the decision to produce these remakes hasn't yielded satisfying results. Peter Stone earned an Oscar nomination in 1974 for his screenplay, which is adapted from John Godey's 1973 novel.

Lt. Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau) of the New York City Transit Police must contend with City Hall, the demands of the hijackers, and the ticking clock in his efforts to save the passengers and bring the hijackers to justice. The initial hijacking plan doesn't seem to make any sense because their options are so limited. At one point Lt. Garber jokingly says They're gonna get away by asking every man, woman and child in New York City to close their eyes and count to a hundred. But there is a clever getaway plan coordinated by Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw), who plays a former mercenary soldier. His team members include two professional criminals and a fired motorman (Martin Balsam) with a grudge.The main strength of the film is the acting.

The initial hijacking plan doesn't seem to make any sense because their options are so limited. At one point Lt. Garber jokingly says They're gonna get away by asking every man, woman and child in New York City to close their eyes and count to a hundred. But there is a clever getaway plan coordinated by Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw), who plays a former mercenary soldier. His team members include two professional criminals and a fired motorman (Martin Balsam) with a grudge.The main strength of the film is the acting. Shaw, Balsam, and Elizondo each get to play to their own specific skill set. Shaw is cool, devious, and calculating. Balsam is a working class, somewhat decent, criminal. On the other side of things, Matthau is at his sardonic best as Garber. Little time is spent on the back story, subplots, or exploration of motives. It's about a subway train, the bad guys, the good guys, hostages, and money. That's it. comparing the original to the 2009 Tony Scott- directed remake, where substantial screen time is devoted to such concerns, the movie falls well short. Do yourself a favor instead of watching the remake, seek out the original. It's an urban thriller with charisma and a vitality all of its own.

The only reason I give the movie 2 stars out of 10 and not a 1 is because of Willem Dafoe's performance. Don't get me wrong it's by no stretch of the imagination a remarkable performance- in fact, it's just this side of a spastic turn by Michael Richards on the SEINFELD show-, but it IS the one and only thing this monstrosity has going for it. I've never been a John Malcovitch fan, either, and this movie is one of the many reasons why he's supposed to be a German director, yet he loses his accent so often that it's all but non-existent- and the constant theatrical turns as a great director are a pain to watch. The notion of a filmmaker using a real, live vampire to star in a vampire film could STILL be a viable premise, but these people blew it- big.

As a kid, I used to watch this movie endlessly and it has been imprinted in my mind. It's crazy because I know this movie is bad with its cheap props, lazy direction, not so good effects, and of course Jon Voight and whatever it is he was doing in this movie, but I still have fun with this movie every time.Good What I will say that is actually genuinely still good for me are the effects and the music. The CG not so much, but the practical animatronics are still solid and the music is effective. Jon Voight's performance while hammy is always entertaining to watch and Frank Welker is the voice of the anaconda and that's really cool.Bad It's a terribly made movie sometimes. The editing is choppy, the props are obviously fake, there's some REALLY obvious technical goofs, and the characters are just fodder.Overall, while it is a bad movie, it is highly enjoyable if you dig on creature features. If you want to have a good time laughing at Jon Voight's facial expressions, then this is your movie.
