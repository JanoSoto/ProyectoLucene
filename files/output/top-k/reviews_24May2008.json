[{"date":"24 May 2008","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Watching Rounders is no big deal.Starring Matt Damon, Edward Norton, and John Malkovich, this savvy but soporific saga about high-stakes poker seethes with classy acting and authentic atmosphere. Sadly, where drama calls on the plot to pay off, Rounders cashes in its chips. Unfortunately, this low-key, pretentious potboiler never turns up the heat or the hustle. Coming from a gifted director like John Dahl, Rounders qualifies as a major bust. Dahl and freshman screenwriters David (the 2004 Walking Tall remake) Levien and Brian (Ocean's Thirteen) Koppelman develop secondary characters and settings with greater vibrancy than either their hero or his predicament. But even the secondary characters suffer. They register with greater screen presence but less screen time. Evidently, Miramax tamper with the film. Characters enter and exit without explanation and the plot comes and goes in fits and starts. Not only does Rounders ante up only intermittent moments of suspense, sex, and romance, the filmmakers also never must enough momentum to keep the story from stalling out when the action should be steaming ahead.Rounders are card sharps. Mike McDermott (Matt Damon of Good Will Hunting) is a street-wise, young stud working his way through law school with gambling addiction. The movie opens with dramatic potential as he loses $30-thousand dollars of his hard-earned savings to a creepy Russian gambler, Teddy KGD (John Malkovich of Of Mice and Men) in a tense poker match. Mike's fellow law student and live-in squeeze Jo (Gretchen Mol of  Girl 6) persuades him to reform. Earning his bucks as a lowly route salesman holds little appeal for Mike. Mike has poker in his blood. Late one evening, when he stops by to visit his law school dean, Professor Abe Petrosvky (Oscar winner Martin Landau of Ed Wood), he catches them playing a friendly game of low-stakes cards. Mike doesn't have time to examine their hands to know what they're holding. Instead, he can read their faces. If you can't spot the sucker in your first half-hour at the table, Mike explains, dazzling Abe and his colleagues with his extraordinary skills, you are the sucker.Mike is a prodigy at poker. Nevertheless, he lets his more legitimate, status-quo ambitions of getting a law degree interfere with his first love&#151;poker. Like life, Rounders concerns choices. The more that Mike thinks about it, the more that he prefers poker. His blond girlfriend Jo struggles to keep him focused on his legal studies, but neither her love nor her sexuality can overwhelm the thrill that Mike derives from gambling. If you look hard enough, Rounders shares some literary similarities with the classic American novel Huckleberry Finn. Like the carefree, irresponsible Huck who runs off to the river, Mike knows that he shouldn't be gambling. Jo imitates the Widow as she struggles futilely to break him of his poker addiction. Rounders takes place in the shady gambling dens of the Big Apple. These hidden lairs lure Mike with the same potency that the river seduced Huck. Unlike Huckleberry Finn, however, Rounder doesn't qualify as a classic.On the other hand, Mike doesn't have the reliable friend that Huck had in runaway slave Jim. Instead, Mike has Les Murphy (Edward Norton of American X at his sleazy best). Aptly nicknamed 'Worm,' Les is just as ill-behaved as the couple of con-artists that hitched a ride with Huck on his raft down the river. Worm gets out of prison no long after Rounders unfolds. Mike and Worm had a scam going a couple of years back when their luck eroded. Worm shut his trap, took the rap, and did the time. Now, Mike feels indebted to his old scummy buddy. Worm has no qualms. He cheats everybody, Mike included, and never blinks. Eventually, Jo moves out when she learns that Mike is bluffing her again.Now, not only does Mike find himself saddled with Worm's staggering $25-thousand dollar debt, but also Worm's unsavory adversaries harass him. Things worsen when Mike finds out that Grama (Michael Rispoli of The Weather Man), a vicious thug who pimps for KGB, has brought up Worm note. Grama threatens to smash Worm's arms and legs if he doesn't fork over the fund in 48 hours. Mike and Worm hit the road in search of suckers. Refusing to let Worm win by cheating, Mike vows to get their bucks solely on the strength of his gambling genius. Things are looking up and Mike is winning hand after hand from a bunch of cops when the incorrigible Worm shows up and spoils everything. The cops catch Worm dealing off the bottom of the deck. Confiscating all their dough, the boys-in-blue beat them black and blue. Rather than face an even worse beating from Grama, Worm leaves Mike in the lurch.Nobody gives a bad performance in Rounders. Matt Damon evokes more sympathy here than he did in Good Will Hunting. Indeed, these two Damon characters share similarities. They both display genius in their calling. Mike either wins or loses by knowing facial tick of his opponents. The filmmakers beef up Mike's charisma by letting him provide narration. Mike's character suffers his biggest drawback from passivity. The writers don't give Mike much spunk. Matt Damon breathes life into a pretty, colorless character. The scenarists stretch credibility when Mike allows Worm to use him. Something is missing. For all the card sense that he possesses, Mike shows little common sense.Good movies require a beginning, middle, and an ending. Rounders bogs down in the middle. The movie starts well but stalls out early. The story digresses and wander off onto lateral concerns. Rounders doesn't end with a bang, but folds without a sight of hope. Ultimately, Rounders lacks both the psychological tension and depth of the 1974 James Caan movie The Gambler about a compulsive gambler in the self-destructive those of a wagering addiction.

The job weighs on him as a lovely widow returns to the grave of her much older husband, turning his world upside down..her otherworldly beauty shakes him out of the daily grind of blasting holes in the skulls of the undead. But, when she becomes a victim of an unfortunate error caused by his hand, our dark hero's life follows a downward spiral.What a film! If the ending doesn't leave you breathless, Anna Falchi as the unattainable muse our hero Francesco Dellamorte(..played dead-pan by the handsome Rupert Everett)covets deeply, with fate always snatching her from his grasp, will. I have to say that Falchi must be considered one of the most beautiful women to ever grace a horror film, in or out of clothes. I would even agree that sex in cemeteries isn't exactly the most erotic choice for a locale, but thanks to the attractive leads, these moments are actually highly charged. Visually, the film, scene to scene, offer one dazzling, brilliantly conceived set piece after another. Such as the ossuary with the walls of skulls, roots & skeletal bones as Dellamorte and Falchi's She kiss while their heads are covered by veils was just stunningly realized. Or, the amazing silhouetted kiss with the massive backdrop of an enlarged moon. The Grim Reaper, as he forms from the burning pages of phone books(..Dellamorte's favorite reading material), warning Dellamorte against taking his job. Dellamorte's shower interrupted by zombie cub scouts, and an enraged male nun(?!), trying to receive help from his assistance Gnaghi(François Hadji-Lazaro, nyah!)whose immersed in his television program. The mayor, always concerned with keeping his role in office, being attacked by his dead daughter's angry severed head when he wouldn't blessing in her marrying Gnaghi! Zombie Claudio exploding from his grave on a motorcycle with mortal girlfriend allowing him to feast from her flesh, furious when Dellamorte wished to put an end to her undead beloved. It seems that the film leaves some cold because of the macabre comedy such as the killing spree that ignites supposedly by Dellamorte on live humans. But, I think, the film, through an enigmatic, existential script, shows the disturbing plight of a man burdened with a career that has denied him of a life that perhaps doesn't(..or never has)exist. A theme that never dies is the denial of love for Dellamorte. He's teased by the idea of love when Falchi returns, in various forms as other characters, but is always left wanting. That ending which leaves the jaw-dropping, what the.. feeling I think is hinted at during Dellamorte's chats with Death. His final moment with the Grim Reaper, as Dellamorte decides to leave the only place he's truly ever called home, has Death asking him, Where are you going if you don't understand the difference between life and me? Ahhh, such food for thought once you add that statement to a visual touch igniting that question, as Dellamorte and Gnaghi pursue what lies at the end of a tunnel. What life has this cemetery man ever known other than the job of sending the dead back where they belong, just yearning to return and ending up back in their graves? Besides the more difficult material presented, zombie fans ought to get fulfilled by plenty of gory attacks such as the use of Dellamorte's pistol as it blasts through heads and the way a spate sticks into the skull. There's a very violent sequence where Dellamorte shoots hospital staff and a nun come to check on an old pal of his, comatose on the verge of death, which might leave a few people disturbed..even though it seems played as tongue-in-cheek. And, even before this a massacre leaving several dead by Dellamorte's hand seemed like a dream, until the police detective came pounding at his door with the news(At time I get ahead of my work). And, a gag the film plays with is the police detective who never suspects Dellamorte despite evidence of possible wrong-doing. There's also some very quotable dialogue, often thought-provoking and interesting. There's laughs aplenty through poor Gnaghi, with his ugly looks and rather untidy manner...he's such a lovable(..and devoted) character, though. Some of the effects are flawed such as the little balls of flame where string can easily be seen, or some zombie heads which get destroyed. I guess this could be a bit heavy-handed and outrageous for some, but I found it Gothic bliss with non-stop visual imagery and an unpredictable nature I loved. It's quite wicked, though, and not for everyone. I think this will be Soavi's considered masterpiece like SUSPIRIA was for his teacher Dario Argento. The snow globe that closes the film adds the perfect touch of mystery that leaves you pondering on what you had just finished watching.

Some of the effects are flawed such as the little balls of flame where string can easily be seen, or some zombie heads which get destroyed. I guess this could be a bit heavy-handed and outrageous for some, but I found it Gothic bliss with non-stop visual imagery and an unpredictable nature I loved. It's quite wicked, though, and not for everyone. I think this will be Soavi's considered masterpiece like SUSPIRIA was for his teacher Dario Argento.

The job weighs on him as a lovely widow returns to the grave of her much older husband, turning his world upside down..her otherworldly beauty shakes him out of the daily grind of blasting holes in the skulls of the undead. But, when she becomes a victim of an unfortunate error caused by his hand, our dark hero's life follows a downward spiral.What a film! If the ending doesn't leave you breathless, Anna Falchi as the unattainable muse our hero Francesco Dellamorte(..played dead-pan by the handsome Rupert Everett)covets deeply, with fate always snatching her from his grasp, will. I have to say that Falchi must be considered one of the most beautiful women to ever grace a horror film, in or out of clothes. I would even agree that sex in cemeteries isn't exactly the most erotic choice for a locale, but thanks to the attractive leads, these moments are actually highly charged. Visually, the film, scene to scene, offer one dazzling, brilliantly conceived set piece after another. Such as the ossuary with the walls of skulls, roots & skeletal bones as Dellamorte and Falchi's She kiss while their heads are covered by veils was just stunningly realized. Or, the amazing silhouetted kiss with the massive backdrop of an enlarged moon. The Grim Reaper, as he forms from the burning pages of phone books(..Dellamorte's favorite reading material), warning Dellamorte against taking his job. Dellamorte's shower interrupted by zombie cub scouts, and an enraged male nun(?!), trying to receive help from his assistance Gnaghi(François Hadji-Lazaro, nyah!)whose immersed in his television program. The mayor, always concerned with keeping his role in office, being attacked by his dead daughter's angry severed head when he wouldn't blessing in her marrying Gnaghi! Zombie Claudio exploding from his grave on a motorcycle with mortal girlfriend allowing him to feast from her flesh, furious when Dellamorte wished to put an end to her undead beloved. It seems that the film leaves some cold because of the macabre comedy such as the killing spree that ignites supposedly by Dellamorte on live humans. But, I think, the film, through an enigmatic, existential script, shows the disturbing plight of a man burdened with a career that has denied him of a life that perhaps doesn't(..or never has)exist. A theme that never dies is the denial of love for Dellamorte. He's teased by the idea of love when Falchi returns, in various forms as other characters, but is always left wanting.

In following the mundane activities of their trip and first night away we learn quite a bit about them. The rhythms of their married life have long since been grooved. Marie's attachment to Jean is apparent, but Jean's feelings for Marie are less well established and this becomes a relevant plot element.On the day after their arrival at the summer home the couple go to the beach. While Marie suns herself, Jean goes for a swim and he does not come back. Marie goes through all of the expected reactions - waiting anxiously, calling the police, witnessing the search, and finally giving up. It is here that we move into the deeper waters of the story, as it were. The expressions on Jean's face just prior to his going on the swim sets the tone of ambiguity as to the cause of his vanishing. Was his disappearance an accident, suicide, or willful?Marie deals with this bewildering situation by entering into a state of denial and this is where Rampling and Ozon boost this movie beyond the ordinary as they subtly trace the gradual chipping away of Marie's illusions. The reaction shots of Marie's seeing an older man swimming in a pool, or receiving a recorded message that a body has been found, are powerful in their understatement. The use of lighting to accentuate Marie's moods is quite effective, like the use of harsh white light when she is in obvious agony.Rampling is at the top of her form and she completely puts to rest any idea that a woman in her 50s cannot be sexy.The subtext of how Marie's friends try to deal with her reactions is engaging, making you wonder about the best way to deal with a friend in a state of denial. You want to be supportive, but also want to encourage them to face what you think are the realities of the situation.Relationships are always more complicated than the participants understand and, as is the case here, a traumatic event can unleash emotions and thoughts previously unexplored.

The premise of a resort where you can kill, steal, fornicate,etc without consequence while playing a role in a make believe world is tempting, to say the least. There are quite a few underlying themes, man vs machine, fidelity, controlling the environment, to name a few. I think that they are all well represented in this film. Its presented in a way that will pull you in and keep you glued to the screen until the end! Are there plot\/techinical problems? Sure, as in any film. There are times a deactivated robot is blinking or breathing, a gun that shoot bullets until the battery dies, etc, you could even challenge the idea that power to the robots could be cut off since they are not plugged into any thing. I recommend you ignore this small issues and enjoy the film on all of its levels.
