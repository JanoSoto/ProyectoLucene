Just think of the scene in which Dersu and the Capitan spy one another through the dense woods, reunited after years, and rush towards one another, shouting each other's names. It was a giddy moment, and tearful.As much as these two very different men bond, they remain different. Though Arseniev is changed dramatically by Dersu's influence (as are his men, to some extent), Dersu remains pretty much the same. He is organic, part of his wild environment, as much as the trees, rivers or animals. His inner thoughts, though partly understood by Arseniev, remain largely a mystery to the sensitive Captain. In some ways, I think the latter likes this better than knowing all about Dersu, as if he ever could.Much has been made of the stunning scenery and Kurosawa's lingering way of filming it, which was so perfect. There were also very intense scenes, in which the two men were pitted against the very active forces of nature, such as a snowstorm and a raging river, not to mention the mysterious and symbolic tiger that stalks them. Add to all that the humor that bubbles up regularly, from both men, usually in surprise at the odd way the other does things, and you have a very dynamic film, despite its apparent tranquility. One of my favorite scenes is the Christmas encampment, in which the men have decorated a tree with various things like tin cans, forks and even chunks of ice. It signifies the turning point, especially for Dersu. At first it is comical, but this is also when he becomes obsessed with the tiger's ghost.I can't imagine anyone finding the pace of this film slow; it is just right. Any faster and we would have The Edge instead (which makes me wonder if some of that was inspired by Dersu Uzala). Not that the latter film was bad--I actually like it quiet a bit--but it is no Dersu Uzala; few films ARE.-SPOILER- I agree with the person who wrote that Dersu's death seems appropriate; for, once his sight was almost gone, how could he live in his natural environment? And he could not handle modern, city life. It was the only way out for him, though quite sad. To me, it symbolized the death of the old hunter-gatherer culture across the world, and the triumph of industrialization. Even Arseniev, despite his respect for Dersu, makes no attempt to change his modern lifestyle to go live in the wild. He is content to be part of the 20th Century.The fact that the two men bond so deeply WITHOUT becoming like one another or trying to imitate each other to any great extent, is what makes this a love story, I think, and a tragic one. They know that they can never live in one another's worlds for long, try as they may.Some have compared Dersu Uzala to Yoda, but I think the old man would laugh at this. Unlike Yoda, he did not seem to see himself as particularly special, which was part of his charm. He reminds me more of Jeremiah Johnson or later, Lt. Dunbar, or better yet, Kicking Bird in Dances with Wolves. He craves simplicity and merely living off the land, not wisdom, nor even enlightenment, as Westerners see it. Perhaps that's because he already has it.

Plus, the Bodega Bay scenario is so beautiful that it brings visual appeal and charm to the film.This movie deals with unusual bird attacks against humankind. It's as if the birds had declared war against us. They develop strange and aggressive behavior. Even the innocent love birds act funny (although they don't actually harm anyone). The attacks start off as minor, but eventually increase with increasing viciousness and violence. Innovative, ground-breaking, unique, surprising, shocking, chaotic and great are some of the words that perfectly describe this motion picture. As far as I know, there's nothing quite like it. Think of The Birds as the Jaws of its day.It kind of makes me wonder if this movie made many people look at birds differently, particularly those who had the chance to watch it in 1963. The birds responsible for the attacks are seagulls, crows and perhaps even ravens, birds known for their bad temper. Gulls are such beautiful, elegant, graceful and noble-looking and confident-looking birds that fly beautifully &#x96; even though their foul temper is another one of their trademarks.There are many memorable scenes. In fact, all of the birds's attacks are memorable scenes. Even the birds's sounds when they make noise, peck and flap their wings are awesome. This film makes a great combination of terror and suspense in an old-fashioned way with its old-fashioned charm. It is also rich in light humor. The cast is clever and quite interesting. Rod Taylor is terrific and great fun as the smug but cool and charming lawyer Mitch Brenner. His chemistry with Melanie Daniels (well portrayed by Tippi Hedren) is perfect in a most unusual and, most of all, hilarious way. I love it how they keep telling lies to each other and the way they are clearly enjoying that, which results in many memorable moments of comedy. Equally hilarious is how two men kept saying that the little Brenner girl's name was either Alice or Lois when her name has nothing to do with those Cathy.Veronica Cartwright's performance as Cathy Brenner is extremely good and her enormous eyes are very expressive. Jessica Tandy is an interesting choice as Lydia Brenner, the overprotective mother of Mitch and Cathy. While her acting is very good, what really rings a bell on me is the fact that she looks almost exactly the same as Tippi Hedren. She looks as if she was a much older version of Tippi Hedren.The Brenners are an unusual family. Mitch is so much older and bigger than Cathy that he looks much more as if he is her father than her brother. Lydia is elderly enough to look like Mitch's mother, but looks much more as if she is Cathy's grandmother than her mother. What a strange family...Suzanne Pleshette is pretty natural as the teacher Annie Hayworth. Plus, she oozed sophistication and grace and had a sexy husky voice. Ethel Griffies is a very interesting choice as Mrs. Bundy, the English ornithologist, who happens to be a very interesting character with nothing more than a minor role in the movie. I don't know the name of the actor who portrayed the character who kept saying that the war of the birds against humans was the Apocalypse, but whoever he was his acting was absolutely impeccable. Even the other adults and children with minor roles are all very well chosen and do quite well in their roles.

But after two missions go wrong, he is forced to go back to his home town, Grosse Pointe using his high school reunion as a cover for an assassination attempt on a Federal Witness. Whilst he is there he explores his old town and has to make conservation with old school friends, but the person he needs to make an amends with is Debi (Minnie Driver), the girl he left on prom night. As he turns to say sorry to his old flame he re-evaluates his life and career but he is followed by a Basque terrorist (Benny Urquidez), two NSA agents (Hank Azaria and K. Todd Freeman) and his old rival Grocer (Dan Aykroyd (his best role outside Ghostbusters)) who wants to form a hit-man union.What makes Grosse Pointe Blanke work is that it has a very well written screenplay and the strong chemistry between the actors. Grosse Pointe Blanke has strong dialogue and character development, with much of the humour relying most on intelligence, observation and character driven. There is also some physical humour involving the over the top action scenes, parodying action films of the action films of the 80s and 90s, like the gun fight in the convenient store. There are funny ideas like Grocer wanting to unionise assassins, a profession which might be hard to get its workers to unite for obvious reasons.There is excellent chemistry between Cusack and Driver. You can really believe that there was a past between them and we see them reignite their relationship. They were natural together. There is also a strong relationship between Cusack and Aykroyd because they were friends who worked together but now rivals.There is a fun concept in the film about a man having to go back, face their past and meet people they possibly never wanted to see again. It something a lot of people would feel. It also sets out to humanise an assassin, showing that they have a past and that do have human emotions. Martin is a more complex character.There is an excellent soundtrack in this film, using the Specials, the Clash and many classic songs of the 80s. Joe Strummer composes the score for a film then you know you are onto a winner.There are some minor logical problems like when after the store was blown up surely the local media might have shown an interest. But it is nothing that could destroy the film.Overall, a fun film for anyone who enjoys action or comedy.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance"},{"date":"21 November 2010","score":"","review":" When I was at College doing my A-Levels some of my friends really loved and raved about but it has taken me a while to funny see and I am pleased with the result of this black action comedy.Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a skilled assassin and can do a variety of missions. But after two missions go wrong, he is forced to go back to his home town, Grosse Pointe using his high school reunion as a cover for an assassination attempt on a Federal Witness. Whilst he is there he explores his old town and has to make conservation with old school friends, but the person he needs to make an amends with is Debi (Minnie Driver), the girl he left on prom night. As he turns to say sorry to his old flame he re-evaluates his life and career but he is followed by a Basque terrorist (Benny Urquidez), two NSA agents (Hank Azaria and K. Todd Freeman) and his old rival Grocer (Dan Aykroyd (his best role outside Ghostbusters)) who wants to form a hit-man union.What makes Grosse Pointe Blanke work is that it has a very well written screenplay and the strong chemistry between the actors. Grosse Pointe Blanke has strong dialogue and character development, with much of the humour relying most on intelligence, observation and character driven. There is also some physical humour involving the over the top action scenes, parodying action films of the action films of the 80s and 90s, like the gun fight in the convenient store. There are funny ideas like Grocer wanting to unionise assassins, a profession which might be hard to get its workers to unite for obvious reasons.There is excellent chemistry between Cusack and Driver. You can really believe that there was a past between them and we see them reignite their relationship. They were natural together. There is also a strong relationship between Cusack and Aykroyd because they were friends who worked together but now rivals.There is a fun concept in the film about a man having to go back, face their past and meet people they possibly never wanted to see again. It something a lot of people would feel. It also sets out to humanise an assassin, showing that they have a past and that do have human emotions. Martin is a more complex character.There is an excellent soundtrack in this film, using the Specials, the Clash and many classic songs of the 80s. Joe Strummer composes the score for a film then you know you are onto a winner.There are some minor logical problems like when after the store was blown up surely the local media might have shown an interest. But it is nothing that could destroy the film.Overall, a fun film for anyone who enjoys action or comedy.

It can be sappy, it can be schmaltzy, it can be awkward, and it can be violent. For the film True Romance, we focus on the violent. The film is only written, not directed by, Quentin Tarantino, and you will not forget it. It is directed by Tony Scott, and props to him for handling a Tarantino script so substantially. True Romance is about Clarence Worley, played by Christian Slater. On a lonely night, Clarence meets Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) and makes love to her that night, only to find out later that she is a call girl. It doesn't matter to Clarence, however, as he eventually goes on to marry Alabama. The films begins as a sappy romance story, but it eventually leads to being a parody of the typical boy meets girl story. The trouble begins when Clarence goes and kills Alabama's former pimp (played by the always incredible Gary Oldman) and steals 500 grand worth of cocaine from him. The two star-crossed lovers find themselves in a mess when they skip town to try to sell the cocaine in Hollywood, all the while being chased by the mobsters who want their stash back. What could have been a silly and over the top disaster of a film, becomes something absolutely awesome.True Romance is simply just fun and intense. The story is absurd and crazy, and it fits with all its hectic dialouge and nutty characters. Everything in this film works. Clarence and Alabama are the only two characters in the film that we begin and end with. The rest of the cast is a makeup of cameos, each serving their own great purpose. Gary Oldman's scene as the pimp Drexl is absolutely incredible, and Oldman proves once again that he is one of the greatest character actors of this age. Dennis Hopper appears for a couple of scenes as Clarence's father, and he masters his scenes with all his subtle excellence. In his final scene he appears with Christopher Walken, and it makes for one of the most intense and riveting scenes of the whole film. It is one that will keep you on the edge of your seat with suspense billowing over you. Other talents like Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, and even Samuel L. Jackson for a very brief scene, give each of their scenes the full appreciation and dedication they deserve.I can't imagine what this film would have been like if it didn't have the kind of talent behind its dialouge like Quentin Tarantino. This kind of darkly comic, visceral, pulpy thriller is just what Tarantino excels at, and he turns a schmaltzy romance into a violent and drugged up thriller, that happens to be driven by a strange and very unconventional romance. Ironically, Tarantino was hardly a recognized name at this point in his career. His only credit at this point was his independent success of Reservoir Dogs (1992), that really wouldn't get the recognition it deserved until the massive success of Pulp Fiction (1994), the year after True Romance. And even though Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are, in my opinion, much better films, True Romance is not a film to be forgotten. It can definitely be considered a hidden gem.True Romance delivers everything you want. It has a great story, snappy and quick witted dialouge, a great cast of characters, and some of the most wicked and bloodiest fight scenes you'll see, especially in films with the word romance in them. The title of the film is extremely fitting, because this film no doubt displays the true meaning of romance, which is sticking by your partner through thick and thin, and not leaving their side no matter what kind of trouble they get themselves into. And Alabama is just that kind of person for Clarence. These two characters are not good people, they are ruthless and violent in every way, but they are no doubt in love. And this gives True Romance an ironic greatness that you just don't see work in all films. If you want an exciting and tons of fun experience, watch True Romance.

Brooks and stars William Hurt, Albert Brooks, and Holly Hunter. The film takes place in a modern day Washington News Station.Jane Craig (Hunter) is a news producer for a network television and despises the new trend of news stories being about entertainment rather than actual news. At the news station there are two reporters, Tom Grunick (Hurt) and Aaron Altman (Brooks), and both are very attracted to Jane Craig. Tom Grunick is an extremely handsome man but is all about style and Aaron Altman is an average looking guy but is very intelligent and funny. Jane Craig much determine which one she wants to date while the network is having a twenty-four million dollar budget cut where many jobs will be lost. Who will Jane choose, the style, or the substance? The screenplay by James L. Brooks was full of laughs and kept you wondering who Jane was going to be with until the very end. The characterization in this film was fantastic, I felt for all three of the leads and understood exactly what they were going through. Everyone hated Tom Grunick for being a stylish, entertaining guy but they all knew he was nice at heart. Everyone liked Aaron Altman but never gave him anything he ever wanted because he just didn't have the looks for the part. And everyone loved Jane Craig because she was organized, but crazy in her organization. Everything about this film was realistic. The only problem I had with this film was the ending, I disliked it so much I took a point off its rating.James L. Brooks direction matched his writing in quality, making the film very entertaining and a fun watch. He succeeded in showing the stress of a network station's craziness during the filming of the news, and that is when all the best comedy came out. There was nothing too impressive shot wise with this film, even though Brooks knew how to get the audience attached to the characters through his shots as well, but that is hard to describe how he did that. Brooks got fantastic performances from all his leads, and that is the main reason this film is going to be remembered as one of the great comedies.All three leads of this film received acting nominations at the Academy Awards. William Hurt received his for Best Actor and he deserved the nomination for the not too smart news caster with the good looks. Yet while being not too smart he was extremely likable and a character that I wanted to be happy at the end of the film. Some of Hurt's facial expressions were just great when they were extreme close ups on him, they just made him seem so sentimental and real. Albert Brooks received his nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and he provided many laughs the whole way through. But also he was a very deep, well constructed character that I also wanted to end up being happy. For both of them to be happy though they needed to be with Jane, and that just couldn't happen. Holly Hunter gave the strongest performance in the film and was nominated for Best Actress. She was perfect in being a frantic woman who just wanted some peace and a boyfriend that can make her happy when she got home. Her best acting was in the newsroom when she is screaming at people to get things done. The supporting cast of the film all gave good performances, especially a young Joan Cusack.Overall I give this film a 7\/10 because it is very entertaining and has a lot of funny moments in it. If the film had a better ending I would have given it an 8\/10, but unfortunately it didn't. If you've never seen a good William Hurt or Holly Hunter film, this is one of the many to see. Both of them are fantastic and shine in this film. I recommend this also to anyone who likes romantic comedies, but not those corny stupid ones from today, this one is good.

The film takes place in a modern day Washington News Station.Jane Craig (Hunter) is a news producer for a network television and despises the new trend of news stories being about entertainment rather than actual news. At the news station there are two reporters, Tom Grunick (Hurt) and Aaron Altman (Brooks), and both are very attracted to Jane Craig. Tom Grunick is an extremely handsome man but is all about style and Aaron Altman is an average looking guy but is very intelligent and funny. Jane Craig much determine which one she wants to date while the network is having a twenty-four million dollar budget cut where many jobs will be lost. Who will Jane choose, the style, or the substance? The screenplay by James L. Brooks was full of laughs and kept you wondering who Jane was going to be with until the very end. The characterization in this film was fantastic, I felt for all three of the leads and understood exactly what they were going through. Everyone hated Tom Grunick for being a stylish, entertaining guy but they all knew he was nice at heart. Everyone liked Aaron Altman but never gave him anything he ever wanted because he just didn't have the looks for the part. And everyone loved Jane Craig because she was organized, but crazy in her organization. Everything about this film was realistic.

Long before their masterpieces of Fargo and No Country for Old Men, these two already knew how to baffle an audience. For laughs just read Roger Ebert's clueless review. He had no idea what he was watching or how to review it. If he saw it for the first time today he'd no doubt award it at least 3 1\/2 of 4 stars. But since they only had Blood Simple under their belts at this point, Ebert obviously didn't feel obligated to give Raising Arizona anything more than a quick dismissal. I must admit I was originally baffled by these characters too, but the film had such energy, funny physical comedy, and incredible camera work that I was compelled to see it as many times as it took to appreciate it.The plot centers around Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter who are newlyweds unable to conceive children. Hunter was a policewoman who got to know Cage over the many times he was arrested for robbing convenience stores. It was her job to take the mugshot photos of incoming crooks and the two took a serious liking to one another over the years. And his criminal record puts adoption out of the question. Though Cage figures their respective records should simply cancel each other out. Anyway, the couple resorts to kidnapping one of five babies born to a furniture magnate and his wife after she took several fertility treatments. Complicating things are two of Cage's old prison buddies who break out of jail and attempt to kidnap the little tyke for themselves. And there is a true oddity of a character in the form of a sadistic biker\/bounty hunter also looking for the child. Ex-boxer Randall Tex Cobb plays him and he is almost a precursor to the Anton Chigurh character of No Country. Only he's a lot uglier and dirtier.The film doesn't last long and is mostly and assortment of chase scenes and slapstick that generally find their mark. There is about a five minute chase scene at the center of the film that will have you howling right along with the yodeler on the soundtrack. The actors are given some truly odd characters to play, but they generally do a good job with them. Frances McDormand may have been too over-the-top however. Her role is brief however. Cage is allowed to do what he does best in many scenes.... wig out! In a script which calls for a lot of yelling, he yells perhaps the loudest. The late Trey Wilson, who plays the furniture giant, pretty much steals all of his scenes. Certainly his lines are funniest. If you haven't seen this one for a while, you may want to see it again.

This is a film by someone steeped in the tradition of the best film noir, and though not a style one associates with Polanski, his sense of drama and of pacing, and his painstaking care to make every shot add to the overall atmosphere, is perfectly suited. Though lacking the distinctive low viewpoints, close-ups and heavy shadows of traditional film noir, this is one of the few later films which manage perfectly to capture the atmosphere and the understated tension of the genre.The writing and the acting, too, is straight out of the best tradition of film noir. Robert Towne's excellent Oscar-winning script, written with Jack Nicholson in mind for the central character of LA private detective J.J.Gittes, is written entirely from Gittes' perspective (I don't believe there's a single scene in which he doesn't figure). If Bogart was the epitome of Chandler's Marlowe in the 40's, then Nicholson is a worthy successor, and I wonder whether Towne ever considered writing another screenplay around the same character. When I first saw this film when it came out, I hadn't seen Nicholson before, and I remember being just blown away (I didn't see Easy Rider until a couple of years later). Faye Dunaway and the superbly cast John Huston complete the triangle, and we only discover their relative roles in the mystery as Gittes gradually pieces the complex jigsaw together, which of course is just how it should be. The supporting actors are more than adequate, secondary to the story but never detracting from it, with Perry Lopez doing a great job as the struggling but confident lieutenant (who of course is a former colleague of Gittes).But for me, Polanski himself is the star of this film (and I don't mean his nice little cameo part). I'm glad he wasn't tempted to shoot in black-and-white, though it wouldn't have been out of place -- the consistently washed-out colour so well delivers the sense of the heat and the desert (only the blue of the ocean and the bright lights of Chinatown itself stand out), and his choice of shot, variety of speed, and attention to detail never distract the viewer, nor detract from the acting and the unfolding tale. It's only after the film is over, when you sit back in admiration, that you realise there really wasn't a single moment when you were impatient to move on, or lost track of the plot, or felt a wrong note had been hit.

The supporting actors are more than adequate, secondary to the story but never detracting from it, with Perry Lopez doing a great job as the struggling but confident lieutenant (who of course is a former colleague of Gittes).But for me, Polanski himself is the star of this film (and I don't mean his nice little cameo part). I'm glad he wasn't tempted to shoot in black-and-white, though it wouldn't have been out of place -- the consistently washed-out colour so well delivers the sense of the heat and the desert (only the blue of the ocean and the bright lights of Chinatown itself stand out), and his choice of shot, variety of speed, and attention to detail never distract the viewer, nor detract from the acting and the unfolding tale. It's only after the film is over, when you sit back in admiration, that you realise there really wasn't a single moment when you were impatient to move on, or lost track of the plot, or felt a wrong note had been hit. I regard this, along with his recent superb version of Oliver Twist, to be his best works. And that's not an easy choice to make.

Also in the book the captain of the team is called Marcelo Perez. Another confusion i have is with the supposedly mad engineer. Who is he? And was that just for dramatisation purposes? Surely this book does not need anything added to it!Lastly i was a bit disappointed they did not show the point when Parrado and Canessa meet with the first people and also their first meal. Another amazing part of the book was when they meet their families again. Also a disappointment. Also, understandably, the search effort by their parents was left out as a two hour film can only be so long, i understand why it was not included. Overall i think this is a fantastic true story that will be told again and again. If you thought this was good read the book.

The acting is good and the methods of murder that the killer uses in this film are creative and interesting. The Bone Collecter may not be the best thriller of the nineties but it definitely is one of them. Partly because of its classic and smart ending and its creative and originally good plot that involves a young female cop who is trying to catch a serial killer, using the help of paraplegic cop Lincholn Rhyme.What I admire most about The Bone Collector is the way in which it is so original. It does not steal ideas from other movies and everything in The Bone Collector is totally original and scary. What The Bone Collector could use though is a little bit of a better ending. In the ending, some of the things that happen appear to be really stupid. But it still has a decent ending despite some of the things that happen in it.The acting in The Bone Collector is good, but not great. Apart from the brilliant performance from Leland Orser. Although he only appears in two scenes, he still does really well.Overall, The Bone Collector does not reach the brilliance of some other 1990's thriller films like Seven, Pulp Fiction and The Sixth Sense.

Basically it is the 41st Century, the year is 40,000, and after an in-flight anti-gravity striptease, astronaut Barbarella (Jane Fonda) is assigned by the President of Earth (Claude Dauphin) to find Doctor Durand-Durand (Milo O'Shea). The Doctor is the inventor of the Positronic Ray weapon which could threaten Earth and universal peace, so she goes to Tau Ceti and the city of Sogo, where sins are invented every hour. Over time and changing outfit after outfit, Barbarella encounters cannibalistic dolls, has penetrative sex with men instead of with Exaultation Transference Pills as a thank you for saving her life, and meets and starts falling for blind angel Pygar (John Phillip Law). There is a point when she meets the mysterious Concierge, not realising that he is Durand-Durand, who is in cahoots with The Great Tyrant, the Black Queen (Anita Pallenberg, dubbed by Joan Greenwood), a lesbian ruler who can make her fantasies come to life. After escaping both the Excessive Machine (sometimes mistakenly called the Orgasmatron), an organ instrument machine that kills you by giving you the pleasure of an orgasm, and a dream chamber, Barbarella still has to save the world. In the end, Barbarella activates a machine that destroys both Durand-Durand and the world they are standing on, but not without being saved by Pygar, along with the Tyrant, turned good. Also starring Blowup's David Hemmings as Dildano, Marcel Marceau as Professor Ping, Catherine Chevallier as Stomoxys, Serge Marquand as Captain Sun and Véronique Vendell as Captain Moon. It should be mentioned, in case you didn't already know, that this is indeed the film that inspired the name for the successful British New Wave band, Duran Duran.
