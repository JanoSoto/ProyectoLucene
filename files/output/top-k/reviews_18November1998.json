In spite of how closely Demme followed the plot of Beloved, much of the story is left out.  The novel contains thoughts behind the actions, which reveal character and help to tell the story.  It is these thoughts juxtaposed with the characters' actions, in my opinion, that makes the novel such a success.  It allows the reader to see how characters, Sethe and Denver most specifically, react to and because of their actions.  And for the most part, this is totally missed in the film, for two main reasons that I see.First, as much as I like Oprah Winfrey and as proud as I am of her in chasing her dreams in playing Sethe and helping to produce this novel that is apparently so close to her heart, she is not the caliber of actor necessary for such a part.  To make Beloved work on screen, Johnathan Demme needed to have an amazing performance from a great actress who could show the audience a world about Sethe in a single shot, in a close-up of her eyes perhaps.  Ones that come to mind who are successful in this are Jack Nicholson (especially in Terms of Endearment, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, A Few Good Men, and As Good as it Gets) and Meryl Streep (especially in Out of Africa, Kramer vs. Kramer, and Silkwood).  The audience can feel exactly how these characters are feeling, and for that crucial instant, forget they are actually watching actors, and feel as though they are seeing the characters.  Unfortunately for Demme and the entire Beloved production team, Oprah Winfrey is just not one of these actors.  Watching Oprah play Sethe is like watching a woman who really loves the character Sethe, rather than watching Sethe.  Flashes of brilliance come from the two young actresses who play Beloved and Denver, Thandie Newton and Kimberly Elise, who clearly upstage Winfrey in all aspects of acting.  Side Note Demme's most well-known successes, 1992 Best Picture Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia had the likes of Best Actress, Jodie Foster, Best Actor, Sir Anthony Hopkins, and Best Actor, Tom Hanks acting in front of the camera. Apparently when it comes to Demme's films, the proof is in the pudding.Second, much of the failure of the film adaptation is due to the manner in which Morrison's story, Beloved, is told.  Great accuracy with the plot is no excuse for the absence of her artistic achievement.  Morrison's characters' thoughts are left out in many crucial places and feelings often appear forced, much of which occurs due to editing.  One example that comes to mind, is the scene in which Paul D convinces Sethe to bring Denver and go to the carnival with him to spend his two dollars.  In the movie, Winfrey says, I don't know, smiles ever so slightly, turns and walks away.  Not bad, if Demme gives the audience some time to see the smile and how happy Sethe is that Paul D is there with her, the way the book does.  Not even close.  As soon as she turns to walk away, the audience is treated to one of the umpteen-hundred fade-to-blacks that extends and chops-up the already long film.  The book reads, 'No' is what she said.  At least what she started out saying (what would her boss say if she took a day off?), but even when she said it she was thinking how much her eyes enjoyed looking in his face.  My point is evident On screen, the effect is missed.  It is these omissions of crucial character development through thoughts and intangibles that both Winfrey's acting and Demme's direction fail to address, leaving the audience cheated out of Morrison's wonderfully told story.  I understand my suggestion to make the film longer to include necessary components of the story should be made with caution, for the movie nearly surpasses that epic mark of 180 minutes.  However, Beloved won a Pulitzer Prize, and I am pretty sure there is no asterisk by it in the record books saying that it had too many words; they were all necessary.Which brings me to my final point, that being the argument against making this story into a movie.  Make no mistake, it is a difficult story to tell, on-screen or off, but Morrison's writing of the characters' thoughts and feelings is such an essential part of the story in my mind, that it absolutely should have been included.  It should have been shown either through acting, the harder of the two methods, or possibly through a voice-over. When I read Beloved, I heard the narrator speaking, and though a voice-over narration to supplement acting is sometimes considered weak in filmmaking, I think Beloved was a perfect film for it.  If I had a quarter for every time I wanted to hear Maya Angelou's voice start come over the loudspeaker revealing the poetic thoughts of Sethe, I could have retired by the film's end.  A beautiful, recognizable narration by long-time Winfrey friends Angelou or even Morrison herself (for publicity's sake alone) would have been a valuable asset to the film, and possibly spared Touchstone, Demme, and Winfrey the embarrassment it will ensue.

So I must warn you, my comments may not be ENTIRELY objective, but what the heck, right?This is a very cool, somewhat campy movie consisting of Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, and Adrienne Barbeau (back in the day when her and Johnny boy were hitched).  The plot is sorta corny, I'll admit (ghost pirates... oooh scary!) but John Carpenter Pulls it off so well!  The tension mounts as strange occurrences begin happening (a gold coin turns into a piece of driftwood, which has the word DANE on it, which later Re-letters itself to 6 MUST DIE, fog that goes against the wind, mysterious disappearances, the works).I'm telling you, this movie is just a lot of fun to watch.  I saw it for the first time a few years ago on that oh so wonderful show Monster Vision on TNT, and I haven't been able to get over how cool this movie is.  If you're a fan of horror movies, love suspense, but don't like a whole lot of gore (Carpenter rarely uses a lot of blood in his movies) or just looking for a cool movie to watch with friends and loved ones, THE FOG is your ticket, go out and rent it today... trust me, if you don't like it, I'll...

The film had a few good sadistic splatter laughs too (the opening scene, the garage door) but they were too few and far between.

During the filming of every movie in which he starred, River attached himself closely to someone else involved as a mentor and father figure. In the case of Stand by Me, this role was played by Robert Reiner, the director (who had wisely prepared his four principals before screening with adventure-wilderness-type activities of the same kind, in order to get them to bond. It worked!)During several takes of the milk-money confession scene, River had been unconvincing. Then Reiner asked River to think of a time in his own life when an adult had betrayed him. The result is what we see now-- what turns out to be one of the climactic moments of the film, although perhaps it needn't have been. And the biographer says that when the cameras stopped rolling, River's tears didn't. He kept sobbing and crying uncontrollably, until Reiner comforted him in his arms.

It's one of the few brainless comedies I've seen which doesn't rely on jokes about bodily functions to pull it through.  Granted, Adam Sandler is awfully irritating, but there are enough other charming characters--especially the underrated Henry Winkler as the Coach--to carry the film along.  Of course we all know what's coming at the end, but this film is, after all, a parody, and it pokes fun at feel-good sports movies with a much sharper focus than last summer's Baseketball.

It is no Welsh Trainspotting, only marketing people will say that and consequently only the foolish will believe that. It is not even from the makers of Trainspotting as the US marketeers are currently trying to claim. It is a film that is to Wales what Trainspotting is to Scotland but that is really where the similarities end. Twin Town is much more of a comedy, and is much more difficult to understand, particularly if you're not familiar with welsh accents. The plot is nothing new, an ever escalating battle of revenge but it is the location and script which set it apart. Port Talbot is far more depressing a place to live than Glasgow could ever be. The chances of Port Talbot (or even Swansea for that matter) being called a European City of Culture are more remote than the Pope turning out to be Elvis. The Lewis Twins are synonymous with Wales in the 90s, poverty stricken, joyriding drug addicts. And yet there is something lovable about them, something heroic.You can sit back and laugh at this film if you're not welsh, or you could be utterly confused for two hours because unlike Trainspotting, the accents are not toned down for American audiences. However, if you are Welsh, Twin Town will speak to you like no other film you can remember. The ending is a thing of beauty, I only wish Terry the bent copper could have been English.....
