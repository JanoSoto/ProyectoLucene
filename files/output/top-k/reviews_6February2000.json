[{"date":"6 February 2000","score":"","review":"  I saw this movie when it first hit theaters and then again on video a year later.  The first time I saw it I remember hating it and I couldn't understand why it became such a cult classic with practically everybody.  I seemed to enjoy it a bit more on the small screen, perhaps because of the new venue, it seemed a bit slicker than what I recall, however, I can't get past the fact that Keanu Reeves is a lousy actor, and what's worse, that The Matrix is a great idea gone horribly wrong.The Matrix is the story of a computer geek who sells bootleg software to the underground market.  We are never quite sure what he is selling, but we know it must be good because his clients are paying top dollar to get it.  Reeves is Neo, an unsatisfied software pusher who is contacted via his computer, by a group of action heroes who are somehow able to dodge bullets and clobber anyone in their path.  These hooligans, headed up by Laurence Fishbourne, claim that they need Neo's help, and promise him the truth that he has been searching for.  Before he can make up his mind, the authorities are hot on his trail, threatening untold danger if he doesn't turn his new friends in. Neo is offered the truth in the form of a pill, a la Alice in Wonderland.  One pill will show him the light, the other will allow him to return to his day to day world.  Of course he chooses the light.  The light, as it turns out, is that we are living a false life.  We are actually hundreds of years ahead and we are being kept in a state of incubus.  Our minds are controlled by a computer program that lets us imagine that we a members of the 20th century.  And that's just the beginning.  The Matrix is a nicely styled action flick, offering some neat special effects and a seemingly cool plot.  As stories go, this one is brilliant.  But The Matrix is far from perfect.Let's start off with Keanu.  As one of the worst actors ever to rise out of Hollywood, this guy grunts and groans his way through his part, acting as an extension of his old Bill and Ted character.  For an action star this would normally be fine, but Reeves takes himself far too seriously (as usual) and his deadpan wit is no where near as funny as his contemporary, Arnold Schwarzengger.  What's worse than Keanu's bad acting?  Well, his bad acting happens to be the best acting in the entire film.  All of the supporting stars, including Fishbourne, over act their way into oblivion, making what should have been an interesting premise, seem silly and trite.  And just when you think it can't get any worse, the big finale arrives.  I got the feeling that the writers\/producers ran out of neat ideas, or perhaps they just felt that this was going no where so they decided to really screw things up.  I won't spoil it, except to say that this flick turns from being too serious to being too outrageous.In the end, The Matrix is nothing but a big let down.  However, I can't argue with the overwhelming response from fans everywhere who have already taken this film to cult-like status.  Maybe I'm just not in touch with today's movie going public.  Or maybe I just took a different pill than everyone else.

He does ok with comedic roles, but that's about it, and in 8MM, > he just doesn't get the job done. His acting style does not vary--it's just seething looks and angry outbursts--and we never get a feel for the man behind the investigator.As for the movie itself, well it's certainly dark, but that does not make it good. First of all it makes SMBD culture look perverted and dangerous, something that has already been portrayed in the media and does not need any help from clueless directors. People can wear leather masks and not be psychopathic killers, but you would never know that from this horrible movie.Second, all this noise about this movie containing the message that just because a person looks 'normal' does not mean they are not a psychopathic killer is a pretty sad bit of praise.

The first part is a breezy romantic comedy, one which is exceedingly well-done clever, goofy, big-hearted and a lot of fun. It resurrects the style of the old silent classics like Chaplin and Keaton and adapts it for modern day audiences. And Roberto Benigni is a first rate clown - a hangdog mixture of Woody Allen and Kramer from Seinfeld. If you were to turn off this movie after the first hour, you would have gotten your money's worth.However, if you stick around for the second part you'll likely want your money back - as well as a full public apology from Benigni for being such a moral retard. For, once he and his son are rounded up by the Nazis and sent to a concentration camp, the movie turns into one of the biggest travesties in the history of cinema. Just who was the idiot who allowed Benigni to introduce something as weighty as the Holocaust into this whimsical and paper-thin world? Inflicting Bugs Bunny or Charlie Brown with AIDS would make about as much sense.Now, I've heard this film defended as being a fable - as if to say, Well, straight forward realism isn't what Benigni was going for. Well I'm sorry, but if straight forward realism isn't what you're going for, then you DON'T use the Holocaust as your backdrop; it is too real and horrific an event to yield its place to fables and fairy tales. Once you're a stone's throw away from the ovens, the logic of a cartoon world just does not hold up. And, sadly, it is only by such cartoon logic that we can conceive of Benigni keeping his son so well insulated from the horrors going on all around him. Implausibilities just pile up here like so many dead Jews (you find that phrasing offensive? Welcome to the world of Life Is Beautiful) the opening sequence with the guard, where Benigni pretends to translate his German - wouldn't any of the other inmates have commented upon how illogical his spiel was, and thereby alert the guard that he wasn't being translated properly (and, further, didn't this whole scene play like an egregious Hogan's Heroes rerun? Just what we need, a sitcom set in a concentration camp); and is it logical to assume that the kid would stay so well-hidden in his barracks all day, or that no guard would ever search the top bunks to find him?; how about the supremely idiotic moment when Guido (Benigni's character name) gets on the camp loudspeaker to say hello to his wife? Under normal circumstances, the schmaltz of this scene would merely be laughable, but the context of the Holocaust makes it instead deeply offensive. To which Benigni adds stupidity in the next moment by allowing the kid to get on as well isn't the whole point to *hide* the kid, so that the guards don't realize he's still alive? Of course, Benigni knows he doesn't have to worry about them finding his son - after all, since he wrote the script, those guards will only do what he tells them to do, logic and history be damned.For that is exactly what Benigni is doing here he's damning history, showing a cavalier disregard for facts. Yes, I can imagine him saying, I know six million were murdered, but I don't like that ending. I'll write my own upbeat version of the truth. Of course, that's precisely what Guido does with his son he creates his own version of the truth, lying in order to shield the boy from the true horror of their situation. Ok, forget for a moment the plausibility of keeping up such a charade and instead ask yourself this Is that such a good idea? I mean, after all, if the kid truly doesn't know the danger he's in, how can he protect himself? This is the same kind of logic that grownups use so frequently to lie to their young kids about death or divorce, or any other similarly weighty topics - almost always to the detriment of the child later in life. So not only is Guido's deceiving of his son not noble or touching - it's actually downright dangerous. Furthermore, even on a purely symbolic level, the notion that innocence could somehow be preserved amidst the horror of the Holocaust is an outright lie, and a truly insidious one. Anyone who's read Elie Wiesel's Night, where he describes his childhood years inside a camp and the bitter toll they took upon his faith and his sense of justice in the world, would understand the true depth of this lie.To sum up, I have to be a little nasty. Normally, I'm a strong believer in to each his own, particularly when it comes to movies. If you like something and I don't, or vice versa, we can argue about it, but ultimately we're each entitled to our opinions. Not here. The subject portrayed is so monumental, and its treatment so facile, that if you like this movie I have to say that there is something seriously wrong with you. Either you're a moral retard like Benigni, or you know nothing about the Holocaust, or you are far too easily manipulated into crying on cue and getting all warm and emotional inside that you lose sight of the depths to which the filmmakers are sinking. I don't know how this movie got such nearly unanimous across-the board support, whereas only a few short years ago Schindler's List opened a large debate concerning the ability of films to accurately portray the Holocaust. Could it be that this film's refusal of an accurate portrayal - in favor of its fable approach - is what makes it so palatable? Are we ready now to sugarcoat the Holocaust, make it less of a downer?

Her performance probably owes something to Betty  Hutton's Annie Oakley, and it looks an awful lot  like what Billie Hayes and Irene Ryan had been doing  years afterwards, but Day dons a buckskin suit and  tears right into the role like it was a tailor's  fit.  I don't think I have to go into the rumor about the  real Calamity Jane to point out how daring Day's  work is.  Hollywood might have sanitized history (or  maybe not), but Day is as close to being Martha Jane  Canary as anyone is likely to be in a time when drag  acts were something no one ever talked about.  And  she is lucky to have some of the best movie music of  that year (or maybe any year when you consider what  now passes for good).  Sammy Fain and John Francis  Webster took the Oscar for best song, yet the ones  that weren't in the running are every bit as good.How can you pass up a musical that delivers the  deeply satisfying baritone of Howard Keel?  When he  bursts out with joy in Higher than a Hawk, the  light from the screen surges, and you feel like  you're resting on a sunlit cloud right next to his.   His smile matches Day's for brightness, and as they  ride through the Black Hills singing harmony, even  the birds seemed to have stopped to listen.  It's a  beautiful pairing that I don't think ever happened  again.Calamity Jane may not be everyone's cup of tea.   If you're looking for history, this is not the place  to go.  But stop by, and Day and Keel and Dick  Wesson and Allyn Ann McLerie and Paul Harvey and  company will more than tickle your fancy.  They'll  keep you humming for days.Directed by David Butler who has given us over the  years a string of felicitous moments to remember  from Will Rogers in A Connecticut Yankee, to Jane Withers in Bright Eyes, to the Ritz Brothers in Kentucky Moonshine, to Bob Hope in Road to Morocco, to S.Z. Sakall in Lullaby of Broadway and on and on and on.

Drew Barrymore gets her opportunity with Never Been Kissed, the story of a twenty-something misfit who returns to high school.Drew is Josie Geller, a grammar-nut working as the copy editor for a Chicago newspaper.  She isn't crazy about her job, her life is in a rut, and most remarkable of all, she has never been kissed.  Josie's big dream, other than finding her prince, is to take on an undercover assignment.  After much begging, she is suddenly offered the chance to pose as a high school student to get the straight dope on what America's kids are up to these days.  A thrilling opportunity?  No.  However, just the opportunity this vehicle needs to get Drew back into high school.As a teenager, Josie was hugely unpopular, and her crush on a classmate was fodder for the terrible pranks her school mates played on her.  As she returns to high school, Josie finds that things haven't changed much, and before long her awkward personality gets her lumped in with the unpopular kids.  Never Been Kissed is about as predictable and contrived a plot you could hope for.  We know instantly that the hot young English teacher is going to be the big love interest in the film.  We also know that Drew is going to soon have to make a choice between the class geeks and the princesses.  And of course, we are never surprised by any of the choices she makes. Drew Barrymore plays a bit of a character role here.  As a clumsy oaf she pulls it off ... barely.  While she manages to look the part, sometimes dowdy, sometimes ugly, I still suggest that she spend a bit more time with an acting coach.Molly Shannan plays her over sexed best friend in a supporting role complete with a sub-plot that is (thankfully) never realized.  As Josie recounts her dream of being kissed by Mr Right, hot-to-trot Shannon is reduced to tears.  I didn't buy any of it for a second.I must admit, that despite its faults, I did enjoy Never Been Kissed.  A predictable piece of fluff, this film has some cute moments, and while the premise is unbelievably forced it is never dull.  Even though she has a long way to go before she can call herself one of the great Barrymore's, Drew is fun to watch, and this no-brainer serves as a perfect time waster should the need arise.

I also knew that it was possible this time that the three main characters, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) could die. So I didn't know what to expect, and my expectations might have been higher for SCREAM 3 than the others. After all, this is supposed to be the grand finale, as advertised. I was not disappointed.Stab 3, the movie series based on the stories that happened in the last two SCREAM movies, is only days away from opening. But then the murders start again. Sidney Prescott, who has gone into hiding, is discovered by the killer. She goes to find Dewey for protection. Gale Weathers also returns when she learns of what is going on. Cast members of the Stab 3 movie start to get killed as the killer, straight out of Sidney's past, closes in on Sidney for the grand finale.I thought this story line was better than in SCREAM 2 because it was not too similar to that of SCREAM, which SCREAM 2 was. This movie really had the grand finale feel (and I know all about how Kevin Williamson didn't return for SCREAM 3, so if they do make a Scream 4, I don't think it will work) and, although the plot was similar, it seemed to be more of it's own movie than SCREAM 2 was.The acting was just as good as in SCREAM and SCREAM 2. Cambell, Arquette and Cox did their usual good jobs. The small part that SCREAM 2's victim Randy Meeks, played by Jamie Kennedy, did on video was priceless. It was one of my favorite parts of the movie, if not my absolute favorite. Scott Foley did an excellent job. The cameo-like parts done by Lance Henriksen and Carrie Fisher were cool and Liev Schreiber did an OK job for the small part he had. And of course, Roger L.

These double-features were primarily low budget sci-fi\/horror epics with slender threads of plot, lovely damsels in distress (Beverly Garland, Barbara Rush), square-jawed heroes (Peter Graves, Richard Carlson) and budget monsters from Mars, the grave, melted icebergs, mad scientist's labs or atomic fallout. Well not really. The monsters were usually guys in rubber suits (Creature From The Black Lagoon, This Island Earth), or cheap trick photography (Tarantula, Attack of the 50 Ft Woman), or  Mask and Glove illusion (I Was A Teenage Werewolf\/Frankenstein, Monster On The Campus), or, if we were really lucky, a Ray Harryhausen stop motion creation.Needless to say this wasn't great cinema, but what it WAS, was a great fun time. Were you scared? Not really. Did you have the need for everything to be fact-based and believable? Of course not! You went to be entertained, to let your imagination merge with the sounds and images and have a good time, laughing or screaming. Could anyone really take the monster from It Conquered The World seriously, or wonder whether The Creature From The Black Lagoon was biologically possible or if it could anatomically deflower Julie Adams? Didn't matter. Instead, you let yourself meld into the film's world and travel along for the ride.Thus whether you were on the obviously and badly animated Angry Red Planet, or trapped with James Best on the island of dogs in make-up which were trying to pass for The Killer Shrews, you surrendered to the magic.My heart weeps for the post Star Wars filmgoers, these people weaned on special effects, the MTVers and video viewers who've had their imaginations and attention spans kidnapped and are told what to see and how to interpret it. I truly am sorry. You people missed a modern day, Grade B double feature, sci-fi\/horror classic called Anaconda. And we hadn't seen one this good since Alien.Being an intelligent man, I realize the futility of convincing the non-believers who can't draw from the needed background reservoir to understand, so I won't bother preaching this film's virtues or try to win you over by fact and argument. This, however, is what I will say...This is a brilliant re-creation of the lost art of the 1950's double-feature sci-fi\/horror genre; not really a homage to, more the real thing. It's Creature From The Black Lagoon, with a really cheesy computer animated snake in place of a guy in a really cheesy rubber suit. It's a Saturday afternoon classic for people who remember and understand them. Story is great, script is great, cinematography is great, direction is great, acting is great, the women beautiful and endangered, the heroes machismo and handsome, the monster phantasmagorical, and we get a bonus surprise by one of the greatest American actors, Jon Voight, doing a magnificent over-the-top, slimy, nasty, reprehensibly heartless villain, complete with sly wink to the audience. His performance is the key to the film. He understood the film's intent and translated it to the screen for you. If it's in your realm of understanding and experience, you get it and are able to partake in this little slice of cinema heaven.In 20 years, they'll be calling this a classic.

These double-features were primarily low budget sci-fi\/horror epics with slender threads of plot, lovely damsels in distress (Beverly Garland, Barbara Rush), square-jawed heroes (Peter Graves, Richard Carlson) and budget monsters from Mars, the grave, melted icebergs, mad scientist's labs or atomic fallout. Well not really. The monsters were usually guys in rubber suits (Creature From The Black Lagoon, This Island Earth), or cheap trick photography (Tarantula, Attack of the 50 Ft Woman), or  Mask and Glove illusion (I Was A Teenage Werewolf\/Frankenstein, Monster On The Campus), or, if we were really lucky, a Ray Harryhausen stop motion creation.Needless to say this wasn't great cinema, but what it WAS, was a great fun time. Were you scared? Not really. Did you have the need for everything to be fact-based and believable? Of course not! You went to be entertained, to let your imagination merge with the sounds and images and have a good time, laughing or screaming. Could anyone really take the monster from It Conquered The World seriously, or wonder whether The Creature From The Black Lagoon was biologically possible or if it could anatomically deflower Julie Adams? Didn't matter. Instead, you let yourself meld into the film's world and travel along for the ride.Thus whether you were on the obviously and badly animated Angry Red Planet, or trapped with James Best on the island of dogs in make-up which were trying to pass for The Killer Shrews, you surrendered to the magic.My heart weeps for the post Star Wars filmgoers, these people weaned on special effects, the MTVers and video viewers who've had their imaginations and attention spans kidnapped and are told what to see and how to interpret it. I truly am sorry. You people missed a modern day, Grade B double feature, sci-fi\/horror classic called Anaconda. And we hadn't seen one this good since Alien.Being an intelligent man, I realize the futility of convincing the non-believers who can't draw from the needed background reservoir to understand, so I won't bother preaching this film's virtues or try to win you over by fact and argument. This, however, is what I will say...This is a brilliant re-creation of the lost art of the 1950's double-feature sci-fi\/horror genre; not really a homage to, more the real thing. It's Creature From The Black Lagoon, with a really cheesy computer animated snake in place of a guy in a really cheesy rubber suit. It's a Saturday afternoon classic for people who remember and understand them. Story is great, script is great, cinematography is great, direction is great, acting is great, the women beautiful and endangered, the heroes machismo and handsome, the monster phantasmagorical, and we get a bonus surprise by one of the greatest American actors, Jon Voight, doing a magnificent over-the-top, slimy, nasty, reprehensibly heartless villain, complete with sly wink to the audience. His performance is the key to the film. He understood the film's intent and translated it to the screen for you. If it's in your realm of understanding and experience, you get it and are able to partake in this little slice of cinema heaven.In 20 years, they'll be calling this a classic. I'm calling it one now.  ","genre":"Adventure, Horror"},{"date":"6 February 2000","score":"","review":"  Scream 3 was slickly put together, but was all over the place. I'm not talking about the usual misdirection, of which there is plenty.

Did anyone really try to follow the script to figure out who would be killed next? Well ... no. But that was explained away quickly.Once again, we are treated to people who insist on splitting up whenever possible to explore the darkest of corners, including Sydney, who has been living sort of like a recluse in the hills. You would think she would be a little brighter by now after living in such fear. Speaking of which, she is also haunted by the spectre of her dead mother in this film. Or is she?Finally, the conclusion leaves MUCH to be desired, including the fact that it is totally inadequate in explaining how certain things could have taken place had the murderer(s) actually been the only one(s) involved in the murders. Certain things simply don't add up. Some of the new characters were simply added just so there would be people to kill instead of the primary players throughout the flick.The best things about this movie were the cameos. Carrie Fischer, Jenny McCarthy (don't worry, she isn't on-screen long enough to annoy you with her special brand of mental retardation), and Jay and Silent Bob.Overall, though, I would recommend this flick for Scream fans, or just basic horror fans. I didn't take the movie seriously, although I didn't find that it resolved as well in the end as the previous two seemed to. You don't go to these movies to have something to discuss over latte and croissants anyway. You don't even really go to be scared.

There are quite a few funny parts, but there are some jokes and gags that don't work. The acting is OK, even though Jim Carrey overacts way too much at this stage in his career.

Not only does Bertolucci mix elements of film noir and haunting surrealism, he is able to express his obsession with the illusion of reality. The film is based on the eponymous novel by Alberto Moravia, and although I have not had the pleasure to read it, I hear the film does not stray from the plot of the novel. Of course Bertolucci puts a spin on the chronology of the plot; allowing us to first see the film 2\/3 into the plot, we weave back and forth between the protagonist's childhood, his admittance into the Fascist party and then finally the present.The film follows Clerici's quest for normalcy and acceptance, since he views himself as abnormal and an outcast from society. If it means he must marry the airhead giulia (his ticket to bourgeois life) he will. He tries to conform to society, and in doing so joins the Fascist party the epitome of ideological conformity.The film is essentially about shadows in the cave, and the scene in which he meets up with his former professor is a direct allusion to Plato's myth. We see Clerici's shadow on the wall as professor Quadri recounts the myth. Clerici has been living his life, unable to exit this cave. He sees only shadows on caves, and instead of realizing they are merely shadows, lies, illusions, he remains imprisoned, like the prisoners in plato's cave. When the professor opens the window and light streams into the room, we believe this illumination will open Clerici's eyes. But he has failed to accept things that have happened in the past, and therefore is unable to grow up. He does not overcome his violent tendencies (he will take part in a conspiracy to kill Quadri since Quadri is an anti-Fascist in order to gain acceptance into the Fascist party) and lives forever boxed in that cave. The professor fails to illuminate Clerici because he is not the ideal Platonic hero has abandoned Rome when the Fascist regime begins to rise and leaves his Italian followers to their own devices. He has not been a hero of the resistance, preventing others from joining the ranks of such a disillusioned ideology because as Clerici states You left and I became a Fascist.Some have questioned the scene between a 13 year old Clerici and the homosexual chauffeur named Lino. Some one said why does he have sex and then shoot him? First of all, Lino propositioned him, an act of sodomy never occurred. Second, at 13, Clerici (like most budding pre-pubescents) was probably intrigued and curious and then immediately ashamed by the so-called deviance of homosexuality. He shoots him because he becomes enraged in his attraction to Lino and seeks to punish he who almost set off his unknown erotic impulses. This crime will never leave him as he then sees he must atone for this sin by committing another hence the murders of the Quadri and his wife (although she is not originally part of the conspiracy).Italo, his blind friend, is an ideologue, the embodiment of Facist theory. It is appropriate that he is blind, because those who followed the regime were blind and disillusioned. When they walk together down in the ranks of the coliseum, Clerici will once again place the blame on someone else for his crimes by accusing Italo of Fascist allegiance.

His dark style, present in a great part of his films, is just amazing and magical. Talking about magic, he is able to pass it to the audience in each of his films. In Batman and Batman Returns, he adapted very well the story of the man of shadows in Gotham City, what didn't happen in the two Joel Schumacher films. Edward Scissorhands is one of the most magical and sweet films of the '90s. In The Nightmare Before Christmas, Burton did an inventive and weird animated movie. In Ed Wood, maybe his best film to date, he could do a biographical story at the same time controversial and hilarious. And Mars Attacks... Well... It's his weakest film, but still that rather enjoyable. To repair this small mistake, he wonderfully adapted an old American tale- Sleepy Hollow- and did his great comeback.Sleepy Hollow tells the story of Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a New York detective who believes only in what he sees. He goes to a small village in order to investigate some strange decapitation murders. The inhabitants claim that they were commited by a weird creature who is part of the folk of the place- the 'headless horseman'. Crane, of course, doesn't believe in anything at first, but a childhood trauma and a romance can help him with his mission. I won't tell more things about the plot, because I don't want to spoil your surprises, and so that the film gets more enjoyable and intriguing to watch.It is difficult to say if Sleepy Hollow is Tim Burton's best. It doesn't have the sweetness of Edward Scissorhands, or the ingenuity of Ed Wood, but it is a very special film. It is original, dark, with a strange black humor and sometimes scary. If I had to define the genre of this movie, it would be fantasy. More than comedy, horror, mystery. Because, in the deep, it is beautiful- and don't forget there is a romance! The acting is fabulous, specially Depp and Christina Ricci- one of the greatest promises of Hollywood for the future. Its dark, wonderful cinematography is definetely Oscar-worthy, and so are the costumes, the art direction, the special effects and the make-up effects.Sleepy Hollow can be not of the 10 year's best, but it is one of the most enjoyable, exciting and entertaining films of last year.So prepare for some scares, much fun and a great twist in the end.

Let us meet the hunters one-by-one?  How can we care about a hotel room full of hookers & hunters if we don't even know their names?  How can we understand Crow's rage and anguish and motivation, when all we hear about his past are two or three lines of dialogue?   Three quarters of this movie is people looking menacingly at eachother, and people en route to doing something.  As well, I REALLY hated the way intense action scenes were presented in a sort of slow-motion montage that made me wonder if my VCR needed cleaning.  And the priest was miscast.  He made a good priest; as a hunter he was embarassing.That said, there were still some great scenes.  Sheryl Lee was almost transcendental in her ability to rise above her mundane role, but I think this has more to do with Sheryl Lee than it does with John Carpenter.

RIPLEY may be the finest film that Alfred Hitchcock never made. Or at least he would have, if he could be here today.Like the richest, creamiest zuppa you ever slurped from a spoon, Minghella and company paint the most dazzling, alluring and sensuous pictures of Italy I've ever seen on film; an idyllic ideal that makes it perfectly understandable why the character of Tom Ripley is motivated to do what he does later on.But as you scoop up the sumptuous feast of divine visuals from Minghella's brimming bowl, you begin to sense the aftertaste...the sourness of the pasta, just the faintest whiff of rot and corruption from the steaming vegetables...the way that the money and prestige that make this life affordable for the people that Ripley falls in with, taints everything with a bitter, jaded sense of ennui, soul-deadening hedonism and the opportunity to act upon the most sociopathic urges without fear of repercussion.In other words, Tom has become a garden snake entwined in a nest of rich vipers. Unbeknownst to them, however, his poison is just a touch deadlier than theirs.As portrayed so superbly by Matt Damon in a turn he gave way before the Damon\/Affleck Express started rolling in Hollywood, he shows us the neediness, the desperation, the cunning and the calculation of Ripley captured by Patricia Highsmith in her 1950's novel, by allowing us access to what went on inside Tom's head.Damon uses both the source material and Minghella's excellent screenplay to turn that inward life outward, and to show us why we're so fascinated and repelled by him all at once there's a little bit of Tom in all of us.Tom is mistaken for a former Ivy league classmate of Dickie Greenleaf, the son of a shipping magnate. Mr. Greenleaf (James Rebhorn), presses Tom into traveling to the town of Mongiobello, all expenses paid, to try to talk sense into Dickie and persuade him to return to his duties as the heir apparent of the Greenleaf empire.Down at the heels and reduced to scrambling to eke out a meager existence of which Greenleaf is unaware, the offer is irresistible to Tom. And the moment he arrives at Mongi, you can already tell that he's thinking about how to work this angle to the maximum advantage never having to return to the States while living on Mr. Greenleaf's dime.The last thought of leaving is completed obliterated when Tom finally lays eyes on Dickie, a tanned, toned and tasty bit of rich, spoiled brat, in a beautiful star-making turn by Jude Law, (a Golden Globe nominee for Best Supporting Actor.) Tom falls immediately head over heels for the man and the life that he leads, and the stage is set for the dark doings to come underneath the sun-dappled surface.As the Hitchcockian heroine of the piece, Gwyneth Paltrow is stunning as Marge Sherwood, Dickie's companion and sometime lover. Because her character possesses a kind of trusting naivete unusual for such a bunch of rich swells, the fire-and-ice allure of Hitch's former blond goddesses such as Kim Novak, Grace Kelly and Tippi Hedren is missing here.Not to say that Marge is incapable of expressing her sexuality, but the worldliness that counterbalanced the aloofness of the ice princesses before her would've allowed her to see through Ripley's machinations right away.One who does recognize it is Dickie's carousing chum Freddie Miles, (the ever-versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman). The very picture of priggish, callous, class-conscious snobbery and disdain, not only does he take offense at the convenience of Tom's situation, but at the very IDEA that someone so bourgeois could hob-nob with the likes of them.Having only read about a third of the source novel, I understand now why I found it filed under 'crime.' It doesn't take a genius to figure out as Ripley is drawn deeper into the lives of Dickie, Marge and their company, how important and vital it becomes to Tom to hold onto this wonderful new set of circumstances at any cost. With the talents of impersonation, invention, forgery and manipulation already well engrained in his amoral repertoire, why would murder seem such a fantastic stretch?Also worth mentioning are excellent performances by Cate Blanchett as Meredith, someone who becomes an unwitting partner-in-crime for Tom, and Jack Davenport as Peter, one of Marge's friends, and someone who holds as much attraction for Tom as Dickie does, and having become a part of his life, also becomes an unfortunate victim of Ripley's need to keep the secrets of that life intact.Combining undercurrents of death, desire, unrequited male love and lust and desperation with the picture-postcard landscape, you find THE TALENTED MR.
