The thing that introduced me to the Halloween franchise was seeing Halloween II and Halloween III on the USA Network each Halloween as a kid. For at least two or three years I would watch Halloween II, which picks up where Halloween 1 leaves off (the two are really meant to go together--more on that later) before ever viewing the original, and so for years I was only getting the second half of the original Halloween story.That having been said, when I finally was of age was able to rent the original Halloween, I remember feeling like it was an awfully slow movie. It wasn't as gory or as fast paced as some of the Freddy or Jason movies that came after it, and in fact one can make a good argument that its immediate successor, Halloween II, gives it a run for its money in the suspense and horror categories.But now, as an adult, and being a bit more well rounded and also more well read, I absolutely positively label this film as a brilliant film, and a true classic in most every sense of the word.Why is that so? Well, for starters, this movie came before A Nightmare on Elm Street, and before Friday the 13th (and, if you know anything about the Friday the 13th movies, you know that the Jason character wouldn't develop into a more Michael Myers-type of character until basically the third film in the franchise). In many senses, Halloween 1 is the original slasher movie. It spawned a whole generation of films. I say that as a movie buff more so than as a horror buff, and I'm sure that more prominent horror fans could and would point out Halloween's own influences. But regardless of that, when it comes to the 1980's slasher films that would follow, and when you consider that this film was released in 1978, it's clear that this movie had a lasting impact on a whole genre of films.Another point to make that adds to one's appreciation for the film is that if you go and read up on it, you'll learn that this was essentially an independent film that was pitched to a studio and made on a shoestring budget. That shows when you watch the movie. There's no real tremendous special effects here--it was made long before the days of computer generated graphics, and aside from a bit of blood and some creative ways of displaying the deceased in the film, there's not a lot to be said for special effects.What the film makes up for that with, though, is its cinematography. The camera angles, the use of shadows, and the use of sound (and theme music!) in this movie is just spectacular. It takes mundane elements of everyday life--or things that we all live with each and every NIGHT of our lives, for that matter--and turns the ordinary into the terrifying. That shadow in the corner? What could be there, hidden just beneath the darkness? That tree in the distance? Do you know what's on the other side of it? Those are the questions that Halloween will have you asking yourself for days after you watch the film.Finally, I'll say this brief word about Halloween 1 and 2. I've not marked this review as a spoiler, and so I'll be careful not to give away much here, but it's worth knowing going into this film that Halloween 2 picks up where Halloween 1 leaves off, and not just in a generic sense that most sequels would, but in that the sequel is set on the same night as Halloween 1, meaning that if one imagines the first movie ending at 11 pm or midnight (no exact time is given in the film), then Halloween 2 is the story of what happens between that point and dawn the next day.That having been said, I used to believe that Halloween 1 and 2 should be viewed together if at all possible, and I still think I'd make that case. Halloween 2 is an outstanding film, and too often it doesn't get the credit it deserves compared to the original, so I'd very much recommend seeing it as soon as possible after the first movie.However, having just seen this film in the theater for the first time in my life, I think I left with a newfound appreciation for it as a standalone thriller. As I said earlier in my review here, I was introduced to the franchise by seeing the sequel first, and for several years I never even knew what happened in the first movie to lead up to the sequel. I think that it was because of that that for many years I'd always find myself feeling like Halloween 1 was an incomplete movie. In a sense, I still feel that way, as the sequel adds a fair amount of character and plot development. And so, as such, I continue to argue that the two belong together.And yet, having now seen the film in a theater, this time around I could very much see how the first movie ends on a satisfying note. Indeed, the ending--particularly the last sixty seconds or so just before the credits roll--adds to the film's thrill factor. That's pretty much as much as I can say without spoiling things here. Suffice it to say that a first time viewer will find that the film is both brilliant in how it is self-contained, and yet at the same time my argument for why Halloween 1 & 2 belong together will be obvious to anyone who has ever seen both of the films.

For me, one such scenario I hope never to be placed under is being mistaken for another man to the point where it gets me into deep trouble. In able for me to explain to my readers why I do not desire to be put under such a circumstance, I must ask them to immediately go and see director Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 spy thriller North by Northwest as soon as they can. Not only will they be guaranteed to have an exciting time watching it, they will also be completely hooked into how the main character of this film almost constantly gets screwed. Our main character of North by Northwest is advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant). He is heavily mistaken for a man named George Kaplan and kidnapped by two men who work for spy Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Thinking that he's George, Phillip claims that Roger has been spying on his activities and hires his right-hand man Leonard (Martin Landau) to dispose of him. Though Roger is able to escape being killed by Phillip's men, he's also very drunk while driving home which gets him into deep trouble with the police. When he's unable to prove to his mother (Jessie Royce Landis) and the police what happened between him, Phillip and his right-hand men, Roger goes to search for this George Kaplan person himself to clear up this colossal misunderstanding. Through a series of ingenious plot developments, Roger finds himself going on the run and traveling all across the United States. Along the way, he meets a young, beautiful lady named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who helps him with solving his crisis and becomes his romantic interest. Little does he know however that Eve herself may be associated with Roger getting into this situation to begin with. Some have considered North by Northwest to be the first James Bond movie in that they share many similarities between each other. Among these similarities are that they both involve secret agents, multiple settings, a daring leading man, a worthy adversary, and a lovely romantic interest for our hero. Looking back at this film again, I can not only see how much the James Bond films were influenced by this film, I can also see how the TV show Mad Men could have been influenced by this. They both center on men who work in advertising, are untrustworthy in some way (according to their own family members), and they both fall in love with a woman they just met (Don Draper meets multiple women, but I digress). North by Northwest is more than a major influence on future films or shows of its genre and other genres, it's also perfect entertainment that stands the test of time many years later. From when Phillip's men first pick up Roger and start his nationwide adventure to the climax at Mount Rushmore and the brilliant payoff that proceeds it, this film is a jolly fun time all the way through. Hitchcock and screenwriter Ernest Lehman do an outstanding job at keeping the audience enthralled every step of the way with nail-biting suspense and classy dialogue. When Roger is on the train to Chicago with no ticket and the police all throughout the nation are going after him for a crime he didn't commit, that's gripping enough already. But Hitchcock and Lehman go even further than that. They also add a love story between him and a potential spy into the mix. Thanks to this subplot, we now start to ask ourselves questions regarding what will happen next. Will she stab him in the back and turn him in? What is her role in getting him entangled into this mess to begin with? Will she do what she can to protect him from being caught by the police? If so, how will she pull it off? In short, this romantic subplot is beneficial to the success of this story since it contributes significantly to the height of the film's drama as opposed to slowing it down. The romance also works splendidly because of the excellent chemistry between stars Grant and Saint. The exchanges of dialogue between them are outstanding, and the way the actors bounce off of each other seems completely natural to me. The first conversation they have on the train to Chicago, when they become better acquainted with each other and Eve subliminally warns Roger that the police are boarding the train, is some of the finest screen writing in any motion picture I've seen. It's never painfully obvious or needlessly confusing. It always has the right amount of wit, intelligence and charm. Cary Grant once again proves why he was one of Hollywood's greatest stars with his performance here as Roger Thornhill, arguably his best role in my mind. He's cool, clever, smart, handsome, everything you could possibly want from a leading man and then some. Eva Marie Saint continues Hitchcock's outstanding streak of phenomenal blonde female characters, and joins the ranks of Grace Kelly in Rear Window (1954) and Kim Novak in Vertigo (1958). Her physical beauty is natural and her wardrobe is lovely, but her character also has compelling features of her own. To talk any more about those features however would be delving into spoilers, so I won't. All I can say is that North by Northwest isn't just one of my favorite films from Alfred Hitchcock, it's one of my all-time favorite films. Everything works from the acting to the screenplay to the direction to Bernard Herrmann's tremendous musical score. Definitely don't miss out on this one.

I originally felt the reactions of the characters, especially Spacek, we're strange and often unusually. It wasn't until I looked back on the film that I realized these reactions and acting styles were a stroke of genius, as a way of portraying this story in a realist and powerful way. Amidst the incredible backdrops of wide open deserts and lush Forrests, we are given these absolutely incredible performances by Sheen and Spacek. You feel so invested into the characters and plot, you really care for them, even though Sheen's character, Kit, is rather cold-blooded. Spacek portrays a naive Holly brilliantly, going along with everything Kit says, as she feels they are deeply in love with each other. It's as if she sees the world through these eyes that create a dream-like reality, and these acts that Kit commits are alright, because he's older and loves her. Kit also looks at the world obscurely. He seems to see himself as a much greater, important man, instead of the mysterious and confused boy-like greaser he is. Sheen plays this brilliantly. They both believe, in some way, that they deserve more than they can have. Malick's simple yet powerful direction really gets this across, as the young and lost couple make their daring way across the Montana Badlands.

In 1954, Them!, with its monstrously large ants, kicked off a subgenre of sorts, the giant-insect movie, and Tarantula would follow in 1955. After The Deadly Mantis, The Beginning of the End (giant grasshoppers), Monster From Green Hell (giant wasps), Earth vs. the Spider and Attack of the Giant Leeches soon appeared to stun and amaze moviegoers. Unlike most of those other films, however, TDM featured a giant monster that was not the result of radioactive bombardment or an H-bomb blast, but that was just naturally humongous; a prehistoric entity released via natural phenomenon.In the film, the viewer witnesses a volcanic eruption that takes place near Antarctica, while our narrator intones the ominous words of Isaac Newton's Third Law of Motion For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. And, implausibly enough, this blowup near the South Pole soon triggers an earthquake near the North Pole, almost 7,900 miles away (!), which releases.... Anyway, cut to the intrepid men working at the polar DEW line, where odd events soon begin to transpire. Colonel Joe Parkman (Craig Stevens) investigates the demolition of a weather station, the downing of a C-47, and some very odd tracks in the snow. Before long, noted paleontologist Nedrick (!) Jackson (William Hopper, who many viewers will recall from his roles in The Bad Seed and 20 Million Miles to Earth) and museum reporter Marge Blaine (Alix Talton; a great screamer, as it turns out) join the colonel near the North Pole to join in the investigation, and Jackson isn't long in getting to the bottom of things, declaring In all the kingdom of the living, there is no more deadly or voracious creature...than the praying mantis!Of all the giant-monster films mentioned above, The Deadly Mantis is most reminiscent of The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, the granddaddy of them all and, in my humble opinion, the greatest dinosaur movie ever made. Like the 1953 film, it too opens in documentarylike fashion and with a dry, scientific narration. The monster in both films is first observed as a radar blip near the North Pole, and both pictures feature discussions regarding the thawed-out mammoth remains that had recently been discovered in Siberia. In both films, our prehistoric creature attacks a fishing trawler off the Canadian coast and is ultimately destroyed near a NYC landmark (Manhattan Beach in the former; in the depths of the Manhattan Tunnel in the latter). But whereas Beast had boasted the truly awesome stop-motion FX of the late Ray Harryhausen, Mantis had to make do with FX of a lesser-calibre, more traditional kind. Still, the creature looks impressive enough on the ground, if a tad silly while in flight. The film contains at least four memorable sequences our first glimpse of the creature, from below, as it towers over a bunch of fleeing Greenlanders, who swarm away in kayaks out to sea; the creature's attack on the DEW station, repulsed by both rifle fire and flamethrower; the mantis' ascent of the Washington Monument; and finally, that Manhattan Tunnel windup, as Parkman and his men toss 3RG chemical mines at the mantis in an already densely foggy environment. (This denouement might bring to mind the storm drain finale in Them!) For once, the use of stock footage is well integrated; the footage used is crisp and clean and actually looks as though it had been shot for the film in question. Surprisingly, the first 1\/3 of The Deadly Mantis, before we even get a glimpse of our monster, might be the film's best section (an Arctic tour de force, according to the Maltin Classic Movie Guide), slowly building suspense in an intelligent manner against its snowbound backdrop. The picture has been surprisingly well directed by Nathan Juran, although perhaps it is unfair of me to use the word surprisingly; Juran, after all, would go on to helm such cult favorites as 20 Million Miles to Earth (released just one month later), The Brain From Planet Arous, Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad AND First Men in the Moon (those last two WOULD benefit from Harryhausen's participation). TDM also features a love triangle of sorts--seemingly obligatory in many of these '50s sci-fi films--that is a tad surprising, as pretty Marge does NOT wind up with the guy you might be expecting. In all, a satisfying, nicely realized and intelligent monster movie, and perfect fare for viewing with your 8-year-old nephew, of course.Further good news regarding The Deadly Mantis is that it comes to us today as part of Universal Studios' Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection, and is presented via a pristine-looking print. On the same DVD disc can be found the film The Land Unknown, another B&W sci-fi outing from 1957 that also (strangely enough) clocks in at precisely 78 minutes and showcases prehistoric monsters in a polar setting. A perfect double feature, both films come highly recommended by this viewer, an admitted sucker for 1950s sci-fi. And speaking of that decade, back in the 1950s and '60s, I am old enough to recall, a NYC urban legend had it that there was a $1,000 fine for killing any praying mantis. Well, I'm sorry to report, baby boomers, that this popular myth just had no basis in reality, beneficial as these harmless, little insects might be. Beneficial, harmless and little...three words, surely, that would NOT describe our deadly mantis....
