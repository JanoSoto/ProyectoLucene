A must see film if you are bored by same daily routine films. A brainteaser for audiences force them to think.I don't know why all three installments of Matrix are having below 9 ratings. Actually there is no flaw in all these films. A evergreen script and action scenes you will watch over and over again! I liked this movie as it specifically meant us to think how the things act internally of computer literally. Also I come across the observation that the colors used for filming the particular is not for fun but they have given it meaning like The green color indicates the scenes inside the matrix, white color shows that the purity of the soul like scenes of sati, oracle. etc. Those who haven't still watched it, just download three parts and take a ride.
