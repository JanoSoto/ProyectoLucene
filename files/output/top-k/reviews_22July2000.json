I found the story to be very simple (good)  but ..well...  boring (bad). This short has a lot of questions to be answered, but never will be, in the same sense that.. say.. watching Scooby Doo will also make you go huh, well, why are they....?  Why would someone do that..? How is that possible? Oh never mind! The same with the Pokemon short.   I mean, overall, it was cute - no doubt - but I thought Pikachu's Vacation was at least amusing. The only laughs I got from this was from making snide side-comments. Sorry -)   I would give this, as a standalone grade... 40%   The animation was only of video-release quality.. with some rather crappy moving cel effects that had little-to-no animation on them at all.OK, now we have The Power Of One movie. Animation This was OK.. It's not the best anime you've ever seen - heck, the first episode of Tenchi Muyo on Cartoon Network was better animated, and that was only released on straight-to-video... never as a movie. But, there were times where it had that typical anime action that I love so much. The 3D CGI animation was very nice, and the blending of 2D cel with 3D backgrounds was pretty good - it was effective. I liked the 3D CGI versions of the 3 Legendary Birds for the scanner readout. You'd think that they could get a much higher budget for this cartoon, since it's made everyone involved sooo much money.. but.. oh well  shrugs shoulders Greed rules... and if you can get away with OAV-quality animation and still make 60 million.. hey... Nintendo's not complaining.Characters They had something going with Misty's jealousy over Ash.. but they didn't do anything about it. Ash nearly drowns..  we ALL expected her to give him mouth-to-mouth... but... alas. I suppose they thought it would have been a bad idea to show what amounts to a 10-year-old and a 14-year-old kissing. The evil dood, Lawrence III, is a nicely Neutral character.. he's sorta evil.. but not malevolenty so.. although he IS willing to let the whole world go to pot just so he can have a perfect collection of Pokemon. I liked this self-incrimination part of the story.  However, Lawrence III is completely WASTED as a plot device... and as such the movie scores low. Overall, he was a COMPLETELY USELESS character, that could have been replaced with another plot concerning itself with a natural disaster or suchlike - and would have resulted in perhaps a more Indiana Jones-type movie of exploration to try to save the world.Story Well... it was good... but it felt like I was watching two movies. One movie was about Lawrence III wanting to capture all the Legendary Birds to flush the Marine King out, and being thwarted by Ash and Friends... and the other movie was about Ash and Friends trying to save the world due to impending ecological meltdown, because the 3 Legendary Birds are fighting each other. Save for a scene where Lawrence III tries to capture Lugia, and a scene where he picks up the Ancient Mew card and vows to start all over... he is missing from the second part of the movie. Isn't he at least a bit p***ed at Ash for sinking his floating city? How about trying to stop Ash from spoiling his plans? No.. he just disappears from being an important antagonist.As I said before, the movie's main problem is that Lawrence III is a completely useless character. If you're gonna have a collector villain that's even more uncaring about pokemon's feelings, or ecological protection than Giovanni, then USE HIM. Have the battles not only for the 3 Birds, but for the 3 Gems too. Wouldn't a collector like to have the raw power of the birds themselves? Why are you going to let a boy ruin your plans?Also, the climax of the movie seemed to be an anticlimax. The sinking of the ship was nice.. as was the race to Ice Island and back...  but after that - feh.  It wasn't as surprising as in the fight with MewTwo, when Ash gets killed - At least surprise us with a kiss from Misty to Ash, maybe. I suppose the jealousy angle was a good surprise - too bad they didn't play it more.I dunno - if the story had been more unified... rather than being two storylines in one... I think I would have enjoyed it more.Still, I give it a generous 75%. I'm sure other people may wonder why it's so high... well, I *did* enjoy myself. Even at $9 a ticket, I thought it was alright.

I saw The Devil's Own later on in it's theater release to see a movie with my sister, and I was expecting your typical Hollywood thriller.  But I walked out of that theater really moved by what I had just seen.  The Devil's Own has some of the best acting ever portrayed by it's two leading actors, and directing by acclaimed late director Alan J. Pakula.   Harrison Ford looked and felt like he was a cop who had worked for twenty plus years in the force who was unwillingly thrown into an awkward situation.  And Brad Pitt, with his very authentic accent, also looked and felt like an Irish Republican whose life was torn by an early childhood incident that would impend his future tragic actions. When these two actors were in the same scene, you only wanted more of these scenes when they went through.  But what really moved the film was the story. The two main characters were so fleshed and rendered out in the film, that it made me want to know a lot more about them outside of the film as well.   To have seen what Harrison Ford's character was doing before the arrival of Brad's, to see how he ran his job and what his daily life was like.  Or to have seen what Brad's character would be doing if he had never met Harrison's character at the end, and instead gone away successfully. But what we got with the movie is fine enough, flawlessly directed by Alan J. Pakula.  He perfectly managed to fit in strong acting with a strong absorbing story, perfectly keeping its material away from all of the other Hollywood mainstream movies.  I'm not quite sure why this movie was so overlooked by the public.  Maybe it didn't have Harrison quoting his usual one-liners, or maybe it wasn't dark enough for the Brad Pitt fans, but either way I am glad to have seen it myself.  I have left this review virtually spoil free because I only hope that one day other people see this film and realize what a wonderful and moving film this was, from the late and great Alan J. Pakula.

The Devil's Own has some of the best acting ever portrayed by it's two leading actors, and directing by acclaimed late director Alan J. Pakula.   Harrison Ford looked and felt like he was a cop who had worked for twenty plus years in the force who was unwillingly thrown into an awkward situation.  And Brad Pitt, with his very authentic accent, also looked and felt like an Irish Republican whose life was torn by an early childhood incident that would impend his future tragic actions. When these two actors were in the same scene, you only wanted more of these scenes when they went through.  But what really moved the film was the story. The two main characters were so fleshed and rendered out in the film, that it made me want to know a lot more about them outside of the film as well.   To have seen what Harrison Ford's character was doing before the arrival of Brad's, to see how he ran his job and what his daily life was like.  Or to have seen what Brad's character would be doing if he had never met Harrison's character at the end, and instead gone away successfully. But what we got with the movie is fine enough, flawlessly directed by Alan J. Pakula.  He perfectly managed to fit in strong acting with a strong absorbing story, perfectly keeping its material away from all of the other Hollywood mainstream movies.  I'm not quite sure why this movie was so overlooked by the public.  Maybe it didn't have Harrison quoting his usual one-liners, or maybe it wasn't dark enough for the Brad Pitt fans, but either way I am glad to have seen it myself.  I have left this review virtually spoil free because I only hope that one day other people see this film and realize what a wonderful and moving film this was, from the late and great Alan J. Pakula.

I found the movie to be more enjoyable than I expected, but it lacked the epic quality one associates with these types of films. For example the scenes at the Statue of Liberty were very modest--not as spectacular as they could have or should have been. It was very claustrophobic--much like a tv movie of the week on Fox.In fact--that is what this movie seemed to be made for television. It is unfortunate that Fox not only slashed the budget on this film, but also forced the filmmakers into a summer rather than Xmas release.As for the plot, without revealing too much, I will only say that the threat of mutant registration came across as rather lame. Could this idea have come about because of the budget restrictions? I would have preferred something more grand--like legislation to allow the military to use a virus to seek out and neutralize mutants. Now that would have been a threat--and Magneto's response in the film would have been more understandable. Furthermore--the Nazis are featured early in the film. This sequence was truly dead weight. It was jarring and not as relevant to the story as some may suggest. It would have been cheaper and more effective to have Magneto talk about his childhood when he is facing Xavier--or Senator Kelly. On the plus side--Sterwart and Mclellan did the best they could with their roles, but the real stars were Jackman and Paquin. They brought some emotional power to this flick--while the rest of the cast were not well developed.I understand that there were scenes removed from this film to cut the running time down--perhaps they would have improved the film, but not enough I suspect. I certainly did not find this film to be as disappointing as Batman, but it didnt soar like Superman either.

Watching Michelle dive into the water would make you run and take diving lessons, if that was truly her! Their acting made the story believable, and when the story's believable I always enjoy it.

Rather, they're merely a backdrop upon which countless hand-to-hand fights and slapstick humor are placed, and while they're not necessarily thought-provoking, they are by no means a waste of time to individuals who enjoy more intellectual entertainment.But with Twin Dragons, it appears as though the story did indeed destroy the movie, to the point where even the action scenes couldn't salvage the film from its inherent ennui.The film's worst traits are perhaps its predictability and repetition.  For example, in the beginning we are introduced to the two single elements which will play out implacably for the remainder of the film confusion in regards to which of the twins is who, and how when one of the twins performs one action, the other is psychically affected and carries it out as well.  The film apparently thrives on this to the point where it becomes tiresome after about half an hour, and the manner in which it does it leads one to seriously question the mental capacity of the individuals involved.  Never in a movie have I seen women portrayed to be such imbeciles.A couple of the action scenes are worth mention, but the unfortunate aspect of the matter is that unless one watches them separately from the rest of the film, there really isn't much to attract attention.  That is, by the time that we have been subjected to the asininity of all the supporting characters in the dialogue sections of the film, we really do not want to see them partake in the fights--and more than once I found myself wishing that the screenwriters had done away with these characters earlier in the story so as to not involve them in any but one or two of the action sequences.For the casual movie watcher, I would consider this to be poison--stay away at any cost, even if you're paid to watch this film.  Die-hard Jackie Chan fans may enjoy a couple of scenes, which display a little wit as to how to incorporate Chan's natural charm into the eccentricity of the situations, and some of the stunts are somewhat impressing, though nowhere near the caliber of some of those that he has performed in the latter half of the '90s.

Mr. Ebert, I hope you come to the comment section of this movie one day and realize the mistake you made when talking %&@$ about this flick.         Now, about the movie.....1) I've made EVERYone I know so far watch Empire of the Sun. The movie is SO MUCH a part of me that I feel people will understand me better if they watch this movie.2) It's extremely addictive. I can't even COUNT how many times I've seen it... but I ALWAYS CRY during the same certain scenes. Like when the British guy (on the roof) shakes Jim and tells him not to think so much. The way Jim reacts. Sniff! I also cry when Basie tries to take the dead woman's shoes. How 'bout when the Japanese dude can't get his plane to start; his culture thereby branding him a loser?     There's certain scenes-and this is what I feel makes the film truly unique- where you look back and think you should have felt sad, but you didn't. This is intentional; like toward the end, when one of Basie's crew shoots Jim's Japanese friend. This is because Jim has transformed into a more bitter, cold, but even stronger person, so the scene should not be so emotional, as much as a bit hopeful, accepting, but still dreamy(when Jim performs the CPR on his dead friend.)3)What about when Basie wouldn't take Jim w\/ him to the airfield camp, the way Jim would do ANYTHING to get in the truck w\/him. Suzhou?! I know the way! My parents are members of the country club!4) The song, which I later heard for an Amex card commercial & sung by Charlotte Church on her Cd- Suo Gan- was best sung in this movie (just curious to know if 'teenage Jim's' salute while singing was actually sung by Christian Bale; I already know the choirboy solo in the beginning wasn't sung by him.)5) When I first saw this movie about 12 YEARS AGO(I'm gonna break the trend here, guys), I remember my favorite scene being the American pilot waving to Jim...man, how visually memorable. When I went to see it again, the kid in me connected w\/ what the kid in Jim was supposed to connect with(I think).............I'm not sure how to put it in words, okay, but something glorious. People keep saying things like 'that wonderful actor Bale' was 'just as great ' as a younger kid actor'....Umm...If you ask me, the way he impresses filmmakers (or the honeys) is to pop in his empire of the Sun tape  and they'd think, oh, well this prodigy actor has been asleep between then and now, but we'll give him another chance because we love what he did 13 ys ago. In short, Bale(though I LOVED Newsies & Swing Kids), will probably NEVER have a better performance than he did in Empire.This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.
