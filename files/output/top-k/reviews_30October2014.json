This movie loses the plot and tries to create a world different from the one which was created as an idea for a single panel comic and in a different time where the novelty has worn off.The comic and the TV show were both products of a day when people were learning to break out of the conformity of the 50's and early 60's. Goth hadn't become an industry yet which stores in the mall catered to.The TV show was *funny*. It wasn't subtle. You didn't have to listen closely to the TV show to get it.For example, there was a weekly sequence seeing regular people left running out of the house frightened for their lives, often using under cranked film (fast motion). (not unlike the stock joke of the Casper cartoons) In this movie, however, the house guests are about as weird as the Addams. There was no contrast.On TV, Jackie Coogan's Fester provided pure over the top belly laughs with a vaudeville like cadence. With his light bulb and self-destructive, one-man-three-stooges tricks (his regular headache cure gag), adding the sound effects made us all laugh out loud on a weekly basis.And let's not forget the fact that the original TV show actors defined those roles, esp Carolyn Jones and the guy (pardon me) who played Lurch. In this, however, Lurch dropped into the background. Thing had a much bigger role (thanks to CGI, we completely lost the box which was kind of the joke). To be sure, Angelica Houston was very good, but I thought they played up the sex\/romance a half-note too much for what was really a kids show.Lastly, as a point of art, the TV show was in black and white, which was fitting for the macabre theme. This movie, however, was a lush production and the attention to detail was fantastic.But furniture doesn't make me *laugh*. (although I remember the laugh track on the TV show tried to make us laugh at it) Often, movie adaptations of TV shows will take some lingering question from the TV show and actually address it. Like, where did Gomez and Morticia meet? What exactly is Thing? (who is way overdone in the movie, thanks to CGI) So many missed opportunities.Instead, they create an story about Fester which was never part of the TV show, introducing a main character (the lawyer) which wasn't part of the original show, and again, focus on a very well done set design (yawn) to weave a story (the vault) which only takes you farther away from the characters you fell in love with or any real jokes.Perhaps it's because we have so many more choices today that humorous doesn't cut it any more.Interesting and pretty but outside of the pre-title sequence gag, simply not funny.

If you wanna kick it old school, most would say BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. In recent years, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS could hold a fight for that title. I would easily put this movie up for submission in that debate. In my head, there is a list of the 200 or so greatest horror movies of all time. While very few would be sequels, this would make that list.If you are going to start your assessment of this movie by comparing it to the original, then naturally it's not going to hold up as much. Carpenter's masterpiece is one of the greatest horror films of the modern era. Few thrillers or horror films have ever been able to match the sense of tension and suspense that was created by the original movie. Carpenter, essentially, created the mold that would be used for every slasher film to follow and it was not going to be an easy film to follow.There are many reasons that Carpenter is considered to be a master of horror and Rick Rosenthal was pretty much never heard of again. Most of the suspense that made the first so great is gone in this sequel. However, just as the original set the blueprint for what slasher films would follow, this helped set the blueprint for what a slasher sequel would follow. It has replaced the artistic touch by going over-the- top in its' approach. There is more death and more gore. The dramatic approach to making him an evil entity is taken to the extreme of making him a superhuman unstoppable force.The end result is a movie that still stands as one of the best slashers of the 80s. In later sequels, Michael may have become a mockery of himself, but he's in full terrifying presence here. As he stalks a wounded Laurie through a darkened hospital that is a claustrophobic feel that heightens the sense that there is no escape from this evil. The kills are creative without getting ludicrous. This is a genuinely scary movie. Special nod to the razor blade in the gums scene with the little kid which was the scene that scared me the most as a lil one, having grown up in the late 70s\/ early 80s in the height of trick r treat hysteria, I became convinced this would happen to me one day.There are, also, some odd things in this movie which lower the rating a bit. Why doesn't Loomis recognize his associate from the loony bin? Why is Laurie the only patient in this entire hospital except for a few babies? How did a psycho like Michael, who was imprisoned at a young age, learn a word like Samhain and what does it have to do with wanting to kill his sister? Then again, as a tried and true horror film, I just sort of roll with things like this and forgive them as the little eccentricities of the genre.I would put this above any sequel from the Friday, Elm Street or Chainsaw series.

I'm that guy that has a room full of posters and toys and most are devoted to the creatures from Universal's classics. This love goes way back to childhood when I used to sit on the kitchen floor and draw these monsters over and over. So, why am I boring you with these details? Because all that time, I always discounted The Invisible Man. He wasn't monster enough for me and the movie never captured my imagination like its' brethren in the Universal lineup.That all changed as I got older. I realized how marvelous this movie really is. Frankenstein and Wolfie are tragic figures, with destinies far beyond their control. Dracula and Imhotep really just want their lost loves back. Poor Creature just wanted left alone. The Invisible Man, though, is a purely homicidal maniac and may just be the most evil of all the Universal monsters.What really carries this movie is Claude Rains' performance as the title character. Until the closing moments, we never see his face, so he has no chance to emote anything through facial expressions. Instead, we are treated to a magnificently over-the-top performance as the doctor's mind slowly unravels through the film. What starts as a slightly unhinged leave me alone sort of irritability becomes a megalomaniac who has no problem derailing a train to prove his power. It's not all dastardly doctor, though, as he get some glimpses into the nuttiness of his mind, too, with silly little songs and gleeful laughter that help show how unraveled he's become.The special effects are really impressive, considering the age of this movie. Sure, you can see some of the seams, so to speak, as a modern viewer, but given the age of this movie it's astounding to me that they pulled off some of these shots. They're basically doing blue screen work with nothing more than black velvet clothes and a black velvet backdrop. If I have one big negative, it's James Whale's insistence on casting Una O'Connor in his movies, who just may be the most annoying actress in the history of movies. I don't know if she was funny to a viewer in the 30s, but I can't imagine that shrieking voice was ever anything but grating.

There are chances that most of the lines won't be immediately gotten at the first viewing, but don't worry, the film is known for being very hard to follow, in plot and words.Still, isn't that the mark of great movies to have a little something that will inevitably make you eager to watch it again? Directed by Howard Hawks, The Big Sleep is one of these films where one experience isn't satisfying at all, especially story -wise, you feel the need to watch it again, because it's one of the most convoluted and complex plot you'll ever have to follow, just as if you were tailing a Jaguar, while driving a tractor. But the secret of its greatness is that while you watch it a second time to understand it better, you end up understanding why it's regarded as one of the greatest film noir, Bogart movies, American movies and stop caring about the plot.And why should we care about it, the plot is so complex that even the starting mission is liable to confuse viewers. Philip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's most iconic creation, is engaged by an elderly general to look for a man who blackmails his daughter, he mentions some gambling debts and the mysterious disappearance of Shawn Regan, a former member of the IRA who worked for him, and Marlowe's army buddy. At that point of the film, we try to memorize their names, but a few scenes later, they'll only be part of a never-ending chain of events where each twist leads up to a new plot within a plot.A blackmailer using a library as a front for illegal activities, a slutty spoiled brat, Sternwood's youngest daughter, Carmen, magnificently played by Martha Vickers, a mysterious murder followed by the death of a chauffeur named Owen Taylor. No matter how focused you stay, you'll lose it sooner or later, depending on your attention span, the film is a real challenge for concentration. Yet there seems to be some logic in the way events follow each other. It seems to obey the same pattern, whoever possesses an information will immediately be killed before (sometimes unknowingly) giving part of it to Marlowe. The point is to use a gun to make them talk before someone will use it to silence them forever. Roles can be switched though, but the way to the solution is paved by warm cadavers. There's another pattern, every encounter with a female, is full of sexual innuendo, starting with an irresistible exchange with Dorothy Malone as the scene-stealing librarian, perhaps one of the most erotic Bogie moments, there's a sort of modern chemistry in the raving beauty of Malone, the way she twists her tongue, and innocently take off her glasses and loosen her hair, provoking the perfect reaction from Bogie Hellooooo. And who can't resist to the female cab driver giving her number and telling him he can call any time. Day or night? Night's better, I work during the dayI said in To Have and Have Not, also directed by Hawks, that Bogie found his match in Bacall, on that level, The Big Sleep is one hell of a matchbox. Yet, if all the girls never quite overshadow Bacall, they're just here for the show, TO show Marlowd, the private eye, as a man with lots of charisma with women, but he doesn't fool around, he's got an obvious fondness on one of them, Viviane, Carmen's sister. It's still a Bogart and Bacall movie, so I just saved the best for last. Again, at a time where their romance wasn't secret anymore, Howard Hawks, the matchmaker, knew how to exploit their chemistry again and create another classic with the most legendary Hollywood couple. And the fact that is a Bacall movie is crucial for another reason; we know it'll lead up to our two leads in each other's arms, that's the point, so the rest, starting with the story, hardly matters. The merit of great movies is to reinvent the rules of screen writing, not everything has a point, except allowing the crime investigation to progress, and the only possible outcome is the romantic reunion, the climax of all these interludes where together, talk in coded messages, full of risqué innuendo, to better hide their feelings, whether it's a racy debate about horses, or a hilarious prank call that show how screen writing wasn't just meant to make the plot evolve.Legend has it that neither Bogart, nor Hawks knew who and how did the chauffeur die, not even the author &#x85; but who cared what was in that black briefcase in Pulp Fiction or was 'Keyser Soze' a made up person or not &#x85; some questions are better left unanswered, and that's part of their legend. And in a film whose only purpose is to showcase extraordinary abilities of screen writing transcended by tremendous acting talents, why being so orthodox about the rules of storytelling, confident writers make their own rules.

Braine was at the centre of the Angry Young Men literary movement of the 1950s (although in reality there was no movement as such - just a coincidence of good writing by young writers troubled by the social mores of the times). Set in a northern town, and with a symbolic background of chimneys and the daily grind, Room at the Top is about aspiration and ambition - about how a determined, clever, handsome young man, Joe Lampton (Laurence Harvey) finds room at the top for himself artfully and by trampling over a few hearts along the way. New to the town of Warley - a step up from his more downmarket home town - Joe declares early his intention to succeed.

Susan Brown (Heather Sears) falls for Joe and he sees not just the challenge (easily overcome) of breaking down her barriers but also her potential usefulness to him in his determined climbing of the ladder. Whilst decorative and useful Susan Brown inspires no passion in Joe - but he also meets Alice Aisgill (Simone Signoret), older, beautiful, physically stunning, married, unhappy. Susan is prettily naive but Alice is worldly and desirable. Lampton's seduction of Susan is carried out clinically and dispassionately. His affair with Alice is the real thing - for both of them. When it becomes known to Alice's husband George (Alan Cuthbertson) the latter threatens Joe with financial and social ruin unless he breaks it off. This is a pivotal scene symbolising the Them and Us world of that time and place. Another symbol of the class divide is the portrayal by John Westbrook of Sarah's boyfriend Jack Wales. Wales, like Lampton, was in the RAF during the war and also like Lampton was a Prisoner of War. But where Joe was a humble Sergeant Wales was an Officer and a heroic escaper from captivity.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"30 October 2014","score":"","review":" Inspired by villains Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees, A Nightmare on Elm Street was released on November 9th 1984, and the world of macabre motion pictures was granted one of its greatest treasures, one that would take the idea of supernatural horror villains to the next level, for unlike any others here was a fiend with a face that leered right at you, a voice, and a definite personality, one that devised many twisted and cruel ways in which to psychologically torture victims with a gleeful passion, and whip them into a state of panic before delivering the final blow and destroying them within the realm of their own dreams, and his name was Freddy Krueger... This is simply a fantastic film, it's an utter classic, and a veritable masterpiece among horror movies and to me it was totally Wes Craven's best work. I love everything about it, it's so fiercely unique and special and has its own dark magical lore about it that makes it stand out from the rest to this day. The music score and distinctive sound design is my favourite horror score ever, as it elevates everything so beautifully and gives the film such a strong and memorable identity. The iconic jump-rope song alone probably forms a huge part of why this movie came to be so ingrained into the collective consciousness of horror movie buffs the world over for decades.. It moves at just the right pace and never seems to rush into anything, they make the most out of and flesh-out each moment so tremendously well, I never find myself waiting for it to end. What I most enjoy about it is how it so effortlessly and eerily blurs the line between dreams and reality... Just the idea is scary, I mean it's a concept that is literally the stuff of nightmares and while I don't find the scenes dead terrifying, it definitely takes you out of your comfort zone. It's been said, but it is something that we can all relate to, we're all at our most vulnerable in that state and no one can stay awake forever. And who hasn't ever experienced that kind of dread where you're having a really bad night terror where you're not sure you're gonna escape alive? The concept Craven came up with and how he expressed and inter-weaved it so perfectly into the overall environment and atmosphere of the story was just genius. It does get a little confusing when some of the dream stuff begins to mingle with the real world, like the hysterical tongue-phone, or when Glen's poor mother goes into his room and is somehow able to see the spectacular tornado of gore that she shouldn't be able to.. I take that as a clue to what I take as the meaning behind the chilling final scene as the questionable reality and structure of the film comes tumbling down as the suspiciously happy ending turns grim and everyone is whisked away by the Freddy-Mobile and mom is hilariously sucked through the door, and even that's kinda spooky! Anyway what I think is that at some point the movie became or perhaps always was, a dream-within-a-dream, and it ended that way and never came out of it. And if you watch with that idea in mind it's even scarier as it plays into the ambiguous and occasionally even ethereal tone.

The scariest image for me is the sight of Tina's body being dragged away by invisible hands, and the way she looks like a piece of meat as her hand flops to the ground - it's so good! The characters are all vital to the story, Heather Langencamp's Nancy most of all. She was an outstanding heroine, despite only being in one and a sorta sequels she remains the most memorable survivor girl of the series. She had a great realness to her and a level-headed resourcefulness, like she was just a regular person who wasn't so scared of dying that she wasn't willing to fight to try and solve the deadly mystery before it was too late. Her personality was strong enough to hold the center of the movie together, and although it's her and Englund both that are the stars, I find her more interesting because in this one at least, he's subtle and more of a shadowy bogeyman, a dark force to be conquered, and you root for her and want to see her kick his charred ass! Anyway that said Freddy's still awesome and very different in his original appearance, he hides in shadows and all you mostly see of his face are his amused mad eyes and he's just more threatening and ominous, and it was more than just a great-looking getup, Englund brought a lot of his own sinister body language to his most famous role. They may have made a complete clown of him eventually but as far as this film goes, he was a legitimate scary bastard! What's really amazing is that they did it all and achieved such macabre magnificence on a low budget, you feel how much effort was put into it - the movie works and always will.

This is simply a fantastic film, it's an utter classic, and a veritable masterpiece among horror movies and to me it was totally Wes Craven's best work. I love everything about it, it's so fiercely unique and special and has its own dark magical lore about it that makes it stand out from the rest to this day. The music score and distinctive sound design is my favourite horror score ever, as it elevates everything so beautifully and gives the film such a strong and memorable identity. The iconic jump-rope song alone probably forms a huge part of why this movie came to be so ingrained into the collective consciousness of horror movie buffs the world over for decades.. It moves at just the right pace and never seems to rush into anything, they make the most out of and flesh-out each moment so tremendously well, I never find myself waiting for it to end. What I most enjoy about it is how it so effortlessly and eerily blurs the line between dreams and reality... Just the idea is scary, I mean it's a concept that is literally the stuff of nightmares and while I don't find the scenes dead terrifying, it definitely takes you out of your comfort zone. It's been said, but it is something that we can all relate to, we're all at our most vulnerable in that state and no one can stay awake forever. And who hasn't ever experienced that kind of dread where you're having a really bad night terror where you're not sure you're gonna escape alive? The concept Craven came up with and how he expressed and inter-weaved it so perfectly into the overall environment and atmosphere of the story was just genius. It does get a little confusing when some of the dream stuff begins to mingle with the real world, like the hysterical tongue-phone, or when Glen's poor mother goes into his room and is somehow able to see the spectacular tornado of gore that she shouldn't be able to.. I take that as a clue to what I take as the meaning behind the chilling final scene as the questionable reality and structure of the film comes tumbling down as the suspiciously happy ending turns grim and everyone is whisked away by the Freddy-Mobile and mom is hilariously sucked through the door, and even that's kinda spooky! Anyway what I think is that at some point the movie became or perhaps always was, a dream-within-a-dream, and it ended that way and never came out of it. And if you watch with that idea in mind it's even scarier as it plays into the ambiguous and occasionally even ethereal tone.

Edward Norton and Robin Williams both did great in this movie. Trying to beat each other to win the kids hearts by taking some dark turns.

It has everything you would expect from a classic 80's action flick, explosions, guns, blood, suspense & classic one-liners from Arnie! Arnie and his team of commandos are called in to assist with a rescue mission in a Central American Jungle, a helicopter has gone down and they are sent in to locate any survivors. Before long they become targeted themselves by an alien hunter which starts killing them off one by one.The scenes before we see the Predator are very iconic and it is at that moment that you realise it is not your standard action flick. The first time we are introduced to the Predator is from its point of view. The crew of commandos will be down on the floor of the jungle and then it will switch to an infrared point of view from a birds eye location, watching them from the trees. You are shown the predator watching the humans, whilst making quite disturbing noises and breathing sounds. They are very effective scenes that add suspense and a nervous feeling to this movie.

But given the first three minutes, wherein viewers learn about well-publicized American serial killers, the script sets us up for a way too predictable plot.Even in small matters of business, like when the guys stop to get gasoline, we can see what's coming next. The plot offers very little in the way of surprises or depth. The script is too direct and too shallow. Dialogue lacks subtext. And characters are almost two-dimensional cardboard cutouts.

Each is given an important moment in the film, from the slashed whore Delilah to the one-armed deputy. And each is, to varying degrees, doomed.Yet for such an overwhelmingly dark movie, Unforgiven is full of light moments, touching moments, hilarious moments. English Bob, played with sardonic verve by Richard Harris, muses on the recent assassination of President Garfield. I mean, why NOT shoot the president? he asks. W.W.

So who'd you shoot first asks Beauchamp. I only know who's gonna be last, glowers Munny.The theme of who had it coming is central to Peoples' script. First uttered by Ned, Munny's running buddy from the bad old days, the sentiment is repeated by Alice, the head madam, and finally by the Schofield Kid as he ruminates on his first kill; this theme is summed up by Munny We all got it coming, kid. But two characters in particular do NOT have it coming. Ned, who balked at the opportunity to kill, is returning home when he's captured and later beaten to death by Little Bill. And Davy, who did not participate in the maiming of Delilah and even presents her with a horse as compensation, is only guilty by association. But in this movie, that's enough.Characteristic of Peoples' understated style is the scene of Will's departure from his failing pig farm. He visits the grave of his wife, who broke him of his drinking and killing ways. In any other movie, Will would speak a few lines, asking her forgiveness perhaps. Not here Eastwood simply sweeps some brush from the makeshift marker and moves on. There is not a wasted motion in this film, nor a single unnecessary line.Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are good friends in real life, and their camaraderie shows through in several strong scenes.

The vampires, too, prefigure the creatures in THE STRAIN (the teleseries) and The House of Pain has to be seen to be believed (it's where vampires go to feel something, which takes on a whole new meaning when you're a vampire and you have what amounts to super powers). The ending is identical to the ending of a script I submitted to the first season of TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE (titled VAMPYRE, about an undercover cop who goes all the way by allowing himself to be bitten by a vampire), another reason I really liked this one.
